&#13;
&#13;
This study provides a framework for comparison and benchmarking of administrative&#13;
expenditures of public and private social security programs. The paper presents the&#13;
genesis of the inquiries into the subject, reviewing some of the most relevant&#13;
literature on administrative expenditures and the costs of mandatory programs&#13;
produced over the past two decades. The quantitative analysis builds on the extensive&#13;
body of literature, but our framework evolved considerably from earlier studies. Our&#13;
dataset includes over 100 observations and a broad set of explanatory variables. We&#13;
developed and compared a number of standardized cost indices discussing their&#13;
advantages and limitations. We also discuss major cost components and their shares&#13;
in total program costs. The analysis explains over 90 percent of variation in&#13;
administrative expenditures. It confirms some of the hypotheses expressed in the&#13;
earlier studies and presents new evidence of driving factors for costs. We developed&#13;
three different specifications for statistical analysis. The first set looks at the impact of&#13;
design of a program on total costs. The second group of specifications assesses&#13;
differences in costs of managing pension liabilities between the public and private&#13;
mandatory pension schemes. Finally, on the basis of the third model we generate&#13;
benchmarks for staffing levels and for the total administrative expenditures. We&#13;
compare those to the actual indicators and develop standard performance ratios,&#13;
providing insights into design variations and performance of the programs. We&#13;
conclude with a discussion of data limitations and implications of our findings.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                     Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
This study was motivated by an interest toward determinants of the operating costs of&#13;
public social security programs and implications of policy reform for the institutions that&#13;
administer them. A simple comparison of the administrative expenditures of the different&#13;
types of schemes may often be misleading, and cost differentials do not always imply&#13;
inefficiencies. A comprehensive framework is needed to address various biases and make a&#13;
meaningful comparison of programs of different types, sizes, and organizations.&#13;
&#13;
There also is significant interest toward comparing performance of publicly versus privately&#13;
managed pension schemes. The wave of reforms with partial or full privatization of the&#13;
national social security programs in the 1990s and early 2000s along with the perception of&#13;
excessive charges imposed by the private providers generated a considerable body of&#13;
literature focusing on the private defined contribution (DC) plans. Yet, that type of research&#13;
generated few implications for the public schemes and institutions. While members of the&#13;
publicly managed programs do not bear the costs of administration directly, such schemes&#13;
have their own risks. Public programs are prone to agency problems, often resulting in&#13;
overstaffing, over-resourcing, or under-provision of quality services. Policymakers and&#13;
administrators often face the same operational choices and challenges under public or&#13;
private management, with cost implications. By focusing on the performance of systems&#13;
and institutions rather than on cost incidence, this paper offers a generic approach to the&#13;
cost analysis with some emerging recommendations relevant to schemes of all types.&#13;
&#13;
Our analysis builds on the extensive body of literature for both public and private pension&#13;
schemes. It summarizes key findings, lays out a new systematic framework for quantitative&#13;
analysis, and develops program-specific performance benchmarks for both labor resources&#13;
and operating costs. The framework evolved considerably from earlier studies. Our dataset&#13;
includes over 100 observations and allows for greater confidence of statistical inferences.&#13;
Our data has a broader set of explanatory variables and allows zooming in on functional&#13;
accounting of costs. Remarkably, our analysis explains over 90 percent of variation in&#13;
administrative expenditures among the observations of our sample. We confirm some of&#13;
the hypotheses expressed in the earlier studies and present new evidence of driving factors&#13;
for costs.&#13;
&#13;
Administration of mandatory social security programs is a complex operation. There are&#13;
significant systemic, institutional, and operational differences among the schemes.&#13;
Sometimes, the same agency operates multiple schemes that are very diverse in nature.&#13;
Often, one program can be managed by multiple agencies. We discuss several important&#13;
challenges in defining comparable cost measures and propose a set of guiding principles.&#13;
Availability and quality of the data is a major constraint as the data differs dramatically from&#13;
country to country and from institution to institution. There are significant heterogeneities&#13;
in how social security agencies report their operational and expenditure information. One&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               1&#13;
&amp;#12;clear recommendation emerging from this work is a need to promote standardized&#13;
reporting of operating costs, including functional accounting wherever possible.&#13;
&#13;
This paper consists of several parts. We first perform a structural analysis of costs and&#13;
review elements associated with various aspects of operations and their contribution to the&#13;
overall cost function. We also review several conventional cost indices, exposing&#13;
weaknesses associated with each type of cost normalization (including uses of gross&#13;
domestic product (GDP), revenues, expenditures, members, and so on). We present an&#13;
alternative index in which pension liabilities serve to normalize costs. We further discuss&#13;
common biases of normalization and summarize their impact on ten conventional cost&#13;
indices. Our key finding from this analysis is that the best normalization for comparative&#13;
analysis is achieved when using the number of members (or even better, beneficiaries only)&#13;
adjusted for the level of national income (for example, GDP per capita). With that measure,&#13;
we observed a group of countries with exceptionally high administrative expenditures.&#13;
Notably, from 21 institutions in Sub-Saharan Africa in our sample, 14 agencies were in this&#13;
 outlier ategor . In all specifications of our regression analysis, this category was coded as&#13;
a separate qualitative variable and came out as highly significant.&#13;
&#13;
Among the key findings for both structural and regression analyses is unequivocal evidence&#13;
that the variable cost of benefit management is much greater than the cost of contribution&#13;
collection. Mere recordkeeping of the contributors does not seem to affect the staffing&#13;
requirements or overall costs in a significant way. However, the operation of contribution&#13;
collection and provision of additional services does, implying the importance of fixed costs&#13;
over variable costs for that line of business. This may be due to the fact that agencies do not&#13;
really provide direct service to contributors and mostly interact with their employers, so&#13;
statistical association with the number of contributors is loose. On the other hand, the&#13;
number of beneficiaries alone explains over 80 percent of the variation in staffing levels&#13;
(and hence, significantly, the total costs). This has important implications for the debate&#13;
over the proper institutional home for the contribution collection function. For a well-&#13;
established internal collection function, the argument for outsourcing and consolidation&#13;
with tax collection is weak on the basis of cost reduction alone. It does not mean that other&#13;
potential systemic improvements could not be achieved by such reforms (for example,&#13;
reduced administrative burden, possibly improved compliance, or overall improvements in&#13;
economic efficiency due to reduced informality). Yet, where significant investments are&#13;
required to establish or modernize a collection function, both tax and social security&#13;
contributions systems could benefit from a well-coordinated effort.&#13;
&#13;
On the benefit-management side, given significant variable costs, considerable economies&#13;
of scope may exist. This may argue in favor of consolidating various benefit programs under&#13;
a unified administration (for example, universal basic pensions and earnings-related&#13;
pensions, retirement benefits, and various short-term or other special benefits, especially&#13;
where these cover mostly the same groups of beneficiaries).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              2&#13;
&amp;#12;In our quantitative analysis, we develop three different regression specifications. The first&#13;
two are equivalent to cost normalization by members and by pension liabilities,&#13;
respectively. We investigate the effects of various elements of program design (such as&#13;
private versus public management, in-house collection, and special schemes) as well as the&#13;
level of economic development and the quality of institutions on current administrative&#13;
expenditures. These are the main observations:&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   In line with other studies, there are clear economies of scale (expressed either in terms&#13;
    of scheme members or pension liabilities). Yet, there are dramatic differences in how&#13;
    functions of managing services for beneficiaries versus contributors add to the overall&#13;
    cost function. The difference can be up to one order of magnitude.&#13;
ï&#130;·   The evidence of cost differentials of in-house versus outsourced collection is weak. One&#13;
    possible explanation is that the modes of organizing collection function vary&#13;
    significantly, so capturing such a variation under one categorical variable constitutes a&#13;
    measurement challenge. At the same time, managing special supplementary programs&#13;
    and benefits (such as health, unemployment, and member loans) produces notable&#13;
    increments in operating costs.&#13;
ï&#130;·   While the evidence of cost differentials between defined benefit (DB) and defined&#13;
    contribution (DC) schemes (public or private) is weak, the results show the strong effect&#13;
    of private management on the costs of pension plans. However, there are indications&#13;
    that this effect may reflect differences in the maturity and coverage of the schemes and&#13;
    thus fade in the longer term. We also observe that schemes that require the&#13;
    management of financial assets (DB or DC) produce incremental costs, indicating&#13;
    advanced complementary resources (both skills and systems).&#13;
ï&#130;·   The level of economic development has a strong impact on costs, suggesting that more&#13;
    developed countries can manage pension schemes more efficiently, possibly taking&#13;
    advantage of better technologies, infrastructure, and institutions. However, using the&#13;
    Government Effectiveness Index, we find that as technologies spread over time they&#13;
    may become less important in explaining cost differences, and what may ultimately&#13;
    matter is the quality of governance. We further find that as economies develop and as&#13;
    new technologies become available they lead to the substitution of capital for labor in&#13;
    managing social security programs.&#13;
&#13;
We then proceed to our third specification that is used for benchmarking operational&#13;
performance. That specification consists of two steps. The first step is to benchmark optimal&#13;
uses of labor resources in program operation. The second step is to benchmark levels of&#13;
current administrative expenditure. Notably, the spread between low and high estimates&#13;
for programs of the same size and same economic environment can be four-fold and is&#13;
driven by parameters of design and operation (for example, asset management function, in-&#13;
house collection, or operation of special supplementary schemes). This suggests that&#13;
inferences about the level of administrative expenditures should always be done keeping in&#13;
mind the institutional context for each program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              3&#13;
&amp;#12;We also produce individual benchmarks (in both labor resources and overall operating&#13;
expenditures) for each of the programs in our sample considering the nature of their&#13;
operation and their institutional context. We estimate the degrees of deviation from the&#13;
individual benchmarks and develop three performance categories: categor A is for the&#13;
programs that perform at or close to the benchmark; categor B is for the progra s that&#13;
moderately deviate from the benchmark; and ategor C is for the programs where&#13;
performance coefficients are more than double the predicted levels. Most of the programs&#13;
i ategor C are suspects for operational inefficiencies, especially those in which the&#13;
benchmark coefficients are multiples of the predicted levels. Out of the 11 programs where&#13;
the expenditure-to-benchmark ratio exceeds 5, 8 are located in Sub-Saharan Africa. For&#13;
programs in Uganda, Kenya, and Ghana, the ratios are 26, 15, and 11, respectively. It may&#13;
be easy to overspend when operating significant surpluses, which all three happen to have,&#13;
but excessive administrative costs certainly cannot be sustained as schemes mature.&#13;
&#13;
We conclude with remarks on the implications of data limitations, especially in the quality&#13;
of services provided by different programs. To properly interpret the results of comparative&#13;
cost studies, we point to the need to look beyond our results and use special operational&#13;
and beneficiary surveys to capture information on the performance and satisfaction of&#13;
various stakeholders with the administration of programs (including information on&#13;
processing times, compliance costs and various overheads, and overall perception of service&#13;
quality).&#13;
&#13;
This study provides a framework for analyzing the operational efficiency of public social&#13;
security programs. It also helps guide complex organizational transformations that involve&#13;
the reallocation of resources between functions, adopting new technologies, developing&#13;
synergies between multiple agencies, and outsourcing. Decisions on optimal investments in&#13;
systems, processes, and people require clear understanding of the key factors that affect&#13;
the costs of operating schemes of various types and scope.&#13;

&amp;#12;  I.   Introduction&#13;
&#13;
Mandatory social security programs play an important role in the lives of millions of&#13;
individuals by securing a stable income over their lifespan. The administration of these&#13;
programs is a complex operation defined by their objectives and design. For example,&#13;
retirement income programs that provide only flat benefits will not require the extensive&#13;
machinery of contribution collection and recordkeeping. In contrast, earnings related&#13;
schemes, especially individual retirement savings, will require not only elaborate&#13;
mechanisms of contribution collection but also provisions for individual accounts and the&#13;
management of assets.&#13;
&#13;
There is growing pressure to improve the efficiency of public social security programs and&#13;
constrain their costs. There also is significant interest in comparing the performance of&#13;
publicly and privately managed pension schemes. The objective of this study is to present a&#13;
framework for comparative analysis of operational efficiency for mandatory pension&#13;
programs and develop program-specific performance benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
A good illustration of efficiency improvements at work is an experience of continuous&#13;
administrative transformations within the Social Security Administration (SSA) of the United&#13;
States. Figure 1 shows how over a period of 20 years (from 1978 to 1998), the agency was&#13;
able to achieve significant unit cost reduction along with a 25 percent cut in the total staff in&#13;
the context of a 30 percent expansion of the beneficiary base over the same 20-year period.&#13;
The agency implemented a series of adjustments for technical efficiency and cost efficiency.&#13;
That is, the agency attempted to produce greater output with the same or reduced&#13;
resources and attempted to alter the combination of labor and capital in the pursuit of&#13;
further cost reductions by adopting new technologies. Other examples of similar efficiency&#13;
improvements include the Marshall Islands Social Security Administration and the Swaziland&#13;
National Provident Fund. These agencies recently implemented dramatic reforms, resulting&#13;
in efficiency gains and a 30 percent reduction in their staff.&#13;

&#13;
Conceptually, there are three types of questions concerned with efficiency: (1) for a given&#13;
level of resources, is the output maximized (technical efficiency); (2) is the combination of&#13;
resources the most optimal (cost efficiency); and (3) does the output represent the optimal&#13;
product for the society (allocative efficiency or effectiveness)?&#13;
&#13;
Several studies have attempted to measure the technical efficiency of public pension&#13;
programs (that is, if members are serviced in the most cost-efficient manner and if public&#13;
transfers operate at the optimal cost). Our study builds on that analysis but also attempts at&#13;
benchmarking cost efficiency in the utilization of labor resources for given types of&#13;
programs and technology.&#13;
&#13;
The focus of allocative efficiency is on whether systems offer services that best fit the needs&#13;
of society. There are several categories of studies of this sort. Some discuss alternative&#13;
designs or organizational modes (for example, whether contribution collection or&#13;
management of assets should be centralized, with specific focus on identifying economies&#13;
of scale and scope). Others look at the tradeoffs in spending resources on improving&#13;
services for current beneficiaries versus expanding coverage of existing programs to new&#13;
members. Yet others investigate dynamic allocative efficiency in benchmarking the optimal&#13;
packages of services over time as economies develop.1&#13;
&#13;
Finally, there are aspects of equity in the allocation of the total cost of operating social&#13;
security among different groups of plan members and general public. Those are studies that&#13;
1&#13;
    For example, Robalino et al. (2008) and Palacios et al. (forthcoming).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                    6&#13;
&amp;#12;look at the incidence of costs across participants with different incomes, demographics, or&#13;
participation profiles.&#13;
&#13;
The focus of quantitative analysis presented in this paper is on technical and cost efficiency.&#13;
Allocative efficiency or equity is outside the scope of our study (although we do develop&#13;
and suggest cost estimates that could guide the allocative efficiency analysis). The fact that&#13;
different countries adopted different types or mixes of products complicates the task of&#13;
comparative analysis as an efficient combination of resources for one type of program may&#13;
be suboptimal for another type of program. Therefore, a simple comparison of the costs of&#13;
widely differing types of schemes may be misleading. Additionally, more complex programs&#13;
allow for greater variation in the quality and types of services, so cost differentials should&#13;
not always imply inefficiencies. Even within the same class of programs, benchmarks of&#13;
operational efficiency are difficult to obtain. Box 1 raises questions on the consistency of&#13;
policy advice in the absence of such a framework.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                     Box 1. Reforms of the Croatian Pension Insurance Institute&#13;
&#13;
        The World Bank was involved with providing support to the government of Croatia&#13;
        since the early stages of reform for its national pension system. In 2002, in the&#13;
        do u e t Croatia: Pe sio â&#128;&#156; ste I est e t Proje t, a Wor ld Bank team noted&#13;
        that the [a]dministrative costs of the pension system in Croatia are unjustifiably&#13;
        high, and reflect significant inefficiencies and overstaffing in the Pension Institute.&#13;
        Currently, these costs run to 3.7 percent of total benefits, while 2 percent is a typical&#13;
        share based on international experience. Reducing these costs to regular levels&#13;

        However, by 2006, in a follow-up do u e t e titled Proje t Paper on Restructuring&#13;
        Pe sio â&#128;&#156; ste I est e t Proje t for the Repu li of Croatia, a e tea&#13;
        recommended that [ ]y the end of 2007 CIPI should reduce its administrative costs&#13;
        from 1.8 to 1.2 percent of pension expenditures and improve its productivity by 20â&#128;&#147;&#13;
            per e t. The reader should note that while over the five-year period the cost&#13;
        index did drop below the originally suggested benchmark, the suggested additional&#13;
        30 percent reduction lacks sufficient justification. While the agency was undergoing&#13;
        some structural changes around that time, it is exactly this lack of a consistent&#13;
        quantitative framework that produces such ambiguity in defining a reference point.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Costs may vary over time within the same program or as the program undergoes systemic&#13;
changes. They also vary across countries often for the same program types even after&#13;
adjusting for the size of the schemes and other important factors. In this paper, we use&#13;
tools of quantitative analysis and data on administrative expenditures and operational&#13;
setup to develop a framework and assess the technical and cost efficiency of institutions in&#13;
charge of public retirement programs. High administrative expenditures may be a symptom&#13;
of inefficiencies in some systems, but in other systems, these high administrative&#13;
expenditures may simply indicate public choice for systems of more diverse and high-quality&#13;
services that come with high costs. Factors of quality are very difficult to quantify (see&#13;
discussion in section 7). Those include, for example, better accessibility and greater variety&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      7&#13;
&amp;#12;of services, more competent staff and higher responsiveness of administration, greater&#13;
individual choice and more transparent systems, and effective enforcement and reduced&#13;
fraud. Better and more complex services require investments in systems and people.&#13;
&#13;
For example, a substantial part of the debate around reform of Social Security in the United&#13;
States has been focused on the types of services, efficiency, and costs of the reformed&#13;
administration. A lot of that discussion is around benchmarking and costing of different&#13;
bundles of services compared to the current set provided by the SSA.2 We provide a&#13;
summary of one of such studies in box 2.&#13;
&#13;
At the same time, there are some fundamental institutional differences across countries&#13;
that may create cost differentials for similar types of programs. As James et al. (2001)&#13;
indicate with reference to experiences of setting up individual account systems, [p]robably&#13;
the least-cost alternatives and trade-offs are available for industrialized rather than for&#13;
developing countries. Industrialized countries have access to existing financial institutions,&#13;
lo er tradi g osts, passi e i est e t opportu ities, a d ore effe ti e go er a e. [â&#128;¦]&#13;
In developing and transitional countries, particularly those with small contribution and&#13;
assets bases, investment costs are likely to be higher and the opportunities for reducing&#13;
fees lo er. In fact, we confirm this statement in our analysis and show that for less&#13;
developed countries, a substantial institutional cost premium may be unavoidable. Hence,&#13;
high costs may not represent a problem in itself but rather point in the direction of further&#13;
inquiries on a case-by-case basis.&#13;
&#13;
Important factors responsible for cost differences are scheme coverage, benefit generosity,&#13;
maturity of the program, and others. We discuss all of them and their effects in the context&#13;
of the data available for this analysis. We have collected data on operational organization&#13;
and various components of administrative expenditures for over 100 public programs&#13;
internationally (see annexes 1 and 2 for details), which is the largest sample among similar&#13;
studies to date. Our objective is to standardize presentation of administrative expenditures,&#13;
ensuring consistency in comparing schemes of different types and capturing some obvious&#13;
deviations from the expected performance of the various programs as projected by our&#13;
simulations. We also are interested in the composition of total expenditures and cost&#13;
components associated with various functions. While analysis is perhaps less conclusive&#13;
here, given the differences in cost accounting and gaps in information, it is instructive in&#13;
terms of the magnitude of various factors as they enter the total cost function. The analysis&#13;
also suggests considerable scope for standardization of accounting and reporting of costs&#13;
across these institutions.&#13;

&amp;#12;             Box 2. Cost Analysis of Reform Options for the U.S. Social Security Program&#13;
&#13;
         In a discussion of the possible centralized organization of the Individual Accounts (IA)&#13;
         of the reformed Social Security, Hart et al. (2001) look at two hypothetical models&#13;
         with basic and advanced levels of services. The higher-service program is intended to&#13;
         represent an IA program that would provide participants with as many features and&#13;
         services as those offered today by leading private providers of financial services and&#13;
         by employers who offer defined contribution plans, such as a 401(k). It, therefore,&#13;
         would require more extensive new information systems and processes. The authors&#13;
         note that for additional functions, the SSA would require an estimated 7,000 to&#13;
         33,000 additional employees under the basic- and higher-service IA examples,&#13;
         respectively. The range of additional operational costs is defined between US$0.7&#13;
         and US$3 billion (or the equivalent of an additional US$3 to US$15 per member,&#13;
         including both covered employees and active beneficiaries). These are significant&#13;
         increases compared to the current mode of operation, and hence, such cost analysis&#13;
         clearly cannot be ignored in the process of reform discussions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. First, we present the genesis of the&#13;
inquiries into the subject, reviewing some of the most relevant literature on the&#13;
administrative expenditures and costs of mandatory programs produced over the past two&#13;
decades. Our primary objective is to review the methodologies used, although each paper&#13;
comes with a rich set of findings and recommendations. We then present our set of&#13;
administrative data on the public programs and develop a number of standardized cost&#13;
indices, discussing their advantages and limitations. We also discuss various major cost&#13;
components and their shares in total costs. Finally, we proceed with simulations on the&#13;
basis of our data and develop three different models. The first model looks at the impact of&#13;
design of a program on its total costs. Our second group of model specifications assesses&#13;
differences in costs of managing pension liabilities between the public and private&#13;
mandatory pension schemes. Finally, on the basis of the third model we generate&#13;
benchmarks for staffing levels and for the total administrative expenditures. We compare&#13;
those to the actual indicators and develop standard performance ratios, providing insights&#13;
into the differences in the performance of various programs.&#13;
&#13;
 II.   Formulating the Research Question&#13;
&#13;
The first notable generation of comprehensive research inquiries into the subject of&#13;
administrative expenditures and efficiency of mandatory pension programs internationally&#13;
was produced in the early-to-mid 1990s. The focus was primarily on exploring&#13;
administrative inefficiencies and on benchmarking operational performance by comparing&#13;
expenditures of the public and private pension plans with centralized versus decentralized&#13;
modes of organization. Two types of approaches emerged: one in which cost indices were&#13;
constructed on the basis of recurrent program expenditures or revenues and another in&#13;
which costs were measured as applied to individual members (either as one-off charges or&#13;
as cumulative costs over the period of plan participation). The latter measure emphasized&#13;
the incidence aspect, bringing analysis from the macro-level down to micro-level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     9&#13;
&amp;#12;One of the most comprehensive early studies that adopted macro-methodology is found in&#13;
Mitchell et al. (1993). Their sample of the costs of managing national social security&#13;
systems, including retirement programs, dates back to 1986 and includes 25 countries of&#13;
Latin America and the Caribbean and 24 countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-&#13;
operation and Development (OECD). The costs were defined quite broadly as expenditures&#13;
borne by the state to provide certain inputs in exchange for services of the social security&#13;
system. They did not differentiate between particular types of retirement programs or cost&#13;
incidences in different schemes. To explain cross-country differences, the cost function&#13;
included the explanatory variables of technological and infrastructural characteristics,&#13;
program organization, and the level of national income as a proxy for input prices. The&#13;
studies show that administrative expenditures of social security systems exhibit&#13;
considerable economies of scale and cannot be explained simply by technological&#13;
differences in the production of such services across countries.&#13;
&#13;
James and Palacios (1995) point to fundamental difficulties in measuring and comparing the&#13;
administrative costs of mandatory systems. They explain some of the differences by quality&#13;
differentials, subsidized operation, and the non risk-taking nature of the public sector&#13;
provisions, concluding that pu li l       a aged old-age programs tend to understate their&#13;
true administrative costs and overstate their efficiency relative to privately managed plans.&#13;
They also indicate biases of simplified cost ratios, particularly evident in immature or small&#13;
and poor systems (which we discuss in greater detail below). They propose a measure that&#13;
would better reflect various internal and external factors that affect costs as administrative&#13;
cost per member over income per capita, although recognizing that it is only a crude&#13;
adjustment for the higher input prices and the higher-quality services. This study perhaps&#13;
also is the first effort to compare individual systems to their corresponding benchmarks.&#13;
Statistical analysis on the basis of a sample of 50 countries indicated that national schemes&#13;
in Austria, Chile, Finland, and Kuwait cost more to administer than predicted by the model,&#13;
while schemes in Canada, Denmark, and Mauritius that feature universal flat benefits cost&#13;
less than predicted.3&#13;
&#13;
Bebczuk and Musalem (2008) also made an attempt at benchmarking operational efficiency&#13;
of public pension programs, although on the basis of simple cost ratios. They find that the&#13;
group with the most inefficient programs includes Belize, Sierra Leone, Fiji, Tanzania,&#13;
Philippines, Costa Rica, and South Africa. They exhibit a ratio of operating expenses to gross&#13;
income between 24 percent and 5.5 percent. Their intermediate group includes Jersey, New&#13;
Zealand, Ghana, Egypt, France, the United States, Japan, and Ireland. The ratio of operating&#13;
expenses to gross income here ranges between 3.3 percent and 1 percent. Finally, they find&#13;
that the most efficient countries are Denmark, Sweden, Ecuador, Guatemala, Singapore,&#13;
&#13;
3&#13;
 Our analysis that follows confirms these findings for Canada, Denmark, and Mauritius while also indicating&#13;
that Finland operates close to its benchmark. For corresponding programs in Australia, Chile, and Kuwait we&#13;
did not have data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     10&#13;
&amp;#12;Korea, Finland, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia, where the operating expense ratio is below 1&#13;
percent of gross income. These findings should be interpreted with care given serious&#13;
limitations in the simple cost indices. We further discuss biases of these measures.&#13;
&#13;
Valdes-Prieto (1994) zooms in on four national programs and compares the costs of public&#13;
and privately operated schemes in Chile, the United States (including both public and&#13;
voluntary private schemes), Malaysia, and Zambia, focusing specifically on different types of&#13;
services offered by each system. This is one of the earliest studies that adopted a micro-&#13;
approach that captured and converted all lifetime member costs (before or after&#13;
retirement) to the equivalent charge ratios and subsequently to the annual absolute cost&#13;
per member. It also is one of the few studies that explicitly accounted for the costs incurred&#13;
to the beneficiary after retirement.4&#13;
&#13;
By the late 1990s, in the United States, the discussions of privatization of the U.S. Social&#13;
Security program were at their height, generating a significant body of literature on the&#13;
organization and costs of various alternative provisions. Diamond (1998) was one of the&#13;
most influential studies on the topic, where issues on the cost measurement of privately&#13;
managed pension plans were summarized. Around the same time, the interest in comparing&#13;
the operations of publicly and privately managed programs intensified. This occurred as&#13;
reforms of public pension schemes unfolded in a number of countries with the shifting&#13;
mandate for retirement income provisions from the public to private sector. Systemic&#13;
reforms resulted in significant changes in the machinery of administration with partial or full&#13;
privatization. Other countries were closely watching and contemplating similar reforms.5&#13;
This prompted the second generation of studies of the costs of mandatory pension plans.&#13;
However, the focus this time noticeably shifted toward privately managed schemes and to&#13;
the cost incidence with analysis of the effects of various charges levied on plan members.6&#13;
Much of the literature on the subject was generated from Latin America and transition&#13;
economies of the former socialist block. The new schemes were fully funded and resulted in&#13;
&#13;
4&#13;
  Using the early experiences of the Chilean insurance industry providing annuity products, the study shows&#13;
that under reasonable assumptions up to 50 percent of all the costs of individual pensions could be incurred&#13;
after becoming a pensioner. Since the time the study was published, however, the insurance industry has&#13;
significantly evolved, premiums have substantially decreased, and products have grown in diversity.&#13;
Mackenzie (2002), for example, indicates that today most annuitants in many OECD countries can expect to be&#13;
subject to costs between 5 and 10 percent for converting lump sums into an annuity. Furthermore, Rocha and&#13;
Thorburn (2006) conclude that today Chilean annuitants have a deal that is even better than annuitants in&#13;
other countries, which is in part explained by the large supply of indexed instruments in Chile.&#13;

  Where no national mandatory schemes existed or where coverage was limited, the focus of discussions was&#13;
often on reforms of the civil service pension programs as well as sustainable and cost-effective initiatives of&#13;

6&#13;
  Valdes-Prieto (1994) suggested several reasons for differences in costs and charges; for example, due to&#13;
implicit subsidies of publicly managed programs and profit margins and indirect taxes by private pension&#13;
providers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      11&#13;
&amp;#12;accumulation of assets under the management of private providers. Typically, under such&#13;
settings, operations are no longer subsidized and costs get passed on to members in the&#13;
form of implicit or explicit charges. The charges were of different types and applied at&#13;
different times throughout the accumulation and payment phases. When combined and&#13;
compounded over time, such charges can consume a significant part of future benefits.&#13;
Hence, the authorities recognized the need to analyze and regulate costs to protect plan&#13;
members against excessive charges.&#13;
&#13;
In line with Valdes-Prieto (1994), a number of studies began to emphasize a lifetime&#13;
approach to measuring the cost incidence of charges in both voluntary and mandatory&#13;
pension schemes. For example, Murthi et al. (1999) indicate that various fees accumulated&#13;
over a lifetime could consume over 40 percent of individual pension account value in the&#13;
U.K. Mitchell (1999) produced standardized presentation of costs with simulations on the&#13;
basis of data from the new mandatory pension program in Mexico and found that&#13;
depending on the assumptions, over the long term, on average between 30 to 40 percent of&#13;
contributions could go to fund commissions. (While not significantly different from&#13;
aggregate commission loads in neighboring countries that introduced similar reforms, the&#13;
author discusses several factors that still would work both to increase and to reduce&#13;
charges in the new Mexican system in the medium-to-long run).&#13;
&#13;
Given the variety of types and rates of charges, such analysis requires standardization.&#13;
Building on Diamond (1998) and reflecting on the experiences of private pension industries&#13;
in OECD countries and approaches found in other studies, Whitehouse (2000) presents a&#13;
formal framework of interrelations between various measures of charges, including those&#13;
with equivalent effects on contributions (reduction in premium), on earnings (reduction in&#13;
yield), and on resulting accumulations (charge ratio).7 These indices provide for aggregation&#13;
of various types of charges over the lifetime of plan members and allow for consistent&#13;
comparison of fees across different plans, bringing multiple forms of charges to a set of&#13;
comparable indicators.8 However, as box 3 indicates, policy implications of these ratios in&#13;
the multi-pillar program context are not straightforward.&#13;
&#13;
With that framework, Dobronogov and Murthi (2005) surveyed early experiences of&#13;
reforms in Poland, Kazakhstan, Croatia, and Hungary. On the basis of available data, they&#13;
observed that over a i di idualâ&#128;&#153;s lifetime, the charges could result in an average of 1&#13;
percent reduction in yield or 19 percent reduction in assets of mandatory programs. Their&#13;
study also made an attempt at functional accounting of costs and investigated connections&#13;
between the charges and actual costs. While observing deficiencies in reporting of costs by&#13;
&#13;
7&#13;
  As one particularly useful observation, the analysis suggested a rule of thumb that under reasonable&#13;
assumptions and continuous plan participation over the long-term, a 1 percent charge against pension assets&#13;
is equivalent to a 20 percent charge on contributions.&#13;
8&#13;
  A related challenge is the disclosure of fees to plan members. For a comprehensive discussion of the issues&#13;
and a review of the situation in selected OECD countries, see Turneri and Witte (2008).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     12&#13;
&amp;#12;pension providers, their simulations suggest that for private individual accounts to be&#13;
viable, they should be funded by a minimum contribution of 4â&#128;&#147;6 percent of wages. This is&#13;
the only benchmark of that kind of which we are aware. In many countries, however, the&#13;
rates of supplementary mandatory or voluntary pension contribution remain quite low,&#13;
which raises questions regarding the financial viability of such policies.&#13;
&#13;
Palacios (2005) also attempts to determine the relationship between costs and charges and&#13;
finds a high correlation between the two. Furthermore, the author uses a sample of 49&#13;
pension fund managers from 8 countries of Latin America and finds significant economies of&#13;
scale (on both the cost per contributor and per affiliate basis). He discusses the implications&#13;
of an alternative organization of systems by centralizing the management of funds and&#13;
critiques that approach.&#13;
&#13;
Corvera et al. (2006) investigate the performance of the pension industry in Latin America&#13;
and apply the same methodology to 67 pension managers in 10 countries that operate&#13;
mandatory private pension programs in the region. They find significant dispersion of&#13;
charges both across and within the countries and produce a ranking of providers according&#13;
to the equivalent lifetime cost effect on members. While some of the cross-country&#13;
variations can be explained by differences in the services provided, the limited competition&#13;
as well as the presence of state-owned managers is blamed for the differences within a&#13;
country.&#13;
&#13;
Tapia and Yermo (2008) adopted a simplified methodology to compare the effects of&#13;
various fees and charges. Their indicator of equivalent annual reduction in yield is the sum&#13;
of all annual charges in U.S. dollar terms divided by total assets, without any extrapolation.9&#13;
The small size of their sample (18 countries) did not allow for a regression analysis of&#13;
various factors; hence, they looked at some of the key factors independent of each other.&#13;
As a result, the discussion remains largely inconclusive. Apart from an evident relationship&#13;
between the adopted measure and the maturity of the systems,10 the results did not&#13;
provide clear evidence of the impact of size or concentration of the industry on charges.&#13;
However, they point to the potential effects of those factors along with the nature of the&#13;
collection system, composition of the investment portfolio, and others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9&#13;
  Diamond (2011) uses these estimates to debate alternative modes of institutional organization of the&#13;
national DC pension plans and implications for costs to members, arguing for a centralized system with&#13;
wholesale interactions with fund managers.&#13;
10&#13;
   Results suggest two different groups of countries: a set of countries from Latin America and a set of&#13;
countries from Central and Eastern Europe that are more recent reformers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      13&#13;
&amp;#12;                Box 3. Cost Incidence and Multi-pillar Pension Programs&#13;
&#13;
Application of indices proposed in Whitehouse (2000) is quite common, including in the&#13;
context where new DC schemes have recently been introduced on top of legacy DB&#13;
programs. Such indices are often used to scrutinize the cost efficiency of new private&#13;
pension schemes compared to legacy plans. One serious limitation of such measures and&#13;
of all similar indices, however, is that they do not capture differences in generosity of&#13;
various plans (see discussion in section 5). Thus, for example, a low charge against high&#13;
contribution (relative to wages a eat up ore of a i di idualâ&#128;&#153;s resour es o pared&#13;
to a high charge against a lower contribution rate. An individual will simply pay more in&#13;
absolute dollar terms to administrators for the former plan. We used sample data from&#13;
21 countries in GÃ³mez HernÃ¡ndez and Stewart (2008) to calculate and confirm high&#13;
negative correlation between the 40-year charge ratios and corresponding contribution&#13;
rates. So, small DC schemes often will be seen as expensive. Yet, this does not necessarily&#13;
imply their inefficiencies if put in the context of multi-pillar programs.&#13;
&#13;
Let us consider three alternative scenarios of a multi-pillar program in figure B3. Each&#13;
case is presented by an average absolute contribution amount to the legacy DB&#13;
component I (C-I) and new DC component II (C-II). The grey areas are average costs per&#13;
member in absolute terms. Case A represents the larger DC component, while cases B&#13;
and C have a smaller DC component. Keeping average costs per member constant, simply&#13;
by the design of the scheme and not any other intrinsic differences, plan B will show a&#13;
less favorable value for the reduction in premium for the DC component. However,&#13;
comparison between cases A and B would be incomplete without incorporating&#13;
administrative costs of the legacy DB component. When it is added, the result indicates&#13;
that in both cases the individual pays the same for the overall program administration.&#13;
So, purely from a cost perspective, it is hard to argue for either option. In plan C, the&#13;
legacy plan has quite high costs per member. While shares of the costs may be very&#13;
similar in both the legacy DB and new DC plans, the argument from the cost perspective&#13;
may well be for further expansion of a more efficient DC component.&#13;

&amp;#12;One immediate implication from that body of research is a need for a more detailed&#13;
analysis of the impact of organization of various systems on their administrative costs. Some&#13;
studies specifically focus on assessing the advantages of consolidated collection of pension&#13;
contributions with other social insurance contributions and income taxes.11 A report funded&#13;
by the International Federation of Pension Fund Administrators (FIAP) (2006) surveyed the&#13;
processes and costs of collecting pension contributions in 11 countries that implemented&#13;
mandatory defined contribution pension schemes, comparing them in the context of&#13;
multiple organizational modes of the collection.12 If anything, the study reflects the complex&#13;
nature of cost definition and measurement, given the multiplicity of agencies associated&#13;
with the collection function and varying incidence of costs.&#13;
&#13;
From a simplified binary framework adopted by FIAPâ&#128;&#153;s report, Anusicâ&#128;&#153;s (2005) work is a&#13;
serious improvement in terms of organizing the knowledge about the collection function&#13;
and assessing its cost impact.13 In response to inquiries into the efficiencies of unifying tax&#13;
and social insurance contribution collection, the study emphasizes a continuum of options.&#13;
It defines five specific modes of administration depending on the responsibilities of&#13;
different agencies over managing the flows of money and information on social insurance&#13;
contributions. It also captures operational costs of institutions that are directly responsible&#13;
for social insurance as well as the cost of functions performed by other agencies for social&#13;
insurance institutions. The author uses social insurance revenues, total social insurance&#13;
expenditures, and GDP as denominators to construct simple cost indices for a set of over 30&#13;
European countries.14&#13;
&#13;
There also have been a number of country-specific studies of administrative performance&#13;
and efficiency of the national mandatory social insurance programs.15 We provide a&#13;
summary of literature on the cross-country studies and select country-focused studies in&#13;
table 1.&#13;
&#13;
11&#13;
   See for example, Barrand et al. (2004).&#13;
12&#13;
   This study follows a framework defined in Demarco and Rofman (1999).&#13;
13&#13;
   For a more detailed analysis of the contribution collection process, see Fultz and Stanovnik (2004).&#13;
14&#13;
   Interestingly, the study finds no clear association between the mode of organization of the collection&#13;
function and administrative costs. Furthermore, the study does not confirm the hypothesis that a&#13;
consolidation of social insurance administrations implies lower administrative costs, suggesting considerable&#13;
lags in administrative savings as a result of such reforms, possibly due to political factors that slow down the&#13;
reform process. There are important dynamic problems, however, in measuring the cost impact of collection&#13;
integration overtime. First, the denominator changes over time (as a result of compliance improvements).&#13;
Second, moving functions from one organization to another implies a need for aggregation of costs pre- and&#13;
post- impact from all agencies involved in such a transfer.&#13;
15&#13;
   See, for example, Chlo           o Pola d a d Gru iÅ¡iÄ&#135; a d NuÅ¡i o iÄ&#135;            o Croatia. Yoo (2002) applied&#13;
a very innovative approach to the Korean Public Pension Schemes with the uses of the stochastic cost frontier&#13;
function model and a decade worth of panel data from the national pension agencies. The major observation&#13;
is that, on average, the Korean system could produce the same outputs at half of the current costs, suggesting&#13;
reforms with restructuring and management innovations, including operational integration of public pension&#13;
schemes.&#13;

&#13;
Finally, a significant body of literature exists on the operations of occupational and&#13;
voluntary plans.16 Research covers the span of issues from market organization of the sector&#13;
to benchmarking the performance of specific plans. A Toronto-based group CEM&#13;
Benchmarking Incorporated specializes in benchmarking the cost and performance of&#13;
investments and the administration of pension funds, foundations, and sovereign wealth&#13;
funds. It maintains one of the most extensive global databases for the private sector and&#13;
uses data to generate analysis and research with performance comparisons and insights&#13;
into best practices.17 These types of studies are quite relevant to public sector programs, as&#13;
the private sector is an excellent incubator for ideas and cost-optimizing solutions. Such&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
16&#13;
   For example, some earlier studies by Caswell (1976) and Mitchell and Andrews (1981) provide evidence of&#13;
economies of scale and explore the effects of other factors on the administrative costs of private pension&#13;
plans.&#13;
17&#13;
   Bauer et al. (2010) use that database (with observations from 463 DB and 248 DC funds over a period&#13;
beginning 1990) to study the performance of the U.S. pension industry. One interesting conclusion of that&#13;
study is that the DB plans may be better cost watchers compared to the DC plans, given incentives. An earlier&#13;
study on the basis of the same database by Lum (2006) indicates that adjusting for asset mix, size, and style,&#13;
Ca adia fu ds are the orldâ&#128;&#153;s lo est ost fu ds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                           16&#13;
&amp;#12;analysis generally provides direction on more efficient modes of organization for public&#13;
sector programs, especially those of small size or narrow statutory coverage.&#13;
&#13;
In closing this section, we again need to emphasize that it always is important to&#13;
differentiate the objectives of various cost studies and the questions that they help to&#13;
answer. While some studies help to access the effectiveness of a particular program, they&#13;
may not be very helpful in addressing the issue of efficiency. For example, using simple cost&#13;
indices may show that a program spends as much on benefits as on administration, which&#13;
may raise questions on the effectiveness of that particular program; at the same time, it&#13;
may operate efficiently from a technical perspective, that is, producing services or outputs&#13;
with the most efficient use of available resources. Alternatively, some mature programs&#13;
with broad coverage and generous benefits may look impressive in terms of the relative&#13;
share of expenditures that go into administration; however, such programs may be&#13;
overstaffed or overspending on other inputs.18&#13;
&#13;
 III.   Scope of Analysis&#13;
&#13;
 Cost esti ati g is [â&#128;¦] diffi ult i the est of ir u sta es. It requires both science and judgment. And, since&#13;
answers are seldomâ&#128;&#148;if everâ&#128;&#148;pre ise, the goal is to fi d a reaso a le a s er. (U.S. Government&#13;
Accountability Office [GAO], 2007)&#13;
&#13;
The incidence of costs of public pension programs will vary across countries. Some will be&#13;
directly or indirectly borne by the members of the program (active or inactive), while others&#13;
will be addressed with the general budget. Figure 2 indicates that the cost of running a&#13;
public pension program can constitute a substantive share of the covered wage bill, with&#13;
the median at 1 percent for a sample of 70 country observations. On the high end of the&#13;
spectrum, there are CNSS of Burkina Faso, NSSF of Kenya, GIPF of Namibia, NASSIT of Sierra&#13;
Leone, POPF of Botswana, SSNIT of Ghana, SNPF of Swaziland, and NPF of the Solomon&#13;
Islandsâ&#128;&#148;all with operational costs above 3 percent of the covered wage19.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
18&#13;
   James and Palacios (1995) find that Indonesia and Kenya spend 30 and 72 percent of contributions,&#13;
respectively, on administrative costs, which is more than they pay out in benefits. At the same time, Japan and&#13;
the United States spend 1 percent or less of benefits and contributions on operating expenses. Their statistical&#13;
analysis, however, indicates that both sets of countries are spending approximately what would be expected,&#13;
given their per capita incomes and the numbers of covered workers and pensioners. So they note that those&#13;
ratios raise questions about the overall wisdom of starting old-age security programs in small, poor countries,&#13;
but they do not tell much about the internal efficiency of those schemes.&#13;

&#13;
Ultimately, whether or not subsidized from public funds, most of the costs will be shared&#13;
among economically active individuals.&#13;
&#13;
There are issues of whether such total cost allocations are regressive and whether they&#13;
represent the most dynamically equitable outcomes. We do not directly deal with those&#13;
issues. Keeping that in mind and unless we explicitly mention it, we refer to the costs in this&#13;
paper as total expenditures associated with operating a public pension program. Clarity is&#13;
required, however, on what needs to be captured in the cost measure. In what follows, we&#13;
discuss several important challenges and propose a set of guiding principles. We do admit,&#13;
however, that in many cases the ultimate and accurate measures will be impossible to&#13;
obtain and the best we can do is rely on approximations.&#13;
&#13;
There are significant systemic, institutional, and operational differences in how public&#13;
pension programs are designed and managed. Often the same agency operates multiple&#13;
programs or the administration of one particular program can be distributed across multiple&#13;
agencies. We, therefore, identify three approaches to constructing the cost measures:&#13;
&#13;
    ï&#130;·    Programmatic. With the programmatic approach, the focus is on the overall&#13;
         administration of one particular scheme. So, when administration functions are&#13;
         shared among multiple institutions, all such related expenses get captured, and&#13;
         when one agency operates multiple programs, the costs of other programs get&#13;
         excluded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      18&#13;
&amp;#12;     ï&#130;·   Institutional. Under the institutional approach, the measure is constructed around&#13;
         one institution that manages one or multiple programs (or parts of such programs).&#13;
     ï&#130;·   Functional. The functional approach, in principle, allows for an across-the-border&#13;
         comparison of different institutional or operational elements but requires diving into&#13;
         the intricate details of functional organization of each program.20 Anusic (2005) is an&#13;
         example of a functional approach. Such an approach also is useful as it allows for a&#13;
         broader analytical context of the comparison exercise for pension programs, for&#13;
         example, by bringing in the collection side of tax administration or the benefit side&#13;
         of various mass payment systems.&#13;
&#13;
There are several expense categories of administrative systems that should be considered.&#13;
All administrations have to bear regular operational expenses in the form of labor cost,&#13;
office maintenance, supplies, utilities, and so on. In addition, they may incur significant&#13;
capital expenditures. They sometimes bear expenses that are not directly related to the&#13;
core benefit administration (for example, the SSA in the United States provides certain tax&#13;
processing services to the Internal Revenue Service [IRS]; similarly, some public pension&#13;
agencies have corporate mandates imposed on them by the state to manage certain&#13;
publicly owned businesses or assets, for example, state-owned recreation facilities). Some&#13;
in-kind benefits, such as rehabilitation services, can arguably be treated as both benefits&#13;
and costs. Other expenses are never incurred directly and come in the form of implicit&#13;
subsidies (for example, use of public assets such as office premises or other infrastructure)&#13;
or as opportunity costs (when office buildings form part of the pension assets under the&#13;
real-estate investment schemes for pension reserves). There also are expenses not borne by&#13;
the public administration but incurred by the participants (for example, in the form of bank&#13;
charges for contribution remittances or benefit payments).&#13;
&#13;
Whether it is a programmatic, institutional, or functional approach, all direct and indirect&#13;
current operational expenses related to the program administration should ideally be&#13;
included in constructing a consistent cost measure. Capital expenditures should ideally be&#13;
averaged out (or amortized) over several years; alternatively, they could be completely&#13;
excluded (which is the approach that we follow in our comparative analysis). Operational&#13;
expenses of various unrelated functions (for example, rehabilitation services) should be&#13;
excluded. We also recommend excluding all expenses for providing in-kind services (on both&#13;
benefits and costs).&#13;
&#13;
Formal or informal costsâ&#128;&#148;external to the program administrationâ&#128;&#148;are conceptually of&#13;
three types. First, bank charges and the like, while easier to capture or estimate, are often a&#13;
function of the overall efficiency of the national infrastructure and hence, are outside the&#13;
control of the pension administration. It would be ideal, therefore, to assess the efficiency&#13;
&#13;
20&#13;
 Proper functional accounting of costs in public plans is very rare. The only cases we are aware of include the&#13;
United States, Canada, and New Zealand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      19&#13;
&amp;#12;of the services provided by the financial intermediaries separately and exclude the&#13;
associated costs from the cross-country comparison. However, this is not always possible,&#13;
and in most cases, such costs remain part of the total expenditures presented in this&#13;
analysis. We further discuss the magnitude of these costs.&#13;
&#13;
Second, there often are numerous informal costs borne by the program members (for&#13;
example, fee for benefit claim facilitation service or postman fees). Informal fees are&#13;
interesting because they compensate for services that are otherwise inadequate or&#13;
unavailable and hence, arguably constitute an extension of conventional administration.&#13;
From this perspective, such facilitation fees transform conventional administration from a&#13;
low-cost or low-services scheme to a high-cost or high-services program, although altering&#13;
the incidence of cost in a less transparent manner. When there is a void in some areas of&#13;
formal administration, it gets quickly filled with alternative provisions. There are plenty of&#13;
examples of such arrangements. Experience shows that often a whole formal or informal&#13;
industry could emerge and fill the void of services, such as increased awareness or&#13;
understanding of scheme rules, contribution collection services,21 benefit facilitation,&#13;
complaints processing, and legal representation.22 All those direct costs to beneficiaries&#13;
often remain unaccounted. In the end, low-quality formal services often translate into&#13;
additional transaction costs for the beneficiaries.23 However, as long as we treat all service&#13;
altering arrangements as different and discrete packages, the issues of associated cost&#13;
differences pertain to allocative efficiency and equity and are not the focus of our analysis.&#13;
Box 4 discusses some other approaches to optimizing benefit packages from a cost&#13;
perspective.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
21&#13;
   In Chile, in order to perform electronic collection and support the payment of social security contributions&#13;
through the Internet, the pension fund administrators (AFPs) created Previred, an agency that has captured&#13;
the large companies market (FIAP 2006). The portal allows those who employ workers, both businesses and&#13;
home-helpers, and self-employed workers to make their monthly payments in an easy and secure manner.&#13;
The service is free for employers.&#13;
22&#13;
   In the United States, the National Organization of Social Security Claimants' Representatives is an&#13;
association of over 4,000 attorneys and other advocates who represent social security and supplemental&#13;
security income claimants. The members provide representation services for claimants (for example,&#13;
advocating change in the disability determination and settlement process).&#13;
23&#13;
   See discussion in Palacios (forthcoming).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       20&#13;
&amp;#12;                     Box 4. Limiting Program Coverage as a Cost-Controlling Strategy&#13;
&#13;
           There are important tradeoffs between coverage, the quality of services, and costs.&#13;
           Palacios and PallarÃ¨s-Miralles (2000) indicate that coverage is a function of the level&#13;
           of national income. This can be explained by several factors, including infrastructure&#13;
           and technological constraints. The costs associated with reaching out to individuals&#13;
           employed in less formal jobs or living in more remote communities could be&#13;
           excessive. Thus, limiting coverage of mandatory contributory programs often is an&#13;
           efficient mechanism of cost controls. Mandate often is defined on a sectoral basis&#13;
           with some professions or industries excluded due to the anticipated high compliance&#13;
                                   *&#13;
           and enforcement costs. Alternatively, some sectors set limits on minimum earnings,&#13;
           so that contributions would not be required from individuals with very low incomes,&#13;
           often providing services informally. Finally, there often are minimum participatory&#13;
           requirements for firms in terms of their size. As countries develop, they reduce these&#13;
           floors and accommodate greater number of beneficiaries at a lower cost.&#13;
&#13;
           Therefore, holding everything else constant, it will be inappropriate to compare the&#13;
           costs of delivering social security, say in India, with its current 10 percent coverage&#13;
           of formal contributory schemes and with a hypothetic 40 percent coverage by the&#13;
           same schemes. Those are two different products.&#13;
                 *&#13;
           Note: In the United States, participation in social security for various groups of&#13;
           workers was mandated only gradually over time. It was not until 15 years after the&#13;
           introduction of the social security system that the non-farming self-employed could&#13;
           join the system; the farming self-employed joined after an additional 4 years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Third, there are conventional costs of compliance with a contributory mandate in the form&#13;
of time and effort of employers spent on keeping records, preparing and filing returns,&#13;
making payments, preparing for audits, getting trained in new rules and procedures,&#13;
following up on various inquiries, and so on. There is a separate body of literature on&#13;
organization and costs of compliance with revenue collection (usually in the context of tax&#13;
payments). Contribution collection can be organized in many different ways. For example in&#13;
Egypt, employers send information on wage changes only once a year and to a single&#13;
agency, while in Chile, employers send detailed reports to multiple providers each month.&#13;
This implies differences in burden in different countries. Furthermore, if the collection of&#13;
data is not synchronized between various components of the mandatory program, it further&#13;
increases compliance costs. Slemrod and Yitzhaki (2002) based on their literature review for&#13;
the United States and a group of OECD countries o lude that [i] al ost all ases the&#13;
private compliance costs dwarf the public ad i istrati e osts of olle ti g ta es. Thus, by&#13;
minimizing public administration costs (that is, by not providing adequate services of&#13;
counseling or electronic submission), the costs are simply pushed out to the domain of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    21&#13;
&amp;#12;nontransparent compliance costs perhaps producing a heavier burden for smaller&#13;
businesses and the self-employed than for medium-sized and large firms.24&#13;
&#13;
In closing this section, it is interesting to note that different collection and recordkeeping&#13;
models may not necessarily produce differences in administrative expenditures but rather&#13;
differences in the distribution of resources in the cycle of benefit administration. Some&#13;
countries still have quite a weak collection and recordkeeping systems that do not even&#13;
provide for centralized or electronic facilities and rather shift the burden of recordkeeping&#13;
on employers who would have to support the employee claim of pension rights at the time&#13;
of retirement with valid records of earnings and contributions. This implies pushing costs to&#13;
the end of the administrative cycle of the program, that is, putting fewer resources in the&#13;
collection effort and more resources in claims verification and processing. So, the structure&#13;
of cost could be revealing of the maturity of the administrative systems. Arguably, the&#13;
legacy contributory schemes will have more resources in benefits processing, while more&#13;
advanced systems likely will spend more effort on contribution collection and in-house&#13;
record maintenance. As systems mature administratively, they will be strengthening the&#13;
collection side. The trend further is reinforced when new DC schemes get introduced with&#13;
their significant upfront data quality requirements.&#13;
&#13;
 IV.    Our Data and Structure of Costs&#13;
&#13;
Availability and quality of data differs dramatically from country to country and from&#13;
institution to institution. There are significant heterogeneities in how pension agencies&#13;
report their budgets and operational information. The truth is that those reports were&#13;
never meant to be standardized across countries. In collecting data for this research, we&#13;
adopt a set of standard definitions of cost categories. However, reporting norms and&#13;
practices often do not conform to our definitions. For example, we are not always able to&#13;
differentiate between labor and non-labor costs or segregate capital expenditures from the&#13;
current operating expenses. In a good number of cases, however, we are able to obtain&#13;
those details, which allow us to assess potential biases in cases where such breakdown is&#13;
not possible.&#13;
&#13;
We collected data from over 100 public social security programs around the world (see&#13;
annexes 1 and 2 for data description). Those programs vary in size. The smallest in our&#13;
sample is the Falkland Islands Pension Scheme with 600 contributing members. The largest&#13;
scheme is the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance (OASDI) program in the United&#13;
States that covers over 160 million active contributors and some 50 million beneficiaries.&#13;
The nature of the operation and institutional organization of the programs in our sample&#13;
&#13;
24&#13;
   As a cost-control measure in such circumstances, various simplified contributory regimes could be a good&#13;
alternative where compliance and collection costs are unreasonably high, if such are seen as a major deterrent&#13;
to coverage expansion. Again, in our study, we view these issues as pertaining to allocative efficiency and&#13;
simply control for them in our model without analyzing them in detail.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     22&#13;
&amp;#12;also vary. We were able to obtain separate data on at least 10 noncontributory pension&#13;
schemes. On the other end of the spectrum, there are a significant number of social security&#13;
institutions that offer a broad range of benefits, including maternity, child allowance,&#13;
unemployment, sickness insurance, and others.&#13;
&#13;
We used a combination of methods to obtain data. In most cases, the information was&#13;
obtained directly from annual statements and reports of the social security agencies or&#13;
other offi ial statisti s a aila le o the age iesâ&#128;&#153; e portals. We also obtained data from&#13;
around 25 agencies using a detailed questionnaire. Our objective was to collect information&#13;
on each agency as a whole with all its multiple programs. In some cases, we were able to&#13;
obtain data on separate programs or on institutions operating at the subnational levels (for&#13;
separate states, autonomous regions, or overseas territories), which increased the number&#13;
of observations for our analysis. The data includes the nature of the schemes operated by&#13;
each agency, coverage in terms of the contributors and beneficiaries, financial flows,&#13;
accumulated assets, staffing and number of offices, and the level and details of&#13;
administrative expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
Our main data set is presented in annex 1 and it includes both raw data expressed in the&#13;
national currencies and various indices constructed on the basis of that data (which we&#13;
discuss in the following section).&#13;
&#13;
To make our data set consistent, we report data on labor resources and administrative costs&#13;
related to the associated functions. Thus, where certain functions of an agency were&#13;
excluded from the analysis, we had to prorate both staffing numbers and cost allocations&#13;
associated with such functions (as we did, for example, with Medicare-related and&#13;
reimbursable services provided by the SSA in the United States). Conversely, if we combined&#13;
functions performed by various agencies under one observation pertaining to a particular&#13;
program, we combined both labor resources and total costs (like in the case of the Sri&#13;
Lankan Employeesâ&#128;&#153; Provident Fund that uses collection and other services provided by the&#13;
Department of Labor).&#13;
&#13;
4. 1.   Institutional organization and total expenditures&#13;
&#13;
To better visualize our data, we developed a typology of the administration of public&#13;
schemes reflecting varying degrees of institutional complexity, assigning higher ranks to&#13;
more complex organizational structures, as summarized in table 2.&#13;

Figure 3 shows median levels of administrative expenditure for each type of program in our&#13;
sample. We normalized expenditures by the total members25 and by beneficiaries only. We&#13;
further adjusted expenditures by the ratio of national incomes per capita in each country&#13;
and in the United States, which implies equivalent costs of running the same operation in&#13;
the United States. In constructing median values, we excluded a group of schemes that we&#13;
considered as outliers in terms of excessive costs per member adjusted for income&#13;
differences.26 From the 21 Sub-Saharan African institutions in our sample, 14 are in this&#13;
category.&#13;
&#13;
There is no particular pattern emerging from this analysis. For schemes that do not involve&#13;
recordkeeping of earnings, programs with DB (rank 2) require more resources compared to&#13;
flat-benefit schemes. The result for ranks 3 and 4 depends on the denominator used in&#13;
normalization. However, overall it is consistent: there is a significant increase in the per-&#13;
beneficiary measure, indicating extra costs associated with the functions of employee&#13;
record management and contribution collection. The drop in per-member costs for rank 3&#13;
indicates that average recordkeeping costs per member is much lower than the average&#13;
benefits management costs per beneficiary. This is entirely consistent with all other findings&#13;
in this paper. The drop in average costs of the most complex programs (rank 4) is a&#13;
challenge to explain. We associate it with important biases of this simple measure we use,&#13;
including program size, generosity, level of economic development, and so on. We discuss&#13;
them in greater detail in section V. In the regression analysis that follows, we did not find&#13;
categorical variables for different ranks of the programs consistently significant, except for&#13;
basic pension. However, certain elements associated with the nature of operational&#13;
organization of the programs did play a role in explaining cost differences.&#13;

whom records are kept in-house.&#13;

4. 2.   Key elements of the cost structure&#13;
&#13;
In what follows, we discuss key observations from the cost structures of various institutions.&#13;
&#13;
For 71 observations in our sample, in which we separately provided information on&#13;
expenditures on capital investments and depreciation, we found that the median for such&#13;
costs is only around 5 percent of the total administrative expenses. In some exceptional&#13;
cases, however, capital expenditures are up to one-third of the total operational budget (for&#13;
example, in the case of Maldives, which was in the process of establishing a new agency to&#13;
run a new national contributory program at the time of collecting this data).&#13;
&#13;
For 74 observations, the median share of the direct labor cost in current expenditures is 57&#13;
percent, although the variation is extremely broad from 6 to 90 percent, in part due to&#13;
reporting differences, with the lowest share of labor cost reported for the Swedish national&#13;
DC program and the U.S. Thrift Savings Plan for public sector employees (two programs&#13;
similar in nature of operation). We also note that for the 27 countries in which data on both&#13;
direct labor costs and asset management expenses are available, the correlation between&#13;
the sizes of those two cost components (as a share of total current expenditures) is negative&#13;
81 percent, implying that as systems accumulate and actively begin to manage considerable&#13;
financial assets, direct labor costs become insignificant in explaining total cost differentials.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                       25&#13;
&amp;#12;For 39 programs with available data on pension asset management expenses, such expenses&#13;
constitute 25 percent, as a median, of the total current expenses. (Only one-third of the&#13;
programs in this subset were DC schemes.) We find no direct association between the&#13;
volume of assets and the share of reported asset management expenses in total current&#13;
expenditures. At the same time, larger pools of assets are clearly less expensive to manage&#13;
on per unit basis, while for the smaller portfolios there is a significant dispersion in asset&#13;
management costs.27&#13;
&#13;
                                                                     Figure 4: Costs of Managing Pension Assets&#13;

&#13;
With 31 available observations on office rent expenditures, the median reported amount&#13;
constitutes 1.3 percent of the total current expenses. In the Netherlands, Northern Ireland,&#13;
Kosovo, and the Maldives, however, where accounting recognizes these costs more&#13;
explicitly, office rent expenditures reach a 10 percent share, which perhaps is closer to the&#13;
actual situation with such costs borne by the pension agencies.28&#13;
&#13;
The median for benefit delivery costs for 30 countries in which such data is available stands&#13;
at around 5 percent of the total current administrative expenditures of the agency. While&#13;
bank charges seem to be part of those costs, more analysis is required on the classification&#13;
&#13;
27&#13;
   We note, however, that such direct comparison does not take into account the composition of the portfolios&#13;
and the nature of the management practices.&#13;
28&#13;
   In Kosovo, the new pension agency that was established to manage a national DC scheme selected and&#13;
leased premises for its main office on a commercial basis. In Northern Ireland, assessment of the rent which&#13;
would be payable on an open market basis for most buildings occupied by the Social Security Agency is&#13;
charged to the age â&#128;&#153;s operati g ost, as part of otio al osts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                26&#13;
&amp;#12;of expenditures in that category on a case-by-case basis. In Romania, for example, where&#13;
such costs are reported at 54 percent of the total administrative expenditures, the benefit&#13;
delivery services have been outsourced. Another interesting observation is that the next&#13;
three most expensive delivery services are in neighboring Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia&#13;
(in the range of 40 to 50 percent of total administrative expenses). At the same time, in all&#13;
four countries, those costs as a share of the total benefit expenditures still are relatively&#13;
small (between 1 and 2 percent).&#13;
&#13;
We do not have data on the cost differences associated with various types of benefit&#13;
delivery, but as evidenced by our data presented in figure 5, as countries develop, they tend&#13;
to process a greater share of social security benefit payments through the banking system.&#13;
This perhaps is a function of the efficiency of the financial sector, costs of these services,&#13;
and program coverage.&#13;

&#13;
Finally, for five countries where we have information on the delivery of individual account&#13;
statements, the associated costs are small and range from less than one to five percent of&#13;
the total current administrative expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
4. 3.                  Functional analysis: contribution collection and benefit payment&#13;
&#13;
We also investigated resource allocation between the key administrative functions of&#13;
contribution collection and benefit payments. Explicit functional cost accounting has been&#13;
adopted so far only in a handful of countries, including the United States, Canada, and New&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                           27&#13;
&amp;#12;Zealand. We conducted a small survey with select public social security agencies and&#13;
requested, through special questionnaires, information on staff associated with the&#13;
functions of contribution collection, benefit payments, and all other staff (IT support and&#13;
maintenance and general management). For the nine agencies that operate in-house&#13;
contribution collection and for which we received such data, figure 6 (a) and (b) suggest&#13;
that benefit administration is much more resource-intensive than the process of&#13;
contribution collection on a per head basis. The difference between the presentations in (a)&#13;
and (b) is that in the former, one observation depicts one institution (with its collection and&#13;
benefit functions) while the latter expands the sample, incorporating additional agencies&#13;
that do not operate in-house collection function. Based on these observations, the&#13;
beneficiary payment side may require between 3 and 10 times more staff per member&#13;
serviced compared to the contribution collection side. We will further validate these&#13;
findings in our regression analysis.&#13;

&#13;
This finding has important implications for understanding member accounting in the cost&#13;
analyses. Specifically, for the same membership size, the programs that do only benefit&#13;
payments will always look more expensive on a per-member basis compared to the&#13;
programs that collect contributions and pay benefits. Therefore, for the same 100,000&#13;
members, it may seem to be more expensive to run a basic pension-type program relative&#13;
to a contributory scheme as measured on a per-member basis. Hence, it is important to&#13;
recognize that bias in any comparative analysis.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, some agencies operating multiple programs produce programmatic accounting of&#13;
costs (for example, in Canada, St. Kitts and Nevis, Sweden, and the United States). In fact, in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                       28&#13;
&amp;#12;some of those cases, given the different nature of the programs, we included separate&#13;
observations on those programs in our data set.&#13;
&#13;
     V.      Cost Normalization&#13;
&#13;
Having all current administrative costs aggregated and converted to a common currency&#13;
does not make them directly comparable given significant underlying heterogeneities in&#13;
program design, size, and institutional and operational setup. Some normalization is&#13;
required. For the purposes of reporting operational efficiency, we favor the measure&#13;
suggested by James and Palacios (1995), which is income-adjusted annual current cost per&#13;
member,29 and in this paper, we offer a more intuitive variation of it (see annex 2). At the&#13;
same time, justice needs to be done to other measures, and we now discuss the advantages&#13;
and limitations of various alternative indices broadly used in the literature. 30 As important&#13;
caveats of such analysis, we need first to consider several common biases:&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·         Maturity bias. This is evident when newer earnings-related schemes with very few&#13;
          beneficiaries and payouts turn out more expensive as compared to older and stabilized&#13;
          schemes.&#13;
ï&#130;·         Financing bias. This implies that noncontributory schemes or contributory schemes with&#13;
          significant budget subsidies cannot be compared with financially balanced contributory&#13;
          schemes, if contribution revenues are used as the denominator. (To address this, the&#13;
          sum of contributions and benefits can be used instead.)&#13;
ï&#130;·         Generosity bias. This bias reveals itself when the schemes of the same organization and&#13;
          coverage do not look the same when differences in the rules of accruals (or in&#13;
          contribution rates) are significant. Figure 7 indicates that the share of program revenues&#13;
          that finance administrative costs generally increases as the contributory mandate&#13;
          shrinks; however, the variation remains quite significant. (To remedy this problem,&#13;
          some use GDP as the denominator.)&#13;
ï&#130;·         Coverage bias. This bias will disqualify GDP as a useful denominator if various sector-&#13;
          specific schemes or schemes with very narrow coverage (by design or implementation&#13;
          outcomes) need to be compared.&#13;
ï&#130;·         Technology bias. Several studies point to the fact that more advanced technologies and&#13;
          better infrastructure are available in more developed countries, hence availing more&#13;
          cost-efficient solutions. This information is not easy to reflect in any of the cost indices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
29&#13;
   Based on their regression analysis, the authors note that the administrative costs rise at a much lower rate&#13;
than per capita income, owing to higher productivity of more developed countries. So, such income&#13;
adjustment overcorrects. This is in interesting contrast to Mitchell et al. (1993) that constructed proxies to&#13;
capture cross-country differences in production technologies but found them insignificant explanatory&#13;
variables in explaining cost differences of Social Security.&#13;
30&#13;
   Valdes-Prieto (1994) offers a related discussion of alternative indices with their limitations.&#13;
&#13;

                                                       29&#13;
&amp;#12;ï&#130;·    Operational bias. Biases of all sorts exist when resources are shared with other&#13;
     programs or functions to sustain operational synergies (for example, in contribution&#13;
     collection or benefit administration).31&#13;
ï&#130;·    Size and membership biases. These biases are quite a few and diverse. First, fixed costs&#13;
     imply that smaller schemes will be costlier to manage. Second, we point above to the&#13;
     implications of the composition of the membership bases (beneficiaries versus&#13;
     contributors) for per-member cost accounting. Third, we present empirical evidence&#13;
     that the number of inactive members may pose important implications for any measure&#13;
     used. Fourth, some programs provide service to special groups of beneficiaries, such as&#13;
     widows and the disabled, where additional administrative resources presumably would&#13;
     be required to assess eligibility. More generally, some programs require complex&#13;
     categorical or resource eligibility checks for potential beneficiaries.&#13;

Note: The sample includes only programs with the collection function operated largely in-house. The costs of&#13;
managing pension assets are excluded.&#13;
&#13;
The choice of the denominator for comparable cost measures is important. It needs to&#13;
relate to something that the social security system produces, such as delivery of a general&#13;
public good, administration of contributions and benefits, management of pension&#13;
liabilities, or servicing various members and beneficiaries. The following sections discuss&#13;
corresponding candidates for the denominator.&#13;
&#13;
31&#13;
  For example, it is common for the civil service pension schemes to rely on the personnel and payroll units of&#13;
various government branches and agencies to conduct public information and contribution collection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                      30&#13;
&amp;#12;5. 1.   Uses of national income, revenues, and expenditures in cost normalization&#13;
&#13;
Some studies use GDP as a denominator to normalize costs, which for the same coverage&#13;
and program type is sufficient. The problem, however, is that coverage is not the same&#13;
across countries or even across schemes within the same country. So, the coverage bias is a&#13;
major deficiency of this index.&#13;
&#13;
When the focus is on financial flows, conventional indices are composed on the basis of&#13;
contributions collected or benefits paid. We do report those indices in our table in annex 2.&#13;
However, these measures have the greatest number of biases associated with them, which&#13;
we report in table 4. At the same time, just as with other indices, comparison across&#13;
programs of similar size and design can be fair.&#13;
&#13;
5. 2.   Administrative costs and pension liabilities&#13;
&#13;
All retirement schemes, whether funded or not, are in the business of liability management.&#13;
If such liabilities can be clearly defined and measured, one could compare the cost&#13;
efficiency of various types of schemes on that basis. In figure 8, we use the estimated&#13;
Implicit Pension Debt (IPD) of selected unfunded or partially funded mandatory DB schemes&#13;
and reported assets of DC schemes (including provident funds) to normalize administrative&#13;
expenditures. For comparison, we also present data on combined equivalent annual&#13;
charges from private mandatory pension programs.32 Out of 52 observations for which we&#13;
had information on either total pension assets or IPD, 30 schemes are DC, including 12&#13;
schemes that are privately managed (see data in annex 2).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
32&#13;
   The numerator is the actual current expenditures of public programs and combined annual member charges&#13;
in private schemes. Hence, we ignore the difference between the costs and expenditures of operating private&#13;
programs assuming that profit margins at the national level are insignificant. In fact, Palacios (2005) reports&#13;
high correlation between the costs and charges in private plans.&#13;

&#13;
   The impressions that we get from figure 8 are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
 i.      There is significant dispersion in simple cost indices among DC schemes. It also appears&#13;
         that centralized publicly managed programs are necessarily the least costly&#13;
         arrangements compared to privately managed decentralized DC schemes, perhaps in&#13;
         part due to the following attributes of the public DC schemes in our sample: (a) some of&#13;
         them operate in less developed countries with relatively more expensive financial sector&#13;
         infrastructure, (b) additional costs of in-house contribution collection, and (c) smaller&#13;
         size of some of those schemes.&#13;
ii.      Unfunded DB programs seem much less expensive to manage. This is not a reflection of&#13;
         their greater efficiency but rather an indication that management of individual funded&#13;
         liabilities requires much greater effort, providing a public good of a completely different&#13;
         nature. For five countries that operate two parallel mandatory programs, the contrast in&#13;
         costs of managing funded versus unfunded liabilities is particularly striking (although&#13;
         given the discussion in box 3, not necessarily conclusive). We also note that the DB&#13;
         schemes in the sample are larger and more mature.&#13;
iii.     Contribution collection seems to be associated with some additional costs of program&#13;
         management. Nevertheless, the impact does not seem highly significant.&#13;
&#13;
   These observations are not without shortfalls, as the simple measure we use is subject to&#13;
   biases of maturity, generosity, and size. We further validate these findings with regression&#13;
   analysis in section 6.&#13;

&amp;#12;5. 3.    Per-member costs&#13;
&#13;
Using the number of program members as a means of normalization of costs seems&#13;
obvious. Unfortunately, the methods are not that straightforward and deserve a detailed&#13;
discussion. Our approach to membership accounting is based on the principle of liability&#13;
management. In broad terms, the business of pension administration is to (i) accumulate,&#13;
(ii) manage, and (iii) discharge the member pension liabilities. Hence, all those to whom&#13;
such liabilities relate should be generally considered members of the program. We discuss&#13;
these three components of pension administration and how we propose to count the&#13;
associated members under each component in greater detail.&#13;
&#13;
Under contributory regimes, the business of accumulating pension rights is encapsulated in&#13;
the contribution collection and processing function. Contributing individuals become direct&#13;
beneficiaries of administration services, and we consider them as members. There are&#13;
inactive members, or those without contributions, who also accumulate pension liabilities.&#13;
For example, in the context of operation of most European pension programs, certain&#13;
inactive member groups can constitute part of the category referred to as insured (for&#13;
example, students, military servicemen, or recipients of certain public benefits). In line with&#13;
our proposed definition of pension administration services, our approach is to count and&#13;
include all members who accrue new rights in a given period, including all members who&#13;
earn such rights without contributions.33 Furthermore, we count all members who are&#13;
directly supported by the mechanisms of the system, that is, who accumulate pension rights&#13;
and for whom the records are kept in-house.34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
33&#13;
   Our definition, however, provides for a minor complication of vesting, or minimum period of contributory&#13;
participation in the scheme to earn and in the future benefit from pension rights. For all practical reasons, we&#13;
suggest ignoring that issue, as in most cases some form of compensation, usually a lump sum payment, will be&#13;
provided to members who fail to earn the required minimum.&#13;
34&#13;
   An alternative approach to counting members would be to include all those who accrue benefit on a&#13;
noncontributory basis. While there is no contribution, the service of rights accumulation still is provided. This&#13;
applies to both noncontributory earnings-related civil service schemes and universal pension programs. In&#13;
some cases, such an accumulation process is literal and gradual and is related to the years of residency (for&#13;
example, Denmark) or taxable work (for example, Netherlands and U.K.). This approach helps answer an&#13;
important policy question regarding the cost differentials of alternative design options for the same group of&#13;
potentially eligible individuals. Hence, such an approach would help make inferences about allocative&#13;
efficiency. A pure mechanical measure (focusing only on benefit recipients of the noncontributory schemes)&#13;
will lack such insight. Furthermore, there are important caveats in using such indexes for inferences about&#13;
allocative efficiency and in the choices between different design options on the basis of costs. One could argue&#13;
that direct current beneficiaries of earnings-related schemes that provide survivorship benefit are both&#13;
contributing members and their families. Note that some DC schemes price such services separately and&#13;
collect a special premium to service survivors of current members. Following this logic, the DB schemes have&#13;
an implicit premium for survivorship benefit. If there is a premium, there must be well-defined beneficiaries.&#13;
At the same time, plain universal basic pension programs in most cases do not offer survivorship benefits. So,&#13;
while the latter schemes could be seen as providing coverage to all working age individuals (without&#13;
contributing), the earnings-related schemes with an implicit or explicit survivorship premium cover a smaller&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       33&#13;
&amp;#12;The liability management side of pension administration covers all those members of the&#13;
program who conceptually have legal claims against the total outstanding stock of pension&#13;
liabilities. That includes (i) all those currently contributing (or who otherwise accumulate&#13;
new pension rights); (ii) all inactive members who do not accumulate new rights in any form&#13;
but whose implicit or explicit rights still constitute part of the total liabilities managed by&#13;
the pension agency (often referred to as members with dormant accounts); and (iii) all&#13;
those currently in receipt of the regular benefits. While categories (i) and (iii) will be&#13;
counted as members under other components of pension administration services, our&#13;
approach is to exclude the second category (dormant accounts) from the definition of&#13;
members. Thus, this side of the pension business administration should not produce any&#13;
additional members for our count.35 Not all workers, however, regularly contribute,36 and&#13;

least one contribution in the last 12 months. Variations of this approach seem common in&#13;
how pension agencies report data on their active members. To provide the idea of&#13;
differences in the reported numbers of active contributing workers versus total accounts,&#13;
we present data from our survey in table 3.&#13;

In many cases, more than half of all accounts remain passive. The reasons for such&#13;
differences are few. In less operationally efficient systems, in which identification means are&#13;
weak, some workers end up having multiple accounts when moving from one employer to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
group of workers but also indirectly provide services to a broader group (those who can claim the survivorship&#13;
benefit). This observation may tend to equalize allocative efficiencies of the earnings-related and universal&#13;
schemes. One way of dealing with this issue is to exclude the survivorship element from the contribution rate&#13;
and to use adjusted revenues in the denominator for proper comparison.&#13;
35&#13;
   This approach, however, may constitute problems with incorporating closed earnings-related schemes into&#13;
the cross-program analysis, but that is a very small group of programs that do not attract significant research&#13;
interest.&#13;
36&#13;
   For analysis of contribution density, see Arenas de Mesa et al. (2004) who use household survey data linked&#13;
with the Chilean social security records for over 20 years.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                     34&#13;
&amp;#12;another.37 Other reasons include inactivity of accounts due to prolonged periods of&#13;
unemployment, temporary migrants, and members of specialized schemes (for example, for&#13;
civil servants) who left their employer and opted for deferred retirement.&#13;
&#13;
On discharge of pension liabilities or the benefit side of pension administration, the&#13;
approach may seem straightforward: all those in receipt of pension payments should be&#13;
counted as members. However, there are three types of issues here. First, there are lump&#13;
sum payments (for example, provident fund type schemes or new DC schemes usually pay&#13;
only lump sums or make arrangements with external annuity providers). Our approach is to&#13;
include lump sum payments along with regular payments in the count of beneficiaries.38&#13;
The second group of issues is associated with common benefits, such as survivor pensions:&#13;
some institutions report only family cases, others only beneficiaries (family members), yet&#13;
others report both. For our purposes, we recommend using the count of all beneficiaries&#13;
who are the actual collectors of the benefits. Finally, many pension agencies administer&#13;
benefits other than pensions. Those typically include various short-term benefits (sickness,&#13;
maternity, child, family, and unemployment allowances); special schemes (industrial injury&#13;
pensions); multi-pillar pension schemes; and several other assistance programs.&#13;
Conceptually, the institutional approach will dictate incorporating all the schemes managed&#13;
by the same agency and all those benefiting from such schemes into the institutional cost&#13;
measure. A programmatic approach focusing on the pension program only would require&#13;
some form of cost proration. In either case, on the practical side, while capturing the count&#13;
of beneficiaries of special, multi-pillar pension, or assistance schemes is relatively&#13;
straightforward, there often are problems with the availability or interpretability of the&#13;
count of beneficiaries of certain short-term benefits and other schemes.39 The provision of&#13;
such benefits, therefore, should be controlled in the cross-country comparison.&#13;
&#13;
In our analysis, we account for beneficiaries in two different ways. We combine the counts&#13;
of regular maternity, children, and family allowances with the numbers of pension&#13;
recipients, which constitutes our totals for the beneficiary numbers in all our results and&#13;
regressions. We also account for the provision of other benefits, such as sickness,&#13;
unemployment, health insurance, and personal loans. However, given the complexity of&#13;
measurement and interpretation of these types of benefits, we use a categorical variable&#13;
and activate it each time when at least one of these programs is available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
37&#13;
   A number of countries explicitly have recognized that problem and as part of the system modernization&#13;
effort implemented projects of record cleanup and consolidation.&#13;
38&#13;
   Arguably, the level of effort across these cases is comparable. One-off lump sum payments require&#13;
extensive regular certification as all first-time claims. Regular (monthly) payments while less resource&#13;
intensive are numerous.&#13;
39&#13;
   For example, as is often the case with short-term health benefits, there are risks of double counting when&#13;
the same members are covered and benefit from multiple insurance programs.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;These factors should be carefully considered in the choice of the denominator in universal&#13;
indices. Table 4 summarizes various options, including associated biases.&#13;

Let us illustrate some of these biases at work. There is a maturity bias associated with (2):&#13;
younger earnings-related schemes that cannot be compared to some older stabilized&#13;
schemes (see the example of Kosovo in the table in the annex). Financing bias is present in&#13;
(1): noncontributory schemes or contributory schemes with significant budget subsidies&#13;
that cannot be put on the same line of comparison with fiscally balanced contributory&#13;
schemes (see the cases of New Zealand and Netherlands). To address these problems,&#13;
often, we find that a composite measure (3) is used. However, there is another generic&#13;
problemâ&#128;&#148;generosity biasâ&#128;&#148;as schemes with the same organization, coverage, and&#13;
operational costs will not look the same when differences in the contribution and/or benefit&#13;
rates are significant (for that reason programs in Poland and St. Kitts and Nevis, while very&#13;
similar in relative coverage and institutional organization, cannot be directly compared). To&#13;
remedy this problem, some would use the administrative costs per GDP ratio (4). This&#13;
measure, however, has its own problem, a coverage bias. Consider, for example, the&#13;
provident fund for the formal sector employees in India (EPFO), civil service pension plan in&#13;
the United States (TSP), and the national pension program in Estonia (managed by SIB). In&#13;
these cases, the differences in total cost per GDP measure for SIB and TSP are dramatic&#13;
(almost 80 times), reflecting differences in the relative size of those programs in the&#13;
economy (and perhaps additional institutional subsidies that TSP receives). However,&#13;
income adjusted per member costs are almost the same for SIB and TSP. At the same time,&#13;
while the cost per GDP is 3 times smaller in EPFO than in SIB (with labor coverage of that&#13;
program 10 times smaller in India), the income adjusted per member cost of EPFO is 7 times&#13;
larger, indicating potential inefficiencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                36&#13;
&amp;#12;In summary, all these measures are quite informative but should be used only with subsets&#13;
of comparable programs. We also note that there may be a progression in the usefulness&#13;
and applicability of various indices. Indices in (1), (2), and (3) may be more relevant when a&#13;
system is stable and mature. However, when administrative costs devour most revenues or&#13;
investment profits, such indices will not reveal much about the health of the program.&#13;
Rather, indices in (4), (9), or (10) would be more revealing.&#13;
&#13;
 VI.    Data Analysis and Cost Benchmarking&#13;
&#13;
We provide three alternative quantitative models for our analysis. We first investigate the&#13;
effects of program design on administrative expenditures (for example, private versus&#13;
public management). We then study factors explaining the differences in administrative&#13;
expenditures in managing pension liabilities. Finally, we proceed with benchmarking&#13;
analysis for individual programs.&#13;
&#13;
We account for the program size by using the information on the total number of members.&#13;
However, we track separately the active contributing or effectively insured members&#13;
(where the pension agency keeps corresponding records of such members in-house) and&#13;
the beneficiaries (including recipients of old-age, disability, survivors, work injury, and other&#13;
pensions as well as cash benefits like maternity, family, and child allowances). We find&#13;
significant differences in how total counts in these two groups affect total costs.&#13;
&#13;
To control for heteroscedasticity, all our quantitative variables are in natural logs.&#13;
Corresponding coefficients, therefore, indicate percentage change in the endogenous&#13;
variable as a result of the 100 percent increase in the explanatory variables.&#13;
&#13;
6. 1.   Administrative expenditures and program design&#13;
&#13;
The first data set is the most comprehensive and includes all observations of our sample,&#13;
including 116 publicly managed programs (see annex 1 and annex 2) and 12 additional&#13;
observations of the combined administrative charges of privately managed pension&#13;
programs.40&#13;
&#13;
The cost function is constructed as follows:&#13;
&#13;
ln EXP = a0 + a1 ln BEN + a2 ln INS + a3 DCSCHEME + a4 PRIVATEMGT + a5 COLLECTION&#13;
        + a6 SHUL + a7 BP + a8 ln GDPpc + a9 OUTLIERS + e,&#13;
&#13;
where EXP is the total operating expenses;41 BEN is the total number of beneficiaries&#13;
serviced by the program or agency;42 and INS is the total number of active contributors (or&#13;
&#13;
40&#13;
  Sources include Tapia and Yermo (2008) and FIAP statistics (http://www.fiap.cl).&#13;
41&#13;
  This definition treats expenditures of public programs and total charges imposed under mandatory private&#13;
schemes equally. It also includes all costs associated with asset management (in-house or outsourced).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    37&#13;
&amp;#12;insured). The five categorical variables are correspondingly for DC scheme; DC scheme&#13;
managed by private agency(ies); schemes where contribution collection is operated largely&#13;
in-house; schemes with additional benefits (sickness, health insurance, unemployment&#13;
insurance, or loans to members); and basic pension schemes (rank 1 in table 2). GDPpc is&#13;
the national income per capita to account for differences in technology and quality of&#13;
institutions.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, we define a group of programs that are outliers in terms of excessive costs per&#13;
member adjusted for income differences (see section 4.1); in all our regressions this&#13;
variable was highly significant. Table 5 contains the results.&#13;

                  Note: t-statistic in parentheses.&#13;
&#13;
Our first specification is simply to account for program size and income differences, while&#13;
the second specification introduces design elements and generates considerable additional&#13;
explanatory power. These are the key observations:&#13;
&#13;
42&#13;
  This generally includes old-age pensions, disability pensions, survivorâ&#128;&#153;s pensions, work-injury pensions,&#13;
other pension benefits, maternity (parental) allowances, family allowances, child allowances, and other&#13;
assistance and compensations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       38&#13;
&amp;#12;ï&#130;·   In line with other studies, we identify economies of scale as the coefficients by both the&#13;
    beneficiaries and insured are less than one. At the same time, confirming the&#13;
    observations of section 4.3, there are significant differences in the effects produced by&#13;
    beneficiaries versus contributors. This is consistent across all our specifications and&#13;
    subsets of data. There are significant differences in variable costs between two different&#13;
    lines of social security operations. We discuss this finding later in the text.&#13;
ï&#130;·   The results show the robust and significant effect of private management of pension&#13;
    plans. However, as we move to our long-term specifications, we find that the effect is&#13;
    not robust and may, in part, reflect differences in the maturity and coverage of the&#13;
    schemes in the shorter term.&#13;
ï&#130;·   The evidence of cost differentials between the DB and DC schemes is weak. In fact,&#13;
    substituting this variable with the categorical variable for fund management produces&#13;
    somewhat stronger results. This indicates that the mere fact of managing financial&#13;
    assets (in either DC or DB schemes) is associated with some additional costs, thereby&#13;
    reflecting a need for advanced skills and systems.&#13;
ï&#130;·   We expected that bringing the collection function in-house would increase costs.&#13;
    However, the results do not show robust evidence for such an increase. One possible&#13;
    explanation is that the modes of organizing the collection function vary significantly (see&#13;
    Anusic 2005), so capturing such a variation under one categorical variable constitutes a&#13;
    measurement challenge. We also note that as far as variable costs are concerned, the&#13;
    function of managing active contributors is not that impactful. Perhaps the collection&#13;
    function, however loosely defined, is a relatively small add-on in terms of variable costs.&#13;
    The conclusion is that the argument for consolidation of the collection function cannot&#13;
    be supported on the basis of cost reduction alone but rather on the basis of other&#13;
    systemic improvements (for example, reduced administrative burden, improved&#13;
    compliance, and overall improvements in economic efficiency due to reduced&#13;
    informality). This finding does not extend to start-up or other fixed costs. Where&#13;
    significant investments are required to establish or modernize a collection function,&#13;
    both tax and social security contributions systems could benefit from a well-coordinated&#13;
    effort.&#13;
ï&#130;·   Administrative costs increase less than proportionately with increases in income per&#13;
    capita. One possible explanation suggested by earlier studies is that more developed&#13;
    countries can manage pension schemes more efficiently, taking advantage of better&#13;
    technologies, infrastructure, and institutions (see Mitchell et al. 1993 and James and&#13;
    Palacios 1995).&#13;
ï&#130;·   In line with figure 3, plain basic pension schemes that do not require a history of&#13;
    contributions to establish eligibility are less expensive to manage. At the same time, we&#13;
    did not find robust evidence that schemes that serve the public sector only or means-&#13;
    tested pension programs are systematically less expensive on average. This can be in&#13;
    line with our earlier observation of the disproportional importance of the benefit-&#13;
    management function relative to contribution management. As long as the agency does&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              39&#13;
&amp;#12;     benefit calculations and payments, the costs of recordkeeping do not differ much across&#13;
     different program types.&#13;
&#13;
6. 2.   Administrative expenditures and pension liabilities&#13;
&#13;
We now construct a specification that would reveal the long-term effects of various design&#13;
factors on costs. We use a measure of pension liabilities and validate preliminary findings&#13;
from section 5. 2. To control for maturity and generosity biases, we introduce a measure of&#13;
the average member account value.43&#13;
&#13;
The cost function is constructed as follows:&#13;
&#13;
ln EXP = a0 + a1 ln LIABILITY+ a2 DCSCHEME + a3 PRIVATEMGT + a4 COLLECTION&#13;
        + a5 ln GDPpc + a6 ln ACCOUNT + a7 OUTLIERS + a8 GOV + a9 SHUL + e&#13;
&#13;
where EXP is the total operating expenses defined as in the previous equation; LIABILITY&#13;
equals the total reported assets of the DC schemes or an estimated Implicit Pension Debt&#13;
(IPD) for the DB schemes;44 the categorical variables are the same as in the previous&#13;
equation; ACCOUNT is the ratio of total DC assets or DB IPD over total members (to&#13;
approximate maturity); GOV is the government effectiveness index45.&#13;
&#13;
We use the same observations as in the previous regression; however, the sample is smaller&#13;
due to the limited data on the implicit pension debt of public programs. These are the same&#13;
observations as figure 6 illustrates. Table 6 contains the results.&#13;

   We define members as all contributors and beneficiaries for the DB schemes and as contributors only for&#13;
most DC schemes in our sample (recognizing that retiring members in most cases liquidate their balances at&#13;
the point of separation).&#13;

   Government effectiveness captures perceptions of the quality of public services, public administration,&#13;
public infrastructure, the quality of the civil service and the degree of its independence from political&#13;
pressures, the quality of policy formulation and implementation, and the credibility of the government's&#13;
commitment to such policies (World Bank 2012).&#13;

&#13;
At first look, our baseline specification reveals costs differences associated with our core set&#13;
of design elements. However, as we introduce the adjustment for maturity, the marginal&#13;
effects on costs of the scheme design become smaller and less significant. Here are some&#13;
more specific observations:&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   The value of the coefficient by pension liabilities (&lt;1) indicates economies of scale in&#13;
    management of pension liabilities. The larger, older, and more generous schemes tend&#13;
    to be less expensive to manage per unit of liability. However, effects of these three&#13;
    factors are not distinguishable here.&#13;
ï&#130;·   The DC schemes, private sector schemes (all DC in our sample), and schemes that&#13;
    operate a fund management function (not shown among these results) are all&#13;
    associated with a cost increment. However, the results are not robust and their&#13;
    significance depends on choice of specification. As the maturity indicator is added, the&#13;
    scheme design becomes a less significant explanation of the cost differentials. This may&#13;
    suggest that in the long run, design largely does not matter and the costs should not be&#13;
    the key driving factor in policy choices over a particular design type.&#13;
ï&#130;·   The sign of the coefficient of the average account size is as expected and suggests that&#13;
    unit costs decline as schemes mature. In the long run, this factor may compensate for&#13;
    the possibly higher overall management costs of the DC schemes, if the same account&#13;
    over time can generate greater value under the DC arrangements compared to implicit&#13;
    wealth generated under a DB scheme. So, the policy focus should be on the wealth-&#13;
    generating patterns of different types of schemes and not just on cost ratios.&#13;
ï&#130;·   This specification indicates that in-house collection of contributions is associated with&#13;
    higher administrative expenditures.&#13;
ï&#130;·   We find again that the value of the coefficient for national income per capita is positive&#13;
    but less than one, indicating that more developed countries may have better institutions&#13;
    and access to better technologies, and so can manage pension liabilities more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  41&#13;
&amp;#12;       efficiently. We also experimented with several governance indices and found that index&#13;
       that captures government effectiveness produces the most robust effects (specification&#13;
       [c] in table 6).46 Higher levels in that index are associated with lower administrative&#13;
       costs. Interestingly, as this index captures most of institutional factors, the response to&#13;
       changes in the levels of national income becomes close to one. These results seem to&#13;
       suggest that technologies as they spread over time become less important in explaining&#13;
       cost differences, and what ultimately matters is the quality of governance.&#13;
ï&#130;·      We also note that managing special supplementary programs and benefits produces&#13;
       increments in operating costs.&#13;
&#13;
6. 3.      Administrative expenditures and institutional organization&#13;
&#13;
We now proceed with the third and main model of our analysis, which we also use for&#13;
performance benchmarking of mandatory programs. The sample of programs used in the&#13;
regression contains only publicly operated programs and only those programs for which we&#13;
have information on staffing levels.&#13;
&#13;
We adopted a two-step approach. In the first step, we assess and benchmark technical&#13;
efficiency using the data on staffing levels. We then obtain residuals from this step as an&#13;
indication for over- or under-staffing and use them in the regression of the second step in&#13;
which we look at the cost efficiency of the same programs. In the final results, we can then&#13;
distinguish sources of deviations from the benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
Step I regression equation is constructed as follows:&#13;
&#13;
ln STAFF = a0 + a1 ln BEN [+ a2 (ln BEN)2] + a3 ln GDPpc + a4 COLLECTION + a5 SHUL + e,&#13;
&#13;
where the new variable is STAFF as the total number of staff in the agency.&#13;

           Note: t-statistic in parentheses.&#13;
&#13;
Remarkably, the number of beneficiaries (recipients of retirement benefits) alone explains&#13;
over 80 percent of the variation in the staffing levels. The level of the coefficient indicates&#13;
economies of scale. We experimented with several alternative specifications and found that&#13;
the number of the insured or contributors for whom records are kept in-house produced&#13;
only a small additional power, and the significance of its coefficient drops to almost zero&#13;
when we add various categorical variables. This may be due to the fact that the agencies do&#13;
not really provide direct service to contributors and largely interact with their employers, so&#13;
association with the contributor numbers is loose. Mere recordkeeping of the contributors&#13;
does not seem to significantly affect staffing requirements but contribution collection and&#13;
special additional services does, implying the importance of fixed costs over variable costs&#13;
for that line of business. We also found that design of the scheme (DC versus DB) or sectoral&#13;
affiliation (public only versus private sector) did not produce any systematic differences in&#13;
staffing requirements.&#13;
&#13;
In most regressions, we obtained slightly better fitting results when using a squared&#13;
function for beneficiaries. It may reflect the fact that the variable costs on top of significant&#13;
fixed costs are relatively indistinguishable for smaller plans, so the quadratic function&#13;
captures that aspect better. In our benchmarking we used quadratic functions in both&#13;
staffing requirements and administrative costs regressions.47&#13;
&#13;
An interesting observation can be made regarding the negative sign of the income per&#13;
capita coefficient in the staffing regression. It indicates that as economies develop and new&#13;
technologies become available, they tend to substitute capital for labor. This particularly&#13;
conforms to the case for the U.S. Social Security Administration depicted in figure 1.&#13;
&#13;
We obtained residuals from (c) and used them as STAFF_RES in the Step II regression:&#13;
&#13;
ln EXP_NAMC = a0 + a1 (ln BEN)2 + a2 (ln INS)2 + a3 ln GDPpc + a4 STAFF_RES&#13;
             + a5 COLLECTION + a6 SHUL + a7 FUNDSMNGMT + a8 OUTLIERS + e.&#13;
&#13;
The principal difference in this regression is that here we use the progra â&#128;&#153;s total operati g&#13;
expenses net of explicit direct costs associated with asset management, often external to&#13;
the administration (EXP_NAMC). Our reasoning was that practices of managing pension&#13;
&#13;
47&#13;
     We also observed that the coefficients of linear terms become insignificant in the quadratic specifications.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                            43&#13;
&amp;#12;assets vary substantially and so do the associated costs and norms of reporting those costs.&#13;
By taking out those costs, we focused on benchmarking only the core operation&#13;
mechanisms. We do admit, however, that total and clear segregation of those costs was not&#13;
possible in all cases.48 To capture various related costs, we added a categorical variable&#13;
FUNDMGT associated with the management of financial assets in either DC or DB schemes.&#13;

                 Note: t-statistic in parentheses.&#13;
&#13;
One of the most important and already familiar observations is a striking difference in the&#13;
coefficients by beneficiaries versus insured (specification [a]), which consistently reflects&#13;
across all our models and specifications (including linear and quadratic). This indicates that&#13;
the variable costs are much more important in the management of beneficiaries relative to&#13;
the management of contributor accounts. In other words, there are significant economies&#13;
of scale in managing active member accounts. Furthermore, variable costs become&#13;
insignificant when the categorical variable of in-house collection is added. These findings&#13;
have interesting implications for the policy of collection administration. Specifically, as&#13;
significant capital investments have been made in the collection function, transferring that&#13;
function to an external agency, such as tax administration, may not be a significant cost&#13;
&#13;
48&#13;
   In most such cases, investment management remains largely in-house and is often restricted to passive,&#13;
limited, or illiquid portfolios, including public debt and real estate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     44&#13;
&amp;#12;saver. Hence, if the capacity of an external collection agency is weak, the advantage of such&#13;
outsourcing may be questionable. At the same time, significant up-front cost-saving&#13;
advantages could be seized if new schemes can rely on the existing collection infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
On the beneficiary side, given significant variable costs, there may be considerable&#13;
economies of scope, which may argue in favor of consolidating various benefit programs&#13;
under a unified administration (for example, universal basic pensions and earnings-related&#13;
pensions or retirement benefits and various short-term or other special benefits, especially&#13;
where these mostly cover the same groups of beneficiaries).&#13;
&#13;
The significance of the coefficients by GDPpc and by the residual from the staffing&#13;
regression again suggests that more developed countries can operate their schemes more&#13;
efficiently and that a significant part of variation in costs can be explained by the deviation&#13;
of staffing levels from projected benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
Additional services to active members (benefits of sickness, health, unemployment, or&#13;
individual loans) increase the total costs. The significance of the coefficient by funds&#13;
management may capture two aspects: (a) the additional costs of managing pension assets&#13;
that cannot be distinguished from the total costs are important, and (b) even if costed out&#13;
separately, such functions may be associated with a cost premium, for example, for higher&#13;
skilled staff.&#13;
&#13;
6. 4.   Performance against benchmarks&#13;
&#13;
Annex 3 contains the results of our benchmarking analysis, providing actual and fitted&#13;
estimates for both staffing and total administrative expenditures. It also provides&#13;
benchmark coefficients: where such coefficients are close to 1, the program operates at its&#13;
benchmark.&#13;
&#13;
While we ran regressions only for 99 observations where we had full information on staffing&#13;
levels, our methodology allows for producing expenditure benchmarks for the programs&#13;
outside of that sample. We treated two specific parameters as anomalies: (a) deviations&#13;
from projected staffing levels and (b) outliers with excessive administrative expenditures.&#13;
To benchmark the expenditures, we turned both parameters to zero. Effectively, our&#13;
expenditure benchmarks assume the benchmark performance on the staffing side. Where&#13;
we have information on the actual staffing levels for particular programs, such information&#13;
provides additional insight into program performance. Where such additional information is&#13;
not available, the benchmark ratio simply indicates how the program performs relative to&#13;
the cost benchmark and given staffing performance just at the benchmark. We will illustrate&#13;
further how to interpret these results.&#13;
&#13;
We further group programs in three categories. Category A is for progra s that perfor&#13;
at the benchmark. Expenditure coefficients for this group are within the range of plus and&#13;
minus 25 percent of the benchmark to allow for measurement errors and minor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              45&#13;
&amp;#12;inefficiencies. Around 30 percent of the programs in our sample are in this category for the&#13;
total expenditure performance.&#13;
&#13;
Categor B is for progra s that de iate fro the e h ark e o d               per e t ut ot&#13;
exceeding 100 percent. This may indicate moderate inefficiencies of under- or over-&#13;
resourcing in either staff or other expenditures. Around 50 percent of the programs in our&#13;
sample fall under this category and may merit further inquiries into potential operational&#13;
optimization.&#13;
&#13;
Programs where performance coefficients are more than double the predicted levels are in&#13;
 ategor C . Most of them are suspects for operational inefficiencies, especially those&#13;
where benchmark coefficients are multiples of the predicted levels. Out of the eleven&#13;
programs where the expenditure-to-benchmark ratio exceeds 5, eight are located in Sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa. In the cases of Uganda, Kenya, and Ghana the expenditure coefficients are&#13;
26, 15, and 11, respectively. It may be easy to overspend when operating significant&#13;
surpluses, which all three happen to have, but excessive costs certainly cannot be&#13;
affordable as schemes mature.&#13;
&#13;
Where we have information on the staffing levels, we can define several categories in terms&#13;
of how staffing affects overall expenditure outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
ï&#130;·   There is a AA ategor of progra s i           hi h oth staffi g a d e pe ditures are at&#13;
    the benchmark (13 programs in our sample).&#13;
ï&#130;·   Where both staffing and expenditure benchmarks are on the higher side, it indicates&#13;
    that osts are ai l dri e          e essi e staffi g. There are     progra s i the CC&#13;
    category. In the cases of Norway and U.K.-Northern Ireland, both staffing and&#13;
    expenditure ratios are of the same magnitude (around 5 and 3, respectively), indicating&#13;
    that staffing is a key driving factor behind the higher levels of administrative&#13;
    expenditures. We do note, however, that findings of excessive costs for some European&#13;
    agencies, including in Norway, Ireland, and U.K.-Northern Ireland, should be taken in the&#13;
    context of operating multiple programs, including active labor market programs and&#13;
    various targeted welfare schemes, which our analysis cannot fully capture. The same is&#13;
    true for the U.S. SSA that has targeting costs to consider. The Canadian public sector&#13;
    plan falls into this category perhaps due to the additional services it provides to&#13;
    employers outside of the government, requiring a more extensive compliance&#13;
    enforcement effort, even though we have classified its collection effort as insignificant&#13;
    compared to conventional private sector plans. Uganda is an interesting case; in 2008,&#13;
    the NSSF embarked on the mission to decentralize its operation, and by 2009 the agency&#13;
    had 4 times the predicted requirements for staffing. The decentralization never took full&#13;
    effect, but it subsequently was found that many staff were underutilized and roles&#13;
    duplicated. Thus, a decision was made to downsize and release close to 40 percent of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             46&#13;
&amp;#12;     the staff,49 which would be in line with recommendations of our analysis but still far&#13;
     from the benchmark performance.&#13;
ï&#130;·    At the lower e d of resour e o        it e t is the BB ategor . We fi d, for e a ple,&#13;
     that the DC schemes in Denmark, the Maldives, and Singapore, operate with very low&#13;
     demand on both labor and other resources when the costs of asset management are&#13;
     excluded, which may reflect efficient operation. At the same time, there are low-end&#13;
     resource-commitment programs like the public sector pension scheme in Afghanistan,&#13;
     which is a candidate for suboptimal operation. While serving beneficiaries across&#13;
     Afghanistan, the operation is concentrated in the capital city, where 90 percent of&#13;
     beneficiaries have to travel in order to get service. Additionally, payments are made&#13;
     only once a year. Clearly, low costs come with poor service here.&#13;
ï&#130;·    There is a group of programs in which expenditures are excessive while staffing levels&#13;
     are at or below the benchmark. For example, Burkina Faso and Tanzania (PPF) are in the&#13;
      C ategor for e pe diture, a d those also happe to e flagged a s outliers in our&#13;
     regressions. An important point to note is that their staffing levels are on the low side.&#13;
     We made additional investigation into the overall costs of labor. For the observations&#13;
     where we had separately reported labor costs, we calculated the ratios of those costs&#13;
     per staff numbers and adjusted by GDP per capita. We then calculated the median&#13;
      alues of that i de for e pe diture oeffi ie t ategories B-lo , A , B-high , and&#13;
      C a d those stood at . , . , . , a d . , respectively. This implies that those&#13;
     programs that overspend have a tendency to pay premiums relative to the rest of the&#13;
     economy to their staff.&#13;
ï&#130;·    Finally, there are programs in which total expenses against the benchmark are on the&#13;
     low side while staffing is at or above the benchmark. The most notable cases are the Sri&#13;
     Lankan Farmers Pension Scheme and the Syrian GOSI. It seems that those programs&#13;
     retain inexpensive labor, possibly lack investments in technology and infrastructure, and&#13;
     operate suboptimally in terms of resource allocation between labor and capital.&#13;
&#13;
6. 5.   Implications for choice of cost indices&#13;
&#13;
Our analysis leaves many programs outside the scope of the benchmarking exercise.&#13;
However, it can offer guidance on the ultimate choice of a simple index that makes cost&#13;
comparisons meaningful. The following table provides estimates of correlation between our&#13;
expenditure benchmark ratios and a set of conventional cost indices that are discussed in&#13;
section 5.&#13;

&#13;
The results broadly reflect our earlier discussion of biases associated with various indices.&#13;
Expenditure over GDP is not a good predictor of program health. Using program revenues&#13;
or benefit expenditures does not produce sufficient explanatory power either. Using the&#13;
combined total number of insured and beneficiaries and adjusting for differences in&#13;
incomes provides better results among the commonly used indices. Apparently, even better&#13;
results can be achieved by using just the number of beneficiaries in the denominator. This&#13;
should not be surprising as our regressions show disproportionate importance of the&#13;
numbers of beneficiaries compared to the insured in explaining the cost differences.&#13;
&#13;
6. 6.   Global benchmarks&#13;
&#13;
To further guide inquiries into the cost indices analysis, we generated a set of benchmarks&#13;
on the basis of our model. Annex 4 provides a set of just-on-benchmark estimates of the&#13;
index of Administrative Expenditures over Beneficiaries for different program sizes and&#13;
different levels of national income. The direct costs of asset management, if any, are&#13;
excluded. We provide estimates for five stylized country income categories (GDP per capita&#13;
in current US$ indicated): low income (LI: US$500); lower-middle income (LMI: US$2,500);&#13;
upper-middle income (UMI: US$8,000); lower-high income (LHI: US$15,000); and upper-&#13;
high income (UHI: US$40,000). In each case, we provide 5 schedules: a baseline low&#13;
estimate; three estimates which correspondingly are the functions of in-house collection,&#13;
fund management, and special supplementary schemes assessed individually; and a high&#13;
cost estimate in which all three functions are combined.&#13;
&#13;
Results indicate that with differences in functional organization and services, the spread&#13;
between the high and low estimates is almost fourfold. With such a broad benchmark, we&#13;
are cautioned against providing advice on the appropriate level of expenditures for a&#13;
particular program without detailed inquiry into its operational organization.&#13;
&#13;
We also observe the same schedule of economies of scale across all stylized cases.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 9 depicts such a schedule as a proportion of a midsize plan with 500,000&#13;
beneficiaries.&#13;

       Note: Per-beneficiary costs relative to per-beneficiary costs of a plan with 500,000 beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
For plans with 100,000 beneficiaries, the premium for their smaller size is 50 percent over&#13;
the costs of similar plans with 500,000 beneficiaries. Similarly, larger-sized plans could be 25&#13;
percent less expensive (per beneficiary) to manage. One particular application of this&#13;
schedule could be the planning of consolidation programs.&#13;
&#13;
This schedule can also be helpful in more flexible benchmarking of program costs. Figure 10&#13;
depicts low and high scenarios for per-beneficiary costs of a program with 500,000&#13;
beneficiaries for different levels of GDP per capita. As our regression coefficients indicate,&#13;
costs increase less then proportionally with increases in income levels.&#13;
&#13;
To illustrate applicability of this method, let us assess the benchmark spread of&#13;
expenditures for a plan with 100,000 members in an economy of US$15,000 GDP per capita.&#13;
First, we use from figure 10 the spread for the 500,000 plan, which is US$50â&#128;&#147;200. Then&#13;
from figure 9, we find that the size premium for a 100,000 plan is approximately 50 percent.&#13;
This means that the benchmark spread we are looking for is US$75 â&#128;&#147;300.&#13;

We also developed similar benchmark schedules for staffing levels. For the convenience of&#13;
application, we provided workload schedules in which beneficiaries are in the numerator.&#13;
Figure 11 indicates economies of scale in staffing requirements to manage programs of&#13;
different sizes.&#13;

&amp;#12;Interpretation of results is similar to the one provided for the costs schedule. Plans with&#13;
100,000 beneficiaries require approximately 30 percent more staff per beneficiary&#13;
compared to the same type of plan with 500,000 beneficiaries. At the same time, the larger-&#13;
sized schemes require 30 percent less of human resources per beneficiary.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 12 depicts low and high scenarios for the workload ratios of a program with 500,000&#13;
beneficiaries for different levels of GDP per capita. As our regression coefficients indicate in&#13;
table 7, staffing requirements per beneficiary actually decline with increases in income&#13;
levels (the reverse of that relationship is presented in the workload schedule). The variation&#13;
between the low and high scenarios is defined by adding functions of in-house contribution&#13;
collection and provision of special schemes, which we found statistically significant in&#13;
explaining cost differences. Note that the curve on top indicates the results of the low&#13;
resource requirement, and the curve at the bottom is the high resource estimate (with both&#13;
of these additional functions factored in). It is important to emphasize again the wide&#13;
spread in the benchmark, which is threefold between the low and high estimates. Hence,&#13;
any recommendations on staffing levels should be carefully crafted with incorporating&#13;
information on the nature of operational organization or services a particular agency&#13;
provides.&#13;

&amp;#12;VII.   Quality Aspects in Cost Measurement: What is Left to Residual&#13;
&#13;
In this section we discuss the implications of not having full data on the nature and quality&#13;
of services for our results. Service quality comes at a cost. Higher operational expenses may&#13;
reflect better services (for example, more frequent and direct communications with clients,&#13;
faster processing of benefit claims, and more inclusive payment methods). Unfortunately,&#13;
differences in the nature of particular bundles of service or variation in their quality remain&#13;
uncaptured. Hence, we need to interpret our results and recommendations on&#13;
benchmarking with caution. Figure 13 illustrates the limitations of our analysis.&#13;

&#13;
This diagram introduces an additional dimension to our multivariate regression and&#13;
effectively collapses our regression line into one single point, A . Assuming that there is a&#13;
relationship between the costs and quality of services offered, our regression generates an&#13;
average cost estimate around an average bundle of services that are of average quality.&#13;
Thus, if our assessment finds that a particular scheme operates just at its benchmark, it&#13;
corresponds to line M in the diagram. However, it does not necessarily imply that the&#13;
scheme offers services at an efficient level. In fact, given the cost, the scheme can offer a&#13;
service bundle that would place it to the left of poi t A , which is a suboptimal cost and&#13;
quality combination. Or it can offer exceptional services, which would put it on the far right&#13;
of poi t A , implying an efficiency premium in such a system. So, on-the-benchmark results&#13;
of our simulations can only be taken to imply equal probabilities of over- and under-&#13;
efficient operation.&#13;
&#13;
However, if the osts e eed our e h ark, it puts su h a s ste o li e H, hi h ea s&#13;
that ith the opti al operatio     arked poi t B there o is a greater pro a ilit that&#13;
the system operates sub-efficiently. Finally, with the estimate below the benchmark, we are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              52&#13;
&amp;#12; o o li e L, a d so, there is a higher pro a ilit that the s ste                      osts less tha the&#13;
average cost estimate of the same bundle of services would suggest.&#13;
&#13;
In summary, the tools of conventional analysis with narrow sets of explanatory variables&#13;
can only produce very limited inferences about the performance of various programs. In&#13;
each case, we need to look beyond our results. Special operational and beneficiary surveys&#13;
could help capture information on the performance and satisfaction of various stakeholders&#13;
with program administration, including processing times, compliance costs and various&#13;
overheads, and overall perception of service quality. At the same time, our methodology&#13;
and findings help point in the direction of such additional inquiries.&#13;
&#13;
Furthermore, it is difficult to establish a clear association between the costs and value of&#13;
service, even in theory, to support any assumption about the shape of the cost line in figure&#13;
13. Even if we could define distinct bundles of services, ranking of their social preferences&#13;
and hence, value for society would not be straightforward. While it is beyond the scope of&#13;
this paper, we can take a brief look at this challenge. For example, in the context of a DC&#13;
plan where individuals may have a choice of an investment option, let us consider three&#13;
alternative operational arrangements: (1) there are three investment options with switching&#13;
allowed once a month, (2) there are five investment options but with switching allowed no&#13;
more than twice a year, and (3) there is only one default investment portfolio. Perhaps both&#13;
(1) and (2) are superior to (3) but choosing a superior solution between (1) and (2) is not&#13;
clear-cut. In fact, on a society utility plateau, (1) and (2) may be equally preferable but the&#13;
costs may considerably and systematically differ. So, it would be difficult to establish a clear&#13;
association between the costs and values (quality) of services in this case.50&#13;
&#13;
Thus, the gap in accounting for the variation in service value and quality in the operation of&#13;
mandatory social security programs limits conclusiveness of our benchmarking analysis.&#13;
&#13;
VIII.   Conclusions&#13;
&#13;
As countries develop and seek to provide coverage to greater segments of their population,&#13;
administrative costs become an important aspect of reforms, especially where new&#13;
mandate extends to low-income or informal-sector workers. New technologies pave the&#13;
way for effective outreach, monitoring, and recordkeeping, while infrastructure&#13;
improvements (including financial services) provide for better access.&#13;
&#13;
Comparing and benchmarking administrative expenditures helps assess the efficiency of&#13;
different modes of operational organization of public social security programs. It provides&#13;
guidance on reform strategy, choice of alternative organizational models, and trade-offs in&#13;
&#13;
50&#13;
  We also note that all quality improvements with their additional investment costs exhibit diminishing&#13;
returns. While (3) is one extreme of the spectrum, at the other end of the same spectrum, we may have an&#13;
unlimited number of options with unlimited switching allowed and all instantly available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    53&#13;
&amp;#12;instituting various new operational elements. Inquiries into operational efficiency often&#13;
prompt complex organizational transformations. Among trend-setting practices are cutting&#13;
redundant staff, employing more advanced technologies, sharing certain functions with&#13;
other public entities, and outsourcing select tasks to other agencies. To decide on optimal&#13;
investments in systems, processes, and people, it is important to understand the key factors&#13;
that affect the costs of operating various schemes.&#13;
&#13;
First, it is important to recognize economies of scale and scope in managing social security&#13;
programs, including their magnitudes in contribution collection and benefit management.&#13;
Synergies with existing mechanisms should always be sought. Private management of the&#13;
schemes will be more expensive compared to the public option but differences may&#13;
disappear over the long term. At the same time, funding of pension liabilities (in either DB&#13;
or DC schemes) will always involve cost premium, given advanced complementary resource&#13;
requirements. These considerations will involve important policy decisions. Finally, the level&#13;
of economic development has a strong impact on costs, suggesting that more developed&#13;
countries can manage social security schemes more efficiently, possibly taking advantage of&#13;
better technologies, infrastructure, and institutions. As technologies spread over time, they&#13;
may become less important in explaining cost differentials. Yet, quality of governance&#13;
seems to remain an important indicator of the financial health of any program in both the&#13;
short and long run.&#13;

&amp;#12;Abstract&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This study provides a framework for comparison and benchmarking of administrative expenditures&#13;
of public and private social security programs. The paper presents the genesis of the inquiries&#13;
into the subject, reviewing some of the most relevant literature on administrative expenditures&#13;
and the costs of mandatory programs produced over the past two decades. The quantitative&#13;
analysis builds on the extensive body of literature, but our framework evolved considerably&#13;
from earlier studies. Our dataset includes over 100 observations and a broad set of explanatory&#13;
variables. We developed and compared a number of standardized cost indices discussing their&#13;
advantages and limitations. We also discuss major cost components and their shares in total&#13;
program costs. The analysis explains over 90 percent of variation in administrative expenditures.&#13;
It confirms some of the hypotheses expressed in the earlier studies and presents new evidence&#13;
of driving factors for costs. We developed three different specifications for statistical analysis.&#13;
The first set looks at the impact of design of a program on total costs. The second group of&#13;
specifications assesses differences in costs of managing pension liabilities between the public&#13;
and private mandatory pension schemes. Finally, on the basis of the third model we generate&#13;
benchmarks for staffing levels and for the total administrative expenditures. We compare those&#13;
to the actual indicators and develop standard performance ratios, providing insights into design&#13;
variations and performance of the programs. We conclude with a discussion of data limitations&#13;
and implications of our findings.&#13;
