Global Scaling Up Sanitation is a Water and Sanitation&#13;
Program (WSP) project focused on learning how to combine&#13;
the promising approaches of Community-Led Total Sanitation&#13;
and Sanitation Marketing to generate sanitation demand and&#13;
strengthen the supply of sanitation products and services at&#13;
scale, leading to improved health for people in rural areas.&#13;
It is a large-scale effort to meet the basic sanitation needs&#13;
of the rural poor who do not currently have access to safe&#13;
and hygienic sanitation. For more information, please visit&#13;

            beginning of the final year of implementation of the Global
            Scaling up Sanitation Project (TSSM) in India, Indonesia,
            and Tanzania, countries where the project is currently
            implemented. The project expects to meet or exceed global
            targets for the number of people having gained access to
            improved sanitation or have claimed open-defecation free
            (ODF) status. As of December 31, 2009 an estimated 6.5
            million people or 147 percent of the global end of project
            (EOP) target have either been verified by their respective
            national or local government verification systems as having
            gained access to improved sanitation (2.1 million) or have
            claimed ODF (4.4 million people). A total of just under
            4,000 communities have either been verified ODF (1,700
            communities or 60 percent EOP target) or have claimed ODF
            and are awaiting verification (2,250 communities or 80
            percent EOP target).
