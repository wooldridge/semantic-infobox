&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur, The World Bank:&#13;
Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press, 1997. It is not a formal&#13;
oral history, and it is not a systematic overview of the work of the person interviewed. At times&#13;
the authors discussed the planned publication itself and the sources that should be consulted; at&#13;
other times they talked about persons and publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview&#13;
tapes and transcripts begin and end abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives&#13;
believes that this transcript may be of interest to researchers and makes it available for public&#13;
use.&#13;

&#13;
[Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: There is a quite substantial difference between the privileges and immunities that&#13;
the ADB [Asian Development Bank] 1 enjoys from the headquarters government from what the&#13;
World Bank and IMF [International Monetary Fund] enjoy. As far as the sort of protection from&#13;
arrest and so on, that kind of immunity in the course of your official work is concerned, that is&#13;
common to all international institutions, and that's sort of a basic cornerstone of any headquarters&#13;
agreement. But in addition to that, we have in the headquarters agreement Section 44, which&#13;
gives a different kind of, almost a kind of, you might say, full diplomatic status to the president,&#13;
vice presidents, directors, alternate directors, and department heads. Now, this is quite a large&#13;
number. We figure in the diplomatic list. We have diplomatic number plates, you know, the four-&#13;
digit diplomatic number plates, we have full exemption from import duties. In fact, if one is&#13;
prepared to take the trouble, one is even exempt from paying the tax on one's electricity bills. I'm&#13;
not trying to get [inaudible] but that kind of thing. Now, also even the Section 45 personnel,&#13;
which are the rest of the professional staff, get duty-free gasoline, for instance, in the Bank's own&#13;
premises. Before we had our own gas station, one could fill up at any gas station and then send in&#13;
the bills for refund of the tax element. We hadâ&#128;&#148;I mean, Section 45 personnel had somewhat&#13;
limited but quite liberal import privileges for duty-free liquor, also a duty-free and tax-free car&#13;
every three years. So these are quite significant benefits.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It also must help you in your travel, your access to people . . .&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It's a big part of your . . .&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: That's right. So we do have, in personal terms, very substantial privileges and&#13;
immunities from the headquarters agreement.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yes. I don't think the personnel in the Inter-American Development Bank . . .&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: No, I don't think--in Washington certainly they don't.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Nor do the Bank . . .&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: No, the Bank and Fund definitely does not. I mean, I remember when my father&#13;
was executive director on the IMF. He had no diplomatic privileges or immunities of any kind. I&#13;
mean, as I said, except in the course of his work, thatâ&#128;&#153;s different. And then when he had a&#13;
corresponding rank of minister in the Indian Embassy, then as a virtue of that he had diplomatic&#13;
privileges, but not from the IMF. Under the IMF or the World Bank people do not enjoy&#13;
diplomatic privileges. Perhaps the managing director and the president may, I don't know. But&#13;

                                              Arun Adarkar&#13;
                                      November 27, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                       3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
certainly not the executive directors, whereas here . . .&#13;
&#13;
And we have another agreement with the Philippine government which is not recorded in the&#13;
headquarters agreement, but it's there on paper, and that again is fairly significant. Directors and&#13;
alternate directors are given the same rank as heads of mission for purposes of car importation,&#13;
which means that they are allowed to import two duty-free cars. And they get, for instance, an&#13;
airport access identity card which says â&#128;&#156;head of mission.â&#128;? So there are those kinds of privileges&#13;
and immunities which is somewhat different from what the World Bank enjoys.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I would suspect that you must need to have this kind of appeal to attract people from&#13;
some of the countries, at least, some of your member countries.&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Correct. And also, I think, it is to some extent a feature of being in a developing&#13;
country. I think that's a fairly important distinction. We were really the first and even to this day&#13;
one of the very few major institutions located in a developing country. Most of the U.N.&#13;
agencies are in developed countries except, you know, the new ones like UNEP [United Nations&#13;
Environment Program] which is in Nairobi. But even IFAD [International Fund for Agricultural&#13;
Development] , which is a fairly new international agency, was based on Rome. So most&#13;
development agencies are in developed countries, but we were a major one set up in a&#13;
developing country and therefore I think we got a somewhat more generous headquarters&#13;
agreement from the Philippines government.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It's a terrible shame that the Inter-American Bank [inaudible] speaking as a Peruvian&#13;
now. Do you have anything like quotas in your hiring?&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: We don't have formal quotas in our hiring, but again apropos the Philippines there&#13;
is a sort of understanding that our supporting staff will all be Filipinos. There are, of course,&#13;
some exceptions like a few directors like the Chinese director who because his language has an&#13;
assistant, that is, you know, a secretary, from China, in addition to a directorâ&#128;&#153;s assistant. The&#13;
Indian director also has a secretary from India. The Korean has a secretary from Korea. So--but&#13;
there are only these three. Otherwise the entire supporting staff is Filipino.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Oh, that's very different from the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: That's right. Now that's another big difference, whereas the World Bank hires its&#13;
supporting staff internationally. So that's a big difference there.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You've been with the Bank . . .&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Seventeen years this month.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Seventeen years. You've seen it grow from . . .&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Yes, when I joined the staff was, the professional staff was 200, and it is now over&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Arun Adarkar&#13;
                                 November 27, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
650. Supporting staff is roughly [inaudible] when we came the supporting staff was about 200 or&#13;
something.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: All along you must have intense contact with the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: We do, we have, especially on the operational side. We have very close contacts&#13;
because our working procedures are almost identical. In the board, on the operational side in loan&#13;
processing, our procedures are almost identical. Now, I do use the word "almost" because there&#13;
are certain differences. For instance, our project processing cycle is much shorter than that of the&#13;
World Bank. This is because we do take what some people regard as undesirable shortcuts, but&#13;
we think that we are doing the right thing. For instance, we often present a loan proposal to the&#13;
board before the detailed engineering, which means that you then have a somewhat bigger price&#13;
contingency because your price estimates, your cost estimates would really be determined firmly&#13;
only after you put out tenders. Now, in the case of the World Bank, they donâ&#128;&#153;t, I think, never--&#13;
they never go to the board with a loan proposal until the detailed engineering is complete and&#13;
you have fairly firm cost estimates, so as a result of which the normal project processing cycle in&#13;
the World Bank is about two years. In our case it can be as short as six to eight months. We have&#13;
actually done emergency loans in three months, but for a normal loan our project processing&#13;
cycle could be as little as six to eight months. It could go up to twelve months if one is not in a&#13;
great hurry. But this particular aspect, that we don't necessarily compete detailed engineering--&#13;
sometimes we do [inaudible] does help us to speed up our project processing cycle.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I believe--I'm not sure I'm right--that your tender rules, procedures differ from the&#13;
World Bank, is that right?&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: No, our guidelines for procurement and for engagement of consultants are very&#13;
similar to those of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Do you use two-envelope procedures?&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: We do use a two-envelope procedure, but yes, there are some differences there. I&#13;
wouldn't know the exact details; there are some differences there. But I think . . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: We were just talking to some of [inaudible] .&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Very interesting.&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Yes, but there are also differences in the domestic procurement policy. I think the&#13;
World Bank has 63 percent domestic preference. I think we have a slightly different system of&#13;
domestic preference and I wouldn't be able to give you those details because I've been out of&#13;
operations for some years now.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Arun Adarkar&#13;
                                November 27, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: We can check that out.&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: You can check that out.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In terms of procedures for disbursement and so on?&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Those are very similar.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Does this make a difference--I guess now the ADB [Asian Development Bank] has, as&#13;
the World Bank, uses co-financing?&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: No, it doesn't really make that much difference.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Does the fact that the procedures are reasonably identical makes the co-financing&#13;
perhaps better than if you do it with bilaterals where the procedures are, certainly are, apparently&#13;
different?&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: But, you see, what happens in co-financing is that, you are read--let's say it's a&#13;
$300 million project, for the sake of argument. Let's say the ADB is putting in $100 million; the&#13;
World Bank is putting in $200. It's very rare--I think almost never--that you have a turnkey&#13;
contract for the entire project. What's going to happen is you're going to have different project&#13;
components, and in practice thereâ&#128;&#153;s rarely going to be one contract that's going to be financed by&#13;
both. So you are in reality identifying components and contracts and saying X will be financed&#13;
by the ADB, Y by the World Bank. There's another reason for this, quite apart. Even if our&#13;
procedures were identical, you would come up against insurmountable problems if you had the&#13;
same contract being financed by both because the question of eligibility, source eligibility,&#13;
comes in. Our membership is different from that of the World Bank. So the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s, the&#13;
list of their countries eligible to bid, would be quite different from ours.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: On the other hand even if you have very different components of finance agencies,&#13;
from the point of view of the project executing agencies, the locals, the fact that bidding and&#13;
procurement procedures are similar, the accounting is . . .&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: It helps, it certainly helps. And as far as consultants are concerned, we have now a&#13;
common computer system so that a consultant, if he registers with us, doesn't have to register&#13;
separately with the World Bank and vice versa. So that, that also helps.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Oh, this has been on forever. But there is again one major operational difference&#13;
which is in a sense indirectly related to the project processing cycle. We provide technical&#13;
assistance for feasibility studies or even detailed engineering on a grant basis. The World Bank&#13;
has no grant technical assistance. They only provide technical assistance loans. Now, that makes&#13;
a very big difference. What we do is that we provide technical assistance on a grant basis with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Arun Adarkar&#13;
                                November 27, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the proviso that if a loan results from that [inaudible] , then the amount over, say, 250&#13;
thousandâ&#128;&#148;I mean, thatâ&#128;&#153;s the current limit--would then be incorporated in the loan. But the&#13;
World Bank has no grant facility at all for technical assistance. If a grant has to be given, then it's&#13;
usually given by the UNDP [United Nations Development Programme] , and then the World&#13;
Bank becomes an executing agency for that technical assistance. But we provide very substantial&#13;
technical assistance on the ground.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Do you see these similarities getting greater over time or on the contrary do you find&#13;
them developing in a different direction in terms of procedures?&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: In terms of procedures I think they're likely to become more and more similar&#13;
over time because basically the donor pool is the same. Our donor countries are the same as the&#13;
World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s donor countries, minus one or two [inaudible] but basically the donor pool is the&#13;
same. So it's very unlikely that Australia is agreeable to something in the World Bank but not in&#13;
the ADB. So in that sense the procedures, certainly board procedures and so on, are likely to go&#13;
along the same tracks and possibly move towards convergence rather than the opposite.&#13;
&#13;
However, I think this comes to the fundamental question, which at some stage you have to&#13;
address, of why a regional bank . . . [Words here drowned out by ringing telephone. A pause&#13;
follows, apparently for a telephone call.]&#13;
&#13;
So, you see, that comes to the question of why the regional banks, if the procedures are the same,&#13;
the lending modalities are similar, why do you need a regional bank? And this&#13;
is where I think you have to recognize the differences, that (a) we are in the region; we are much&#13;
closer to our borrowing countries; there are certain areas in which we can meet the need over the&#13;
World Bank. Now, this aspect of technical assistance that I mentioned, for instance, the fact that&#13;
we can give a grant for technical assistance means that we give it to the member, to the country&#13;
or to the government--it doesn't matter--whereas, when you're giving a loan, you have to be very&#13;
careful as to who you're giving it to because the loan has to come back.&#13;
&#13;
Now, take the case of Cambodia. We already have a mission in Cambodia because, again,&#13;
obviously I think any kind of operations in Cambodia would have to be preceded by technical&#13;
assistance, either to develop an accounting system or to even develop procedures and so on&#13;
because that's one area where the government, whatever Norodom Sihanouk has, would be&#13;
starting from absolute scratch after total isolation from the world for 14 years or whatever. Now,&#13;
we can give that technical assistance right away, whereas the World Bank would have to look&#13;
very closely. And I believe that that's where they're constrained: do we have a government in&#13;
Cambodia? Because it's loans. Now, if you're giving a loan, you have to protect the Bank's&#13;
interest in terms of repayment. If you are giving a grant, you don't have to care, I mean, whether&#13;
it's Norodom Sihanouk's government or what because the money is gone anyway; it's not going&#13;
to come back. So all we have to see is whether it can be properly implemented.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: These grants funds are in your normal . . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         Arun Adarkar&#13;
                                 November 27, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Theyâ&#128;&#153;re different. Yes, they are our normal resources, but . . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: There's no part of soft money there.&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: No. In the last soft funds replenishment there was an allocation to the TASF,&#13;
which is the Technical Assistance Special Fund. So our technical assistance grants are financed&#13;
either from the Technical Assistance Special Fund, which is made up of--there is also a two&#13;
percent, I think, OCR income, ordinary capital resources income, which goes to the Technical&#13;
Assistance Special Fund. There is an allocation from the Asian Development Fund. Now, the&#13;
arrangement for the next replenishment is about to be finalized so I don't know. One wouldn't&#13;
like to say as to what will happen to that one. Plus there are voluntary contributions to the&#13;
Technical Assistance Special Fund from--even from the developing countries like Indonesia,&#13;
Pakistan, India, and so on. And in addition to the TASF we have the Japan Special Fund, which&#13;
is provided by Japan, all grant financing of technical assistance. That would be similar to the&#13;
Cooperation Fund, say, Taiwan has provided ten million recently to the European Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development, so it would be similar to that. So the TA, the technical&#13;
assistance, is financed either by the TASF or by the JSF.&#13;
&#13;
There are also cases where the technical assistance is financed under cooperative arrangements&#13;
with various European bilateral donors like France, Norway, Switzerland. These are a few&#13;
examples that come to mind. There may be others, but there are technical . . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That's really quite a variety of sources.&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Both the general income and the replenishment and more . . .&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: And contributions, bilateral contributions, to the TASF, plus financing from other&#13;
bilateral sources. And then, of course, in addition to that there is UNDP financing for which the&#13;
Bank acts as an executing agency.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: One might argue that if [inaudible] frequently the Bank for stability of having&#13;
[inaudible] and in fact they have now started to get into that [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: The World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yes, but [inaudible] is a procedure basically, something which they can do, you&#13;
know. And, if they do it, then one of the major differences between the regional banks and the&#13;
World Bank would seem to be [inaudible] . On the other hand, if you look at, both in terms of&#13;
what sorts of projects you finance, sectors, as well as a sort of development philosophy, thereâ&#128;&#153;s a&#13;
perhaps more East Asia dominated philosophy, the World Bank a more U.S. philosophy, or if&#13;
you also see in terms of--well, if you just see in terms of sectors . . .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                November 27, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Well, I, no, I don't see it in terms of East Asian as against U.S.-dominated&#13;
philosophy. I think the development philosophy is basically similar. I see more in terms of&#13;
complementarity, which again derives from the respective sizes of the institutions. For instance,&#13;
the World Bank provides structural adjustment lending which for sheer volume I don't think this&#13;
bank would really take on--and there's no need to take on. We would wish to avoid any&#13;
duplication with the World Bank. In a country like Thailand, for instance, or take India, we&#13;
provideâ&#128;&#148;we are primarily a project-lending institution. So we can provide a sort of&#13;
complementarity to the lending by the World Bank. They can provide, for instance, a much&#13;
bigger financial sector loan than we can because our size is small. We can--it is a kind of&#13;
comparative advantage in terms of economic analysis, in terms of the kind of macroeconomic&#13;
work that can be done, in terms of the macroeconomic impact of the Bank, whereas we can&#13;
concentrate more on the micro side. Now, we do do a certain amount of program lending which&#13;
is basically policy-based [inaudible] lending. But by agreement with the donors we restrict that&#13;
to 15 percent of our total lending. So I don't know what the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s limits are.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But is that of the total lending or lending to a particular country?&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: No, it's of the total lending. For particular countries it actually exceeds.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: For program lending.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Oh, so you do.&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: So we do do program lending, but again, even in our program lending we&#13;
coordinate very closely with the World Bank and the IMF because--and this is probably an&#13;
example of how at least the three institutions, I mean taking ourselves I'm sure it happens with&#13;
[inaudible] but in this region how these three institutions are getting closer and closer together&#13;
because we would not, for instance, wish to undercut the IMF in terms of conditionalities or, say,&#13;
the policy framework level. So that is where there is very close coordination. Now, if itâ&#128;&#153;sâ&#128;&#148;if we&#13;
are just giving a loan for, say, construction of a road somewhere, then you don't have to worry&#13;
with the IMF. But it you're making policy conditionalities, then you really have to work closely&#13;
with something like the IMF, to see what kind of policy conditionalities they have had in their&#13;
last consultation or maybe for their [inaudible] and make sure that yours are not in conflict with&#13;
those or do not undercut those.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But there is a flip side to that [inaudible] say, the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s approach, freezing&#13;
links between the Bank and the Fund, a feeling of ganging up, of crossâ&#128;&#148;of conditionalities, so&#13;
on and so forth.&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: That's right.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: How do you see the flip side, on the one hand, together or converging, then, of course,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                    9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the differences get less and less, and that might be good for the institutions, and but the LDCs&#13;
[less developed countries] might not necessarily . . .&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: No, certainly from the LDCs point of view there is, there could be this feeling that&#13;
people are ganging up against them. The feeling is somewhat less against something like the&#13;
ADB, again because the volume is smaller. And basically, you see, this is where the kind of&#13;
conditionalities that we would impose for our program loans are likely to be a subset of the&#13;
conditionalities that the IMF would have imposed or [inaudible] for instance. Whereas in the&#13;
case of the World Bank, if you gave a major structural adjustment loan, you would have a totally&#13;
different set of conditionalities which might not necessarily be at variance with those prescribed&#13;
by the IMFâ&#128;&#148;but, I mean, they could complement those prescribed by the IMF, but then the LDC&#13;
is faced with two sets of conditionalities.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That's how it actually works, that often you use a subset? Is it explicitly that way?&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Not explicitly, but that's how it would work out in practice because, you see, we&#13;
would really beâ&#128;&#148;it could--after all our program loan would be what, say $100 million, $150&#13;
million. And how much leverage could we really have with that? You see, this is, this is again a&#13;
basic difference, I think, and I should have touched on it earlier. The extent of leverage that this&#13;
bank can exercise as against the World Bank, and this I think is another major difference. I don't&#13;
know whether this comes out as plus or minus. You could look at it either way. But, I mean, take&#13;
a country like India, for instance, and we often have these complaints in the board, saying, you&#13;
know, "Why didn't you impose these and these conditionalities?" Now, what is the leverage of&#13;
the ADB in a country like India? Very, very limited.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You gain enormous leverage when you work along with the other institutions, but you&#13;
also lose a flexibility, I imagine.&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: That's right, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. But an institution like the World Bank or the IMF has&#13;
much greater leverage. But there are countries where our lending--I think Pakistan is probably&#13;
one of them--I don't know if the World Bank is lending to Indonesia, but ours is well over a&#13;
billion now, so that's not insignificant. Now, so in a country like Indonesia you would have very&#13;
considerable leverage.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Actually, as a matter of volume, you have as much leverage as the Bank, really&#13;
[inaudible] but the thing is the Bank has the leverage that its leadership of the development&#13;
world, and thatâ&#128;&#153;s a big difference.&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Actually, if you look at the figures for net transfers rather than commitments--because&#13;
the ADB has got into many of these countries much later than these countries were getting World&#13;
Bank loans or have even now paid back, in terms of net transfers the ADB, I would say, I would&#13;
guess, would not, would in some cases, more. In Latin America the IADB in the early '90s will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                November 27, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
be lending more in net transfers than the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Yeah, we have not hadâ&#128;&#148;we got close to a negative resource flow, but we didn't&#13;
actually allow it to happen. So in our case the flow of resources is still positive. I think it's&#13;
positive for every country. I think we've got fairly close to Indonesia, I mean got close to getting&#13;
a negative resource flow, but it didn't actually happen, so whereas in the case of the World Bank&#13;
perhaps it has a negative [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Did you see here in the Bank the very close [inaudible] that could be called a search&#13;
for special relationships with the borrowing countries, I mean, you know, over and above just&#13;
being a banker?&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Yes, there is, there is. And this is, I think, a feeling that is derived from being in&#13;
this region and being physically close to them. You see, we [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Define those?&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Well, for instance, we travel much more frequently to our countries because--let's&#13;
take any of the ASEAN [Association of Southeast Asian Nations] countries. It's just three hours'&#13;
flight to Malaysia or Bangkok. We also, therefore, can go back and forth much more frequently.&#13;
Now, someone comes out from Washington. He stays there for two, three weeks. Now, that's got&#13;
its plus side, too. But for us we keep going and coming back as frequently. Their people visit us&#13;
much more frequently than they do in terms of visits to Washington. So that is certainly an&#13;
advantage in terms of being a regional bank.&#13;
&#13;
And we do feel, for instance, in the case of Cambodia, which is now emerging on the world&#13;
scene, we did feel that, you know, it's not a question of racing with the World Bank, but we have&#13;
a special obligation because itâ&#128;&#153;s, you know, this region itâ&#128;&#153;s us. We have a special obligation to&#13;
Cambodia. It's the same reason that Mr. [Kimimasa] Tarumizuâ&#128;&#153;s predecessor, President [Masao]&#13;
Fujioka, felt a kind of compulsion to bring China into this bank. It was a long and painful process&#13;
involving a lot of hard work because we had the problem of having Taiwan, which the World&#13;
Bank doesn't have, so--and there was--and Taiwan was a founding member as Republic of China&#13;
so it was not occupying the mainland seat. So you had to devise a compromise by which both&#13;
could be in this institution.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Do you find this bank [inaudible] develop a kind of relationship, a kind of dialogue&#13;
with its foreign governments [inaudible] because they're sensed as more our own, theyâ&#128;&#153;re more&#13;
understanding . . .&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: It varies. It varies from country to country. When I was working on Thailand, for&#13;
instance, I definitely had that feeling when we were working with, when we were doing what&#13;
was then our fifth loan to IFCT, the Industrial Finance Corporation of Thailand. And I think the&#13;
World Bank had provided one loan or something. And we certainly had--I mean, this was quite&#13;
explicit--we certainly had a very close relationship with the IFCT, much closer, I mean, they said&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Arun Adarkar&#13;
                                November 27, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
that they felt much closer to us than they did to the World Bank although there was a World&#13;
Bank resident office in Bangkok.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You don't develop big resident offices, do you?&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: No, we have very few resident offices. We are, if I might say so, much more cost-&#13;
conscious than, say, the IADB which has resident offices for all of the countries. We have, we&#13;
have certain established criteria for setting up resident offices. We have one in Dacca in&#13;
Bangladesh, which was our first one. We now--and then we have one in Pakistan and we have&#13;
one in Indonesia. And we have a regional office in the South Pacific in Port Vila, Vanuatu, and&#13;
that services our Pacific needs. We are contemplating opening one more resident office this year,&#13;
according to corridor gossip, in India. And we have a facilitating office in Nepal which is not a&#13;
resident office [inaudible] but it helps to facilitate, you know, getting contracts or disbursements&#13;
[inaudible] the government [inaudible] and so on. But that's only a facilitating office, a two-man&#13;
office.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You travel an awful lot.&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Yes. Our people travel a fair amount but again itâ&#128;&#153;s within the region. And we&#13;
haveâ&#128;&#148;well, now, of course, most airlines have only business class, but our travel policy is first&#13;
class only for principal officers and board members and management, unlike the World Bank&#13;
which--of course, that has a zoning system--but in our case those who travel first class travel first&#13;
class irrespective of distance. And they also travel first class with families on home leave,&#13;
whereas the World Bank has a [inaudible] three year option, but a normal two year home leave&#13;
travel would be only business class.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The Bank has held onto that despite . . .&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Despite the pressures from the U.S. Congress.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Well, [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Pardon?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The World Bank is changing [inaudible] very strong.&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: You know, although I enjoy that benefit, I must say that one has to admit it is&#13;
becoming less and less defensible.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: When it was started, there was an argument that business class [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Some sense that in certain parts of the world the World Bank sort of and whether&#13;
[inaudible] when it comes to specific investments in projects that the Bank is perceived to be&#13;
poaching at times and grabbing the best projects [inaudible] muscle and leverage and so on. Is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                November 27, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
that the perception here?&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: No, I donâ&#128;&#153;t--that may be a perception amongst some staff members, but I don't&#13;
think it's a fair perception, again, because there really is room for both institutions. To give you&#13;
an example, again when I was working on Thailand--this was some years ago--but there was a&#13;
natural gas pipeline project. You know, Thailand has a lot of offshore gas which was just coming&#13;
up at that time, and we were planning to co-finance this project with the World Bank. And the&#13;
World Bank team went to Bangkok and stopped here on the way back. And we found that lo and&#13;
behold virtually what was left for us was fencing--and I'm exaggerating--but, you know, the sort&#13;
of remnants of the project. Everything had been taken by the World Bank. And, of course, you&#13;
know, we recommended to our vice president that, you know, we shouldn't be seen as at the tail&#13;
end of the project, we shouldnâ&#128;&#153;t . . . Some, of course, felt that we should continue [inaudible]&#13;
And I said, "Well, look, I'm convinced that this isn't the only project in the natural gas sector in&#13;
Thailand. So I am going to [inaudible] staff." He said, "Well, letâ&#128;&#153;s give us a chance. Let's go to&#13;
Bangkok and talk to the natural gas authority of Thailand and see what they have." And we&#13;
developed a perfectly good, completely different project which was, I mean, as important to&#13;
them as the World Bank project. And this was not--it was not a question of competing with the&#13;
World Bank, but we had programmed that amount. And I said, "Well, let's just see. I mean, I&#13;
can't believe that this is the only project available in Thailand." So I think there is a certain&#13;
amount of complementarity involved in it. I see it more in terms of complementarity rather than&#13;
competition. I don't think there should be competition between the two institutions anyway. We&#13;
shouldn't be grabbing each other's projects.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Are these issues--everything you do there would be cross-cut with the World Bank.&#13;
Sometimes it's cut to the bone in your board?&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Oh, yes. Quite often. In fact, there is more and more demand for greater&#13;
coordination between the Bank and development institutions, and that coordination is in fact a&#13;
base. Very often missions from the World Bank, whenever they are in this part of the world,&#13;
drop in here. This has been happening for years. And now, of course, with the telephone and&#13;
FAXes the communications are much easier here, so I would say there is fairly close&#13;
coordination with the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: We've been quite fascinated with the role Japan plays in the World Bank, seeing how&#13;
there are indications of change from the current ED [Executive Director] in particular, and he is&#13;
surprisingly frank about the, his perception that [inaudible] Japan and that are driving his own&#13;
priorities to the board. Some of it has to do with differences [inaudible] that have to do with&#13;
development [inaudible] development, others are [inaudible] improvement in performance. It's&#13;
interesting. I mean, one wonders how it will play itself out. But the sense here is the ADB&#13;
[inaudible] because it's so much of a larger participation.&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: That's true, but . . .&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I wonder if you sense difference here in development policy or development thinking?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Arun Adarkar&#13;
                                November 27, 1991 â&#128;&#147; Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: No, I can't really say that I sense any difference in development thinking. And I'd&#13;
also like to say--and I'm not sure whether this view is shared by many people. I mean, I'm&#13;
conscious of that, but I know it's often said--and I'm sure it is so perceived--that while the World&#13;
Bank is Anglo-Saxon dominated, this is Japanese dominated. Now, I've talked to people in the&#13;
World Bank and they certainly confirm that they have this feeling that the Bank is U.S.&#13;
dominated. I have not had the feeling here that this is Japanese dominated, and in a sense I can&#13;
see that this is surprising because it does have such a large presence. But one doesn't get this&#13;
feeling that it's Japanese dominated. Where Japan's role does come in is that, obviously, the&#13;
president is Japanese, and it's very unlikely, for instance--although this has happened--that we&#13;
would take a proposal to the board which does not have the support of Japan. We have done it,&#13;
incidentally, but the point is that this is for practical reasons in the sense that the concept of this&#13;
bank was based on equal shares for Japan and the U.S. and their voting [inaudible] . So it was a&#13;
system of checks and balances. So you have to have the support of either the U.S. or Japan plus&#13;
the support of part of the Europeans or the Asians to get something through.&#13;
&#13;
Now, this is where the interesting difference comes in. You can get a proposal through the board&#13;
with the support of Japan and without the support of the United States, but if you didn't have the&#13;
support of either the United States or Japan, then you don't really have a hope. And, you see, and&#13;
this is where you have a slightly different relationship between the Bank on the one hand and&#13;
Japan and the U.S. on the other.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Both institutions are [inaudible] really only talking about a matter of degree. But I&#13;
thought maybe there might beâ&#128;&#148;because it somehow also, I think, relates to the differentiation&#13;
that is in other ways [inaudible] commercial banks. The French [inaudible] specialized. The&#13;
multinationals might also [inaudible] I can imagine them developing in that direction. And one&#13;
aspect of that might be what could be called a sense of priorities. I wondered if some of that was&#13;
developing here. Itâ&#128;&#153;s hard to see from outside.&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Yeah, I don't really see it.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: What you say fits very well with [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Yeah, I donâ&#128;&#153;tâ&#128;&#148;I honestly haven't noticed that. I mean, I've heard this so I've been&#13;
conscious of this. But I can't say that I've noticed it even from the inside. I can't see a different&#13;
development philosophy as such, except, as I said, in terms of our being within the region, our&#13;
feeling a special obligation to the countries of this region, which I don't think has anything to do&#13;
with the fact that Japan is the largest member. I think that stems from the basic philosophy of the&#13;
institution.&#13;
&#13;
You see, youâ&#128;&#153;ve got to look at it from another point of view. Japan has now got a fairly large&#13;
influence on its own in many of these countries (a) because it is obviously the biggest industrial&#13;
power in this part of the world, but (b) also because of its fairly significant bilateral programs.&#13;
So, I meanâ&#128;&#148;we haveâ&#128;&#148;I mean when I was dealing with Malaysia, for instance, the Malaysians&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
have asked us to bow out of the project because they said that this is--the Japanese want to&#13;
finance this under their [inaudible] , I mean, you know, this kind of thing. So Japan's presence in&#13;
individual countries is really quite significant. I don't think we need the ADB to project its&#13;
presence in this situation, and there's no reason for them to therefore want to twist the Bank to&#13;
any particular development philosophy. And as I said, Japan is only one of the donors. Now,&#13;
even for the soft funds, for instance, okay, it is a major donor, but it's only one of the donors.&#13;
Likewise for the capital, Japan and the U.S. are equal.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is Korea yet a donor?&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: Korea is--we don't have a formal "graduation" policy, but Korea is no longer a&#13;
borrower.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yes, but it's not a lender.&#13;
&#13;
ADARKAR: It's donatingâ&#128;&#148;itâ&#128;&#153;s making a contribution to the Asian Development Fund at this&#13;
time, which . . .&#13;
