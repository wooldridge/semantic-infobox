STATUTORY COMMITTEE REPORT&#13;
TO:    The President, International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#13;
Report of the Committee under Section 4 (iii) of Article III of the Articles of Agreement&#13;
on the proposed Loan (Environmental Services Project) to the Republic of Albania&#13;
The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 7 of Article V of the Articles of&#13;
Agreement of International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) hereby submits&#13;
its report pursuant to Section 4 (iii) of Article III of said Articles in respect of the proposal that&#13;
the Bank grant to the Republic of Albania (the Borrower) a loan in an amount of seven million&#13;
three hundred thousand Euro (EUR 7,300,000). The purpose of said loan is to support sustainable&#13;
land management practices and increase communities' monetary and non-monetary benefits, in&#13;
targeted Project areas which are mainly in erosion prone rural upland areas. The Project is also&#13;
supported by a grant from the Global Environment Facility in an amount equal to two million&#13;
eight hundred and eighty thousand United States Dollars (US$2,880,000).&#13;
1.    The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to grant such a loan, and&#13;
of the purpose to which the proceeds of the loan are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The Committee is of the opinion that the project toward the financing of which the&#13;
proceeds of such loan are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Bank as set forth in&#13;
Article I of said Articles of Agreement, and that said Project is designed to promote the&#13;
development of the productive facilities and resources of the Borrower and is in the interest of the&#13;
Borrower and of the members of the Bank as a whole.&#13;
