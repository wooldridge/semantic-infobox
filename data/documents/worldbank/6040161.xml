            Aid effectiveness : can aid agencies be

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Private financial flows such as foreign
            direct investment seem toencourage economic growth and
            relieve poverty in part because theycreate excellent
            incentives for transferring know-how and in partbecause they
            are subject to a stern market test that ensures they
            areallocated and monitored carefully. For aid flows, not
            automaticallysubject to these disciplines, it is difficult
            to be as effective. ThisNote argues that aid agencies, by
            learning what makes private flowsso effective, can bring
            better aid to the poorest.
