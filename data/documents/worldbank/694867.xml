1. THE URBAN TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.1          Argentina is one of the most urbanized countries in Latin America. Over 87 percent of&#13;
the total population lives in urban areas of 2,000 or more inhabitants. Despite its high level of&#13;
urbanization, Argentina is still experiencing significant growth in its urban population. Between 1980 and&#13;
1991 urban areas grew from 23.2 million to 28.4 million inhabitants (1.9 percent per year). Today 12.4&#13;
million persons, or almost 38 percent of the country's population, are concentrated in the Buenos Aires&#13;
Metropolitan Area (AMBA).1 Population densities are high with nearly 14,800 persons per km2 in the city&#13;
of Buenos Aires (roughly the same as Paris). The city population (3 million) is growing at a rate of 0.7&#13;
percent per year. Yet some of the suburban municipalities are growing at a rate ten times faster (17&#13;
percent per year). Sound urban transport management is critical for meeting the growing transport needs&#13;
of the AMBA.&#13;
1.2          There are nearly 6.5 million motor vehicles in Argentina. On the average week day, 2.5&#13;
million cars circulate in the AMBA alone. Private car ownership has been on the rise, with about 150,000&#13;
vehicles being added to the fleet in the AMBA every year. Largely because of the rapidly increasing car&#13;
ownership, the share of public transportation in the AMBA has fallen from 75 percent of motorized trips in&#13;
1970 to 61 percent in 1994. On the other hand, trips by car have increased from 2.7 million trips per day&#13;
in 1970 to 4.5 million per day in 1991, a 60 percent increase.&#13;
1.3          The sharp increase in traffic in the city of Buenos Aires, particularly in the central area's&#13;
narrow streets, has led to growing congestion, rising air pollution, and an increasing number of traffic&#13;
accidents. As a result, the National Congress announced a state of traffic emergency for the city of&#13;
Buenos Aires in 1994 and created a special committee comprising representatives of the Transport&#13;
Secretariat and the Municipality of Buenos Aires. Since then several measures have been implemented&#13;
to help alleviate the rising congestion problem. Most cars, for example, are now restricted from&#13;
circulating in the central area (Microcentro) during the hours of 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. These measures, had a&#13;
marginal impact in the Microcentro, but car congestion accentuated by 10,000 buses and 40,000 taxis&#13;
persists in most other parts of Buenos Aires. Substantial social costs are generated by travel delays, fuel&#13;
consumption, and health problems from air pollution and traffic accidents. Strengthening public&#13;
transportation is a crucial step in reducing these costs. The subway and suburban railways have a strong&#13;
potential for alleviating many traffio-related problems in the AMBA.&#13;
1.4          Public transportation in the AMBA is provided by 15,000 private buses, by a 44-km&#13;
subway network, and by seven suburban railway operations 900 km in length. The rise in the number of&#13;
private cars and the deterioration of the subway and suburban rail services led to a drop in the number of&#13;
people using public transportation. Between 1984 and 1993, suburban rail usage dropped more than 30&#13;
percent; the number of subway passengers decreased by more than 20 percent during the same period.&#13;
1.5          Until 1993, unreliable schedules and security concems contributed to the decline in&#13;
ridership. Compounded by inefficient management, the results were unsustainable operating deficits. At&#13;
US$150-250 million per year, operating losses on the AMBA suburban railway accounted for 25-40&#13;
percent of the entire annual deficits for the Ferrocarriles Argentinos, the Government organization that&#13;
operated all the railways in Argentina. With a view towards reducing operating subsidies by increasing&#13;
efficiency, quality and thus ridership, the Argentine Govemment decided in 1991 to concession both&#13;
Ferrocamles Argentinos and the Subterrfneos de Buenos Aires (the subway) to private operators.&#13;
1.6          The state-owned Ferrocamles Argentinos used to be the sole provider of both railway&#13;
passenger and cargo services. In 1991 the Govemment called for bids on operating concessions for&#13;
various rail packages as a means of introducing private sector participation in Argentine railways. The&#13;
privatization program included six inter-urban rail packages (mostly freight) and seven suburban&#13;
The Buenos Almes Metropolitan Area, as defined by "Pre-ATAM," includes the municipality of Buenos Aires and 36 other&#13;
municipaltes boated within a 60-km radius.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
passenger packages in the AMBA. By mid-1993, most inter-urban passenger rail services were&#13;
discontinued. The responsibility for those which remained was transferred from the National Govemment&#13;
to the provincial govemments.&#13;
1.7          Passenger service in the AMBA, including the subway, was reorganized under the&#13;
Coordination Unit for the Railway Restructuring Program (UCPF). The privatization of commuter rail&#13;
service in the AMBA was initiated by subdividing the network into seven packages to be concessioned&#13;
together with the five subway lines and the pre-metro2 line. It was envisaged that the concessionaires&#13;
would operate the awarded lines and execute the capital investments specified in the contract. Under the&#13;
concession, the Govemment would continue to own the infrastructure and rolling stock, and would&#13;
finance investments to modemize antiquated parts of the system.&#13;
1.8          As detailed in Chapter II, bids for 10-year concessions (20 years for the subway and&#13;
Urquiza line) were solicited based on service parameters set by the National Govemment, including&#13;
frequency, capacity and fares. The winning bidder was the one requiring the lowest Govemment&#13;
payment on a net-present-value basis. In January 1994 a 20-year concession became effective for the&#13;
subway along with the suburban Urquiza line (having the same track gauge as the subway system). With&#13;
the transfer of the Mitre/Sarmiento systems in May 1995, the entire passenger rail system of the AMBA&#13;
is now operated by the privaite sector.&#13;
1.9          The initial results of private operation are encouraging. In 1996 suburban passenger&#13;
volumes were 95 percent above the level of 1993, and subway ridership had increased by 37 percent.&#13;
While some of the increase in paying passengers is attributable to a reduction in fare evasion, the net&#13;
increase is primarily due to improved service quality.&#13;
B. Institutional Framework&#13;
1.10         Transportation in the AMBA is subject to the regulatory and fiscal policies of the national,&#13;
provincial and municipal govemments. The National Govemment is responsible for construction and&#13;
maintenance of national highways, for financing investments and operating subsidies for the suburban&#13;
railways and the subway, and for regulating the 147 commuter bus lines (connecting the city with&#13;
suburban districts of the AMBA) which represent roughly half of the 15,000 buses that operate in the&#13;
AMBA, and for regulating the approximately 3,000 buses operating entirely within the city of Buenos&#13;
Aires. Furthermore, the National Govemment's Traffic Police Division is responsible for traffic control&#13;
and enforcement.&#13;
1.11         The Provincial Govemment of Buenos Aires is responsible for the construction and&#13;
maintenance of provincial roads and for the rail passenger services between Buenos Aires and Mar del&#13;
Plata. It also controls 59 provincial (inter-municipal) bus lines which account for about 20 percent of the&#13;
AMBA bus fleet. The Municipality of the City of Buenos Aires (MCBA) is the owner of the subway&#13;
infrastructure and rolling stock and is in charge of road and traffic management within the boundaries of&#13;
the city.&#13;
1.12         One of the major sources of existing inefficiencies in the AMBA transport system is the&#13;
lack of coordination and planning among the various jurisdictions and among the agencies responsible&#13;
for road management and public transport provision. The results are high social costs from the&#13;
congestion, pollution, traffic accidents, uneconomic investment programs, and decreasing levels of&#13;
service in many areas.&#13;
C. Sector Issues&#13;
1.13         Institutional Issues. Various attempts have been made to improve coordination among&#13;
the three independent jurisdictions. To date, however, the AMBA is still lacking a consistent, coherent&#13;
and cooperative approach to urban transport management. The quality, regulations (including motor&#13;
2  S    Nhe    it rail trarsit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
vehicle emission standards), enforcement and administration vary widely among the three jurisdictions.&#13;
In addition, neither intermodal nor intramodal fare integration has been achieved, resulting in avoidable&#13;
costs and travel time increases.&#13;
1.14         Proposals were formulated in 1991 to create a multi-jurisdictional entity to facilitate joint&#13;
planning, regulation and control of urban transport in the AMBA. Based on an agreement signed by the&#13;
Mayor of Buenos Aires and the Minister of Economy, a working group called Apoyo a la Creaci6n de la&#13;
Autoridad de Transporte del Area Metropolitana (Pre-ATAM) was created to define and develop an&#13;
autonomous Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (ATAM). The ATAM would have been responsible for&#13;
planning and regulating the AMBA transport system. The political environment, however, was such that&#13;
the bill to create the ATAM failed to be passed by the Argentine Congress. The Pre-ATAM by default&#13;
assumed some of the functions of the proposed ATAM, although with a much more limited mandate, and&#13;
grew into a widely respected entity of transport specialists. It was recently converted into a Transport&#13;
Planning Unit (TUAMBA) under the Ministry of Economy and Public Works and Services.&#13;
1.15         Financial and Economic Issues. Priority investments to rehabilitate and modemize the&#13;
subway and suburban railways were identified, and a detailed investment program for each line was&#13;
included in the concession agreements. The concessionaires are undertaking the physical improvements&#13;
on a repayment basis as specified in those agreements. As Government payments for completed works&#13;
lag some 30 days behind the concessionaires' expenses for the improvement programs, the&#13;
concessionaires are obliged to bridge the financing gap from their own resources during this time. The&#13;
main financial issues relate to the successful continuation of the concessions and the availability of the&#13;
resources necessary to further modemize and expand the systems. This may require the renegotiation of&#13;
the concession contracts to extend them beyond their current duration, taking into account the&#13;
experience gained by the concessionaires and Govemment.&#13;
1.16         Environmental Issues. A recent World Bank Study3 concluded that traffic-generated air&#13;
pollution has become a major problem in the inner sections of Buenos Aires. One of the study's&#13;
recommendations, to establish a modem system of air pollution monitoring, is the basis of the project&#13;
component described in Annex J.&#13;
D. Lessons Learned in Past Bank Projects&#13;
1.17         Bank Experience in the Argentine Railway Sector. To date, the Bank has undertaken&#13;
three lending operations in the Argentine railway sector. The first two operations focused on investments&#13;
in infrastructure and rolling stock. One of the main lessons emerging from these operations is the need&#13;
for demand-oriented investment planning. In both cases, neglect of demand factors adversely affected&#13;
cost recovery. The third lending operation, the Public Enterprise Reform Adjustment Loan (Ln. 3291-AR),&#13;
helped in restructuring the Argentine railways while providing a safety net for about 70,000 redundancies.&#13;
1.18         Bank Experience with Similar Projects Elsewhere. Bank-wide experience with private&#13;
railway concessions is still quite limited. There is, however, significant experience from Brazil in&#13;
formulating a comprehensive urban transport approach from which the following lessons can be gleaned:&#13;
(a) lack of counterpart funds is one of the primary causes of project delays; (b) effective regulatory&#13;
agencies are critical to private sector participation; (c) clear institutional responsibilities greatly improve&#13;
the effectiveness of implementation; and (d) proposed investments and institutional changes should be&#13;
compatible with an overall regional transport plan.&#13;
E. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
1.19         The Bank's country assistance strategy discussed at the Board on May 4, 1995, and an&#13;
update, discussed on April 25, 1996, aim to: (a) consolidate macroeconomic reforms, particularly by&#13;
strengthening weak public institutions; (b) rebuild deteriorated infrastructure; and (c) help Argentina's&#13;
poor adjust to the country's fast-paced changes. The proposed project would directly address the first two&#13;
3  World Bank 1995, Arentinan-Manalng Environmental Poluion: Issues and OpOons, Report 14070-AR, Washington, D.C.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
objectives by supporting recent reforms in the AMBA's urban transport sector and by financing the&#13;
rehabilitation of long-neglected transport infrastructure. Further, it would deepen the Bank's previous&#13;
involvement, through the Public Enterprise Reform Adjustment Loan, in the privatization of the Argentine&#13;
railways. Buenos Aires is now in the forefront of private mass transit, but its reforms are still quite recent&#13;
and potentially fragile. The Bank's continued support could be vital for the viability of increased private&#13;
sector participation in urban rail services-an approach that could be replicated in other large urban&#13;
areas, fitting with the proposed CAS, which highlights provincial reform and development as one of the&#13;
three current key development objectives.&#13;
F. Sector Strategy&#13;
1.20          Buenos Aires has no urban transport sector strategy per se. There is no single institution&#13;
responsible for urban transport planning in the metropolitan area. The proposal to create such an&#13;
authority (ATAM) failed to gain political support. The body set up as a precursor (pre-ATAM) has been&#13;
acting successfully as an informal coordination group, achieving positive  actions such as the&#13;
implementation of reserved bus lanes; it was recently renamed Transporte Urbano del Area&#13;
Metropolitana de Buenos Aires (TUAMBA) with a view to establish it as a permanent planning group&#13;
under the Secretariat of Public Works and Transport (SOPyT) within the Ministry of Economy.&#13;
Responsibility for the elements which together determine the nature of urban transport in Buenos Aires&#13;
remains fragmented. There is relatively little formal collaboration or coordination of policy in areas in&#13;
which the jurisdictions overlap. For example, public transport and some major road investments in the&#13;
AMBA are the responsibility of SOPyT, while investments and maintenance of the vast majority of the&#13;
road network are handled by the provincial or municipal govemments.&#13;
1.21          The issues arising from rail privatization at the national level have been analyzed in a&#13;
recent Bank report.4 Those issues which relate to the Buenos Aires subway and suburban railway system&#13;
were taken into account in the preparation of this project. As there are no recent evaluations of the other&#13;
aspects of urban transport in the AMBA, the Bank's project preparation team conducted an independent&#13;
assessment which is described in Annex A and summarized below.&#13;
1.22          From the viewpoint of the Bank's experience in the urban transport sector, the transport&#13;
characteristics of the AMBA present a mixed picture. The emphasis on private rail and bus operation&#13;
compares well with international experience on supply efficiency in urban transport. The existence of&#13;
competition between overlapping routes in a regulated framework for the bus industry also appears to be&#13;
a good practice.&#13;
1.23          What is missing at present is any effective planning and implementation of traffic&#13;
management, any coordination of road traffic and public transport policy implementation, and any&#13;
concerted effort to deal with the safety and environmental problems associated with metropolitan&#13;
transport. To some extent that is a matter of intemal coordination between the Transport and Public&#13;
Works Agencies. One of the aims of the project is to improve that relationship through association in the&#13;
management of a technical group for metropolitan transport planning.&#13;
1.24          Despite the constraints on what is immediately possible, the case for improved&#13;
interfunctional and interjurisdictional coordination remains. The philosophy of the project is therefore to&#13;
help introduce measures aimed at increasing commitment to a greater level of metropolitan transport&#13;
coordination. It is believed that this can best be achieved by demonstrating the possibilities and&#13;
advantages of coordinated action, based on strong technical capability, to deal with commonly&#13;
recognized problems. The strategy of the project is to encourage this in three ways:&#13;
(a)   the development of a core group of technical skills in metropolitan transport&#13;
planning to ensure a sound technical basis for the design and implementation of&#13;
metropolitan transport and traffic measures;&#13;
4  World Bank 1996, Argenbn,-Transport Pnvaizabon and Regulaton: The Next Wave of Chalenges. Report 14469-AR,&#13;
Washington, D.C.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(b)   the carrying out of an urban transport study which would require the cooperation&#13;
of diverse agencies throughout the metropolitan area, and produce planning&#13;
tools and projections useful to all of them; and&#13;
(c)   the creation of a management committee, which would include representatives&#13;
of the different functions and jurisdictional levels, to identify problems common&#13;
to the separate jurisdictions and to provide policy guidance to the technical core&#13;
group.&#13;
1.25         The development of the technical capacity to adequately address the complex&#13;
interactions within the urban transport system is at the center of the strategy for institutional&#13;
strengthening. The first part of the strategy is to establish a project implementation unit for the World&#13;
Bank project, which would be technically oriented and have close links with the new core group&#13;
developed for metropolitan transport planning. These groups would be the agencies responsible for the&#13;
assembly of the metropolitan transport data base and analysis capability and would have staff&#13;
representation from road and transport agencies.&#13;
1.26         The second part of the strategy is to associate those entities, who would benefit from a&#13;
more coordinated approach, in the management of the technical group and the urban transport study.&#13;
The purpose of the management committee (representing the various functional and jurisdictional&#13;
authorities) would be to identify issues of common concern suitable for analysis at the metropolitan level;&#13;
to address these issues the skills of the technical group would be made available. The initial approach to&#13;
coordination is thus problem-oriented, boUtom-up," but with a long-term view of converting the&#13;
committee into a permanent body responsible for transport planning for the entire metropolitan area.&#13;

II. FRAMEWORK OF URBAN RAIL CONCESSIONS&#13;
A. Background&#13;
2.1          The AMBA is among the world's largest metropolitan areas. In 1991 nearly 5 billion trips&#13;
were generated in the area, of which 3.4 billion were by public transport. Passenger railway services&#13;
carried 209 million passengers annually in 2,000 trains over a network of 900 km and 267 stations. The&#13;
AMBA's 44-km subway system served another 144 million annual trips.&#13;
2.2          Prior to the Govemment's decision to restructure the suburban rail services through&#13;
concessions in 1990, the network had been in rapid decline. Between 1970 and 1991, while the&#13;
population of the metropolitan area rose from 8.4 to 10.9 million people, both the subway and the&#13;
suburban railways lost nearly half of their passengers.&#13;
2.3          Since 1961, passenger services had been organized under Fefrocamles Argentinos&#13;
(FA). Under this arrangement each of the six divisions operating in Buenos Aires was responsible for&#13;
freight and passenger services. This latter category of service had grown to nearly 500 million paying&#13;
passengers per year at the time of FA's creation. For most people, the railways were the predominant&#13;
mode of transportation.&#13;
2.4          The reasons for the decline suffered by the passenger services were similar to those&#13;
experienced by Argentina's railway system as a whole. Due to a lack of a commercial outlook, the focus&#13;
was more on production targets than on satisfying user needs. Management was also heavily influenced&#13;
by the interests of labor unions and equipment suppliers. There were too many employees, outdated&#13;
operating practices, little maintenance, and no new investments. Even though the potential market for&#13;
mass transit had grown and services had been attractively priced, the progressive deterioration of&#13;
service quality, reliability and security led to a rapid decline in passengers from the 1 960s onwards.&#13;
2.5          By the end of the 1980s, FA passenger services had become unreliable, stations had&#13;
deteriorated, fare evasion was extremely high, and grade-crossing accidents were increasing in&#13;
frequency. In March 1990, at the height of a 75-day railway strike which virtually paralyzed all passenger&#13;
services, Metropolitan Railways (FEMESA) was created as a state-owned corporation separate from FA.&#13;
FEMESA's objective was to provide commuter services within the AMBA. Subsequently, the&#13;
Govemment decided to privatize FEMESA.&#13;
B. The Concession Process&#13;
2.6          The concession process was set in motion with the passage of the State Reform and&#13;
Public Enterprise Restructuring Law in 1989. The law's aim was to reduce the public deficit and revitalize&#13;
the economy by encouraging private sector operation of major state-owned enterprises. Of all state&#13;
enterprises, FA was responsible for the largest drain on the national treasury-about US$1.4 billion&#13;
annually, of which approximately US$465 million was incurred by the Buenos Aires suburban rail&#13;
network. Reducing the losses represented the main motivation for restructuring the railways by&#13;
concessioning their operation to the private sector.&#13;
2.7          The suburban railway services were grouped into seven different rail networks that had&#13;
existed in the 1950s before the creation of FA: Mitre, Sarmiento, Urquiza, Roca, San Martin, Belgrano&#13;
Norte and Belgrano Sur. The subway, consisting of five underground metro lines and a surface light&#13;
railway line, and owned by the Municipal Government's Subtejrrneos de Buenos Aires S.E. (SBASE),&#13;
was placed in a bidding package with the Urquiza line which shares the same track gauge and is&#13;
physically connected with the subway.&#13;
2.8          The concessioning of Buenos Aires' subway and suburban railways was unique. There is&#13;
no precedent in the world of using the concession approach for a loss-making urban rail transit system.&#13;
Buenos Aires' subway system is old and obsolete, with several original sections dating from its opening&#13;
in 1913. Since the 1950s there have been few improvements. When the decision to concession the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
subway was made, the system was in need of a complete rehabilitation, including tracks, communication,&#13;
signaling systems, escalators and cars.&#13;
2.9            After the multi-faceted evaluation method used for concessioning the freight railways&#13;
proved controversial, the Govemment adopted a single quantifiable parameter for awarding the&#13;
concessions for the suburban railways and the subway. Following an intemational competitive bidding&#13;
process, the concessionaires were selected based on the lowest Govemment payment requested in the&#13;
bid to operate the line and undertake the specified investment program.5 Under this arrangement, the&#13;
concessionaires operate the lines and the Govemment (i.e., FEMESA in the case of the suburban&#13;
railways and SBASE in the case of the subway) continues to own the infrastructure and rolling stock.&#13;
Table 2.1 summarizes the main features of the metropolitan railway concessions.&#13;
Table 2.1: Features of the Metropolitan Railway Concessions&#13;
Length                10 years (20 years for the subway and the Urquiza line) plus optional 10-year&#13;
extensions indefinitely.&#13;
Ownership             The National Govemment (the City in the case of the subway) remains the&#13;
owner of the fixed facilities, including track, stations, and rolling stock.&#13;
Labor                 Concessionaires can introduce whatever labor practices they consider&#13;
necessary to increase labor productivity. Labor redundancy was financed by&#13;
the Govemment.&#13;
Operations and        All operations are performed by the concessionaires, who are also&#13;
Maintenance           responsible for the maintenance of track and rolling stock. The&#13;
concessionaires either receive an operating subsidy or pay a 'fee' for the use&#13;
of the infrastructure. The Govemment sets minimum service level and&#13;
service quality for each concession.&#13;
Tariffs               The Govemment sets maximum fares which are subject to automatic&#13;
increases according to the service quality achieved and increases in the cost&#13;
of providing the service. Non-achievement of quality levels results in financial&#13;
penalties.&#13;
Capital Investment   Concessionaires undertake project-specific annual investments as specified&#13;
in the terms of the concession but financed by the Government (except for&#13;
Line A). Line A investments are to be financed and undertaken by the&#13;
Government.&#13;
Financial             Net monthly subsidy/fee payments defined for each service corridor for the&#13;
Performance           entire concession period.&#13;
Source: World Bank, 1996, Argenna- Transport Pnvatizaton and Regulaton: The Next Wave of Chalenges, op. cit.&#13;
2.10           The Govemment accepted from the start that public financing would be required to&#13;
operate passenger rail services and undertake the investments needed to rehabilitate the system. For&#13;
each corridor the Govemment defined both maximum fares and minimum service frequencies. The latter&#13;
were defined in terms of rail cars per hour for each 24-hour service cycle and for each day of the week.&#13;
In addition, service quality standards were defined for each corridor, including percentage of on-time&#13;
trains and percentage of canceled trains. If concessionaires reached or surpassed these service&#13;
standards, they would be entitled to increase tariffs beyond authorized maximum levels, as a&#13;
performance incentive. Chronic failure to comply with service standards could result in specific penalties.&#13;
The rehabilitation of subway Line A was left out of the concession process due to legal problems. An Italian firm had already signed&#13;
a contract to rehabilitate Line A, but irregularities sent the involved parties to arbitration. (In the end, the case was decided In the&#13;
Govemmenfs hfvor and the planned works were not carried out). While the rehabilitation of Line A had to be excluded from the&#13;
subway and Urquiza concession, the tender documents and subsequently the concession agreement between the Government and&#13;
the concessionaire committed the Government to separately rehabilitate Line A by December 1997, in addition to its other&#13;
obligations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
2.11          According to the terms of the concessions, the Govemment was to own the rolling stock&#13;
and infrastructure, all of which would be assigned to the concessionaire. The concessionaire would have&#13;
full responsibility for all rail activities, ranging from marketing to maintenance of rolling stock and&#13;
infrastructure. A key design feature in concessioning the suburban railways and the subway was that a&#13;
monthly payment (combining operating subsidies and investments for the rehabilitation program) was to&#13;
be made to the successful bidder for each service corridor over the entire terms of the concession&#13;
contract. The schedule of monthly payments, adjusted for inflation, was negotiated Lip-front,"before the&#13;
concession was awarded.&#13;
2.12          Concessionaires assumed the risks inherent in most business activities. For example, if&#13;
actual ridership (and revenues) exceeded estimates, incremental net income accrued to the&#13;
concessionaires. If, on the contrary, actual numbers proved lower than estimates made at the time the&#13;
contract was finalized, concessionaires absorbed the resulting loss and were not entitled to additional&#13;
subsidy. The same principle applied to operating expenses. Cost savings would accrue to the benefit of&#13;
concessionaires and cost overruns to their detriment. Concessionaires, however, could not attain lower&#13;
costs by compromising the levels of service to which they were contractually committed. Concession&#13;
contracts included several mandatory service standards, such as number of cars to be dispatched per&#13;
hour, maximum allowable canceled and delayed trains, and equipment maintenance and availability&#13;
standards. In fact, concessionaires had a strong incentive to exceed these service standards. Only then&#13;
could they claim a fare increase.&#13;
2.13          The characteristics of the successful bids for each railway package are summarized in&#13;
Table 2.2. The calls for bids were staggered; first, the Mitre, Sarmiento and Urquiza/Subway; second, the&#13;
Roca and San Martin lines; and finally the Belgrano Norte and Belgrano Sur lines. On January 31, 1992,&#13;
seven consortia consisting of 114 local and foreign companies submitted qualifying bids. Construction&#13;
firms with no previous railway operating experience were the most prevalent bidders. Companies with&#13;
rail operating experience accounted for only 26 percent of those who bid. In all winning consortia there&#13;
was a significant participation of private bus companies or groups associated with them.&#13;

2.14          By the end of 1992, three consortia were selected for the seven service packages:&#13;
Metrovias for the concession of Mitre, Sarmiento, and Urquiza/Subway; Trainmet for Roca, San Martin,&#13;
and Belgrano Sur; and Feffovias for Belgrano Norte. The investors for Metrovias later on divided&#13;
themselves into two groups, Metrovias and Trenes de Buenos Aires (TBA) responsible for the&#13;
Urquiza/Subway and Mitre/Sarmiento concessions respectively. The total amount of Govemment&#13;
payment requested by the winning consortia amounts to about US$1 billion (June 1992 USS value). Most&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
of this amount is intended for capital investment, as opposed to the Government subsidies before&#13;
privatization which mostly financed operational deficits. The real estate assets necessary for the&#13;
operation of the concessions (e.g., platforms, ticketing, etc.) were transferred to the concessionaires. All&#13;
other assets remained with FEMESA who became custodian of these assets until their final disposed.&#13;
FEMESA is exploring a number of possibilities, including expanding the use of these assets through the&#13;
involvement of the private sector to construct shopping malls similar to Union Station in Washington,&#13;
transfer stations, etc.&#13;
C. Initial Benefits of Concessioning Urban Rail Services&#13;
2.15          The concessioning process for the suburban railway system  and the subway which&#13;
started in October 1991 finally concluded on May 27, 1995 with the transfer of the Mitre and Sarmiento&#13;
lines to TBA. Based on the performance of the concessions so far, they are generally considered to be a&#13;
huge success. Recent data for the revenue passengers carried indicate an impressive growth rate over&#13;
the last three years. An important reason for this immediate improvement has been the anti-fare evasion&#13;
measures adopted by all private operations. However, even in the case of the subway where fare&#13;
evasion was a relatively minor problem, 1996 ridership was up by 37 percent compared to 1993, the last&#13;
year before its concession. The traffic gains have also been fostered by the improvements in service&#13;
reliability and security, particularly at stations. Other service indicators, such as punctuality, interruptions&#13;
and cancellations, also show major improvement. A survey conducted for the Government in early 1995&#13;
found that 96 percent of the travelers on four suburban lines felt the service was as good or better than&#13;
before, with a majority stating that it was better. Furthermore, unlike other privatizations, railway&#13;
consumers did not have to pay higher prices for this quality improvement.&#13;

2.16          From  the Govemment's financial perspective, the implications of the restructuring&#13;
process can be evaluated based on a comparison of the total subsidies in the concession contracts with&#13;
the actual deficits before restructuring. The operating deficit of the suburban railway in 1993 alone was&#13;
estimated to be US$465 million. Additionally, the subway was losing US$40 million per year. In&#13;
comparison, the Government payment required to operate all the systems over the life of the&#13;
concessions amounts to US$680 million in present value terms (in 1992 US$). The main portion of this&#13;
payment (US$560 million) goes toward capital improvement for rolling stock, track, communications,&#13;
signaling systems, and stations, and only US$120 million represents an operating subsidy. At the end of&#13;
the concession period (20 years for the subway and Urquiza, and 10 years for the other lines), the&#13;
Government is expected to have saved US$5.5 billion in payments and in the process have acquired an&#13;
improved and well-functioning passenger railway system.&#13;
2.17          Another benefit of the restructuring process has been a reduction in the economic costs&#13;
of operation, mainly through increased labor productivity and more efficient use of capital. FEMESA, at&#13;
its creation in 1991, employed about 16,000 people to carry a volume of 209 million paying passengers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
In 1996, the suburban railways carried 413 million passengers with about 8,400 employees. Thus, labor&#13;
productivity increased nearly four-fold: from 13,000 passengers per employee to 49,000 passengers per&#13;
employee.&#13;
D. Regulatory Issues&#13;
2.18         The Government's early attempt to create a regulatory agency (ATAM) to oversee urban&#13;
transport in the AMBA, including the railways, did not materialize. In practice, the concessions are&#13;
regulated by the Unidad de Coordinaci6n del Programa de Restructuracion Ferroviana (UCPF) of the&#13;
SOPyT, which had been responsible for the design and implementation of the concession process. The&#13;
main role of the UCPF is to enforce the terms of the contract and to monitor and certify the progress of&#13;
the government-financed investment program. The ultimate authority regarding contractual and tariff&#13;
changes rest with the Minister of Economy. Since the concession contracts restrict the ability of the&#13;
concessionaire to raise tariffs and require minimum service standards, the approach not only provides&#13;
simplicity from the perspective of regulation but also provides a strong incentive for the concessionaires&#13;
to increase ridership.&#13;
2.19         As the concession process has matured, several issues have arisen which were not&#13;
foreseen due to the pioneering nature of the process. The growth in ridership has been beyond expected&#13;
levels, and there is little provision in the existing contracts to accommodate this rapid growth in traffic.&#13;
The investments are fixed in time and can only be brought forward at the concessionaire's expense.&#13;
Since the concessionaires do not own the assets, they find it difficult to obtain financial resources within&#13;
the short time frame of the concessions. Since the ridership pattern changed, there is a need to modify&#13;
the govemment-financed investment program to undertake more efficient investments in response to&#13;
increasing ridership. To address these problems, the bicameral commission of Congress responsible for&#13;
overseeing the nation's privatization process gave the Government permission in April 1996 to re-&#13;
negotiate the contracts with private concessionaires to allow for a change in the terms of the contract as&#13;
well as to extend the length of the contract. TBA, the concessionaire for Mitre and Sarmiento lines,&#13;
already has prepared an ambitious program of investment equivalent to US$900 million, which would&#13;
completely revamp its network with new cars, electrification, signaling, communications and elimination&#13;
of at-grade road/rail crossings.&#13;
2.20         Another issue is the inability of the Government to meet some of the conditions in the&#13;
concession contract in a timely manner. The delays stem from higher-than-expected ridership, worse-&#13;
than-expected condition of the rolling stock and facilities, and a lack of funding for the rehabilitation of&#13;
Line A. While the proposed project would help alleviate some of the delays, there is still the issue of the&#13;
extent to which the concessionaires should be compensated for these delays. In the case of the so-called&#13;
"automatic tariff increases" that are triggered by changes in the cost of service, delays are common and&#13;
there is no clarity on the compensation to the concessionaire for the delays in payment due to the time it&#13;
takes the Govemment to institute the changes in the contract to permit a tariff or subsidy increase.&#13;
E. The Metrovias Concession&#13;
2.21         The original Metrovias consortium was selected for the subway/Urquiza, Mitre, and&#13;
Sarmiento concessions which together account for over 50 percent of all metropolitan rail passengers. Its&#13;
owners were a large construction company (Benito Roggio y Asociados, 33.33 percent), a consortium of&#13;
bus operators (Cometrans, 30.33 percent), a rolling stock manufacturer (Morrison Knudsen Argentina&#13;
S.A., 16.67 percent), a foreign operator (Burlington Northem, 16.37 percent), and a small construction&#13;
firm (SKS, 3.00 percent). During the final stages of contract negotiations for the Mitre and Sarmiento&#13;
concessions, Cometrans, Morrison Knudsen and Burlington Northern formed the new consortium Trenes&#13;
de Buenos Aires (TBA) and released some of their shares in Metrovias to Benito Roggio. Likewise,&#13;
Benito Roggio transferred its interest in Mitre and Sarmiento to Cometrans. Metrovias is now majority&#13;
owned by Benito Roggio y Asociados with small participation from Cometrans and others.&#13;
2.22         The concession held by Metrovias for the Buenos Aires subway and the Urquiza line&#13;
began on January 1, 1994. This concession differs from other passenger railway concessions in that it is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-11-&#13;
for a period of 20 years instead of 10. The increased length of the concession was based on the amount&#13;
of the investment program (US$493 million plus about US$120 million for Line A), and Includes some&#13;
technological change. Under the contract, Metrovias will receive decreasing operational subsidies for the&#13;
first five years of the concession (until 1998). Starting in 1999, it will begin making payments (fees or&#13;
canon) to the Govemment which increase every year until the termination of the concession in 2013.&#13;
2.23           Over the 20-year life of the concession, Metrovias will pay the Govemment about US$26&#13;
million for the concession and receive about US$208 million in Govemment payments for undertaking&#13;
the specified investment program6. In addition, the Govemment will provide about US$120 million worth&#13;
of improvements in Line A. This is advantageous to the Govemment, considering that in 1993 alone the&#13;
subway and the Urquiza line incurred an operational deficit of US$54 million. Metrovias' offer was based&#13;
on an expected increase in traffic of 60 percent over the length of the concession compared to 1993. In&#13;
the same period, expenses were projected to decrease by 36 percent.&#13;
2.24           Given that the concession has now been under private operation for more than three&#13;
years, a clearer understanding of its results is available. Prior to the takeover, traffic on the Urquiza line&#13;
was declining at a rate of 4.7 percent per year; the decline in the subway was 2.7 percent per year. By&#13;
1996, ridership on the subway had increased by 37 percent compared to 1993; on the Urquiza line it was&#13;
up by 47 percent during the same period. By the end of 1996, the subway traffic had surpassed year&#13;
eight forecast for the traffic as included in the concession documents (see Chart 2.1). On the other hand,&#13;
ridership on the Urquiza line grew slightly less than expected during this period. Nonetheless, Metrovias&#13;
total revenues were up by more than US$20 million in 1995 compared to the projections in the&#13;
concession contract.&#13;

III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
3.1          The Project's objectives would be to: (a) support the private-public partnership in&#13;
improving the service quality and coverage of mass transit; (b) support the infrastructure improvements&#13;
defined in the concession agreement between the Govemment and the private sector; (c) assist in&#13;
improving the conditions of traffic safety and environmental quality; and (d) help in developing an&#13;
integrated urban transport (road and rail) system for the AMBA.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
3.2          The project would comprise a package of actions and investments aimed at the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a)   finance the rail equipment and infrastructure which are critical for the upgrading of public&#13;
transport services;&#13;
(b)   promote the integration of the transport system by upgrading transfer stations among rail&#13;
lines, building better transfer facilities between rail and road-based transport, and&#13;
generally improving road access to rail stations;&#13;
(c)   improve traffic safety and environmental conditions through the construction of grade&#13;
separations at high-volume crossings, the enhancement of controls at road/rail grade&#13;
crossings, the development of a complementary program of road safety actions, and the&#13;
introduction of systematic air pollution monitoring; and&#13;
(d)   strengthen the institutional framework which would ensure the continued operation of an&#13;
economically and environmentally sustainable transport system in the metropolitan area.&#13;
3.3          The proposed works, goods acquisition and technical assistance have been grouped into&#13;
the following five subprojects:&#13;
(a)    support of the basic investment program of the Metrovias concession (36 percent of total&#13;
project costs net of project administration);&#13;
(b)   rehabilitation of subway Line A (31 percent);&#13;
(c)   integration of the transport system (9 percent);&#13;
(d)    environmental monitoring and traffic safety program, including road/rail grade&#13;
separations (16 percent); and&#13;
(e)    strengthening of the institutional framework (8 percent).&#13;
3.4          Basic Investment Program  of the Metrovias Concession: The 1992 tender&#13;
documents for the subway/Urquiza concession included a detailed investment program, which is now&#13;
part of the Govemment's concession agreement with Metrovias. A $142.9 million slice (about three&#13;
years, 1997-1999) of that program would be considered part of the project; $50 million of this would be&#13;
funded from the World Bank loan. In accordance with Article 3.13(a) of the procurement guidelines,&#13;
works and goods required for the basic investment program would be procured by Metrovias, using its&#13;
own procedures.&#13;
3.5          The specific improvements would include: Rehabilitation of subway Lines B, C, D and E,&#13;
including: (a) partial track renewal; (b) renovation of electric substations and transmission systems; (c)&#13;
automatic signals and operations control center; (d) station improvements and the rebuilding of&#13;
escalators; (e) workshop improvements; and (f) renewal of ventilation and drainage systems. Slightly&#13;
over 10 percent of the total would be for similar improvements on the Urquiza line.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
3.6          Rehabilitation of Subway Line A. This subproject would include the complete renewal&#13;
of track, three new electric substations, renewal of the power transmission system, renovation of the&#13;
signal and communications system, installation of a new control center, replacement of drainage pumps,&#13;
new ventilation systems, renewal of station escalators, and the integration of the existing Lima and&#13;
Piedras stations at a location which would greatly improve transfer conditions with subway Line C. These&#13;
works would be grouped into five contracts for (a) track renewal; (b) other civil works; (c) electrical&#13;
equipment; (d) signals and communications; and (e) expansion of the traffic control center.&#13;
3.7          Integration of the Transport System. This subproject has been defined as a sectoral&#13;
program. The specific criteria and procedures, including those related to environmental assessment and&#13;
consultation with neighboring communities and businesses, are currently being defined and will be&#13;
contained in an Operational Manual, the approval of which would be a condition for civil works&#13;
disbursements under this subproject.&#13;
3.8          The subproject would complement civil works at transfer stations which have already&#13;
been agreed under the concession agreement. It would include the works and actions detailed below,&#13;
which aim to achieve better synergy among the existing rail and road-based services.&#13;
(a)    Transfer centers at or near major rail stations where transfer conditions for public&#13;
transport passengers would be greatly improved through the incorporation of off-street&#13;
bus terminals, pedestrian facilities, car parks, and drop-off areas. Preliminary analyses&#13;
have been carried out for an initial 14 locations, identifying the main issues and&#13;
recommending improvements. Feasibility studies are underway, including preliminary&#13;
cost estimates and the preparation of traffic circulation plans. It is expected that, by loan&#13;
effectiveness, preliminary engineering will be completed for eight stations; final designs&#13;
and bidding documents will be prepared thereafter.&#13;
(b)    Improvements near outlying rail stations to ease the access for buses, pedestrians, cars&#13;
and/or bicycles. These would largely consist of road and traffic engineering&#13;
improvements, such as bus priorities, traffic signals, geometric changes to provide space&#13;
for passenger drop-offs or to correct traffic bottlenecks near the station, walkways,&#13;
sidewalk improvements and bicycle facilities. Such schemes would be designed by&#13;
SOPyT and be implemented in close collaboration with the municipalities concemed.&#13;
(c)    Some station improvements would include secure facilities for bicycle parking. In this&#13;
regard, a promotional program would be developed to encourage bicycle access to&#13;
outlying railway stations. Increased bicycle use at these locations is expected to raise rail&#13;
ridership as the area of influence of those stations would be expanded and benefit some&#13;
low-income rail customers who could save the additional fares needed for feeder bus&#13;
services.&#13;
(d)    Other station improvements, especially where improved transfer conditions between two&#13;
rail lines or between rail and road-based transport would yield significant benefits to&#13;
passengers and thus make mass transit more attractive.&#13;
3.9          Environmental Monitoring and Traffic Safety Program. This subproject would&#13;
combine the initiation of air pollution monitoring with an action plan that SOPyT has defined to reduce&#13;
the high number of traffic accidents at road/rail crossings. The air pollution monitoring component is&#13;
described in Annex J. With regard to the traffic safety program, environmental assessments and public&#13;
participation exercises were carried out for two proposed road/rail grade separations, selected from an&#13;
initial list of 20 schemes on the basis of economic retum. This experience is being incorporated an&#13;
Operational Manual, the approval of which would be a condition for civil works disbursements under this&#13;
subproject; it would include the following components:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
(a)    construction of ten to twelve grade-separated road crossings over/under suburban&#13;
railway lines;&#13;
(b)    development of a comprehensive strategy to improve the safety at grade crossings&#13;
between the road and the rail systems on the basis of a study to be funded under the&#13;
project; and&#13;
(c)    improvements to the system of barrier-controlled road/rail crossings.&#13;
3.10          Strengthening of the Institutional Framework. A key element of the overall project&#13;
would be the strengthening of coordinated transport planning at the metropolitan level, and support for&#13;
the creation of a Transport Planning Unit which would be responsible for the formulation of common&#13;
policies on pricing, financing, project evaluation and selection. It would also aim to develop policies&#13;
which improve cost recovery and increase the long-term financial sustainability of the operating agencies&#13;
involved. The activities below would be included.&#13;
(a)    Preparation of a transport model suitable for testing altemative transport investments,&#13;
rail integration projects, bus route franchising options, tariff policies, and street&#13;
congestion pricing. The last comprehensive survey of travel characteristics was carried&#13;
out more than 25 years ago, and is no longer a useful basis for investment and policy&#13;
decisions regarding transport in Greater Buenos Aires. Numerous and often contradictory&#13;
proposals are being promoted by various agencies and interests to extend the subway&#13;
system, upgrade suburban railways beyond the scope currently envisaged in the&#13;
concessions, and to further enlarge the system of urban motorways. The proposed&#13;
transport survey and model would establish a sound footing on which the feasibility and&#13;
relative priorities of these (and other) proposals can be determined on a quantified basis.&#13;
The study, to be conducted by a consulting firm jointly with a govemment team forming&#13;
the nucieus of a permanent transport planning unit (see (d) below), would receive&#13;
guidance from a steering committee which would be composed of representatives of key&#13;
agencies responsible for metropolitan transport and road planning and management.&#13;
(b)    Formulation of a program to improve the city's traffic and street environment, which&#13;
could include such aspects as: (i) updating of the street hierarchy, especially in the&#13;
micro-center where through traffic, buses, trucks, and pedestrians could be better&#13;
separated; (ii) definition of a traffic calming program for selected streets or areas; (iii)&#13;
consideration of area-wide traffic demand management through regulatory, pricing&#13;
and/or physical measures; and (iv) improvement of pedestrian facilities, such as&#13;
additional pedestrian streets, sidewalk widening and repairs, and better refuges, signals,&#13;
and markings at intersections.&#13;
(c)    Technical assistance to SOPyT to provide advice on technical, financial, environmental,&#13;
and social aspects during project execution.&#13;
(d)    Establishment of a Transport Planning Unit (TUAMBA), funded by the Govemment and&#13;
primarily consisting of personnel previously working for the Pre-ATAM, which would&#13;
initially constitute the counterpart staff of the transport study consultants and, after the&#13;
study's conclusion, be responsible for continued transport planning in the metropolitan&#13;
area.&#13;
(e)    Training to professionals of the national, provincial and municipal govemments in such&#13;
fields as urban transport planning and economics, environmental management, and&#13;
especially traffic engineering and traffic safety management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. Project Costs and Financing&#13;
3.11       While the Line A rehabilitation consists of a number of dearly defined works with a distinct&#13;
cost estimate (US$81.9 million net of contingencies and taxes), the other project components are&#13;
ongoing or future programs which would be supported under the proposed World Bank loan. This permits&#13;
a certain degree of flexibility in defining the size and financing of individual project components, taking&#13;
account of the following fixed points:&#13;
(a)    the proposed loan would total US$200 million, of which US$50 million would be allocated&#13;
to the basic investment program of the Metrovias concession; and&#13;
(b)    the Govemment would provide counterpart funding in an amount equal to the Bank loan.&#13;
3.12       The following cost table presents the overall project financing plan, which was confirmed at&#13;
negotiations.&#13;

fixed price, and 10 percent for all others. Price contingencies amount to 2.3 percent per year. Base costs&#13;
are expressed in December 1996 prices.&#13;
D. Project Risks and Benefits&#13;
3.14          Risks. To some degree, the usual risks associated with investment projects-cost and&#13;
time overruns-apply to this project. They are partly offset, however, by the fact that the largest&#13;
component (Metrovias concession) is already being implemented on the basis of agreed prices laid down&#13;
in the concession agreement.&#13;
3.15          The investment is in well-known technology, available from  many sources. Little&#13;
technological risk is therefore involved. Commercially, the contractually agreed fixed terms of&#13;
remuneration for the concessionaire shift any financial risk associated with the basic investment program&#13;
of Metrovias to the concessionaire. The risks thus become the risks of the concession failing. Three main&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
reasons may be suggested for failure of the concession, namely: (a) financial failure of the&#13;
concessionaire due to commercial eventualities; (b) failure due to default by the Govemment on its&#13;
payment obligations; and (c) withdrawal of the concessionaire from the concession agreement for&#13;
reasons other than direct financial failure.&#13;
3.16         In respect of the financial viability of the concession, the evidence available so far&#13;
indicates that traffic and revenue are substantially higher than anticipated. There is also some anecdotal&#13;
evidence that concessionaires are obtaining supplies at prices lower than those anticipated in their&#13;
concession bids. The increase in aggregate costs being quoted appears to be primarily related to&#13;
increased quantity of service supplied. Given the growing passenger demand for rail transport in Buenos&#13;
Aires, the risk of direct financial failure appears small.&#13;
3.17         In respect of Govemment default on its obligations, there is also no immediate reason to&#13;
view the risk as high. The National Govemment has so far made payments to all the rail concessionaires&#13;
fully and on time. The most significant problem was the fact that the Line A rehabilitation would not be&#13;
completed by December 1997, the deadline provided for in the concession contract. However, because&#13;
of the inclusion of that component in the project, a modification of the concession agreement was signed&#13;
on January 22, 1997, which indicates June 1999 as the new estimated completion date for the Line A&#13;
rehabilitation.&#13;
3.18         A less direct risk of the contract being upset may be associated with the changing&#13;
political status and management of the Municipality of the City of Buenos Aires (MCBA). Although the&#13;
concession contract for the subway is between the concessionaire and the National Govemment, the&#13;
subway is formally owned by the Municipality. Last year's move to local democratic election of the&#13;
mayor, in place of direct appointment by the National Govemment, opens up the possibility that the&#13;
management of the subway could become a direct political issue. If, for example, responsibility for public&#13;
transport fare control were to pass to the Municipality of Buenos Aires (as is formally the case for the&#13;
municipalities within the Province of Buenos Aires), there would be a possibility that the Municipality&#13;
might introduce fare constraints or policies which undermine the contract. Even in the event of such a&#13;
transfer of responsibility, however, it seems unlikely that the Municipality would wish to undermine the&#13;
concession so long as the financing of the concession remains a National Govemment responsibility and&#13;
the average subway tariff remains below the bus tariff. Maintaining this responsibility thus seems to be&#13;
the best way of mitigating this risk.&#13;
3.19         The risk of the investment being invalidated due to the concessionaire voluntarily&#13;
abandoning the concession concems the possibility that, at some early stage of the concession, before&#13;
the present value of the contract to the Govemment had become positive, the concessionaire would find&#13;
it more attractive to withdraw than to remain in the concession. In practice, the phasing of the financial&#13;
flows under the concession contract are such that at all times during the life of the concession the&#13;
present value of the payments under the concession is less than expected Govemment payments&#13;
without the concession. In the event of termination of the concession the investment would revert to the&#13;
Govemment. The Govemment would then have enjoyed a positive value of financial flows during the&#13;
concession, and a higher capital stock at the termination of the concession than would have occurred&#13;
without the concession. Experience with other rail companies suggests that it would also then be possible&#13;
for the Govemment to relet the concession to mutual advantage. Regardless, the investment program&#13;
under the concession mainly materializes towards the middle to later part of the concession period, thus&#13;
making it unlikely for the concessionaire to walk away from the concession after reaping the profits from&#13;
the investment phase of the concession.&#13;
3.20         Benefits. Quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits are expected from the proposed&#13;
project, including cost savings, time savings for the users, and fewer accidents and fatalities. By&#13;
supporting private sector participation in Argentina's railways, the proposed project would decrease the&#13;
financial burden on the Govemment. In addition, there would be a positive environmental impact through&#13;
the reduction of fossil fuel consumption and motor-vehicle related emissions, the introduction of an air&#13;
pollution monitoring system, and the reduction in road congestion with a consequent improvement in air&#13;
quality and noise pollution.&#13;

E. Economic Evaluation&#13;
3.21         The Subway Investments. The concession awarded to Metrovias involved the&#13;
rehabilitation and operation, over a period of 20 years, of the subway network and the Urquiza suburban&#13;
railway which connects with it. One of the terms of the concession was that Line A of the subway was to&#13;
be rehabilitated on the Govemment's account. The present project consists of the investments necessary&#13;
for the Govemment to meet that obligation. If the investment were not to be made, the whole concession&#13;
would be at risk. Economic evaluation was thus applied both to the concession as a whole and to the&#13;
Line A rehabilitation Itself.&#13;
3.22         The basic assumption made in the appraisal of the concession is that, without the&#13;
concession, the subway would continue to run at the initial level of service, with annual expenditures by&#13;
Govemment equal to those made in the final year before concessioning. This is treated as the "do-&#13;
nothing" case. In the year prior to concessioning the subway carried 145 million passengers and required&#13;
US$40 million in operating subsidy. In addition, the Urquiza line, with which the subway is linked in the&#13;
concession, was losing over US$11 million a year, giving a total cost to Govemment of US$51 million. It&#13;
has been assumed that these losses would continue in the absence of the concession.&#13;
3.23         In the years before concessioning, the cost to Govemment had been increasing, while&#13;
the level of service and of patronage had been declining. Moreover, maintenance expenditures were&#13;
being deferred so that the likely future expenditures to keep the system in operation would have had to&#13;
increase in any event. In the case of Line A, the oldest line, it is estimated that inability to maintain&#13;
obsolete equipment would have led to closure within five years. The "constant cost to Govemment"&#13;
assumption for the status quo is thus very conservative.&#13;
3.24         The net present value of the stream of payments by Govemment on the assumption of&#13;
constant subsidy in the absence of the concession agreement amounts to US$401 million at a 12 percent&#13;
discount rate. The stream of payments under the concession (adding together operating subsidies,&#13;
capital expenditures and the fees payable by Metrovias) has a net present value of US$162 million. The&#13;
net benefit in present value terms is thus estimated to be US$239 million (see Annex G).&#13;
3.25         There are three logical limitations to relying solely on the financial evaluations of the&#13;
concession. The first is if there are external disbenefits of the concession, the overall social benefit of the&#13;
concession might be negative notwithstanding a financial benefit for the Govemment. The second is that&#13;
even in the context of a successful concession, it would not be desirable for the Bank to finance a&#13;
specific investment which was not economically viable. The third is that there might be a possibility to&#13;
retain the overall concession benefits by substituting some alternative investment program mutually&#13;
acceptable to the Govemment and the concessionaires. All three of these issues are addressed through&#13;
an economic evaluation of the Line A rehabilitation investment itself (see below).&#13;
3.26         Line A. The evaluation procedure used is a conventional cost-benefit analysis in which&#13;
the level and performance of traffic in the affected network is estimated with and without the investment&#13;
under consideration over the effective life of the project (taken in this instance to be the 20 years of the&#13;
concession). The basic calculation only covered a single direction of traffic-outward along Avenida&#13;
Rivadavia. The total benefits of the project should be at least double this because the inward joumey in&#13;
the corridor is forced to use parallel streets of lower capacity, for which exclusive bus lanes to improve&#13;
performance are not feasible.&#13;
3.27         The assumptions of this appraisal were that without investment, Line A would collapse&#13;
after a period of five years (some sensitivity tests were undertaken to allow for a longer period before&#13;
total collapse). With the abandonment of service on the line, the traffic would be carried predominantly&#13;
by public bus service. Given the limited road capacity in the Line A corridor (Avenida Rivadavia) this&#13;
would involve slower joumey times for those transferred from subway to bus, increased costs of bus&#13;
operation, and increased joumey time for private transport travelers in the corridor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
3.28         The economic evaluation considered a number of altematives, with and without the&#13;
proposed project to determine the correct level of investment and "project".  Even though the&#13;
rehabilitation of Line A was thought to be the optimal project, other complementary investments were&#13;
considered on Avenida Rivadavia where it is possible to introduce an exclusive bus lane, regardless of&#13;
whether Line A is closed.&#13;
3.29         Because the bus lane improves traffic flow in any event, the effect of introducing it&#13;
reduces the calculated rate of return on keeping the Line A open. A range of altematives for the bus&#13;
lane, both with and without the subway, were considered. The calculated NPV for one-direction&#13;
movement along Rivadavia only, varies between US$334 million (assuming no bus lane either with or&#13;
without the subway) and US$168 million (assuming that an exclusive bus lane was introduced over the&#13;
whole route whether or not the subway was maintained in operation). The results of the investigation&#13;
demonstrate that the altemative project (implementing a bus lane) would still be beneficial even if Line A&#13;
was rehabilitated. The Line A project, however, is shown to be superior to the altemative (bus lane) since&#13;
the NPV, calculated for the project compared to the without situation that includes a full bus lane, is&#13;
higher than the NPV obtained for just introducing the bus lane.&#13;
3.30         Assuming that inbound traffic would generate at least the same benefits as the outbound&#13;
traffic on Rivadavia (actually the benefits will be more because there is no good altemative on the&#13;
parallel streets for retuming traffic), net benefits in present value terms exceed any other possible&#13;
altemative by at least US$340 million. It is worth noting that these calculations exclude any evaluation of&#13;
environmental beneft associated with traffic taken by subway rather than by road vehicle. They are,&#13;
therefore, extremely robust for the Line A investment.&#13;
3.31         Grade Separations. A detailed scheme of economic evaluation has also been&#13;
established for the proposed road/rail grade separations. This evaluation procedure calculates time and&#13;
operating cost savings for road and rail operators and passengers, as well as accident cost savings. The&#13;
calculations also include the effects on both road and rail system users during the period of construction,&#13;
including those of reduced speed of rail operation and diversion of road traffic to other crossings in the&#13;
interim period. Details of the evaluation procedure are contained in Annex G.&#13;
3.32         The economic evaluations completed under these conventions adopted give intemal&#13;
economic rates of return in the range of 14 to 90 percent and NPV at 12 percent between US$0.68&#13;
million and US$24.82 million. However, the results are conservative due to the way in which accident&#13;
impacts are estimated (on the basis of averages unrelated to volumes of various traffics at the specific&#13;
sites) and evaluated (on the basis of lost future eamings associated with deaths and injuries). In addition,&#13;
the economic benefits resulting from higher rail frequency due to complete elimination of grade crossings&#13;
on the Roca line between Plaza Constituci6n and Temperley were also estimated to be about US$7&#13;
million per year starting in the third year of the completion of the grade separations (against a total&#13;
investment of US$9 million). Due to the rapid increase in ridership since the concessions were let, the&#13;
barrier down-times have exceeded those stipulated in the concession agreements. This means that the&#13;
impact of site-specific traffic conflicts is likely to be under-represented, and that the level of rates of&#13;
return is thus likely to be underestimated.&#13;
F. Financial Evaluation&#13;
3.33         Metrovias was awarded the concession following a competitive process which ranked the&#13;
bids on the basis of minimum net present value7 of the Govemment payments (operating subsidy and&#13;
capital investment) required to operate the system at a defined tariff and service level. Since tariffs are&#13;
fixed by the Govemment and cannot be changed by the concessionaire, the profitability of the business&#13;
depends on Metrovias' ability to lower its operating costs and to generate new traffic. In order to take into&#13;
account the effect of rising prices over the long concession period, the contract provides for an automatic&#13;
adjustment in the subsidy/tariff level (choice of the Govemment) based on an increase in the cost of&#13;
providing the contractual level of service.&#13;
7  Calculated at a discount rate of 12 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
3.34         Metrovias is a private company which holds a 20-year concession for operating the&#13;
Buenos Aires subway and the Urquiza line. According to the terms of concession, Metrovias is to receive&#13;
declining levels of operating subsidy during the first five years of its concession. During the next 15-year&#13;
period, Metrovias must make payments to the Govemment for the use of infrastructure on an increasing&#13;
basis. Over the life of the concession, Metrovias is to make payments equivalent to US$360 million and&#13;
receive from the Govemment US$65 million in operating subsidies8. In 1993, the year before Metrovias&#13;
took over the control of the system, the Government paid out US$54 million in operating subsidies for&#13;
the subway and the Urquiza line.&#13;
3.35         The financial and operating results for the first two years of private operations (Annex H),&#13;
1994-1995, show the concession to be a success thus far. Total revenues were up by about 25 percent in&#13;
each of the operating years. In 1996, total ridership was up by 37 percent over 1993. In fact, the level of&#13;
ridership attained in 1996 for the subway was equal to that of year eight (2001) of the proposal. On the&#13;
Urquiza line, passenger volumes in 1996 were 48 percent above the 1993 level. Total revenues in 1995&#13;
surpassed the forecast by about US$21 million. Metrovias also did well on non-operating revenue which,&#13;
in 1995, was more than double what was included in the concession proposal.&#13;
3.36         The high growth in ridership and the requirements for taking over the concession&#13;
increased the cost of providing the service. In 1995, labor costs of US$61 million were up by 14 percent&#13;
when compared to the projections. Similarly, energy costs also increased by about 40 percent during this&#13;
period. On the other hand, maintenance costs were nearly half of the projection. The biggest increase,&#13;
by about US$14 million, was in the expense category 'other expenses" which is probably used to&#13;
balance the difference between revenues and expenditures to the levels indicated in the concession&#13;
agreement. Based on the financial performance so far, there is very little likelihood that Metrovias would&#13;
abandon the concession.&#13;
G. Environmental Impact&#13;
3.37         The rapid increase in motorized traffic and an accompanying reduction in all public&#13;
transport modes, especially rail-based, has led to a deterioration in the urban environment due to an&#13;
increase in air and noise pollution and congestion. Although a favorable wind regime has helped to keep&#13;
air pollution relatively low in the AMBA, traffic fumes accumulate to unhealthy levels during working&#13;
hours in narrow, heavily traveled streets of the city center. While air pollution is primarily an inner city&#13;
problem for workers, shoppers and residents who are subject to vehicle pollution, other externalities such&#13;
as accidents, noise pollution and congestion are rampant problems in many parts of the metropolitan&#13;
region and have contributed to the degradation of urban space.&#13;
3.38         Unfortunately, a system to monitor the level of air pollution does not exist in Buenos&#13;
Aires. It is, therefore, difficult to develop effective policies and practices aimed at limiting pollution&#13;
without knowing the seriousness of the problem. As part of project preparation, an air quality and noise&#13;
monitoring program has been defined for Buenos Aires. The proposed project would support the&#13;
implementation of the recommended monitoring system, including procurement and installation of the&#13;
monitoring equipment and an associated training program at an approximate base cost of US$2 million&#13;
(see Annex J).&#13;
3.39         In the case of the traffic safety subproject, a preliminary environmental screening was&#13;
conducted for all proposed road/rail crossings (see Annex I). None of the proposed crossings was found&#13;
to have adverse environmental impacts. No residential resettlement is envisioned, neither for the traffic&#13;
safety nor for any of the other subprojects. However, the operational manuals for the traffic safety and&#13;
transport integration subprojects would set out the procedures to deal with impacts on commercial and&#13;
residential properties, in accordance with a declaration of principles contained in a Social and&#13;
Environmental Letter, which was agreed during loan negotiations and issued by SOPyT in March 1997.&#13;
Govemment payments required in this respect would be considered part of project costs (see Table 4.2).&#13;
8 These are contractual obligations which differ slightly from the Metrovias initial proposal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20-&#13;
Moreover, the institutional subproject would include technical assistance to provide advice on&#13;
environmental and social aspects of project execution, under terms of reference acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
3.40         Positive environmental impacts would result from a reduction in cars and bus traffic and&#13;
thus a reduction in air pollution, noise levels, traffic congestion, and road accidents. Other positive&#13;
impacts include the decrease of fatal accidents resulting from the construction of grade separations at&#13;
the most dangerous road/rail crossings.&#13;
H. Public Participation&#13;
3.41         The final designs for most transfer centers and road/rail grade separations would be&#13;
developed with the participation of the affected population. Summarized in paras. 6 and 7 of Annex I,&#13;
this process would be detailed in the operational manuals for these subprojects, taking account of a&#13;
successful pilot consultation exercise carried out prior to appraisal for one road/rail crossing site. With&#13;
regards to the road/rail crossing component, once the grade separations have been ranked according to&#13;
the selection criteria based on maximum economic rates of return, 10 - 12 crossings out of the total 20&#13;
studied would be presented to the affected communities as possible projects. If any crossings were to&#13;
require residential resettlement or otherwise face strong opposition by the affected communities, they&#13;
would be replaced by others on the list. On the other hand, if the communities were to object to the&#13;
design and not the crossing itself, the design details would be modified by the municipalities in&#13;
consultation with the affected population. Two aspects of design would be especially important: (a)&#13;
providing acceptable access to the properties adjoining the roads which lead to the underpasses below&#13;
the railway track; and (b) provision for the use of the crossing by pedestrians as well. To address the&#13;
former design issue, service roads would normally be provided adjacent to the underpass ramps. In the&#13;
latter case, pedestrian passages would need to be well-lighted, secure, and easily accessible in order to&#13;
maximize their utility. Similar criteria would apply to the transfer center component.&#13;

IV. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. Institutional Responsibilities&#13;
4.1          The Govemment of Argentina would be the Borrower. Metrovias would implement its&#13;
basic investment program in the same way as it currently does. The other components would be&#13;
implemented by SOPyT, which would also be responsible for overall project coordination. To this effect,&#13;
SOPyT would create a Project Implementation Unit (Unidad de Ejecuci6n del Proyecto - UEP) which&#13;
would report to the Subsecretary of  Table 4.1: Implementin A enc for Each Sub roect&#13;
Metropolitan  and  Long-Distance&#13;
Transport.  The  Bank  would                                                  Implementing&#13;

monitoring and supervision plan    Rehabilitation of Subway Line A                UEP&#13;
(Annex D).&#13;
Integration of Transport System                UEP&#13;
4.2          Project              Environmental Monitoring &amp; Traffic Safety Program  UEP&#13;
would be responsible for general    Strengthening of Institutional Framework      UEP&#13;
project coordination. It would act&#13;
as the liaison with the World Bank,&#13;
periodically update the work plan, coordinate all technical consultants, oversee procurement practices,&#13;
and act as the focal point for national, provincial and municipal interaction. It would be staffed by a&#13;
General Coordinator in charge of overall operations, a Technical Coordinator in charge of technical&#13;
analysis and assistance, a Project Works Coordinator responsible for the bidding, selection and award of&#13;
civil works subprojects, and an Administrative Coordinator in charge of the selection of consultants,&#13;
acquisition of goods, contracting of work, administration of project funds, and providing periodic progress&#13;
reports to the World Bank. The UEP would be established, and its coordinator named, shortly after loan&#13;
approval. The satisfactory functioning of the UEP would be a condition for loan effectiveness.&#13;
4.3          Metrovias. All the investments included in the concession contract are the responsibility&#13;
of Metrovias, which generally subcontracts the works to third parties. The National Govemment's SOPyT&#13;
provides independent oversight, certifies the amount of work finished each month, and authorizes&#13;
payments to Metrovias for completed work. The amounts for each part of the basic investment program&#13;
have been fixed in the concession contract, with a formula to adjust costs based on changes in the&#13;
Consumer Price Index of the United States.&#13;
B. Implementation Schedule&#13;
4.4          The loan is expected to be signed between June and August 1997. The Govemment&#13;
estimates that the project would be completed within four years after loan signing. Completion in four&#13;
years is possible if there are no delays. However, the bidding process for each bid may take from 7 to 12&#13;
months, including the approval of bidding documents, advertisement in the Development Business&#13;
joumal and local press, bid evaluation, recommendations for award, contract signature, and contract&#13;
effectiveness. The Bank thus estimates that seven years will be required for project completion; this&#13;
would be more realistic, taking into account the average disbursement profiles of Argentina and of the&#13;
Latin America and the Caribbean Region. Therefore, the expected project completion date is June 30,&#13;
2003 and the closing date is December 31, 2003.&#13;
4.5          The Bank's participation in financing Metrovias' basic investment program  would&#13;
terminate in about 1999, when the US$50 million allocated in the proposed loan is expected to have&#13;
been disbursed.&#13;
4.6          If the Govemment exercises the option of carrying out advanced contracting for Line A&#13;
and some road/rail crossings, the first contract could be tendered in June 1997 and contracts could be&#13;
signed in October 1997. Terms of Reference for the transport study and the rail barrier study could also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
be issued in June 1997, giving at least four months for consultant selection and contract signing before to&#13;
the loan becomes effective.&#13;
C. Procurement&#13;
4.7            Procurement would be in accordance with the Bank Guidelines for Procurement of&#13;
Goods and Works (January 1995, revised January and August 1996) and the Bank Guidelines for the&#13;
Use of Consultants (August 1981). Standard bidding documents issued by the Bank would be used for&#13;
the procurement of goods and works by International Competitive Bidding (ICB). The Bank-issued&#13;
standard contract for consultant services would be used for major consultants' contracts. In the case of&#13;
procurement under National Competitive Bidding (NCB), standard bidding documents agreed by the&#13;
Bank would be used, taking account of the recommendations of the recent Country Procurement&#13;
Assessment Review (May 1996). A General Procurement Notice was published on January 16, 1997.&#13;
The procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.2. All procurement aspects were confirmed&#13;
during negotiations.&#13;

4.8            Concession for Subway and Urquiza Line. The ROT (Rehabilitate-Operate-Transfer)&#13;
concession was tendered internationally in 1992 and awarded to Metrovias in 1993. The Bank carried out&#13;
a detailed evaluation of that process and concluded that the tendering and selection procedures satisfied&#13;
the Bank's criteria of transparency, efficiency and free access for potential bidders. Therefore, in&#13;
accordance with paragraph 3.13(a) of the procurement guidelines, goods and works specified in the basic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-23-&#13;
investment program of the Metrovias concession would be procured from eligible sources, using the&#13;
procedures of the concessionaire.&#13;
4.9          Rehabilitation of Subway Line A. In 1992 the Govemment expected to receive&#13;
bilateral funding (which later failed to materialize) for the rehabilitation of subway Line A. Thus the&#13;
concession tenders specified that the Govemment would separately carry out those works, outside the&#13;
basic investment program. Most of the rehabilitation works would be carried out under the proposed&#13;
project through four large contracts: (a) track replacement and associated civil works; (b) other civil&#13;
works; (c) signals and communications; and (d) electrical substations and associated works. The works&#13;
would be let by SOPyT as lump-sum ICB contracts, and their execution would be supervised by&#13;
consultants engaged by SOPyT. The role and collaboration of Metrovias was confirmed in an agreement&#13;
signed prior to loan negotiations. Shareholders of Metrovias would be eligible to participate in the bidding&#13;
for physical works, but could not at the same time be selected for construction supervision. In addition,&#13;
the expansion of the signal control center to accommodate Line A would be contracted directly with the&#13;
firm that Is currently assembling the control center for the other subway lines. Direct contracting (for&#13;
about US$1.2 million) is necessary to achieve technical uniformity within the control center.&#13;
4.10         Other Components. SOPyT would let about twenty contracts between US$2 and&#13;
US$10 million to build grade separations at road/rail crossings and to build transfer centers. In addition,&#13;
there would be relatively minor works and equipment acquisition under the project. Procurement&#13;
procedures for these would be as follows:&#13;
(a)    contracts for goods estimated to cost US$350,000 equivalent or more, and&#13;
contracts for works estimated to cost US$8 million equivalent or more, would be&#13;
procured through ICB procedures in accordance with Bank guidelines;&#13;
(b)    contracts for goods estimated to cost between US$100,000 and US$350,000,&#13;
and contracts for works estimated to cost between US$350,000 and US$8&#13;
million would be awarded through NCB procedures. Standard NCB documents&#13;
acceptable to the Bank would be included in the operational manuals prepared&#13;
for the road/rail crossing and transport systems integration components; and&#13;
(c)    contracts for goods estimated to cost US$100,000 or less would be procured&#13;
through local or international shopping, up to an aggregate amount of US$1&#13;
million; civil works costing US$350,000 or less, up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$2 million, would be procured under lump-sum contracts awarded on the&#13;
basis of quotations obtained from at least three qualified contractors in response&#13;
to written invitations.&#13;
4.11         Procurement Review. All contracts for goods estimated to cost the equivalent of&#13;
US$350,000 or more, and all contracts for works estimated to cost the equivalent of US$8 million or&#13;
more, would be subject to the Bank's prior review of the procurement documentation (advertising,&#13;
bidding documents, bid evaluation, and contract award). The first two NCB contracts for goods and the&#13;
first two NCB contracts for works would also be subject to the Bank's prior review. For consultants&#13;
services, all terms of reference would be subject to the Bank's prior review. Subject also to the Bank's&#13;
prior review would be all consulting firm contracts above US$100,000, all consulting firm contracts&#13;
selected on a sole-source basis, and all contracts with individual consultants above US$50,000. The&#13;
thresholds for the Bank's prior review are shown in Table 4.3.&#13;

D. Disbursements and Special Account&#13;
4.12          The bulk of the proceeds of the proposed loan, primarily related to Line A and the&#13;
Metrovias concession, are expected to be disbursed over a period of four years. Another three years&#13;
would be required to disburse the rest of the loan proceeds especially for traffic safety, transport&#13;
integration, and institutional development components. The disbursement period, equal to the average&#13;
seven-year profile for Latin America, was determined after taking into account: (a) contractual obligations&#13;
of the Government to undertake the railway-related investments according to a specified schedule; and&#13;
(b) ability to use §3.13a of Bank procurement guidelines for contracts covered under the Metrovias&#13;
concession (Basic Investment Program).&#13;

goods. All other disbursemeiets would be made on the basis of Statements of Expenditures (SOE)&#13;
certified by the UEP. Relevant documentation in support of SOEs would not be submitted to the Bank,&#13;
but would be retained by the UEP for the review of Bank supervision missions.&#13;
4.14          The payment for works completed&#13;
under Category A would be made pan passu with       Certification and Payment Process&#13;
the Govemment on the basis of work certificates  1. The concessionaire seeks the approval of SOPyT&#13;
(Certificados de Obra), issued by the SOPyT. For  to begin the agreed work by submitting Acta de&#13;
all other categories, disbursements would be made  Comienzo, which includes details of the&#13;

was reviewed and found satisfactory.           2. A SOPyT inspector is permanently assigned to the&#13;
work and is responsible for measuring the&#13;
4.15       Project    Preparation    Facility.     progress against the established benchmarks by&#13;
Disbursements of up to  US$1.5  million  are      certifying monthly work progress through Actas de&#13;

expenditures incurred in accordance with Bank     completion of the work.&#13;
procurement guidelines. This retroactive financing  5. Treasury makes the payment within 30 working&#13;
would be for expenditures made primarily under     days of the date of the work certificate after&#13;
category A after July 1, 1996 or one year prior to  approval from the Contra/orla.&#13;

retroactive financing of eligible expenditures would  6. At the conclusion of the work, the concessionaire&#13;
be submitted to the Bank no later than 90 days    recovers the five percent withheld amount.&#13;
after loan effectiveness. Agreement was reached&#13;
during negotiations on the retroactive financing arrangements.&#13;
4.17          Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, the Govemment would&#13;
establish, maintain and operate, under terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, a special account in&#13;
US dollars at a commercial bank acceptable to the Bank. The Bank would make an initial deposit of&#13;
US$2 million into the Special Account, rising to US$10 million after withdrawals and commitments have&#13;
reached US$25 million (including payments for retroactive financing). Replenishment of the Special&#13;
Account would be made in accordance with standard Bank procedures. Documentation would be retained&#13;
by the Borrower and would be made available for periodic inspection by the Bank.&#13;
E. Auditing&#13;
4.18          Agreement was confirmed during negotiations that the UEP would maintain adequate&#13;
records to reflect its operating and financial situation, in accordance with sound accounting principles&#13;
applied consistently. The project's accounts would be available for inspection by the Bank. The UEP&#13;
would have its accounts, including those kept for the purposes of the project, the Special Account, and&#13;
the statements of expenditure audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. These&#13;
audits would be presented to the Bank no later than six months after the close of the fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26-&#13;
F. Project Monitoring and Reporting&#13;
4.19         The Govemment through the UEP would be responsible for (a) monitoring the&#13;
Implementation of all project components; (b) evaluating the impact of the measures supported by the&#13;
proposed project; (c) reporting to the Bank; (d) disbursement arrangements; and (e) preparing the&#13;
Implementation Completion Report. The project performance and monitoring indicators are described in&#13;
Annex D.&#13;
4.20         In about November of each year, the Bank and the Government would conduct a formal&#13;
joint review of the progress made in reaching the project objectives and in the implementation of the&#13;
proposed project. The annual review would provide an opportunity to discuss project issues, in particular&#13;
compliance with covenants, technical assistance, traffic safety, and the quality of subproject&#13;
implementation; it would conclude in a set of updated monitoring targets and any remedial actions that&#13;
may be required.&#13;
4.21         A Mid-Term Review would be held with the participation of the Government and&#13;
Metrovias no later than November 1999. The Mid-Term Review would undertake an in-depth interim&#13;
assessment of progress in implementing project components, based on the implementation indicators.&#13;
Based on its assessment, the Mid-Term Review would conclude with an agreement on changes in project&#13;
implementation and a schedule for their implementation, if required.&#13;
4.22         Reporting. The UEP would submit to the Bank semi-annual project implementation&#13;
progress reports relating to January-June and July-December periods no later than 30 days after the end&#13;
of each semester. The progress reports would describe advances made in implementation of the project&#13;
against the appraisal estimates. They would present a critical assessment of problems and issues arising&#13;
during project execution. The reports would also discuss compliance with the covenants of the Loan&#13;
Agreement and other conditions and actions taken to enforce compliance. In cases of unsatisfactory&#13;
progress, the reports would also describe proposals for adjustments and remedial actions. The&#13;
Implementation Progress Reports would include updates of the key hidicators of project performance.&#13;
The UEP would also submit a project completion report not later than six months after the closing date of&#13;
the loan.&#13;
G. Project Supervision&#13;
4.23         Bank supervision of project execution would be particularly important during the first&#13;
three years of the project, when significant institutional strengthening and policy decisions would be&#13;
occurring. The bulk of disbursements is also expected during these initial years. The Bank would conduct&#13;
two supervision missions each year; the second of these missions would coincide with the planned&#13;
annual/mid-term reviews. Staffing for these missions would normally include the task manager, a&#13;
financial analyst, a transport planner, and a procurement specialist. A total of about 50 staff-weeks would&#13;
be required each year for the first two years, thereafter decreasing to 25 staff-weeks in the third year and&#13;
15 staff-weeks in the fourth year until the end of the project.&#13;

- 29 -                                ANNEX A&#13;
BUENOS AIRES URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX A: TRANSPORT IN METROPOLITAN BUENOS AIRES-ISSUES AND OUTLOOK&#13;
A. Basic Transport Conditions in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area&#13;
1.    The metropolitan area of Buenos Aires exhibits several characteristics which make the&#13;
maintenance of high-quality transport inherently difficult. First, it is large. It has a total population of over&#13;
12 million and covers an area of over 16,000 km2. No city of this size in the world is without transport and&#13;
traffic problems. Second, it has a difficult shape. Being bounded on one side by the River Plate, and&#13;
having the main administrative and business centers located close together by the river, its road and rail&#13;
transport networks and flows take the form of a 1800 fan with very heavy concentrations of traffic on the&#13;
main radials. Third, it is administratively complex. It is comprised of the Municipality of Buenos Aires and&#13;
36 other municipalities in the Province of Buenos Aires, which share responsibilities for transport&#13;
provision with some executive agencies of the National Govemment.&#13;
2.    Road congestion is perceived as increasing within the city, although there are no reliable direct&#13;
statistics either on levels of traffic or on average traffic speeds. Nevertheless it is estimated that the&#13;
national vehicle stock has increased by 1.7 million vehicles in three years. Over a longer period, the&#13;
proportion of trips by private car in Buenos Aires has increased from 15 percent in 1970 to 35 percent in&#13;
1995. Congestion has had a serious effect on the operation of the bus service. One bus operator&#13;
estimated that he had increased his fleet size from 72 vehicles to 104 vehicles over a period of 25 years&#13;
in order to maintain the same specified frequencies. More recently it has been estimated that there has&#13;
been a loss of 5-7 percent on vehicle kilometers between 1992 and 1995 due to increased congestion.&#13;
3.    Rail passenger transport in the metropolitan area is provided on a network of 37 km of subway, 7&#13;
km of surface light rail transit, and 900 km of suburban railway. There are proposals under consideration&#13;
for two further metro lines within the central area and for the electrification of some sections of the&#13;
suburban railways. Service is provided entirely by private sector consortia operating a government-&#13;
owned system under concessions. The concessions vary in duration and were subject to a procedure of&#13;
competitive bidding. In all cases, the concession involves a commitment to provide a minimum level of&#13;
service at a specified fare (with adjustment arrangements specified), as well as undertaking investment&#13;
programs defined in the concession contracts. The concessions provide for capital payments for the&#13;
investment program, operating subsidies (particularly in the early years of the concessions) and canons&#13;
(royalty payments to the Govemment, usually in the later years of the concession). In the case of the&#13;
subway, the contract provided for some infrastructure to be rehabilitated directly on the Government's&#13;
account (Line A). Contracts were awarded on the basis of the lowest net present cost to the Government&#13;
of the financial flows proposed.&#13;
4.    Bus services (colectivos) within the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area (AMBA) are also provided&#13;
entirely by the private sector. About 15,000 vehicles operate legally within the region. Service is provided&#13;
on the basis of route franchises granted either to single companies or to associations of operators&#13;
working as a single "empresa"(company) for regulatory purposes. Although originally the system had a&#13;
very fragmented ownership, only about five percent of the total capacity remains in the hands of owner-&#13;
drivers. Each route (which may have several variants at its peripheries) is granted as a monopoly&#13;
franchise, but there is extensive overlap between routes to create and maintain a high level of&#13;
competition in operation. In addition to these vehicles in public service, a further 1,500 vehicles are&#13;
licensed to provide various forms of limited availability and charter service.&#13;
5.    The size of the bus fleet has remained approximately constant over the last 25 years. The&#13;
amount of seat-kilometers available is also estimated to have changed relatively little as a consequence&#13;
of the rough balance between increased average number of buses and reduced average operating&#13;
speeds due to congestion. Vehicle size has increased by about 30 percent over 25 years, with 8.5-meter&#13;
vehicles being progressively replaced by 11-meter vehicles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A                                     30 -&#13;
6.    Conditions of employment in the industry are strictly regulated. Labor is normally employed on&#13;
contracts involving a driving day of eight hours, with vehicles operated on multi-shift systems. Split shifts&#13;
are not normally permissible so that inter-peak service is maintained at relatively high levels. Some&#13;
flexibility has been introduced recently with legal permission for employment of new staff on a 5-hour&#13;
shift basis, and there has been a progressive elimination of "extra workW arrangements. Recent changes&#13;
have included the obligatory use of farebox systems for fare collection and European Union&#13;
environmental standards for new vehicles.&#13;
7.     Taxis dominate the central city, where in the central zones they comprise nearly 50 percent of&#13;
the traffic flow. There are about 40,000 licensed taxis in the Municipality of Buenos Aires alone. There&#13;
are also many taxis operating illegally. Unemployment has contributed to this excessive supply.&#13;
S.    Some modal integration has already been stimulated by market pressures. For example, the&#13;
pattem of bus routes in the corridor of subway Line A / Rivadavia clearly shows the density of services&#13;
concentrating on the outer terminus of the rail route. Moreover, some restructuring of bus routes to serve&#13;
rail heads is possible and has been occurring under the present regulatory arrangements. In many such&#13;
cases, however, there has been no explicit planning of the infrastructure to facilitate the interchange.&#13;
Where major traffic routes are involved, this results in heavy pedestrian flows across dense, high-speed&#13;
traffic flows with serious safety implications. Lack of coordination or collaboration among disparate&#13;
agencies is a primary reason for this situation.&#13;
B. Current Institutional Arrangements&#13;
9.    There is no metropolitan-level jurisdiction and hence there is no single institutional focus for&#13;
urban transport planning in the city region. The agreement between the Minister of Economy and the&#13;
Mayor of Buenos Aires, signed in 1991, set up a precursor of an autonomous agency. Although the&#13;
legislation to create a permanent autonomous agency (ATAM-Autondad del Transporte del Area&#13;
Metropolitana) was passed by the Senate, it failed to gain broad political support and is unlikely to&#13;
materialize.&#13;
10.   The body set up as a precursor (pre-ATAM) has developed into a competent planning unit. It&#13;
performs planning, design and assessment functions for metropolitan transport, particularly in respect to&#13;
matters which fall within the national jurisdiction, but also, to a lesser extent, in collaboration with other&#13;
jurisdictions. In late 1996, it was converted into new unit (TUAMBA-Transporte Urbano del Area&#13;
Metropolitana de Buenos Aires) with the objective of maintaining it as a core for metropolitan transport&#13;
planning.&#13;
11.   Responsibility for the elements which together determine the nature of urban transport in Buenos&#13;
Aires remains fragmented. In some cases the same function is performed by a different institutional level&#13;
in different parts of the metropolitan area. In many cases functions which interact are exercised by&#13;
different jurisdictions or agencies, with little formal collaboration or coordination of policy in areas in&#13;
which the functional or jurisdictional interests overlap. Even within the national jurisdiction there has&#13;
been little coordination between the secretariats of public works and of transport in respect to&#13;
metropolitan transport responsibilities. In June 1996, the public works and transport functions were&#13;
merged into a single Secretariat. Partly in response to suggestions made by the pre-appraisal mission,&#13;
the Subsecretariat of Metropolitan and Long-Distance Transport has been given road planning functions,&#13;
in addition to those of public transport planning.&#13;
12.   Major road investments-particularly the construction of radial motorway access into the city -&#13;
used to be the responsibility of the public works secretariat within the Ministry of the Economy before it&#13;
was merged into SOPyT. New construction is mainly being undertaken by the private sector under toll&#13;
road concessions. This is managed by OCRABA, a special agency of the public works secretariat (and&#13;
now SOPyT). For the most part, schemes for the major access links are already committed through&#13;
concession agreements, though in some important cases the works have not yet been designed in detail.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -                                 ANNEX A&#13;
13.    Maintenance and management of the local road network within the city region fall to the&#13;
provincial or municipal governments. However, many provincial roads are maintained by the regional&#13;
offices of the national jurisdiction.&#13;
14.    Road safety and traffic enforcement is the responsibility of the police, under the Ministry of the&#13;
Interior. Road safety programs are also prepared by a special purpose unit (Conamba). There is no local&#13;
control of this policing function. Administration of road safety appears to be very lax, with an absence&#13;
even of adequate accident records and statistics.&#13;
15.    Road traffic management is a municipal function. This includes not only responsibility for&#13;
signaling and general management of street traffic but also specific measures such as the&#13;
implementation of bus lanes. Parking policy and implementation is also formally a municipal function,&#13;
though there is no well-articulated policy on either the quantity of parking provision or on charges for&#13;
parking. The most important functions of city center traffic management thus fall to the Municipality of&#13;
the City of Buenos Aires (MCBA), which has not been able to prevent the deterioration of city-center&#13;
traffic conditions. The situation was considered to have reached such a bad state that the National&#13;
Govemment established a Traffic Emergency Committee in late 1994 to develop immediate measures to&#13;
improve the situation. A scheme was introduced to protect the micro-center from through traffic, and&#13;
some exclusive bus lanes were designed and implemented as part of this initiative. In some cases (as for&#13;
example the bus lane on Avenida C6rdoba) the Municipality sought the technical advice of the national&#13;
administration (in this case pre-ATAM) in the design of schemes.&#13;
16.    Metropolitan rail transport is provided by the subway and suburban railways. The former is&#13;
technically owned by the Municipality of Buenos Aires and the latter by the National Govemment. In&#13;
practice all metropolitan rail transport has become the responsibility of the nation (through the national&#13;
financing and management of the passenger rail concessions, managed by an agency of the SOPyT).&#13;
The concession contracts were supervised by the Coordination Unit for the Railway Restructuring&#13;
Program (UCPF), which in late 1996 was converted into the Gerencia Ferroviaria de la Comisi6n&#13;
Nacional de la Regulaci6n de Transporte (GFCNRT). It is responsible for all aspects of the planning,&#13;
regulation and control of rail transport.&#13;
17.    Rail fares are specified in real terms within the concession contracts, with provisions for fares to&#13;
be adjusted to account for inflation or in response to achievements of levels of service in excess of those&#13;
specified within the contracts. Complex formulations have been developed for the calculation of these&#13;
contractually permissible fare increases. In practice, the base level of rail fares is very low. Particularly&#13;
for long-distance movements, rail fares are less than half those of the buses (see Table Al).&#13;
18.   Increases in rail fares to bring them more in line with bus rates might assist some bus operations&#13;
which are in direct competition with rail routes, attenuate the peak demand on rail capacity which is often&#13;
stretched, and generate revenues which might be devoted either to direct reduction of rail subsidy&#13;
payments through renegotiation of&#13;
the  concession  contracts  or to     Table Al: Fare Comparisons for Some Long-Distance&#13;

of the Municipality, the jurisdiction is national, and is implemented by the National Commission for Motor&#13;
Transport (CoNTA), which controls about 10,000 of the 15,000 licensed buses in the metropolitan area.&#13;
Buses operating between municipalities in the Province of Buenos Aires are a provincial responsibility,&#13;
operated by 114 separate route operators. About 1,000 buses operating entirely within individual&#13;
municipalities in the Province (excluding the Municipality of Buenos Aires) are purely a municipal&#13;
responsibility. Policies on bus licensing are much more liberal in some of the outer municipalities than in&#13;
the national jurisdiction. Fares for bus services within the national jurisdiction are set by the Secretary of&#13;
Public Works and Transport within the Ministry of Economy. Although bus fares for the other jurisdictions&#13;
are formally within the local jurisdictional competence, de facto they follow national jurisdiction fares.&#13;
20.    Taxi regulation is exclusively a municipal function throughout the metropolitan area. Particularly&#13;
in the Municipality of Buenos Aires, implementation of taxi licensing policy has been "liberal", with an&#13;
estimated 20,000 vehicles operating illegally in addition to the legally licensed stock of about 40,000.&#13;
Taxi fares also fall within the municipal jurisdiction. The taxi business appears also to have considerable&#13;
political weight; for example, it was able to persuade the Municipality to allow taxis access to the newly-&#13;
created bus lane on Avenida C6rdoba very soon after its introduction.&#13;
C. Recent Changes and Their Effects on the Transport Sector&#13;
21.   There is considerable talk of a trisis"in urban transport in Buenos Aires and of the need to re-&#13;
organize transport arrangements to meet the crisis. However, in considering the current problems of the&#13;
transport industry, the depth of the current recession in activity is the dominating factor to be bome in&#13;
mind. Unemployment is officially declared as being 16.4 percent, but popularly believed to be&#13;
considerably higher. This has direct effects on the demand for all modes. Gasoline consumption fell by 5&#13;
percent in 1995, and has continued to fall slightly in 1996. The effect of recession has been particularly&#13;
severe on the buses, which lost 22 percent of their traffic in 1994 and 1995. In 1996, the traffic loss&#13;
continued, though at what appears to be a reduced rate. Studies undertaken by CoNTA, as well as the&#13;
views expressed by bus operator associations, attribute the bulk of this decline to the recession.&#13;
22.    There has been some response to the decline in demand by bus operators, both in reductions in&#13;
frequency and some route restructuring to take account of rail service improvements (bus service&#13;
changes have to be approved by CoNTA). Surprisingly, there have been few bankruptcies, partly&#13;
because of increases in the minimum bus fare from 35 cents to 40 cents in August 1993, and to 50 cents&#13;
in August 1994. It is suggested that there has been some consolidation among the buses, as well as&#13;
some deferment of vehicle replacement. However, there is no strong statistical evidence for either of&#13;
these trends.&#13;
23.   The recession has also had some direct effects on supply. Unemployment appears to have led to&#13;
an expansion both in the legally licensed 'remise"(hire car) business, of which there are now estimated&#13;
to be about 12,000 operating as taxis or public transport vehicles. There are also about 500 buses and&#13;
minibuses operating as legal charter services and probably another 1,000 engaged in the operation of&#13;
illegal, unfranchised bus operations. This appears to have been of particular importance in the outer&#13;
municipalities of the AMBA where competition is particularly fierce and, in some cases, clearly condoned&#13;
by the local political authority. The licensed buses find this form of competition particularly difficult to&#13;
respond to in areas where enforcement is lax.&#13;
24.   Since the concessioning of urban railway services, there has been a substantial increase in rail&#13;
patronage. Because of the high level of fare evasion before the concessioning, and the absence of direct&#13;
counts, it is not possible to state with accuracy what has happened to the "actual" level of ridership.&#13;
Improved service has undoubtedly attracted many new riders, though the increased attention to fare&#13;
recovery has almost certainly driven some former non-paying passengers away. It is estimated, however,&#13;
that real traffic (as opposed to the number of passengers paying) has risen by at least 30 percent over a&#13;
two-year period.&#13;
25.   Once reliable rail service has been re-established, direct competition on line haul between rail&#13;
and buses is likely to diminish. An example of what might be expected to occur can be seen in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -                                ANNEX A&#13;
experience of one bus operation in the corridor of the Roca line. Before electrification of the rail line in&#13;
the 1980s, the bus operated 200 of its 240 vehicles in service directly competing with the railway. After&#13;
electrification only 90 of the vehicles operate on competitive routings, and 150 operate services that are&#13;
feeding the rail system.&#13;
D. Identified Problems&#13;
26.   Road Congestion. Road congestion is perceived as a growing problem, yet traffic restraint is&#13;
virtually non-existent outside the micro-center. Responsibility for traffic management falls to the&#13;
municipalities which are not well staffed to perform the function, and traffic management within the&#13;
metropolitan area is generally considered poor. It is, therefore, important to develop skills both of design&#13;
and implementation at the appropriate institutional level.&#13;
27.   In the longer term it would be desirable to introduce measures of traffic restraint. A consultant&#13;
employed by the Subsecretariat of Metropolitan and Long-Distance Transport recommended that this&#13;
possibility be further explored. In the interim some surrogate instrument, such as parking pricing or&#13;
quantitative restriction in parking availability is desirable. But the current institutional arrangements make&#13;
this unlikely in the near future. In that instance, there is a case for the introduction of a fuel tax surcharge&#13;
within the metropolitan area as a proxy. While fuel tax is not a very good instrument to proxy for a&#13;
congestion charge, it is better than nothing. In the current circumstances it would not only have some-&#13;
albeit very modest-impact as a constraint on use of roads, but would also have the advantage of&#13;
generating resources for a Metropolitan Transport Fund which might be used to fund metropolitan level&#13;
expenditures on the improvement of the sector as a whole.&#13;
28.    Bus priority schemes would appear to be justified by the volumes of traffic in a number of&#13;
corridors. Some limited schemes have been introduced by the Municipality of Buenos Aires. The fact that&#13;
so little has been achieved so far is partly because responsibility for introduction of such schemes rests&#13;
with the municipalities which are not well staffed for the design and implementation of such schemes,&#13;
while the regulation of buses using the lanes is the responsibility of CoNTA (at least in the national&#13;
jurisdiction). A broader system of bus lanes has been designed, but is not being implemented because of&#13;
the lack of commitment by the jurisdictions responsible for implementation.&#13;
29.   Bus Operations. Fare collection is commonly perceived as a problem. Because many routes&#13;
are long, a flat fare system is not appropriate. In the case of the buses, the introduction of the "farebox"&#13;
system of coin payment, considered necessary to secure revenues with one-person operation of the&#13;
vehicles, has had the effect of making fare payment a relatively slow process. At stops with high&#13;
boarding rates, this causes delay to the vehicle and congestion of the traffic flow of which it is a part.&#13;
There is an interest in the development of more technologically-advanced methods of fare collection. As&#13;
part of project preparation an intemational consultant was engaged by Govemment to advise on&#13;
altemative means of electronic fare collection and verification. In the first instance the emphasis is on&#13;
the identification of a common standard for the separate rail enterprises which would ultimately allow&#13;
common ticketing. Some of the bus managers are also interested in the possibility of smart-ticketing&#13;
systems as a means of improving efficiency of operation. This is another area where ensuring&#13;
coordination between the actions of separate agencies may have a high pay-off, irrespective of whether&#13;
implementation powers are centralized or not. It is also an area in which the basis for securing&#13;
coordination is the development of a center of technical advice on a metropolitan scale.&#13;
30.   Some bus industry re-organization would be necessary in response to changes in demand. In&#13;
particular, where demand is falling due to improvement of rail service this would require route&#13;
restructuring to concentrate on feeder services rather than trunk haul. This has already happened in a&#13;
number of cases. It may create difficulties for the operator where there is need to shift from a service&#13;
which falls under one jurisdiction (services into the Municipality of Buenos Aires) to one which falls under&#13;
another (services within an outer municipality). Some coordination of action between jurisdictions is then&#13;
required. Even where the change falls entirely within one jurisdiction, the process may be complex if a&#13;
change of route increases competition with existing operators. Similar issues might arise if some roads&#13;
were closed to bus traffic as part of general traffic management or environmental protection actions. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A                                    - 34 -&#13;
all these cases the problems are inherent in the kind of managed-competition system which has been so&#13;
successful in the past in maintaining public bus services in Buenos Aires. It is not a reason for any&#13;
fundamental institutional change. But it does indicate the need for better collaboration between agencies&#13;
and a better basis for understanding the effects of change over a wider area.&#13;
31.    Environmental and Safety Impact. The environmental impacts of transport currently receive&#13;
little attention. The buses, which might be viewed as beneficial because they obviate the need for&#13;
increased use of cars in the city, seem to be regarded somewhat suspiciously because of the very&#13;
obvious phenomenon of smoke emissions of the worst vehicies. CoNTA is addressing this by imposing&#13;
European Union environmental standards on new bus purchases. In contrast, taxis and private cars,&#13;
which make much more prodigal use of road space, are very liberally treated. There is currently neither&#13;
any direct charging for the congestion impacts of these vehicles nor any satisfactory surrogate measure&#13;
(such as restrictive parking or regulatory policies for vehicles operating in the central area).&#13;
32.    There appear to be a number of reasons for this neglect of environmental sustainability in urban&#13;
transport. First there is a lack of information, with no program of monitoring of transport-related&#13;
environmental impacts and hence no basis on which to develop a strategy. This would be one of the&#13;
early priorities of the technical group to be developed under the project. Second, there appears to be a&#13;
lack of appreciation at the highest levels of the national administration that environmental protection&#13;
requires a close coordination of the design of infrastructure and its management as well as control of the&#13;
vehicles operating on it. Third, the fragmentation of responsibilities for the various aspects which&#13;
contribute to environmental management in urban transport prevents the emergence of a comprehensive&#13;
policy.&#13;
33.    Road safety is also severely neglected. The assignment of responsibilities to Conamba, within&#13;
the Ministry of Interior, inevitably separates the issue from the administration of local traffic management&#13;
and infrastructure design which are important contributors to better safety performance. In this area of&#13;
environmental concem, as with air quality, the necessary initial steps are the organization of a reliable&#13;
data base for the identification of topics for priority attention and the establishment of a locus of&#13;
responsibility for traffic safety which can bring together a range of actions in a comprehensive policy.&#13;
Weaknesses in inter-agency and inter-jurisdictional collaboration clearly need to be addressed.&#13;
34.    There are over 700 at-grade crossings of railways by roads in the metropolitan area, 500 of&#13;
which are protected by manually or automatically operated barriers. Accident rates at these crossings are&#13;
already high. Delays to road traffic are large and are increasing as rail service frequency improves. A&#13;
concerted effort to improve this situation is being supported by the project. However, it is important to&#13;
emphasize that effective action in this area, as in many others in Greater Buenos Aires, requires&#13;
improved collaboration  between the agencies and jurisdictions (national transport jurisdiction,&#13;
municipalities, railway concessionaires, police, etc.). Defining a focus for this collaboration and&#13;
establishing a capability to prioritize and design schemes is an important requirement.&#13;
35.    Railway Development and Modal Integration. The concessioning of the railways was achieved&#13;
rapidly and is already demonstrably successful in improving rail patronage and reducing operating&#13;
subsidy. But it is the inevitable consequence of the speed of the process that some of the investment&#13;
programs which were included in the concession contracts are not considered by the concessionaires to&#13;
be the best possible use of resources. Replanning of the investment program and renegotiation of the&#13;
contracts is therefore necessary. The establishment and maintenance of a strong technical base for the&#13;
Govemment responsibilities as a ucustomer' is critical to the success of this further development.&#13;
E. The Government Strategy for Urban Transport&#13;
36.    There are two main policy elements of a strategic nature which have been applied fairly&#13;
consistently: the successful operation of transport services though the private sector, and the rather&#13;
inefficient coordination of strategic transport planning and traffic management in the metropolitan area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35-                                  ANNEX A&#13;
37.   Private sector participation in supply, which has long existed in the bus and taxi industry, has&#13;
been extended over the last four years to the whole of the urban and suburban rail network and to some&#13;
trunk road accesses into the city through the concession process. Moreover, in the bus, rail and toll road&#13;
sectors there are National Govemment agencies for management of the competitive market (National&#13;
Commission for Motor Transport-CoNTA, Coordination Unit for the Railway Restructuring Program-&#13;
UCPF, and the agency responsible for urban motorway concessions-OCRABA) to award and supervise&#13;
the concession systems.&#13;
38.   The Government maintains control over prices for all transport modes, despite the move to&#13;
private operation. In most instances this control is exercised centrally, at the highest level, and has been&#13;
used to keep transport fares low.&#13;
39.   Despite these central strategic elements, in identifying current problems it is clear that a&#13;
substantial part of the problems arise where the jurisdictions overlap without adequate collaboration or&#13;
coordination of action. What is missing in the existing framework is any effective planning and&#13;
implementation of road traffic management, any coordination of road traffic and public transport policy&#13;
implementation, and any concerted effort to deal with the safety and environmental problems associated&#13;
with metropolitan transport, including the absence of any strategy for traffic restraint. To some extent that&#13;
is a matter of intemal coordination between the transport and public works secretariats. One of the aims&#13;
of the project is to improve that relationship through association in the management of the technical&#13;
group for metropolitan transport planning.&#13;
40.   To some extent, however, the lack of coordination is a matter of the fragmentation of&#13;
responsibility over fields in which there is substantial interaction. Separation of responsibility within the&#13;
Municipality of Buenos Aires for bus lanes (municipal jurisdiction) and bus route regulation (national&#13;
jurisdiction) is a case in point. The direct election of the mayor of the Municipality opens up the possibility&#13;
of metropolitan transport policy becoming a source of political conflict between authorities under different&#13;
political control. The transfer of responsibility to an overarching metropolitan level agency, with&#13;
appropriate powers and financial resources, would almost certainly be seen as a means of reducing the&#13;
powers of the democratically elected municipal government and is thus unlikely to be achieved in the&#13;
short term.&#13;
F. The Philosophy of the Project&#13;
41.   From the viewpoint of the World Bank's experience in the urban transport sector, the current&#13;
situation in Buenos Aires presents a mixed picture, including some dimensions in which the city has been&#13;
outstandingly successful and others in which it appears to be relatively backward.&#13;
42.   The institutions which have been put in place do seem to have come to grips with the problem of&#13;
creating an economically and financially sustainable basis for public transport operations. The emphasis&#13;
on private sector operation accords well with intemational experience on supply efficiency in urban&#13;
transport. The existence of competition between overlapping routes in a regulated framework for the bus&#13;
industry also appears to be structurally good practice. Institutions for supervision of both bus franchising&#13;
and railway concessions appear to be reasonably effective.&#13;
43.   The problems of social sustainability are also being addressed through the measures to ensure&#13;
the maintenance and financing of an extensive and affordable public transport system. Insofar as this&#13;
involves direct subsidy of public transport, the specification of fare levels within the rail concession&#13;
contracts clearly separates Govemment strategic control over fares from company management&#13;
responsibility for supply. This is also a generally advisable structure where transport subsidies are part of&#13;
Govemment policy.&#13;
44.   The major weakness concems environmental sustainability. In this dimension there appears to be&#13;
an absence of any appreciation of the need for the operational interactions between modes to be taken&#13;
into account. In particular the failure to recognize the strategic importance of public sector planning and&#13;
management of road infrastructure and road traffic threatens ever-increasing road congestion and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A                                  -36 -&#13;
environmental deterioration (especially as the economy recovers and incomes, car ownership, and&#13;
vehicle use increase). This failure of vision is reflected in the absence of appropriate institutions.&#13;
45.   The main initiative which is currently helping to protect the environment is the emphasis on&#13;
refurbishing the metropolitan rail network (although this was stimulated as much by immediate financial&#13;
and social pressures as by environmental objectives). In this context there are some physical&#13;
investments in the public transport system which should be beneficial even in the absence of appropriate&#13;
policies for road transport. These include the major rehabilitation of the subway Line A, which would&#13;
collapse without an urgent investment program. Indeed, in this particular case the benefit of the&#13;
investment would be even greater in the absence of efficient measures of road traffic management than&#13;
with them. The investments in the grade crossings and transfer facilities also support increased use of&#13;
the improved rail network. While these are subject to-and satisfy-the normal economic tests, for the&#13;
most part their benefits are also not dependent on the achievement of any specific institutional reforms.&#13;
46.   For many of the problems identified above, particularly those which have environmental&#13;
significance, the absence of coordination between agencies, and the lack of an adequate knowledge&#13;
basis for the design and implementation of policies and instruments, is either critical or at the very least&#13;
unhelpful. The challenge in designing a project is, therefore, to attempt to find ways of developing a&#13;
broader political appreciation of the importance of a more comprehensive approach to the problems of&#13;
urban transport as a basis for creating appropriate coordination of policies and institutions.&#13;
47.   The philosophy of the project is therefore to help introduce measures aimed at increasing&#13;
commitment to a greater level of metropolitan transport coordination. It is believed that this can best be&#13;
achieved by demonstrating the possibilities and advantages of coordinated action, based on strong&#13;
technical capability, to deal with commonly recognized problems. The strategy of the project is to&#13;
encourage this in three ways:&#13;
(a) the development of a core group of technical skills in metropolitan transport planning to&#13;
ensure a sound technical basis for the design and implementation of metropolitan transport&#13;
and traffic measures;&#13;
(b) the carrying out of an urban transport study which would require the cooperation of diverse&#13;
agencies throughout the metropolitan area, and produce planning tools and projections&#13;
useful to all of them; and&#13;
(c) the creation of a management committee, which would include representatives of the&#13;
different functions and jurisdictional levels, to identify problems common to the separate&#13;
jurisdictions and to provide policy guidance to the technical core group.&#13;
48.   The development of the technical capacity to adequately address the complex interactions within&#13;
the urban transport system is at the center of the strategy for institutional strengthening. The first part of&#13;
the strategy is to establish a project implementation unit for the World Bank project, which would be&#13;
technically oriented and have close links with the new core group developed for metropolitan transport&#13;
planning. These groups would be the agencies responsible for the assembly of the metropolitan transport&#13;
data base and analysis capability and would have staff representation from road and transport agencies.&#13;
49.   The second part of the strategy is to associate those entities, who would benefit from a more&#13;
coordinated approach, in the management of the technical group and the urban transport study. The&#13;
purpose of the management committee (representing the various functional and jurisdictional authorities)&#13;
would be to identify issues of common concem suitable for analysis at the metropolitan level; to address&#13;
these issues the skills of the technical group would be made available. The initial approach to&#13;
coordination is thus problem-oriented, bottom-up," but with a long-term view of converting the&#13;
committee into a permanent body responsible for transport planning for the entire metropolitan area.&#13;

BUENOS AIRES URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX B: PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
(AS DEFINED BY THE BORROWER)&#13;
A. Government Strategies on Subways/Metropolitan Railways&#13;
1.    The capital of Argentina, Buenos Aires, is a major urban center where most of the economic and&#13;
financial activities of the country take place. It is estimated that more than 50 percent of the economic&#13;
activities of the country develop in Buenos Aires and vicinities, and its population is over 10 million&#13;
people. Urban transport presents several areas that need improvement to cope with the growing&#13;
demand, but the current situation is not as critical as in other cities in the world of comparable size and&#13;
activity.&#13;
2.    In 1989, the Government passed Law 23696 (Ley de Refonma del Estado) which laid the&#13;
foundation for a major reform program in the public sector. It declared 'subject to privatization"many&#13;
public enterprises and services, which among others included surface and underground railway services,&#13;
for passengers as well as cargo. The strategy for concessioning the metropolitan passenger railway&#13;
system to the private sector was established in 1991, when explicit subsidies and public financing of&#13;
works were allowed to be offered to future concessionaires to encourage their participation. For political&#13;
reasons, tariffs are kept at a low level, and consequently the concept of subsidized concessions was the&#13;
only commercially viable option to privatize the service.&#13;
3.    The suburban railway surface system was then divided into seven lines or groups of services,&#13;
and in one of them, the Urquiza line, the subway was also included because of technical compatibility&#13;
reasons. The Government defined the minimum service to be provided by the concessionaire, and the&#13;
standards of service quality. Moreover the Government defined a plan of investments (track renewal,&#13;
rolling stock, signaling, telecommunications, electric systems, shops, etc.) to be implemented in each&#13;
line to be concessioned.&#13;
4.    Parties interested in becoming concessionaires had to bid, under a competitive framework,&#13;
specifying the requested subsidy (which could eventually been either positive or negative) to operate the&#13;
service during the concession period (10 years for six suburban lines, 20 years for the Urquiza Line -&#13;
Subway), and the requested amount to be received from the Govemment for executing the&#13;
predetermined works. The selection criterion was to award the contract to the bidder that requested the&#13;
minimum amount from the Govemment, measured as the Net Present Value at 12 percent interest of all&#13;
requested amounts.&#13;
5.    By 1995, the system was completely privatized. Initial results are encouraging. For passenger&#13;
railway traffic: (a) the passenger volume has almost doubled in 1996 as compared with the volume&#13;
transported in 1993, the last year the system was 100 percent publicly run; (b) the percentage of on-time&#13;
trains as compared with the total planned trains, was about 95 percent in 1996, while it had been 77&#13;
percent in 1993; (c) canceled and delayed trains were about 7,500 in the first quarter of 1996, compared&#13;
to 37,000 for the same period in 1993; and (d) coach-kilometers increased 27 percent between the same&#13;
two years. In the subway, passenger traffic volumes increased by 37 percent, minutes of interruption&#13;
were lowered by 61 percent, and coach-kilometers increased by 33 percent between those periods. As a&#13;
result, the general public opinion is very positive.&#13;
B. Project Objectives&#13;
6.    The Project's general objectives would be to: (a) support the private-public partnership in&#13;
improving the service quality and coverage of mass transit; (b) support the infrastructure improvements&#13;
defined in the concession agreement between the Govemment and the private sector; (c) assist in&#13;
improving the conditions of traffic safety and environmental quality; and (d) help in developing an&#13;
integrated urban transport (road and rail) system for the AMBA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX B                                    - 38 -&#13;
7.    The specific project objectives would be to:&#13;
(a)    finance the rail equipment and infrastructure which are critical for the upgrading of public&#13;
transport services;&#13;
(b)    promote the integration of the transport system by upgrading transfer stations along rail&#13;
lines, building better transfer facilities between rail and road-based transport, and&#13;
generally improving road access to rail stations;&#13;
(c)    improve traffic safety through the enhancement of controls at road/rail grade crossings,&#13;
the construction of grade separations at high-volume crossings, the development of a&#13;
complementary program of road safety actions, and the introduction of systematic air&#13;
pollution monitoring; and&#13;
(d)    strengthen the institutional framework which would ensure the operation of an&#13;
economically and environmentally sustainable transport system in the metropolitan area.&#13;
C. Overall Project Implementation&#13;
8.     The Borrower would be the Republic of Argentina, and the Executing Agency would be the&#13;
Secretariat of Public Works and Transport (SOPyT) in the Ministry of Economy and Public Works and&#13;
Services. The Secretary of Public Works and Transport would be the National Project Director with the&#13;
Subsecretary of Metropolitan and Long-Distance Transport as Altemate Director, and would provide the&#13;
necessary policy and strategic decisions to facilitate project implementation. The Secretary and Sub-&#13;
secretary would maintain periodic contacts with the Bank during project execution to reach agreement on&#13;
key matters and would exercise overall supervision of project implementation.&#13;
9.    The management of day-to-day matters related to all stages of project preparation is the&#13;
responsibility of a Project Coordination Unit (UCP - Unidad Coordinadora del Proyecto). After loan&#13;
approval, the UCP would be transformed into a Project Implementation Unit (UEP - Unidad Ejecutora del&#13;
Proyecto) which would be responsible for project implementation. Main specific tasks of the UEP would&#13;
be to:&#13;
(a)    coordinate all activities related to the project;&#13;
(b)    assist the National and Altemate Directors in monitoring project activities, and in his&#13;
relations with the Bank, other Secretariats of State, municipalities of the AMBA, Province&#13;
of Buenos Aires, concessionaires and other private groups;&#13;
(c)    establish and implement a permanent system to link project activities with other agents&#13;
involved, such as municipalities and concessionaires;&#13;
(d)   take the necessary actions to ensure compliance with Bank requirements in all aspects&#13;
of the project;&#13;
(e)    prepare periodic reports to the Bank as required;&#13;
(f)    prepare terms of reference to hire consultants and monitor the entire process, including&#13;
their selection;&#13;
(g)    coordinate activities performed by intemational and national consultants, together with&#13;
the required local counterparts, and review, comment and discuss draft and final reports&#13;
being prepared by them;&#13;
(h)    monitor and update the Project Work Plan, and take necessary actions to correct any&#13;
deviations;&#13;
(i)    oversee, with likely help by consultants, the technical activities related to project&#13;
preparation and execution;&#13;
0)    take all necessary actions to ensure timely availability of funds from different sources;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -                                ANNEX B&#13;
(k)    produce and interpret, periodically, the agreed monitoring indices to assess project&#13;
impacts;&#13;
(I)    monitor all activities related to any procurement process; and&#13;
(m)   manage all project accounting activities, including Special Account, disbursements, and&#13;
auditing reports.&#13;
10.   The UEP would be headed by a General Coordinator, assisted by a Technical Assistance&#13;
Coordinator, a Project Works Coordinator, and an Administrative Coordinator. In each of the three areas,&#13;
permanent staff and individual consultants would be hired as required by the work load. It is expected&#13;
that the permanent staff of the core unit may be composed of seven senior professionals, five medium-&#13;
level professionals, five junior professionals and five support staff, who would be complemented by non-&#13;
permanent staff, as required. For the technical area, where a major study would be developed, the&#13;
proposal is that personnel formerly working for Pre-ATAM (recently renamed TUAMBA - Transporte&#13;
Urbano del Area Metropolitana de Buenos Aires) would be contracted by the Govemment for the duration&#13;
of the loan. The final composition of the UEP would be agreed prior to loan effectiveness. Procurement&#13;
and works supervision would be carried out by the Project Works area of the UEP. There is also a&#13;
possibility of contracting the services of specialized agents, acceptable to the Bank, to manage&#13;
procurement activities for civil works, goods and/or consultants.&#13;
11.   In accordance with the concession contract, the concessionaire Metrovias would act as&#13;
executing agent for the Investment Program of the Metrovias Concession.&#13;
D. Rehabilitation of Subway Line A&#13;
12.   This program would include: (a) the complete renewal of track; (b) new ventilation systems,&#13;
replacement or installation of mechanical escalators, replacement of drainage pumps, and consolidation&#13;
in one place of two existing subway stations at Lima and Piedras; (c) three new electric substations,&#13;
renewal of the power transmission system and improvement of the contact line; and (d) renovation of the&#13;
signal and communication system. It has been agreed that these works would be carried out in four&#13;
packages of contracts, one for each component. In addition, the contractor currently modernizing the&#13;
train control centers for Lines B, C, D and E would be appointed to carry out the same work for Line A.&#13;
13.   As specified in the concession contract with Metrovias, the Govemment was to rehabilitate Line&#13;
A by the end of 1997. The estimated base cost is approximately US$82 million which, after adding taxes,&#13;
contingencies, and construction supervision, results in an overall cost of about US$121 million. Cost&#13;
estimates are based on preliminary engineering data, cost amounts quoted by different concessionaires&#13;
at the time of presenting their proposals, unofficial insight of some recent bid results obtained by&#13;
Metrovias for other subway lines for similar type of works under lump-sum arrangements, and previous&#13;
subway experience in lump-sum contracts; they also take account of the requirement that the work has to&#13;
be done while maintaining traffic during regular service hours (6 a.m. to 10 p.m.). It is estimated that the&#13;
contract would last two years.&#13;
14.   Because of the technical need for compatibility with the same kind of systems being installed in&#13;
Lines B, C, D, and E, and with the purpose of later permitting operation as one integrated system, it&#13;
would be preferable for component (d) in para. 12 to have exactly the same technical characteristics as&#13;
the systems being installed in the other four lines. This is true for both the signaling and&#13;
telecommunication aspects.&#13;
15.   SOPyT, through the UEP, would be the executing agent of the four main components of Line A.&#13;
As such, it would be responsible for the preparation of bidding documents; it would manage the whole&#13;
procurement process; it would select the winning proposal and sign the contract with the contractor; it&#13;
would approve detailed engineering plans; it would supervise project execution with the assistance of&#13;
outside consultants; and it would issue monthly payment certificates. The UEP would have to closely&#13;
coordinate with Metrovias, which is responsible for the day-to-day operation of Line A. This is spelled out&#13;
in an agreement between Metrovias and the government, prepared prior to loan negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX B                                   - 40 -&#13;
16.   Economic Costs. Line A was open to traffic in 1913, and very little upgrading has been carried&#13;
out since. Therefore, the current conditions are totally unsatisfactory, and it is understood that without&#13;
major improvements, total collapse is likely. For the economic analysis of this subproject, it was&#13;
assumed that in the without-project situation, the line would have to close in about five years. It was not&#13;
simple to define the with- and without-project situations, because of political uncertainties of relevant&#13;
final decisions, and because of the complicated interrelations that exist among different variables in the&#13;
subway and in the avenue on top of it. Clearly, surface transportation and the subway act as an&#13;
integrated system, diverting traffic volumes from one to another as a result of operating conditions in&#13;
both. Consequently, the following scenarios were analyzed: (a) with exclusive bus lanes on avenue&#13;
Rivadavia, located right over the subway alignment, for the same total length of Line A (Plaza de Mayo -&#13;
Primera Junta); (b) the same arrangement but for half of the total length (Plaza de Mayo - Pueyrred6n);&#13;
and (c) without exclusive bus lanes. These three cases were considered for both the with- and without-&#13;
project situations, which makes a total of six scenarios analyzed. The lowest Internal Economic Rate of&#13;
Return was 20 percent for the scenario with total exclusive bus lane in both with- and without-project&#13;
situations. The other scenarios gave results between 25 percent and 74 percent.&#13;
E. Investment Program of the Metrovias Concession&#13;
17.   The 1992 tender documents for the subway/Urquiza concession included a detailed investment&#13;
program, which is now part of the Government's concession agreement with Metrovias. A US$142.9&#13;
million slice (about three years, 1997-1999) of that program would be considered part of the project, of&#13;
which US$50 million would be funded from the proceeds of the World Bank loan. In accordance with the&#13;
concession contract, US$399 million is the amount Metrovias will receive for the completion of the 20-&#13;
year investment program, regardless of the actual amount it would have to pay to the contractors. That&#13;
amount was part of Metrovias' proposal, and it was presented in a competitive environment. There is no&#13;
adjustment for taxes or physical contingencies, and only price contingency, based on the variation of the&#13;
Consumer Price Index of the USA, is allowed. In accordance with Article 3.13 (a) of the Bank&#13;
Procurement Guidelines, works and goods required for the basic investment program would be procured&#13;
by Metrovias, using its own procedures, because the selection of that concessionaire had been done by&#13;
the Govemment, in a manner acceptable to the Bank, following a competitive process.&#13;
18.   The basic investment program which would be supported by the World Bank loan spans from&#13;
1994, the beginning of the concession, to 1999, its sixth year. It includes 49 components: 30 for the&#13;
subway and 19 for the Urquiza railway line. The total amount is US$248 million (as presented in the&#13;
proposal and agreed thereafter), with a clear predominance of the subway system (US$220 million, 88&#13;
percent of the total). Out of this program, the Bank-financed slice would include components to be&#13;
executed between the second half of 19961 and 1999, either already under construction or to be started.&#13;
19.   The specific improvements, for both the subway (Lines B, C, D and E) and the Urquiza railway&#13;
line, would include: (a) partial track renewal on subway lines B, C and E and along 24 km of the Urquiza&#13;
Line; (b) renovation of electric substations and transmission systems; (c) automatic signals and&#13;
operations control center; (d) subway station improvements, including the installation or rebuilding of&#13;
escalators, improvements of ventilation and drainage systems, construction of a new technological&#13;
center, improvements of transfer centers; and (e) repair and reconstruction of eight electric coaches in&#13;
the Urquiza railway line.&#13;
20.   The improvements under the basic investment program are being implemented by Metrovias,&#13;
either with its own resources or subcontracting with others. Metrovias presents monthly to the&#13;
Govemment certificates of construction work and goods delivered, which should be approved by the&#13;
Gerencia Ferroviaria de la Comision Nacional de Regulaci6n de Transporte. Once approved, the&#13;
Govemment pays Metrovias. All payments have been made in a timely manner since the beginning of&#13;
the concession. Supervision, certification and payments would continue to be done in the same fashion&#13;
and provide the basis for financing by the Bank.&#13;
Rroactive financing of up to US$20 million would pay for expenditures incurred after July 1, 1996 or one year prior to loan signing,&#13;
whihwer is lter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-41 -                                 ANNEX B&#13;
21.   The Bank would finance 35 percent of each certificate up to a total aggregate amount of US$50&#13;
million, and the Govemment would finance the rest. Based on the expected work scheduling, it is&#13;
estimated that the Bank loan for this program would be exhausted in 1999, and after that thereafter the&#13;
Govemment would have to finance 100 percent of the certificates.&#13;
22.   The economic evaluation of the whole package of concessions by Metrovias (Urquiza railway&#13;
line and the subway) aims to evaluate, in a global way, the advantages of private over public&#13;
management of business. This comparison was carried out between the With' and Without' project&#13;
situations, taking as the project, the concession program itself. The Without" situation was devised&#13;
assuming a continuation of public management during the 20-year concession. The assumptions for this&#13;
case were based on the performance of the subway and Urquiza Line during the last 10 years before the&#13;
concession started. Between 1984 and 1993 (Metrovias started the concession on January 1, 1994)&#13;
traffic demand for the Urquiza line dropped from 27.3 million to 16.8 million paying passengers, at an&#13;
annual rate of -4.7 percent, while for the subway it came down from 191 million to 145 million, or an&#13;
annual decrease of -2.7 percent. For the evaluation, in the Without' case it was assumed,&#13;
conservatively, that the 1995 volumes would remain constant for the concession period. The With"case&#13;
includes projections and financial results presented by Metrovias in its economic proposal at the time of&#13;
bidding.&#13;
23.   The Net Present Value, at a 12 percent discount rate, of Govemment expenses during the 20-&#13;
year concession period in the Without'situation amounts to US$401 million, while in the With'situation&#13;
the comparable amount is US$162 million, which gives an attractive difference of US$239 million.&#13;
F. Integration of the Transport System&#13;
24.   This program aims to help develop an integrated urban transport system in Buenos Aires,&#13;
through improvements in the vicinity of certain railway stations. This program would complement works&#13;
at transfer stations which have already been agreed under the concession agreements; it would include:&#13;
(a) improvements near outlying rail stations in the Municipality of Buenos Aires, where street and&#13;
pedestrian access investments are likely to yield high retums; (b) improvements near rail stations in the&#13;
Province of Buenos Aires to ease the access for buses, cars, pedestrians, and bicycles, and, eventually,&#13;
provide adequate parking facilities for them; and (c) other station improvements, especially where&#13;
improved transfer conditions between two rail lines or between rail and road-based transport would yield&#13;
significant benefits.&#13;
25.   Improved integration would permit: (a) passenger time and cost savings; (b) increases in the&#13;
ridership of mass transit as opposed to the utilization of private cars; (c) attainment of higher utilization&#13;
factors of vehicles providing feeder services to railways; (d) increase the traffic demand of the&#13;
concessioned rail services; and (e) improvements in the overall efficiency of urban transport services.&#13;
26.   Fourteen rail stations have been pre-selected to improve the transfer conditions among different&#13;
modes. A preliminary analysis has been carried out for each pre-selected station, broadly identifying the&#13;
main issues, and making some preliminary recommendations on possible improvements. By loan&#13;
effectiveness, it is expected that eight sketch plans and functional standards would be defined.&#13;
Preliminary engineering studies, including preliminary cost estimates and traffic regulation, are under&#13;
preparation. Feasibility studies and preparation of bidding documents would be carried out during project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
27.   This subproject would be defined as a sectoral program; that is, each component does not need&#13;
to be precisely defined before loan approval, but the selection and evaluation criteria should be agreed&#13;
beforehand, including the main parameters to be considered. The set of criteria and procedures to&#13;
appraise each component would be defined in an Operational Manual, to be agreed with the Bank prior&#13;
to subproject implementation. The Manual's main objective would be to guide the UEP in appraising this&#13;
program. This group of components would comprise high-priority, transfer station-related investments&#13;
already identified by the Govemment, but requiring further studies to confirm their technical, economic,&#13;
operational, environmental and financial justification. A comprehensive understanding between the Bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX B                                    - 42 -&#13;
and Govemment would be reached and described in the Operational Manual on how this kind of project&#13;
would be selected, appraised, prepared, contracted and executed.&#13;
28.    The total project amount included for this program would be US$35.9 million, inclusive of taxes,&#13;
physical and price contingencies. After a scheme has been appraised and selected for possible&#13;
execution, based on the relevant contents of the Operational Manual, final designs and other aspects of&#13;
detailed project preparation would be carried out, including public participation exercises and&#13;
discussion/negotiations with the rail concessionaire, Municipality, and other involved agencies. Once&#13;
these participants have signed their agreements, which would include, inter alia, maintenance and&#13;
operation responsibilities after the construction is finished, construction tenders would be let on a first-&#13;
come-first-served basis, until the budget is fully committed. The possibility of tendering the specific&#13;
transfer center for private finance and construction, in exchange for offering those parties privileges in&#13;
real estate development, is being analyzed by the Govemment.&#13;
29.   The UEP, in close contact with representatives of the relevant municipalities and the railway&#13;
concessionaires, would be responsible for project preparation, tendering, contractor selection, contract&#13;
award and supervision of works. It would also take the lead in negotiating and formalizing agreements&#13;
with the municipalities and concessionaires. Relevant municipalities and the concessionaires would be&#13;
invited to participate in the revision of detailed engineering and final bidding documents. During&#13;
construction, each municipality would take necessary measures to facilitate the construction works,&#13;
including temporary traffic management measures, and would obtain the required work permits. The&#13;
concessionaires would commit themselves to take action to facilitate the construction.&#13;
G. Traffic Safety&#13;
30.   The objective of this program is to improve traffic safety in several aspects of urban transport,&#13;
with the ultimate aim of reducing the number of accidents. Specific objectives are to: (a) reduce&#13;
vehicular and pedestrian accidents at the current at-grade crossings, which would be closed; (b) facilitate&#13;
uninterrupted road vehicle traffic by providing grade-separated crossings; (c) eliminate current at-grade&#13;
crossing accidents that cause damage to rail equipment; (d) eliminate interruptions to rail traffic as a&#13;
result of either accidents or stopped vehicles in current at-grade crossings; (e) reduce air pollution due to&#13;
vehicles stopped while waiting for the barriers to be lifted; and (f) in some cases, increase rail capacity by&#13;
providing a whole corridor free of at-grade crossings.&#13;
31.    The program is composed of the following components: (a) construction of grade-separated road&#13;
crossings over/under suburban railway lines; (b) installation of automatic barriers at selected road/rail&#13;
crossings which are now without controls; and (c) technical assistance in the following: (i) definition of a&#13;
rehabilitation program of those grade crossings that currently have automatic barriers which do not&#13;
comply with norms; (ii) preparation of a comprehensive strategy to improve the safety at grade crossings&#13;
between the road and rail systems.&#13;
32.   The total project amount included for this program would be about US$60 million, inclusive of&#13;
taxes, physical and price contingencies.&#13;
33.   It is envisaged that 10 to 12 grade-separated crossings would be financed with the money&#13;
available in the project. They would be selected from a larger list of up to 20 possible locations, which is&#13;
now under evaluation. The economic return would be the prevailing criterion for selecting sites, with due&#13;
consideration for the economic consequences of mitigating environmental and other deficiencies. An&#13;
environment screening exercise was carried out, and the main result is that, in general, the environment&#13;
problems identified are likely to be solved by project adjustments, which may impose an extra&#13;
investment cost to be reflected in the economic evaluation.&#13;
34.   The amount estimated for installing automatic barriers is about US$2.7 million, inclusive of&#13;
taxes, and contingencies. It would consist of the installation of around 13 automatic barriers, complying&#13;
with the existing norms in the suburban rail lines that at present lack protection or signaling. The&#13;
estimated cost includes the procurement of the electro-mechanic and electronic equipment, minor civil&#13;
works, and pavement rehabilitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-43-                                  ANNEX B&#13;
35.   This subproject would also be defined as a sectoral program, of the same nature as explained for&#13;
the transport system integration. Most of the aspects covered in paras. 27 through 29 apply, and are not&#13;
mentioned here to avoid repetition. In particular, it would be necessary to prepare another Operational&#13;
Manual, and the agents involved in project implementation would fulfill exactly the same function as&#13;
explained earlier.&#13;
H. Strengthening of the Institutional Framework&#13;
36.   The overall objective of this program is to strengthen the institutional framework to facilitate the&#13;
continuous operation of an economically and environmentally sustainable transport system in the AMBA.&#13;
Five main areas would be included in this program: (a) improvement of the institutional framework; (b)&#13;
improvement of air quality; (c) a transport study; and (d) formulation of urban and suburban traffic&#13;
improvements; and (e) a training program.&#13;
37.   The lack of coordination among the different actors responsible for urban/suburban transport in&#13;
Buenos Aires has been one of the major problems for years. There have been overlapping&#13;
responsibilities, contradictions, poor decisions, and areas that no one is responsible for, as a result of the&#13;
coexistence of different jurisdictions with decision power in the city (and sometimes with opposite or&#13;
contradictory interests). In an aHtempt to improve this situation, a temporary planning unit (commonly&#13;
known as Pre-ATAM) was created in 1991 to serve as a foundation of a permanent entity Autorndad de&#13;
Transporte del Area Metropolitana (ATAM), which was to be composed of representatives of the National&#13;
Govemment, the Municipality of Buenos Aires, and the Province of Buenos Aires. ATAM was to be&#13;
responsible for coordinating policies and regulating the city transport. The establishment of ATAM was&#13;
passed by one chamber of the Congress but is very unlikely to be passed by the other.&#13;
38.   Over the years, Pre-ATAM has been acting successfully in an inforrnal way as a coordination&#13;
entity, with success in specific decisions such as the creation of dedicated bus lanes. However, efforts&#13;
should be intensified to achieve beHter coordination among entities, such as the National, Provincial and&#13;
Municipal Secretariats responsible for transport and roads. Positive changes have recently been&#13;
introduced, such as the merging of the Transport and Public Works Secretariat of the National&#13;
Govemment into SOPyT, and the creation of the Undersecretariat of Metropolitan and Long-Distance&#13;
Transport under SOPyT; the Pre-ATAM group was recently renamed TUAMBA.&#13;
39.   The Govemment's thinking is that the staff of TUAMBA, plus the local counterpart staff of the&#13;
urban transport study would become, in the long run, the foundation for the future Urban Transport&#13;
Planning Agency. In the short run, the UEP, as part of its role in project implementation, would continue&#13;
to handle these maHters in the context of specific project components, which would serve as a kind of&#13;
pilot schemes that in a certain area would test the best way to achieve coordination among the different&#13;
agencies involved. To provide guidance to the transport study, the Govemment intends to create an&#13;
inter-agency Steering Committee with a view to strengthen metropolitan transport planning on a&#13;
permanent basis.&#13;
40.   The large increase in vehicle utilization and the accelerated deterioration of public transport&#13;
units, especially in the high-density areas, have caused a significant increase in traffic congestion, with&#13;
the resulting aggravation of environmental problems in air quality and noise levels. A recent World Bank&#13;
study on Environmental Problems in Argentina2 has identified these problems as serious, and has also&#13;
indicated that relevant information is scarce and incomplete.&#13;
41.   A study was carried out to assess the needs to establish an air quality monitoring system in the&#13;
Federal District, recommend a system, and estimate its cost. Also, the study recommended an&#13;
appropriate institutional framework to maintain and operate the system. The UEP would be responsible&#13;
for procuring the monitoring system, which is estimated to cost around US$3 million, inclusive of taxes&#13;
and contingencies.&#13;

42.   The last comprehensive transport study of the AMBA was carried out in 1970, when the overall&#13;
transport situation was entirely different. Moreover, relevant data have not been, in general, updated&#13;
since that time, and consequently there exists at present a significant gap that jeopardizes any planning&#13;
exercise. Consequently, it is essential to carry out a transport study, including a comprehensive origin-&#13;
destination survey and the development of adequate computer models that, when properly calibrated,&#13;
would represent actual behavior and would permit testing policy strategies. Terms of reference to hire a&#13;
consulting firm for this study have been prepared. The total estimated cost is US$8-10 million, including&#13;
taxes and contingencies. The UEP would supervise this study and contract consultants in accordance&#13;
with World Bank guidelines.&#13;
43.   Another area requiring attention is the improvement of traffic conditions generally, a subject that&#13;
was studied in detail by the Emergency Traffic Committee appointed in 1994 by the National&#13;
Govemment. Pre-ATAM formulated several recommendations over the past two years. The technical&#13;
assistance subproject would support similar analyses that deal with bus priorities, traffic control,&#13;
management of traffic demand and improvement in pedestrian circulation.&#13;
44.   Finally, a training program would be implemented aimed at strengthening the capacity of&#13;
Argentine professionals, through participation in courses and seminars abroad as well as in-country. One&#13;
govemment employee per year would be sent abroad to, inter alia, urban railway agencies, subway&#13;
companies, and planning agencies. One selected professional every two years would be sent to a&#13;
reputable foreign university for postgraduate studies in urban transport. Three courses in Argentina would&#13;
be organized covering subjects such as transport planning, operation, institutional arrangements,&#13;
modeling, safety and the environment. The first of these courses would be funded by the PPF and be&#13;
organized by the UEP. The total estimated cost of the training program is US$2.8 million.&#13;
45.   The TUAMBA group, responsible for metropolitan transport planning-initially as counterparts of&#13;
the transport study-would be financed in its totality by the Government. The World Bank loan would pay&#13;
for consultants, extemal technical assistance, and training. Total subproject costs are estimated to&#13;
amount to US$30 million and cover equipment, technical assistance and training, with taxes and&#13;
contingencies included.&#13;
I. Project Management&#13;
46.   The UEP would include about 20 professionals and carry out the tasks described in para. 9.&#13;
above. It would be funded from the World Bank loan at an estimated cost of US$7.6 million.&#13;

BUENOS AIRES URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX D: IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE, MONITORING INDICATORS, AND PROJECT&#13;
SUPERVISION&#13;
A. Project Implementation Schedule&#13;
1.    The implementation plan of individual components is shown in Table Di. Together with the&#13;
detailed cost table of Annex C, it provides the basis for project monitoring and for the disbursement&#13;
profile.&#13;
2.    The UEP will monitor compliance with the individual implementation schedules by defining target&#13;
dates for key actions. It will be responsible for updating these targets and will discuss the actual&#13;
implementation progress along with any changes in the implementation plan in the semiannual progress&#13;
reports. These reports should measure advancement in the implementation of the project by linking&#13;
actual progress with the updated plan.&#13;
3.    To assist itself in monitoring compliance with the project implementation schedule, the UEP will&#13;
develop and implement a computerized project management system. The system should be user friendly&#13;
and be updated constantly. The semi-annual progress reports should be based on the outputs of the&#13;
project management system.&#13;
B. Monitoring and Evaluation of Project Components&#13;
4.    Monitoring would identify the physical, institutional and financial status of each subproject&#13;
component, as appropriate, on a periodic basis. The aim would be to identify implementation problems&#13;
and the extent of deviation from the previously agreed targets. The results of the monitoring program&#13;
(the comparison of achieved performance with agreed targets) will be presented in the semiannual&#13;
Progress Reports prepared by the UEP. The monitoring of each component will provide the basis and&#13;
information for the UEP to prepare measures and actions to resolve implementation problems, if any,&#13;
and at the same time, to update project costs, disbursement and implementation schedules, if necessary.&#13;
Monitoring indicators to be employed will vary by type of component but the general guidelines are set&#13;
out below:&#13;
(a)    prepare an implementation schedule which sets out target dates for key actions for&#13;
physical works, equipment supply and institutional components;&#13;
(b)   the target dates would define the start and finish of key actions (to the nearest quarter);&#13;
(c)   for financial performance, give target "percentage completed" by quarter. These dates&#13;
will be used for calculating disbursement performance; and&#13;
(d)   to the extent possible, use the performance indicators included in the Metrovias&#13;
concession agreement.&#13;
5.    Ex-post evaluation would be aimed at determining the effectiveness and efficiency of measures&#13;
in meeting the objectives agreed upon at negotiations. In the event that objectives are not met and&#13;
previously anticipated improvements in performance are not achieved, the data would be used to: (a)&#13;
identify why components had not been fully successful; and (b) modify future components proposed for&#13;
subsequent implementation which were based on similar premises. Furthermore, the ex-post evaluation&#13;
would be used as a major input to the project Implementation Completion Report. Tables D2 and D3&#13;
show respectively the qualitative and quantitative performance measures which have been established&#13;
for the project.&#13;
C. Supervision Plan&#13;
6.    Bank supervision of project implementation would be particularly important during the first three&#13;
years of the project, when significant institutional and procurement decisions would be occurring. The&#13;
&#13;

bulk of disbursements are also expected during the initial years. The Bank would conduct two&#13;
supervision missions each year; the second of these missions would be used for the planned Annual/Mid-&#13;
Term Review. Staffing for these missions would normally Include the task manager, a financial&#13;
analyst/specialist, a transport planner, and a procurement specialist. A total of about 50 staff-weeks&#13;
would be required each year for the first two years, thereafter decreasing to 25 staff-weeks in the third&#13;
year and 15 staff weeks for the fourth year until the end of the project. A Mid-Term Review of the project&#13;
is planned for 1999 to examine the progress made, especially in the urban transport study, and policies&#13;
to assess the relevance of project objectives and actions, and recommend appropriate revisions, as&#13;
needed. In addition, the UEP staff is also envisioned to visit Washington once a year to discuss project&#13;
related issues and receive guidance on Bank procedures. A summary of key inputs is provided in Table&#13;
D4.&#13;
7.    The UEP is also expected to contribute to the supervision effort by: (a) being responsible for&#13;
project monitoring and coordination, keeping the Project Monitoring System accurate, and following-up&#13;
and addressing all issues which are brought to attention by the system; (b) properly managing all&#13;
procurement and disbursement considerations, keeping procurement and disbursement records up-to-&#13;
date; (c) submitting progress reports within one month of the end of June and December of each year,&#13;
and (d) coordinating arrangements for the Bank supervision missions.&#13;

BUENOS AIRES URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX F: SUMMARY OF URBAN TRANSPORT STUDY TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.    Buenos Aires is the capital and administrative center of Argentina. The Metropolitan Area of&#13;
Buenos Aires (AMBA) holds the main economic, commercial and industrial activities of the country. The&#13;
AMBA consists of the federal capital and 42 other municipalities, covering an area of over 16,000 km'.&#13;
Its 12 million inhabitants (one-third of the total population of Argentina) make an estimated total of 18&#13;
million daily trips, 60 percent of them using mass transit. The AMBA's 200 non-subsidized private bus&#13;
companies make up 42 percent of the motorized trips and carry more than 80 percent of public&#13;
transportation passengers.&#13;
2.    Congestion is, however, increasing and spreading along the road network during peak periods,&#13;
especially in the central area. The car portion of the motorized trips modal split has increased from 15&#13;
percent in 1970 to an estimated 34 percent in 1995. This trend does not show signs of change; thus&#13;
congestion will contribute to further deterioration of bus operations and environmental conditions.&#13;
3.    Another problem is that the organization of urban transport in the AMBA is fragmented. National,&#13;
provincial and municipal levels of government have overlapping responsibilities and little coordination.&#13;
Efforts to develop a fully integrated public transport system are at an early stage. Apart from the financial&#13;
limitations, the transport sector suffers from the lack of tools and appropriate methodologies to evaluate&#13;
altemative policies aimed at subsidizing the decision-making process.&#13;
4.    Future AMBA urban transport activities will demand a significant improvement in the planning&#13;
and management of the metropolitan transport system in order to guarantee overall gains in efficiency.&#13;
5.    Accessibility to crucial trip generating areas has to be improved. New transfer routes providing&#13;
direct connections between suburbs will have to be considered. Special attention must be given to the&#13;
resulting impacts of transport policies, particularly traffic-related pollution and the disruption of pedestrian&#13;
flows within central areas of Buenos Aires.&#13;
B. Introduction&#13;
6.    Given the size and importance of Buenos Aires along with the scope and time frame of the&#13;
study, prospective respondents to this invitation for proposals ought to consider this as a major&#13;
opportunity to foster the advancement of transport planning and modeling practice. It is expected that the&#13;
proposed methodology would maximize quality and results within the budget and time constraints.&#13;
7.    These Terms of Reference focus on specifying the expected results rather than setting strict&#13;
methodological guidelines. Detailed requirements conceming procedures adopted in current best&#13;
practices are thus omitted, as these are expected to be known by the consultants. This approach offers&#13;
considerable flexibility to devise a methodology suitable to attain the desired objectives. Nonetheless, it&#13;
requires that the proposals contain a complete description and justification of the methodology,&#13;
addressing its possibilities and limitations conceming the accomplishment of study objectives.&#13;
8.    The UEP understands that the size and complexity of the study may preclude a detailed&#13;
description of all aspects of the methodology in the proposal. It thus accepts that only key&#13;
methodological considerations will be detailed at this stage, so long as the resulting proposal leaves no&#13;
room for doubts as to the quality of the proposed work and its potential to fulfill the expectations detailed&#13;
in these Terms of Reference. It must be clear that this approach requires that the selected consultants&#13;
submit further methodological details for the approval of the UEP during the course of the study.&#13;
C. Objectives&#13;
9.    The general objective is to conduct an Urban Transport Study (URTRAS) for the AMBA. The&#13;
specific objectives include:&#13;
(a)   the development of a Buenos Aires Transport Model System (BATAM);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX F                                   - 56 -&#13;
(b)   the conducting of a comprehensive home interview and complementary surveys in order&#13;
to provide the updated information required by the different stages of the analysis,&#13;
modeling and evaluation processes;&#13;
(c)   the evaluation of a set of specific strategies addressing the major transport issues in the&#13;
AMBA including investments in road and rail systems, bus services and network&#13;
structure, intra and intermodal integration, public and private transport pricing policies&#13;
(including congestion pricing); and&#13;
(d)   the development of an institutional framework for metropolitan-wide transport planning.&#13;
10.   The study area will comprise the whole of the AMBA, including the federal capital and the 42&#13;
other municipalities. Analysis, results and recommendations from the URTRAS must address transport&#13;
problems in the study area.&#13;
D. The Urban Transport Study&#13;
11.   In order to achieve the objectives, it is expected that results from the URTRAS should at least&#13;
include:&#13;
(a)   the analysis of current and potential key transportation problems in the AMBA, with the&#13;
identification of their underlying causes and the assessment of their effects on mobility&#13;
and urban development;&#13;
(b)   the identification of objectives for the transport system in agreement with the urban&#13;
development and economic scenarios considered;&#13;
(c)   the definition of a common evaluation framework to assess objectives attainment,&#13;
considering at least operational, economic, financial, environmental, safety, social and&#13;
institutional development aspects, at different levels of details and time frames; and&#13;
(d)    recommendations for the implementation of selected strategies, describing specific&#13;
actions and their estimated time frame and costs.&#13;
12.   The proposals must explicitly address those key methodological issues of their approach&#13;
believed to be essential to achieving the expected results. These should at least include:&#13;
(a)   the procedure for the development of the objectives for the transport system, considering&#13;
a wide range of aspects and interests;&#13;
(b)   the procedure for the generation of altemative transport strategies potentially capable of&#13;
achieving the objectives;&#13;
(c)   the procedure for the generation of planning scenarios, in accordance with urban&#13;
development and economic hypotheses adopted and for dealing with uncertainties in&#13;
these hypotheses;&#13;
(d)   the procedures for consistently transforming planning scenarios (usually set at the&#13;
general level) into inputs to transport modeling and analysis (required at a spatially&#13;
dissaggregated level); and&#13;
(e)   the overall modeling approach to be adopted for simulating the actions combined in&#13;
strategies.&#13;
E. The Continuous Transport Planning Process&#13;
13.   Only the implementation of a continuous planning process in the AMBA will allow transport&#13;
problems to be monitored and addressed in a systematic and objective-orientated manner. It is&#13;
envisaged that this study would be the basis for this continuous process.&#13;
14.   To engage in the activities which will be part of the continuous planning and management effort,&#13;
the UEP expects that at the end of this study, a local team would be fully capable of: (a) following and&#13;
anticipating trends in urban development; (b) reevaluating and revising the results of the URTRAS; (c)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-57-                                  ANNEX F&#13;
assisting other agencies; (d) operating the BATAM; (e) implementing modifications in the BATAM; and (f)&#13;
maintaining and expanding an integrated GIS-oriented transport network.&#13;
F. Transport Modeling - BATAM&#13;
15.   The BATAM should support the development of the URTRAS, including the assessment of&#13;
transport strategies and the detailing of actions required for their implementation. BATAM will become&#13;
the technical backbone of the continuous transport planning process and will also be a tool for the local&#13;
technical team to address other urban transport issues from a planning point of view.&#13;
16.   Some of the transport issues to be considered in developing the BATAM are:&#13;
(a)   the need to provide additional road capacity and improve the overall conditions of the&#13;
existing network;&#13;
(b)   the investment in metro/rail transport, including new lines, extensions, dualing of tracks,&#13;
electrification, new rolling stock and signaling;&#13;
(c)   the required improvements to bus transportation, including reshaping of the bus network&#13;
structure and introducing large-scale bus priority measures;&#13;
(d)   the requirement to evaluate the implementation of additional transfer terminals and the&#13;
relocation of public transport station/terminals;&#13;
(e)   the chance of boosting the integration of transport services, including the metro/rail and&#13;
feeder buses, park and ride, cycle and ride, etc.;&#13;
(f)   the urgency to define patterns of competition among public transport services and&#13;
operators, including those of different quality standards;&#13;
(g)   the need to assess alternative fare policies for public transport, including peak and off-&#13;
peak fares, use of magnetic/smart cards, and specific fare agreements among public&#13;
transport operators;&#13;
(h)   the opportunity for implementing private transport demand management and control&#13;
techniques including road pricing;&#13;
(i)   the importance of alleviating congestion and pollution as well as improving safety;&#13;
0)    the problems pedestrians face while walking in the central areas; and&#13;
(k)   the introduction of new major traffic generators (passengers or freight).&#13;
G. The Origin-Destination Home Interview and Complementary Data Collection&#13;
17.   Buenos Aires has not conducted any systematic data collection on transport for more than two&#13;
decades. Thus a major data collection effort is considered an important part of this study. This will be&#13;
centered on a large-scale origin-destination (O/D) home interview survey, which has to be property&#13;
completed by additional surveys for the purposes of completeness and accuracy.&#13;
18.   Major objectives of the data collection effort are to:&#13;
(a)    provide a description of person and freight travel pattems in the AMBA with regard to&#13;
spatial, temporal, socio-economic and transport characteristics to support policy analysis&#13;
and decision making.&#13;
(b)    provide behavioral data for the development and estimation of travel demand models;&#13;
(c)    provide data for the development and calibration of computer-based transport models;&#13;
(d)    provide up-to-date estimates of socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the&#13;
population of the area; and&#13;
(e)    provide data on economic and other urban activities in the AMBA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX F                                   - 58 -&#13;
19.   The specific objectives of the O/D survey recognize two main uses of the information collected:&#13;
descriptive analysis and modeling. It is thus expected that the survey provides:&#13;
(a)    a description of socio-economic and demographic characteristics at a zone level;&#13;
(b)    a description of travel demand characteristics (e.g., trips by purpose, mode or time of&#13;
day) at a zone level;&#13;
(c)    a description of trip interchanges at the coarse zone level;&#13;
(d)    detailed socio-economic, demographic and travel activity information for demand&#13;
modeling; and&#13;
(e)   trip matrices at a detailed zone level to be used as seeds in matrix adjustment&#13;
procedures.&#13;
20.   To obtain the required information, data must be collected at four levels: dwelling units,&#13;
households, individuals and travel activity. Working day travel activity pattems must be measured.&#13;
Walking and other short distance trips to relevant activities must be recorded. Bidders may consider the&#13;
need for a sub-sample of the sampled households to be approached in order to gather more specific data&#13;
which might be required for modeling or other purposes.&#13;
H. Products&#13;
21.   The products of the study will comprise: reports in Spanish and English; computer models;&#13;
technical seminars to discuss the work progress; methodologies and findings on a bi-monthly basis;&#13;
databases and manuals; and hardware.&#13;
22.   The reports will include inception reports, monthly progress reports, working notes, intermediate&#13;
reports, draft final reports, final reports, and summary reports.&#13;

ANNEX G: ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
1.    The concession awarded to Metrovias involved the rehabilitation and operation, over a period of&#13;
20 years, of the subway network and the Urquiza suburban railway which connects with it. One of the&#13;
terms of the concession was that Line A of the subway was to be rehabilitated on the Govemment's&#13;
account. The present project consists of the investments necessary for the Govemment to meet that&#13;
obligation. If the investment were not to be made, the whole concession would be at risk. Economic&#13;
evaluation was thus applied both to the concession as a whole and to the Line A rehabilitation itself.&#13;
2.    Line A, which was built in   Table GI: Main Assumptions and Results of the Economic&#13;
1913, remains in operation with 65-                      Evaluation&#13;

4.    The project includes total replacement of the rails, renovation of the electrical supply system,&#13;
renewal of the signaling system, installation of forced ventilation, renovation of the pumps, improvement&#13;
of the tunnels to take longer coaches, and some minor complementary works. Although the replacement&#13;
of the rolling stock is part of the program to be undertaken by Metrovias under the terms of the&#13;
concession agreement, the cost of this rolling-stock replacement is included in the cost of renovation of&#13;
the line for the purposes of this economic evaluation.&#13;
5.    The proposed investment program also includes a sum of about US$6 million for the civil works&#13;
involved in constructing a new station to replace two existing stations (Piedras and Lima). The benefits of&#13;
this part of the project would come partly from improving the interchange between Lines A and C, partly&#13;
from creating some opportunities for the exploitation of new commercial space, and partly from lowering&#13;
the trains' turn-around time because of the elimination of one scheduled stop in each direction. No&#13;
separate economic evaluation has been undertaken to estimate the additional benefits of the station&#13;
consolidation.&#13;

6.    The terms of the concession as a whole specified minimum levels of service and the fare levels&#13;
at which that service was to be provided. It also specified a program of investments to be undertaken on&#13;
the account of the concessionaire. Provisions were made for fare adjustments to take inflation into&#13;

account, and to recognize improvements of service quality above the minimum required in the contract.&#13;
Bidders were required to specify timings and costing for the program of investments and to indicate other&#13;
payments which they would require (operating subsidies) or are willing to make (canon) during the period&#13;
of the concession. The concession was awarded to the bidder offering the stream of expenditures and&#13;
revenues to Govemment involving the minimum net present value when discounted at 12 percent which&#13;
represented the opportunity cost of capital to the Govemment.&#13;
7.     The basic assumption made in the appraisal of the concession is that, without the concession,&#13;
the subway would continue to run at the initial level of service, with annual expenditures by Govemment&#13;
equal to those made in the final year before concessioning. This is treated as the «do-nothing" case. In&#13;
the year prior to concessioning, the subway carried 145 million passengers, generating US$85.39 million&#13;
in traffic revenue, in addition to US$2.53 million of non-traffic revenue. Total revenues were thus&#13;
US$67.92 million compared with expenses of US$108.22 million. The direct cost to Government was&#13;
thus over US$40 million. In addition, the Urquiza line, with which the subway is linked in the concession,&#13;
was losing over US$10 million a year, giving a total cost to Govemment of US$53.72 million. It has been&#13;
assumed that these losses would continue in the absence of the concession. The stream of costs and&#13;
revenues to Government for the "with concession' and "without concession" cases are set out in Table&#13;
G3.&#13;
8.    In the years before concessioning, the cost to Govemment had been increasing, while the level&#13;
of service and of patronage had been declining. Moreover, maintenance expenditures were being&#13;
deferred so that the likely future expenditures to keep the system in operation would have had to&#13;
increase in any event. In the case of Line A, the oldest line, it is estimated that inability to maintain&#13;
obsolete equipment would have led to closure within five years. The "constant cost to Government"&#13;
assumption for the status quo is thus very conservative.&#13;

9.    The economic evaluation estimated the discounted expected net present value of the stream of&#13;
payments by Govemment on the assumption of constant subsidy in the absence of the concession&#13;
agreement amounts to US$401 million. The stream of payments under the concession (adding together&#13;
subsidies, capital expenditures and the canon payable) has a net present value of US$162 million. This&#13;
gives a net present value to Govemment of the concession in financial terms of US$239. The rate of&#13;
retum, while not calculated due to the multiple possible results, is considered high. For the purposes of&#13;
these analysis, a discount rate of 12 percent was used which has been universally applied by the&#13;
Govemment in all its concessions so far, and reflects the opportunity cost of capital in Argentina. It is&#13;
worth noting that the NPV of the project would be positive at any discount rate due to positive benefits in&#13;
the beginning years of the concession. In addition, this analysis is based on the shadow price of&#13;
exchange of 1 due to equivalency between US$ and Argentine Peso3. From the fiscal point of view, the&#13;
NPV of the concession represents about 0.5 percent of the current budget of the Govemment.&#13;
10.   The economic value of the concession (assuming that it was the intention of the Govemment to&#13;
maintain subway service if possible) is underestimated by this calculation in three ways.&#13;
11.   First, even on the basis of the traffic figures assumed by the concessionaire in making the bid,&#13;
there would be an increase in subway traffic which would, in tum, reduce the need for bus services.&#13;
Although it would be double counting to include the reduction of costs of bus operation as well as the&#13;
additional revenues to the subway of traffic diverted, the increase of consumers' surplus for passengers&#13;
transferring as well as the environmental and safety benefits associated with the reduced levels of road&#13;
traffic are a net addition to the benefits of the concession.&#13;
12.   Second, the effect of the improved quality of service provided by the concessionaire has already&#13;
attracted more traffic than forecast. That implies that these additional passengers are also obtaining&#13;
benefits from transferring to the subway. Passenger volumes on the subway in the third year of the&#13;
concession were equal to the level projected for year eight in the concessionaire's bid. As might be&#13;
expected, the concessionaire claims that this has been achieved as a consequence of increased levels&#13;
of service provision, which have associated increases in operational expense, and thus profit has not&#13;
been increased.&#13;
13.   Third, it has been proposed that increases in subway fares introduced by Govemment to match&#13;
increases in bus fares (but not the increases associated with inflation of supply costs or improvement of&#13;
subway service provided for in the contract) would accrue to Govemment and be paid into an urban&#13;
transport fund.&#13;
14.   The main caveat that should be made on these calculations is that it has been assumed&#13;
throughout that the maintenance of subway service at the new level of cost to Govemment is a socially&#13;
worthwhile expenditure. That supposition has not been tested in the cost-benefit analysis for the&#13;
concession as a whole. However, the results of the analysis of the investment in Line A, which do include&#13;
the costs and benefits to all users of the urban transport network in the affected area (but still not any&#13;
environmental benefits to non-users) strongly supports the case that the overall benefit of having the&#13;
subway is positive. The financial details of the concession agreement are shown in Table G12.&#13;
B. Evaluation of the Line A Infrastructure Investments&#13;
15.   The evaluation procedure used is a conventional cost-benefit analysis in which the level and&#13;
performance of traffic in the affected network is estimated with and without the investment under&#13;
consideration over the effective life of the project (taken in this instance to be the 20 years of the&#13;
concession). The basic calculation only covered a single direction of traffic-outward along Avenida&#13;
Rivadavia. The total benefits of the project should be at least double this because the inward joumey in&#13;
the corridor is forced to use parallel streets of lower capacity, for which exclusive bus lanes to improve&#13;
3 The same arguments for the choice of the discount rate and the shadow price of th, exchange rate are valid for the evaluation of&#13;
Une A Investments and grade separations.&#13;

performnance are not feasible. The full details of the economic evaluation are contained in the report&#13;
prepared for the Project Coordination Unit.4&#13;
16.   It is assumed that the number of trips taken would be the same with or without the subway (i.e.,&#13;
no allowance is made for newly generated trips). The subway traffic is assumed to increase over the&#13;
period by the attraction of passengers from the bus mode. The benefit calculation involves estimates of&#13;
the total costs of carrying this traffic throughout the study period with and without the Line A&#13;
rehabilitation.&#13;
17.   Traffic which would be carried on the subway in the With project"case is all assumed to be&#13;
carried by bus in the Without project"case. The assignment of all traffic to the buses is based on the&#13;
substantial difference between the costs of subway and buses on the one hand, and taxis or private cars&#13;
on the other. If, in the event, some of the traffic which would use the subway were to be car or taxi traffic&#13;
the level of congestion in the without project case would be higher, and the rate of return on the project&#13;
increased. It is assumed that the extra number of buses required would be determined by the increase in&#13;
peak-hour bus demand. The extra number of buses is thus determined by the extra number of peak-hour&#13;
surface travelers divided by 70 (a very high estimate of peak load). The buses thus brought into the&#13;
system are assumed to operate throughout the 12-hour day evaluated and the extra costs of bus service&#13;
derived from this.&#13;
18.    The costs of operation of traffic in the Avenida Rivadavia corridor were estimated with and&#13;
without Line A in operation. The costs included were:&#13;
(a)    costs of operation of road vehicles on Avenida Rivadavia;&#13;
(b)   time costs of users of public and private transport on Avenida Rivadavia; and&#13;
(c)    costs of maintenance and operation of Line A (for the 'with, project case only).&#13;
19.   The traffic data were converted into monetary terms using standard conventions such as speed-&#13;
flow relationships, vehicle operating cost estimates, and values of time. In the absence of a&#13;
comprehensive traffic model, the analysis provided only for shifts of traffic between modes (particularly&#13;
between subway and buses) and between routes (particularly between Avenida Rivadavia and other&#13;
routes). For the purposes of the estimation, it was assumed that traffic on Line A continued to decline at&#13;
20 percent per annum as performance deteriorated over five years, after which the Line would be closed.&#13;
20.    The costs of operation of private vehicles, taxis and buses were estimated as a function of travel&#13;
speed. Conventions for these calculations were taken from a 1995 study of travel in Buenos Aires. Full&#13;
details are available in the project files.5&#13;
21.    The unit values of time used in the evaluation were based on the FIEL study (FIEL, op. cit.). The&#13;
values of working time calculated for auto users was US$7.20 per hour and US$2.80 per hour for mass&#13;
transport users, giving an average value of US$4.50 for all users. These were used for joumeys in the&#13;
course of work only. For other journeys (to and from work, and leisure and other trips) a value of 20&#13;
percent of the value of working time was taken. No statistical basis was available for the joumey purpose&#13;
for the different modes: the assumption made in the study was that 40 percent of auto trips, 35 percent of&#13;
subway trips and 30 percent of bus trips were for work purposes. This gave average values of time for&#13;
auto users of US$3.74 per hour, for subway users of US$1.61 per hour, and for bus users of US$1.23 per&#13;
hour. Average auto occupation was 1.8 per vehicle. The value of time used in auto travel was factored to&#13;
account for that level of occupancy.&#13;

22.    Traffic Estimation. The subway traffic estimate for the base year was derived from a census of&#13;
passengers on Line A taken by Metrovias in September 1994, which, combined with the results of a&#13;
study undertaken in 1990 by the Municipality of Buenos Aires, yielded an origin/destination matrix.&#13;
Hourly distribution of traffic was also provided by Metrovias.&#13;
23.    Road traffic conditions were analyzed separately for five sections of Rivadavia, currently&#13;
carrying varying traffic volumes and modal proportions. Current traffic volumes and capacities are shown&#13;
for these sections in Table G4.&#13;

24.   The performance of traffic on Rivadavia was calculated using speed-flow relationships shown in&#13;
Table G5. It was assumed that when traffic volumes exceeded those bringing the average speed of&#13;
traffic down to 5 km per hour, 67 percent of the excess traffic would divert to the nearest parallel street in&#13;
the same direction (Independencia) and 33 percent would divert to the next nearest (Presidente Per6n).&#13;
The assumption that speeds would decline to 5 km per hour before substantial diversion would occur was&#13;
based on the evidence of other avenues in the city (particularly C6rdoba) where this has occurred, and&#13;
on the basis of the low average speeds achievable on the parallel roads because of their lack of capacity&#13;
and the frequency of intersections.&#13;

25.    The benefit calculations were undertaken on the basis of 12 hours per day. Observed traffic is&#13;
relatively stable through the main working hours; the average hourly traffic over the period being&#13;
assumed to be 0.93 times the peak-hour traffic. The calculation was based on 273 days per year. This&#13;
number of days represented the working days (excluding the weekends and the summer months of&#13;
January and February when traffic volumes are lower) and for which no traffic benefits were assumed.&#13;
26.    A 'hatural rate of growth* of traffic was allowed for in the calculations. This was taken to be&#13;
0.6689 percent per annum.&#13;

suggests that this fomn  of traffic   senernts in one direction only.&#13;
separation and management would be introduced in the near future, at least for the inner portion of the&#13;
route. In the case where an exclusive bus lane was assumed, it was also assumed that stop spacing&#13;
would be increased to 350 meters from the existing range of 200-250 meters. Table G6 shows the&#13;
altematives considered and their respective results. These results are based on a discount rate of 12&#13;
percent which was calculated to be the opportunity cost of capital to the Govemment and was previously&#13;
used in award of the railway concessions. The labor cost was calculated at its shadow price.&#13;
28.    Because the bus lane improves flows in any event, the effect of introducing i reduces the&#13;
calculated rate of return on keeping the Line A open. A range of altematives for the bus lanes, both with&#13;
and without the subway, were considered. Table G7 shows the economic evaluation results of the base&#13;

lane was Introduced over the whole route whether or not the subway was maintained in operation). The&#13;
results of the investigation demonstrate that the altemative project (exclusive bus lane) would still be&#13;
beneficial even if Line A was rehabilitated. The project, however, was considered much superior to the&#13;
alternative since the NPV calculated for the project even when compared to the without situation that&#13;
included a full bus lane was higher that the NPV obtained for just putting the bus lane. It is worth&#13;
remembering, the base case NPV is based on one direction only where as direction does not matter in&#13;
the altemative case. If the two cases were equalized, and assuming the inbound traffic would generate at&#13;
least the same benefits as the outbound traffic on Rivadavia (actually the benefits would be greater&#13;
because of no good alternative on the parallel streets for retuming traffic), the base case and altemative&#13;
project would produce US$676 and US$336 million in net benefits (in present value terms) respectively.&#13;
29.    Sensitivity Analysis. The estimated net present value (and internal rate of retum) for the&#13;
rehabilitation   is  particularly   Table G8: Analysis of Sensitivity of IERR to Traffic Loss and&#13;
sensitive to two different sets of&#13;
assumption. The  first is the                 E        B&#13;

surface modes. The second set  Fullbuslanewithproject&#13;
of assumptions concems whether  Partial bus lane without project&#13;

lane is provided, in both the&#13;
without and with project cases.&#13;
The estimated intemal rates of return for various altematives, combined with the different assumptions of&#13;
interim traffic diversion to surface modes, are shown in Table G8. In this table, benefits are estimated for&#13;
both directions of movement, on the conservative assumption that the benefits for the inbound flow&#13;
would be equivalent to those for the outbound flow.&#13;
30.    No estimation has been made of the environmental impact of the investment. With the present&#13;
poor state of control of gaseous emissions from buses, this is also likely to be high. The introduction of&#13;
improved bus technologies and controls in the future would of course reduce the extra benefit that could&#13;
be attributed to the subway line on environmental grounds.&#13;
31.    Other potential benefits from the rehabilitation of the line include the avoidance of losses through&#13;
accidents. These take two forms. First there is the possibility of a major accident on the subway in the&#13;
years during which an unrefurbished subway line is assumed to continue in operation before its final&#13;
closure. Second, given the much higher rate of accidents per passenger kilometer as road traffic&#13;
increases, the shift of movements from road to rail in comparing the "with subway" and "without subway"&#13;
cases would also be likely to yield substantial benefits.&#13;
32.    The assumptions of equal benefits for the movement in the return direction and the omission of&#13;
any safety or environmental benefits to the Line A rehabilitation are thus very conservative. However,&#13;
even with those very conservative assumptions the estimate of the IERR on the subway investment&#13;
would be 148 percent. This appears at first sight to be a very high rate of return in comparison with the&#13;
&#13;

evidence of retums on other subway investments in the range of 1 0-15 percent.6 However, this does not&#13;
seem so surprising when it is remembered that anything up to 80 percent of the costs of subway&#13;
construction are accounted for by the costs of tunneling, not needed in this case. Moreover, the line&#13;
under consideration is also a central area line where both prospective traffic volumes are high and the&#13;
congestion reduction impact of the diversion of traffic from the surface system (albeit in buses) is also&#13;
likely to be high.&#13;
33.    Social Analysis. In the case of the Urquiza line, the increasing number of paying passengers is&#13;
largely due to the crackdown on fare evasion. In the case of the subway, fare evasion was historically not&#13;
a problem. On the other hand, both the Urquiza line and the subway (as well as other urban railway&#13;
concessions) have benefited highly from increased security in and around stations and in the trains,&#13;
which has helped to attract more passengers to their services. The control of fare evasion on the Urquiza&#13;
line may have affected low-income passengers more than others. However, the average eamings of the&#13;
poorest 10 percent in the AMBA (US$335 per month)7 are relatively high when compared to other Latin&#13;
American countries (in Brazil, for example, the minimum monthly salary is only US$112). On the other&#13;
hand, the AMBA population still enjoys relatively low railway tariffs; on the Urquiza line they are about&#13;
25-40 percent below the tariffs of competing road-based transport. In the case of Line A, the average&#13;
hourly wage for is ridership was calculated as US$2.80 which suggests the control of fare evasion in the&#13;
subway has not caused undue hardship to low-income passengers. Overall, the beneficiaries of the&#13;
project would be mainly public transport users whose average income is substantially below those&#13;
traveling by car.&#13;
C. Economic Evaluation of the Grade Separations&#13;
34.   An economic evaluation was performed on 20 prospective road/rail grade separations even&#13;
though the project is not expected to support more than 10-12 of these. The economic rates of return&#13;
varied between 4.83 and 89.5 percent, with 14 of the grade separations having an IERR above 12&#13;
percent. If the project includes the top 10 grade-separations, the lowest return to be supported by the&#13;
project would be above 20 percent. In terms of NPV (at 12 percent), the cumulative benefit of the top 10&#13;
grade separations will be in the order of US$66 million with a range of US$25 million to US$0.7 million.&#13;
35.    Methodology. The road traffic base for the calculations was obtained from a 24-hour automatic&#13;
count, supplemented by a one-hour classified count during a working day. Where these counts were&#13;
undertaken by a municipal authority, they were done in conformity with a guide on counting methods.&#13;
36.   The rail traffic base for the study was obtained from the concessionaires. This consists of the&#13;
timetable of the trains, together with a calculation of numbers of passengers derived from manipulation&#13;
of an origin-destination matrix of passengers obtained from the concessionaire. From the same sources&#13;
estimates were made of the times for which the barriers are closed to allow the passage of trains.&#13;
37.   Information on accidents at level crossings were obtained from the report Accidents at Level&#13;
Crossings in the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Region, as well as from statistics provided by FEMESA or&#13;
the Argentine Railways.&#13;
38.    Costs and benefits were estimated separately for effects during the period of construction of the&#13;
grade-separated crossings, directly associated with the construction process, and for the subsequent&#13;
period of operation of the crossings.&#13;
39.    Effects During the Period of Construction. The major cost during the period of construction is&#13;
the cost of construction itself.&#13;

40.   Where the location of the new crossing is the same as that of the existing crossing, that crossing&#13;
would have to be closed during the period of construction. The calculation included the costs associated&#13;
with extra travel distance incurred when the existing crossing is closed during construction. For this&#13;
calculation, in the absence of a comprehensive traffic model, a simple reassignment formula was used to&#13;
assign traffic to alternative crossings. On the basis of this reassignment, the increase in time and&#13;
operating costs associated with the works were calculated. In these cases there is also an associated&#13;
benefit in that the costs of guarding the crossing can be avoided immediately. Costs were also calculated&#13;
for the reduction in train speeds in the vicinity of the works during the period of construction.&#13;
41.   Effects During the Period of Operation. The benefits to road users include both vehicle&#13;
operating costs and time costs of passengers. The operating costs were calculated on the basis of the&#13;
official Guide on Studies of the Feasibility of Road Schemes published by the National Directorate of&#13;
Roads. For the time dependent costs, these include 1/3 of the depreciation costs in the case of cars,&#13;
salaries of drivers and assistants, interests on the capital cost of the vehicles, insurance and general&#13;
expenses.&#13;
42.   Estimates of the value of time savings were derived from the FIEL study Financing of the&#13;
Transport Sector in the Metropolitan Region of Buenos Aires. Both of these represent a proportion of the&#13;
average earnings of car and public transport passengers based on a weighted average of working time&#13;
savings, valued at the hourly average wage rate of the groups concemed, and non-working time savings&#13;
(including joumeys to and from work), valued at 20 percent of the wage rate. The treatment of the travel&#13;
time value of unemployed persons may appear to be relatively high, but in general the treatment of time&#13;
savings is considered conservative.&#13;
43.   Accident rates were calculated on the basis of the number of expected accidents without the&#13;
improvements increasing at the rate of increase of vehicles of 3 percent per annum for vehicular&#13;
accidents and at the rate of population growth of 1.4 percent in the case of pedestrian accidents. These&#13;
are conservative assumptions, as they make no allowance for the increase in the number of potential&#13;
conflicts which is also a function of the increasing number of trains, and the risk associated with a&#13;
potential conflict which is likely to be a function of train speed.&#13;
44.   The valuation of accident cost              Table G9: Accident Valuations&#13;
savings is based on a study of the annual&#13;
incomes, age and life expectations of    Type of Damage                        Valuation (SJ&#13;

summary the accident valuations are as    Rail damage (Locomotive - Manual Barrier)  16,040&#13;

45.   Each accident causes an interruption of the rail service. This interruption was estimated, on the&#13;
basis of historical data, to be 58 minutes in the case of a vehicle-related accident and 30 minutes In the&#13;
case of a passenger-related accident. The number of trains affected was calculated on the basis of the&#13;
train frequency and the accident type. Passenger time delays were then evaluated on the basis of the&#13;
average load factors and time values discussed earlier.&#13;

46.    Delays to vehicles at barriers were estimated using standard formulae reflecting average arrival&#13;
rates at the barrier, closure time of the barrier, cycle time, and capacity of the level crossing. Estimates&#13;
were also made of the increased operating costs of vehicles, particularly fuel consumed, on account of&#13;
the low speed of movement into and across the grade crossing.&#13;
47.    Savings on the maintenance of barriers replaced were estimated as US$33,846 per manual&#13;
barrier and US$6,000 per automatic barrier. Costs of maintenance of the grade-separated crossings were&#13;
estimated at US$22,500 in years 5 and 15 and US$45,000 in years 10 and 20.&#13;
48.    For the purpose of the economic evaluation, a residual value of 50 percent of the original cost of&#13;
the works was assumed at the end of the period of appraisal (20 years). Sensitivity analyses were&#13;
undertaken halving the value of personal time savings.&#13;
49.    Evaluation Results. As shown below in Table GIO, 14 grade separations were identified as&#13;
being acceptable, based on positive net present values at a discount rate of 12 percent. In the case of&#13;
the two separations on Roca Line (TMR), Larroque-Chacabuco, and Cenito-Garibaldi, additional benefits&#13;
were also calculated due to the fact that with the construction of these two grade separations, the Roca&#13;
Line will be able to close all grade crossings between Constituci6n and Temperley stations thus allowing&#13;
for more frequent rail service. The current level of service is severely constrained by the concession&#13;
agreement which establishes the maximum time for barrier closures, a limit which has already been&#13;
reached. The closure of at-grade crossings would allow TMR to run an extra 100 trains per day by the&#13;
year 1999 which would generate an additional capacity of 57,200 passengers per day. Taking into&#13;
consideration peak and off-peak train frequency, time savings, and feeder services, the extra net&#13;
benefds would amount to over US$7 million per year, as shown in Table G 1.&#13;

BUENOS AIRES URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX H: FINANCIAL EVALUATION&#13;
1.    Metrovias began operating and managing the Buenos Aires subway and the Urquiza line on&#13;
January 1, 1994 under a 20-year concession from the Govemment. Under this arrangement, Metrovias&#13;
operates the subway and the Urquiza line and the Government (i.e., FEMESA in the case of the Urquiza&#13;
line and the Municipality of Buenos Aires in the case of the subway) continues to own the right-of-way,&#13;
equipment, stations and facilities. Metrovias is expected to manage its affairs as a private enterprise,&#13;
fully assuming the commercial risks associated with the business. Metrovias is a privately-held company&#13;
under Argentine law, and as such, is not required to make its financial accounts available for public&#13;
scrutiny.&#13;
2.    Metrovias was awarded the concession following a competitive process which ranked the offers&#13;
on the basis of minimum net present value of the Government payments (operating subsidy and capital&#13;
investment) required to operate the system at a defined tariff and service level. Since tariffs are fixed by&#13;
the Govemment and cannot be changed by the concessionaire, the profitability of the business depends&#13;
on the Metrovias' ability to lower its operating costs and by generating new traffic. In order to take into&#13;
account the effect of rising prices over the long concession period, the contract, however, provides for an&#13;
automatic adjustment in the subsidy/tariff level (choice of the Government) based on an increase in the&#13;
cost of providing the contractual level of service. Metrovias' winning bid of US$130.2 million was 18&#13;
percent lower than the second-highest bid by Metrobaires.&#13;
3.    The revised financial proposal of Metrovias as part of the concession contract is shown in Table&#13;
Hi. According to the proposal, Metrovias would require a decreasing level of subsidy for the first five&#13;
years of the concession: from about US$21 million in year 1 (1994) to US$2 million in year 5 (1998).&#13;
Thereafter, Metrovias would provide a fee (canon) to the Government for the use of the infrastructure&#13;
facilities on an increasing scale: from about US$5 million in 1999 to US$32 million in 2012 and US$27&#13;
million in 2013. During the concession period, revenues are expected to increase from US$81 million in&#13;
1994 to US$121 million in 2012.&#13;
4.    Metrovias, being a private company, is not required under the Argentine law to disclose its&#13;
financial information. However, Metrovias made available to the Bank its unaudited financial and&#13;
operating results for the first two years of operation, 1994-1995, which are shown in Table H2. These&#13;
results show the concession to be so far a huge success: total revenues were up by about 25 percent in&#13;
each of the operating years; and passengers carried were up by more than 30 percent over 1993. The&#13;
level of ridership attained in 1996 for the subway was equal to that of year 8 (2001) of the proposal.&#13;
While traffic on the Urquiza line has been slow to materialize, compared to 1993, it was up by nearly 40&#13;
percent in 1995. Total revenues in 1995 surpassed the forecast by about US$21 million. Metrovias also&#13;
did well on non-operating revenue which in 1995 was more than double what was assumed in the&#13;
proposal.&#13;
5.    The high growth in ridership and the requirements for taking over the concession also increased&#13;
the cost of providing the service. In 1995, labor costs of US$61 million were 14 percent higher than&#13;
projected, and energy costs were about 40 percent higher. On the other hand, maintenance costs were&#13;
almost 40 percent less than projected. The biggest increase, by about US$13 million, was in the category&#13;
bther expenses"which probably is used to balance the difference between revenues and expenditures to&#13;
the levels indicated in the concession agreement. This balancing between revenues and expenditures is&#13;
made necessary if the concessionaire does not wish to disclose the level of profits from operations. It is&#13;
interesting to note that in the financial proposal for the concession, their is no line item directly referring&#13;
to profit margin, dividends, or retained eamings. It is thus assumed that the profitability of the concession&#13;
is built into the "other expense" and 'management fees' categories.&#13;
6.    An additional possible source of revenue for Metrovias is the savings resulting from undertaking&#13;
the Basic Investment Program on behalf of the Govemment at a price previously defined in the&#13;
concession agreement. Insofar as there are savings in undertaking the Investment Program, they accrue&#13;
to Metrovias. On the other hand, Metrovias is also exposed to the risk of any cost overruns. While no&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX H                                    -71-&#13;
good information is available on the overall financial outcome of undertaking the basic Investment&#13;
Program, it is believed to be a profitable venture for Metrovias. It is worthwhile to note that the ownership&#13;
of Metrovias is dominated by the one of the largest Argentine construction companies, Benito Roggio y&#13;
Asociados.&#13;
7.     Ridership. Under the terms of the concession, tariffs are fixed by the Government and can be&#13;
increased in two ways only: first, by improvement in the service quality, and second, by an increase in&#13;
the cost of providing the service. Quality-based tariff increases are included in the concession agreement&#13;
which quantifies the tariff increase with the level of service. In the case of cost-based tariff increases, the&#13;
annual cost estimates included in the concession agreement are monitored on a monthly basis by&#13;
multiplying each cost category by previously defined indices. The concessionaire is entitled to a tariff&#13;
increase (or an increase in subsidy) equivalent to 90 percent of the cost increase if total costs increase&#13;
by at least 6 percent. A cost-based tariff increase of about 5¢ due for Metrovias was recognized by the&#13;
Government in May 1995 and implemented in August 1996. For the period between May 1995-July&#13;
1996, Metrovias was compensated with an increase in operating subsidy. A quality-based tariff increase&#13;
of 15 percent for the Urquiza line due for Metrovias was also implemented in August 1995.&#13;
8.    Projections. Based on the traffic growth experienced thus far, the traffic forecasts were revised&#13;
(see Chart H1) based on a growth factor of 6 percent in 1997, which decreases to 4 percent during 1998-&#13;
99 because of the planned rehabilitation of Line A. Following the rehabilitation period, total ridership is&#13;
expected to bounce back to a growth of 6 percent in 2000. Thereafter, the annual growth in traffic is&#13;
expected to slow down gradually to 1 percent by 2005. Between 2005 and 2013, traffic is projected to&#13;
grow by 1 percent each year, which is slightly above the normal growth rate of population in Buenos&#13;
Aires. Based on these projections and assuming an average tariff of US$0.50 for the subway and&#13;
US$0.37 for the Urquiza line, Metrovias is expected to earn an additional US$612 million in revenue&#13;
during its 20-year concession period beyond that which was assumed in its concession projections.&#13;
Increases in non-operational revenue are expected to increase the cash intake even further.&#13;
9.    While increased traffic will certainly require higher expenditures, the overall increase in&#13;
expenses is expected to be less than the growth in revenues. While certain categories of expenses such&#13;
as fuel and energy may rise, substantial savings are expected from a decrease in the average age of the&#13;
rolling stock, automation of ticket sales, and a reduction in the labor force.&#13;
10.   Metrovias is also expected to be compensated for the delays in the rehabilitation of Line A,&#13;
which under the concession contract was to be completed by the end of 1997. To make up for these&#13;
delays, Metrovias has requested that the Government advance the procurement of some 84 cars for&#13;
Line A which were originally scheduled for year 11 (2004) of the concession. This would decrease the&#13;
average age of the fleet considerably. Extensive operating cost savings would also result from the&#13;
rehabilitation program itself, which would reduce the number of stations by one, refurbish most of the&#13;
stations, replace the track, and provide new signaling and electric systems.&#13;
11.   Sensitivity Analysis. Using the operating cost estimates established in the concession contract,&#13;
a sensitivity analysis was undertaken to determine the volume of ridership and/or the increase in total&#13;
expenses which may force Metrovias in abandoning the concession. Assuming that the expense items in&#13;
the financial forecast do not include built-in profit margins, the concession would become unattractive to&#13;
the Metrovias, i.e., NPV &lt; 0, under the following three scenarios, or a combination, if during the period&#13;
1997-2013: (a) actual traffic is 35 percent less than the revised forecast; (b) total expenses increase by&#13;
50 percent over the forecast; and (c) actual traffic decreases 3 percent every year over the life of the&#13;
remaining concession. The results of the first three years of the concession suggest that the probability of&#13;
any of these scenarios occurring is rather remote.&#13;

BUENOS AIRES URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 1: ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
A. Key Environmental Issues&#13;
1.    Besides the ongoing works under the Metrovias concession, most physical improvements under&#13;
the project consist of the rehabilitation of existing facilities, mainly the rehabilitation of subway Line A. As&#13;
such, this subproject involves equipment, escalator and workshop renovation and improvement, track&#13;
renewal, electrical equipment, signals and communications, and some civil works. Bidding documents&#13;
will include specific requirements for the management and disposal of construction wastes, earth cuts&#13;
and old equipment.&#13;
2.    The most environmentally sensitive subprojects are those related to: (a) the construction of&#13;
grade-separated road crossings over/under suburban railway lines; and (b) the upgrading of transfer&#13;
stations. These subprojects involve construction works in or near populated areas, with dense&#13;
commercial or residential activities. The environmental work carried out during project preparation&#13;
involved: (a) environmental screening of a set of proposed road crossings; (b) the design of an&#13;
environmental assessment (EA) methodology for projects that may require a more-in-depth&#13;
environmental assessment; and (c) the design of a community consultation methodology for this type of&#13;
project in an urban setting. As a pilot test, both the EA and community consultation methodologies were&#13;
applied to selected grade separations before appraisal. All components to be financed under those&#13;
subprojects will be subject to EA screening, EA, and public consultation according to the agreed&#13;
methodologies. As a result of the pilot EA and consultation exercises, subproject design and construction&#13;
will also follow: (a) a well-defined set of environmental criteria and principles (based on World Bank&#13;
environmental and social policies) for the location, design and construction of road crossings and transfer&#13;
stations, and (b) a set of environmental guidelines for the construction of such civil works in urban areas.&#13;
Specific mechanisms for assuring the application and compliance of all environmental criteria, guidelines&#13;
and methodologies would be spelled out in Operational Manuals, the approval of which by the Bank&#13;
would be a condition of civil works disbursements for the two subprojects.&#13;
B. Environmental Screening and Assessment of Road Crossings&#13;
3.    An environmental screening exercise of about 20 proposed railway-crossing sites was carried out&#13;
during the early stages of project preparation. Most of these projects which were then in a pre-feasibility&#13;
phase, involve the solution of bottlenecks and traffic safety black spots through the construction of&#13;
tunnels (two-way or one-way) and overpasses. The proposed sites were screened for:&#13;
(a)   the need for resettlement of families and businesses;&#13;
(b)    potential interruption or limitation of accesses to dwellings or businesses either&#13;
permanently or temporarily (during construction);&#13;
(c)    encroachment/reduction of green areas, parks, and other recreational areas;&#13;
(d)    demolition of buildings of high architectural or historical value;&#13;
(e)    potential deterioration of urban quality and property value in the immediate vicinity of the&#13;
crossings;&#13;
(f)   the potential for increased accidentality in areas with high density of schools, hospitals,&#13;
and commercial use;&#13;
(g)   the effect on urban infrastructure (sidewalks, power and telephone lines, water and&#13;
sewerage mains, etc.); and&#13;
(h)    potentially unacceptable nuisances during construction (dust, wastes, and heavy&#13;
construction traffic).&#13;
4.    The grade separations schemes were ranked according to their environmental sensitivity for both&#13;
the construction and operational phases classifying them into: (a) those that require more in-depth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I                                   -76-&#13;
analysis during the design phase and must include analysis of altematives and public consultation; and&#13;
(b) those that require specific environmental considerations during the design and construction phase.&#13;
The main conclusions of the screening exercise were: (a) all schemes would be environmentally feasible&#13;
and would solve sensitive urban and traffic problems at the proposed sites; (b) none of the schemes&#13;
would entail the resettlement of population nor impact on areas of ecological or historical value; (c)&#13;
seven schemes required more in-depth environmental analysis including analysis of altematives and&#13;
public consultation; (d) perhaps the most sensitive environmental concem would be the accessibility to&#13;
houses and businesses during construction and operation; (e) there is a deeply felt community concom&#13;
for seriously considering pedestrian needs into the overall solution of the railway crossing; and (f)&#13;
impacts during construction must be properly addressed.&#13;
5.    A methodology for carrying out environmental assessments of this type of works was prepared&#13;
and applied to two proposed crossings: Banfield and Lomas de Zamora. Specific mitigation measures for&#13;
the construction and operation of these crossings, and environmental monitoring programs are identified&#13;
in the report and will be included in final designs and bidding documents. Both EAs are available in&#13;
project files.&#13;
C. Public Consultation&#13;
6.    The screening exercise identified the need for community consultation in the area of influence of&#13;
particularly sensitive crossings. A community consultation methodology was designed which includes an&#13;
opinion survey and a consultation program encompassing broad and specific areas of influence of the&#13;
crossings. The methodology includes specifically designed questionnaires and strategies for: (a) public&#13;
and community organizations; and (b) the community in general. The public and community&#13;
organizations to be consulted include: (a) local professional associations (including engineering and&#13;
architectural associations); (b) local chambers of commerce and industries; (c) community organizations&#13;
(neighborhood organizations) and local NGOs. The public and community in general are further divided&#13;
into two groups: (a) public at large in the area of influence; and (b) affected community in the immediate&#13;
area of the proposed works. The consultation program involves both formal and informal presentations&#13;
and meetings with the target groups, information dissemination campaigns through fliers, posters, and&#13;
radio announcements; and an opinion survey.&#13;
7.    The public consultation methodology was tested on one of the proposed crossings (Ituzaingo).&#13;
The results of the consultation program, the consulted organizations, and the main findings and&#13;
recommendations for this specific site are available in project files. All crossings to be financed under the&#13;
project would required a community consultation program according to the agreed methodology. The&#13;
pilot test at Ituzaingo highlighted and confirmed the benefits of such consultation program through which:&#13;
(a) there is a broad consensus among organized groups, NGOs and the public at large about the need&#13;
for such crossing at that site; (b) specific recommendations for the crossing location and design (for&#13;
instance, relocating one of the tunnel entrance 50 meters further would enhance accessibility to houses)&#13;
have been obtained from meetings and surveys; (c) property owners (about 2) whose accessibility to&#13;
their houses would be permanently diminished have found a mechanism to start a dialogue with the&#13;
municipality as to different compensation strategies; and (d) a sense of ownership has been achieved in&#13;
both the neighborhoods and the municipal institutions. The report on the Ituzaingo consultation is&#13;
available in the project files.&#13;
D. Urban Environmental Principles&#13;
8.    As a result of the environmental screening exercise, the pilot community consultation program,&#13;
and the environmental assessment of two railway crossing sites, a set of environmental principles for the&#13;
design and construction of such civil works are proposed for the project. These criteria would be&#13;
described in the Operational Manual in order to be taken into account by stakeholders (municipalities)&#13;
and would be supervised by the Project Implementation Unit. These criteria are summarized in Box 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-77-                                    ANNEX I&#13;
Box 1: Urban Environmental Criteria for the Desian and Construction of Crossings&#13;
Railway crossing solutions should meet the following urban and environmental criteria:&#13;
* The designs must avoid/minimize the need for residential resettlement of population, as well as&#13;
minimize or avoid the impact on green and recreational areas and buildings of historical or&#13;
architectural value.&#13;
* Access to dwellings and businesses should be guaranteed for both the construction and&#13;
operational phases. Any restriction or limitation to accessibility to properties should be properly&#13;
mitigated or compensated.&#13;
* Safe and secure pedestrian and bicycle crossings should be integrated into the design and&#13;
construction of the road/rail crossings.&#13;
* The design should harmonize with urban surroundings including landscaping and planning for&#13;
other uses for all additionally created spaces (under-bridges, cul-de-sacs, pedestrian-only streets)&#13;
in order to minimize negative impacts on environmental quality and property values.&#13;
*  Altemative solutions and final designs should be subject to public and community consultation&#13;
with special emphasis on the property owners directly affected, local NGOs and community&#13;
organizations, and business and professional organizations.&#13;
* To minimize public nuisances, construction activities should follow strict environmental&#13;
guidelines. Construction schedules and the timing of necessary interruption of public utilities&#13;
(electricity, water and telephone) should be informed to the affected community.&#13;
* All areas and infrastructure affected during construction should be restored to their original&#13;
condition, specially sidewalks, green street dividers, gardens, sidewalk trees, utilities, and side&#13;
streets impacted by traffic diversion.&#13;
* The design of road/rail grade separations should contemplate and stimulate the better integration&#13;
of both urban sides of the railway.&#13;
E. Environmental Guidelines during Construction&#13;
9.    A set of environmental guidelines for the construction of road/rail grade separations has been&#13;
defined for the project. The purpose of these guidelines is to establish specific rules for contractors for&#13;
minimizing environmental damage and public nuisances during the construction of this type of urban&#13;
infrastructure. Examples of the topics that are included in the guidelines are: (a) traffic and pedestrian&#13;
safety measures and signals; (b) careful work schedule and infrastructure planning in order to guarantee&#13;
accessibility to properties; (c) the appropriate handling of construction and equipment wastes such as&#13;
excavated earth, spoil materials and oily wastes from machinery; (d) noise and dust control measures;&#13;
(e) information for the public about work schedules and public services interruptions; (f) traffic detours;&#13;
(g) construction planning, camp location, and rules for workers to minimize public nuisances; (h)&#13;
stockpiling of materials and drainage on work sites; and (i) camp dismantling and abandonment.&#13;
F. Transport Integration&#13;
10.    The project would also include the upgrading and improvement of transfer stations, most of&#13;
which have been identified (see Annex B). They will be subject to the same screening-EA-public&#13;
consultation process as the railway crossings. Most of the sites at the existing stations are property of the&#13;
railways agency, and some of them are occupied by minor structures (stalls, one-story buildings) which&#13;
have been leased to mainly middle class retail, flower, and food vendors. These businesses bid for these&#13;
spaces on an annual or semi-annual basis. All of them pay a monthly rent to the railway agency. In&#13;
addition to the screening and consultation process, the Operational Manual would specify the necessary&#13;
studies to carry out and conditions which will have to be met in order to guarantee appropriate solutions.&#13;
The designs should: (a) integrate as much as feasible this type of stalls in the design of the future&#13;
transfer station; and (b) provide assistance to vendors to have access to other sites.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX I                                   -78-&#13;
G. Environmental Management under Project Implementation&#13;
11.   The project would provide the necessary resources and mechanisms to ensure the application&#13;
and implementation of all environmental criteria and guidelines. This assurance would be achieved&#13;
through:&#13;
(a)   technical assistance to provide advice on environmental and social aspects, and urban&#13;
environmental regulations during project execution;&#13;
(b)   strengthening of the UEP's environmental capability to screen designs and ensure&#13;
compliance with environmental requirements;&#13;
(c)   training programs in environmental management of urban infrastructure, targeting the&#13;
planning and design officials of participating municipalities;&#13;
(d)    environmental criteria, EA and community consuftation methodologies would be&#13;
specified in the Operational Manual;&#13;
(e)    bidding documents would include environmental guidelines for construction, and other&#13;
environmental requirements stemming from the EA or the public consultation; and&#13;
(f)   the Operational Manual would include specific criteria for compensating any diminished&#13;
accessibility to dwellings and businesses caused by the construction o f road/rail&#13;
crossings.&#13;
12.   In addition to the above mechanisms, the project would finance: (a) the development of a&#13;
sustainable air quality monitoring program; (b) the preparation of a transport model suitable for testing&#13;
alternative transport investments; and (c) the development of a program to improve the city's traffic and&#13;
street environment, including pedestrian facilities, traffic calming, updating of street hierarchy, sidewalk&#13;
widening and repairs, and signals and markings at intersections. These components are expected to&#13;
improve environmental management of the metropolitan area.&#13;
&#13;

BUENOS AIRES URBAN TRANSPORT PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX J: AIR POLLUTION IN BUENOS AIRES&#13;
A. Brief Description&#13;
1.    The rapid increase of vehicles, together with the deterioration of public transport, make it clear&#13;
that the capacity of the roads are insufficient for the number of vehicles in circulation. This situation&#13;
causes problems of congestion in the densely populated AMBA, air and noise pollution, and road&#13;
accidents.&#13;
2.    A recent study of the Argentine environmental problems conducted by the World Bank found air&#13;
and noise pollution in urban areas to be a priority problem and that the information about pollution levels&#13;
to be fragmented and scarce.&#13;
B. Implementation&#13;
3.    A study is being conducted whose objectives are to evaluate the need for air quality monitoring&#13;
in the federal capital, recommend and estimate the costs for an air quality monitoring network, and&#13;
recommend appropriate institutional arrangements.&#13;
4.    A brief summary of what has been accomplished up to October 1996 under the "Design of an Air&#13;
Quality and Noise Monitoring Program for the Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area" technical assistance&#13;
program is provided below.&#13;
C. Location of Monitoring Sites&#13;
5.    The preliminary design of the monitoring system calls for ten fixed sites, plus one mobile&#13;
monitoring unit and several portable samplers for particulate material. The locations of the fixed sites&#13;
have been chosen to serve the following purposes:&#13;
(a)   to measure environmental conditions at some of the locations in the city most heavily&#13;
affected by noise and air pollution from local traffic. These conditions are experienced by&#13;
most of the ciy's residents during part of the day and by some residents for much of the&#13;
day;&#13;
(b)   to measure environmental conditions representative of broad areas of the city, which are&#13;
indicative of the range of average conditions experiences by the general population;&#13;
(c)   to provide the data needed to validate future air quality modeling efforts; and&#13;
(d)   to provide a baseline for evaluation the impacts and effectiveness of future air pollution&#13;
control efforts.&#13;
S.    It should be noted that in developing this list of monitoring sites, no attempt was made to&#13;
characterize the areas of greatest impact of specific major stationary sources of air pollution, such as the&#13;
two thermoelectrical plants. Such source-specific monitoring would be desirable as well (especially for&#13;
the thermoelectrical plants). It would be most appropriate that such monitoring be provided by the&#13;
operators of the major fixed sources in question under the supervision of the city.&#13;
7.    The ten fixed sites are proposed to be located in the following areas:&#13;
Sffes Heavily Influenced by Local Traffic&#13;
(a)    microcenter (business district)-street canyons with major influences by buses and taxis;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX J                                   -80-&#13;
(b)    Centro de Transbordo Constituci6n-one of several major transfer centers between&#13;
commuter rail, buses, and the subway, located in a business/residential district near&#13;
downtown;&#13;
(c)    Avenida Rivadavia-street canyon near the center of the city, with one of the heaviest&#13;
concentrations of bus routes; and&#13;
(d)    Avenida Cabildo-street canyon in a congested area of high-rise residential apartments,&#13;
heavily affected by public transport and by private automobiles.&#13;
Sites Representative of Neighborhood Conditions&#13;
(a)    Hospital Nacional de Pediatrla-a sensitive location, located near several other hospitals&#13;
in a mixed residential/commercial zone, and potentially affected by nearby industry,&#13;
heavy industry in the adjoining Province of Buenos Aires, and a major themnoelectric&#13;
plant. An altemative location in the adjoining Barracas district (closer to the heavy&#13;
industry sources) is also under consideration;&#13;
(b)    Saenz district-mixed residential/industrial, heavily affected by truck and bus traffic and&#13;
by heavy industry upwind in the adjoining Province of Buenos Aires;&#13;
(c)    Mataderos district-mixed residential/industrial district on the westem (downwind) side of&#13;
the city, with heavy truck traffic; and&#13;
(d)    Devoto district-near the geographic center of the city, just downwind of the heaviest&#13;
population concentrations. An altemative location, coincident with the weather station&#13;
maintained by the Servicio Nacional de Meteorologla, is also under consideration.&#13;
Background Concentrations&#13;
(a)    Pdnton Recalada-floating installation in the Rio de La Plata, permanently stationed&#13;
about 5 km from the port as a base for the pilots guiding ships into port, also used for&#13;
weather measurements by the Servicio Nacional de Meteorologla.&#13;
8.    This list is subject to possible additions and subtractions, depending on the final budgetary&#13;
analysis.&#13;
9.    Other Installations. In addition to the ten monitoring sites, the network would include a&#13;
laboratory, a data collection and processing center, and telecommunications to link them together. The&#13;
data collection and processing center would be specified with a view to future expansion, in order to&#13;
incorporate additional monitoring sites for a total of around 40. These additional sites could include a&#13;
contemplated future network in the Province of Buenos Aires, as well as any sites required by future&#13;
source-specific agreements. For instance, environmental covenants associated with multilateral&#13;
financing of a new tollway may require air quality monitoring in the vicinity.&#13;
D. Institutional Arrangements&#13;
10.   Under Argentina's federal system, the Govemment of the City of Buenos Aires is responsible for&#13;
environmental planning and development of environmental policies for the federal capital. The&#13;
fundamental statute or constitution recently adopted by the city provided that "every person has the right&#13;
to enjoy a clean environment, as well as the duty to preserve and defend it for the present and future&#13;
generations," and requires that the City develop plans for protecting the environmental, including air and&#13;
water quality and land use, among many other environmental concerns. Overall responsibility for urban&#13;
planning and environment lies with the Municipal Secretarla de Ambiente Urbano y Medio Ambiente.&#13;
Within the Secretarfa, responsibility for monitoring and regulation of air quality lies with the Direccion&#13;
General de Polftica y Control Ambiental (DGPCA), which is part of the Subsecretarla de Medio Ambiente.&#13;
In addition to air quality and water quality, the DGPCA is responsible for supervision of pest control&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-81-                                  ANNEXJ&#13;
activities and hazardous materials. The DGPCA staff in 1996 consisted of approximately 100 people,&#13;
with a budget of US$300,000. Of these, seven people were working directly in the area of pollution&#13;
measurements.&#13;
11.   From 1988 to 1982, the City operated a network of 12 ambient air quality monitoring stations&#13;
using manual techniques. Due to budgetary restrictions, this network has been reduced to a single&#13;
monitoring site at present, which is operated by the DGPCA. The manual measurement techniques used&#13;
are labor intensive and the equipment is old. Most of the DGPCA's air quality measurement efforts are&#13;
devoted to measurements near industrial pollution sources, carried out for enforcement purposes in&#13;
response to citizen complaints.&#13;
12.   The newly-elected government of the City of Buenos Aires has stated plans to sharply increase&#13;
the emphasis on environmental quality in the City. In support of this effort, the budget requested for the&#13;
DGPCA has increased ten-fold, from US$300,000 to US$3 million. The city is also launching a number&#13;
of environmental initiatives, among them a system of inspection and maintenance of private vehicles,&#13;
which will also be under the supervision of the DGPCA and which is likely to pose significant technical&#13;
and political challenges.&#13;
13.   As the institution responsible for monitoring and assuring the environmental health of the City,&#13;
the Govemment of the City of Buenos Aires (GCBA) would be a logical institution to own and operate the&#13;
air quality monitoring network. It has not yet been decided whether this network would be operated by&#13;
GCBA or another agency with qualifications in this field. Whichever agency is eventually selected, an&#13;
agreement will have to be signed with that agency stating that it will accept legal ownership of the air&#13;
quality monitoring and data collection and processing equipment for the network, and that it will assure&#13;
their physical protection. Funds for operation and maintenance of the system would initially be provided&#13;
from the World Bank loan, but these would be replaced within a defined period (not to exceed three&#13;
years) by funds from the agency's budget. The final agreement would also provide that ownership of the&#13;
equipment revert back to SOPyT if the agency fails to provide the agreed operating funds. SOPyT and&#13;
the agency would jointly constitute a working group, in which other interested parties such as the&#13;
University of Buenos Aires and the Servicio Nacional de Meteorologla would also participate as advisors.&#13;
This working group would oversee the operation of the monitoring network and would collaborate to&#13;
develop plans and policies for air quality management. It is envisioned that the Province of Buenos Aires&#13;
could also accede to this working group in the future, in conjunction with the expansion of the network to&#13;
cover the entire metropolitan area.&#13;
14.   Arrangements for the day-to-day operations and maintenance of the monitoring network would&#13;
include daily checks of the equipment, daily changes of filters for particulate monitoring, weighing and&#13;
chemical analysis of the filters, and a continuous review of incoming data for quality control and quality&#13;
assurance purposes. This is estimated to require a staff of about ten people, including six technicians,&#13;
two environmental chemists, and two data processing/telecommunications specialists. Three vehicles&#13;
would also be required.&#13;
15.   Possible network operation arrangements include having the selected agency operate the&#13;
network with its own personnel, contracting with a private firm or NGO for network operations, or&#13;
contracting with another government agency. Of these, the contracting with a private firm or NGO would&#13;
be the best choice. The Argentine Govemment has a clearly-defined policy of privatization or contracting&#13;
out activities where possible. Contracting out the daily operation of the network would also facilitate the&#13;
supervisory functions of the working group, since it would be overseeing the work of a hired contractor,&#13;
rather than the work of one of its own members. Finally, such contracting would greatly simplify the&#13;
arrangements by which the World Bank loan is to supply the operating and maintenance funds for the&#13;
initial period of operation.&#13;
E. Procurement&#13;
16.   The monitoring equipment, installation, training, and supplies and spares for the initial period of&#13;
operation would be procured as a single package under a "tumkey" contract. Procurement would be by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX J                                    -82-&#13;
intemational competitive bidding, following World Bank procedures. Bid specifications and detailed siting&#13;
arrangements for the system would be developed by specialist consultants in early 1997. If it is decided&#13;
to contract out the daily operations of the system, then operation for an initial period could also be&#13;
included in the equipment contract (i.e., build-operate-transfer).&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Buenos Aires Urban Transport Project
            objectives will be to support the private-public partnership
            in improving the service quality and coverage of mass
            transit; b) support the infrastructure improvements defined
            in the concession agreement between the Government and the
            private sector; c) assist in improving the conditions of
            traffic safety and environmental quality; and d) help in
            developing an integrated urban transport system for the AMBA
            (Buenos Aires Metropolitan Area).  The project will comprise
            a package of actions and investments aimed at the following:
            a) finance rail equipment and infrastructure; b) promote the
            integration of the transport system by upgrading transfer
            stations among rail lines, building better transfer
            facilities between rail and road-based transport, and
            generally improving road access to rail stations; c) improve
            traffic safety and environmental conditions through the
            construction of grade separations at high-volume crossing,
            the enhancement of controls at road/rail grade crossings,
            the development of a complementary program of road safety
            actions and the introduction of systematic air pollution
            monitoring; and d) strengthen the institutional framework.
