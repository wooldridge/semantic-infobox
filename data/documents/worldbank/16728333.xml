Malawi loses MWK8.8 billion annually&#13;
due to poor sanitation&#13;
Poor sanitation costs Malawi 8.8 billion Malawi Kwacha each year,                                     Malawi sanitation coverage&#13;
&#13;

   â&#128;¢ 5.2 million Malawians use unsanitary or shared latrines&#13;
   â&#128;¢ 1.4 million have no latrine at all and defecate in the open.&#13;
   â&#128;¢ The poorest quintile is 176 times more likely to practice open defection than the richest.&#13;
&#13;
Open defecation costs Malawi US$14 million â&#128;&#147; yet eliminating the practice would require less&#13;
                                                                                                     Source: (JMP, 2010)&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
                                                    US$2.7 million lost each year in Access Time:&#13;
                                                    Each person practicing open defecation spends almost 2.5 days a year ï¬&#129;nding&#13;
                                                    a private location to defecate leading to large economic losses. This cost falls&#13;
                                                    disproportionately on women as caregivers who may spend additional time&#13;
                                                    accompanying young children or sick or elderly relatives. This cost is likely to be&#13;
                                                    an underestimation as those without toilets, particularly women, will be obliged&#13;
                                                    to ï¬&#129;nd a private location for urination as well.a&#13;
&#13;
                                                    US$43 million lost each year due to Premature Death:&#13;
                                                    Approximately 8,800 Malawians, including 4,500 children under 5, die each&#13;
                                                    year from diarrhea â&#128;&#147; nearly 90% of which is directly attributed to poor water,&#13;
                                                    sanitation and hygiene (WASH).b In addition poor sanitation is a contributing&#13;
                                                    factor â&#128;&#147; through its impact on malnutrition rates â&#128;&#147; to other leading causes of&#13;
                                                    child mortality including malaria, ALRI and measles.&#13;
&#13;
                                                    US$0.3 million lost each year due to Productivity Losses whilst sick&#13;
                                                    or accessing healthcare:&#13;
                                                    This includes time absent from work or school due to diarrheal disease, seeking&#13;
                                                    treatment from a health clinic or hospital, and time spent caring for under-5â&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                                                    suffering from diarrhea or other sanitation-attributable diseases.&#13;
&#13;
                                                    US$12 million spent each year on Health Care:&#13;
                                                    Diarrheal diseases directly, and indirectly via malnutrition (and its consequences&#13;
                                                    for other diseases such as respiratory infections and malaria) are all leading&#13;
                                                    causes of morbidity. Costs associated with health seeking behaviour include&#13;
*1US$ = MWK 153.283 (2010 average)                  consultation, medication, transport and in some cases hospitalisation â&#128;&#147; which&#13;
GDP Source: World Bank                              place a heavy burden on households and government spending.&#13;
                                                                1&#13;
&amp;#12;EQUITY&#13;
The economic burden of poor sanitation falls&#13;
most heavily on the poorest&#13;
The costs of poor sanitation are inequitably           Graph: Cost per capita of unimproved sanitation as % of&#13;
distributed with the highest economic burden                  income by wealth quintile&#13;
falling disproportionately on the poorest. The&#13;
average cost associated with poor sanitation,&#13;
constitutes a much greater proportion of a&#13;
poor personâ&#128;&#153;s income than that of a wealthier&#13;
person.&#13;
&#13;
Access to sanitation alone demonstrates&#13;
inequities; the poorest 20% of the population are&#13;
176 times more likely to practice open defecation&#13;
than the wealthiest 20% of the population.&#13;
&#13;
For the poorest therefore, poverty is a double-&#13;
edged sword â&#128;&#147; not only are they more likely&#13;
to have poor sanitation but they have to pay&#13;
proportionately more for the negative effects it&#13;
has.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Open defecation costs more than ï¬&#129;xed-point&#13;
sanitation&#13;
In costs quantiï¬&#129;ed by the study, open defecation             Graph: Cost per capita of different types of unimproved&#13;
costs more per person than any other type of                        sanitation&#13;
unimproved sanitation; the additional costs&#13;
are mainly due to the time taken to ï¬&#129;nd a safe,&#13;
private location for defecation.&#13;
&#13;
Costs associated with shared sanitation are likely&#13;
to be higher than shown if time taken to reach&#13;
and queue at a public latrine as well as user-fees&#13;
were added. As it is not possible to estimate the&#13;
proportion of public latrine users in the shared&#13;
latrine category these costs are not included.&#13;
&#13;
Health costs cannot easily be assigned across&#13;
latrine categories.c Sanitation or lack thereof is a&#13;
public health issue â&#128;&#147; people are affected by their&#13;
neighbours and communities sanitation status&#13;
as well as their own, and the costs of open&#13;
defecation are felt throughout the community.d&#13;
&#13;
Open defecation also has considerable social&#13;
costs. Loss of dignity and privacy or risk of&#13;
physical attack and sexual violence may not be&#13;
easily valued in monetary units, but these issues&#13;
are the reality when sanitation facilities are not&#13;
available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                              2&#13;
&amp;#12;ADDITIONAL COSTS&#13;
The ï¬&#129;gure of US$57 million is likely to underestimate the true cost of the current&#13;
sanitation situation in Malawi. The following costs are likely to be signiï¬&#129;cant, but are&#13;
more difï¬&#129;cult and expensive to estimate, and therefore have not been precisely valued:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    Epidemic outbreak costs:&#13;
                    Fecal contamination of the environment is the root cause of an annual average of 2,500 cases of&#13;
                    cholera affecting Malawi.1 The cost of the necessary WASH response is estimated to be US$1.6&#13;
                    million each year.&#13;
&#13;
                    However the economic implications of a cholera outbreak go beyond the immediate health&#13;
                    system response â&#128;&#147; there are also costs related to productivity loss and premature death, diverting&#13;
                    expenditures from other essential items and losses in trade and tourism revenue.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    Funeral costs:&#13;
                    Calculations for the cost of premature death do not take into account funeral costs, which are&#13;
                    borne directly by households and can be signiï¬&#129;cant across Africa. One study in South Africa&#13;
                    found that on average, households spend the equivalent of a yearâ&#128;&#153;s total expenditure on food and&#13;
                    groceries on funerals (measured at median household expenditure). In Malawi, annual sanitation-&#13;
                    related funeral costs (discounted against future funeral costs) are estimated at US$0.4 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    Water Pollution:&#13;
                    The adverse impact of unsafe excreta disposal on water resources is not included in the cost&#13;
                    estimation as ï¬&#129;gures are not available for Africa. Where this affects drinking water supply, water&#13;
                    supply and treatment costs for drinking and other domestic uses will add to the costs associated&#13;
                    with poor sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    Cognitive development:&#13;
                    The model does not attempt to capture the long-term economic losses related to the adverse&#13;
                    effects of poor sanitation on cognitive development. Early childhood diarrhea contributes to under&#13;
                    nutrition, stunting and wasting which are associated with malnutrition and in turn with reduced&#13;
                    long-term cognitive development.e Infection with soil-transmitted helminths is also an important&#13;
                    cause of impairment in intellectual and cognitive development.2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    Tourism:&#13;
                    Tourism can be a signiï¬&#129;cant source of income, employment and foreign currency. There are&#13;
                    multiple factors that contribute to travel and tourism competitiveness. The WEF3 Travel and&#13;
                    Tourism competitiveness report ranks countries according to 75 indicators, one of which is&#13;
                    sanitation status.&#13;
&#13;
                    Based on the current contribution of travel and tourism to GDP addressing sanitation in Malawi&#13;
                    could lead to an increase in travel and tourism of an estimated US$0.7 million annually.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    Re-use:&#13;
                    Although not included in this model, recycling of excreta is an option that could bring potential&#13;
                    economic beneï¬&#129;t. The value of excreta re-use is likely to increase in the future as world phosphate&#13;
                    reserves continue to decline.&#13;

&amp;#12;TURNING FINANCE INTO SANITATION SERVICES&#13;
The 2nd AMCOW Country Status Overview (CSO2f) scorecard for Malawi (which assesses the transformation of inputs (ï¬&#129;nance)&#13;

delivery, particularly in the sustaining pillar of rural sanitation.&#13;

&amp;#12;     Estimating the economic impacts of poor sanitation&#13;
     Traditionally, sanitation has not received the priority it deserves. It has not been widely&#13;
     recognized how good sanitation policies and practices can underpin socio-economic&#13;
     development and environmental protection. This study provides an estimation of economic&#13;
     impacts on populations without access to improved sanitation in order to provide information&#13;
     on the losses to society of the current sanitation situation. While not all these economic&#13;
     impacts can be immediately recovered from improved sanitation practices, it provides&#13;
     a perspective on the economic gains that are available to countries through a range of&#13;
     policies to mitigate these impacts over the longer term. Underlying data sets to estimate&#13;
     economic impacts are weak; the study therefore uses objectively veriï¬&#129;ed data sources and&#13;
     conservative numbers to estimate economic impacts. Several impacts have been excluded&#13;
     due to lack of data (see page 3). Therefore the total costs of poor sanitation in this report&#13;
     are likely to be a signiï¬&#129;cant underestimate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Study Methods&#13;
Data used for these estimates was in large part derived from                            GNP per capita to conservatively estimate the average economic&#13;
Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS), Multiple Indicator Cluster                        contribution of a member of society.&#13;
Surveys (MICS) and the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply&#13;
and Sanitation (JMP).                                                                   Time costs for accessing site of open defecation: extra travel&#13;
                                                                                        time is based on the expert opinion of over 25 sector specialists.&#13;
Health care costs: included outpatient and inpatient costs and patient                  Time lost is valued at 30% of the GNP per capita for adults, and for&#13;
travel costs, estimated using disease rates and treatment seeking                       children over 5 years of age at 15% of the GNP per capita.&#13;

Health-related productivity costs: average length of time spent                         with-insurance spending on funerals was 37% more than without-&#13;
incapacitated was 2 days (diarrhea), 5 days (respiratory infection) and 4               insurance spending. As all people die eventually, the future funeral&#13;

diversion of carers from other activities (2 hours per day). Time value is the          the costs of holding a funeral now.&#13;
same as access time costs (see below).&#13;
                                                                                        Cholera WASH cost estimates are based on a combination of&#13;
Mortality costs: number of deaths from WHO statistics - 88% of                          preparedness and response budgets.6 Costs included are limited&#13;
diarrheal deaths attributed to fecal-oral route. Indirect deaths via increased          to coordination, community WASH response and WASH in cholera&#13;
malnutrition rates (respiratory infections, measles and malaria) were                   treatment centers. Calculations use an attack rate of 2% and disease&#13;

            Poor sanitation costs Malawi 8.8 billion
            Malawi Kwacha each year; equivalent to US$57 million,
            according to a desk study carried out by The Water and
            Sanitation Program (WSP). This sum is the equivalent of
            US$3.8 per person in Malawi per year or 1.1 percent of the
            national Gross Domestic Product (GDP). This study provides
            an estimation of economic impacts on populations without
            access to improved sanitation in order to provide
            information on the losses to society of the current
            sanitation situation. While not all these economic impacts
            can be immediately recovered from improved sanitation
            practices, it provides a perspective on the economic gains
            that are available to countries through a range of policies
            to mitigate these impacts over the longer term. Underlying
            data sets to estimate economic impacts are weak; the study
            therefore uses objectively verified data sources and
            conservative numbers to estimate economic impacts. Several
            impacts have been excluded due to lack of data. Therefore
            the total costs of poor sanitation in this report are likely
            to be a significant under estimate.
