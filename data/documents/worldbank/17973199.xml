&#13;
Bank in the first place and about what you are now doing?                  was in the Woods' period.    It was quite an important piece of work&#13;
&#13;
GULHAXI:    Thank you. I joined the Bank in the summer of 1955 when 1      (even if I say so), because, for the first time that I know of 1 it&#13;
&#13;
worked as a research assistant to Edgar Hoover who was then writing a      related the debt issue to the whole p~~cess of economic development.&#13;

book on the population problems of India and Pakistan.     I joined the             Avramovic was one of several acting heads of the economics&#13;
&#13;
permanent staff in 1956 and have been with the Bank ever since.     I am   staff.    There was a period after the departure of Mr. Rist and before&#13;
&#13;
now the chief economist for Eastern and Southern Africa, a region          the arrival of Andy Kamarck and Irving Friedman when the economic&#13;

&#13;
in these countries at the macro, sector, and project levels.               Wilde and Drag Avramovic, acted in that capacity without actually&#13;
&#13;
      When I joined the Bank, the economic staff was headed by Leonard     being appointed head of the department.&#13;
&#13;
Rist. I worked as a research assistant, or a junior economist, with             The economists in the Bank in the Eugene Black period were not&#13;
&#13;
Drag Avramovic who was then writing a major work on external debt          very influential.    The Economic Staff was really a backwater. Most of&#13;
&#13;
issues.    I worked with him on this subject quite a long time.   Over a   the policy questions for the Bank were in fact dealt with and worked&#13;
&#13;
period of years, this ended up in the production of three books on the     on by a department headed by Dick Demuth..   I had the impression at&#13;
&#13;
external debt question.                                                    that time that the economists were rarely involved in policy work; the&#13;
     The external debt issues at that time were really of relevance        lawyers were really much more influential.    Then there was a very&#13;

&#13;
had borrowed on commercial terms.    You will recall that, in the late     The economics work in the Bank got quite a bit more prominent in terms&#13;
&#13;
'50s, there were a number of rescheduling&amp; of the debts of Latin           of ita impact on policy.&#13;
&#13;
American countries.     It was in that context that Avramovic was asked         My disadvantage in talking about this is that, in 1966, I left&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                           3                                                                           4&#13;

&#13;
HiAistry as Director of the Department of Economic Affairs, so I          OLIVER:    What vas the proposa 17&#13;
&#13;
didn't quite see the blossaning of this initiative which was clearly      GULHATI:    Well. the idea was that e:z:terna 1 financial resources should&#13;

&#13;
staff of the Pearson Commission, and again I was absent for a whole       the event of an export short-fall.       That begs the question of what the&#13;
&#13;
year while doing work on the report of the Pearson Commission.            nature of the plan was:      What was the policy framework on which it was&#13;
&#13;
     I did work with Irving Friedman on the study of supplementary        built?     Bow realiatic were the financial calculations which provided&#13;
&#13;
financial measures which started sometime in 1964, I guess, and went      the framework for the plan? and How was the plan going to be financed&#13;
&#13;
on for more than a year.   This proposal had been tabled by the UK and    in the first place?       How much external assistance was visualised?     We&#13;
&#13;
Sweden at the 1964 UNCTAD conference in Geneva.   The Bank was asked to   were asked to try to think about a proposal which would deal with what&#13;
&#13;
examine the capability of establishing a facility to deal with the        would happen in the event of an export short-fall mid stream in the&#13;
&#13;
adverse impact of export short-falls on economic development.     That    implementation of a plan.       We were not asked to look at the questions&#13;
&#13;
was a point of departure for an exercise which involved a group of 6      What are the normal flows of development assistance?       What triggers&#13;
&#13;
or 7 people who met several times a week in Irving Friedman's office      normal flows of assistance?      How should allocation of external&#13;
&#13;
to see how we could respond to this particular request.                   assistance be allocated among countries?       What were the governing&#13;
&#13;
    I can recall that these discussions would gather momentum, and we     forces that covered the allocation of financial assistance fran&#13;
&#13;
would, from time to time, be drawn into subjects which were outside       abroad? and so on. We felt that we were on to the tail of the dog&#13;
&#13;
the scope of the UK-Swedish proposal insofar as we were involved in       rather than the dog itself.&#13;
&#13;
discussions of development assistance in general as distinct from the     OLIVER:    I take it you talked about the dog a bit also.&#13;
&#13;
kind of financial assistance which might be available in the event of     GULBAXI:    I think so.     I aa not sure of my facta, but my impreasio1&#13;
&#13;
an export short-fall.   We found it difficult to separate these two       that we visualized that before a country was judged to be eligiblr&#13;
&#13;
things. We were aware that, in trying to deal with the subject that we    such special financing, there would have to be a discussion by thâ&#128;¢&#13;

&#13;
addressing a small part of a much larger   probl~   This was, in fact,    of insured.    We visualized that there would have to be this disctâ&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
a difficulty which persisted throughout our discussions.       It may     about the development plan, ita quality and ita reasonableness; 1&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             5                                                                             6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the framework of the plan would be looked at; projections would have          from Soviet experience.     It spread from there.    In America I think it&#13;
&#13;
to be reasonable; and the policy framework Would have to be                   was very different in the sense that development planning did not have&#13;
&#13;
satisfactory.   Only if all these conditions were met would the country       a great deal of operational meaning.       It was very late in the day when&#13;
&#13;
be eligible to receive help in the event of an export short-fall.             Latin American countries started to have something that was similar.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    I realize, of course, that there is no supplementary finance       OLIVER:    In the case of the African countries, they were only becoming&#13;
&#13;
plan in existence at the present time, but I want to ask the question:        independent in the '60s.&#13;
&#13;
Does the Bank today come fairly close to doing the same kind of               GULHAXI:     I think you are probably right about that.   Of course Arthur&#13;
&#13;
programming with its sector adjustment lending?                               Lewis was beginning to do his thing in Ghana in the mid '50s.        I have&#13;
GULRATI:   Well, the Bank has been in the business of reviewing five-         never worked in Nigeria, but my impression is that Nigerians made some&#13;
&#13;
year plana, but I think the seriousness with which such evaluations           initial efforts in the planning direction in the early '60s or&#13;
&#13;
are done varies a great deal.      rm    sure that if there is something      thereabouts.     At any rate, what I think we are now saying to our&#13;
&#13;
operational to emerge out of these evaluations, like, for example,            countries is that five-year plans even longer perspective plans are&#13;
&#13;
eligibility for a particular scheme or recommendations to a consortia         somewhat remote from operational policy making and annual budgets.&#13;
&#13;
of aid donors, then the quality and the depth of the evaluations would        Something like a     three-year plan is difficult enough because things&#13;
&#13;
have to be quite different.      What bas happened, of course, in the part    are changing so rapidly and there is so much uncertainty.&#13;
&#13;
of the Bank that I am now working in -- Africa,       five-year plans are a   OLIVER:    Well, if that is true, then is it not probable the&#13;
&#13;
thing of the past.     Many of the countries in the region are so much        supplementary finance scheme was unrealistic?&#13;
&#13;
affected by financial difficulties that the whole idea of planning for        GULRAII:     Of course, in the 1960s, the world looked quite a bit&#13;
&#13;
five or six   ~ears   is a remote one.   More countries are trying to look    different.      World trade was growing.   What bas happened since then is&#13;
at the next three years, so we have a more truncate.d time horizon for        the first oil price increase and then the second oil price increase.&#13;
planning than used to be the case in the '60s.       In fact, the whole       Now we have an environment in which development planning is quite&#13;
&#13;
idea of developaent planning bas fallen into disfavor in the sense            difficult.     If the supplementary financial measure had been adopted,&#13;
that it was practiced in the '60s and '70s.                                   it could have run into rough weather in the '70s.       My feeling is&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    You mention the '60s.                                              that, although we had, as I have said earlier, our band on the tail of&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                            7                                                                        8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
evolved.     It would have had an inner dynamic and would have led to a    fall is calculated by comparing actual exports with a three year&#13;
&#13;
questioning of the framework for normal foreign assistance and for         coverage which is a result of a formula, which puts a lot of weight on&#13;
&#13;
planning as a whole rather than just in terms of the impact of export      actual exports in the year of the short-fall as well as a projection&#13;
&#13;
short-falls.     Whether the world was prepared for that is another        year, and a preceeding year. That is a very different kind of thing&#13;
&#13;
issue.     In fact not even today is it ready for that -- except under     from trying to finance, abort-falls which arise as the difference&#13;
&#13;
very dire circumstances such as prevail in Africa today.                   between plan projections for say five-years, and the actual exports of&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Well. some people today see debts in life and death terms of   a bad year.   We could never convince the Fund of the usefulness of our&#13;
&#13;
supplementary finance.                                                     supplementary financial measures.   On the other hand, they could never&#13;
&#13;
GULHATI:    That ia an interesting analogy.   There was a proposal         convince us that the existing IKF facility met the kind of objectives&#13;
&#13;
recently for the International Monetary Fund to have a facility which      that sponsors of this proposal in UNCTAD bad.   There was no meeting of&#13;
&#13;
debtor countries could draw on in the event that variable interest         minds in the Fund and the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
rates on external debts turned out to be higher than they had been         OLIVER: What eventually happened?&#13;
&#13;
anticipated, or that there should be a cap on these interest rates, so     GULBAri:   My recollection is that when we bad finished the report, it&#13;
&#13;
that countries could in fact insure themselves against interest rates      received some quite critical comaenta from within the Bank staff.       It&#13;
&#13;
rising above a particular level.                                           was pointed out, quite rightly, that this would mean a major expansion&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     This is a proposal that is separate from the Compensatory      of the Bank's economic work and would also get us into a very&#13;
&#13;
Finance Scheme?                                                            different kind of lending.   If you were going to adopt this kind of&#13;
&#13;
GULHATI:     The Compensatory Financing Facility only deals with export    approach to supplementary finance, this would rub off on the nonaal&#13;
&#13;
short-falls and with the need for cereal imports in the event of a         flow of finance from IDA, and nobody was prepared to abandon the way&#13;
&#13;
domestic production crisis.    I recall there were a n1llllber of          in which project aid was being administered by IDA.    So, as I said,&#13;
&#13;
discussions with the IKF because obviously the two proposals bad to        the proposal, when it came out, had a rough time within the Bank as&#13;
&#13;
have some kind of an interface.     It was recognized that what we were    well as in the Fund.   Nevertheless, I remember that, before I went to&#13;
&#13;
trying to construct in this proposal was really of a different order       India, Mr. Woods had signed off on this proposal.     It was in fact&#13;
&#13;
of magnitude and was on a different plane, a different logical plane,      formally submitted to UNCIAD, and vas subsequently published.     Then,&#13;
&#13;
because in the Compensatory Financing Scheme of the Fund, the abort-       as I watched it from New Delhi, I saw that it was being endlessly&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                9.                                                                              10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
debated in various fora of the UNCTAD.          Various expert groups were          favorite of the French.      I guess we came to the conclusi,on that the&#13;
&#13;
appointed to look at this aspect and that aspect.          I don't know the         commodity approach could be     compl~entaryi   there is no inherent&#13;
&#13;
details of this too much, but I know that a number of my friends were               inconsistency.&#13;
&#13;
looking at this. Ooe of these people, by the way -- a person who is                           Even if you bad a lot more commodity schemes, however, you&#13;
&#13;
now a very senior official in the Finance Ministry in India -- used to              would still require a financial scheme to deal with the impact of&#13;
&#13;
come to India from Washington and tell me about all the discussions                 price fluctuations of commodities not governed by the commodities&#13;
&#13;
which were going on in international fora in 1967 discussing the                    agreements.      The commodity schemes only covered the impact of price&#13;
&#13;
supplementary financial measures. This obviously didn't proceed very                fluctuations, moreover, whereas this scheme would also have covered&#13;
&#13;
far; after awhile, I think everyone got tired of discussing it, and it              the impact of quantity fluctuations which were the result of&#13;
&#13;
was put on the shelf.                                                               international recessions and domestic harvest failures.       I think that&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Was the availability of additional IDAaoney an issue?                     the proposal itself lays out the rationale regardless of what happens&#13;
&#13;
GULB~l:    That was also an issue in discussions within the Bank.            They   to commodity scbemesi it argued that this would be a useful piece of&#13;
&#13;
talked about whether rich country governments would contribute                      international machinery notwithstanding existing commodity schemes as&#13;
&#13;
additional monies or would the new scheme encroach on budgets that                  well as new ones.&#13;
&#13;
rich country governments had in mind for the next normal replenishment              OLIVER:    Do you happen to remember what Drag Avramovic thought about&#13;
&#13;
of IDA.   Of course, aany in the Bank were quite set against providing              the Supplementary Finance Scheme in contrast to the commodity&#13;
&#13;
competition to IDA.     That   xu   an issue.                                       stabilization proposals he worked on?&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Was it suggested at the time that the world needed some sort              GULBAXI:    I think you should explore that question with Drag. My&#13;
&#13;
of a commodity stabilization scheme?                                                impression that he was not so keen on supplementary financial&#13;
&#13;
GULB~I:   We did discuss this point in the report and in the proposal               measures, but I m.ay be wrong.&#13;
&#13;
that we made.   There are different ways of dealing with price                      OLIVER:    Do you know anything about the other economics work that was&#13;
&#13;
fluctuations. We compared and contrasted and discussed the costs and                going on in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
benefits of the financial approach to the new scheme, the approach                  GULRA7I:    Yes, I can say something about one other thing which I vas&#13;
&#13;
embodied in the Compensatory Financing Facility in the Monetary Fund,               involved with and which bad some ramifications.      That was the concern&#13;
&#13;
as against the commodity approach, which was always very much a                     at that    t~e   about what the total capital requireaents of developing&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                             11                                                                        12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
countries should be.      This was something which got discussed in many    Bank, but it certainly is more familiar territory now than it used to&#13;
&#13;
different ways.     I remember 1 was asked by Irving Friedman to            be.     Cbenery tried during his period in the Bank to develop the model&#13;
&#13;
participate in an expert group which was established by the                 and to make it operational.&#13;
&#13;
Development Assistance Committee in Paris to examine the                    OLIVER:     Hasn't there always been a bit of a schism in the Bank&#13;
&#13;
methodological approach to estimating external capital requirements.        between operations and research?&#13;
&#13;
I remember going to many of these meetings.     Finally we produced a       GULBATI:     The cultural milieu of the operators is quite a bit&#13;
&#13;
report.                                                                     different from that of the researchers in the BanL      In my career in&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER.:    Methodological issues were discussed in Paris?                  the Bank, I have had many jobs in operations, and Chenery appointed me&#13;
&#13;
GULBA:rl:    Yes.   I think that the kind of methodology that the experts   head of the Development Economics Department.      I stayed there for&#13;
&#13;
were talking about was much more rigorous and much less vulnerable to       four years.    I have seen both sides of the gulf, and I can say that&#13;
&#13;
subjective assessments.      The ezpert group vas heavily influenced by     this alienation has existed ever since I have been in the Bank.        It&#13;
&#13;
the work Tinbergen, Hollis Cbenery and Alan Strout bad done.       All of   takes very special attributes to communicate across this frontier.&#13;
&#13;
them were aembera of the Expert Group.                                      The Bank has tried over the years a nu.ber of institutional ways of&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Do you think these models should have had more influence on     lessening this gap, this gulf, and I guess that probably, although I&#13;
&#13;
the Bank?                                                                   am. not a very good source for a judgement on this, my ~pression is&#13;
&#13;
GULUA7I:     I would say the Cheoery-Strout model has had an impact on      that the gulf has diminished.     There is in fact more understanding.&#13;
&#13;
the Bank in terms of the way we think about our country programming         There is certainly more understanding on the part of the researchers.&#13;
&#13;
papers now.     Are you familiar with country programming papers?           They have to find ways of communicating better what they are doing          to&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     In general.                                                     invu1Ve ope.at.ona. peop e more in the process of research      ~d   finally&#13;
&#13;
GULHAXI:     One of the things that country programming papers do is to     to commun1cate more intelligently the findings that they come out with&#13;
&#13;
estimate external capital requirements.      There is a standard model            to relate them to the operational side. The new economists who have&#13;
&#13;
which most country economists use.      It is called the Reduced Minimal    joined us in the last five to ten years have been much more skillful&#13;
&#13;
Standard Model.      If one examines the genesis of that model, one can     in the use of policy tools, and have more understanding of the&#13;
&#13;
relate it to the methodological approach which was described in the         framework within which research is conducted.     They have more&#13;
&#13;
report of the expert group.      Models remain very controversial in the    tolerance for, and are more interested in, operations.     Some&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                           13                                                                             14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
operators are very enthusiastic about the research, but I think I             GULHATI:     I don't think much happened as far as I am aware.    Maybe I&#13;
&#13;
would have to say that there still persists a substantial distance            am betraying my ignorance, but I doOt think there was very much&#13;
&#13;
between the two sides.                                                        population work of an innovative nature apart from Coale and Hoover in&#13;
&#13;
       In the 60s, things were much less systematic.   It was a very much     the 1950s.     Subsequently, in the '70s, there was a lot of work on the&#13;
&#13;
more   hit-o~iaa   kind of exercise.   I gave you the instance of the         whole issue of determinants of fertility, inside and outside the BanL&#13;
&#13;
work on external debt which was probably done because Avramovic was           OLIVER:     I suppose one of the major functions of the Economics&#13;
&#13;
present, and Avramovic bad a great interest in this. There was this           Department is to stay abreast of the literature.&#13;
&#13;
request from the OECD to do quite a substantial study, but this need          GULBA7I:     I think that is now becoming more systematized.&#13;
&#13;
not have happened.   There was no systematic research planning                OLIVER:     We have just five minutes left, rm sorry to say.     What would&#13;
&#13;
capacity, or financing; and very little evaluation of research or             you like to talk about?&#13;
&#13;
organization to disseminate the research.     This improved after the         GULBAri:     When I went to India in 1966, the relationship between the&#13;
&#13;
establishment of the research ca-mittee, which, I think, took place           Bank and India had been very much strained by the emotions embodied in&#13;
&#13;
right after Hollis Chenery came.                                              the Bell Mission Report and its aftermath involving also the question&#13;
&#13;
       There has taken place an evolution in the research function; a         of the external assistance which was not delivered -- at least that&#13;
&#13;
cycle bas been developed.      One could say this is bureaucratized           was the opinion of the Indiana.&#13;
&#13;
research and is lesa creative.      That ia always the cost one pays.    I        I remember when I came to India to work in the Ministry of&#13;
&#13;
think some of the work that was done in '50s and '60s was very                Finance, people had trouble accepting me.     I vas sort of linked with&#13;
&#13;
innovative. but it was highly related to individuals.      The work on        the Bank.     I don't know if this is any use to you.   It was a low point&#13;
&#13;
commodities was attractive. A lot of work was done on projects, on the        in the history of Bank-India relationships.&#13;
&#13;
methodology for project appraisal.      A lot of it was done outside the      OLIVER:     Was it that the Bell Mission recommendations were    wrong, or&#13;
&#13;
Bank, but some of it was done inside by people like     Be~n    Van Der TaL   was it more a public relation problem?&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    VanDer Tak was in the Economics Staff. but parallel work was       GULHATI:     I think it was a major turnaround in the Bank:s posture.&#13;
&#13;
being done, I think, at the same time in the Projects Department.             You see up until that time, the Bank had been very much an advocate of&#13;
&#13;
GULHATI:    I wasn't aware of it.                                             India's position.    The Bank had established a consortium in 1959 to&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    I will follow up.    What about policy work on population?         help India mobilize external assistance. and there was very little by&#13;
&amp;#12;'                                                                15              ;'&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢&#13;
    way of a critique of India.. s policies-- certainly very little&#13;
&#13;
    conditionality      and or any hint of it.   The Bell report was the first&#13;
&#13;
    move in a c0111pletely new endeavor which was to look very hard and&#13;
&#13;
    critically at India's economic policies.      This generated a great deal&#13;
&#13;
    of antagonism from Indian officialdom.&#13;
&#13;
        The posture of the Bank changed from being an advocate to becoming&#13;
&#13;
    a provider of conditional resources, and, of course, the whole&#13;
&#13;
    discussion on exchange rates ran into aome bad luck because of the&#13;
&#13;
    timing.     This happened to take place at the same tiae that Indian&#13;
&#13;
    agriculture had a drought, and there was a aajor short-fall in&#13;
&#13;
    supplies.     The trauma rubbed off on the policy move to change the&#13;
&#13;
    exchange rate.      Indian journa 1 ists were all very ezercieed about the&#13;
&#13;
    currency devaluation:      "Look at what it haâ&#128;¢ produced."&#13;
&#13;
    OLIVER:     I think Mr. Woods as an individual was not very popular in&#13;
&#13;
    India at that t:Uae.&#13;
&#13;
    GULRATI:     rm   sure there was something of that, but I would say that&#13;
&#13;
    the issues the Bell Mission addressed were very critical issues for&#13;
&#13;
    Indian economic policy.      Some of their recommendations were right, but&#13;
&#13;
    there was a lot of static.&#13;
&#13;
    OLIVER:     Well, I think that ia a good conclusion on which to end our&#13;
&#13;
    conversation.      Thank you ever so much for your courtesy and t:Uae.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In November 1985, Ravi Gulhati was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert W. Oliver. During his tenure at
