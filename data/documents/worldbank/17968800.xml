&#13;
&#13;
The following is a transcript of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the&#13;
World Bank's fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh&#13;
Kapur, The World Bank: Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings&#13;
Institution Press, I 997. It is not a formal oral history, and it is not a systematic&#13;
overview of the work of the person interviewed. At times the authors discussed the&#13;
planned publication itself and the sources that should be consulted; at other times they&#13;
talked about persons and publications extraneous to the Bank. Some interview tapes&#13;
and transcripts begin and end abruptly. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group&#13;
Archives believes that this transcript may be of interest to researchers and makes it&#13;
available for public use.&#13;

[Begin Tape 1, Side Al&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: I came to the Bank in '79, and I was really basically in one or another&#13;
ofthe social sectors.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You have a daughter, don't you?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Yes, I actually have three children now, but you remember the oldest,&#13;
who's now in college.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I remember you putting her on the hood of a car, just a little baby, when&#13;
you were telling me you were going to Yale.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Oh, so that was back in '73 or '74.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Something like that.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Before I left, right But then you may also remember we still have this&#13;
cat that I associate with you for some reason.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Really?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: I think somebody that you were living with, her cat had kittens.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is that right?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Absolutely, and we went to Arlington and ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is it a furry thing?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Yeah. A little black cat, baby cat, though this cat is--to demonstrate&#13;
the passage of time--this cat has arthritis now. We have to give it a pill every day.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, I would say that I was ..&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You came back in '79?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: I came back in '79, in Timothy King's division. I worked on population&#13;
and education. Then ..&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Because you had been working in the Bank before ..&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: As a consultant, on and off, not as a regular staffer.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But also in development economics, also with King?&#13;

                               September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right, right, exactly.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: So you came back to where you had been.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Well, I hadn't really been there, you know. I'd done some things for&#13;
him, but I had been working elsewhere. So then I switched to Country Policy&#13;
Department, which is, you know, some remnant of which is still in this department,&#13;
and I worked on public finance issues but primarily in the social sectors.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Oh. Who was in charge of that?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: That was Lyn Squire's division.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And it was still Development Economics?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: No, that was in '82 when they created the Country Policy Department&#13;
when Anne Kreuger came, and, you know, there was the sort of upheaval of some&#13;
sort. There was Country Policy Department and then the Development Research&#13;
Department. It's all basically the same, though, you know.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, I went to the Country Policy Department, and Lyn Squire had this division&#13;
that was public finance or public economics or something like that. I rei:llly continued&#13;
what I'd been working on in Timothy's division in a sense, which was sort of pricing&#13;
policy for social programs. Then I did the WDR [World Development Report] on&#13;
population, and then I became a division chief.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That was the '82?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: That was the '84 WDR.&#13;
&#13;
Then I became the division chief in what was then the Population, Health, and&#13;
Nutrition Department in the research and policy part. So really until '87 you could&#13;
say, broadly speaking, that I was doing, in the research and policy complex of the&#13;
Bank in one or another of the units, working on education, health, population. Then&#13;
in '87 I went to operations, but it was the social sectors again. So only when I moved&#13;
to the environment division ..&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That was Brazil?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: That was Brazil. .. did I really leave, you know, what in the Bank is&#13;
broadly called "social sectors."&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: You left then?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: And I still haven't really left. I'd say I still sort of, you know, concern&#13;
myself, when I feel like it, with these matters, although an attraction of going to&#13;
environment and certainly this job is to get, you know--I'm a dilettante. So now I can&#13;
do other things, too. [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Like historians.&#13;
&#13;
                               Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                         September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                      4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: So you were around-you weren't in the division but you were sort of&#13;
around when the Bank was first beginning to think about health lending.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Absolutely. Right. Exactly. I remember when John Evans came. He&#13;
came in about '82, right when we'd started doing-you know, health was kind of set&#13;
up as a legitimate separate area for lending in about '82, I think.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In '79 was the policy.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Oh, was it that early?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In '73 was the first health policy paper where they decided not lend&#13;
separately for health except as components of other projects.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: And then in '79 they said okay.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Okay for health per se.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: I guess-I mean, my sense is that not a whole lot happened until they&#13;
established the Population, Health and Nutrition Department, which I guess was ..&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: '79.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Oh, was it '79?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yes. [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: And that's when John Evans came?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That's what I think. That's a little bit--but maybe you're right. I'm less sure&#13;
about when he took over, but I'm reasonably sure PHN was established in '79.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Well, anyway, my sort of--what I recall is around '82 it heated up.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Was there particular reason why in '82 it heated up?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: I thought it was bureaucratic. I thought that that's when they brought&#13;
John Evans in and created this department and sort of said that it was legitimate to&#13;
consider health as a separate sector for lending. So, you know, if it was '79, I'm&#13;
surprised but whatever. So my timing might be a little bit off. But there's no question&#13;
in my mind that when John Evans came that that made a difference because he was a&#13;
doctor, and he, you know, he basically decided that in this PHN Department they&#13;
were going to do health. Maybe before that it had been mostly family planning, right,&#13;
and then John Evans came in and he said we're going to really ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It would be odd that you'd be wrong on the date because you arrived in '79.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                         September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right, but then I didn't know what, you know--it's possible that it was&#13;
created then but didn'ttouch me very much. I was over in the research complex.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But what I mean if you remember John Evans's coming, you would not&#13;
remember it wrong if he came the same year you did. He must have ...&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: But I could be! You know, it's an easy thing to find out.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In fact, actually when ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: How long was Evans here?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Well, actually you are right. You know why? Because in 1980 I wrote&#13;
a background paper for the 1980 World Development Report on population and&#13;
poverty, and I remember John Evans being here at that time. The reason I remember&#13;
is that he liked that paper a lot, and he tried to bring me to his department a few years&#13;
later, you know, but at an--being new to the Bank, he wanted to bring me at a rather&#13;
high level, and the bureaucrats said, "What? This woman is, you know, down there in&#13;
the" [Laughter} So I remember now. You're right. He must have been here in '80.&#13;
So my dates are-you're right. So anyway, by--it must have been around '82, though,&#13;
that he'd gotten this department geared up and there started to do a lot more work on&#13;
health.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Because in the early '70s when they hired what became later the&#13;
environment expert, Dr. James Lee, he himself was a public health specialist, right?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Oh, I don't know. I never knew that&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But he came in as a public health person.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right. He was a doctor, I guess.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: He was a doctor himself also, and therefore the environmental issues&#13;
started as public health issues.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Mm-hmm. And then they sort of got off track. Now we're trying to&#13;
bring them back as health issues.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And I guess with Alan Berg and the nutrition thing there was that&#13;
component of health.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right, right. It did sort of--it's interesting that these issues, including&#13;
environment, but obviously health and nutrition, they were really on a low simmer on&#13;
a back burner for a long time.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah. Well, ifyou look at [RobertS.} McNamara's first explosions, his first&#13;
speeches, starting the very year he arrived, he very quickly got into talk about these&#13;
things. And from his very earliest speeches it sounded as if the Bank was going to&#13;
plunge into population, and he started out talking, said several things about health and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                          September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                      6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
so on. Then he began to talk more about population, but health seemed to be part of&#13;
the population stance.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Certainly, my impression is that it was mostly about population, and&#13;
then at some point he made the speech about rural development. So the population&#13;
really was more prominent, I would--that's my sense [both speaking at once] than&#13;
health or nutrition, and that combined with then the push on rural development which&#13;
was much easier to transform into lending. You know, once you said "rural&#13;
development," they just went out and did all these rural development projects all over&#13;
the place, which it was easy to spend money on, much easier than on population. And&#13;
so the effect was that you can sort of put a lot of money into small farmers&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: It was just easier to translate it. I mean, McNamara also, as I'm sure&#13;
you're going to be saying, was very keen on increasing the overall volume of lending,&#13;
so the easier transformation of that idea into lending made a big difference.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Sure.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: And then, of course, there was this constraint on lending for health,&#13;
which was unfortunate, I think--really unfortunate--because lending for family&#13;
planning was difficult and sensitive and complicated.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And has a lot ofbackdoors.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Oh, sure! I mean, it made a huge difference. I mean, people in the&#13;
population, the sort of so-called "hawks," I would call them-what I would call&#13;
"population hawks" in the Bank--they all said, "Oh, you know, we're not doing&#13;
enough, we're not doing enough." In fact, since '87 the doors have opened wide for&#13;
lending for family planning, and I think that the lending for family planning, much of&#13;
which is not-it's sort of quasi-hidden, depending on how you want to define things,&#13;
but it's just exploded in real terms because of the ability to do it in the context of&#13;
health.&#13;
&#13;
Well, it started in '82, actually, I should say, although initially under John Evans's&#13;
leadership people really were concerned with health per se, but as there was growing&#13;
understanding that everything's interlinked anyway, and I think even the 1984 WDR&#13;
on population had a lot about the health benefits of family planning. Family planning&#13;
and health projects just became much more common.&#13;
&#13;
And then actually what changed in '87 is that it was put, this sector, instead of being&#13;
in one central department competing with the regional departments for lending blocks,&#13;
this sector was put-you know, every country department had a division chief whose&#13;
mandate was to care about and push for PHN and education lending. So you sort of&#13;
saw--I would guess there was another spurt, but it was hard to measure, you know,&#13;
because there are lags in the preparation and people don't look at family planning per&#13;
se, but my guess is that you could see, if you could measure it properly, you would&#13;
see the Bank having a substantial increase in lending indirectly for family planning&#13;
starting around '82, once the '79 thing got built up, and then sort of another surge&#13;
&#13;
                                Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                         September 23,1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           7&#13;
&#13;
starting in '87, once the bureaucratic structure was set up so that every department had&#13;
somebody like me as an operational division chief sitting at the table where the&#13;
decisions were made about where lending priorities would be.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Did you sense that these issues began to be [inaudible} in the CPPs&#13;
[country program paper], so to speak?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Not important. Not important. I mean, I don't know the answer. I&#13;
don't know. But the fact that I don't know suggests to me that it's not that important in&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Even now.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Now it's much--when it gets into the CSP [country strategy plan] it's&#13;
because of these other things that I'm talking about. I bet there's much more in the&#13;
CSPs now, certainly the ones that I have some familiarity with, you know.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: So Brazil.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Brazil. There's much more talk about social sectors.&#13;
&#13;
Now, part of that in the last few years is the end of the SAL [structural adjustment&#13;
loan}, the glorification of the SAL. Now we're back to sort of fundamental human&#13;
resources and infrastructure, investment lending, you know. But part of it is also that,&#13;
starting in '87--I can't say how important I think this bureaucratic change is, but it&#13;
shows sort of the way you get these surprising effects from what appear to be random,&#13;
you know, institutional reorganizations. But up to '87 there was one department that I&#13;
was in, PHN, wasn't well integrated into the regional or country strategy. It was off&#13;
on the side. Now, the population hawks liked that because they were all together in&#13;
terms of critical minimum mass for population. And, you know, there was a certain&#13;
crusading mentality in some sense among some people in that department on&#13;
population, and the director, John North, who carne after John Evans, really&#13;
responded to Ernie [Ernest} Stem, and Ernie always pushed population. So, you&#13;
know, everybody was--a lot of people in that department were keen on population.&#13;
There was a constant debate about how important is health and whether to do projects&#13;
[inaudible} But the fact is that it wasn't integrated into the thinking of the people who&#13;
were working at the country level because it was a department over on the side. It&#13;
wasn't in any particular region; it was a free-standing--what did they call it? a COPD,&#13;
it stood for--like industry and energy were separate, too.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But that had a vice president.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right. Interesting, yeah. Good point.&#13;
&#13;
So then in '87 what happened is that this PHN was combined with education and put&#13;
in every country department. So it made a big difference; it made a big difference.&#13;
Certainly in my department, you know, we'd sit around, the management team, the&#13;
different division chiefs, agriculture, infrastructure,. and I had equal footing in that&#13;
department. And I could say, "Look, you know, Brazil--it's absurd. There needs to&#13;
be more and we should have." And 1 got more resources than Brazil would have&#13;
&#13;
                                 Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                          September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                         8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
gotten when there was a separate department dealing with--you know, one division&#13;
dealt with Latin America and West Africa or something, you know.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But the issue of intellectual ..&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Very important.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: .. the issue of population itself, the Bank--there has been quite some&#13;
division within the institution.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Oh, yeah. Still is.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: After all, even Larry [Lawrence H] Summers [inaudible] the issue, in&#13;
fact, in spite [inaudible] it doesn't matter.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Yes, see, I think the issue with population in the Bank is not so much&#13;
that some people think it's terribly important and some people think it's not terribly&#13;
important. It's that lots of people don't have a position on it particularly, I mean, who&#13;
are making critical decisions about resource allocation. You know, they're thinking&#13;
about the trade policy and the financial sector and the macroeconomic stabilization in&#13;
the 1980s. They're not against it, and so they need to hear why they should be for it.&#13;
&#13;
My own view, frankly, is that there's such good arguments for family planning&#13;
independent of any macro consequences of rapid population growth that-well, I&#13;
mean, that's basically what we did in Brazil, and I pushed it in the region, the Latin&#13;
America region, when I was there, too. Let's not keep doing studies that sort of show&#13;
the terrible consequences of rapid population growth. The intellectual basis isn't&#13;
really is there; well, there's a conceptual basis there, but we don't have the evidence,&#13;
and it'll be very difficult to get it. Fertility is falling anyway in Latin America, and&#13;
the issue is getting services to people who want the services-you know, even&#13;
unsubsidized. I mean, right now there's rationing. That would be my argument.&#13;
People can't get what they want and what they're willing to pay for. And there are&#13;
huge health benefits.&#13;
&#13;
So we, in that department, I--we did sector work on sort of women's health. You&#13;
know, we did a piece of sector work on women's health issues which included-you&#13;
know, for Brazil it's just dreadful incidence of ovarian cancer, which easily can be&#13;
detected and prevented, and very high rates of caesarian sections, and a whole host of&#13;
issues where there were just gross inefficiencies, you know, from a medical point of&#13;
view, a cost point of view, and a whole section on family planning, how women go&#13;
and get pills at the pharmacy and sometimes it's medically contraindicated and they're&#13;
not--and the government isn't playing any role in providing information.&#13;
&#13;
And, you know, this was very well received in Brazil because there's a huge feminist&#13;
movement there that has been very anti-AID [US. Agency for International&#13;
Development], you know, sterilization, constant articles in the newspaper about "the&#13;
Americans are coming and sterilizing all our women." I mean, it was all sort of&#13;
exaggerated and absurd since these poor women went and often paid for sterilization&#13;
themselves because they were so desperate to get the services. But it was all terribly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                          September 23,1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                            9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
distorted in Brazil, and I think we really made a contribution by trying to look at it in&#13;
a more rational way and inserted into the health and women's issues.&#13;
&#13;
And this kind of country-oriented thinking was going on all over the Bank, different&#13;
approaches. So it became much more decentralized. And the question sort of in&#13;
terms of the intellectual basis for doing population, what Larry thinks or what, you&#13;
know, Stem thinks or what [Edward VK.} Jaycox thought, it just became less&#13;
important. You had--that was a benefit ofthe decentralization.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I guess I'm just curious why this, your semantics, why has "population"&#13;
has not been a, quote, structural issue?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: In the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right, I mean as we know structural adjustment include all sorts of what&#13;
they call structural issues. Just look at the semantics of the word "structural." Why is&#13;
population not a structural issue?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Because it's-any costs of rapid population growth come in the long&#13;
term, and structural adjustment was very, you know, short to medium term. In fact,&#13;
some of the problems, criticisms that are legitimate of the way the Bank approached&#13;
adjustment lending in much of the '80s was insufficient attention to even medium-&#13;
term issues like creating, you know, a regulatory environment that was more friendly&#13;
to business or establishing property rights, that most of the emphasis was on short-&#13;
term policy levers because this was quick dispersing lending. So, you know, you got&#13;
changes in pricing policy or changes in exchange rate policy or changes in the trade&#13;
regime that you could argue for and then you could monitor. You know, you could&#13;
release the second tranche when they eliminated X percent of their QRs [quantitative&#13;
restrictions]. Right? Population, I mean, it's semantically a structural issue, but it&#13;
was certainly not something that you could handle in structural adjustment lending.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It's really interesting that you seem to see that this is all driven much more&#13;
by bureaucratic arrangements or logic than by concepts. The way population is often&#13;
talked about is a bit like-it's as you're suggesting-that there's this debate and the&#13;
Bank's really not interested enough or it is interested. But what you're saying is that&#13;
what's really driven--and you can see it in these jumps--you see the putting into&#13;
movement health lending as being a vehicle for [both speaking at once] that really&#13;
made a big difference.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right. I think that it's peculiar, but I agree. I mean, your statement of&#13;
what I'm saying is correct.. In contrast to many other issues in the Bank--I mean, I&#13;
don't think that that's true for many things. I think the Bank-it's a very analytic&#13;
culture, so a new analysis or a new concept which is intellectually convincing and&#13;
which attracts, you know, a consensus once it's on the table can lead to changes&#13;
independent of bureaucratic arrangements. So you have, you know, the move to&#13;
adjustment lending in the '80s is a very good example ofthat and possibly after&#13;
McNamara's speech on rural development, this slightly disastrous sort of leap into&#13;
these integrated rural development projects.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But no, but that was a special bureaucratic arrangement.&#13;
&#13;
                                 Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                          September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Also, uh-huh. Okay, well.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well, yes [all speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: But in response to ..&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I guess what one was saying is that the bureaucracy is a necessary condition&#13;
but it has to be able to function right.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Now, in the case of population and family planning, in the absence of&#13;
compelling consensus, I think the changes in the bureaucratic arrangements, and in&#13;
particular the decentralization in '87, made a difference because it allowed for a&#13;
variety of strategies to emerge which were much more attuned to country--much more&#13;
in tune with overall country strategy and attuned to country needs and sort of to the&#13;
requirements of the dialogue with the country.&#13;
&#13;
And so we still have a lack of consensus on the consequences of rapid population&#13;
growth, but it's not that important--or it shouldn't be that important. I mean, I think it&#13;
still may matter at the margin, you know, because the hawks won't sort of forget about&#13;
it. They want to keep talking about it and worrying about it, integrating population&#13;
into the CEMs [country economic memorandums] instead of just sort of establishing&#13;
an intellectual basis for family planning as a service. I mean, nobody--people want to&#13;
do health; they want to do health projects. There's no intellectual consensus about the&#13;
productivity effects of health projects, you know, and it hasn't been required for the&#13;
Bank to increase greatly lending for health. It's seen as, you know, an end in itself.&#13;
That's part of development, that people are healthy.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: That is quite in contrast to--I don't know if that's the right word-to, say,&#13;
primary education.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Yes, it is. It is. And I mean actually it's very complicated here&#13;
because I have also argued that the Bank should develop the intellectual basis for&#13;
more lending for health because there are productivity effects, and for nutrition as&#13;
well.     Â·&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: With the WDR?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: They are not as much as I would like, actually. You know the problem&#13;
is that the literature is rather thin, and fundamentally the difference is that you can&#13;
measure education returns, private returns, by looking at adult wages and comparing&#13;
wages by level of education. It's just so hard to do that for health. There are some&#13;
studies, you know, and I am sure the WDR will reflect them, but it won't be a ..&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: There used to be the earlier sort of {inaudible] efficiency where sort of&#13;
[both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: And there is other stuff. It is coming along, and it would help. It&#13;
would probably at the margin mean that some inside--we would have, just as we have&#13;
for education, I think, a much stronger argument for lending.&#13;
&#13;
                                Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                          September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But you think-I mean, I'm sorry, just one small thing--you said look for&#13;
health, you know, one should sort of see it as an end in itself. Why was it not seen&#13;
that way with primary education? I mean, the number of Bank publications must be&#13;
in the hundreds trying to prove high rates of return for primary education. Why was&#13;
that not seen as an end in itself and stop at that?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Well, I think it's easier for health than for the primary education. I&#13;
mean, nobody wants to die. You know, death is the worst outcome, or really&#13;
morbidity is.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It's more compelling!&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: It's much more compelling than whether you get fifth grade or only go&#13;
to fourth grade, you know, or whether you continue to ..&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Literacy ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I mean, the people like [Amartya] Sen have argued very strongly that it's&#13;
an end in itself.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: I mean, I don't know. I think that the work on education strengthened&#13;
an argument that was there anyway. Work on health could strengthen an argument&#13;
and might make a difference at the margin to how much resources, you know, of a&#13;
society go to health. It would be a good thing if we could strengthen the argument,&#13;
but really where I started was that for health it hasn't seemed that important to have&#13;
that argument. And I do think that on family planning it's exactly analogous. You&#13;
can argue on the sort of macro consequences which is vaguely analogous to high rates&#13;
of return on education, right? Or you can argue on immediate welfare benefits, both&#13;
health and, you know, women being able to plan their lives and being, seeing that&#13;
their daughters can plan. I think it's a huge change for women in everything.&#13;
&#13;
So I've sort of been unhappy, even in this recent paper on family planning that's been&#13;
done in the PHR [Population and Human Res(Jurces] department. There was a paper&#13;
that went to the Board [of Executive Directors] recently. It's better than it was in&#13;
draft, but I mean the first draft was all about population growth. And I went to the&#13;
meeting, even though I was in this department and it wasn't my business anymore,&#13;
and argued, "You know, this is our opportunity to put family planning intellectually in&#13;
the Bank as a fantastic development program. Its immediate welfare benefits are just&#13;
huge."&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah, I know exactly what you mean. I was frustrated myself. People&#13;
always discuss this at a macro, general productivity level, and the thing, you know,&#13;
gets so abstract [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right, and you can argue forever.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: And people aren't looking at the woman in her house, six kids, doesn't want&#13;
any more, and the obvious, enormous liberation it means to her just to be able to do&#13;
what she wants to do.&#13;
&#13;
                                Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                         September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right. And let her pay for it, if she wants.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Let her pay. Just giving her the means to do what she ...&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: So I think that there's a slow movement in that direction, you know.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But health spending has broadened enormously, and it seems to be driven in&#13;
this sense that it's an end in itself is being enough to carry it. But health is much&#13;
smaller than education lending.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Still, is it?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Like a third?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Something like that. And I wonder whether the Bank, even though it's&#13;
changing, the Bank has always needed this justification for lending.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right. It may be a constraint. It may not be just as I was--it may be&#13;
more of a constraint than I-yeah. It depends on what you're comparing. Compared&#13;
to education, yes, if you had this productivity argument, I bet we would have more&#13;
lending to health. But if you compare health to family planning, then you would say&#13;
for family planning, "Let's go, at least for awhile, with this basic needs welfare&#13;
argument, at least to get into family planning," you know? [both speaking at once]&#13;
So it's sort of--and why not have both arguments for a number of these?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah. It's funny, in looking at the Bank-you came here when the Bank&#13;
was in the middle of a debate, I mean, on basic needs.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right. I remember [Shahid J.j Burki and all that stuff.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The Bank was ..&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Or was it a debate, or was there sort of a couple of years When&#13;
everybody just got on that bandwagon?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yes, it was [all speaking at once] A lot of people [inaudible] They&#13;
thought the redistribution with growth strategy would be--that would be sort of left ..&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Behind.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: .. behind.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But it was a debate.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: It was a debate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                   Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                          September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It didn't appear as a debate because everyone for a while gave lip service to&#13;
the slogan.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right. Right. It had a very [both speaking at once] intellectual basis.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Well, the thing is this: it's kind of odd because you see in the records, the&#13;
Bank went through two, three years, discussions, studies, reports, all those things.&#13;
[Paul] Streeten came and [inaudible] Heckman came ..&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Mahbub ul-Haq [all speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Mahbub was driving this, [Paul] Isenman, Burki. And people like Stem&#13;
were muttering and, you know, "It's productivity"-and other, a lot of people you&#13;
see, most ofthem seem, in the committee records of the President's Council-! mean,&#13;
it's in the papers, people are making statements that are obviously not happy with this.&#13;
They don't see the need for it. Or they object, but more directly, that it costs too&#13;
much.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And also it's only for consumption.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right. No productivity, and the Bank has to lend for productivity.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Strong sense of trade-offs.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right. The legal department may have even been making noises&#13;
[inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Okay, but no one is talking, no one is denying that as ends in themselves,&#13;
these are things that have value. And then the Bank kind of gears up; it finally goes to&#13;
the Board and [inaudible] and the WDR ...&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Which had a lot of growth arguments, that WDR, definite growth&#13;
oriented arguments.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: It wasn't a basic needs WDR at all.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: No.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But it was a swansong of basic needs as best.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That's the thing. This all sort of culminates in print in a number of ways,&#13;
and it's the swansong. It just sounds as ifthe Bank is launching it but in effect ..&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: It was the end.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: [both speaking at once] .. the Bank is killing it. And McNamara--for&#13;
instance, at one point there's a debate on basic needs and water and sewerage, and&#13;
everyone was praising this paper, great paper, this is what is going on, this is what we&#13;
&#13;
                                 Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                          September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                           14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
need. And McNamara suddenly said, "Yes, but you have to remember that every&#13;
project has to have full cost recovery." Now, full cost recovery is sort of the absolute&#13;
antithesis of [all speaking at once] basic needs. And you see these things all along&#13;
that are holding back.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: I'm really surprised to hear you call the 1980 WDR the "swanson g."&#13;
[all speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Let me explain, because I think it is and it isn't. That's the whole point,&#13;
because in terms of the "basic needs" terminology it is.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Well, it didn't use that terminology. If it's the swansong of"basic&#13;
needs" ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: But everything that people were talking about begins to happen, because it's&#13;
really shortly after that that health department--and it's really in the '80s that the&#13;
social sector lending begins to grow. And now, of course, it's exploding. So it's kind&#13;
of odd because the Bank kills the terminology, but it kind of goes for the substance.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But as far as health lending goes, if you see the '79 basic needs, you see&#13;
them banking on--in fact, it's so ironical. This morning [Lewis T.] Preston announced&#13;
that the Bank will increase its lending for sewerage and water by some percent. So&#13;
some of the very things which the basic needs strategy that that group had called for,&#13;
sharp increases in Bank lending, went completely down shortly after that, but now it's&#13;
as if'79, '80 [inaudible] It's quite striking.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Yeah, I do think-I mean, take the example of water and sewerage.&#13;
The intellectual groundwork is much stronger now, and that--it is an example for me&#13;
where, because of this sort of analytic culture, much of the investment made in&#13;
figuring out what the issue is may be very [inaudible] and that intellectual basis&#13;
includes much more emphasis on cost recovery. In other words, it's not a basic needs-&#13;
-it's not the traditional old-fashioned, late '70s "basic needs" mtionale that's&#13;
compelling a move toward more lending for water and sewerage. It's the&#13;
environmental issues for sure, combined with a sort of merging of our understanding&#13;
of how to improve the efficiency of service delivery, of our understanding of, that&#13;
there's willingness to pay for these services, that the poor, in the absence of public&#13;
arrangements, given marginal costs are zero and so on and so on, so that the pricing&#13;
problem is complicated, that if you don't create the infrastructure at the public level,&#13;
then the poor pay for water that is trucked in, you know, by commercial sellers and&#13;
they pay much more.&#13;
&#13;
So there's just--it's not sort ofthe--1 don't want to call it crude, but maybe what&#13;
happened in the late '70s or early '80s is important to put these things on the map.&#13;
But in fact I don't think that, as you're suggesting, the analytic basis for lending was&#13;
fully established. It wasn't shown the extent to which it was a public good and why&#13;
should government be involved at all, and that wasn't all worked out in the case of&#13;
water and sewerage--and maybe not even yet in the case of health.&#13;
&#13;
There was sort of a--a lot of work in the '80s was sector work at the country level on&#13;
health systems, and a lot of it was sort of trying to establish how inefficient these&#13;
&#13;
                                 Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                          September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
systems were so that lending would actually reduce, potentially reduce overall&#13;
spending while increasing services. You know that there was [inaudible] and&#13;
maldistribution and all kinds of distortions in a set of services which the government&#13;
sort of had a lock hold on. A lot of the discussion in the '80s, even in health, that&#13;
goes along with the private sector and the pricing issues that I was working on in the&#13;
early '80s in the Country Policy Department, I mean really all that work was--we&#13;
were pushing for cost recovery--not full cost recovery--but we were pushing for user&#13;
charges and trying to establish the intellectual basis for user charges and trying to&#13;
establish for health the extent to which public spending was not reaching the poor,&#13;
you know, all the urban populations. And I think a lot of that went on with the water&#13;
stuff, too.&#13;
&#13;
So that now we sort of--you know, it's complicated, and it takes time. But I see it as&#13;
not so much-I see the 1980 WDR for that reason as not the swansong but as the&#13;
beginning of clarifying that there is more to this than a basic needs, merit good&#13;
approach. There was this seamless web where everything's related and productivity--&#13;
there was an emphasis on the productivity benefits, and maybe it slept for awhile.&#13;
You know, I mean the fact is that in '82 we had the, you know, the debt crisis and&#13;
huge adjustment--and so of course it was reasonable for a lot of the effort in the Bank&#13;
and thinking to go into the short-term adjustment problems. But I think that's actually&#13;
a great benefit of the way the Bank is and what it is, that, you know, okay, a lot of&#13;
people went off and worried about adjustment, but because it's a big institution with a&#13;
lot of people interested in a lot of different things, there was still going to be--there&#13;
was still the infrastructure to have people working away on the health sector and&#13;
working away on, you know, pricing policies for the social sectors and sanitation, and&#13;
all this stuff was still going on. It may not have been ..&#13;
&#13;
[End Tape 1, Side A]&#13;
[Begin Tape 1, Side B}&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: .. when the worst of the adjustment problems, given that most of those&#13;
problems are now sort of behind us, I think more intellectual energy is returning to&#13;
these issues that are associated with investment lending and it's sort of surfacing, but&#13;
the groundwork was there all along.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The groundwork and, as it were, it had been planted in the bureaucracy.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Yeah, exactly. Perfect.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: So that's it, there's this sort of fanciful image of seeds [inaudible] that were&#13;
developing through the '80s.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Which I think is a tribute to the institution, frankly. I mean, just as in&#13;
the '70s when people were sort of talking about basic needs, there were people&#13;
working on debt. I mean, that turned out to be bad because a lot of what they were&#13;
saying was kind of suppressed. But that was going on, too. And there were people&#13;
who were developing the human capital to be able to begin to handle the new issues&#13;
when they did arise. So, I mean for all the problems with a big bureaucracy I think&#13;
that it's worth noting that the bigness and the sort of"Christmas tree-like" effort--you&#13;
know, so many people working on so many different issues--has benefits.&#13;
&#13;
                                Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                          September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah. It's been quite a change in the way people have seen-certainly&#13;
education but a little bit of health is coming into this--these things. When people&#13;
talked about them in the '60s and even through the '70s, they were still talked about&#13;
as consumption costs. It was daring to talk about productivity, and it wasn't taken&#13;
sort of very weighty. But now I'm quite amazed at how much the Bank has turned&#13;
around. Now it's almost as if it were a new religion.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: On education?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah. It's sort of--even now, without any sense of qualification or&#13;
embarrassment, I would say, "This is the highest possible return of all the" --Summers&#13;
the other day said, "Investments [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: In educating girls.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: .. "in women's education, there's no higher productivity investment in the&#13;
world." A little bit of hype, really.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Except he says that machinery is the other one.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Oh, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: In a different paper he said no higher value than machinery and equipment.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: In the paper with [J Bradford} DeLong?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yeah, DeLong.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: But that's for developed, for OECD [Organisation for Economic Co-&#13;
operation and Development} countries. So it's okay. No, it's not hype. He's serious,&#13;
and it's true.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: I know. We know he's serious.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: I don't consider it hype at all. I mean, if you look at the combinations&#13;
of private returns from the social returns in educating girls, you know, it's ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: No, but it' s-I think his [inaudible} is there still is a marked difference [all&#13;
speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: The a huge change ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: It's the very fact that he could say that's so unrevokably.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Yeah, but I mean, you know, to what extent is he--it may be a ease--l&#13;
think there is a change. On the other hand, I wouldn't say that Larry is reflecting that&#13;
change. I think he's reinforcing it by his own prestige, by his own analysis and by his&#13;
own observation. So he's marking the change, but he's also reinforcing it--I hope--on&#13;
the girls' education, anyway. I mean, I think that the fact that he chose to talk about&#13;
&#13;
                                Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                         September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
that when he went to Pakistan last January was a real sign of leadership from a chief&#13;
economist.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Where has this chang~ come from, then? Some of it is individual?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Yes, some of it is idiosyncratic. [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: From the external environment, also? The whole world's changing?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Some of it is-some of it is looking for a new-look, some of it is the&#13;
emphasis behind, "We're going to go back to investment lending," right? So if you&#13;
wanted to look for a crude sort of bureaucratic explanation, look at what's going to&#13;
happen to the lending program for a big country. Mexico is a good example. They&#13;
absorbed huge amounts of lending for adjustments in the mid to late '80s: every year&#13;
3 or 400 million or something. So they're now faced with--the Bank is now faced&#13;
with an embarrassment of negative net transfers for a country like Mexico, I suspect.&#13;
I don't know the details. So, all right, well, we don't want to do more adjustment&#13;
lending because that doesn't make sense anymore, given the situation in Mexico.&#13;
They're doing all the policy reforms. They may not have-it may be hard to show&#13;
they have a balance of payments problem-that's not true for Mexico now, I suppose,&#13;
but you know. So we have to--but we want to transfer resources because we want to&#13;
keep these debtors happy, you know, or they might stop paying us back! This is my&#13;
rude explanation, right?! So this motivates some serious thinking about "we really&#13;
gotta go in there with big infrastructure, big human resources projects!" Okay?&#13;
That's one explanation. Second explanation: all the other ones we talked about, the&#13;
seeds growing over time ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: People--for instance, I mean, you've done a lot of--you've been one of the&#13;
persons who has done a lot of the work that has educated people here. [inaudible}&#13;
also. Who else?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: I think Manny [Emmanuel Y.} Jimenez.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Really? What work has he done? I haven't-I'm not familiar with his&#13;
work.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: He got involved in the pricing issues. When I left Lyn Squire's&#13;
division to work on the WDR in '84, Lyn said to me, "You find somebody that can&#13;
finish what you started." And Manny is the one that I picked to [inaudible] He'd&#13;
been a consultant, he'd been around the Bank on urban issues. So he came in. Now,&#13;
his. work initially was much more on this pricing stuff, but, I mean, I think that's been&#13;
quite important, frankly, in helping to justify both the--by clarifying what the&#13;
externality issues,you know, "What's the rationale for government involvement?&#13;
And, given that rationale, what's the right way to design projects? Who should pay?&#13;
What's the role of the private sector?" That was sort of in tune with the adjustment&#13;
issues that were in the air. You know, it was a way to--what would you say?--to help&#13;
a larger community of economists in the Bank to see the social sectors as a legitimate&#13;
area of economic work, where you could use economic thinking to create the basis for&#13;
the role of government and therefore the role of the Bank's lending. So in essence&#13;
what Manny--the kind of work that Manny did on the cost and pricing issues. You&#13;
&#13;
                                Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                          September 23,1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
know, all these things are going--Lyn Squire, an obvious person by working in both&#13;
macro and micro but being, you know, very privy to the micro issues as ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: How do you see the role of the number one and number twos, President&#13;
[Barber B.} Conable and any of the VPs [vice presidents} had a personal ...&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: I mean, Stern was always--! think he was kind of sort of vaguely&#13;
negative, in fact, frankly, on the family planning by, you know, constantly pushing it&#13;
and rattling people. I remember when I was in the PHN department with John North&#13;
that there was some project--it was a department that did projects and also had my&#13;
group that did the research and policy work--and some project on Brazil or some&#13;
place, I don't know, Africa, went up, a heath project, maybe. And Stern wrote a note&#13;
on the appraisal, "Where is the population?" you know. "This can't go without&#13;
population." And my view was that John North should call him up and say, "You're&#13;
full of shit. You're wrong. Y au don't understand." It was this project like in Niger,&#13;
you know, the first health project in Niger, French-speaking West Africa. You know,&#13;
the French are so sort of anti-family planning in the African context. I mean, it was&#13;
ridiculous, really. So instead of John North picking up the phone and telling Ernie to&#13;
go to hell, you know--which probably Ernie would have just listened and said, "Yeah,&#13;
you're right. Okay."-there was a week of staff time and writing memos and, oh, you&#13;
know, changing the SAR, none of which had anything, any effect on the real outcome&#13;
of what this project, what the money ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And I think he had-I've seen from getting other memos-he had a quite a&#13;
negative effect in the late '70s in India's family planning program, that he really went&#13;
along with the whole sterilization campaign as vice president for South Asia. People&#13;
in Delhi, his own staff in Delhi, were telling him, "Look, if we get associated we will&#13;
be tarred with the same brush." And that's what happened.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right. Yeah. No, I mean I think that this whole--and that was that&#13;
actually related--McNamara has also always taken a very hawkish view on&#13;
population.&#13;
&#13;
I don't know if this is relevant, but it's a quick story and sort of fun, looking back on&#13;
it. When I was doing the WDR on population, Anne Krueger was the vice president.&#13;
And at some point you have to have your outline or your first draft, I don't know. We&#13;
went and had a meeting with Anne and myself and Stern, and there were some other&#13;
people, I suppose, in the room. So Stern looks at this, and he says, "You know, you&#13;
have to make this much more compelling, this argument about population growth and&#13;
the problems. So put this-you know, this chapter should go first, and this chapter ..&#13;
." And I remember Anne Krueger and Michalopoulos--did you know Michalopoulos,&#13;
or did you leave before he came?&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: No, I don't remember.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: He's still in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Michael Michalopoulos?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Constant [Constantine] Michalopoulos.&#13;
&#13;
                                 Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                          September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                      19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: He created that ..&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right, right. He was Anne's sort of guy.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: There's that group which is ..&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Oh, I remember now.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: So Anne and Constant are saying, "Yes, yes, yes." So I had never&#13;
really had a meeting with Ernie before, you know, and I was unaware or thought it&#13;
irrelevant that he might chop my head off, I guess, I don't know. Actually, he had&#13;
always sort of liked me because I had worked on the [Lester B.] Pearson Commission&#13;
report, you know, a hundred of years back, and for some reason he remembered me&#13;
from that time.&#13;
&#13;
So I said, "Oh, I really can't do that. There's no justification; it would be very&#13;
controversial. We can't take the line that McNamara has taken. The literature is&#13;
changing. The world is changing. The report will say that there's a problem but, you&#13;
know, it has to be balanced in terms of what the real issues are" and yadda yadda&#13;
yadda.&#13;
&#13;
So Ernie said, "Well, you know, you think about it."&#13;
&#13;
But that was it! I got my way!&#13;
&#13;
And that's why, frankly, when I went to--that was before these episodes when I was in&#13;
this Population, Health and Nutrition Department, and that's why I was always like,&#13;
"Just tell him. Tell him."&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: He won't, you know-he'll cave in if you have a good argument.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah. He's pretty rational.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Yeah! Absolutely. He's fine, but he didn't--I think that he lost touch&#13;
with how people weren't coming back.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Yeah, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I was wondering if, you know, like the arguments [inaudible] ag research,&#13;
literature [inaudible] research. And the Bank, you know, there are people who&#13;
recognize that diseases, especially morbidity and disease, there are diseases ori which&#13;
very little research is done in all those countries simply because-malaria or&#13;
whatever--they're so much endemic only to particular regions. So the Bank tried-&#13;
there were two projects which it did very well, blindness and the tropical disease&#13;
eradication program.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Which one--the second one?&#13;
&#13;
                                Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                         September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                    20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: The tropical diseases.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right. With WHO [World Health Organization).&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right. Both of which seemed to have, for very little investment ..&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Had huge impacts.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Had huge impacts. There's been a particular reluctance pfthe Bank to&#13;
finance research on problems--and I've seen that in energy and industry, also--&#13;
research per se on issues which are somewhat peculiar to their borrowers and for&#13;
which, despite all the arguments that the market will respond, one knows that the&#13;
market will not. Why do you think that has been, and why has it not pushed, say, for&#13;
health much more?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right. I think that's a good question. I mean, maybe it's just lack of&#13;
leadership. I mean, the Bank has been heavily involved in CGIAR [Consultative&#13;
Group on International Agricultural Research].&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right. And why not a similar-leprosy, malaria?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Yeah, I think it contributes to the contraception, human reproduction,&#13;
whatever it is, with WHO and the tropical disease research. Why not more? One&#13;
hypothesis would be that ..&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I mean, have there been debates on this?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: No. I mean I think there's really--this is another hobbyhorse of mine.&#13;
Sector economics in the Bank is always the stepchild. If you think of the leadership&#13;
in agriculture in the Bank, it has tended to be economists. You know, you had Ed [G.&#13;
Edward] Schuh. He, I think, is an economist. But if you think of population, health,&#13;
and education, we've had the educator, the Ethiopian guy ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Wadi Haddad?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: No, not Wadi Haddad. How could I forget his name! A very&#13;
wonderful man. He was Ethiopian. He left the Bank a couple of years ago. [Aklilu&#13;
Habte] He was head of the education department for a while. We had John North,&#13;
who was some sort of Bank bureaucrat personnel guy; we had John Evans, who was a&#13;
doctor. We now have Ann Hamilton, who is not an economist or not, sort of--her role&#13;
or the reason she got that job had nothing to do with intellectual leadership in those&#13;
sectors; she'd never worked in those sectors. Now my view is that this-then you&#13;
have other structural things like if you want to be a lead economist in the Bank, then&#13;
fundamentally you have to be working on country macro-type issues. There's no&#13;
economist stream for sector economists. Sector economists have to become--to be&#13;
promoted have to, like me, become division chiefs and really not be working as much&#13;
on economics. You know, you have George Psacharopoulos, who has the one job in&#13;
the Bank, really, that's for human resources at a high technical level. And you have&#13;
Manny Jimenez, who--we're lucky-you know, agreed to go to that department where&#13;
&#13;
                                Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                         September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                             21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    he's really working as an economist, but he is a division chief with a lot of&#13;
                    management. What you see is a lot of good people in the Bank in sector economics&#13;
                    who leave because of the problems of not having upward mobility. You have&#13;
                    [Visvanathan] Rajagopalan as the vice president for sector economists.&#13;
&#13;
                    KAPUR: He has no background?&#13;
&#13;
                    BIRDSALL: He's an engineer. So this has always irritated me a lot, and I think--1&#13;
                    hope that some changes can eventually be made. But in the meantime we've had 15&#13;
                    years, in effect, of systems in which sector, the sectors, leadership in the sectors&#13;
                    comes from doctors, engineers-Tony [Anthony A.} Churchill is an economist, so that&#13;
                    is sort of an exception.&#13;
&#13;
                    KAPUR: But there's a flip side. I mean, the industry and energy has never had--&#13;
                    seldom had engineers to head it.&#13;
&#13;
                    BIRDSALL: Right. They're usually economists from the mainstream.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               ~    KAPUR: Which, of course, riles those [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               '~&#13;
                    BIRDSALL: Of course. And, you know--but these sectors like environment are&#13;
                    having the same problem. I mean, there are some-I can't tell you how many people&#13;

         Ji         much better environment. And so it's a--now why did I get off on this sort of rant and&#13;
                    rave?&#13;
&#13;
                    KAPUR: We started on the research on health.&#13;
&#13;
                    BIRDSALL: No, why, you asked why there's not more money to research activities.&#13;
&#13;
                    KAPUR: Right. Or supporting a CGIAR equivalent.&#13;
&#13;
                    BIRDSALL: Right. And that's one hypothesis. There hasn't been anybody to insist&#13;
                    on it in a way that speaks to the sort of policymakers inside the Bank who decide. I&#13;
                    mean, after all, that kind of money has to be taken away from lending, which is bread&#13;
                    and butter.&#13;
&#13;
                    KAPUR: Well, at least some of the money [drowned out by sirens] CGIAR.&#13;
&#13;
                    BIRDSALL: But somebody has to argue for it. I remember there were lots of&#13;
                    memos even for this human reproduction program which is like 400,000 dollars a&#13;
                    year. Every year there were these memos, oooh.&#13;
&#13;
                    KAPUR: But are you sure that the opposition is not interfered from the U.S.? I&#13;
                    mean, that's quite clear that when Ernie tried up to build up to support a 100 million&#13;
&#13;
                                                    Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                                              September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        22&#13;
&#13;
dollar endowment in 1986 for research for industry and energy--I have seen the&#13;
proposal ..&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: The U.S. objected?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Well, that's for sure.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: On what grounds?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Well, you know, on {inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Oh, industry and energy. Yeah, but it would be much--that wouldn't&#13;
be an issue for tropical disease research, would it?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right. Well, I'm not sure.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: No, it wouldn't be. I mean the whole--but nobody's made that&#13;
argument forcefully in the Bank. But the whole issue is that there's no market for&#13;
tropical disease research--it's awfully thin--because poor people get those diseases.&#13;
So it's, you see, it's sort of ideal for international public financing.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Did the Bank ever look into powdered milk and maternal feeding?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Yeah, there was sort of--what did the Bank think--there was some ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Probably the Swiss Nestle ...&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: The Nestle boycott. There was a lot of discussion. I'm not sure&#13;
whether the Bank ever took a position. We probably tried to avoid taking a position.&#13;
Maybe not. I think we came-l think actually we finally did come out in support of&#13;
it.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: In support of what, the boycott proposition?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: In support of the position that there should not be--well, in support of&#13;
the position that breast feeding is better, particularly in poor, you know, unsanitary&#13;
environments.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But you think that--or at least there's a perception that on these issues the&#13;
Bank's voice is much softer than when it comes to {inaudible] whereas on these, you&#13;
know ...&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: But part of that is that there are these outside lobbying groups who--&#13;
never enough. I mean, no matter what the Bank does. I mean, look at environment.&#13;
You know, no matter what the Bank says or does, it will never be--same with&#13;
population. No matter how much we do and don't do--or what we say--there will be&#13;
these groups that say the Bank isn't doing enough. I think we have to learn to be&#13;
thick-skinned about some of that, you know, just sort of minimize the political&#13;
damage. But it's an interesting question.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                         September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                        23&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I mean, on agricultural research even CGIAR for Africa is probably insufficient. You&#13;
know, the Bank is not well set up, unfortunately, for financing research or for&#13;
financing long-term training of people, which would probably be very high return&#13;
investments in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Well, they tried [inaudible] the failure of ACBI.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: The what?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Africa Capacity Building Initiative.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Oh, has that been a failure?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Oh, yes. I think it has.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: It's all [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And that was with huge amounts of money, 100 million dollars. The Bank&#13;
would never go in and do anything with two million or three million and see what&#13;
happens. It supports a steamroller. [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: But why--even Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation don't&#13;
finance as much kind of training as they used to 20 years ago, you know, bringing&#13;
people--putting 100 or 300 people in graduate schools in the U.S. There's this thing&#13;
of, you know-1 think it's crazy, but--people should be trained where they are and the&#13;
brain-drain, you know. Anyway. The Bank is poorly set up for that. It's not really&#13;
our-1 would say there ought to be other institutions doing more of that.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: But that's the way lending is, because lending is only to countries. It's not&#13;
to ..&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right. That's the problem. That's the problem. So everything else is&#13;
ad hoc. Even CGIAR is sort of ad hoc.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: What about research? The Bank is also--it stayed away from financing local&#13;
research. It hasn't--1 want to say it's all just wanted the highest quality research so&#13;
that--1 still find it a bit uncomfortable that all an institution like the Bank hasn't got&#13;
something to-IDB [Inter-American Development Bank] right now has launched this&#13;
program; it had its competition. Latin American research institutions were all invited&#13;
to submit proposals for roughly 50,000 dollar contracts to study something or other.&#13;
Nothing much might come of it, but it's really ...&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: That's great. Let there be some wasted, or apparently wasted. I agree.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Have you ever heard discussions in the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Oh, yes, there have been. Yes.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Did the [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                          September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                      24&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: In fact, you could go and ask for--if they kept minutes; Dennis de Tray&#13;
might remember--Stan [Stanley] Fischer had a meeting of the research committee in&#13;
Baltimore. It must have been in '88, '89. I remember going for like a day and a half,&#13;
and it was ...&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I have Stan Fisher's files on that.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Yes, it might be in there. There were outside people like Tony&#13;
[Anthony B.] Atkinson, maybe, or Jere Behrman. I can't remember. They were&#13;
pushing for the Bank opening up, not--they were pushing for it just opening up, you&#13;
know, including to them.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Well, that would always be a part of it.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: And sort of like the NSF [US. National Science Foundation] financing.&#13;
more research that was not developed by the staff inside. And so there's this&#13;
discussion of--there was a lot of discussion about that. That was definitely something&#13;
that they wanted.&#13;
&#13;
And there must have been some discussion of the need to get more researchers from&#13;
developing countries. That's--since '85, at least--has always been an issue. There's&#13;
all this work on the Africa economic research group that Dennis de Tray was involved&#13;
in. And it's still the case that a research proposal is better received if it involves an&#13;
institution in a developing country. There's quite a high-but it's just very difficult&#13;
because ofthe trade-offthat people feel that [inaudible] because a lot of people who&#13;
put up research proposals from departments like this one, you know, they want to&#13;
work with the best people. They're responding to incentives to get publications.&#13;
[both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I don't know ifl would really agree with you. I think there's a lot of basic&#13;
initial contacts. People at Princeton have pals here and vice versa. I mean, you know,&#13;
I was just calculating external [inaudible] The cost of a professor at the Delhi School&#13;
of Economics who would [inaudible] quite easily get a job here. The difference in&#13;
emoluments of what he would get in the Bank is a factor of75, and 75 is not--and one&#13;
would have say that is the quality that different.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Well, maybe there's a problem of information, the high cost of&#13;
information?&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I was just tabulating the number of just Princeton faculty that spend their&#13;
summers in the Bank and Fund.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: It's huge, I'm sure.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: And Harvard and, you know.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: It shows that there're high transactions costs associated with getting in&#13;
touch with the guy in Delhi.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Right, but also I think the institution has not made&#13;
&#13;
                                 Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                          September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                     25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Hasn't created enough pressure, yeah.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: I mean, why should I go to, you know, place X ifl can ...&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: No, I wasn't arguing with that I agree with you. There hasn't been&#13;
enough pressure in the face of tremendous incentives to work with people that you're&#13;
familiar with, that are close, that you can reach by phone, that can come here quickly,&#13;
that you know from graduate school, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. So you have to&#13;
have--but there's always been an effort; it's just insufficient But the competition idea&#13;
is terrific. We should do that Really. You know, why not? You know, because&#13;
among other things it could reduce the search costs of finding good researchers.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Sure. That's right; that's a good information mechanism.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Even if you threw away the 50,000 in five out often cases, the returns&#13;
to the other five could extend well beyond the particular piece of work they did. If&#13;
you found, you know, three young people that could then, you could work with over a&#13;
long time ...&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It's also a fantastic PR device.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Oh, absolutely fantastic.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Yeah, one would have thought even, at least from the PR point of view ..&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: That's the bad side.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: No, that itself ought to have been such a thing like this.&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: I actua11y suggested--you know, in the Bank this guy that has, runs this&#13;
vetiver grass, he has a little research competition, and I mentioned it to Larry once&#13;
after--what's his name? I forget.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: It begins with a G. He's the ag division chief for Asia. [Richard G.&#13;
Grimshaw]&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Right, the technical, right, or Africa.&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: No, not ...&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: No, it is Asia, you're right. And I mentioned this to Larry. Maybe 1'11&#13;
send him a note that, you know, we could do it Each year it could be a different&#13;
subject.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway. I should stop here. Are you near the end of your-this is great fun. [all&#13;
speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                         September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       26&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: It's marvelous; it's marvelous for us. An end in itself.&#13;
&#13;
There's just one more piece of the story that I'd like to touch on at least. What's&#13;
pushed this growth of social sector lending-well, the social cost of adjustment being&#13;
extraneous, and what I wonder is how you see that fitting with the other things. Is this&#13;
something that's helping, hurting, conflicts? Is it a different group of people?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: It's helping for all the wrong reasons. You know, I think it's not--&#13;
there's no strong evidence that adjustment programs have had terrible social costs, you&#13;
know, in my view. You know, everybody's, at an aggregate level, aggregate&#13;
[inaudible] there should be some consumption spending. But the whole UNICEF&#13;
[United Nations International Children's Emergency Fund] thing was based on really&#13;
flimsy evidence. But it's had a good effect, I think. It's, you know, that kind of&#13;
outside pressure has made a difference.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: Is it creating any distortions in the way social sector programs are being&#13;
carried out? Distortions--by that I mean this pushing them in directions which are not&#13;
the best, in your opinion?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: I don't think so, no.&#13;
&#13;
WEBB: No? More urban? More [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
KAPUR: Political feasibility?&#13;
&#13;
BIRDSALL: Well, yes. I guess I could give you one example which I think is--&#13;
people will disagree, but I think it's a distortion. So in a sense I agree with you,&#13;
although it's just one example.&#13;
&#13;
There's obsession over these social funds because of the so-called social costs&#13;
of adjustment. So, you know, you see it kind ofhappening everywhere. "Well, we've&#13;
got an adjustment program; we're going to do all these things, and so we have to deal&#13;
with social costs so we'll have a social fund." Like in Bolivia, the emergency social&#13;
fund. Well, that's probably not a bad thing, but I think it has permitted avoidance of&#13;
dealing with the fundamental need for restructuring the way social programs are&#13;
financed, so instead of going into a country and saying, "You know, you're spending&#13;
all your money, 99 percent of your recurrent budget, on middle class teachers, and&#13;
you don't have any books" or, "You're spending all your money on the hospitals, and&#13;
you don't have any drugs" or, "Half of your budget goes to universities instead of only&#13;
ten percent, and you should let the private market evolve for university-type training&#13;
and put your public money into primary and secondary schools." Those discussions,&#13;
they're still going on, but they're going on by the people who--the seeds, you know,&#13;
that were planted. Those people are still struggling at sector level to deal with these&#13;
issues. Then comes the country economist with his 400 million dollars, you know,&#13;
backed by the sort of mainstream "we're going to do this big adjustment program,"&#13;
doesn't talk to this poor guy who's been struggling with the sector work, who, by the&#13;
way, has very little leadership, you know. He's over here; his project people think&#13;
he's a pain in the neck. They just want to build more schools and clinics. This poor&#13;
sector economist is writing down what a disaster the whole arrangement is and how&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                 Nancy Birdsall&#13;
                          September 23, 1992- Verbatim&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     we should not rush in and build more schools or do more lending for, you know,&#13;
     vocational training institutes or something.&#13;
&#13;
     So that's the problem. It's hard to criticize these social funds; they probably do a little&#13;
     bit of good. But they do seem to me to have permitted us, the sort of mainstream&#13;
     people with the big money, to just have this sugar-coating things.&#13;
&#13;
     WEBB: You want to mention one example?&#13;
&#13;
     BIRDSALL: Well, I think the Bolivian one might be. Where else are they doing&#13;
     these social funds?&#13;
&#13;
     KAPUR: All ofEast Europe.&#13;
&#13;
     WEBB: India?&#13;
&#13;
     KAPUR: India, 500 million.&#13;
&#13;
i    BIRDSALL: For--run by a separate institution?&#13;
&#13;
I    KAPUR: National renewal fund, which is basically . . [all speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
l&#13;
.i&#13;
l&#13;
     BIRDSALL: India would be a good example. I mean, the problems in India are ...&#13;
&#13;
     KAPUR: What does that do for [both speaking at once]&#13;
I&#13;
'&#13;
     BIRDSALL: It's public works ..&#13;
&#13;
     KAPUR: No, this is for public sector workers who were fired.&#13;
&#13;
     BIRDSALL: Oh, it's like a severance pay, is that it? Well, okay. I mean, there's a&#13;
     separate rationale for that, maybe.&#13;
&#13;
     KAPUR: But it comes under poverty.&#13;
&#13;
     BIRDSALL: And under social costs of adjustment. Yes. So it's a subtle criticism--!&#13;
     don't know if I'd call it a distortion ..&#13;
&#13;
     WEBB: Yeah, it's not the best word.&#13;
&#13;
     BIRDSALL: .. but it sort of perpetuates a lack of integration into the thinking about&#13;
     adjustment, the way these social programs are structured [inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
     WEBB: But it is part of the drive showing up in this explosion of social sector&#13;
     lending which Preston now wants to accomplish [both speaking at once]&#13;
&#13;
     BIRDSALL: Yeah, I think that the whole reaction to the pressure is--well,&#13;
     {inaudible] so it's in the speeches.&#13;
&#13;
     WEBB: This has been terrifically helpful.&#13;
&#13;
