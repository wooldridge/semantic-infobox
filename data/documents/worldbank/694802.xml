TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1    The Government of Russia (GOR) is committed to stabilizing and restructuring the national&#13;
economy. This commitment is reflected, inter alia, in the ongoing program of macro-economic and&#13;
structural reforms supported under the new Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy.  With the&#13;
achievement of a relatively stable macro-economic environment, the focus of the reforms is shifting&#13;
towards structural adjustment of the economy to market conditions which will ultimately help to re-start&#13;
the economic growth.&#13;
1.2    This re-start requires foremostly higher mobility of all factors of production, which are heavily&#13;
concentrated in the organized enterprise sector, with its some 25,000 medium and large enterprises.&#13;
This makes enterprise reform a high priority.&#13;
1.3    Enterprise reform  of such a scope lacks several key ingredients.  First, the gap in the&#13;
management skills between the Russian managers and their counterparts from the West, and even from&#13;
Eastern Europe, remains substantial. Second, the absence of the relevant market infrastructure constrains&#13;
purchases of these skills to bridge this gap. Third, enterprises, privatized with no capital input under&#13;
mass privatization, have no means to cover the inherent costs of restructuring. In its tum, slow progress&#13;
in restructuring impedes enterprises' access to financial markets and further deepens the aforementioned&#13;
financial and managerial gaps.&#13;
1.4    While some enterprises have started to search for restructuring expertise in the market, the&#13;
majority continues to adjust through accumulation of arrears to state, labor and suppliers. Responding to&#13;
the need of catalyzing restructuring process, the GOR has developed an Enterprise Reform Strategy to&#13;
accelerate enterprise reform at micro-level. The proposed Project will support further elaboration and&#13;
implementation of the Strategy as it will provide a broad range of corporate advisory services to help&#13;
enterprises restore their economic viability and gain access to market sources of enterprise finance. The&#13;
project would also broaden the institutional base of restructuring by involving in this process enterprises,&#13;
banks, potential investors, local consultants, and develop a substantial number of prototype restructuring&#13;
cases to help the GOR further elaborate its Enterprise Reform Strategy.&#13;
&#13;

2. SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
A.    OUTPUT DECLINE AND RESTRUCTURING&#13;
2.1    Russian industry2 has faced large adverse shocks since the breakup of the Soviet Union, both on&#13;
the demand and the supply sides. Federal and local government transfers, i.e. explicit subsidies and&#13;
cheap credits, have dropped significantly in real terms since 1992, imposing increasingly hard budget&#13;
constrains on the firms. As a result, the industrial output has fallen dramatically. As of September 1996,&#13;
it was roughly 40% of the 1990 level. Light industries, metallurgy, machine-building, chemicals, and&#13;
petro-chemicals sub-sectors have experienced the deepest declines. Sub-sectoral variations in output&#13;
performance are reflected in regional differences. The Central region and North Caucuses as well as the&#13;
largest cities, Moscow and St.-Petersburg, were among the most affected.&#13;
2.2    Enterprise adjustment was slow and so far mainly focused on reductions in working hours,&#13;
wages, and, to a much lesser extent, employment itself. While reduction of employment is starting to&#13;
accelerate gradually, in relation to the decline in output, firms still retain excess labor. Directors still tend&#13;
to preserve intact their labor force (and production) as indicated in a recent survey3 in which 46% of&#13;
directors stated this as their achievement. Employment bias is reinforced by the fact that unemployment&#13;
benefits present an inadequate fall-back option for dismissed workers, and firms tend to retain them but&#13;
adjust the hours worked and the monetary compensation. Firms also lack liquidity to provide separation&#13;
packages.&#13;
2.3    Updating the product mix and the development of production were listed as the major&#13;
achievements by only 10% of the directors. Very few of them listed as major achievements development&#13;
of new technology, increased competitiveness, improvement of quality, reorganization, entering new&#13;
markets, change of the production profile and new investment. This suggests that managers lack skills to&#13;
address these areas. Directors cited as main obstacles taxation, cost increases for production inputs,&#13;
customers' payment problems, low demand on the domestic market, obsolete equipment and technology.&#13;
In the short-term, they intend to respond to these problems through one or several of the following: cost-&#13;
reduction, price increase, advertisement, employment reductions, sale or lease of assets. In the longer&#13;
term, their focus will be on improving product quality, changing distribution and sales systems, attracting&#13;
foreign investors/partners, improving technology, reorganizing, changing their management systems.&#13;
B.     ENTERPRISE FINANCE&#13;
2.4    Government Transfers.  In 1994, some 25%  of the enterprises still received some form of&#13;
subsidy from the GOR, but the transfers have been declining in real terms, mostly been directed towards&#13;
very large firms, and related to a combination of employment-stabilizing objectives and compensatory&#13;
finance for the provision of social services. Enterprises also extract subsidies from the state through tax&#13;
2   The discussion of the enterprise sector in this report focuses primarily on the some 25,000 medium and large enterprises&#13;
that have been privatized since 1992 and which are the target group under the proposed project.&#13;
3   The survey of directors of medium and large privatized enterprises was carried out by the firms Interquest and Carana Corp&#13;
in March 1996 and funded by USAID. Its primary focus was to assess the demand for consulting and professional&#13;
services. The survey covered 350 enterprises in 19 oblasts, Moscow, and St. Petersburg.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

arrears, a widespread practice since 1995. In addition, they use wage arrears to lobby the GOR for&#13;
subsidies or tax concessions. In summary, while not all Russian enterprises face a full hard budget&#13;
constraint as yet, the typical medium to large enterprises are facing serious budget constraints and have&#13;
incentives to restructure.&#13;
2.5    Transacting Purchases and Sales. Working capital finance has become increasingly difficult to&#13;
obtain and severe payment problems have arisen. Enterprises, even efficient ones, have to transact their&#13;
sales through barter or offsets, often involving up to 10 intermediaries in a complex circle of barter-based&#13;
exchange, costing up to 10 percent of sales. Retail sales and exports are the main sources of ready cash.&#13;
Hence, there is little that enterprises can do, apart from better inventory management and choosing final&#13;
products that can be sold for cash. Payment problems of the GOR itself exacerbate this situation and&#13;
have contributed to the emergence of an illiquid and expensive system of tax offsets and bills of&#13;
exchange. Last, the banks are slow in making payments, partly because of an inadequate payment&#13;
system infrastructure and technology and partly because they make money on the float.&#13;
2.6    Financial Markets. Commercial lending activity is severely suppressed, as banks are presently&#13;
more interested in acquiring equities in blue chip companies and in investing in highly profitable treasury&#13;
bills and notes (GKOs and OFZs). The latter has created a serious crowding out issue for the private&#13;
sector. Although the interest rates on treasury bills and notes are expected to come down if the recent&#13;
sharp drop in inflation is sustained, the pace at which this will take place is uncertain. Banks are also&#13;
hesitant to expand lending activities to the enterprise sector because the non-performing portion on their&#13;
existing loan portfolios has increased as stabilization has taken hold, pointing to potential liquidity&#13;
problems and the risk of bank failures. Only few banks are systematically looking for lending&#13;
opportunities to enterprises. The domestic capital market for primary issues of equity and bonds is thin,&#13;
issues are impeded by lack of reliable accounts and problems with disclosure of company information,&#13;
and access to international financial markets is limited to a few natural resources exporters.&#13;
2.7    In order to obtain finance for working capital and investment, enterprises need either to generate&#13;
internal cash or to obtain access to financial markets. Restructuring of their businesses and achieving&#13;
sustainable performance is a key precondition for both.&#13;
C.    CORPORATE OWNERSHIP AND GOVERNANCE4&#13;
2.8    Corporate Ownership. Privatized firms are largely owned by insiders. About 60% of surveyed&#13;
companies were majority-owned by rank-and-file employees. However, workers are exerting little, if&#13;
any, influence over management, due to insufficient representation, lack of interest in corporate&#13;
governance and in monitoring their shareholdings. Managers own on average 17% of their company's&#13;
stock, a higher percentage than indicated in an earlier survey. This increase is being achieved by several&#13;
mechanisms, including purchase through investment tenders and cash auctions, stock buybacks, and&#13;
dilutive share issues.  The state is no longer a significant shareholder in most of the privatized&#13;
companies, holding on average about 9 percent of outstanding stock (as of end- 1995).&#13;
2.9    Private outside ownership has grown from 22 % at the end of 1993 to 31% at the end of 1995.&#13;
The pattern of outsider share ownership of Russian privatized enterprises is uneven, with outsiders&#13;
heavily concentrated in a few companies. More than two thirds of the companies surveyed had at least&#13;
4   The material in this section draws on the results of a survey carried out in late 1995 on behalf of the Russian Securities&#13;
Market Commission by Joseph Blasi, Rutgers University and Andrei Shleifer, Harvard University. The survey covered&#13;

one outsider blockholder, who typically owned 15% of a company's stock. About 11% of the companies&#13;
surveyed were majority owned by one or more blockholders. Most blockholders are Russian commercial&#13;
firns, followed by voucher investment funds. The table below illustrates a breakdown of outsider&#13;
ownership by types of owners.&#13;

2.10   Corporate Governance.  A presidential decree of end-1993 and the 1996 Law on Joint Stock&#13;
Companies mandate all companies with more than 1000 shareholders to use cumulative voting for the&#13;
election of board of directors. Since the spring of 1994, outsiders have been gradually added to boards of&#13;
directors. At the end of 1995, 75% of companies surveyed had at least one outsider director, up from&#13;
40%  in 1993.  The presence of a blockholder outsider shareholder tends to strengthen outsider&#13;
representation on the board: in companies without blockholders, 11% of board members were outsiders&#13;
as compared to 39% in companies with blockholders.&#13;
2.11   As a result of still inadequate board representation, many outsider owners are unable to influence&#13;
corporate decision-making. The board of directors of a typical company is composed of seven members:&#13;
four representatives of management, two representatives of outsider shareholders, and one representative&#13;
of state-owned shares, thus most corporate boards can still transact business without support of the&#13;
outsider board members. However, the survey also found that in 1995 about one third of all outsider&#13;
directors were added as a result of private negotiations with company management. This suggests, that&#13;
some of the outsider representation is secured by private arrangements rather than by forrnal legal&#13;
procedures.&#13;
2.12   A large proportion of surveyed directors do not comply with legal obligations to disclose&#13;
information to shareholders. The majority of the surveyed directors oppose disclosure of financial and&#13;
ownership information (68%  and 57%  respectively).  About 35%  oppose disclosure of business&#13;
information, including that about the product lines. The lack of information available to shareholders&#13;
undermines their meaningful participation in company management.&#13;

2.13   In summary, the survey rated 60% of the companies as having poor or very poor corporate&#13;
governance practices. About 39% received a good rating, meaning that they generally engage in positive&#13;
corporate governance practices. No companies in the survey received an excellent rating. The project&#13;
would aim to target as much as possible enterprises with reasonable corporate governance practices,&#13;
identifying them through the screening process, as well as engaging the outside shareholders in cost- and&#13;
risk-sharing of restructuring.&#13;
D.    ENTERPRISE DEMAND FOR RESTRUCTURING SERVICES&#13;
2.14   Priority areas in which consultants presently are and in the future are expected to be engaged by&#13;
the surveyed enterprises are taxation (25% of enterprises), technical and managerial training (19%),&#13;
organizing subsidiaries and departments (18%), enterprise valuation, share issue (18%), distribution&#13;
channels (16%), advertisement (16%), foreign partner search (17%), legal services (16%), capital&#13;
investments (16%), MIS (15%), audit and revisions (12%), packaging (13%), and business plans (15%).&#13;
Enterprises have specific views on what types of organizations rendering consulting services they would&#13;
entrust with projects in a number of specific areas, particularly when comparing Russian and foreign&#13;
consulting firms.  Russian consulting firms are seen to have a significant advantage in the areas of&#13;
financial matters and accounting (29% of surveyed enterprises versus 8% of surveyed enterprises,&#13;
respectively), legal services (29% vs 3%), relations with state bodies and main shareholders (19% vs&#13;
3%), and executive search and training (20% vs 13%). Foreign consultants come out ahead in the areas&#13;
of distribution technology (19% vs 13%), foreign economic activities (31% vs 11%), and engineering&#13;
services and design (17% vs 11%). Russian and foreign firms were more or less even in the areas of&#13;
production management, marketing and sales, and general enterprise management.&#13;
2.15   This structure of enterprise demand indicates that the TA needs of enterprises are complex and&#13;
diverse. Both western patterns of developing marketing, engineering, and production management and&#13;
local knowledge of the Russian institutional, accounting, taxation, and legal context must be brought to&#13;
bear. This will be addressed through a number of project approaches and activities, including: (i) project&#13;
promotion explaining the benefits and risks of engaging consultants; (ii) competitive procurement of&#13;
good quality consultants; (iii) teaming up foreign and local consultants in order to ensure adequate skills&#13;
mix for provision of relevant advisory services; (iv) selecting restructuring Sub-Projects which are&#13;
oriented towards delivery of tangible operational and financial benefits to BEs.&#13;
E.    SUPPLY OF RESTRUCTURING SERVICES: GENERAL OVERVIEW&#13;
2.16   The young consulting industry in Russia is represented by foreign and local firms, with almost&#13;
no joint-ventures. The leading international companies started to operate in Russia from 1990. Until&#13;
recently they dominated the market serving mainly "high-end of the market" clients.&#13;
2.17   Following the gradually growing demand of newly privatized enterprises for professional&#13;
services, medium-size foreign consulting firms and local consulting companies have started to emerge in&#13;
the market. Mainly, they are providing auditing services, gradually complementing them with numerous&#13;
other services as an ad hoc response to their clients' needs (e.g. clarifying the legal status and the&#13;
property rights, navigating firms through rapidly changing legislation, assisting with some corrective&#13;
actions and -- a popular service -- preparing "business plans" perceived by clients as bankable).&#13;
2.18   Several dozen medium-size foreign and Russian consulting firms, together with the leading&#13;
world consulting firms account for about 70 percent of the total consulting market in Russia, according&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
to the following ranking: (a)  the "big six"; (b) 20-50 medium-size foreign-owned consulting firms;&#13;
(c) 20-30 medium-to large-size (over 50 employees) locally-owned consulting firms; (d) unidentified&#13;
number (over a thousand) of small firms and individuals.&#13;
2.19   The "big six" are most visible in the market because (i) they have easier access to work with&#13;
international companies in Russia, leading banks, and the large export-oriented enterprises, i.e. the&#13;
clients interested in the consultants "brand name"; (ii) they win a substantial share of the donor-funded&#13;
contracts due to the lack of the domestic firms' prior experience to qualify under the international&#13;
procurement standards and resources to handle large-scope contracts.&#13;
2.20   Small and medium-size foreign consulting firms as a rule combine provision of general&#13;
management consulting services with auditing. Also, a large portion of their activities focus on&#13;
corporate finance, financial brokerage and search of an external strategic partner/investor.&#13;
2.21   There is a structural mismatch between the enterprise demand for professional services for&#13;
restructuring and the market supply. Large foreign consulting firms, able to cover all or many areas of&#13;
enterprises' needs, are not affordable to them, especially if the cost of their services is compared with the&#13;
production cost structure of a typical enterprise. Local firms have lower costs and better familiarity with&#13;
the Russian institutional context. However, the quality of their advice is uneven across the areas of&#13;
expertise and is difficult to verify. As a result, enterprises either do not hire consultants even if they need&#13;
them, or use their services in a piecemeal fashion, when advice is provided in isolation from the broad&#13;
picture of an enterprise's performance, and does not receive adequate follow ups. Hence, enterprises do&#13;
not reap full benefits from services, and are further discouraged from their systematic use. The proposed&#13;
project will address the mismatch between the demand and the supply by coaching enterprises through&#13;
restructuring process, teaming up foreign and local consultants, focusing enterprise restructuring efforts&#13;
on priority areas, and encouraging consistent implementation of the restructuring plans.&#13;
F.     DOMESTIC CONSULTING INDUSTRY&#13;
2.22   Regional distribution of the local consulting companies is extremely uneven, with 3/4 of the&#13;
registered and licensed "auditing"/consulting firms concentrated in Moscow and St. Petersburg. While&#13;
substantial, unestimated numbers of regional consulting firms exist in the provinces, data on them is not&#13;
available. Their self-identification will be an important project activity.&#13;
2.23   Similar to the "big six", Russian consultants have also started with auditing and accounting&#13;
services. In 1991-1993, these services were in particular demand, since each enterprise's privatization&#13;
plan had to include a so-called "enterprise valuation" certified by an auditing company. As of the end of&#13;
1996, there was still no clear specialization by types of services among local consulting firms, thus, their&#13;
self-identification as "auditing" companies could be misleading. In fact, they provide a substantially&#13;
wider range of services as illustrated in the Figure 2.1.&#13;

2.24   Although the spectrum  of additional services provided by firms who initially started as&#13;
4"auditing" companies is broad, these new services do not cover many of the essential areas of&#13;
restructuring, such as operational/ technological and engineering consulting, marketing and distribution&#13;
channels, financial management, organization of sales.&#13;
2.25   The above description of the local consulting firms explains the difficulties to classify them by&#13;
range/quality of the services provided. It may prove more useful to classify them according to their&#13;
origin, which has some correlation with the market segments they operate in. According to this criterion&#13;
the following three groups can be distinguished:&#13;
(a)    "Generalists". These are broad profile business consulting firms, which can be broken-&#13;
down into two sub-groups. The top twenty-twenty five of them have established&#13;
reputation in the market (see Table 2.2.) and operate county-wide. They are able to&#13;
deliver a wide range of often valuable services, yet they may not be able to address in-&#13;
depth some specific problems key to enterprises' turnaround. Nevertheless, these firms&#13;
usually have clear development strategies, are aware of their strengths and shortcomings,&#13;
and, accordingly, deliver services only when they are confident of their quality. In&#13;
striking contrast with this attitude, the second sub-group of "generalists" entails many&#13;
small firms or informal groups of individuals, usually associated with research/academic&#13;
establishments. They advertise themselves as "broad profile firms" but, in reality, they&#13;
gather ad hoc teams to respond to the clients' requests and deliver services of dubious&#13;
quality. Although, their self-identification is important, the proposed project will most&#13;
likely make use of the leading 50-80 local firms as primary contractors and sub-&#13;
contractors of the foreign service-providers.&#13;

(b)     Industry-Specitic Consulting Firms. Usually these are the spin-offs from  the (former)&#13;

Surveys demonstrate that enterprises are often keen to engage these firms as a source of&#13;
industry-specific expertise, while in areas of strategic consulting and financial&#13;
management the have no comparative advantages. These firms could be useful sub-&#13;
contractors of foreign consulting firms adding, for instance, knowledge of the Russian&#13;
industrial relations.&#13;
(c)     Consulting Firms Affiliated with LeadinsQ Financial Institutions.    The majority of the&#13;
latter (Menatep Group, Most Group, Uneximbank Group, Dialog Bank, Alpha Group,&#13;
etc.) include a consulting firm in their structure. These firms mainly service the group's&#13;
needs, executing, for instance, diagnostics and due-diligence for corporate takeovers.&#13;
The quality of their services is higher than those offered by industry-specific consulting&#13;
firms but, on average, lower than those provided by the top 15-20 broad-profile&#13;
consulting firms: lack of competition, and stable flow of unsolicited business from&#13;
within the Group are among the factors hindering their development.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
2.26   The above description of the consulting industry leads to the two main conclusions:&#13;
(a)    Only a few local firms can provide a wide range of quality services for restructuring.&#13;
Many of them provide services in certain areas with reasonable quality. Identification,&#13;
monitoring and classification of firms would substantially improve the market&#13;
information about the capacity of the local consulting industry to support restructuring&#13;
process, and, would also foster competition in this industry. To this end, the project will&#13;
develop a regular updated data base of domestic consulting firms, facilitate their&#13;
engagement in the Sub-Projects implementation, monitor their performance, and&#13;
disseminate relevant information to the market.&#13;
(b)    Both foreign and local consulting firm could gain substantial benefits from joint work:&#13;
local firms will upgrade their skills and develop expertise in new areas, foreign ones will&#13;
increase the relevance of their services in the Russian institutional context. The project&#13;
will encourage teaming of foreign and local firms through procurement arrangements,&#13;
however, it will carefully avoid any imposing of such arrangements, which might distort&#13;
the pricing of the consulting services provided.&#13;
&#13;

3. LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE AND THE BANK STRATEGY&#13;
A.    LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE&#13;
3.1    The Russian enterprise sector shares with other economies in transition features which influence&#13;
enterprise restructuring, such as the lack of enabling environment, weak market infrastructure for&#13;
restructuring and the absence of the market-oriented managerial skills. Experience of the Bank and of&#13;
bilaterally funded projects in Eastern Europe and Russia indicate several lessons presented below.&#13;
3.2    The Bank has assisted private enterprise restructuring in transitional economies almost&#13;
exclusively through "traditional financial intermediary lending".6 The Bank OED study attributes the&#13;
mixed success of such lending to, inter alia, the lack of attention to (i) the institutional arrangements&#13;
required for efficient decision-making of both the enterprises and the financial intermediaries; and (ii)&#13;
the technological, managerial, financial and labor needs of enterprises associated with mass privatization.&#13;
3.3    The ongoing First Private Sector Development Project in the Republic of Moldova (Ln 14555-&#13;
MD), and the Enterprise and Financial Sector Assistance Project in Lithuania (Ln 3866-LT) reinforce the&#13;
lines of credit to enterprises with restructuring TA provided on a partially cost-recovered basis. These&#13;
two projects have demonstrated so far that: (i) cost-sharing by participating enterprises improves their&#13;
incentives to restructure, introduces their demand-driven self-selection, and, contributes to higher rate of&#13;
successful turnarounds; (ii) local consultants' involvement facilitates transfer of skills to local private&#13;
sector and contributes to the development of the infant consulting industry.&#13;
3.4    It may be argued that due to the lack of the market information about the value of consulting&#13;
services, there may be little demand for the TA at-fll cost-recovery. The Private Investment and Export&#13;
Project in Bulgaria (Ln 3631 --BG), under which the Government on-lends Bank funds for TA to PFIs,&#13;
suggests the existence of effective demand from private sector in transition economies to borrow for TA.&#13;
3.5    The project incorporates also the lessons of restructuring programs in Russia, which fall into two&#13;
categories. First, in 1994-96 under the EU/TACIS, USAID and EBRD-funded programs, 54 enterprises&#13;
were restructured on a grant basis, and, second, under the Privatization Implementation Assistance Loan&#13;
(PIAL, Ln 3546-RU), 8 pilot restructuring cases are being funded on a loan basis since August, 1996.&#13;
Another 30 enterprises are in the pipeline for loan-based TA under the proposed Project.&#13;
3.6    The loan-based pilots have shown so far that (i) enterprises are willing to borrow for TA when&#13;
they are ensured of being coached through the restructuring process; (ii) they have strong preference for&#13;
a combination of domestic and foreign skills; (iii) a typical restructuring proposal combines elements of&#13;
diagnostics with intensive follow-ups in one or several of the following areas: (a) financial management&#13;
and cost reduction; (b) marketing and distribution technology; (c) organizational restructuring; (d)&#13;
personnel training. Outcomes of the loan-based pilots are not yet available.&#13;

Washington, DC: World Bank, forthcoming.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
3.7    Outcomes of 54 completed (of 73 total) grant-based pilots were evaluated 8-10 months after the&#13;
end of the sub-projects. The evaluation indicates that the sample benefited from the TA, though the&#13;
benefits vary by sub-sectors and by types of restructuring. Net financial gains, exceeding 5-8 times the&#13;
cost of the TA input and obtained within 2-6 months after the completion of a sub-project, were observed&#13;
in about 31% of the cases, mainly at enterprises in sub-sectors with a short business cycle, and where&#13;
"quick-fix" adjustments (financial, MIS, building marketing units) were carried out. Sustainability of&#13;
these benefits depends, ceteris paribus, on the enterprise's internalization of the new business practices.&#13;
About 38% of the sample enterprises undertook organizational, personnel management and&#13;
comprehensive marketing (developing new markets and identification new products) restructuring, with&#13;
longer on-site presence of consultants and a longer gestation period. This sub-sample has mainly&#13;
increased its capacity utilization and incremental sales growth (exceeding the cost of the TA input by&#13;
135% on average). The managers of this sub-sample confirmed that their strategic vision of the&#13;
company's development as well as the intrinsic quality of the organization have improved, which, in&#13;
their view, would translate in net financial gains in about 15-18 months after the end of the assignment.&#13;
However, it may be argued, that longer on-site presence of consultants helps the recipient to internalize&#13;
the new business practices, and, hence, the benefits would be more sustainable. In about 30% of the&#13;
remaining cases, the managers were either uncertain about the achieved results, or were concerned that&#13;
they may not be able to sustain the achieved level of performance after consultants' departure, and hence&#13;
would consider inviting them for follow-ups. These lessons, although important for the design of the&#13;
project, may not be totally relevant, since the grant-based TA was supply-driven and may not have been&#13;
fully owned by the recipients.&#13;
3.8    The above lessons were fully taken into account in the design of the proposed project, which&#13;
focuses on (i) demand-driven self-selection of enterprises committed to restructure, (ii) delivery of&#13;
result-oriented TA, fully-owned by enterprises; and (iii) high level involvement of the local consultants,&#13;
allowing for, inter alia, their longer on-site presence and more intensive follow-ups.&#13;
B.    THE BANK STRATEGY&#13;
3.9    The Russia Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) is scheduled to be discussed by the Board of&#13;
Executive Directors in June 1997. The proposed project is fully consistent with the objectives of the&#13;
CAS and with operational standards for project quality at entry. The CAS places high priority on taking&#13;
an integrated approach by the Bank Group to private investment financing, including developing an array&#13;
of policy advice, technical assistance and financial instruments to support high priority private sector&#13;
investments. The proposed project would address a key bottleneck in improving the environment for&#13;
private sector investment in enterprises undergoing restructuring, i.e.,  the need to develop and&#13;
implement realistic and high quality restructuring plans with the assistance of professional advisers. As&#13;
such, the project would complement and strengthen the overall effectiveness of Bank Group operations&#13;
in the area of private sector development.&#13;
3.10   The Bank is addressing impediments to enterprise reform and financial sector development&#13;
through a number of operations. The Privatization Implementation Assistance Loan (Ln 3546-RU)&#13;
provides assistance inter alia for (i) enterprise restructuring through the divestiture of enterprise&#13;
kindergartens; (ii) creation of collective investment vehicles (unit investment funds) as a source of&#13;
long-term enterprise finance and (iii) several pilot enterprise restructuring (paragraph 3.6). The Non-&#13;
Bank Financial Institutions Project (in the pipeline for FY 99) would focus primarily on insurance, and&#13;
possibly pension funds, creating additional channels for long-term finance for enterprises. The ongoing&#13;
Capital Market Development Project (Ln 4029-RU) helps to build the regulatory infrastructure for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
capital markets and supports the development of market architecture for securities registration, trading,&#13;
clearance and settlement. These are necessary for the efficient primary issue and secondary trading of&#13;
securities by the some 15,000 joint-stock companies that have emerged from the mass privatization&#13;
program. The ongoing Enterprise Support Project (Ln 3763-RU), co-financed with EBRD, provides a&#13;
line of credit to private commercial banks, through which private enterprises can obtain investment&#13;
finance. In parallel, the ongoing Financial Institutions Development Project (Ln 3734-RU), co-financed&#13;
with EBRD, helps to build up international-standard commercial banking capacity by accrediting and&#13;
providing information technology and twinning services to selected private commercial banks, including&#13;
those participating in the Enterprise Support Project. IFC has invested in (i) the National Registry&#13;
Company, a large-issue registrar, to stimulate, inter alia, improvements in registry services by providing&#13;
a world-class standard of performance; and (ii) several funds (Framlington, First NIS, and Volga) which,&#13;
inter alia, take equity and debt positions in privatized Russian enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    OBJECTIVES AND RATIONALE&#13;
4.1    Proiect Obiectives. The main objective is to develop a sustainable capacity in the Russian&#13;
private sector for market-based restructuring and, thus, promote enterprise reform in Russia, a process&#13;
presently constrained by a number of market failures and barriers as well as institutional constraints as&#13;
described below (paragraph 4.2). The project has three specific objectives: (i) to help about 250 private&#13;
enterprises improve their operational/financial performance, in general, and become bankable, in&#13;
particular; (ii) to strengthen the local consulting industry in this process and equip it to meet the&#13;
expected growing enterprise demand for business advisory services; and (iii) to broaden the institutional&#13;
base of the restructuring process and provide incentives to the key market agents, i.e. enterprise&#13;
managers, consultants, banks, institutional investors to initiate and drive the restructuring process.&#13;
4.2    Proiect Rationale rests on the need to promote enterprise reform at large, which is progressing&#13;
so far slowly due to the market failures and barriers to restructuring, as well as institutional constraints,&#13;
including:&#13;
(a)    Enterprises willing to restructure lack skills to do so and need to buy them in the market.&#13;
Asymmetry of information about the value of consulting services among the potential&#13;
users (enterprises) and the potential providers (consultants) hinders transactions between&#13;
the parties. While there is factual evidence of such transactions, they happen mainly&#13;
when buyers have means to assess the value of the services, often with the help of an&#13;
experienced outside owner. The project will reduce the asymmetry by introducing an&#13;
intermediary, the Russian Privatization Center (RPC), to coach enterprises through&#13;
selection and managing consultants. RPC will play this role temporarily and will work&#13;
with enterprises, banks, consultants to increase their role in the implementation, so that&#13;
the informational constraints in the market are gradually reduced.&#13;
(b)    The quality of local consulting services is falling short of enterprises' needs due to a lack&#13;
of know-how and capacity. The project will support the infant industry by facilitating&#13;
know-how transfer from foreign to local consultants through their teaming up under the&#13;
project.  An increased supply of efficient local consulting services, affordable to&#13;
enterprises at large, would strengthen the institutional base of the restructuring process.&#13;
(c)    Investments in enterprise sector are hindered, inter alia, by the lack of market&#13;
information about the value of privatized companies. Demand-driven, loan-based TA&#13;
implies self-selection of the BEs. Some eligible enterprises may be not committed to&#13;
restructuring, some others may not pass the screening, yet others may fail to obtain a&#13;
securing instrument for their Sub-Loans. Finally, the degree of success in restructuring&#13;
will vary among the BEs. In this process, direct and indirect signals will be sent to the&#13;
market about the value of, and the risks of lending to, over 1,000 eligible enterprises.&#13;
(d)    The lack of enterprise financing to cover restructuring costs is another clear barrier to&#13;
enterprise restructuring and, hence, productive growth. Such financing is not available in&#13;
the market because (i) banks do not lend for technical assistance, and (ii) new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
institutional owners (investment companies and funds) have limited resources and can&#13;
work with only a small number of enterprises. The project will provide loan-based&#13;
financial support to BEs.  Partial guarantees from the BEs' banks or institutional&#13;
shareholders will enhance this support and will help develop new institutional and&#13;
financial relationship for the ongoing market-based restructuring process.&#13;
(e)    The GOR is lacking a comprehensive enterprise reform strategy. The project will help&#13;
the GOR to test various specific approaches to enterprise restructuring and, hence, will&#13;
enhance the GOR understanding of the incentive framework conducive to enterprise&#13;
restructuring and will contribute to the Enterprise Reform Strategy, currently being&#13;
developed by the MOE.&#13;
B.    DESCRIPTION&#13;
4.3    The project will have one core and two supplementary components. The core, Restructuring&#13;
Services component will provide direct lending from the MOF to private enterprises to finance corporate&#13;
advisory services which will help enterprises to reveal their viable core of business, to improve one or&#13;
several areas of operations critical for re-starting growth and to obtain access to market sources of&#13;
enterprise finance. Its Ex-Post Evaluation sub-component will disseminate the project best practices in&#13;
order to maximize the project demonstration effect. The two supplementary components will enhance&#13;
the impact of the core one, i.e. (i) Restructuring Promotion component which will enhance the&#13;
understanding of enterprises, banks, potential investors of the restructuring process in general, and of the&#13;
opportunities provided by the project, in particular; and (ii) Market Information Improvement component&#13;
which will develop and disseminate a periodically updated Database of domestic consulting firms in&#13;
order to provide reliable information to the market about the range and quality of the available consulting&#13;
services and to facilitate teaming arrangements between foreign and domestic firms. systematic&#13;
information to the market about the range and quality of domestically available consulting services. The&#13;
Project Management wil l be carried out by the Russian Privatization Center (RPC) under the supervision&#13;
of an Inter-Ministerial Task Force to be established by the GOR.&#13;
Restructuring Services Component&#13;
4.4    Under this component, the MOF will provide Sub-Loans to eligible private enterprises to finance&#13;
restructuring Sub-Projects, implemented with the help of professional consultants, Sub-Projects will aim&#13;
at generating tangible operating and financial benefits to beneficiary enterprises (BEs) and will include&#13;
enterprise diagnostic followed by one or several clearly defined key areas of restructuring activities, such&#13;
as, e.g., improving accounting system, financial, information and human resources management,&#13;
marketing, reducing costs, streamlining corporate structure, etc. Preparation of "investment plans"&#13;
would be considered only as part of a well-structured package of assistance, demonstrating that as a&#13;
result of the preceding restructuring, the enterprise's "investment plan" would be, indeed, bankable.&#13;
4.5    The component will focus on helping enterprises to turn around their businesses through&#13;
revealing the enterprise's viable core and improving its performance so as to generate incremental&#13;
internal cash flow and/or obtain access to financial markets. The project will not introduce limits&#13;
(beyond those dictated by the credit risk considerations) on the Sub-Loans amount, however, large&#13;
enterprises willing to undertake comprehensive restructuring, would be advised to break restructuring&#13;
process in stages, and fund the respective Sub-Projects sequentially. The first five Sub-Projects and all&#13;
Sub-Projects amounting over $ 600,000 would be subject to prior Bank review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
4.6    The principles of enterprise participation in the project and the terms and conditions of sub-loans&#13;
have been confirmed with the GOR as follows:&#13;
(a)    Sub-Borrowers. Eligible sub-borrowers will be civilian enterprises (excluding oil and&#13;
gas extraction, military production, alcohol, tobacco, real estate and financial services),&#13;
at least 75% privately-owned, with employment between 400 and 10,000; legally and&#13;
effectively established as open JSCs, with clear corporate ownership, an independently&#13;
held registrar, in compliance with tax legislation and not natural monopolies.&#13;
(b)    Sub-Proiects.  Eligible Sub-Projects will be enterprise restructuring plans to be&#13;
implemented with the assistance of professional consultants, and focused on one (or a&#13;
combination ) of, inter alia, the following: (i) improving one or several areas of a BE's&#13;
activities, critical for overcoming its present distress; (ii) implementing a result-oriented&#13;
strategy of adjustments with relative quick pay-offs;  (iii)  implementing deeper&#13;
restructuring changes, if an enterprise has commitment and capacity to undertake them;&#13;
(iv) preparing bankable investment plans and helping the enterprises to raise financing.&#13;
(c)    Sub-Loans.&#13;
(i)    Sub-Loans will be made to enterprises to cover the cost of their restructuring&#13;
Sub-Projects, net of taxes; contribution of Sub-Borrowers will be equal to at&#13;
least 15 % of the Sub-Project's amount; Sub-Borrowers will also assume the&#13;
exchange rate risks.&#13;
(ii)    Sub-Loans (of an average estimated size of $ 300,000) will be denominated in&#13;
US dollars, will have maturity of four years, including one year of grace, and an&#13;
interest rate of 2 percent above the Bank adjustable lending rate to mitigate the&#13;
MOF financial risks.&#13;
(iii)   Sub-Loans will be generally secured by a bank guarantee to the MOF to cover&#13;
50% of the risk of loss of Sub-Loans' principal and interest. The MOF will&#13;
consider alternative securing instruments on a case-by-case basis.&#13;
4.7    Sub-Loans Pricing.  To promote participation, Sub-Loans will be priced slightly below the&#13;
market terms, in the range of 10.42 -- 12.42 percent per annum. This estimated end cost of borrowing to&#13;
enterprises will consist of:&#13;
(i)    the MOF on-lending rate (2% above the Bank lending rate for single-currency&#13;
US-denominated loans, which comprises 5.92 percent as of May, 1997);&#13;
(ii)    a market-priced guarantee fee, estimated at the equivalent of 2.0 - 3.5 percent of&#13;
the nominal Sub-Loan amount; and&#13;
(iii)   a market-priced marginal fee to a bank-guarantor to cover the cost of a sub-loan&#13;
administration (i.e., sub-loan book-keeping) estimated at the equivalent of about&#13;
0.5 - 1.0 percent of the nominal Sub-Loan amount.&#13;
4.8    Enterprise Demand for Financing under the Proiect. Enterprise demand for term-financing to&#13;
acquire restructuring TA has been assessed through a USAID-sponsored survey of privatized enterprises.&#13;
ERSP-specific on-lending arrangements and terms (paragraphs 4.6 - 4.7) have been tested through a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
survey of the FIDP banks and through pilot loan-based restructuring Sub-Projects funded under the&#13;
PIAL/PHRD. As of mid-May, 1997, eight pilots are in various stages of implementation; another 40&#13;
applications are in the pipeline of the forthcoming ERSP; 15 out of 18 surveyed banks are interested to&#13;
provide guarantees to BEs and would initiate applications from over 100 enterprises (for the first year&#13;
pipeline). About 20 interviewed investment and venture capital funds confirmed that they would initiate&#13;
restructuring of about another 3-8 BEs each. Detailed demand assessment is available on Project Files.&#13;
Quality of the enterprise sub-projects at entry is uneven: about half of applications requires substantial&#13;
additional input from RPC in order to be re-worked into quality Sub-Projects. Both quantitative and&#13;
qualitative considerations have been taken into account in the summary of enterprise demand estimates,&#13;
which are presented in Attachment 5 as a background work for the project cost estimates, including the&#13;
estimates for the operational budget of the ERSP Group at RPC. There is an upside potential in the&#13;
effective enterprise demand from (i) reaching larger number of market agents through the project&#13;
awareness campaign; (ii) improving the quality of enterprise proposals at entry through targeted&#13;
promotion workshops; and (iii) streamlining the Sub-Project cycle through a transition from a "retail" to&#13;
"wholesale" approach (as described in paragraphs 4.9 - 4. 10).&#13;
4.9    Sub-Proiect Cycle.  Sub-Projects will be generated through a variety of channels, involving&#13;
enterprises, consultants, banks and non-bank financial institutions (as enterprise shareholders), future&#13;
equity investors. Two base cases of Sub-Project preparation are envisaged:&#13;
(a)    "Retail" approach will apply, when enterprise requests the RPC/LPC help in selecting&#13;
and contracting consultants. In this case, an enterprise submits to RPC its application,&#13;
the draft TOR, and a pre-guarantee letter from a BG. RPC will evaluate this "partial"&#13;
Sub-Project proposal and upon its approval by the Evaluation Committee (see below)&#13;
will procure consultants in cooperation with an enterprise through standard short-listing.&#13;
(b)    "Wholesale" approach will apply, when enterprise selects the consultant from the Roster&#13;
of pre-qualified firms. The enterprise develops jointly with this firm a complete Sub-&#13;
Project (including application, detailed TOR, restructuring plan and its budget, draft&#13;
Sub-Loan agreement, a pre-guarantee letter) and submits it to RPC for review and&#13;
subsequent approval by the Evaluation Committee (EC).&#13;
4.10   Over the life of the project, the RPC will gradually phase out the "retail" approach in favor of the&#13;
"wholesale" one, which will open an "exit" strategy for the RPC by the end of the project.&#13;
4.11   Sub-Projects will be evaluated by RPC and approved by the EC based on the three groups of&#13;
criteria (Attachment 1) assessing, respectively: (a) the enterprise's current economic viability and its&#13;
restructuring potential; (b) the quality of the proposed restructuring plan; and (c) the financial proposal.&#13;
The Evaluation Committee will allow the GOR as a lender to participate in the on-lending decision-&#13;
making process. Upon a Sub-Project approval, RPC will (on behalf of the MOF) sign a corresponding&#13;
Sub-Loan Agreement (Attachment 2) with the BE, approve a Restructuring Services Contract&#13;
(Attachment 3) between the BE and the consultants and register the bank-guarantee.  Sub-Loans&#13;
Administration will be carried out, under the coordination of the RPC, by the banks-guarantors&#13;
acceptable to the MOF (30 banks as of mid-May, 1997). By virtue of providing 50% guarantees for sub-&#13;
loans, the banks will share the risks with the MOF, and, hence, will be the natural agents of the MOF to&#13;
administer sub-loans with due diligence.&#13;
4.12   Ex-Post Evaluation of Sub-Projects will include: (a) in-depth evaluation of the outcomes of a&#13;
representative sample (about 60) of the restructuring Sub-Projects; (b) preparation of restructuring case-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
studies and other training materials analyzing the lessons learned under the project; (c) dissemination of&#13;
these materials through training institutions/centers (indirect project beneficiaries) working with&#13;
enterprise sector; and (d) assistance to the MOE in monitoring the Project Performance Indicators. This&#13;
sub-component will be implemented by the Leontief Economic Research Center (LERC), a non-profit&#13;
municipal St. Petersburg organization, as designated by the MOE. Terms of Reference for this sub-&#13;
component are presented in Attachment 13.&#13;
Restructuring Promotion Component&#13;
4.13   This component will enforce the core, Restructuring Services component by familiarizing market&#13;
agents with restructuring approaches in general, and the project, in particular. Promotion activities will&#13;
drive demand for the corporate advisory services credit line, will help enterprises to improve the quality&#13;
of their proposals at entry and to use consultants more efficiently. The component will support:&#13;
(a)    broad marketing campaign which will market the Project through (i) media channels;&#13;
(ii) press-conferences in Moscow and in the regions; and (iii) distribution of the Project&#13;
information packages through the Local Privatization Centers  (LPCs), training&#13;
institutions and banks-guarantors. It will be delivered during the project implementation&#13;
start-up period. Its targeted output is informing as broad an audience as possible about&#13;
the opportunities provided by the Project and practical ways of participation.&#13;
(b)   targeted workshops which will be delivered to applying enterprises as well as to selected&#13;
training institutions/centers working with enterprises and local consultants. The&#13;
workshops will enhance the audience's understanding of the restructuring process,&#13;
further explain the Project design, the benefits and risks of engaging external consultants&#13;
in enterprise restructuring.  Their targeted output is improving the quality of the&#13;
enterprise applications at entry and facilitating work of the enterprises and consultants.&#13;
4.14    The component will be contracted out to a marketing and business development training firm&#13;
(see Attachment 11 for Terms of Reference), and will be completed over the first two project years. The&#13;
contractor will deliver the program through, inter alia, LPCs and existing enterprise-oriented training&#13;
centers, e.g., the EDI regional centers, Management Training Foundation, Morozov Business&#13;
Development Project, etc.&#13;
Market Information Improvement Component&#13;
4.15   Under this component two main activities are envisaged. First, RPC will develop a Roster of&#13;
pre-qualified foreign and local consulting firms to provide services under the Restructuring Services&#13;
component. The Roster will be advertised, updated annually, and made available to all interested parties.&#13;
Although the Roster is primarily a Project procurement tool, its availability to the market will improve&#13;
the market information about the sources of the quality consulting services and will help enterprises&#13;
(including those, not participating in the project) to select contractor for restructuring.&#13;
4.16   Second, interested local consulting firms (not meeting pre-qualification criteria) will be included&#13;
in a periodically updated Database, which will also be available to the market. The Database will&#13;
provide systematic information to all agents of the restructuring process about the Russian consulting&#13;
firms operating in the market, areas of their expertise and prior experience. The Database will be, in&#13;
particular, helpful to pre-qualified foreign contractors in assembling teams with skills mix relevant to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
individual restructuring cases by teaming up with Russian sub-contractors. Such teaming will also help&#13;
the local sub-contractors to upgrade their skills through "on-the-job training". Subsequently, it would&#13;
enable some or many of them to meet pre-qualification criteria during the Roster updates.&#13;
4.17   Establishment/updates of the Roster will be handled by RPC as part of its procurement duties&#13;
(see Attachment 4 for the Request for proposal (RFP) for pre-qualification issued in May 1997).&#13;
Database development will be contracted out to a private service provider (see Attachment 12 for the&#13;
Terms of Reference). The 1997 Database has been prepared by RPC and is already being used by&#13;
interested foreign consulting firm for preparation of their pre-qualification proposals.&#13;
C.    ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
4.18   Links to Country Assistance Strategv. The proposed project is consistent with the objectives of&#13;
the CAS and fits well into the Bank Group's portfolio: streamlining the corporate operations of the&#13;
privatized enterprises is a key precondition for access to private sector investments; catalyzing the&#13;
market for business advisory services by providing initial support for restructuring of some 250-270&#13;
enterprises would stimulate both the enterprise demand for restructuring services and their supply.&#13;
4.19   Background Work and Coordination with other TA Providers. The project builds on the lessons&#13;
of experience of restructuring programs supported by (i) EU/TACIS (1994-1995); (ii) USAID (1995-&#13;
1996); (iii) EBRD (1996-1997); and (iv) the Bank (PIAL, 1996-1997). The background work,&#13;
suggesting the need for the project and including two surveys of enterprise demand for consultants&#13;
(March, 1996), a study of the corporate ownership/governance (October 1996), a survey of Russian&#13;
commercial banks' interest in supporting restructuring by providing guarantees for TA sub-loans&#13;
(November 1996), have been largely financed by the USAID (with contribution from the Canadian Trust&#13;
Fund for the banks' survey). Project preparation is being largely funded by the USAID, which covered&#13;
RPC staffing and operating expenses in 1996-1997. Two key RPC project-related positions are funded,&#13;
respectively, by TACIS and the Government of Finland.  The project will be implemented in&#13;
coordination with two other donor-supported programs, i.e. (i) EU/TACIS program to be delivered&#13;
through the Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (about ECU 7 million); and (ii) British Know-&#13;
How Fund program to be delivered through several large Russian commercial banks (about 2.2 million&#13;
pounds).&#13;
4.20   Adequacy of Policy Environment for enterprise reform is addressed under the ongoing IMF&#13;
Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the proposed Structural Adjustment Loan (RU-PE-49203). The&#13;
policies supported under these operations include those improving the corporate governance of privatized&#13;
enterprises, transparency of privatization, accounting standards of enterprises, regulations for enterprises&#13;
bankruptcy/re-organization. A similar policy agenda is being pursued also under the GOR Enterprise&#13;
Reform Strategy developed by the MOE. Implementation of these programs will strengthen the&#13;
enterprises incentives to restructure and, hence, the project's impacts.&#13;
4.21   Public/Private Justification. The market failures and barriers for the broad-based restructuring,&#13;
described in paragraph 4.2 (i.e. the underdeveloped effective enterprise demand for professional&#13;
consulting services, the lack of quality supply response of the infant local consulting industry and the&#13;
absence of financing available to enterprises to cover the cost of external expertise required for&#13;
restructuring) justify public intervention in the form of a temporary initial financial support by the GOR&#13;
sector to purchase skills, services and training from private providers. Developing publicly supported&#13;
facilities to assist a large enterprise population to restructure, in an environment with a nascent&#13;
restructuring infrastructure, has been common since 1960s in many countries (e.g., India, Indonesia,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
Kenya, Argentina); and in virtually all East-European transitional economies. Public support of private&#13;
enterprise restructuring has also been provided in selected OECD countries in the 1970s, when&#13;
enterprises had to adjust on a mass scale to the new level of energy prices and, hence, to changes in the&#13;
cost of input and output. In Russia, presently, the state intervention is justified due to (i) the scope and&#13;
speed of restructuring required to re-start the economic growth; and (ii) the rudimentary market&#13;
infrastructure to support this process. Assistance under the proposed ERSP will be loan-based and will&#13;
be less concessional than in many other countries.&#13;
4.22   Cost-effectiveness.  The TA activities and outputs are clearly defined (see Attachment 9) and&#13;
include: (i) consultancies to about 250 private enterprises, (ii) about 20 case-studies and analytical&#13;
reports; (iii) about 20 restructuring promotion workshops; (iv) a trend of increased local consultants'&#13;
share in the corporate advisory services provided under the project. Although it is not possible to&#13;
estimate the monetary value of the provided TA, the latter will (i) allow the recipients to generate&#13;
additional internal cash flow and/or obtain access to financial markets within, on average, 10-12 months&#13;
after the completion of sub-projects; (ii) improve the quality and broaden the range of the services&#13;
provided by Russian consulting firms;  and (iii) better equip the Russian banks and investment&#13;
institutions to assess the risks of enterprise financing.&#13;
4.23   Sensitivity and Risk Analysis. Explicit discussion of the impact of project and non-project risks&#13;
on economic viability is provided in section VI "Benefits and Risks".&#13;
4.24   Fiscal Impact/Cost Recovery.  About US $75.0 million (88.2%  of the Bank loan) will be&#13;
provided as restructuring TA to BEs on a full cost-recovery basis. This TA will generate immediate&#13;
fiscal revenues paid by the service providers (about 15% of the total cost of Sub-Projects), which will&#13;
allow to offset the Project non-recovered costs totaling $ 8.4 million (i.e., the cost of the project&#13;
management and of the supplementary components). In the longer term, the Project will generate&#13;
incremental fiscal revenues through broadening the tax base of the restructured enterprises.&#13;
4.25   Performance Indicators. The project clearly defines its development impacts, which include: (i)&#13;
improved operating performance of at least 70% of the BEs (measured by substantial or full completion&#13;
of the restructuring TOR, and, respectively achieving one or a combination of the following goals: the&#13;
sales growth, cost-reduction, decrease of the share of barter in the turnover, improved liquidity, increased&#13;
tax payments, obtained access to market finance); (ii) building the capacity of the local consulting&#13;
industry (measured by the trend of the local consultants' participation in the contracts under the project);&#13;
(iii) accelerating the pace of enterprise reform by linking the Sub-Projects' outputs to the investment and&#13;
lending activities of the banks, equity investors, and the donor-supported lending/ investment programs&#13;
(see Attachment 9).&#13;
4.26   Proiect Sustainability. The project is designed as a temporary GOR intervention to initiate a&#13;
broad-based restructuring process in enterprise sector. It has explicit linkages with the GOR Enterprise&#13;
Reform Strategy, which requires privatized enterprises to, inter alia, improve transparency and&#13;
disclosure of their corporate ownership/governance, improve their accounting standards and management&#13;
information systems, reduce the share of barter trade in the turnover, etc. The project and the indicative&#13;
Enterprise Reform  Strategy would reinforce each other.  Broadening the institutional base of&#13;
restructuring and demonstrating restructuring benefits to enterprises at large (under the project) would&#13;
motivate them to undertake efforts to meet the requirements of the GOR Enterprise Reform Strategy,&#13;
while consistent implementation of the latter would help sustain the project's impacts. The Project&#13;
sustainability will also be enhanced by the direct participation of the leading Russian commercial banks&#13;
as guarantors. Over the life of the Project a growing number of commercial banks would be engaged in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
the project, which will help them to better understand the restructuring process and to influence pro-&#13;
actively the restructuring process of their client enterprises.&#13;
4.27   RPC will start to implement the project with a "retail" approach, i.e. coaching enterprises on a&#13;
case-by-case basis through all stages of identification, preparation and implementation of their Sub-&#13;
Projects. As the enterprises enhance their understanding of the restructuring and of the consultants' role&#13;
in this process, RPC will be moving to a "wholesale" approach, limiting its interventions only to several&#13;
critical junctures, i.e. evaluation and approval (jointly with the EC) of Sub-Projects prepared by market&#13;
agents. This will open an RPC "exit strategy". As the institutional base and market infrastructure of&#13;
restructuring are being developed over time, RPC will be increasingly involving market agents in the&#13;
implementation, i.e. encouraging bank-guarantors, corporate owners, future investors to supervise Sub-&#13;
Projects implementation and initiate restructuring of increasing numbers of enterprises. This strategy&#13;
will allow RPC to withdraw by the end of the project without damaging the sustainability of the launched&#13;
restructuring process.&#13;
D.    COST AND FINANCING&#13;
4.28   Cost Estimates. Detailed assumptions and estimates of the project cost and financing plan are&#13;
provided in Attachment 5. The total estimated project cost (Table 4.1) is US $ 100 million. The estimate is&#13;
based on the beginning- 1997 prices. Consulting services costs are derived from recent fees quoted for&#13;
similar services in Bank-financed projects in Russia. Price contingencies for consulting services cost (at a&#13;
level of 5% per annum on the basis of experience with similar TA projects in Russia) are estimated only for&#13;
the Restructuring Promotion, Market Information Improvement components, Ex-Post Evaluation sub-&#13;
component and for the ProjectManagement. The core, RestructuringServices component is a line of credit&#13;
with unknown number and size of individual Sub-Projects. Physical contingencies for the Project&#13;
Management Cost (at a level of 3.5% per annum) and price contingencies on physical contingencies ( 5%&#13;
per annum) are estimated based on the experience with the costs of the PIUs in Russia.&#13;
4.29   Financing Plan. The proceeds of the IBRD Loan of $85.0 million to the GOR will be used as&#13;
follows (Table 4.2): (i) US$ 75.0 million for Sub-Loans to BEs; (ii) US$ 6.4 million for the project&#13;
management cost (of which $ 6.1 million for the incremental operating cost of the ERSP Unit at&#13;
RPC/LPCs); (iii) US$ 2.0 million to fund the supplementary components; and (iv) US $ 1.6 million to&#13;
cover the price and physical contingencies.&#13;
4.30   The proposed Bank loan of an equivalent of US$ 85.0 million will finance 85.0% of the project&#13;
cost. Enterprises would co-finance restructuring Sub-Projects and contribute at least US $15.0 million&#13;
equivalent in local currency (15.0 %).&#13;

5. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    IMPLEMENTATION MANAGEMENT&#13;
5.1    The Government. The MOE (as the main counterpart for the Project) and the MOF (as the&#13;
lender to enterprises) will be the parties to the Implementation Agreement (IA) with RPC. An MOE-led&#13;
Inter-Ministerial Task Force (comprised of the representatives of the MOE, MOF, State Property&#13;
Committee (GKI), Federal Project Finance Center and RPC) will be steering project implementation and&#13;
resolving project-related issues at the GOR level. An Evaluation Committee (to be established by the&#13;
GOR with procedures and membership acceptable to the Bank) will be approving individual Sub-&#13;
Projects (paragraph 5.9).&#13;
5.2    Russian Privatization Center (RPC) as the Project implementation agency will act on the basis&#13;
of the Project Agreement with the Bank, and the IA with the MOE and MOF. RPC was established in&#13;
1992 as a non-profit, quasi-governmental foundation. It has developed a solid track record in managing&#13;
donor-supported enterprise restructuring programs (paragraph 4.19 above). In 1992-1996, RPC was&#13;
financed exclusively by donors. The donors' financing of the RPC is secured until at least the end of&#13;
1998, however in substantially smaller amounts than in previous years. After 1998, the donor funding&#13;
will most likely be phased out. To this end, the RPC has started to downsize, while at the same time&#13;
diversifying its medium-term strategy along the lines of: (a) performing the PIU functions for ongoing&#13;
and future donor programs; (b) providing technical assistance services to the GOR; and (c) building&#13;
revenue-generating activities under the subsidiary legal entity RPC-Consult.&#13;
5.3    The proposed Project intends to fully utilize the RPC unique capacity and skills mix in managing&#13;
projects in the area of enterprise restructuring. It will also help the RPC to implement its diversification&#13;
strategy by (i) imposing on RPC full accountability to the MOE and MOF under the Project, which will&#13;
strengthen the RPC rapport with the GOR; and (ii) by helping the RPC to further strengthen its&#13;
institutional capacity in enterprise reform, which will be increasingly in demand in the years to come.&#13;
5.4    Full RPC accountability to the GOR and the Bank under the Project will be ensured through a&#13;
clear delineation of the ERSP management functions from the rest of the RPC activities. RPC has&#13;
established and has started to staff a separate group for the ERSP (" the Group"). The Group will operate&#13;
according to the Terms of Reference acceptable to the Bank and the Task Force. Its personnel and&#13;
compensation policies will remain consistent with those of RPC at large.&#13;
5.5    The agreed with the GOR and RPC staffing plan of the Group for the first 15 months of&#13;
implementation includes: a Group Manager, 7 restructuring project managers ( including two long-term&#13;
consultants), 2 procurement officers, a lawyer, an accountant and 2 disbursement officers. Existing RPC&#13;
staff is adequate to launch the project (positions of 3 restructuring project managers are the only&#13;
vacancies in the above staffing plan). Staffing for ERSP Group for the life of the project is budgeted in&#13;
the estimated Project management cost (Attachment 5) agreed upon with the GOR.&#13;
5.6    The budgeting process and accounting procedures for the Group have been confirmed with the&#13;
GOR and the RPC during negotiations. Prior to September 30 of each Project year, the RPC will submit a&#13;
draft Group's budget for the subsequent budget year for the Bank review and approval, and prior to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
December I of each Project year, the MOF and the MOE will approve this budget. The RPC will&#13;
maintain the Group's accounting records in a form of a separate ledger of the RPC cash book.&#13;
5.7    The RPC project management function will be to:&#13;
(a)    coordinate the Sub-Project preparation cycle, solicit Sub-Project proposals from&#13;
enterprises, consultants, enterprise institutional shareholders and banks;&#13;
(b)    appraise the restructuring potential of applying enterprises and the quality of the Sub-&#13;
Projects, in accordance with the approved evaluation criteria (Attachment 1);&#13;
(c)    act as the technical secretariat to the Evaluation Committee (EC); upon approval of a&#13;
Sub-Project, finalize and sign on the MOF behalf the corresponding SLA with a BE,&#13;
approve the corresponding Restructuring Services Contract, register the bank-guarantee,&#13;
instruct the bank-guarantor to open and administer the sub-loan account;&#13;
(d)    monitor Sub-Projects' implementation directly and through its network of Local&#13;
Privatization Centers;&#13;
(e)    coordinate the sub-loans' administration executed by the banks-guarantors, and&#13;
undertake, on behalf of the MOF, timely measures to protect the MOF's creditor rights;&#13;
(f)    manage implementation of the Market Information Improvement, Restructuring&#13;
Promotion components and Ex-Post Evaluation sub-component; and&#13;
(g)    exercise customary PIU functions ( procurement, disbursement, reporting, etc.).&#13;
5.8    Local Privatization Centers (LPCs). RPC has a network of 9 Regional Centers, 6 of which have&#13;
each 2 -3 so-called "satellite" Local Privatization Centers. One project manager from each of the 9&#13;
Regional Centers will be involved in the ERSP at the beginning of the program, with a possible&#13;
subsequent expansion of the LPCs involvement. LPCs' functions will include:&#13;
(a)    direct identification of restructuring candidates and coaching them through the Sub-&#13;
Project cycle, i.e.: (i) assisting enterprises to prepare TOR, select and manage&#13;
consultants; (ii) exercising control over the utilization of the Sub-Loans in compliance&#13;
with the correspondent Restructuring Services Contracts and SLAs;&#13;
(b)    methodological and administrative assistance in implementation of the restructuring&#13;
promotion, market information improvement components with their focus on the&#13;
regional work; and&#13;
(c)    assistance to LERC in evaluating restructuring outcomes and in identifying suitable&#13;
regional training centers to disseminate the case-studies and training materials.&#13;
5.9    Evaluation Committee to approve Sub-Projects will be established by the GOR (with&#13;
composition and operating procedures acceptable to the Bank) to allow the MOE and the MOF to&#13;
exercise the GOR's oversight responsibilities. The EC will have five permanent members, including the&#13;
representatives of the MOE, MOF, RPC, the Board of the RPC Directors and an independent financial&#13;
adviser.  EC will conduct its meetings about once in a month to approve restructuring Sub-Projects,&#13;
prepared by RPC. EC's approval will be based on the same set of evaluation criteria which will be used&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
by RPC at pre-approval stage (Attachment 1). RPC shall notify other members of the EC of a&#13;
forthcoming meeting and furnish to them the meeting agenda at least 10 business days in advance. Upon&#13;
approval of a sub-project by the EC, RPC will conclude all relevant contracts for the Sub-project within a&#13;
period of 60 working days. If contracts are not concluded within this period, the RPC will have to&#13;
confirm the Evaluation Committee approval. Simple majority of votes will be required for Sub-Project&#13;
approval. Sub-Projects could also be approved in writing by a simple majority of EC members, in which&#13;
case a Sub-Project will be removed from the meeting's agenda. If a Sub-Project is rejected through&#13;
written objections, the RPC will leave the Sub-project on the agenda to allow the EC members to discuss&#13;
the Sub-project further and to arrive at a fully informed decision.&#13;
5.10   The Banks-Guarantors (BGs) will carry out sub-loans administration and will act as the MOF&#13;
agents with respect to sub-loans guaranteed by each of them. The cost of the sub-loans' administration&#13;
(market-based) will be included in the guarantee fee. The BGs will act on the basis of a framework&#13;
agreement with the RPC as the MOF's trustee. The sub-loan administration will entail:&#13;
(a)    keeping Sub-Loans accounts (one deposit account for the transfer of funds and one book-&#13;
keeping account off balance sheet) for each Sub-Loan, recording disbursement made by&#13;
the RPC to consultants, accumulated liabilities of a BE to the MOF and debt servicing;&#13;
(b)    providing periodical statements on the Sub-Loans' performance to BEs, RPC and the&#13;
MOF in order to allow the MOF (and RPC on its behalf) to exercise its creditor's rights,&#13;
follow up on enterprises in arrears and collect debt services by all legal means.&#13;
B.    IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE.&#13;
5.11   Implementation has been planned with the main objective of ensuring over time the RPC "exit&#13;
strategy" and allowing the market to sustain the initiated restructuring process. Three phases of&#13;
implementation are envisaged (Table 5.1). Project Implementation Plan is presented in Attachment 7.&#13;

C.   PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
5.12   The project will involve the Bank-finaiced procurement of services in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (January&#13;
1997). The proposed procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 5.2 below, and the time-table&#13;
for procurement activities is presented in the Project Procurement Plan (Attachment 6).&#13;
5.13   Enterprise Restructuring Services. For the Restructuring Services component a Roster of pre-&#13;
qualified consultants will be procured prior to Loan effectiveness (paragraph 7.2), and BEs will select&#13;
consultants from  the Roster through commercial practices.  In case of the RPC procurement of&#13;
consultants on behalf of the enterprises, the procedures for the Quality-and-Cost-Based selection method&#13;
will apply. The RPC started a two-stage pre-qualification process to select 25-40 foreign and local&#13;
consulting firms in February 1997. The first stage -- Expression of Interest -- was completed, with about&#13;
200 firmns having registered their expression to enter the Roster. Request for Proposals (RFP), issued to&#13;
all eligible firms in May 1997 (Attachment 4), indicates, inter alia, that (i) foreign firms are encouraged&#13;
to sub-contract local consultants (firms and individuals); and (ii) upon approval of a Sub-Project&#13;
prepared jointly by an enterprise and a consulting firm on the Roster, this firm would be invited to&#13;
negotiate a Restructuring Services Contract with this enterprise without additional competitive&#13;
procedures. An ad hoc Selection Commission, established by the MOE, will pre-qualify firms to form a&#13;
Roster on the basis of a "threshold", open-end approach. The firms will be pre-qualified based on the&#13;
evaluation of their technical capabilities.  They will also quote fees for the main categories of&#13;
consultants. This financial information will not be used for the purposes of pre-qualification, but in&#13;
order to make the quoted rates available to enterprises for selection and negotiation purposes.&#13;
Establishment of the Roster is a condition of Loan effectiveness (paragraph 7.2).&#13;
5.14    The end-users (enterprises) will solicit consultants' engagement in preparation and execution of&#13;
their restructuring sub-projects based on one proposal from a firm on a Roster for contracts valued at&#13;
$300,000 or less, and on at least two proposals for the contracts of greater value. In case the Roster does&#13;
not provide for appropriate restructuring skills for a particular enterprise, consultants for restructuring of&#13;
this enterprise would be procured by the enterprise and RPC through standard QCBS procedures. The&#13;
Restructuring Services Contract (Attachment 3) will include, inter alia, provisions that:&#13;
(a)    consultants could be recruited only at rates not exceeding those quoted during the pre-&#13;
qualification;&#13;
(b)    consultants would have an opportunity to extend the initial Restructuring Services&#13;
Contract, if and when (i) the enterprise decides that it needs consultants for additional&#13;
TA in other areas of enterprise restructuring; and (ii) this extension, i.e. the subsequent&#13;
restructuring application, is approved under the Project as a separate Sub-Loan;&#13;
(c)    consultants should not provide services to potentially competing enterprises, i.e. to more&#13;
than one enterprise in a same sub-sector, or should, at least, disclose to RPC and the&#13;
prospective client enterprise their prior engagement in the same sub-sector.&#13;
5.15   RPC will update the Roster annually through additional pre-qualification tenders. It is expected&#13;
that many local consulting firms acting initially as sub-contractors will later graduate from the Database&#13;
(developed under the Market Information Improvement component) to the Roster. The Database will be&#13;
available to the firms in Roster without obligations to select sub-contractors from this source.&#13;
&#13;

5.16   Ex-Post Evaluation. Leontief Economic Research Center (LERC), a non-profit municipal St.&#13;
Petersburg organization, has been designated by the GOR to implement this sub-component. The non-&#13;
competitive (Single-Source) selection of the LERC by the GOR is justified by the LERC's experience in&#13;
macro- and micro-economic analysis and policy research, as well as by the specific objectives of the sub-&#13;
component, i.e. to help the GOR to: (i) monitor the outcomes of the restructuring Sub-Projects and the&#13;
Project Performance Indicators; and (ii) to elaborate its Enterprise Reform Strategy.&#13;
5.17   Project Management. The RPC has been designated by the GOR as the Project implementing&#13;
agency. The two long-term consultants for the ERSP Group (positions of the investment specialist and&#13;
restructuring specialists) will be procured through the Selection of Individual Consultants method.&#13;
5.18   Bank Procurement Review.  Prior Bank review has been completed for the RFP for the pre-&#13;
qualification of consultants to enter the Roster. Prior Bank review will also be required for the:&#13;
(a)    evaluation reports for pre-qualification of consulting firms to enter the Roster;&#13;
(b)    Terms of Reference, short lists, evaluation reports and contracts for the Restructuring&#13;
Promotion and Market Information Improvement components;&#13;
(c)    Terms of Reference and contract for the Ex-post Evaluation sub-component;&#13;
(d)    Terms of Reference, evaluation reports and contracts with two long-term consultant&#13;
positions in ERSP Group at RPC; and&#13;
(e)    procurement for the first 5 Restructuring Services Contracts, and for Restructuring&#13;
Services Contracts with a value of $ 600,000 or greater.&#13;

D.    DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
5.19   The proceeds of the proposed Loan will be disbursed as follows:&#13;
(a)    Consulting Services: (exclusive of VAT): 100 percent of the cost of  consultants&#13;
including fees, international and domestic airfares, local ground transportation, hotel and&#13;
subsistence expenses, insurance, advertising (including media purchases), printing and&#13;
publishing and other head office cost. Disbursements will be made based on final&#13;
invoices, bills and other valid proofs of payments for service rendered, duly certified by&#13;
the enterprise or other beneficiary of services, and approved by RPC ( already net of&#13;
VAT). Unless otherwise agreed with RPC, all payments to consultants will be made to&#13;
the designated blocked account of a BE in its bank-guarantor, which will immediately&#13;
transfer these payments to the account of the service-provider;&#13;
(b)    RPC Management Expenses (exclusive of taxes): 100 percent of local staff salaries and&#13;
charges, individual consultants contracts, expenses for international and domestic travel,&#13;
local transportation, subsistence and accommodation, communication, office supply and&#13;
rental, translation, report writing, editing, printing, advertising, local and international&#13;
communication. Prior to the start of each budget year, RPC will prepare its operating&#13;
budget for coming year and submit it for approval to the MOF and the Bank. The budget&#13;
will include itemized categories of expenses, as described above and will be financed&#13;
through customary Special Accounts procedures (see paragraph 5.21).&#13;
5.20   The estimated disbursement schedule (Attachment 8) is based on the detailed Project cost&#13;
(Attachment 5), and on the disbursement profile for FILs in the ECA region and the Bank-wide TA&#13;
projects. The schedule does not take into account expected improvement in the capacities of the local&#13;
consultant industry, enterprises and other stakeholders to present to RPC viable restructuring Sub-&#13;
Projects ready for approval. Funds under the proposed Loan would be available for commitment until&#13;
June 30, 2,002, the proposed Project completion date. Disbursements would be completed by December&#13;
31, 2002, the proposed Project closing date.&#13;
5.21   Special Account To facilitate timely project implementation, the GOR would establish, maintain&#13;
and operate, under conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account (SA) in US dollars in a&#13;
competitively selected Russian commercial bank. The SA will be opened in the name of the RPC with&#13;
the initial allocation limited to US$ 1.5 million. When the aggregate disbursement under the Loan has&#13;
reached US$ 10.0 million, the initial allocation may be increased up to the authorized allocation of US$&#13;
3.0 million by submitting a relevant Application for Withdrawal. Replenishment applications should be&#13;
submitted at least every three months, and must include reconciled bank statements as well as other&#13;
appropriate supporting documents. Disbursements for expenses under contracts for goods and services&#13;
or individual items under US$ 300,000, and for all RPC operating expenses, will be made on the basis of&#13;
statements of expenditures (SOEs). This threshold corresponds to the expected minimal size of Sub-&#13;
Loans. Documentation for justification of withdrawals made under the SOEs will be retained by RPC for&#13;
ten years and will be reviewed by Bank supervision missions and audited annually by independent&#13;
auditors acceptable to the Bank. All other disbursements will be made on the basis of fully documented&#13;
applications from the Principal Loan account.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30-&#13;
E.    ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS&#13;
5.22   The BGs will open Sub-Loan Accounts (under the name of the MOF and the Enterprise) in their&#13;
books in order to (i) transfer payments to Enterprise's service-provider; and (ii) record the flow of funds&#13;
under each Sub-Loan, thus establishing legal validity of the enterprise debt to the MOF. Deposit Sub-&#13;
Loan account will be a purposely designated blocked sub-account of the enterprise current hard currency&#13;
account and will ensure protection of funds posted to this account against the seizure by a third party.&#13;
Book-keeping (off balance sheet) Sub-Loan account will reflect (i) payments to the consultant of a given&#13;
BE, (ii) accumulated interest and other charges; and (iii) BE's payments and repayments to the MOF.&#13;
Sub-Loan accounts will be reviewed in the normal course of the annual audit of the BGs.9 The BGs will&#13;
perform the Sub-Loan administration functions on the basis of framework agreements with RPC, and&#13;
will, inter alia, provide customary financial statements on the sub-loans' performance to the BEs, and the&#13;
RPC. The latter will be consolidating the statements, monitoring the overall MOF Project portfolio,&#13;
following up on enterprises in arrears, and notifying the MOF of the need to take any warranted legal&#13;
actions vis-a-vis enterprises in default.&#13;
5.23   The RPC will have responsibility for ensuring that appropriate financial accounts are maintained&#13;
for itself, the Leontief Center and BEs through the bank-guarantors. Accounts of RPC and Leontief&#13;
Center, including the SA and the SOEs, will be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to&#13;
the Bank. RPC will also ensure that Sub-Loan accounts in the books of the BGs are properly audited&#13;
annually by independent auditors acceptable to Bank. In the context of the overall audit of project&#13;
accounts and financial statements the RPC shall ensure that a representative sample of enterprises have&#13;
their financial statements and accounts audited.&#13;
5.24   The RPC and the Leontief Center will furnish to Bank certified copies of the aforementioned&#13;
audited accounts, together with the corresponding management letters, within six months of the end of&#13;
the fiscal year. RPC and the Center will submit to Bank quarterly and annually progress reports&#13;
(including financial and budgetary accounts) on all project component activities. The GOR and RPC&#13;
shall ensure that sufficient funds are earmarked to finance the cost of the audit of project accounts.&#13;
F.    SUPERVISION AND MONITORING&#13;
5.25   Supervision. The project supervision plan (Attachment 10) includes a schedule for Bank&#13;
supervision missions, the skill mix required, staff week input and cost. Three supervision missions are&#13;
planned for the FY98 and for FY99 each; two for FY00 and for FY 01 each, and one for FY 02. Total&#13;
staff input for supervision is estimated at 64 weeks of the Headquarters' and 48 weeks of the Resident&#13;
Mission's staff. A start-up mission is planned for July 1997 and a Project launch for September 1997.&#13;
A mid-term review is planned for April 1999. Progress reports will be submitted quarterly to Bank by the&#13;
RPC, as well as annual reports, summarizingthe progress and issues in implementation.&#13;
5.26   Mid-term Review of Implementation. The mid-term review of project implementation (planned&#13;
for April 1999) will, in particular, assess trends in the enterprise demand for the project, performance of&#13;
the already restructured enterprises, their servicing of the Sub-Loans, and the efficiency of the overall&#13;
implementing arrangements. It will also refine the RPC "exit" strategy. RPC will be responsible for the&#13;
coordination of the Mid-term Review and the follow-ups with the MOE and MOF. The basic reference&#13;
9   The banks-guarantors acceptabie to the MOF are leading commercial banks, most of whom also participate in&#13;
the FIDP. Their annual international audit is one of the mandatory requirement under the FIDP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
documents of this review will be the RPC Project Agreement, documentation under the ERSP operation,&#13;
other agreed Loan and Project documents and audit reports.&#13;
5.27   Implementation Completion Report. RPC will prepare an Implementation Completion Report&#13;
(ICR), the content and format of which to be agreed with Bank, and submit it to the Bank within six&#13;
months after the project closing date of December 31, 2002.&#13;
5.28   The Project's Monitorable Targets. Bank's monitoring of project performance will focus both on&#13;
quantitative and qualitative criteria of: (a) the progress in project implementation; (b) the achievement&#13;
of development objectives; and (c) the impact on restructured enterprises.&#13;
5.29   Implementation performance criteria will include: (i) the number of enterprises requesting and&#13;
receiving Sub-Loans under the project; (ii) the number of Sub-Projects implemented; (iv) the number of&#13;
enterprises restructured successfully; (v) amounts of sub-loans committed and disbursed by the RPC;&#13;
and (vi) level of participation by local consultant firms in project implementation, etc.&#13;
5.30   Development impact will be assessed through (i) improved operating performance of at least&#13;
70% of the BEs ( through evaluation of the sample group of enterprises as described below); (ii)&#13;
building the capacity in the local consulting industry (measured by the trend in the volume of project&#13;
contracts assigned to local consultants); (iii) an accelerated trend in the pace of restructuring (by linking&#13;
the Sub-Projects' outcomes to the investment and lending activities of banks and equity investors,&#13;
measured by the number of the restructured enterprises which have obtained access to new finance).&#13;
5.31   Impact on restructured enterprises will be assessed through monitoring a sample of about 60&#13;
BEs, with respect to their achievement of (a) general improvement of their performance (measured by&#13;
one or a combination of the following: improved liquidity, access to new finance, increased tax-&#13;
generation, decreased barter trade); and (b) Sub-Projects' specific objectives ( measured as full or&#13;
substantial completion of the restructuring TORs). The Project Implementations Plan and the Project&#13;
Performance Indicators are presented in, respectively, Attachments 7 and 9.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
6. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A.   BENEFITS&#13;
6.1    The project will help to implement some 250 restructuring Sub-Projects, targeting tangible&#13;
operational and/or financial improvements, which will generally (a) strengthen the medium-term&#13;
viability of the BE; (b) transfer to the BEs the skills of how to work with and use consulting services&#13;
successfully, which will serve them well for the future and (c) transfer market operation skills to&#13;
managers and staff in the specific context of their enterprise, which will maximize skill absorption.&#13;
6.2    All good quality Sub-Projects of eligible enterprises would be considered for funding under the&#13;
project. The project will not target only short-term tangible benefits. This may inappropriately rule out&#13;
significant number of enterprises, especially in sub-sectors with longer business cycle, restructuring of&#13;
which can bring net financial gains only in 15-18 months after the completion of a Sub-Project. The&#13;
main benefits for enterprises should be derived from internalizing sound business strategies and practices&#13;
rather than from targeting "quick-fix" improvements which may not be sustainable in the longer term, as&#13;
demonstrated by the lessons learned (paragraph 3.7).&#13;
6.3    The project would give, ceteris paribus, some priority to Sub-Projects which help enterprises to&#13;
meet the indicative targets of the GOR Enterprise Reform Strategy, i.e. to (i) improve the enterprises&#13;
accounting and financial management systems; (ii) introduce the MIS and help the BEs to decrease the&#13;
share of barter in the overall turnover; (iii) develop new markets and new relationship with customers;&#13;
(iv) open avenues of access to new capital investment. These changes, if supported by appropriate&#13;
assistance in internalizing their mechanisms (e.g. by envisaging personnel management training in the&#13;
Sub-Projects), tend to translate into net financial gains, 5-8 times exceeding the cost of the TA input,&#13;
within a period of 6-12 months, i.e. faster than, for example, organizational restructuring and developing&#13;
new production lines.&#13;
6.4    Besides the direct benefits to the BEs, there are indirect demonstration benefits which can accrue&#13;
to a much broader enterprise audience as well as to the enterprise corporate owners and potential&#13;
investors. The project targets these benefits through a systematic analysis and broad dissemination of the&#13;
restructuring experience gained through the sub-projects. Surveys demonstrate that enterprise managers&#13;
look to the experience of other enterprises when undertaking reform and considering to hire consultants.&#13;
6.5    Another benefit of the project is that it boosts both the demand for business advisory services in&#13;
Russia and the quality supply of them. The latter would be ensured by providing Russian consultants&#13;
with opportunities to participate in restructuring projects with international firms, and to gain the&#13;
experience, skill, clientele, and references needed to begin to effectively serve the huge Russian&#13;
enterprise sector. The project design, while staying within the Bank's procurement guidelines,&#13;
encourages enterprises and consulting firms to interact with each other during Sub-Project preparation&#13;
and contracting, in as much a market approximating manner as feasible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
B.     RISKS&#13;
6.6    The project faces macro-economic and institutional risks: a reversal of the recently achieved&#13;
stabilization and the inherent unpredictability of the Russian business regulatory environment may&#13;
exacerbate the difficulties that the enterprise sector faces, making it more difficult to undertake&#13;
successful restructuring. The project would suffer in several ways: first, demand would likely drop off;&#13;
second, successful implementation of sub-projects under way could be jeopardized; and third, most&#13;
importantly, the improvements under Sub-Projects may not be sustainable, thus putting the firm-level&#13;
benefits as well as Sub-Loan repayment at risk. The project cannot address this risk other than by&#13;
slowing down implementation or scaling back its scope, if necessary, and must therefore rely on the&#13;
stabilization policies of the Government, supported by policy lending from the Bank and the IMF.&#13;
6.7    The project also faces the risk, that even under favorable macro-economic conditions, the&#13;
intended sub-project benefits are either not achieved or are not sustainable, because of factors which are&#13;
not, or only partially under the control of the project and yet have a strong impact on enterprise&#13;
performance, e.g. ownership changes, corporate governance practices, corporate control behavior. The&#13;
project addresses this risk in two ways. First, enterprises have a strong self-interest to achieve and&#13;
sustain project benefits because of their financial exposure, both in terms of co-financing the&#13;
restructuring services, and with respect to their debt service obligation vis-A-vis the MOF. Second, sub-&#13;
projects have to be endorsed not only by management, but also by the enterprise board, ensuring broad&#13;
commitment to the sub-project, at least at entry.&#13;
6.8    The project further faces a portfolio risk: by definition, the participating enterprises will&#13;
generally have significant problems and could be a bad credit risk. Conceptually, the project cannot&#13;
eliminate this as it explicitly targets enterprises in need of restructuring. The project attempts, however,&#13;
to mitigate this risk by: (i) assigning great weight to turnaround potential when evaluating sub-projects;&#13;
and (ii) requiring that, as a rule, a bank guarantee be provided for 50% of the Sub-Loan amount.&#13;
6.9    Although demand has been tested (paragraph 4.8) and confirmed, it is possible, that the private&#13;
sector response to the project is inadequate. This risk is associated mainly with two factors: (i) the&#13;
trends in the interest market rates, determining the attractiveness of the Project financial terms and&#13;
conditions; and (ii) the failure on the part of some or many enterprises to comply with the necessity to&#13;
cover a part of the Sub-Projects' costs. The project addresses this risk in several ways: (i) the project&#13;
fills a market gap and its product is currently not available in the market place;  (ii) project&#13;
implementation will be accompanied by a promotion campaign; and (iii) the project is engaging&#13;
shareholders, banks, and consulting companies to identify suitable enterprises and generate Sub-Projects.&#13;
Finally, the project is calibrated very conservatively and aims to provide support to only about 25% of&#13;
enterprises of those, which are expected to be interested and eligible to participate.&#13;
6.10   The  project requires significant project management and  administration  expertise  and&#13;
collaboration among various private sector participants. The project addresses this implementation risk&#13;
in the following ways: (i) the implementing agency, the RPC, has a multi-year track record of managing&#13;
donor financed projects in privatization and enterprise reform, and will further strengthen its capacity&#13;
under the envisaged project implementation arrangements; (ii) project promotion will help the private&#13;
sector parties to better understand the project; and (iii) close monitoring of the RPC/LPC would ensure&#13;
timely practical assistance to the private sector parties involved.&#13;
&#13;

RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
ENTERPRISE RESTRUCTURING SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
SUB-PROJECT PREPARATION CYCLE&#13;
PROCEDURES FOR SUB-PROJECTS GENERATION,&#13;
EVALUATION AND APPROVAL&#13;
Definition of a Restructuring Sub-Proiect and its Financing.&#13;
I .    Sub-Project is an approved for implementation plan of restructuring activities to be carried out&#13;
jointly by an applying eligible enterprise and a pre-qualified consulting firm with an objective to improve&#13;
the enterprises operational and/or financial performance. Duration of a Sub-Project implementation may&#13;
vary from 4-6 weeks to 8-9 months depending on the nature of the restructuring activities which an&#13;
enterprise is willing to undertake. Engagement of the consultants is to be financed (in percentages to the&#13;
total Sub-Project cost) by a combination of an enterprises own resources (15-20%) and a Sub-Loan (80-&#13;
85%) provided by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) out of the proceeds of the World Bank Loan.&#13;
Generation of Sub-Proiects.&#13;
2.     Sub-Projects are generated by eligible enterprises and are prepared either with the help of the&#13;
RPC/LPC or jointly with a consulting firm, which will be expected to further implement the Sub-Project.&#13;
The enterprises and consultants are assured to receive assistance in the Sub-Project preparation from the&#13;
LPC of their region, and, if warranted, from the RPC Moscow.&#13;
3.    A supplementary channel of Sub-Projects generation is direct identification by the LPCs of the&#13;
enterprises seeking for restructuring, which are unable to clearly define their restructuring needs and,&#13;
accordingly, select a relevant consulting firm. In this case, an enterprise may submit its applications for&#13;
assistance under the project to the RPC/LPC, the latter will help the enterprise to finalize the Sub-Project&#13;
and upon its approval by the Evaluation Committee will procure the service-provider for the enterprise.&#13;
4.    In order to help enterprises and pre-qualified consulting firms to identify each other, the RPC&#13;
will ensure through the LPCs that enterprises seeking to restructure have free access to the Roster of&#13;
consulting firms pre-qualified as primary contractors, as well as to the Database of local consulting&#13;
firms. An enterprise may wish to engage a mix team of foreign and local consultants, and indicate this in&#13;
the TOR. In this case a pre-qualified firm from the Roster seeking engagement with an enterprise will&#13;
select a local sub-contractor using, if necessary the Database.&#13;
5.    After an enterprise has prepared the application and the draft of the TOR for restructuring, it will&#13;
invite proposals from at least two pre-qualified consulting firms ( for assignments greater than&#13;
$300,000), and select one of them. Consulting firms may also directly approach enterprises; in order to&#13;
maintain incentives for them to solicit their engagement and to work with an enterprise through the Sub-&#13;
Project preparation, the enterprise should invite the second proposal early enough in the preparation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Attachment 1&#13;
Page 2 out of 6&#13;
cycle, compare the two (or more) proposals and then, proceed with the development of a full-fledged&#13;
Sub-Project proposal with a consulting firm of its choice.&#13;
6.     While developing the Sub-Project proposal, the enterprise will need to determine the size of its&#13;
own contribution towards the cost of its Sub-Project and, respectively, the size of the requested Sub-&#13;
Loan. As a rule, an enterprise will be expected to obtain a bank guarantee or a similar instrument of&#13;
securing at least 50% of the amount of the future Sub-Loan principal and interest against a risk of loss of&#13;
the MOF from one of the banks acceptable to the MOF (currently 25 banks). The enterprise will seek to&#13;
obtain such instrument through direct negotiations with banks. The consulting firm, seeking engagement&#13;
with an enterprise (or the LPC) may help the enterprise in contacting an appropriate bank. In case the&#13;
enterprise has not been able to negotiate a bank guarantee, it still may submit the Sub-Project and seek&#13;
obtaining a corresponding Sub-Loan. Sub-Projects proposing provision of unsecured Sub-loans could be&#13;
approved by the Evaluation Committee on a case-by-case basis, if an enterprise proposes an alternative&#13;
securing instrument (e.g. liquid collateral, escrowing future revenues, etc.).&#13;
7.     The main objective of the joint development of the Sub-Project by an enterprise and a consulting&#13;
firm is to create the market approximating conditions for restructuring in order to develop the&#13;
enterprise's ownership of the Sub-Project, and to facilitate independent transactions between enterprises&#13;
and consulting firms. The enterprise and the consulting firm will be expected to complete preliminary,&#13;
"walk-in diagnostics" during the Sub-Project preparation, determine the enterprise's restructuring&#13;
priorities, establish working relations and, respectively, focus the Sub-Project on the implementation of&#13;
the essential restructuring changes rather than on the traditional diagnostic-oriented report-writing.&#13;
Submission of the complete Sub-Proiects to the RPC&#13;
8.    In case the enterprise and the consulting firm are jointly submitting a Sub-Project for the RPC&#13;
consideration, the Sub-Project dossier should contain the following essential elements:&#13;
(a)    an enterprise application (signed by the CEO and endorsed by the Board);&#13;
(b)    TOR for the proposed restructuring activities;&#13;
(c)    a second proposal from a pre-qualified consulting firm and the enterprise's justification&#13;
of its choice of the service-provider;&#13;
(d)    restructuring plan developed jointly with the selected service-provider, including clear&#13;
definition of:&#13;
(i)    the scope of work, the time-table and the expected outcomes;&#13;
(ii)   the proposed staffing plan and the budget;&#13;
(iii)  the proposed financing plan;&#13;
(e)    a draft Sub-Loan Agreement, indicating the amount of the requested Sub-Loan, and the&#13;
amortization schedule;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Attachment 1&#13;
Page 3 out of 6&#13;
(f)    a pre-guarantee letter for 50% of the requested Sub-Loan's principal and interest from&#13;
one of the acceptable to the MOF commercial banks.&#13;
Submission of Enterprise Applications.&#13;
9.    If an enterprise cannot submit a complete Sub-Project proposal, it may submit its application&#13;
supported by the draft TOR. In this case, the RPC will help the enterprise to develop the detailed TOR,&#13;
including the definition of the expected outcome and its impact on the enterprise performance, and&#13;
determine approximately the size of a Sub-Project and of a Sub-Loan, and will help the enterprise to&#13;

Enterprise Restructuring Services Project (ERSP)&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
for pre-qualification of consulting companies&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    The Enterprise Restructuring Services Project (ERSP) - see description in Annex I - is expected&#13;
to be financed by a World Bank Loan to the Government of Russia. The two main objectives of the&#13;
project are:&#13;
(a)   to restructure some 250-300 medium and large privatized enterprises which would&#13;
borrow funds (i.e. sign a sub-loan agreement) to pay for consulting services to undertake a&#13;
restructuring sub-project;&#13;
(b)   to catalyze the development of the Russian market for restructuring consulting services.&#13;
2.     The Russian Privatization Center (RPC) will be the Implementing Agency for the Loan and will&#13;
coordinate the preparation of sub-projects. The RPC will also evaluate and submit the sub-projects&#13;
together with a sub-loan request to the ERSP Evaluation Committee, as well as monitor the sub-projects&#13;
and manage the payments.&#13;
OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.     The objective of this procedure is to establish a Roster of consulting firms, pre-qualified to&#13;
provide consulting services under the ERSP sub-projects. The Terms of Reference describe the scope of&#13;
services required under the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Attachment 4&#13;
Page 6 out of 9&#13;
ROSTER OF PRE-QUALIFIED CONSULTING FIRMS&#13;
4.     Pre-qualified consulting firms will be registered in the Roster under the following specialization:&#13;
(a) General Business Management Consulting (including marketing, finance, tax and legal&#13;
advice, organizational restructuring, investor search),&#13;
(b) Information Technology,&#13;
(c) Human Resource Management,&#13;
(d) General Industrial Engineering Consulting (including environmental, energy efficiency,&#13;
process and quality control, production efficiency, material handling),&#13;
(e) Sector-specific Industrial Consulting (one sector only according to SIC code)&#13;
5.     The Roster will be used for recruitment of qualified consultants and for market-based selection&#13;
of sub-projects in the following cases:&#13;
1.     submission  of sub-project proposals prepared jointly by enterprises and&#13;
consultants;&#13;
2.     selection of consulting firms by potential beneficiary enterprises, with the&#13;
assistance of RPC.&#13;
6.     RPC and the enterprise will select the consultant in accordance with procedures acceptable to the&#13;
World Bank.&#13;
7.     The Roster will be made available to all the stake-holders of the ERSP Project as the source of&#13;
qualified main consultants2 for beneficiary enterprises to select consulting firms for their individual&#13;
restructuring contracts. The Roster will consequently include, and provide the following information&#13;
concerning the consulting firms:&#13;
-  short description of the firm;&#13;
-  main contact and address;&#13;
-  optional references (contact and address) of Russian enterprises with whom the firm has&#13;
worked in the past;&#13;
-  field(s) of expertise for which the consulting firm has been pre-qualified;&#13;
2Main consultant: will sign and take full responsibility for each sub-project under contract with the beneficiary enterprises. The&#13;
main consultant may use sub-consultants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Attachment 4&#13;
Page 7 out of 9&#13;
-  CVs of staff likely to participate in the ERSP Project;&#13;
8.    In order to ensure the continued availability of requisite technical expertise, and to guarantee&#13;
that consultant fees and charges remain within acceptable and predictable limits, the RPC will register&#13;
the fees and charges quoted in the Financial proposal in the letter confirming inclusion in the Roster. The&#13;
consultants will in turn sign separate individual contracts with the beneficiary enterprises for each&#13;
undertaken sub-project on the basis of registered fees and charges.&#13;
SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
Commitment of Consulting Firms&#13;
9.     The consulting firms to be included in the Roster commit themselves to guarantee the following:&#13;
1. the level of qualification, skills and experience of the consulting staff assigned to any sub-&#13;
project, based on the experts proposed as required for admission to the ERSP Roster;&#13;
2. the overall quality of the services to be provided, based on the methodology and generic&#13;
approach described below;&#13;
3. the daily fees for each category of expert staff assigned to any sub-project, as negotiated&#13;
with the RPC as a condition of registration in the Roster;&#13;
4. the level of travel and living expenses for consultants in Russia or abroad, negotiated with&#13;
the RPC.&#13;
10.    The pre-qualified consulting firms will have to demonstrate their ability to provide relevant&#13;
service to Russian enterprises in the Russian business and institutional context, and to this end are&#13;
encouraged to use Russian individual consultants or sub-contract local firms for each sub-project&#13;
implemented. To this end, a database of Russian consulting firms is available at RPC (at no cost to&#13;
users) as a source of reference for your company, who may not be familiar with the available source of&#13;
local consultant expertise. You are under no obligation to select sub-contractors from the database.&#13;
Restructuring Methodology and Approach&#13;
11.    For each targeted specialization, based on their previous experience, and on concrete examples,&#13;
the consulting firms are required to describe, in their proposal, the generic restructuring approach and&#13;
methodology they intend to use in each typical beneficiary enterprise. The key features and parameters&#13;
to be covered include the following:&#13;
*  description of a typical enterprise;&#13;
*  composition of typical team envisaged (use real CVs of current staff);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Attachment 4&#13;
Page 8 out of 9&#13;
*  critical path description of the restructuring process;&#13;
*  interface with the enterprise management;&#13;
*  head office support and supervision during implementation;&#13;
*  deliverables;&#13;
*  partnership and/sub-contracting arrangements with Russian firms (if applicable).&#13;
Generation of Sub-Project Proposals&#13;
12.    Once pre-qualified, the consulting firms will be encouraged and expected to prepare jointly with&#13;
the potential beneficiary enterprise specific sub-project proposals and submit them to RPC. The&#13;
beneficiary enterprise must obtain preliminary proposals from at least two different pre-qualified firms&#13;
from the ERSP Roster for restructuring services contracts of the amount above US$300,000. For&#13;
contracts of smaller amounts the beneficiary enterprise may obtain only one proposal. The selection&#13;
process for contracts for amounts exceeding US$300,000 will be undertaken by the enterprise itself,&#13;
taking into consideration quality of the preliminary proposal, practical experience of the firm and other&#13;
objective criteria. If necessary, RPC would provide assistance in the selection. The selected firm will&#13;
then further develop jointly with an enterprise a complete restructuring proposal (Sub-Project) to be&#13;
submitted to RPC.&#13;
13.    Following the above selection procedure (when applicable) carried out by the enterprise, the&#13;
sub-projects will be screened by the RPC in accordance with specified evaluation criteria for&#13;
consideration by the ERSP Evaluation Committee3.&#13;
14.    The consultants should indicate in their proposal the approach they will use to generate sub-&#13;
projects, which resources they will mobilize for this, and how this relates to their normal commercial&#13;
operations.&#13;
Supplementary information&#13;
15.    RPC will provide to the pre-qualified consulting firms comprehensive guidelines for preparation&#13;
and submission of sub-project proposals. A draft sub-loan agreement, general evaluation criteria for sub-&#13;
projects, and a draft contract for restructuring services will also be provided as additional background&#13;
and reference documentation.&#13;

Updating and Renewal of the Roster of Consultants&#13;
16.    Non-performing consultants, as defined below, will be excluded from the Roster and their name&#13;
deleted, following an annual review of the Roster. Will be considered non-performing the following&#13;
types of consultants:&#13;
-  Consultants that have performed poorly on previous ERSP sub-projects, as determined both&#13;
by the RPC and the beneficiary enterprise following a sub-project completion and&#13;
performance review;&#13;
-  Consultants that have failed to submit any winning proposals in the last 12 months, starting&#13;
one month after their registration;&#13;
-  Consultants that have submitted three consecutive sub-projects rejected by the RPC or the&#13;
Evaluation Committee.&#13;

RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
ENTERPRISE RESTRUCTURING SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
DETAILED PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
Estimation of Restructuring Demand&#13;
1.    Assumptions. Based on the demand assessment (Project Files), the RPC estimates that over&#13;
1,800 enterprises will be reached through Local Privatization Centers (LPCs), banks, investment funds,&#13;
financial groups, consulting firms, etc. Given the historic absence of consulting services in the country,&#13;
many of them may be not convinced of the benefits to be achieved. Some other may not meet the&#13;
eligibility criteria. Approximately 755 eligible enterprises would submit their Sub-Projects. A&#13;
systematic screening process, described below, would reduce this number to 253 approved Sub-Projects.&#13;
RPC Processing Activities&#13;
2.    Initial Contact. The 755 eligible enterprises will fill a detailed application form (available on&#13;
Files) prepared by the RPC. They will be contacted by a staff of the regional LPC and or a consulting&#13;
firm to discuss in detail with top management the enterprise restructuring needs and to verify the&#13;
eligibility criteria. It is expected that some enterprises will be unable either to clearly articulate their&#13;
restructuring needs, or to demonstrate commitment to implement restructuring plans consistently,&#13;
including possible painful measures (e.g., down sizing, closure of some production units). Some of them&#13;
would neither be able to select consultants competitively by themselves, nor willing to let the RPC to&#13;
procure consultants for them. This process is expected to reduce the number of eligible enterprises by 20&#13;
percent, thus leaving 604 enterprises whose requests would be further reviewed by the RPC.&#13;
3.    RPC Pre-screening. The 604 remaining companies would undergo a pre-screening process,&#13;
whereby Sub-Project proposals would be reviewed by the RPC and either accepted or rejected based on&#13;
the evaluation criteria (Attachment 1). Four hundred and thirty-six enterprises (436) are expected to&#13;
remain after eliminating 168 enterprises (i.e., 28%).&#13;
4.     Screening by Bank Guarantors. Sub-Projects would also be screened by Banks Guarantors.&#13;
Their due-diligence assessment is expected to eliminate further about 30 percent of applicants. This&#13;
would leave about 304 enterprises whose sub-projects would be fully appraised. Managers of these&#13;
companies would be invited to meet with the RPC to conduct a pre-loan review. This stage entails&#13;
decisions over the scope of work to be performed, the proposed work plan, detailed terms of reference&#13;
(TOR), proposed budget and expected outcomes (i.e., restructuring to be achieved and expected cash&#13;
flow generation). The result of this work would be a draft Sub-Loan Agreement (SLA).&#13;
5.    Evaluation Committee. The Evaluation Committee (EC) would make the final decision on&#13;
candidate Sub-Projects based on the same evaluation criteria (Attachment 1) and any other relevant&#13;
information. It is expected that the EC would reject about 17 % of Sub-projects and approve 253&#13;
contracts. The results of screening process are summarized in the table below.&#13;

6.    Contracts and Procurement. Upon approval of a Sub-Project by Evaluation Committee, the RPC&#13;
would help the enterprise to finalize contractual process. Based on experience gained from the donor-&#13;
funded programs, RPC estimates the average size of Sub-Loans at about US$ 300,000. With 253&#13;
enterprises participating in the ERSP, the sub-loan component of this project totals US$ 75 million.&#13;
7.    Monitoring. The RPC would monitor the contracted work between the enterprise and the&#13;
consultant. This would entail periodic site visits, correspondence reviews, activity records, consolidation&#13;
of statements on the Sub-Loan performance, etc.&#13;
Estimation of Budget of ERSP Unit in RPC&#13;
8.    Assumptions for the estimated Incremental Operating Expenditures of the ERSP Group at&#13;
RPC/LPCs (Table I) are based on actual RPC costs and staff input per category of preparatory and&#13;
monitoring activities, and other general and administrative overhead expenses per contract. Annual&#13;
expenditures vary according to the number of companies being considered. As agreed during project&#13;
preparation and negotiations, ERSP Group expenditures will be refinanced 100 percent by the IBRD.&#13;
Over the course of the four-year implementation of the ERSP, IBRD would refinance a total of US$ 6.2&#13;
million of the ERSP Group operating costs.&#13;
9.    Detailed assumptions for the cost break-down for the supplementary components are available&#13;
on Project Files and are not presented in this attachement ( per request of the GOR).&#13;

11.   Sub-Loan Disbursement. Payments made on consulting contracts and disbursements from the&#13;
IBRD Loan are presented in Table 11. Assumptions for contract implementation and invoicing by&#13;
consultant are also based on RPC's experience and practice. Restructuring activities are expected to last&#13;
12 months on average, and invoicing to continue through the fourth quarter, including the payment at&#13;
contract signing. It is estimated that payments from the RPC to the contracted consulting firms would&#13;
follow the schedule below:&#13;
Percentage of Contract Cost Paid&#13;
Payment 1           20% during I st qrter after signing&#13;
Payment 2           30% during 2nd qrter after signing&#13;
Payment 3           30% during 3rd qrter after signing&#13;
Payment 4           20%  12 months after signing&#13;
Average Contract (USD)*       300,000&#13;
12.   Estimated quarterly disbursements on all contracts and other components are detailed in Table II,&#13;
including operating expenses of RPC's ERSP Group, and supplementary components. Total anticipated&#13;
quarterly disbursements from the IBRD loan are shown along with the cumulative disbursements.&#13;

Cost Recovery Analysis&#13;
13.   Assuming a minimum default rate of 10 percent by sub-borrowers, repayments of sub-loan&#13;
principal and interest will start covering interest and commissions on the IBRD Loan less than two years&#13;
after start of project implementation. A the end of 18 months of project implementation the GOR will&#13;
thus generate a positive net cash-flow of US$ 295,000. This net positive cash-flow generation will be&#13;
maintained and increased from that point thanks to the five year grace period on principal repayment to&#13;
the IBRD. During the grace period sub-loan interests and principal repayments will exceed repayments&#13;
of interest and commissions to the IBRD, i.e., through year 5 after start of project implementation, thus&#13;
generating a cumulative positive cash-flow of US$ 27.2 million. As principal repayments to IBRD start&#13;
in year 6, the positive available cash-flow and sub-loan repayments would add up and continue to exceed&#13;
IBRD repayments through year 11 after start of project. As sub-loan repayments end around year 9 the&#13;
cumulative positive cash flow start to diminishing reaching a plateau at US$ 3.7 million in year 11.&#13;
Thereafter the cumulative cash-flow becomes negative through year 17.&#13;
14.   The GOR would therefore not only generate a substantial cash-flow from sub-loan repayments&#13;
but would also generate substantial fiscal revenue from the VAT paid by sub-borrowers on fees paid to&#13;
consultants during project implementation. Therefore, even taking into account the cost of the non-cost-&#13;
recovered components ( Restructuring Promotion, Market Information Improvement, Ex-Post Evaluation&#13;
and the cost of the Project Implementation) the project will be, at worse, fiscally neutral.&#13;

RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
ENTERPRISE RESTRUCTURING SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
RESTRUCTURING PROMOTION COMPONENT&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
Background&#13;
1. The Russian Federation (RF) in cooperation with the International Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development (hereinafter The World Bank) has prepared an&#13;
Enterprise Restructuring Services Project (ERSP) to be supported by the Bank Loan. The&#13;
project will support restructuring of some 250-300 medium and large privatized Russian&#13;
enterprises which would borrow funds from the Ministry of Finance to hire specialized&#13;
consulting services in enterprise restructuring. The Russian Privatization Center (RPC),&#13;
the designated Project Implementation Agency will manage the project implementation in&#13;
collaboration with the Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
2. The main Project objective is to develop a sustainable capacity in the Russian private&#13;
sector for market-based restructuring. In line with this, the project has three specific&#13;
objectives: (i) to help about 250 private enterprises improve their operational/financial&#13;
performance, in general, and become bankable, in particular; (ii) to strengthen the local&#13;
consulting industry in this process and equip it to meet the expected growing enterprise&#13;
demand for restructuring advisory services; and (iii) to broaden the institutional base of&#13;
the restructuring process by providing incentives to the key market agents, i.e. enterprise&#13;
managers, consultants, banks, institutional investors to initiate and drive the restructuring&#13;
process. The project will have one core and two supplementary components.&#13;
3. The core, Restructuring Services component will provide direct lending from the MOF to&#13;
private enterprises to finance the consultancies which will help enterprises to reveal their&#13;
viable core of business, improve one or several areas of operations critical for re-starting&#13;
growth and help obtain access to market sources for new capital. The two supplementary&#13;
components will enhance the impact of the core one, i.e. (i) Market Information&#13;
Improvement component will provide systematic information to the market about the&#13;
range and quality of domestically available consulting services; and (ii) Restructuring&#13;
Promotion component.&#13;
II.    Restructuring Promotion Component Objectives and Rationale&#13;
1. Obiectives. As the main objective of the ERSP is to develop a sustainable capacity in the&#13;
Russian private sector for market-based restructuring, the Restructuring Promotion (RP)&#13;
component will strengthen the core, Restructuring Services component by familiarizing&#13;
the market agents with restructuring approaches in general, and the project, in particular.&#13;
Its main goals are to increase the demand for the project, to better position eligible&#13;
enterprises to absorb the consulting services efficiently, as well as, possibly, trigger&#13;
independent transactions between enterprises and consultants in the market place. In line&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Attachment 11&#13;
Page 2 out of 6&#13;
with this, the project component is targeted to the following audiences: (i) managers and&#13;
owners of private enterprises who might want to improve their operational/financial&#13;
performance and make their enterprises bankable through restructuring; (ii) local&#13;
consulting companies already operating in the market who are supposed to gain practical&#13;
experience within the ERSP to respond growing enterprise demand for restructuring&#13;
advisory  services;  and  (iii)  senior  management  of  the  investment/lending&#13;
companies/banks, (iv) various international donor organizations active in Russia, to&#13;
whom the promotion activities under the component will provide general awareness of the&#13;
opportunities offered by the ERSP and specific terms and conditions for participation of&#13;
these entities and/or their sponsored enterprises. The component is also targeted to the&#13;
federal and regional government agencies and local authorities to enhance their&#13;
understanding of and thus create incentives for their initiating and supporting the&#13;
restructuring process at the regional/local level.&#13;
2. Project Component Rationale rests on the need to enhance key market players (enterprise&#13;
managers, consultants, banks, investors, government officials) understanding of the ERSP&#13;
and of the restructuring process in general, including:&#13;
(i) Along with the lack of financial and technical capacity to execute successful turnaround&#13;
of their companies, few enterprise managers and owners are aware of the role of&#13;
restructuring as the main tool of achieving financial and operational sustainability of&#13;
their enterprises due to informational gaps in the market. Within the framework of the&#13;
Restructuring Promotion component they will be exposed to: (I) the general description&#13;
of restructuring techniques as well as to best practice examples of successful company&#13;
turnarounds; (2) the comparative analysis of the availability and value of consulting&#13;
services (foreign and local) in general and within the framework of the RP component;&#13;
(3) the process of selection and management of external consultants; (4) the risks and&#13;
benefits of using external consultant services in general; (5) awareness of financial&#13;
sources/opportunities open for restructuring, including various donor-supported term-&#13;
financing and investment programs.&#13;
(ii)At present, local consulting market is unable to satisfy the growing needs for&#13;
restructuring consulting services due to the lack of capacity and know-how. The RP&#13;
component will serve the target of reducing these gaps through enhancing the local&#13;
consultants with better understanding of: (I) the advantages of teaming up with the&#13;
foreign consultants thus gaining access to know-how transfer through on-job training;&#13;
(2) the given opportunities to enforce the local consultants' services position in the&#13;
Russian market through improving the quality and broadening the range of services&#13;
provided.&#13;
(iii)Other important players in the market (banks, investors, government agencies) who are&#13;
interested in the revival of Russian enterprises as potential objects for investments, the&#13;
process hindered by many economic and political factors, will be enhanced with better&#13;
understanding of the role of restructuring in general as well with the knowledge of&#13;
transparent support scheme available under the project which prime objective is to&#13;
develop new institutional and financial relationship for the on-going market based&#13;
restructuring process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Attachment 11&#13;
Page 3 out of 6&#13;
The RP component implementation should also result in creating an increased   upside&#13;
potential in enterprise demand for restructuring consulting services.&#13;
III.   Component Outline: Scope of Contractor's Work/Services&#13;
1. The Restructuring Promotion Component is seen as an ongoing pipeline building exercise&#13;
and should include the following type of activities:&#13;
A. Delivery of broad marketing program promoting the restructuring in general and the&#13;
ERSP, in particular, aiming to reach as many potential key market players (enterprises,&#13;
consultants, banks, investment funds) as possible during the start-up period of the&#13;
project implementation. This public information campaign is also aimed to support the&#13;
successful implementation of the ERSP by informing the Russian public, government&#13;
officials, financial institutions, as well as international donors community. Thus, the&#13;
primary goal is to achieve maximum awareness outreach effect.&#13;
Broad Marketing Program should include:&#13;
* preparation, periodical update and dissemination of the ERSP information packages with&#13;
comprehensive description of the Project and procedures/benefits/risks of participation:&#13;
i) general description, financial terms, procurement organization;&#13;
ii) RPC/LPCs' coaching role and procedural requirement for participation;&#13;
iii)explanation of the guarantee arrangements;&#13;
iv) methodological guidelines on the preparation of a good-quality restructuring sub-&#13;
project proposals;&#13;
v) the rationale for undertaking restructuring efforts from the strategic corporate&#13;
perspectives of the enterprise;&#13;
vi) the benefits and risks of employment external consultants;&#13;
vii)the relevant GOR documents and policies promoting and supporting enterprise&#13;
reform;&#13;
viii)the list of the banks-guarantors acceptable to the MOF; and their local&#13;
representations;&#13;
ix) brief description of the existing donor-supported and GOR-supported programs,&#13;
projects and facilities, providing debt and equity financing to enterprises with the&#13;
indication of the key contacts;&#13;
x) other relevant information as mutually agreed by the RPC and the Contractor.&#13;
* press-conferences;&#13;
* preparation and publication of press releases and articles in the leading business and&#13;
economic newspapers and magazines;&#13;
* TV talk shows (to be prepared and place in the regional television in cooperation with an&#13;
appropriate media company to be identified by the Contractor);&#13;
B. Delivery of targeted short (2 days) awareness workshops which will enhance the&#13;
audience's understanding of the restructuring process and explain the Project design,&#13;
procedures for participation and the pros and contras of engaging external consultants in&#13;
enterprise restructuring. Workshops will be delivered in Moscow the groups of&#13;
consultants, participating banks' representatives and investment funds' staff. In the regions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Attachment 11&#13;
Page 4 out of 6&#13;
specifically the workshops will be targeted to the mixed audiences consisting of&#13;
enterprises (who are interested to apply or have already applied for participation in the&#13;
project), representatives of the banks involved in the project, as well as at local consultants&#13;
and training institutions/centers (indirect project beneficiaries) working with enterprises&#13;
and local consultants. Participation of regional/local government agencies is desirable.&#13;
Among main goals of these activities will be, inter alia, better positioning enterprises to&#13;
use consultants under the project in a most efficient fashion; disseminating the pilot&#13;
projects lessons learned (especially during the second year of the component&#13;
implementation), sharing successful and unsuccessful experience and allowing exchange&#13;
of ideas and experiences and active interaction of the main counterparts of the project.&#13;
Successful delivery of short awareness workshops will reinforce the broad marketing&#13;
campaign by the face-to-face interaction of the Project marketing team with the candidates for&#13;
the project participation. The workshops would, inter alia, include:&#13;
* along with information packages, development of a set of basic training (reading) materials&#13;
on the restructuring issues to be approved by the RPC;&#13;
* development of a comprehensive workshop programs customized to the needs and interests&#13;
of the specific audiences represented at each workshop with the emphasis, inter alia, on the&#13;
following topics:&#13;
(i) Restructuring as a necessary (though not sufficient) pre-condition for obtaining access to&#13;
productive investment:&#13;
* throughout the world restructuring is financed from the cash flow enterprises;&#13;
* in order to obtain financing for new investment through banks and/or the capital market&#13;
an enterprise should demonstrate at least one-two years of financially sustainable&#13;
performance;&#13;
* generally, especially in transitional economies, financially distressed enterprises have&#13;
internal capacity to release cashflow through various restructuring techniques (cost-&#13;
saving, downsizing, improvement of the assets performance, eliminating of wastes,&#13;
etc.).&#13;
(ii)General overview of turnaround methodology and techniques:&#13;
* objectives of the business restructuring;&#13;
* accounting and financial management restructuring;&#13;
* improvement of assets management;&#13;
* marketing management restructuring;&#13;
* manufacturing/operations management restructuring;&#13;
* engineering and R&amp;D management restructuring;&#13;
* people and organizational management restructuring.&#13;
(iii)Discussion of the availability of the in-house capacity for successful turnaround and the&#13;
lacking capacity to be outsourced;&#13;
(iv)Benefits and risks of external professionals engagement:&#13;
* the "re-inventing the wheel" argument;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Attachment 11&#13;

* benefiting from the cross-countries experience;&#13;
* risk of engaging the weak team and useful tips;&#13;
* necessity of managers' commitment to implement;&#13;
* what can and what cannot be expected from consultants;&#13;
development of the end-of-the workshop evaluation forms for the purpose of on-going&#13;
updating and upgrading of the workshops' effectiveness.&#13;
2. To increase the outcome of the RP component, prepare for the "exit" strategy and extend&#13;
its influence/outreach over the last two years of the ERSP:&#13;
(a) the subcontractor should deliver all the awareness/training workshops through a&#13;
network of existing training institutions having sound track record in business training&#13;
of enterprise managers, consultants, representatives of private financial institutions and&#13;
public agencies. It might be one training institution with the widespread network of&#13;
business training branches in the regions (for example, the Academy of Management&#13;
and the Market, Morozov project, with its Business Training Units in the regions), or a&#13;
number of local training institutions. Selection should be undertaken by the contractor&#13;
and approved by the RPC/LPCs. The list of the training institutions -- indirect&#13;
beneficiaries of the component -- will have to be approved by the RPC and the&#13;
Economic Development Institute of the World Bank ( Moscow Office);&#13;
(b)the availability of human resource capacity (qualified trainers able to pick up the&#13;
delivery of the restructuring training seminars and workshops on a commercial basis&#13;
after the component is terminated in two years) within the candidate training institution&#13;
should be the most important criteria during the selection process. Contractor should&#13;
provide an opportunity to the selected training institution(s) to train 1-3 local trainers in&#13;
each workshop/seminar. This would help to increase promotion dissemination effect&#13;
after the two-year RP component is expired.&#13;
3. In accordance with the component design its implementation will be tendered out to an&#13;
independent service provider, i.e. a private company with expertise in marketing, public&#13;
relations, business development training. The component will be implemented over the&#13;
first two years of the life of the ERSP. The Contractor will work in close coordination&#13;
with the RPC and under the methodological guidance of the Economic Development&#13;
Institute of the World Bank ( Moscow Office).&#13;
IV.   Implementation Schedule&#13;
Implementation schedule has been planned in accordance to the component's main&#13;
objectives to solicit effective quality demand for the project and enhance the understanding of&#13;
market agents about the restructuring process in general, and about selecting, contracting and&#13;
managing consultants. In compliance with these objectives it is phased in several periods which&#13;
differ in main strategic objectives, type and number of activities delivered and main outcomes&#13;
expected to be achieved.&#13;

(DATABASE)&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
I.    Background&#13;
1.1.   The Government of the Russian Federation in cooperation with the International Bank for&#13;
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD, hereinafter The World Bank) has prepared an Enterprise&#13;
Restructuring Services Project (ERSP) to be supported by a World Bank Loan to the Government of&#13;
Russia (GOR). This project will directly support restructuring of some 250-300 medium and large&#13;

RUSSIAN FEDERATION&#13;
ENTERPRISE RESTRUCTURING SERVICES PROJECT&#13;
EX-POST EVALUATION SUB-COMPONENT&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
I. Background&#13;
1. The Russian Federation (RF) in cooperation with the International Bank for Reconstruction and&#13;
Development (IBRD, hereinafter The World Bank) has prepared an Enterprise Restructuring&#13;
Services Project (ERSP) to be supported by the World Bank Loan to the Government of Russia&#13;
(GOR). This project will support restructuring of some 250-300 medium and large privatized&#13;
Russian enterprises which would borrow funds from the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to hire&#13;
specialized consulting services in enterprise restructuring.  The Russian Privatization Center&#13;
(RPC), the designated ERSP Project Implementation Unit, will manage the project implementation&#13;
in collaboration with the Ministry of Economy (MOE) and the MOF.&#13;
2. The main Project objective is to develop a sustainable capacity in the Russian private sector for&#13;
market-based restructuring through (i) helping about 250 private enterprises improve their&#13;
operational/financial performance, in general, and become bankable, in particular; (ii)&#13;
strengthening the local consulting industry in this process; and (iii) broadening the institutional&#13;
base of the restructuring process by providing incentives to the key market agents, i.e. enterprises,&#13;
consultants, banks, institutional investors to initiate and drive the restructuring process. The&#13;
project will have one core and two supplementary components.&#13;
3. The core, Restructuring Services component will provide direct lending from the MOF to private&#13;
enterprises to finance the consultancies which will help enterprises to reveal their viable core of&#13;
business, improve one or several areas of operations critical for re-starting growth and help obtain&#13;
access to market sources for new capital. The three supplementary components will enhance the&#13;
impact of the core one, i.e. (i) Market Information Improvement component will provide&#13;
systematic information to the market about the range and quality of domestically available&#13;
consulting services; (ii) Restructuring Promotion component will familiarize the market agents&#13;
with restructuring approaches in general, and the project, in particular. Its main goals are to&#13;
increase the demand for the project, to better position eligible enterprises to absorb the consulting&#13;
services efficiently, as well as, possibly, trigger independent transactions between enterprises and&#13;
consultants in the market place; and (iii) the Ex-post Evaluation component described in the&#13;
present Terms of Reference (TOR) and to be carried out by the Leontief Economic Research&#13;
Center (LERC), a non-profit municipal organization of St. Petersburg, as designated by the&#13;
Ministry of Economy and stipulated in the Project documents.&#13;

II. Objectives&#13;
The main objective of the present assignment is to better equip the Ministry of Economy to (a)&#13;
monitor the project implementation and the project performance indicators; and (b) analyze the&#13;
comparative advantages of different restructuring approaches tested under the project and to use this&#13;
analysis for developing further the Enterprise Reform Strategy.&#13;
III. The Scope of Work and the Input from the Implementing Agencies and Project Participants.&#13;
3.1   In line with the main objective, the specific main tasks of the assignment include:&#13;
1) Systematic general analysis of the outcome of all restructuring projects undertaken under ERSP. This&#13;
will be achieved through comparison of a limited number of ratios calculated for all enterprises&#13;
benefiting from ERSP and for a sample of about 60-80 comparable enterprises not receiving&#13;
assistance from consultants (control group) over the period of second half of 1998 - 2000;&#13;
2) Detailed in-depth analysis of the outcome of a limited number of restructuring cases, sampled from&#13;
the ERSP sub-projects, over the period 1998-2000, with a particular emphasis on the sub-projects'&#13;
sustainable impacts. Such an analysis will lead to the development of case studies that will be used to&#13;
disseminate the lessons learned under the ERSP project about the restructuring approaches, what has&#13;
worked what has not;&#13;
3) Preparation of annual analytical reports, summarizing the Project implementation progress, the policy&#13;
implications for the GOR, and the best restructuring practices and approaches;&#13;
4) Dissemination of the case-studies and the selected parts of the analytical reports through a network of&#13;
carefully selected institutes and training centers, which are working with enterprises and Russian&#13;
consulting companies with a view to demonstrating real benefits from restructuring consulting&#13;
services.&#13;

            Russia - Enterprise Restructuring Services Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Enterprise Restructuring Services
            Project will promote enterprise reform by facilitating the
            development of a sustainable capacity in the Russian private
            sector for market-based restructuring. The project has a
            core component enhanced by two small supplementary
            components: (1) Restructuring services, the main component,
            comprises a direct credit line of the Ministry of Finance to
            about 250-270 eligible private enterprises to improve their
            operations and to obtain new market-based financing. (2) The
            restructuring promotion component will reinforce the core
            component by soliciting demand, improving the quality of
            enterprise sub-projects, supporting a marketing program, and
            developing targeted short workshops. (3) The market
            information improvement component will finance the
            development and dissemination of a database of domestic
            consulting firms, which will reinforce the core component by
            facilitating teaming arrangements between foreign and
            domestic consulting firms and transfers of skills and
            know-how to domestic firms.
