            The East Asian financial crisis - fallout
            for private power projects
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The authors discuss the impact of the
            East Asian financial crisis on the power sectors of four of
            the most severely affected economies-Indonesia, Malaysia,
            the Philippines, and Thailand. For each country the authors
            examine the impact of the crisis on the cost of private
            power and the knock-on effects on retail tariffs. They also
            assess the sustainability of current private power programs,
            which hinges on the level of government risk exposure, the
            method used in awarding contracts, and the changed capacity
            needs in the wake of slowing or negative GDP growth.
