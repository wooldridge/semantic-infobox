&#13;
An estimated 10,000 people die from water-               In 1992 the WSP published the previous&#13;

developing countries and most of them are            millennium, designed to guide the WSP in its&#13;
poor. These deaths, and many more incidents of       renewed efforts to help boost service access.&#13;
sickness, are avoidable: they would not occur if     This strategy sharpens the WSP's focus, makes&#13;
all people had sustained access to safe drinking     its outputs more explicit, and establishes&#13;

The WSP began as a set of separate projects&#13;

appropriate technologies. It has evolved over        sector specialists to guide development efforts in&#13;
the years into a global partnership, active in       the water sector. Known as the Dublin-Rió&#13;
some 30 countries (see map on inside front           principles after international conferences in those&#13;

over two billion lack hygienic sanitation services.  · Water has an economic as well as a social value.&#13;
    Learning    What       Works     is   both   the&#13;

   Box 1 From Strategy to Pilot to Investment in Burkina Faso&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   In 1994 only one quarter of the residents of the city of Ouagadougou had appropriate&#13;
   sanitation facilities. WSP activities in the early 1990s led to the development of a strategy for&#13;
   wastewater and excreta disposal for Ouagadougou. The government adopted this strategy in&#13;
   1994, which in turn led to the design and implementation of two pilot projects in different&#13;
   areas of the city. The projects applied the basic characteristics of "strategic sanitation:" a&#13;
   demand-based approach offering an array of technological solutions and services, thus&#13;
   providing users with a choice of low-cost yet adaptable options. The approach included&#13;
   autonomous sanitation facilities, the promotion of appropriate technology, and the training of&#13;
   local artisans. These pilots, which benefited from substantial WSP support, demonstrated the&#13;
   feasibility of the principles outlined in the strategy developed with the WSP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   The pilot success influenced the design of an urban environment development program focusing&#13;
   on Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso (the two major cities in Burkina Faso), funded within the&#13;
   framework of the IDA Third Urban Project. The WSP assisted in preparation of the component&#13;
   and continues to provide strategic support to its implementation.&#13;

  and the PHAST methodology is now being adopted and adapted by WSP partners around the&#13;
  world.&#13;
  · The Participatory Learning and Action (PLA) Initiative builds on the results of two WSP-led&#13;
  initiatives: the PROWWESS program, which promoted women's participation in sector&#13;
  projects; and the Global Rural Water Supply and Sanitation Study, which found that projects&#13;
  that were more demand-responsive were more likely to be sustainable. The overall objective&#13;
  of the PLA Initiative is to increase the understanding of the links between gender, demand,&#13;
  and sustainability, and then help practitioners use this knowledge in more demand-&#13;
  responsive, gender-sensitive programs. This on-going study initiated by WSP is executed at&#13;
  the regional level, based on a common methodology and action plan.&#13;
  · The majority of the urban poor rely on informal systems for water and sanitation.&#13;
  Independent providers survive and often thrive without subsidies and usually without any&#13;
  long-term financing. They appear to fill a needed market niche, working in areas of great&#13;
  poverty where large utilities face serious barriers to entry. In 1998, the WSP initiated a&#13;
  program to learn about these small-scale independent providers and how they might be&#13;
  encouraged. The initiative is underway in the Andes and in Africa, in a joint effort between&#13;
  WSP headquarters and WSP regional offices.&#13;
  · Rural infrastructure programs often involve large donor investment into standardized&#13;
  technology, with maintenance provided by the state organizations initially, with plans to&#13;
  transfer this responsibility to the private sector. In many projects across the globe the&#13;
  mechanisms for the supply of goods and services to support the initial investment are not&#13;
  established. The objective of the new Supply Chains Initiative is to draw on the experience&#13;
  of the WSP and its partners to identify key issues and good practices and to stimulate&#13;
  learning in the area of the supply of goods and services for rural water and sanitation.&#13;

   Box 3 Networking at National and Global Levels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   In India, the IDA-financed rural water supply and sanitation Swajal project has been supported in&#13;
   its preparation and implementation by the WSP. The government of Uttar Pradesh agreed to a&#13;
   project design that included capital cost recovery for water services for the first time in India. The&#13;
   WSP's parallel signing of a strategic alliance with the Rajiv Gandhi National Drinking Water&#13;
   Mission, which is the federal body governing rural drinking water policy and budgets, assures the&#13;
   dissemination of lessons to key decisionmakers regarding this project and other WSP experiences.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   The innovations of the Swajal project were presented in the 1998 Community Water Supply&#13;
   and Sanitation Conference sponsored by the World Bank and the WSP. With five other main&#13;
   case studies from around the world demonstrating demand-responsive approaches to rural&#13;
   water and sanitation, the lessons of the Swajal project were presented to over 350 conference&#13;
   participants who represented a wide range of stakeholders, nationalities, institutions, donors,&#13;
   and professions. Participants included partners such as NGOs, members of the Water Supply&#13;
   and Sanitation Collaborative Council, and government officials. Another 30 case studies were&#13;
   presented in focused thematic sessions, allowing in-depth participative meetings on several&#13;
   specific topics such as innovative financing, hygiene and sanitation, decentralization,&#13;
   sequencing reform, and piloting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   The conference used a participatory design in order to maximize the effectiveness of the sessions&#13;
   and emphasize the networking value of the experience. The participants took advantage of the&#13;
   setting to connect with colleagues from around the world facing similar challenges.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   The WSP's network involvement and communication facilitation therefore allowed for project&#13;
   workers from countries like Bolivia and Ghana to hear of the experiences of stakeholders from&#13;
   the Swajal project as well as about the lessons learned from other experiences in Africa, Asia,&#13;
   and Latin America. The WSP continues to nurture, facilitate, and actively participate in&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
   Indonesia: The WSP made major inputs into the preparation, and is still supporting, the Water&#13;
   Supply and Sanitation Project for Lower Income Communities (WSSLIC). The first World Bank&#13;
   financed rural water supply and sanitation project in Indonesia, the WSSLIC took a&#13;
   decentralized approach involving extensive use of NGOs as intermediaries, and offers&#13;
   villagers' service level options based on their willingness to pay. This project was a forerunner&#13;
   of the Bank's adaptive lending arrangements, which allow projects the design flexibility to&#13;
   adapt to changing circumstances as lessons are learned during implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   Bolivia: The WSP-executed, Dutch-funded Yacupaj pilot project tested low-cost technologies,&#13;
   adopted innovative approaches to involving communities in decisions about services, and&#13;
   implemented an extensive health education program. The pilot paved the way for the IDA-&#13;
   assisted National Rural Water and Sanitation Project (PROSABAR) and for defining sector&#13;
   strategies and policies.&#13;

&#13;
   Ghana: The WSP supported the IDA-financed Community Water and Sanitation Project&#13;
   (CWSP), launched at a time when the country was undergoing considerable social and&#13;
   economic reform. While this generated challenges, it made the introduction of the new&#13;
   demand-responsive approach to water and sanitation acceptable to most small towns and rural&#13;
   communities. The project has been a success and the WSP is now assisting in the preparation&#13;

            Water and sanitation services for the poor
            : innovating through field experience program strategy - 1999-2003
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            An estimated 10,000 people die from
            water related diseases every day in a relentless global
            calamity. These people live predominantly in developing
            countries and most of them are poor. These deaths, and many
            more incidents of sickness, are avoidable: they would not
            occur if all people had sustained access to safe drinking
            water and sanitation services. Since 1978 the Water and
            Sanitation Program (WSP) has been working to help poor
            people gain access to these essential services. The WSP
            began as a set of separate projects supported by the United
            Nations Development Program (UNDP) and implemented by the
            World Bank to test and promote low-cost appropriate
            technologies. It has evolved over the years into a global
            partnership, active in some 30 countries, financially
            supported by multilateral and bilateral development
            agencies, and contributing to the struggle to improve water
            and sanitation access for the poor. This note presents an
            updated strategy for the new millennium, designed to guide
            the WSP in its renewed efforts to help boost service access.
            This strategy sharpens the WSP's focus, makes its
            outputs more explicit, and establishes standards for more
            consistent product quality. The thrust of this new strategy
            is to step up the WSP's impact by stretching and
            leveraging its limited resources.
