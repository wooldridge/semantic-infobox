Standard Provisions&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Arrangements between&#13;
the Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
1.    Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1   The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in this&#13;
Administration Arrangement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;
under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Arrangement shall be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Arrangement or any&#13;
applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2   Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time,&#13;
including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to&#13;
prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources&#13;
to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of&#13;
the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donors&#13;
acknowledge that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist&#13;
financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual member country&#13;
that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be&#13;
kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be&#13;
commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee, has&#13;
legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States Dollars (the&#13;
"Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3    Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their respective&#13;
Administration Arrangements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency other than the&#13;
Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions,&#13;
the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank&#13;
on the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of&#13;
exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any&#13;
additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies&#13;
as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the&#13;
conversion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿7 of 10&#13;
2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of trust&#13;
funds administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment to the Trust Fund&#13;
to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
3.     Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1    The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each Installment, an&#13;
amount equal to two percent (2%) per Installment as an administrative fee for the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2   In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for program management and&#13;
Trust Fund administration, that are: (i) not covered by the percentage deduction specified above as an&#13;
administrative fee; and (ii) not included under Annex 1 of the Administration Arrangements in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures shall be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis&#13;
up to a maximum of seven point zero six percent (7.06%) of the total Contributions under all&#13;
Administration Arrangements.&#13;
3.3    Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust Fund&#13;
Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual Contributions&#13;
significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first Administration&#13;
Arrangement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the&#13;
right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be&#13;
effectuated by amendments made to the Administration Arrangements of all Donors and which would&#13;
thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement&#13;
existing Administration Arrangements or from new Donors under new Administration Arrangements.&#13;

external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether such an&#13;
external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope and terms of&#13;
reference of such audit. Following arrangement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank shall&#13;

conduct of such review or evaluation, and the Bank shall provide all relevant information within the limits&#13;
of the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including any costs incurred by&#13;
the Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation will not&#13;
