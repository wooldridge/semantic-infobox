&#13;
          pattern when an IDA credit was made for the first education&#13;
&#13;
          project in 1966.   In the last two years, this tendency&#13;
&#13;
          toward a hroadening of our operations has become much more&#13;
&#13;
          pronounced.   Nhile continuing operations in our traditional&#13;
&#13;
          fields, we have begun a major effort in agriculture, and&#13;
&#13;
          within agriculture we are trying several different approaches.&#13;
&#13;
                     We have already made one credit for a comprehensive&#13;
&#13;
          program to support smallholder peasant agriculture in&#13;
&#13;
          Southern Ethiopia and another for larger scale, commercial&#13;
&#13;
          dry farming in North\o!estern Ethiopia.   We hope to present for&#13;
&#13;
          your consideration in the near future two more agricultural&#13;
&#13;
          projects -- one for dairy development and one for improvement&#13;
&#13;
         of coffee processing.&#13;
&#13;
                     Farther down the pipeline, we have an irrigation&#13;
&#13;
          project under consideration.   Outside of agriculture, we plan&#13;
&#13;
          to make another new departure \Â·d th a water supply and se\\rerage&#13;
&#13;
          project.&#13;
&#13;
                     I might add that our broadening pattern of activitie&#13;
&#13;
          is not only reflected in the diversification of our lending&#13;
&#13;
          efforts.   For instance, we are considering a oroposal to provi e&#13;
&#13;
          assistance in revising Ethiopian Customs tariff, and we have&#13;
&#13;
          organized a Consultative Group with the first meeting schedule&#13;
&#13;
          to take place in May.&#13;
&amp;#12;STRICTLY   ONFIDENTIAL                                                               36&#13;

                       \â&#128;¢Jhile   tÂ¥e   have been getting more deeply involved, a&#13;
&#13;
           growing awareness and concern \oli th economic and financial&#13;
&#13;
           matters has become apparent on the Ethiopian side, as the&#13;
&#13;
           Government has tried to diagnose the nroblems facing it and&#13;
&#13;
            find solutions.       This positjve attitude was clearlv&#13;
&#13;
           demonstrated in the comprehensive and constructive discussions&#13;
&#13;
           on the Bank's draft Economic Report which took place bebrecn&#13;
&#13;
           senior government officials and Bank staff last summer.&#13;
&#13;
                       Turning nm.,r to the Second Education Project which&#13;
&#13;
           is before you today, it may he considered in the context of on&#13;
&#13;
           of those major problems which the Government has identified&#13;
&#13;
           and is making strong efforts to solve.                 The Government has&#13;
&#13;
           rightly recognized that lack of trained manpower is one of the&#13;
&#13;
           ~in     constraints to Ethiopia's economic growth.              At the same&#13;
&#13;
            time there is great popular pressure for educational&#13;
&#13;
           opportunities.        Thus, there is a tremendous urge to catch up,&#13;
&#13;
           both on the part of the Government and the populace.                 In&#13;
&#13;
            this atmosphere, it is extremely difficult to turn students&#13;
&#13;
           away, and this has led to severe overcrowding in many schools.&#13;
&#13;
                        The original request included provision for many&#13;
&#13;
           more student places than are provided in the project hefore&#13;
&#13;
            you.    In its present form the project reconciles the desire&#13;
&#13;
            for very rapid expansion         ~,ori th   the need to adapt the e ducation&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             system to the country's development requirements.                In essence,&#13;
&#13;
             it is a holding operation, including only the most urgent&#13;
&#13;
             necessities, pending the completion of the manpower studies&#13;
&#13;
             and the sector survey which will provide the basis for a&#13;
&#13;
             sound, long-term, education investment program..&#13;
&#13;
                       If all goes well, we may expect two or three years&#13;
&#13;
             from now to consider a major project to develop Etl1iopia's&#13;
&#13;
             new education system.&#13;
&#13;
                       Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
                       MR. McNAMARA:     Thank you, sir.&#13;
&#13;
                       Gentlemen, may I have your comments or questions?&#13;
&#13;
                       (No response.)&#13;
&#13;
                       I see we are all following the suggestion of some&#13;
&#13;
             of you that silence means assent.       I am sure that that must&#13;
&#13;
             be the way to interpret your silence on this.&#13;
&#13;
                       This is an extraordinarily good project.                It isn't&#13;
&#13;
             that it is based on as thorough a sectoral study as was the&#13;
&#13;
             railroad loan or the highway loan in the case of the Argentine&#13;
&#13;
             or as will be the power loan that we will shortly discuss in&#13;
&#13;
             relation to Brazil.     It is not.    As Mr. Tolley said, this is&#13;
&#13;
             a holding action.     l&lt;\fe are not satisfied   "t-li th   the amount of&#13;
&#13;
             planning in education in Ethiopia, nor is the Ethiopian&#13;
&#13;
             Government.   But "tA.re are quite confident that this project is&#13;

&#13;
           and sounder educational system.&#13;
&#13;
                      So unless there is question, we \vill consider the&#13;
&#13;
           project approved and move to the next subject.&#13;

                     Hr. Binute.&#13;

                     MR. BIHUTE:         t1r. Chairman 1 I would like to say a fe&#13;
&#13;
           words to thank you for recommending this project and loan&#13;
&#13;
           to the Board and my colleagues for approving it with their&#13;
&#13;
           warm support.     And I would like to thank the staff particular y&#13;
&#13;
           for the excellent work it has done in so few months, and&#13;
&#13;
           perhaps I JT\ay point out one aspect of this project \.Jhich Hr.&#13;
&#13;
           Tolley also mentioned.&#13;
&#13;
                     This is an interim project pending the establishment&#13;
&#13;
           of a detailed program for the expansion of the education&#13;
&#13;
           system in Ethiopia.     And I would hope that the Bank would ~e&#13;
&#13;
           prepared to give assistance to this country when the detailed&#13;
&#13;
           program would be issued.         I am sure that the Government will&#13;
&#13;
           come to the Bank \vith a request to help it and to cover a&#13;
&#13;
           larger portion of local cost.&#13;
&#13;
                     Thank you very much.&#13;
