&#13;
        A STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE&#13;
 1. Country and Sector Issues&#13;
 1.      Central African Republic (CAR) is a poor landlocked country but has been&#13;
 growing steadily over the past few years. CAR size is about 623000 square meters,&#13;
 with a population of 4.3 million. According to a household survey data, 67.2 percent of&#13;
 the population lived below the poverty line in 2003. Approximately 20 percent of the&#13;
 population lives in Bangui, the capital city. Beyond the political turmoil, economic&#13;
 development has also been hampered by the country's landlocked position, a transport&#13;
 system poorly maintained, a largely unskilled workforce, and a legacy of misdirected&#13;
 economic policies. The government has also had poor revenue collection and budget&#13;
 outcomes, and is behind in military and civilian payrolls. The country thus remains poor&#13;
 despite the economic potential of CAR's natural resources (diamonds, gold, uranium, and&#13;
 timber) and favorable farming conditions. The agricultural sector generates more than&#13;
 half of the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP). CAR continues to emerge from a&#13;
 fragile economic environment and macroeconomic performance and policy&#13;
 implementation have strengthened. With a per capita GDP of $350 in 2006 and with 67&#13;
 percent of the population living below the poverty line, it is one of the world's poorest&#13;
 countries. This situation has been compounded by the international financial crisis. CAR&#13;
 ranked 171st out of 177 countries in United Nation Development Program's 2007/08&#13;
 Human Development Index. Poverty is widespread, and the incidence of poverty in rural&#13;
 areas is higher. Access to even basic education and health services is minimal, and&#13;
 outcomes are worsening as these sectors have been significantly under-funded for several&#13;
 decades. CAR reached the HPIC completion point in June 2009 highlighting the progress&#13;
 accomplished by the Government in terms of governance, public financial management&#13;
 amd implementation of social programs.&#13;
 2.      Telecom and ICT Snapshot. In CAR, out of a total population of 4.3 million in&#13;
 December 2007, the number of main fixed lines in operation was 5,000 and the number&#13;
 of mobile subscriptions was 0.35 million, representing a fixed teledensity1 of 0.12 and a&#13;
 mobile teledensity2 of 7.99. The number of Internet broadband subscribers in 2006 and&#13;
 the international bandwidth were respectively estimated to 13.000 and 14 to 16 Mbps in&#13;
 end 2007. In CAR, the number of cybercafé and was estimated less than 30. The&#13;
 eGovernment Readiness for CAR was 0.1412 in 2008 as compared to a level of 0.2530 as&#13;
 an average for Central (average eGovernment Readiness for the World: 0.4514).&#13;
 3.    The telecom and ICT detailed structure. The incumbent operator SOCATEL&#13;
 which was originally 60 percent owned by the government and 40 percent by France&#13;
 Telecom through France Câbles &amp; Radio is now a fully state-owned operator. There are&#13;
 now four private mobile operators in CAR: Telecel, Moov (AtlantiqueTelecom),&#13;
&#13;
 1&#13;
     Number of fixed telephone lines per 100 inhabitants.&#13;
 2&#13;
     Number of mobile subscriptions per 100 inhabitants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        1&#13;
&amp;#12;Nationlink and Orange (SOCATEL has recently launched a limited mobile service using&#13;
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) technology). There were about 12,000 fixed&#13;
lines in CAR in 2008 (only available in the capital Bangui and Berberati). Other than this&#13;
limited coverage, there were phone booths ("cabines publiques") in a number of cities.&#13;
SOCATEL's network is in a poor condition (broadband services using DSL3 technology&#13;
will be limited in CAR). Therefore wireless broadband will be the main means used to&#13;
deliver high-speed connectivity to the population. As of July 2008, there were about&#13;
600,000 mobile subscribers. All four mobile operators offer Internet services (Orange has&#13;
recently launched broadband Internet services in Bangui ­ using WiMAX4 technology).&#13;
The entry of Orange into this relatively small market is likely to re-energize the mobile&#13;
market and lead to faster growth and slightly lower prices. The mobile operators are&#13;
providing services in approximately 26 cities. Although SOCATEL is making some&#13;
progress on refurbishing and upgrading its network, the copper lines at the local level are&#13;
far too unreliable to allow them to launch DSL services. Doubtless Orange and other&#13;
mobile operators will capitalize on this market gap but without a cheaper national and&#13;
international bandwidth, the number of Internet subscribers is likely to increase modestly.&#13;
As far as bandwidth/backbones are concerned, the network depends on satellite&#13;
connectivity (even for national connectivity between the capital and secondary cities) and&#13;
few microwave and low-capacity radio links exist.&#13;
4.      Policy and regulation overview. The fixed-line network is still a monopoly but&#13;
competition has become important in the mobile and Internet segments. The Law No&#13;
96.008 of January 1996 provided provisions for the liberalization of the sector and&#13;
created a Telecom regulatory authority (ART - Agence de Régulation des&#13;
Télécommunications). However, it was not formally established until 2003. The&#13;
Ministère des Postes, des Télécommunications chargé des Nouvelles Technologies&#13;
(MPTNT) was created in 1999 and has responsibility for the country's ICT policy. The&#13;
national policy adopted in 2006 aims to: (i) promote public participation through&#13;
dialogue; (ii) support initiatives of basic communities through information, knowledge,&#13;
and technical skill exchanges; (iii) develop the broadcasting sector and introduce&#13;
innovations by providing social communication instruments and; (iv) promote systems of&#13;
popularization, supervision, training, and horizontal communication. The actual legal&#13;
framework for telecommunications in CAR is set by the laws No 07.020 (regulating the&#13;
telecommunications sector) and No 07.021 of December 28, 2007. Following the&#13;
adoption of the Central African Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC)&#13;
Directives on Electronic Communications Services in line with good international&#13;
practices and consistent with the Central African Backbone (CAB) design, the&#13;
Government of CAR is currently using the Project Preparation Facility (PPF) to finance&#13;
the harmonization and adaptation of sector legal and regulatory framework.&#13;
5.      High cost structure is resulting in less trade. The isolation and high cost&#13;
structure of CAR have held back the availability of affordable telecommunications&#13;
infrastructure. Without access to low price and high quality telecommunications&#13;
services, it is very costly for the population to trade with each other, and with the rest of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3&#13;
    DSL or Digital Subscriber Line.&#13;
4&#13;
    WiMAX or Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  2&#13;
&amp;#12;the world (limiting opportunities to create jobs, and expand production of goods and&#13;
services).&#13;
&#13;
6.      The absence of 21st century backbone infrastructure5 at the national level is&#13;
an additional key constraint. All operators do not have broadband terrestrial networks&#13;
and rely on expensive and poor quality satellite connectivity or small microwave&#13;
backbones to link cities at the national level. Some projects have been proposed in the&#13;
past, but none have materialized due to a combination of factors, including inadequate&#13;
legal and regulatory framework and investment climates, and the complexity of a multi-&#13;
country investment project and related concerns about financial sustainability. Recently,&#13;
existing operators (fixed and mobile) and public authorities began to explore new&#13;
business models that could foster the deployment of such infrastructure at the national&#13;
level. The new infrastructure could be developed through a Public Private Partnership&#13;
(PPP) under principles of competitive level pricing and Open Access.6 Such backbone&#13;
would connect the capital and secondary cities (contributing to reduce the urban-rural&#13;
divide) to neighboring countries but also provide redundancy routes (network&#13;
securization). Operators and service providers could then provide affordable and better&#13;
quality ICT and eGovernment services to citizens. Effective cross-border links and&#13;
supporting regulatory frameworks are therefore critical for CAR, and the region as a&#13;
whole.&#13;
&#13;
7.     Closing the infrastructure gap and opening up access to cheaper bandwidth.&#13;
The transmission network (long-distance and international) is entirely based on satellites.&#13;
The proposed fiber-optic transmission backbone proposed by the Central African&#13;
Backbone (CAB) Program would link the telecommunications network in CAR to those&#13;
in Cameroon, Chad and eventually Republic of Congo and Democratic Republic of&#13;
Congo. The telecommunications network in CAR will then connect international&#13;
submarine fiber-optic cables, with onward connectivity to other African countries,&#13;
Europe and the Far East. The CAB Program would provide additional bandwidth&#13;
capacity to enable the development of the telecommunications and internet sector.&#13;
8.      Without cross-border initiatives and regional coordination, Central African&#13;
Republic may not be in a position to solely achieve low-cost broadband access and&#13;
low-cost regional connectivity. A prefeasibility study has been conducted by a&#13;
specialized international firm in Cameroon, CAR and Chad that evidence the economies&#13;
of scale and cost efficiencies of a truly regional and fully integrated end-to-end backbone&#13;
infrastructure. The study demonstrates the financial and technical feasibility of the CAB&#13;
Program and recommends the implementation of CAB APL1 involving Cameroon, CAR&#13;
and Chad. The study forms the basis for the design and framework for the CAB Program&#13;
intervention. The CAB network, as designed, is a regional telecommunications network&#13;
made up of suitable on-ward terrestrial fiber connections to submarine fiber-optical cable&#13;
systems linking several Central African countries and providing the region with a digital&#13;
broadband access to the global fiber network. In addition to the build-out of&#13;
&#13;
5&#13;
  For the purposes of this project, backbone infrastructure refers to a collection of high-capacity fiber-optic&#13;
or point-to-point wireless (e.g. microwave) links both within countries and between countries.&#13;
6&#13;
  Open Access is broadly defined as an equal opportunity for operators and service providers to have&#13;
unfettered access to specific infrastructure or services under similar terms and conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      3&#13;
&amp;#12;approximately 2,200 km of new fiber-optic infrastructure, the planned broadband&#13;
backbone would leverage the 1000 km existing fiber-optic infrastructure laid along the oil&#13;
pipeline between Kribi (Cameroon) and Doba (Chad). The study developed nine&#13;
scenarios, the traffic demand and flows for the targeted countries and has set key&#13;
principles (CAB network is to be a shared infrastructure promoting an Open Access&#13;
regime and owned and operated according to PPP principles).&#13;
&#13;
9.      In May 2007, based on the findings of the study, the heads of state of CEMAC&#13;
adopted a Declaration calling for the establishment of the CAB under Open Access and&#13;
Public-Private Partnership (PPP) principles and asked for donors intervention. In line&#13;
with the Regional Integration Assistance Strategy (RIAS) and national CAS/ PRSP, the&#13;
World Bank Group (World Bank and IFC) and the African Development Bank (AfDB)&#13;
have provided Technical Assistance (TA) to CEMAC and Central African countries to&#13;
conduct preparatory studies. Regional and national technical committees were set-up&#13;
since 2007. In parallel, the World Bank has participated as an observer to the elaboration&#13;
of the 2008 CEMAC Directives on Electronic Communications Services in line with&#13;
sector good practices and the CAB Program as designed.&#13;
&#13;
10.     A new operating model consisting of a new regional network and national&#13;
telecom operators will become fully integrated thus driving prices lower. The CAB&#13;
structure as designed and supported by the proposed World Bank Program calls for the&#13;
establishment of a new regional telecom operator and national operators. These operators&#13;
would be in charge of reselling international, regional and national capacity to existing&#13;
national operators and service providers at discounted rates, compared to current pricing&#13;
in the targeted countries. In a medium scenario, the international bandwidth price&#13;
reduction could be above 50 percent for the landlocked countries during the first year of&#13;
operation. As such, the CAB network will increase competition for the provision of&#13;
international and national capacity (new alternative infrastructure, fiber-optic backbone,&#13;
competing with satellite and microwave connectivity).&#13;
&#13;
11.     Key principles (promoting Open Access regimes, developing wholesale markets&#13;
and promoting PPPs) have been defined in the study and have to be endorsed by all&#13;
participating countries in order to be eligible for World Bank financing. To keep some&#13;
flexibility, the detailed arrangements (in terms of ownership and management) will be&#13;
defined at the country-level, taking into account the difference of all eligible countries in&#13;
terms of sector structure, level of development and access, operational and financial&#13;
situation of the respective State Owned Enterprise (SOE).&#13;
&#13;
12.     The backbone network that will be installed at the country-level will use a&#13;
hybrid competitive and cooperative approach. This reflects the need to differentiate&#13;
the role of the government and the operators and to build strong partnerships with the&#13;
private sector to develop telecommunications infrastructure.&#13;
13.     The government's role is to focus on providing the right incentives for&#13;
infrastructure and services to reach areas unattractive to the private sector on a purely&#13;
commercial basis, as well as in cases where large initial sunk investments are required.&#13;
Government participation through the financing of segments of the CAB backbone will&#13;
be used to buy-down the cost of capital; therefore the prices that could be charged to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             4&#13;
&amp;#12;consumers to recover the investment (regulatory mechanisms will be set-up to ensure that&#13;
lower costs are passed to the consumer). Additional government support may take the&#13;
form of government participation in the new legal entity created for the build-out of the&#13;
backbone networks (such as through contribution of existing assets), guarantees,&#13;
subordinated debt, ensuring rights-of-way, and/or commitment to purchase certain&#13;
capacity on the network for a given time period.&#13;
14.     Role of the private sector. The private sector will participate in financing, and&#13;
will install, maintain and operate the CAB network. The capital and financing structure&#13;
will be a blend of public and private sector. The inclusion of the private sector and profit&#13;
sharing can bring several benefits including: (i) access to private finance; (ii) reduced&#13;
operational risk for public sector; (iii) faster delivery of capital projects; (iv) project&#13;
management skills; and (v) entrepreneurship and innovation. The PPP structure will&#13;
share the risks and rewards between the government and the private companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    CAB PPP Structure and financing&#13;
&#13;
15.     The CEMAC - in coordination with the Governments of Cameroon, CAR and&#13;
Chad, the World Bank Group, the AfDB, and the International Telecommunication Union&#13;
(ITU) - has launched the recruitment of the investment bank and legal adviser&#13;
(transaction advisers) to finalize the structure and mobilize the private funding.&#13;
&#13;
16.     The design and ownership structure of the PPP will (i) maximize the use of&#13;
private financing (or minimize the use of public financing); (ii) ensure feasibility and&#13;
attractiveness of the transaction; (iii) secure Open Access to regional connectivity&#13;
infrastructure; and (iv) ensure competitive, reasonable tariff of international, regional and&#13;
national capacity.&#13;
&#13;
17.      New legal entities will be formed for the purposes of owning and operating the&#13;
CAB networks. This will take the form of a consortium including the private operators,&#13;
private financers', incumbent operators and/ or governments. The private sector will&#13;
install and maintain the CAB networks. A contract will be set between the private sector&#13;
and the existing public telecommunications operators on the management of the national&#13;
backbones (the new structure could also be leveraged to manage these networks). Final&#13;
ownership distribution will be based on the amount of private financing mobilized and&#13;
final contributions made by the Governments.&#13;
&#13;
18.    The IFC is playing a role as part of the World Bank Group's support to the&#13;
CEMAC and to Governments as they finalize an optimal structure for the public-private&#13;
partnership that ensures the feasibility and attractiveness of the transaction. If needed&#13;
IFC may also assist in mobilizing funding or assist investors7.&#13;
19.    Financing CAB Program APL1. The first phase of the CAB program proposed&#13;
for IDA financing will cover Cameroon, Central African Republic and Chad. The first&#13;
&#13;
7&#13;
  In consultation with the Conflict of Interest Office, the WBG has disclosed the potential risk of perception&#13;
of conflict of interest to the Governments highlighting the expected benefits from the institution to&#13;
intervene as a Group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      5&#13;
&amp;#12;Phase of CAB Program8 comprising APL1A and APL1B will be structured as a vertical&#13;
APL. APL1A will to cover the technical assistance to strengthen the enabling&#13;
environment and prepare the PPP structure for the establishment of the CAB Network.&#13;
APL1B will focus on financing the connectivity infrastructure of the CAB network. To&#13;
establish the CAB infrastructure in Cameroon, CAR and Chad (that will utilize the&#13;
existing 1,000 km fiber-optic backbone laid next to the oil Chad-Cameroon oil pipeline),&#13;
approximately $40 million will be contributed from the first phase of the CAB program&#13;
(technical assistance will be provided through APL1A and connectivity infrastructure&#13;
will be partly financed by APL1B).&#13;
&#13;
20.    In addition, the AfDB will provide parallel financing to establish complementary&#13;
backbone infrastructure in CAB APL1 countries. However, the cost and design of this&#13;
additional infrastructure is not included in the CAB APL1. As structured, the World Bank&#13;
CAB Program and CAB APL1 will not be affected if the AfDB financing does not&#13;
materialize.&#13;
&#13;
21.     Private sector interest. An additional $27.8 million is estimated to be needed to&#13;
establish the CAB network for CAB APL1 countries. It will be mobilized from the&#13;
private sector (private equity, off-take agreements and commercial debt). The structure as&#13;
recommended has been presented to all public and private operators in CAB APL1&#13;
countries (but also in other eligible countries). Despite the economic and financial crisis,&#13;
all operators9 have confirmed their strong interest in the venture since CAB will lower&#13;
significantly their operating cost and provide new opportunities for additional network&#13;
coverage. Several operators have announced that they will explore the opportunity to&#13;
contribute financially, and some international commercial banks have also expressed an&#13;
interest.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Rationale for Bank involvement&#13;
&#13;
22.    Strong government commitment to the ICT sector. The government is&#13;
strongly committed to the use of ICT. The government has clearly identified ICT as a&#13;
driver of growth in CAR. This has been articulated in the sector policy document&#13;
published in August 2006 « Politique Stratégies et Plan d'Action de l'édification de la&#13;
Société de l'information en République Centrafricaine ». This prioritization has recently&#13;
been reaffirmed through the identification of the ICT sector as a key source of future&#13;
economic growth. In 2007, the heads of state of the CEMAC have adopted a Declaration&#13;
to implement this program as a key tool for regional integration and growth. Significant&#13;
technical and financial resources have been mobilized by the countries and the CEMAC&#13;
Commission to accelerate the implementation of CAB.&#13;
&#13;
8&#13;
  The first Phase, CAB APL1, includes two parts: APL1A and APL1B . See Para 28 for more explanation&#13;
of the structure.&#13;
9&#13;
  To provide a comparison to the US$30 million, the project aim to raise from the private sector, more than&#13;
US$40 million has been invested in the Telecom sector in CAR (same amount expected in 2009). However,&#13;
without key principles as set in the CAB project (shared infrastructure, Open Access and co-financing from&#13;
CAB APL1), no operator could develop such infrastructure in CAR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    6&#13;
&amp;#12;23.     The proposed operation is consistent with the Interim Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy in CAR, the PSRP process and particularly within the framework of the&#13;
Africa Action Plan. The Interim CAS highlights the role of key infrastructure (such as&#13;
roads and telecom backbones) and the need for policy harmonization in the sector. The&#13;
project is consistent with the four strategic pillars of the PSRP (process launched in June&#13;
2007): (i) restore security, consolidate peace and prevent conflict; (ii) promote good&#13;
governance and the rule of law; (iii) rebuild and diversify the economy; and (iv) develop&#13;
human capital. The Bank's Africa region development strategy discussed at the Board in&#13;
July 2003, identified advances in ICT as one of the three emerging positive trends in the&#13;
21st century for Africa, offering "enormous opportunities to leapfrog stages of&#13;
development". The CITCAR also fits within the Bank's comprehensive Africa Action&#13;
Plan developed in 2005, which further articulates goals and objectives covering several&#13;
important development areas including: (i) building national development strategies and&#13;
measuring results; (ii) building capable states and improving governance; (iii) supporting&#13;
drivers of growth; and (iv) strengthening and implementing partnerships at the country&#13;
level. The CITCAR will facilitate cross-border communications traffic and will promote&#13;
trade, stimulate cross-border movement of factors of production and promote regional&#13;
integration.&#13;
24.    The CITCAR fits well with World Bank Group's Regional Integration&#13;
Assistance Strategy for Africa (RIAS), particularly within the framework of the&#13;
Africa Action Plan. The Bank's RIAS discussed at the Board in April 2004, identified&#13;
advances in ICT as one of the three emerging positive trends in the twenty-first century&#13;
for Africa, and highlight its role for the regional connectivity objective. The CITCAR&#13;
and APL1A will strengthen and implement partnerships at the regional level (including&#13;
regulatory harmonization) and will support for both Economic Community of Central&#13;
African States (ECCAS) and CEMAC objective of creating a unified economic space in&#13;
Central Africa.&#13;
25.     The World Bank Group is well placed to contribute within the frame of a&#13;
multiple development partners' effort. The WBG has been involved in the CAB&#13;
program since 2005. The May 2007 Declaration of the CEMAC heads of state adopted&#13;
called explicitly for World Bank Group financial support for the implementation of the&#13;
CAB program. The overall program has been formulated with other key stakeholders and&#13;
DFIs (the AfDB joined the initiative in 2007 and is providing parallel financing for the&#13;
CAB Program; The African Union (AU) is also playing an important role in facilitating&#13;
inter-governmental cooperation and policy harmonization, in conjunction with the&#13;
CEMAC).&#13;
3. Higher level objectives to which the project contributes&#13;
&#13;
26.     The development objective will be the engine of shared growth achieved by:&#13;
(i) accelerating the physical rollout of backbone infrastructure (investment intervention&#13;
based on PPPs to leverage private sector investment in infrastructure); and (ii) removing&#13;
monopoly regimes through policy and regulatory support to ensure that once in place, the&#13;
infrastructure is accessible to all operators on open, transparent and non-discriminatory&#13;
terms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            7&#13;
&amp;#12;27.     The project will help reduce the cost of doing business in CAR. In the 2009&#13;
Doing Business report which presents quantitative indicators on business regulations and&#13;
the protection of property rights compared across economies, CAR was ranked 180 out of&#13;
181 countries, while Cameroun was ranked 164, Equatorial Guinea 167, Republic of&#13;
Congo 178, and Gabon 151. Infrastructure services remain costly and inefficient, thus&#13;
making the cost of doing business very high. For CAR to achieve higher and sustained&#13;
growth performance, it will need to develop rapidly its basic infrastructure. A better&#13;
communications infrastructure, capable of delivering advanced ICT services throughout&#13;
the country would reduce the cost of doing business.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     B PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
1. Lending instrument&#13;
&#13;
28.     Lending instrument. The lending instrument is a Regional IDA horizontal and&#13;
vertical Adaptable Program Loan (APL). The Communications Infrastructure and&#13;
Technology APL Project (APL1A) ­ Central African Republic Grant (CITCAR)is the&#13;
first part of the first phase of the CAB Program. The APL instrument is well-suited to&#13;
take into consideration the length of time it takes to achieve the overall objective of&#13;
establishing a regional network for Central Africa. An APL is also flexible enough to&#13;
accommodate the different level of readiness of the participating countries (horizontal&#13;
APL) and to phase Technical assistance if needed prior to the mobilization of the required&#13;
financing for the infrastructure (vertical APL).&#13;
29.     Breakdown of Regional and National IDA allocations. Since this is a project&#13;
included in a regional program, supplementary regional IDA funding can be used to&#13;
leverage country allocations for up to two-thirds of the full proposed IDA amount of the&#13;
project, with country allocations covering one third of the project cost attributable to each&#13;
individual country involved (taking into account that the National IDA allocation cannot&#13;
exceed 20 percent of the FY National Allocation). The table below provides a summary&#13;
of the regional/national IDA breakdown for CITCAR and estimated breakdown for the&#13;
activities in CAR to be supported under APL1B10.&#13;

&#13;
 30.    Project Development Objective (PDO). The core PDO is to contribute to&#13;
 increase geographical reach and usage of regional broadband network services and&#13;
 reduce their prices.&#13;
&#13;
 31.     Key monitoring and evaluation indicators are summarized in Table 1.&#13;
 However since the first Phase of CAB includes two parts: APL 1A (including CITCAR)&#13;
 and APL1B , the only outcome indicator retained for CITCAR is related to the volume&#13;
 of national traffic. Others outcome indicators for CAR related to APL1B are provided on&#13;
 an indicative basis.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 3. Project components&#13;
&#13;
 32.    The first phase of the CAB proposed for CAR will be structured as a vertical APL&#13;
 to cover first the technical assistance to strengthen the enabling environment and prepare&#13;
 the PPP structure for the establishment of the CAB (APL1A) then a subsequent part will&#13;
 focus on financing the connectivity infrastructure of the CAB (APL1B).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 11&#13;
      E1: It is equivalent to two (2) Mbps.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          9&#13;
&amp;#12;33.     The CITCAR (part of APL1A) will therefore finance activities related to the&#13;
"enabling environment" Component and the "project management" component while&#13;
APL1B (expected to be presented for Board approval in April 2010) will finance&#13;
activities related to the "connectivity" component described in the CAB Program. APL1B&#13;
will be triggered after (i) the establishment by the recipients and other stakeholders of a&#13;
legal structure which will install and manage the CAB network in accordance with PPP&#13;
principles and Open Access regime; and (ii) the CAB legal structure has received the&#13;
legal rights to install, manage and operate the CAB network on the Recipient's territory.&#13;
&#13;
34.   The CITCAR will have the following components and activities (see Annex 3&#13;
for more details):&#13;
&#13;
35.      Component 1 ­ Enabling environment ($5.7 million). This component will&#13;
provide support mainly in the form of TA, training and equipments in order to (i)&#13;
modernize the policy, legal and regulatory environment; (ii) strengthen key public&#13;
institutions (including ART, Haut Conseil de la Communication (HCC) and SOCATEL);&#13;
and (iii) promote a pro-competitive environment and restructure of incumbent operators.&#13;
This component is a key for the effective establishment of the CAB network.&#13;
   -    Modernize and harmonize the legal, regulatory and institutional framework&#13;
        in CAR to accelerate sector growth and ICT development. The project will&#13;
        finance the following activities: (i) TA to modernize and harmonize the legal and&#13;
        regulatory framework for Electronic Communications Services and (ii) TA to&#13;
        develop ICT legislation and institutional framework (e.g. Digital signature,&#13;
        eCommerce, Intellectual Property Rights, Data Privacy).&#13;
&#13;
   -    Strengthen capacity of key public stakeholders (MPTNT, ART, and HCC) to&#13;
        promote further sector reforms. It include in particular the following activities: (i)&#13;
        TA to develop regulatory tools (i.e., interconnection/tariffs, networks monitoring,&#13;
        Open Access); (ii) TA to increase ICT access in remote areas (iii) TA to review&#13;
        spectrum management framework in CAR and prepare bidding documents for the&#13;
        acquisition of a spectrum management and monitoring system; (iv) training/&#13;
        capacity building; and (v) equipments (i.e., spectrum management and&#13;
        monitoring system, information systems).&#13;
&#13;
   -    Promote a pro-competitive environment and restructure of Incumbent&#13;
        operators to maximize the benefits from the regional network. The project will&#13;
        finance in particular the following activities: (i) TA to liberalize further the&#13;
        sector; (ii) TA to promote and establish PPP to deploy the CAB; and (iii) TA to&#13;
        define and implement the restructuring options, and privatize incumbent&#13;
        operators.&#13;
&#13;
   -    Establish Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) to complement the other&#13;
        investments that the government and the private-sector are undertaking to boost&#13;
        connectivity and the capacity of the regional backbone network. The project will&#13;
        finance the following activities: (i) TA to design the establishment of a National&#13;
        and Regional IXP; and (ii) equipments for the National and Regional IXPs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             10&#13;
&amp;#12;   -    Launch structuring and start-up consultancies required for the&#13;
        establishment of CAB networks including CAB-related environmental and&#13;
        social consultancies (i.e. Environmental Management Plans (EMP), Resettlement&#13;
        Action Plans (RAPs) and Indigenous Peoples Plan (IPP) if planned).&#13;
&#13;
36.    Component 2 ­ Project management capability ($1.6 million) will consist of&#13;
financing project management related issues. It will support the following activities: (i)&#13;
consultants to staff the Project Coordination Unit (i.e., a procurement specialist, a&#13;
financial manager, an internal auditor, an accountant and a backbone expert); (ii)&#13;
equipments (i.e., financial management system); (iii) various TA (i.e. audits); (iv) small&#13;
works; (v) training; and (vi) operating expenses.&#13;
&#13;
37.     With respect to CAB APL1 countries including CAR, the connectivity component&#13;
will be financed underAPL1B expected to be approved in April 2010. The financing to be&#13;
provided for CAR for this subsequent phase is estimated at about $9.9 million (including&#13;
contingencies). Most connectivity infrastructure will support the deployment of regional&#13;
backhaul links in the country and across the borders with neighboring countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4. Lessons learned and reflected in the project design&#13;
&#13;
38.     Different roles for public and private actors in the ICT sector. The CITCAR&#13;
reflects the need to differentiate the role of the government and the operators and to build&#13;
strong partnerships with the private sector to develop telecommunications infrastructure.&#13;
The role of the government is to focus on providing the right incentives for infrastructure&#13;
and services to reach areas unattractive to the private sector on a purely commercial&#13;
basis, as well as in cases where large initial sunk-investments are required. The private&#13;
sector is better placed to invest in, install, manage and maintain ICT infrastructure.&#13;
Moreover the inclusion of the private sector and profit sharing can bring the following&#13;
benefits: (i) access to private finance; (ii) reduced operational risk for public sector; (iii)&#13;
faster delivery of capital projects; (iv)            project management skills; and (v)&#13;
entrepreneurship and innovation. Therefore, the models presented here which involve the&#13;
sharing of risk between the government and the private companies (PPP) can be defined&#13;
as an agreement between government and private entities for the purpose of delivering a&#13;
project or service by sharing the risks and rewards of the venture. The PPP model helps&#13;
in bridging gaps in quality, speed, and efficiency in the provision of services by the&#13;
public sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5. Alternatives considered and reasons for rejection&#13;
&#13;
39.     Focusing on development of applications would be premature. Activities for&#13;
the development of eGovernment services are eligible for support under the CAB&#13;
program. However, given the inadequate infrastructure in CAR, the project will include&#13;
very limited support to the development of applications.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              11&#13;
&amp;#12;40.     Cooperative approach is welcome in a resource-constrained environment.&#13;
The project will promote the development of a collaborative framework to finance and&#13;
establish a regional and national backbone. An alternative design would have been to&#13;
finance backbone links under a competitive structure, where each operator would bid&#13;
separately for the construction of a particular link or group of links. However, the&#13;
countries targeted have inadequate environment or the market size does not justify&#13;
multiple backbones outside the main cities. The proposed solution will accelerate the&#13;
deployment of broadband backbones within CAR and will be used by all operators and&#13;
service providers (Open Access).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     C IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
1. Institutional and implementation arrangements&#13;
&#13;
Institutional and implementation arrangements (see Annex 5).&#13;
41.     The MPTNT will be responsible for the overall coordination, implementation, and&#13;
supervision of the project. For each activity concerned, MPTNT, through the Project&#13;
Coordination Unit (PCU), will consult with and delegate to the relevant agencies and&#13;
ministries.&#13;
&#13;
42.     The implementation arrangements involve three organizational levels: (i) a&#13;
Project Steering Committee (Comité de Pilotage) will be responsible for providing advice&#13;
regarding cross-sectoral issues; (ii) the PCU will be responsible for project&#13;
implementation, coordination of activities and fiduciary management; and (iii) a CAR&#13;
CAB Technical Committee that will provide technical input for the development of the&#13;
regional backbone.&#13;
43.     The MPTNT and the CAR CAB Technical Committee liaise with other CAB&#13;
participants.12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2. Monitoring and evaluation of outcomes/results&#13;
&#13;
44.    Monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) of CAB will be embedded in the various&#13;
components of the project, and TA provided through the project will include support for&#13;
M&amp;E. The MPTNT and the ART will collect most indicators needed to monitor and&#13;
evaluate the project (the last indicators are collected by an international organization on a&#13;
yearly basis). Both national institutions have been collecting the selected indicators for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12&#13;
  To date CAB APL1 countries have established: (i) an Inter-Ministerial Committee involving sector&#13;
ministers, (ii) an expert commission involving three representatives from each participating CAB APL1&#13;
country, and one representative from the following institutions: the World Bank, the AfDB, the CEMAC,&#13;
the Economic Community of Central African States (ECCAS) and the International Telecommunications&#13;
Union; (iii) national technical committees involving representatives from the government, the regulatory&#13;
agency, the public and private operators and users groups.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   12&#13;
&amp;#12;several years. However, the project will provide support through technical assistance to&#13;
strengthen their statistical units.&#13;
45.     Moreover, at the regional level, an IDF grant (CEMAC - strengthening capacity in&#13;
the telecom &amp; IT sector - IDF Grant P109923) has been processed to strengthen the&#13;
telecom legal and institutional environment of CEMAC region and improve the telecom&#13;
and information technology representation/visibility to increase regional&#13;
telecommunications and Information Technology (IT) investments. The Grant will&#13;
finance short term TA to adequately monitor regional telecom and IT activities and to&#13;
develop a common M&amp;E system shared by all CEMAC member states (including CAR).&#13;
The establishment of this M&amp;E system will (i) increase knowledge transfer between&#13;
member states and reinforce CEMAC coordination and policy role for the region; (ii)&#13;
improve sector visibility for the government (as a main growth contributor) and therefore&#13;
improve sector policy decision to attract additional foreign direct investment.&#13;
46.     Outcome indicators for CAR related to APL1B (financing of the Connectivity/&#13;
infrastructure component defined in the CAB Program) are provided on a indicative&#13;
basis.&#13;

  3. Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
  47.     The component 1 will support the establishment of the CAB PPP environment&#13;
  and structure. APL1B will finance CAB connectivity infrastructure to be implemented&#13;
  through the set PPP. The CITCAR will also stimulate sector development in the country&#13;
  and promote competition. The stimulation of the supply of low-cost wholesale&#13;
  international connectivity will be a major boost to investment and competition in the&#13;
  downstream segments of the market. These benefits thereof will last beyond the end of&#13;
  the project, increasing the sustainability of the project outcome.&#13;

                                                   time being however, investment in the&#13;
                                                   telecommunications sector continues to&#13;

                                                   vertical APL will mitigate this rsk since the&#13;
                                                   Public financing could be adjusted to match&#13;
                                                   the requirements and parts not funded by&#13;
                                                   the private sector.&#13;
Governance issues with regards to         S        While the participation of enterprises with       M&#13;
build out of infrastructure where                  poor efficiency records in the roll-out of the&#13;
SOE coexist with private                           infrastructure may not be desirable, it&#13;
operators                                          cannot be completely avoided, especially in&#13;
                                                   countries where the telecommunications&#13;
                                                   market is not open to competition. Hence,&#13;
                                                   the project will provide funds to promote&#13;

   For the time being, however, investment in the telecommunications sector continues to remain strong.&#13;
The investment and legal advisers will test the market before finalizing/freezing the overall structure to&#13;
ensure private sector adoption and adequate financing. IFC in collaboration with the World Bank will&#13;
provide support to the CEMAC Commission and CAB APL1 countries to ensure adequate final structuring&#13;
(feasibility and attractivity of the transaction) while ensuring long term economic viability and adequate&#13;
return for potential investors. IFC could also consider mobilizing funding.&#13;

&#13;
      D APPRAISAL SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
1. Economic and financial analysis&#13;
51.     The benefits accrued in the targeted countries (i.e., increased access to quality and&#13;
affordable ICT services) spill over country boundaries as: (i) higher volumes increase the&#13;
viability of the regional communications infrastructure network, decrease cost of access&#13;
and increase trade between African countries and (ii) cross-border initiatives provide&#13;
countries with the incentives to develop missing infrastructure to increase ICT access.&#13;
Indeed, the implementation of the CAB Program will have a transformational impact on&#13;
regional connectivity which will impact regional trade and overall economic integration&#13;
of the participating CAB countries.&#13;
52.     A detailed traffic study and a financial model have been developed by&#13;
International consultants for CAB APL1 countries and Nigeria. Results from the study&#13;
shows that traffic will expand significantly due to the growth of mobile operators and the&#13;
development of the Internet market (i.e. International bandwidth in CAR will increase&#13;
from 7 Mbps in 2006, to 83 Mbps in 2011, to 143 Mbps in 2016) . The CAB network&#13;
will carry a significant portion of this traffic (especially for landlocked countries using&#13;
exclusively satellites).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               17&#13;
&amp;#12;53.    The opportunity cost in Cameroon, CAR and Chad calculated to measure&#13;
economies from the cost of providing bandwidth relying on satellite connection as&#13;
opposed to CAB Network until 2021 is estimated at $117 million (discount rate of 13&#13;
percent and average annual decrease of satellite connection of 8 percent).&#13;
54.    The economic impact in Cameroon, CAR and Chad on a 10 year model is&#13;
estimated at $94 million out of which $76 million as consumer surplus and $18 million as&#13;
producer surplus.&#13;
55.      Based on the financial projections and taking into account the existing public-&#13;
private structure, it is expected that CAB network could generate a positive net income in&#13;
the first twelve months of operations.&#13;
&#13;
2. Technical&#13;
56.     The design and ownership structure of the PPP to be established based on ongoing&#13;
technical assistance provided at Regional-level and the technical assistance to be&#13;
provided under the CITCAR will be consistent with international best-practices. The&#13;
CAB Program, APL1A and CITCAR will (i) maximize the use of private financing (or&#13;
minimize the use of public financing); (ii) ensure feasibility and attractiveness of the&#13;
transaction; and (iii) secure Open Access to regional connectivity infrastructure and&#13;
ensure competitive, reasonable tariff of international, regional and national capacity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3. Fiduciary&#13;
&#13;
57.    Financial Management. CAR is a conflict-affected country with a weak PFM&#13;
system which cannot be used directly to implement the proposed project (CITCAR).&#13;
Two Bank studies were recently undertaken (CFAA in 2007 and PEFA in 2008) and&#13;
concluded that public financial management was weak and lacked capacity in budgeting,&#13;
accounting, reporting, debt management, auditing and internal control systems. As of&#13;
December 2008, the country risk is high.&#13;
&#13;
58.     A PCU has been set up within MPTNT with full fiduciary responsibility to&#13;
manage the project. A financial manager has been hired on a competitive basis. Currently&#13;
the PCU does not have any FM system in place to manage the project. Hence the overall&#13;
FM risk is High at this point in time but the residual risk would be Moderate provided the&#13;
action plan provided in Annex 6 is implemented satisfactorily.&#13;
&#13;
59.    Disbursement: One Designated Account in CFAF will be opened in a&#13;
commercial bank and managed by PCU under the responsibility of the Project&#13;
Coordinator and the financial manager. Upon effectiveness, the DA will receive an initial&#13;
deposit equivalent to four month expenditures forecast and replenished regularly on a&#13;
monthly basis against statements of expenditures (SOE) through Withdrawal&#13;
Applications cleared by the Internal Auditor. Direct payment may be used whenever&#13;
appropriate for payments of expenditures equivalent to 20 percent or more of the DA. At&#13;
the beginning, the transactions-based disbursement method will apply. In the second FY,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           18&#13;
&amp;#12;the project may to shift to the report-based disbursement method if satisfactory Interim&#13;
Financial Reports (IFRs) and audit reports are submitted in a timely manner and the&#13;
project sustains satisfactory financial management rating.&#13;
&#13;
60.    The grant will finance 100% of eligible expenditures inclusive of taxes with the&#13;
exception of the Value Added Tax (VAT).&#13;
&#13;
61.     Procurement. The PCU of the MPTNT will be responsible for the&#13;
administration, coordination, monitoring of the Project, and procurement activities&#13;
including compliance with procurement procedures. The PCU is managed a coordinator&#13;
appointed by the Government, a financial manager, a procurement specialist, an internal&#13;
auditor and, an accountant, all to be recruited on a competitive basis14.&#13;
&#13;
62.    A PIM including the financial administrative arrangements with a detailed section&#13;
on procurement is currently drafted and outlines, among others, the procurement&#13;
arrangement and the relevant procedures applicable to the management of the grant.&#13;
&#13;
63.    Procurement corrective measures have been identified and an action plan has been&#13;
defined with tasks to be performed, responsible body as well as time-frame (see annex 7).&#13;
&#13;
64.      Procurement risk. The overall project risk for procurement is substantial&#13;
because, among other factors, there was no previous Bank operation with this ministry&#13;
and the PCU with procurement responsibility, which is been set up and staffed, is a&#13;
completely new entity and is not familiar with procurement processes. Although&#13;
procurement risk rating is presently substantial, the above well designed action plan with&#13;
mitigation measures to be implemented and appropriate monitoring will reasonably bring&#13;
this risk to moderate.&#13;
&#13;
65.     Guidelines: All international competitive bidding (ICB) and selection of&#13;
consultants will be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines:&#13;
Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004 and revised in&#13;
October 2006; and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by World&#13;
Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004 and revised in October 2006, and the provisions&#13;
stipulated in the Financing Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
4. Safeguard policies&#13;
&#13;
66.     Category B rating. The APL1A (including CITCAR) has a Category B rating.&#13;
Activities financed under CITCAR are fully consistent with the set of activities eligible&#13;
for financing under the CAB Program.&#13;
67.      The physical components of the CAB Program in CAR (to be financed under&#13;
APL1B) will mostly be limited to the establishment of the regional backbone which&#13;
consists of terrestrial networks (e.g. fiber-optic cables laid next to main national roads).&#13;
&#13;
14&#13;
     The financial manager and the procurement specialist are already recruited.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      19&#13;
&amp;#12;The risk associated with the kind of infrastructure financed under this Program is low,&#13;
and the project is therefore assigned to environmental category B under OP 4.01.&#13;
68.   The ESMF and the RPF have been prepared, reviewed and approved by the&#13;
Bank and publicly disclosed prior to appraisal in CAR. They are available at the&#13;
InfoShop.&#13;
69.      Specific costed Environmental Management Plans (EMP) and Resettlement&#13;
Action Plans (RAPs) will be prepared as necessary for the terrestrial facilities during&#13;
project implementation, in line with the ESMF and RPF, once the exact locations of those&#13;
facilities have been identified. The institutional responsibilities for preparing the various&#13;
safeguards instruments would lie with the implementing agency. These agencies will be&#13;
assisted by consultants financed by the project. Any specific required action for some of&#13;
the Civil Works will be taken into account during project implementation.&#13;
70.    Since CAB APL 1 (APL1A and APL1B) in CAR will only finance fiber-optic&#13;
cables laid next to main national roads (no rural networks and landing stations will be&#13;
financed), OP 4.10 for indigenous peoples, OP 4.36 for Forests and OP 4.11 for Cultural&#13;
Property will not be triggered. The CITCAR will not finance any fiber-optic cable/&#13;
backbone infrastructure (it will be funded under APL1B expected to be presented for&#13;
Board approval in April 2010).&#13;

ministries, as well as the Project Coordinator. The Steering Committee will provide&#13;
advice on coordination of cross-sectoral interventions and ensure consistency of ICT&#13;
activities carried out by different agencies/ institutions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
6.      The CITCAR Technical Committee has been established to provide technical&#13;
inputs from all key stakeholders from the sector on issues related to the establishment of&#13;
the CAB network. All technical studies conducted at national and regional level have&#13;
and will benefit from their support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Other institutional strategic elements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7.      Project Implementation Manuel (PIM): The PIM includes all procedures and&#13;
areas of M&amp;E, coordination and implementation, financial management (including&#13;
financial, administrative, accounting and procurement, internal controls and audits). The&#13;
PIM describes the diverse roles, responsibilities, and individual work programs of each&#13;
participating agency (including the timetable that shall be respected to ensure the success&#13;
of the project). Technical implementation of project activities shall be delegated to the&#13;
participating agencies and ministries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8.     World Bank supervision: The Bank will conduct a minimum of two supervision&#13;
missions per year during project implementation, including an annual progress review. A&#13;
midterm review will be conducted, which will encompass: (i) a thorough review of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            29&#13;
&amp;#12;execution of the project and the achievement of project objectives to date; and (ii)&#13;
agreement between the Bank and the Borrower on recommended measures to ensure&#13;
efficient execution of the project and successful achievement of project objectives in the&#13;
period after the review, all in accordance with agreed performance indicators. The&#13;
Borrower will provide the Bank a project completion report within six months of loan&#13;
closing and inputs to the Implementation Completion Report to be prepared by the Bank.&#13;
The Bank will support public dissemination of project information, including supervision&#13;
reports on the project's performance.&#13;

Country issues&#13;
&#13;
1.      CAR endured a long period of civil unrest characterized by the destruction of&#13;
infrastructure and equipment, and the absence of investments. Two Bank studies were&#13;
recently undertaken: a CFAA (2007) and a PEFA (2008). Although the Government of&#13;
CAR has not yet endorsed the conclusions of the PEFA, the latter is in line with the&#13;
CFAA. The two studies concluded that public financial management was weak and&#13;
lacked capacity in budgeting, accounting, reporting, debt management, auditing and&#13;
internal control systems. As of December 2008, the country risk is high.&#13;
&#13;

                                   32&#13;
&amp;#12;3.     Strengths: the project design is very simple in essence. The CITCAR will be&#13;
implemented by a PCU under the oversight of the MPTNT. Ultimately the same PCU&#13;
will manage AfDB financing - once effective - by building on the proposed fiduciary&#13;
arrangements. A Financial manager has been hired on competitive basis.&#13;
4.      Weaknesses and Action Plan: The financial management system is not yet in&#13;
place yet (including customization and training). A draft PIM has been prepared but is&#13;
not yet finalized (includes accounting, FM, auditing arrangements and procedures).&#13;
&#13;
Implementing entity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.      A PCU has been set up within MPTNT to manage the CITCAR. The PCU already&#13;
includes a coordinator (nominated), and will include financial manager, a procurement&#13;
specialist, an internal auditor and, an accountant, all recruited on a competitive basis15.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Budgeting&#13;
&#13;
6.      The activities and the breakdown of cost to be financed under the CITCAR have&#13;
been identified. Annual work plans to be approved by the Steering Committee will&#13;
clearly detail the activities and will be translated into annual budgets. The PCU will&#13;
monitor its execution with the integrated financial software, in accordance the budgeting&#13;
procedures specified in the manual of procedures, and will report on variances along with&#13;
the quarterly Interim Financial Monitoring Reports (IFRs). Basically, the PCU will&#13;
prepare the overall budgets on an annual basis. The budgeting system needs to forecast&#13;
the origin and use of funds under the project for each fiscal year. Only budgeted&#13;
expenditures would be committed and incurred so as to ensure resources are used within&#13;
the agreed upon allocations and for the intended purposes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Accounting policies and procedures&#13;
&#13;
7.     CAR is a member of OHADA organization, hence adheres to OHADA&#13;
accounting standards, so-called Syscohada, which are in line with the international&#13;
accounting standards. Hence Syscohada accounting standards will apply to this project.&#13;
A specific chart of accounts will be developed and documented in the manual of&#13;
procedures. A computerized accounting system is being purchased and will be&#13;
customized to record the PPF and the project's transactions and generate accurate&#13;
financial reports in time.&#13;
&#13;
Internal control and auditing:&#13;
&#13;
8.      Internal controls are yet to be put in place. The will comprise the whole systems&#13;
of control, financial or otherwise, established by management in order to (a) carry out the&#13;
15&#13;
     To date only the Procurement specialist and the financial manager have been hired&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      33&#13;
&amp;#12;project activities in an orderly and efficient manner; (b) ensure adherence to policies and&#13;
procedures; and (c) safeguard the assets of the project and secure as far as possible the&#13;
completeness and accuracy of the financial and other records. A PIM will document the&#13;
internal controls with a specific focus on the following: (i) segregation of duties; (ii)&#13;
physical control of assets; (iii) authorization and approval; (iv) clear channels of&#13;
command; (vi) arithmetic and accounting accuracy; (vii) integrity and performance of&#13;
staff at all levels; and (viii) supervision.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9.     An internal auditor acceptable to IDA will be competitively selected and&#13;
appointed to ensure full adherence to the procedures, pre-screen and clear all payments to&#13;
ensure they are supported by the following reliable evidences: (i) expenditures are&#13;
budgeted; (ii) the service is rendered according to the contract and (iii) the payment is&#13;
within the available budget allocation. Besides, the PCU will coordinate with the&#13;
"Inspection Générale des Finances" -IGF- to include this project in their annual audit&#13;
program and review it at least once a year. IGF audit report shall be communicated to the&#13;
PCU and the World Bank supervision missions.&#13;
&#13;
Financial Reporting:&#13;
&#13;
10.     The PCU is responsible of recording and reporting on all project transactions.&#13;
The financial manager located at the PCU will consolidate information and submit to the&#13;
World Bank an IFR on a quarterly basis and not later than 45 days after the end of each&#13;
calendar quarter. The IFR must include the following tables, with appropriate comments;&#13;
(i) Sources and Uses of Funds; (ii) Uses of Funds by Project Activity/Component; and&#13;
(iii) Special account activity statement&#13;
11.     At the end of each fiscal year, the project will issue the Project's Financial&#13;
Statements (PFS) comprising: (i) a balance sheet; (ii) a statement of sources and uses of&#13;
funds; (iii) accounting policies and procedures; and (iv) an explanatory notes. These PFS&#13;
will be subject to annual external audits as described below.&#13;
&#13;
External audit:&#13;
12.     The project annual financial statements will be audited by qualified external&#13;
auditors yet to be appointed. The audit reports comprising the audited financial&#13;
statements, a single audit opinion and a management letter will be submitted to IDA not&#13;
later than 6 months within the end of each fiscal year. These audits will be carried out in&#13;
accordance with the International Standards on Auditing (ISA). The audit TOR and&#13;
appointment of the external auditors will be agreed upon within 4 months after&#13;
effectiveness. The tentative due dates of the audit report will be as follow:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Disbursement arrangements and flow of funds&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13.    Flow of funds: One Designated Account in CFAF will be opened in a&#13;
commercial bank and managed by the PCU under the responsibility of the Project&#13;
coordinator and the financial manager. Upon effectiveness, the DA will receive an initial&#13;
deposit equivalent to four month expenditures forecast and will be replenished regularly&#13;
through monthly Withdrawal Applications cleared by the Internal Auditor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
14.    One DAs in CFAF (local currency) will be opened in local commercial Bank&#13;
acceptable to IDA with a ceiling of CFAF 186 million. This DA will be managed by the&#13;
PCU in terms of ensuring fiduciary standards and accordance with Bank FM guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
15.     No replenishment of the accounts will occur until the previous expenditures made&#13;
out of the process of the previous allocation have been properly documented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Allocation of Grant Proceeds:&#13;
&#13;
16.    The World Bank will issue a "Disbursement Letter" which will specify the&#13;
additional instructions for withdrawal of the proceeds of the Grant. The following table&#13;
shows the allocation of the proceeds of the Grant by disbursement category.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                  the exception of VAT)&#13;

                                                                                 the General Conditions&#13;
TOTAL AMOUNT                                                     7,300,000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Disbursement Methods:&#13;
&#13;
  17.     Given the high risk environment and the lack of familiarity with the Bank&#13;
  fiduciary procedures by the project staff, the report-based disbursement may not be&#13;
  applicable by default. Thus the transaction-based disbursement method will apply at the&#13;
  beginning. Once the PCU demonstrates its ability to submit reliable quarterly IFRs, the&#13;
  project may shift to the report-based method in the second year if it sustains a satisfactory&#13;
  FM rating. Other disbursement methods such as reimbursement, direct payment and&#13;
  special commitment may be applicable. The minimum value for Reimbursement, Direct&#13;
  Payment and Special Commitment will be 20 percent of the DA ceiling.&#13;
&#13;
  Types of Supporting Documentation&#13;
&#13;
  18.     The Bank requires either copies of the original documents evidencing eligible&#13;
  expenditures ("Records") or summary reports of expenditure ("Summary Reports").&#13;
  Disbursements will be supported by (i) Statement of Expenditures (SOE) summarizing&#13;
  eligible expenditures paid during a stated period for amounts below the SOE&#13;
  documentation threshold specified in the Disbursement Letter and (ii) records evidencing&#13;
  eligible expenditures (e.g. copies of receipts, supplier invoices). In all cases, the PCU&#13;
  will be responsible for retaining the original documents evidencing eligible expenditures&#13;
  and making them available for audit or inspection. Taxes: in line with Country Financing&#13;
  Parameters, the grant will finance 100% of eligible expenditures including taxes with the&#13;
  exception of the Value Added Tax (VAT) at the Recipient's request and as the financing&#13;
  of VAT would consume a significant share of projects costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      36&#13;
&amp;#12;Financial covenants&#13;
&#13;
19.     Financial covenants are the standard ones, as described in the legal documents,&#13;
and are comprised of maintaining project accounts in accordance with sound accounting&#13;
practices, audit requirements and records well kept and secured.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Conclusion and Supervision Plan&#13;
&#13;
20.     Currently the PCU does not have any FM system in place to manage the project.&#13;
Hence the overall FM risk is High at this point in time but the residual risk would be&#13;
Moderate provided the action plan below is implemented satisfactorily. On that basis and&#13;
in accordance with the risk-based approach, one (1) supervision mission will be carried&#13;
out in the first year once an acceptable FM system is effective at the PCU.&#13;

Procurement Environment&#13;
&#13;
1.     With IDA financial support, CAR has undertaken a reform of its procurement&#13;
system that led in June 2008 to the promulgation of a law on public procurement and&#13;
concession of public services. Although promulgated, this law is not yet enforced because&#13;
the application decrees are not yet ready. The 1961 law is still therefore in effect. This&#13;
system is characterized by:&#13;
           a. centralization ­ whereby all bids are issued by the Commission Nationale&#13;
               des Marchés chaired by the Minister of Finance and contracts are awarded&#13;
               by the Commission Nationale d'Attribution des Marchés de l'Etat chaired&#13;
               by an advisor at the Presidency; and&#13;
           b. slow processing in all phases of the procurement process (bid opening,&#13;
               analysis, approval and signing). Bids take as much as five months and&#13;
               sometimes more before they are opened. The decision to award contracts&#13;
               may itself take quite a long time. The consequences have been poor&#13;
               disbursement performance on all projects under implementation in the&#13;
               country.&#13;
&#13;
2.    Based on the current situation, it has been decided to establish a procurement&#13;
commission dedicated to the Project and established by a decision by the Prime Minister.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Guidelines&#13;
&#13;
Procurement for this project would be carried out in accordance with the World Bank&#13;
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004 and&#13;
revised in October 2006; and "Guidelines: Selection and Employment of Consultants by&#13;
World Bank Borrowers" dated May 2004 and revised in October 2006, and the provisions&#13;
stipulated in the Development Grant Agreement. The general description of various items&#13;
under different expenditure category is described below. For each contract to be financed&#13;
by the Grant, the different procurement (small works, goods and non-consulting services)&#13;
methods or consultant selection methods, prequalification, estimated costs, prior review&#13;
requirements, and time-frame would be agreed between the Recipient and the Bank Task&#13;
Team in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or&#13;
as required to reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in&#13;
institutional capacity. To the extent practicable The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents&#13;
for goods and Standard Requests for Proposals for Proposals as well as all standard&#13;
evaluation forms would be used throughout project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           38&#13;
&amp;#12;Publicity&#13;
&#13;
3.      A comprehensive General Procurement Notice (GPN) will be prepared by the&#13;
Borrower and published in the United Nations Development Business online (UNDB&#13;
online) and in the Development Gateway Market (dgMarket) following Board Approval,&#13;
to announce major consulting assignments and any ICB16. The GPN shall include all ICB&#13;
for goods contracts and all large consulting contracts (i.e., those estimated to cost&#13;
$200,000 or more). In addition, a specific procurement notice is required for all goods to&#13;
be procured under ICB in dgMarket and UNDB online. Requests for expressions of&#13;
interest for consulting services expected to cost more than $200,000 shall be advertised in&#13;
UNDB online and in dgMarket. An Expression of Interest (EOI) is required in the&#13;
national gazette or a national newspaper or in an electronic portal of free access for all&#13;
consulting firm services regardless of the contract amount. In the case of NCB17, a&#13;
specific procurement notice will be published in the national gazette or a national&#13;
newspaper or an electronic portal of free access. Contracts awards will also be published&#13;
in UNDB and dgMarket, in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines (para.&#13;
2.60) and Consultants Guidelines (para. 2.28).&#13;
&#13;
Works&#13;
&#13;
4.      No major works are foreseen under this project. Small works estimated to cost&#13;
less than $100,000 equivalent per contract may be procured through shopping, based on&#13;
price quotation obtained from at least three contractors in response to a written invitation&#13;
to qualified contractors.&#13;
&#13;
Goods&#13;
&#13;
5.      Goods procured under this Project would include vehicles, furniture and office&#13;
equipment. Taking into account (level of value added) manufactured/producers capacity&#13;
in the country, procurement of goods will be bulked where feasible (similar nature and&#13;
need at same time period) into bid packages of at least $500,000 valued, so that they can&#13;
be procured through suitable methods to secure competitive prices. The procurement will&#13;
be done using the Bank's SBD for all ICB. Goods estimated to cost $500,000 equivalent&#13;
and above per contract will be procured through ICB. For any others goods contracts cost&#13;
less than $500,000 equivalent, NCB procurement method in accordance with national&#13;
procedures can be used using Standard Bidding Document acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Procurement of readily available off-the-shelf goods that cannot be grouped into bid&#13;
packages of $100,000 or more may be procured through shopping in conformity with the&#13;
clause 3.5 of the procurement guidelines. At the beginning of the project implementation,&#13;
vehicles whose cost is estimated at less than $100 000 could be procured through UNOPS&#13;
or quotation.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement of non-consulting services&#13;
&#13;
6.      Non-Consulting services under this project include maintenance of the office&#13;
electronic equipment and other services such as printing, and editing. Non-Consulting&#13;
services are likely not to exceed the equivalent o f $100,000 per contract. Procurement of&#13;
&#13;
16&#13;
     ICB: International Competitive Bidding&#13;
17&#13;
     NCB: National Competitive Bidding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              39&#13;
&amp;#12;such services will be done using prudent shopping procedures in conformity with the&#13;
clause 3.5 of the procurement guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
Selection of consultants&#13;
&#13;
7.      Consulting services will be needed for the following activities: (i) technical&#13;
assistance, (ii) feasibility studies and any other critical studies, (iii) technical and&#13;
financial audit; environmental and social studies, etc.. These consulting services will be&#13;
procured with the most appropriate method among the following which are allowed by&#13;
Bank guidelines and included in the approved procurement plan: Quality-and Cost-Based&#13;
Selection (QCBS), Quality-Based Selection (QBS), Selection under a Fixed Budget&#13;
(SFB), Least-Cost Selection (LCS). Selection Based on Consultants' Qualifications (CQ)&#13;
will be used for assignments that shall not exceed $200,000. Single Source selection shall&#13;
also be used in accordance with the provisions of paragraphs 3.9 to 3.13 of the Consultant&#13;
Guidelines, with IDA's prior agreement. All terms of reference will be subject to IDA&#13;
prior review.&#13;
&#13;
8.     Short lists of consultants for services estimated to cost less than $100,000&#13;
equivalent per contract may be composed entirely of national consultants in accordance&#13;
with the provisions of paragraph 2.7 of the Consultant Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
9.      Assignments in excess of $200,000, and specialized technical assistance&#13;
assignments, must be procured on the basis of international short-lists after appropriate&#13;
advertisement in UNDB on line, DgMarket and in the national gazette or a national&#13;
newspaper or in an electronic portal of free access&#13;
&#13;
10.     Consultant for services meeting the requirements of section V of the consultant&#13;
guidelines, will be selected, under the provisions for the Selection of Individual&#13;
Consultants, through comparison of qualifications among candidates expressing interest&#13;
in the assignment or approached directly.&#13;
&#13;
Training, workshops and study tours&#13;
&#13;
11.     Participation in training sessions, workshops, seminars, conferences, and study&#13;
tours will be subject to the approved annual programs. The latter will identify the general&#13;
framework of training and similar activities for the year, including the nature of the&#13;
training, study tours, workshops, number of participants, as well as estimated costs.&#13;
&#13;
Operating costs&#13;
&#13;
12.     Operational costs, which will be financed by the project, would be procured using&#13;
the project's financial and administrative procedures manual previously agreed on by the&#13;
Bank. For efficiency purpose, operational furniture packages will be procured on the&#13;
basis of 6 or 12 months need and procured competitively. For services (car maintenance,&#13;
computers maintenance, etc.) to be financed through operational costs, the project will&#13;
proceed by service contracting for a defined period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            40&#13;
&amp;#12; B. Evaluation of the Borrower's capacity to award contracts in line with guidelines&#13;
&#13;
 13.     The PCU of the MPTNT will be responsible for the administration, coordination,&#13;
 monitoring of the Project, and procurement activities including compliance with&#13;
 procurement procedures. The PCU already includes a coordinator, a financial manager, a&#13;
 procurement specialist, an internal auditor and, an accountant, all to be recruited on a&#13;
 competitive basis (the procurement specialist and the financial specialist have been&#13;
 already hired). The assessment of the tenders boards of the ministries so far under World&#13;
 Bank financed projects have revealed: (i) an unfamiliarity of the members with bank's&#13;
 procurement procedures and, (ii) a weakness in the interpretation of Bank procurement&#13;
 procedures. As a result, appropriate capacity building program will be set for tender&#13;
 boards members. Based on weaknesses of the procurement activities, it has been decided&#13;
 to establish a CAB technical tenders board Commission placed under MPTNT's authority&#13;
 by the Prime Minister through a decision.&#13;
&#13;
 14.     An operation manual including the financial administrative arrangements with a&#13;
 detailed section on procurement is currently drafted in order to outline, among others, the&#13;
 procurement arrangement and the relevant procedures applicable to the management of&#13;
 the Grant.&#13;
&#13;
 15.     To ensure that the above mentioned procurement corrective measures will be met&#13;
 in due time, an action plan is proposed in the Table hereafter with tasks to be performed,&#13;
 responsible body as well as time-frame.&#13;
&#13;
 Schedule of actions to be carried out&#13;

                                                           procurement staff&#13;

                                              41&#13;
&amp;#12;16.    Procurement risk. The overall project risk for procurement is substantial because,&#13;
among other factors, there was no previous Bank operation with this ministry and the&#13;
PCU - with procurement responsibility - which is been set up and staffed, is a completely&#13;
new entity and is not familiar with procurement processes. Although procurement risk&#13;
rating is presently substantial, the above well designed action plan with mitigation&#13;
measures to be implemented and appropriate monitoring will reasonably bring this risk to&#13;
moderate.&#13;
&#13;
17.    The procurement process will be defined in the Decree establishing the CAB&#13;
technical tenders board Commission. It is the PCU responsibility to ensure that the&#13;
necessary national clearances and approvals have been received before the No-Objection&#13;
request is transmitted to the World Bank. Procurement steps that need review or/and&#13;
approval from particular tenders control boards, with respect to specific price thresholds,&#13;
will be defined in the Project's implementation manual and in the project procurement&#13;
plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Procurement plan&#13;
&#13;
18.     At appraisal, the Borrower has prepared a procurement plan for project&#13;
implementation providing the basis for the procurement methods. This plan, covering the&#13;
first 18 months of project implementation, has been discussed and agreed upon by the&#13;
Borrower and the project team at negotiations. It will be available in the Project's&#13;
database and a summary will be disclosed on the Bank's external website once the project&#13;
is approved by IDA Board of Executive Directors. The Procurement Plan will be updated&#13;
in agreement with the Project Team annually or as required to reflect the actual project&#13;
implementation needs and improvement in institutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
Publication of Results and Debriefing.&#13;
&#13;
19.     Publication of results of the bidding process is required for all ICBs, LIBs and&#13;
Direct Contracting. Publication should take place as soon as the no objection is received,&#13;
except for Direct Contracting which may be done quarterly and in a simplified format.&#13;
Publication of results for NCB and Shopping should follow the requirements of the&#13;
procurement code of CAR. The disclosure of results is also required for selection of&#13;
consultants. All consultants competing for the assignment should be informed of the&#13;
result of the technical evaluation (number of points that each firm received) before the&#13;
opening of the financial proposals, and at the end of the selection process the results&#13;
should be published. The publication of results in selection of consultants applies to all&#13;
methods, however for CQS and SSS the publication may be done quarterly and in a&#13;
simplified format. The publication may be done through Client Connection. Losing&#13;
bidders/consultants shall be debriefed on the reasons why they were not awarded the&#13;
contract if they request explanation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            42&#13;
&amp;#12;Fraud, Coercion and Corruption&#13;
&#13;
20.    The procuring entity as well as Bidders/Suppliers/Contractors shall observe the&#13;
highest standard of ethics during the procurement and execution of contracts financed&#13;
under the program in accordance with paragraphs 1.15 &amp; 1.16 of the Procurement&#13;
Guidelines and paragraphs 1.25 &amp; 1.26 of the Consultants Guidelines.&#13;
&#13;
C. Frequency of procurement supervision&#13;
&#13;
21.    The capacity assessment recommended that supervision missions and field visits&#13;
by the World Bank should take place at least twice a year.&#13;
&#13;
D. Performance Technical audit&#13;
&#13;
22.     The project financing and activities under the CITCAR will be subject to&#13;
technical audits. These should be conducted, at 100 percent contracts on an annual basis&#13;
by independent auditors recruited by the PCU. During the execution of the Project and up&#13;
to two years after the closing date of the Grant Agreement, all documentation with&#13;
respect to each activity carried shall be kept by the borrower for review and examination..&#13;

1.     Economic and financial analysis with a focus on connectivity. An assessment&#13;
study for backbone connectivity was conducted with the help of international consultants&#13;
in several CAB eligible countries, including CAR.. A preliminary economic and&#13;
financial analysis was carried out based on this study, and yielding the results outlined&#13;
below.&#13;
&#13;
2.      The aim of CAB APL 1 (APL1A including CITCM, CITCAR and CITCD and&#13;
APL 1B) is to establish a regional broadband network across Cameroon, CAR and Chad.&#13;
This broadband network will reduce significantly the cost of international connectivity.&#13;
This will have a direct economic impact through additional investment, value added, and&#13;
employment and as a generator of tax revenues. It will also have an indirect economic&#13;
impact through increased productivity of the public and private sectors (e.g. improved&#13;
public service delivery).&#13;

3.     The opportunity cost was calculated to measure the global economies from&#13;
the cost of providing bandwidth relying on Satellite connection as compared to the&#13;
cost of providing bandwidth relying on CAB connection. As suggested in the table&#13;
below under the assumption of a discount rate of 13 percent and an average annual&#13;
decrease of 8 percent for satellite connection, the actual opportunity cost is estimated at&#13;
more than $117 million: $34 million for Cameroon, $26 million for CAR and 58 million&#13;
for Chad.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                               46&#13;
&amp;#12;                                            Total discounted opportunity cost&#13;
                               Chad                       $58&#13;
                            Cameroon                      $34&#13;
                                CAR                       $26&#13;
                                CAB                      $117&#13;
4.       The estimated opportunity cost is a decreasing function of the annual decrease in&#13;
satellite connection prices An average annual decrease of 21.6 percent of satellite&#13;
connection prices between 2011 and 2021 would jeopardize the competitiveness of the&#13;
CAB Program and would therefore produce a 0 (zero) opportunity cost.&#13;
&#13;
5.     The CAB Program in general will provide a major boost to the broadband market&#13;
through increasing usage of broadband in public institutions, in the private sector and for&#13;
consumers. CAB APL 1 will significantly reduce the cost of international connectivity.&#13;
The project will stimulate the market and the overall economy. The effect of the project is&#13;
therefore to accelerate the development of the broadband market. It is estimated the&#13;
backbone will carry more that 23,000 E1 in 2021.&#13;

&#13;
6.      The estimates of economic impact are based on a 10 year model of the&#13;
broadband market in Cameroon, CAR and Chad. Broadband Internet is a new&#13;
industry in Africa and there are very few countries with advanced broadband markets on&#13;
which to base economic calculations. The economic impact is based on a micro-&#13;
economic analysis calculating the social welfare as the sum of the consumer surplus and&#13;
producer surplus. The consumer surplus is calculated as the amount that consumers&#13;
benefit by being able to purchase a product for a price that is less than they would be&#13;
willing to pay. The producer surplus is computed as amount that producers benefit by&#13;
selling at a market price mechanism that is higher than they would be willing to sell for.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Central African
            Backbone Program Communications and Infrastructure
            Technology Adaptable Program Loan (APL) Project is to
            contribute to increase geographical reach and usage of
            regional broadband network services and reduce their prices.
            There are two components to the project, the first component
            being enabling environment. This component will finance
            various activities in the form of technical assistance (TA),
            training and equipments in order to: (i) modernize the
            Information and Communication Technology (ICT) policy,
            legal, and regulatory environment; (ii) strengthen key
            public institutions; and (iii) promote a pro-competitive
            environment and restructure of Incumbent operators. This
            component is a key for the effective establishment of the
            Central African backbone network. Finally, the second
            component is the project management capability. This
            component will consist in financing project management
            related issues. It will support the following activities:
            (a) consultants to staff the Project Coordination Unit (PCU)
            (i.e., a procurement specialist, a financial manager, an
            internal auditor, an accountant, and a backbone expert); (b)
            equipments (i.e., financial management system); (c) various
            TA; (d) training; and (e) operating expenses.
