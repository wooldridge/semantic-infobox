TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
1. ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT ISSUES IN INDIA&#13;
1.   Introduction. Each of the individual Bank-IDA assisted projects noted in Schedule A&#13;
of the Memorandum of the President, includes institutional development/capacity building&#13;
components, which are designed to enhance the capabilities of various State Departments of&#13;
Environment and Forests and associated institutions, State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs),&#13;
parastatal organizations, and private institutions to better manage the environmental&#13;
dimensions of specific investment programs. The Environmental Assessment processes of&#13;
both the Bank (Operational Directive 4.01) and Govermnent of India (GOI) (Environmental&#13;
Impact Assessment of Development Projects Notification 1994) have meant that Category A&#13;
and B projects (water resources, forestry, infrastructure) have included the preparation and&#13;
implementation of Environmental Management Plans (EMP). However, despite the&#13;
impressive record of the Bank and GOI collaboration on the environment, gaps remain in the&#13;
support strategy. The Enviromnent Action Program - India (EAP) Review (paras. 13-14 of&#13;
the MOP) has also demonstrated that, while other bilateral and multilateral donors provide&#13;
assistance to GOI over the range of its seven environmental priorities, there remains an&#13;
unfinished agenda, particularly as regards strengthening the capacities of existing institutions&#13;
to plan, monitor, and strengthen compliance with the environmental laws and standards of the&#13;
country, i.e. environmental management.&#13;
2.    Environmental management is a continuous process that consists of three&#13;
interconnected steps: (a) the collection and analysis of relevant data; learning from worldwide&#13;
"best practices"; and incorporating these in the planning and formulation of policy including&#13;
the setting of standards; (b) the effectiveness and location of the administration of&#13;
environmental institutions; and (c) program implementation and monitoring to ensure active&#13;
compliance with established laws and standards.&#13;
3.    An assessment of India's environmental management system suggests that weaknesses&#13;
are evident at each of the three main steps and every administrative level i.e. center, state, and&#13;
district (municipality and panchayat). Further, despite the support provided by the Bank and&#13;
other donors under specific investment projects, more needs to be done in the areas of air&#13;
pollution, coastal zone management, urban land use including industrial siting, and mitigating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
environmental degradation in the mining sector. Outlined below is a discussion of the major&#13;
generic issues of environmental management which are manifest at each administrative level.&#13;
A. ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY PLANNING&#13;
4.    Environmental management from central government institutions, particularly the&#13;
Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) and its Regional Offices, and the Central&#13;
Pollution Control Board (CPCB), is plagued by several problems. These range from weak data&#13;
management which affects policy planning and implementation, to overlapping functions and&#13;
jurisdictions because of the wide range of environmental legislation.&#13;
5.    Environmental Research has received special attention since 1974, when the&#13;
National Committee on Environmental Planning and Coordination initiated a scheme for&#13;
developing skilled individuals to confront India's environmental challenges. A further impetus&#13;
to environmental research occurred with the establishment of a Research Division of the&#13;
MOEF in 1985. A process evolved during this period for soliciting screening, and funding&#13;
research from universities, industry, and other members of the scientific community.&#13;
Research proposals are invited in two ways, i.e. either through the member institutions of the&#13;
Council for Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) or by invitations from the Ministry in&#13;
newspapers. The Environmental Research Committee (ERC) charged with screening and&#13;
recommending proposals for funding was instituted by MOEF's predecessor National&#13;
Committee on Environmental Planning and Coordination during the Fourth Five-Year Plan&#13;
(1969-74). The ERC has 20 members, 14 of whom, including the chairman, are members of&#13;
the scientific community and six represent the MOEF and other ministries. Requests for&#13;
proposals have a generic format only, and do not specify guidelines for the research design,&#13;
methodology, data treatment or applicability of the findings. Priorities have not been&#13;
established among the physical, chemical, and biological features of environmental resources&#13;
or the economic and social considerations associated with their use, conservation, protection,&#13;
and management. Environmental research is supported under three broad categories: Man&#13;
and Biosphere (MAB); the Environment Research Program (ERP); and Action-Oriented&#13;
Research for the Eastern and Western Ghats. About 200 research projects are underway in&#13;
any given year, with about 90 being newly funded. ERP principally covers the "Brown&#13;
Agenda" and has received 60% of the annual Rs. 38.5 million budget over the past two years;&#13;
1994-95 included 31 ERP projects.&#13;
6.    The MOEF Research Division is not equipped to manage a focused national&#13;
environment research program. The process for inviting proposals, screening and&#13;
recommending projects for support is non-thematic, institution driven rather than national&#13;
priority driven, and unsystematic. Since its inception, it has not changed to accommodate new&#13;
policies and priorities. The research community, or a large percentage of it, is not&#13;
professionally prepared to propose and carry out scientific research, as evidenced by the fact&#13;
that approximately 60% of the 1,000 research projects proposed for 1994-95 are inadequate in&#13;
their research methodology (no testable hypothesis or professionally acceptable data treatment&#13;
and analyses) or application to national environmental problems. The MOEF research effort&#13;
operates in isolation from other environmental research undertaken both in other sectors and&#13;
abroad. This results in the replication of non-India specific research, as well as the dilution of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
India's available research funds by supporting proposals already underway or which have&#13;
been completed elsewhere.&#13;
7.    Environmental Information. There is a consensus that the lack of good quality&#13;
environmental data is a major problem of environmental management in India. There are two&#13;
aspects to this shortcoming: the existence of adequate data, which is essentially a problem of&#13;
resources and strategic planning in primary data collection; and the availability of, or access&#13;
to, adequate data, which is primarily related to database management, and the legal right of&#13;
access by potential users. Underlying both problems are issues related to technology and&#13;
resources, unclear institutional mandates, and unclear uses of the data which is collected.&#13;
Given India's size and complexity, information collection and database management must be&#13;
decentralized, both in terms of geographic coverage and thematic area. Although incomplete&#13;
in its implementation, this approach has generally been adopted in India. The data collection&#13;
and management system has three parts:&#13;
a) Collectors of primary data, such as State Pollution Control Boards,&#13;
universities/institutes, and NGOs. Common problems in the collection of primary&#13;
data are reliability, adequate resources and insufficient exchange between&#13;
collectors and end users results in low usage rates of existing data and widespread&#13;
dissatisfaction by potential end users at the lack of data.&#13;
b) Thematic data centers, such as the Environment Information System (ENVIS)&#13;
centers of the MOEF that collect primary data from all available sources, and&#13;
attempt to make it available to queries from both the government and the public.&#13;
To date, however, the ENVIS centers have had inadequate resources, technology,&#13;
and skills to maintain well managed and widely accessible environmental&#13;
databases. An important first step towards addressing these shortcomings is a&#13;
proposed UNDP/IDRC project entitled "Establishment of a Sustainable&#13;
Development Networking Program," which is scheduled to begin in early 1996.&#13;
c) Data end users, include government bodies such as the MOEF and CPCB, state&#13;
environment departments, and the district-level planning committees, and outside&#13;
users, such as academia, business, the media, and NGOs.  In the case of&#13;
government, current data-driven decision support systems are generally in&#13;
rudimentary form, and as a result, do not provide accurate and timely data. To&#13;
improve these systems, attention must be given to: (i) data needs for decision-&#13;
making; and (ii) the technology required to meet those needs. The resolution of&#13;
these questions must be tailored to each decision-making body. Furthermore, the&#13;
data needs of these important end users should be communicated back up the data&#13;
management system--to the primary collection and thematic data centers--in order&#13;
to make the entire system more efficient.&#13;
8.    Environmental Economics is relatively new throughout the world, but has its deepest&#13;
roots in the resource economics traditions in developed countries. Much of the current&#13;
literature in environmental economics builds on the mistakes and inefficiencies of 1960s and&#13;
1970s environmental policies adopted in the United States, Europe, and Japan. For example,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
the magnitude of industrial investment diverted in these countries to large, rapid, end-of-pipe&#13;
pollution control equipment in the early 1970s could not be done today in the developing&#13;
countries without an unacceptable negative impact on growth. Therefore, alternative&#13;
approaches to environmental management have evolved that reduce the financial cost to&#13;
society of improved environmental management, while securing much higher economic,&#13;
environmental, and social benefits.&#13;
9.    The environmental community in India, particularly those concerned with pollution&#13;
issues, is dominated by environmental engineers. Professionals trained in environmental&#13;
economics are under-represented, and the economic dimension of policy decisions taken by&#13;
government environment agencies often neglect viable and cost-effective policy options. As a&#13;
result, the cost-effectiveness of measures being proposed and implemented is inadequately&#13;
analyzed, needlessly expensive, and inefficient policies sometimes result. Two current&#13;
examples are: (a) the heavy over-reliance on command and control approaches to industrial&#13;
pollution control, in spite of widespread findings in other countries that a more "mixed&#13;
policy" approach, utilizing industry compliance incentives through economic instruments,&#13;
public disclosure, and voluntary programs, can achieve greater pollution abatement at a far&#13;
lower cost; and (b) the recent introduction of catalytic converters on automobiles, which is one&#13;
of the least cost-effective of many steps available to address urban air pollution in New Delhi&#13;
and elsewhere.&#13;
10.   Environmental Indicators and Indices.  A former Minister of Population and&#13;
Environment of an Asian country is reported to have remarked in 1986: "In my policy making&#13;
I need an indicator in money terms for losses in environment and resources as a counterweight&#13;
to the indicator for production, namely national income. If a theoretically sound indicator is&#13;
not possible, then think up one that is rather less theoretically sound." Increasing global&#13;
concerns about the environment in the 1970s has led many governments and international&#13;
institutions such as the Bank to initiate efforts to develop standard and transparent&#13;
methodologies to assess the impact of economic development on environmental quality. The&#13;
economic liberalization in India in the 1 990s has stimulated rapid economic growth especially&#13;
in coastal states like Gujarat and Maharashtra. This fast growth requires massive investments&#13;
in energy (coal) production and in other infrastructure sectors. These investments tend to have&#13;
profound environmental implications which must be properly assessed in order to maintain&#13;
that the investments are at least environmentally neutral or, if possible, environmentally&#13;
beneficial. Because India is a very large country with a diverse ecological and socioeconomic&#13;
environment, and has not yet developed such indicators and mainstreamed them as part of&#13;
their natural economic management, it makes the assessment of the environmental impacts of&#13;
economic growth all the more necessary and complex.&#13;
11.   Environmental Standards in any country must balance the costs and benefits of firm-&#13;
level emissions standards, ambient concentration standards, and standards imposed on&#13;
municipal facilities, such as waste-water treatment plants, off-shore out-takes, or land-fills.&#13;
All of these pose difficult issues, and implicit economic, environmental, and social trade-offs.&#13;
Standards are best assessed in light of good data on the average cost of compliance and of&#13;
local ambient conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
municipalities trying to comply with such standards, it is appropriate that standards face&#13;
periodic review and updating. For example, under the recently approved Bombay Sewage&#13;
Disposal Project, the environmental assessment process concluded that GOI's bacterial&#13;
standard for effluent discharge in coastal waters was unnecessarily stringent when compared&#13;
to standards in the European Union and United States. GOI has agreed that by June 1997, it&#13;
will establish revised water quality standards, applicable to the discharge of wastewater to&#13;
marine coastal waters. This suggests that a more general review of the appropriateness of&#13;
national standards and some of the existing legislation may be necessary to bring them in line&#13;
with current acceptable standards and practice.&#13;
B. ENVIRONMENTAL ADMINISTRATION&#13;
13.   Regional Offices of MOEF. The Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) Bill, 1994,&#13;
states that any new project or expansion of any existing project would require an evaluation&#13;
and assessment by the MOEF (Impact Assessment Agency Cell) (Attachment A paras. 16-23).&#13;
Currently, the MOEF reviews the applications and issues relevant orders. The Regional&#13;
Offices are required to monitor the conditions under which clearances are given. It is evident&#13;
that follow-up and monitoring of projects cleared under the EIA notification has to be&#13;
undertaken jointly by the Regional Offices and the SPCBs. There are instances when the&#13;
SPCBs and the MOEF adopt different standards under the Air and Water Pollution&#13;
(Prevention) Control Acts in respect of the same projects, while giving clearances. The system&#13;
of monitoring also needs improvement, as it is not based on automatic and on-line monitoring&#13;
of critical equipment and processes, but based on periodic reports prepared by the units.&#13;
MOEF is concerned about systematic follow-up of cases cleared under the EIA and the&#13;
environmental audit processes, has made it an important function of its Regional Offices&#13;
(Attachment B para. 4), and has created posts of scientists in all Regional Offices. It is also&#13;
clear that the standard of the EIAs varies from region to region and from agency to agency.&#13;
Even though the Notification lays down that all necessary information must be furnished by&#13;
the industries and the project authorities, in many cases, the EIAs are of inferior quality and&#13;
that makes quick and effective assessment difficult. NEERI has attempted to streamline the&#13;
EIA process and has held some training programs in this regard.&#13;
14.   Presently, the Regional Offices are ill-equipped in manpower and supportive&#13;
infrastructure to carry out the mandate given to or expected of them. For example, out of&#13;
3,443 forestry projects cleared, the Regional Offices could monitor only 2,034 projects up to&#13;
March 31, 1995. Out of 1,175 environmental clearances, only 851 could be monitored in the&#13;
same period. In states like Maharashtra and Gujarat, out of 139 and 78 environmental&#13;
clearances respectively, only 67 and 35 cases could actually be monitored in the same period.&#13;
15.   The present location of the Regional Offices makes it difficult for them to discharge&#13;
their functions effectively. For example, the Regional Office at Bhopal is incapable of giving&#13;
adequate attention to the large-scale industrialization and consequent potential adverse&#13;
impacts on the environment which is underway in Maharashtra and Gujarat. Similarly, the&#13;
Regional Office at Bangalore cannot supervise ongoing activities in Andhra Pradesh, Tamil&#13;
Nadu, Karnataka, Goa, Kerala and the territory of Pondicherry. While increased threats to the&#13;
environment are being matched by the enactment of an increasing amount of legislation, the&#13;
responsibilities of the various agencies, including the Regional Offices, have not been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
Nadu, Karnataka, Goa, Kerala and the territory of Pondicherry. While increased threats to the&#13;
environment are being matched by the enactment of an increasing amount of legislation, the&#13;
responsibilities of the various agencies, including the Regional Offices, have not been&#13;
properly defined. In many instances, there are overlapping rules, in terms of compliance with&#13;
environmental regulations under different agencies by the same unit. Lastly, the Regional&#13;
Offices are not equipped to deal with specific environmental problems in the regions. For&#13;
example, while the Western Regional Office should have expertise in dealing with the&#13;
environmental consequences arising out of coastal pollution and chemical industries, the&#13;
Eastern Regional Office should have expertise in coal and other mining.&#13;
C. DECENTRALIZATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
16.   The National Environment Awareness Campaign (NEAC) was created in 1986 to&#13;
stimulate environmental awareness at all levels of society. The strategy is to fund a wide&#13;
variety of activities within existing government and non-government organizations. During&#13;
1994-95 for example, over 2,200 organizations including NGOs, schools, colleges,&#13;
universities, research institutions, women and youth organizations, army units and other&#13;
government departments, were provided funds to undertake awareness activities. These&#13;
activities were as varied as the organizations involved, and ranged from training courses,&#13;
seminars, workshops and public meetings to rallies, exhibitions, essay competitions, debate&#13;
and poster contests, folk dances and street theater. Activities also included the production and&#13;
distribution of environmental education resource materials.&#13;
17.   NEAC activities are organized through 20 selected organizations called Regional&#13;
Resource Agencies (RRA), chosen in part by their geographic location. The RRAs identify&#13;
NGOs and other organizations in their region, screen them, and consistent with the year's&#13;
campaign theme advertise and invite proposals, i.e. the 1994-95 themes were "Joint Forest&#13;
Management, Ecodevelopment and the Montreal Protocol"; the 1995-96 theme is "Women&#13;
and the Environment". The RRAs forward their recommended proposals for funding to the&#13;
MOEF, where an Empowered Committee further selects, recommends, and submits for final&#13;
approval to higher MOEF authorities. Five MOEF Centers of Excellence support&#13;
environmental awareness activities of NEAC and other programs such as the school-based&#13;
Eco Clubs, as well as carry out research and training in environmental education. The&#13;
activities of these Centers also include formal environmental education courses, publications,&#13;
public service video spots, exhibitions, and task force reports on specific topics of&#13;
environmental concern.&#13;
18.   The NEAC has served as the primary general environmental awareness strategy and&#13;
has evolved in parallel to other environmental awareness and education initiatives. The extent&#13;
to which the Indian population has been made aware of environmental issues is unknown, but&#13;
the number of community-based activities carried out during the past ten years is persuasive&#13;
that the campaign has reached a wide segment of the population. However, ten years of&#13;
mainly the same awareness activities to the same audiences by essentially the same entities&#13;
should also indicate that the time has come for a review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
19.   NEACs and parallel non-formal environmental education initiatives might be more&#13;
effective if linked, if action-oriented elements were included, and if focused on specific&#13;
populations and environmental issues. NEAC might be more effective if orchestrated with&#13;
new organizations responsible for managing, monitoring, and compliance enforcement of&#13;
environmental concerns at the district, town panchayat, and village levels.&#13;
20.   The Paryavaran Vahini Program was launched in 1992-93 as an adjunct to the&#13;
National Environment Awareness Campaign. The objective is to involve community&#13;
members, not only in awareness, but also to empower them to identify and report&#13;
environmental hazards and activities detrimental to their immediate living and working areas.&#13;
One hundred eighty-three districts have been selected in 25 states and four union territories for&#13;
the establishment of Paryavaran Vahinis or environmental brigades because of the high&#13;
incidence of pollution, density of forest, and tribal populations. As of January 1996, one&#13;
hundred and thirty have been constituted, and forty more have been authorized but not yet&#13;
established.&#13;
21.   The support system for the Paryavaran Vahinis includes a training program for&#13;
District Collectors which is carried out by the Regional Offices of MOEF and instructional&#13;
materials designed and produced by MOEF's Centers of Excellence. The 130 established&#13;
Paryavaran Vahinis each have twenty members, selected from within the district by a Joint&#13;
Committee from MOEF's Regional Office and district leaders. These 2,600 Paryavaran&#13;
Vahini members receive a Rs. 200 stipend per month for honorarium and expenses. They have&#13;
a violation reporting form which they submit to the District Collector at monthly meetings.&#13;
The District Collector in turn, is expected to follow-up on the complaints and submit them for&#13;
resolution to other authorities. The District Collector submits a quarterly report to MOEF's&#13;
Regional Office which includes the number of complaints received and the action taken on&#13;
each complaint. Although it is possible to increase membership of the Vahinis up to 100&#13;
members, lack of funding has not allowed an increase even in large geographic and populous&#13;
districts with a high potential for violations. The Paryavaran Vahini scheme is a stand-alone&#13;
activity and parallels another district-based grass-roots action scheme led by Forestry officials,&#13;
the Van Mukhi. In addition, relationships have not been established between the Paryavaran&#13;
Vahini district groups and NGOs working for environmental awareness in the same&#13;
communities under the NEAC. Expansion and improvement would require review of selection&#13;
and training practices, improvement of support budgets including Vahini incentives for&#13;
member exemplary performance, and infrastructure and training support for State&#13;
Departments of Environment to assume their proper leadership role.&#13;
22.   The Paryavaran Vahini scheme has not been orchestrated with District-level planning&#13;
and Panchayat structured environmental management initiatives. Paryavaran Vahinis have&#13;
not been linked with other environmental awareness programs, despite some association by&#13;
Vahini members' with local environmental NGOs. The success of the Paryavaran Vahini&#13;
project is based on three fragile premises, that: (a) the District Collector or his appointee, has&#13;
both the time to be trained as well as the ability to train twenty or more district-wide&#13;
community members; (b) the trained (for two days) members can knowledgeably identify and&#13;
report environmental hazards and violations; and (c) the District Collector or his appointee has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
oversee, train, and follow-up with 27 district Vahinis spread over five states and two union&#13;
territories. The process, results, strengths and shortcomings of the Paryavaran Vahini scheme&#13;
are clear.&#13;
D. IMPLEMENTATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL LAW&#13;
24.   Environmental Law. India has an extensive framework of environmental law. Its&#13;
legislative commitment to environmental policy objectives is highlighted by the inclusion of&#13;
provisions in its Constitution. This represents an extent of legislative commitment rare in&#13;
international experience. In addition, some decisions of Indian courts have provided&#13;
recognition of environmental rights which is more extensive than in most countries (e.g., the&#13;
recognition of the right to environment as an inherent part of the right to life under the&#13;
Constitution). Although there are issues that remain to be addressed relating to the adequacy&#13;
of the substantive coverage of laws and the coordination among existing laws and regulations,&#13;
the main legal issue to be addressed at this time is strengthening implementation of existing&#13;
laws.&#13;
25.   Industrial pollution is among the main concerns, be it due to large-scale or small-scale&#13;
industries. In this context, the main environmental laws that fail to be implemented in India&#13;
relate to water and air pollution (the Water Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974 and&#13;
related laws; The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1987 and related laws; and&#13;
the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. Each law has an extensive body of regulations&#13;
(Attachment 1 paras. 4-27). There are four main legal factors contributing to poor&#13;
implementation:&#13;
(a)   inadequate  processes  for environmental decision-making  and  dispute&#13;
resolution: Legal literature recognizes that compliance is an integral part of the&#13;
process of bargaining by which individuals and groups gain access to&#13;
resources. Effective compliance is largely dependent on the extent to which&#13;
decision-making processes take into account and reflect the interests of affected&#13;
groups. An important function of environmental law should be the provision of&#13;
a process by which decisions relating to use of environmental resources are&#13;
taken in a manner that provides a full accounting of all interests and costs and&#13;
benefits. It should also provide a process to prevent, mitigate or intermediate&#13;
environmental conflicts in an orderly fashion. The Indian environmental law&#13;
framework does not presently provide and effective process for&#13;
bargaining/negotiations among affected groups, or resolution of conflicts.&#13;
Consequently, disputes are often either resolved through intervention of the&#13;
judiciary in constitutional litigation, or sometimes result in conflicts that could&#13;
be avoided through a more inclusive and community-oriented system of&#13;
decision-making and dispute resolution;&#13;
(b)   absence of non-litigation remedies for affected persons/communities, resulting&#13;
in excessive reliance on litigation, including constitutional, public interest&#13;
litigation. Reliance on litigation not only places a burden on the court system,&#13;
but is also often not accessible by all segments of affected or interested groups.&#13;
&#13;

9&#13;
judiciary in constitutional litigation, or sometimes result in conflicts that could&#13;
be avoided through a more inclusive and community-oriented system of&#13;
decision-making and dispute resolution;&#13;
(b)   absence of non-litigation remedies for affected persons/communities, resulting&#13;
in excessive reliance on litigation, including constitutional, public interest&#13;
litigation. Reliance on litigation not only places a burden on the court system,&#13;
but is also often not accessible by all segments of affected or interested groups.&#13;
(c)   insufficient legal infrastructure in the MOEF and in the CPCB and SPCBs, for&#13;
implementation; weak dissemination of law and the decisions made thereunder;&#13;
insufficient monitoring of compliance because of lack of monitoring tools and&#13;
technical and legal capacity to review compliance; inadequate capacity for&#13;
effective inspection and for taking remedial actions including follow up in&#13;
courts; and lack of required continuing legal training; and&#13;
(d)   inadequate use of community and non-govermnental resources, and customary&#13;
law in implementation. Given the size and diversity of India and the scale of&#13;
the problems, even a large expansion of bureaucratic capacity is unlikely to&#13;
have a significant impact of results on the ground. A legal strategy has not yet&#13;
been developed for employing India's vast and ancient social institutions and&#13;
traditions, including its essentially "green" and "eco-friendly" customary law&#13;
traditions, in the task of environmental protection. Such a strategy could be&#13;
implemented within the existing legal framework, and with minimal additional&#13;
resource needs.&#13;
E. MONITORING AND COMPLIANCE IN SPECIFIC HIGH PRIORITY PROBLEM AREAS&#13;
26.   Mining Sector. Mining projects, one of the 29 sectors listed in the Schedule-I of the&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) Notification of 1994, require environmental and site&#13;
clearances from the MOEF. An exclusive Environmental Appraisal Committee of experts,&#13;
constituted by the MOEF, appraises a large number of mining projects every year. During&#13;
1994, MOEF received 510 projects for environmental and site appraisal, of which 366 (68%)&#13;
were mining projects (46 for environmental and 320 for site clearances)' As per the EIA&#13;
Notification, the Forest Conservation Act of 1980, and the Mining and Minerals Regulating&#13;
and Development Act, iron, coal, zinc, copper, and aluminum, are declared as major minerals.&#13;
Mining projects involving more than five hectares of land are required to obtain&#13;
environmental and site clearances from the MOEF. Projects involving minor minerals, such&#13;
as granite, and marble, and major mineral mining projects requiring leases of less than five&#13;
hectares of land are given environmental clearances by the concerned state Mining and&#13;
Geology Department and Department of Environment and Forests.&#13;
IAnnual Report 1994-95; Ministry of Environment and Forests&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
27.   The Regional Offices of MOEF monitor the compliance of the Environmental&#13;
Management Plans (EMP) of projects cleared by the MOEF. Similarly, the respective state&#13;
Departments of Environment are responsible for monitoring the compliance of EMPs of the&#13;
mining projects which they cleared. State Pollution Control Boards monitor the compliance&#13;
with the existing water and air pollution emission standards and issue the annual 'consent to&#13;
operate' approval to the mines cleared by both the Central and State Governments. The Zonal&#13;
Offices of the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) compile the ambient air and water&#13;
quality data for the CPCB. State Pollution Control Boards, on specific request in a few cases,&#13;
provide assistance to the Regional Offices of MOEF in monitoring the compliance of EMPs.&#13;
Under the Major Mineral Conservation Rules of GOI, the Indian Bureau of Mines issues&#13;
licenses for mining major minerals other than coal (coal mines are handled by the Coal Board)&#13;
and approves five-year mining plans. State Governments have their own respective Minor&#13;
Mineral Conservation Rules and their respective Mining and Geology Departments issue&#13;
licenses for mining minor minerals and approve five-year mining plans.&#13;
28.   Recognizing the adverse environmental impacts and the need for developing remedial&#13;
measures that are specific to the mining sector, the MOEF established in 1987, a Center for&#13;
Mining Environment at Dhanbad in Bihar. The main objective of this Center is to generate&#13;
scientific data and build national capacity for sustainable mining in the country. The Center&#13;
conducts post graduate and doctoral level courses, as well as training programs for in-service&#13;
professionals. Research areas include land use management, noise and vibration problems in&#13;
2&#13;
mining areas, air pollution in fire areas and its effect on health. Coal India Ltd. produces&#13;
over 90% of India's coal requirement. As part of a separate proposed FY96 World Bank-&#13;
assisted Coal India Environrnental and Social Mitigation Project, the in-house capacity of&#13;
Coal India and its Central Mine Planning and Design Institute (CMPDI) at Ranchi will be&#13;
strengthened to develop environmentally benign designs for coal mining.&#13;
29.   As described above, several agencies--Indian Bureau of Mines and MOEF at the&#13;
center, Mining and Geology Departments and Departments of Environment in the states, and&#13;
Panchayats at the local level, are involved in clearing mining projects. This situation often&#13;
results in conflicting approaches and procedures in giving site and environmental clearances.&#13;
Also, multiple agencies (state Departments of Environment, Mining and Geology&#13;
Departments, and State Pollution Control Boards for minor mineral projects, and MOEF, and&#13;
Indian Bureau of Mines for major mineral projects) are responsible for overseeing compliance&#13;
of EMPs. The result is that compliance is poor because of the ambiguous roles of the various&#13;
regulatory agencies in the mining sector, and each state government having its own&#13;
procedures for regulating mining and its environmental impacts. Each State Pollution Control&#13;
Board has its own rules and environmental standards for the mining sector. Some State&#13;
Pollution Control Boards do not monitor mining projects at all, and some have even exempted&#13;
these projects from applying for the "consent to operate". Even those State Pollution Control&#13;
Boards which issue "consent to operate" and collect "water cess fees", monitor the compliance&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
of air and water pollution standards only. They do not monitor compliance of other&#13;
appropriate mitigation measures for environmental protection.&#13;
30.   Inadequate capacity in State Pollution Control Boards and MOEF Regional Offices is&#13;
common across the country. Lack of expertise in environmental planning and monitoring of&#13;
mining projects as well as an inadequate number of professional staff are the major problems.&#13;
In some Regional Offices each staff is assigned a large territory with several hundred mining&#13;
projects. Staff are normally trained to deal only with industrial air and water pollution&#13;
control, with the result that the major environmental concerns of mining, such as land&#13;
degradation, hydrology, and so on, do not receive adequate attention.&#13;
31.   Laxity in addressing the impacts of minor mineral mining projects is another common&#13;
issue. The state Departments of Environment and Departments of Mining and Geology do not&#13;
have in-house capacity to clear the minor minerals projects and to monitor compliance of&#13;
agreed EMPs. Also, most State Pollution Control Boards have exempted these mining projects&#13;
from applying for a "consent to operate" and do not monitor or enforce any environmental&#13;
standards. At present, there is not much networking among the various institutions responsible&#13;
for regulating mining and related environmental impacts. There is a little coordination and&#13;
exchange of information/experiences among the mining institutions and the different&#13;
Government agencies responsible for issuing clearances. Also, there is a hiatus in addressing&#13;
the environmental impacts of (old) mines operating with leases which were issued before the&#13;
1994 EIA notification. Under the Forest Act, 1980, the renewal of a mining lease is&#13;
considered the grant of a fresh lease and requires site and environmental clearances. Whereas,&#13;
the EIA notification, is silent on this issue and as a result, old mines continue to operate&#13;
without implementing appropriate environmental mitigation measures.&#13;
32.   Industrial Siting. Unplanned and haphazard siting of industries increase the risks to&#13;
the environment, the cost of degradation, and the future cost of mitigation. Also, the current&#13;
industrial clearance process places more emphasis on the stated intent of an industry to&#13;
comply with emission standards, but often does so with disregard for: (a) the cumulative&#13;
pollution in the area, which may already exceed ambient standards; (b) the local environment&#13;
carrying capacity, or its ability to absorb new pollution loads; or (c) local economies of scale&#13;
in providing infrastructure or common effluent treatment plants for municipalities and local&#13;
industry.&#13;
33.   The process of integrating the concern for pollution control into a wide cross-sectoral&#13;
environmental protection strategy has started in India. The data, skills, and techniques&#13;
required to generate thematic maps that incorporate economic, physical, and enviromnental&#13;
themes, are becoming available. Such map overlays are an essential tool to improved local&#13;
environmental planning, and require both financial and human resources.&#13;
34.   In India, the spatial dimension of environmental management requires attention.&#13;
Inappropriate siting of industry, industrial estates, and other land uses leads to unacceptably&#13;
high but avoidable environmental damages, infrastructure costs, concentrations of pollution,&#13;
and social costs, all of which can be lowered through improved planning and industrial siting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
Various technical approaches and tools for environmental planning exist, and most involve&#13;
mapping and zoning of permissible land uses.&#13;
35.   The CPCB has undertaken a pilot project to demonstrate the use of environmental data&#13;
for planning purposes in 17 districts in 14 states. The pilot program is expected to be&#13;
completed in 1996, and the CPCB has acquired much in terms of methodology, technique,&#13;
staffing requirements, and data sources. For each district, the project created a Zoning Atlas&#13;
which contains maps that show the spatial suitability for siting of industries which are liable to&#13;
cause adverse environmental impacts given the environmental features at the site. Now that&#13;
these pilot maps exist, the challenge is to use them as daily tools in siting new industry&#13;
(Department of Industry), the issuing of industrial "no objection certificates" (SPCBs), the&#13;
granting of environmental clearances (State Department of Environment and Forests),&#13;
physical planning (Town and Country Planning Departments), and economic development&#13;
(Metropolitan Development Authorities). The linkages between the Zoning Atlas project and&#13;
implementing agencies remain to be made and pose a challenge which must be addressed as a&#13;
central feature of environmental management.&#13;
36.   Ambient Air Monitoring. Total Suspended Particulates (TSP), S02 and N02 levels&#13;
are regularly monitored (about seven times per month) at stations operated by the National&#13;
Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI) under the jurisdiction of the CPCB in&#13;
ten of India's largest cities, and by the CPCB in about 18 additional cities. NEERI operates&#13;
three stations (residential, commercial and industrial) in each of the cities it monitors. While&#13;
NEERI also analyzes the amount of lead (and other metals) in particulates, CO and ozone are&#13;
monitored only occasionally. PMIO3 is not monitored at all, although NEERI monitors&#13;
respirable particles, which are particles less than 13-14 microns in diameter. The regular&#13;
monitoring of PM1O, lead, CO, and ozone should be instituted at all CPCB stations.&#13;
Knowledge of PM10 levels is crucial to measuring human health effects. Carbon monoxide&#13;
and ozone may indeed become serious problems in Indian cities as vehicle fleets grow.&#13;
37.   In addition, in order to set priorities for controlling urban air pollution in India, it is&#13;
important that emissions inventories be established for each major city. The emissions&#13;
inventory locates on a map (in a GIS database), all major industrial, domestic and mobile&#13;
sources for the common air pollutants and estimates (usually on the basis of quantity of fuel&#13;
burned times appropriate emissions factors) the emissions from each source. When linked&#13;
with source-receptor (dispersion) models, the effect of emitting a ton of particulates (or other&#13;
pollutant) in a given location on ambient air quality can be predicted. Since it is ambient air&#13;
quality that affects human welfare, understanding this linkage is fundamental to doing cost-&#13;
effective analysis of air pollution abatement strategies. Without determining the contribution&#13;
of different sources to ambient pollution at population centers, policy-makers may wind up&#13;
trying to control sources that really do not contribute much to the air pollution-related health&#13;
problem. Previous World Bank documents have mentioned two issues concerning reporting&#13;
of air pollution data in India. One is the long lag between data collection and publication. For&#13;
3PMIO = particles less than ten microns in diameter, which more easily penetrate the lung and are therefore&#13;
more relevant for human health.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
example, in early 1995, the CPCB had not yet released statistics for 1992. Second, the data&#13;
reported on S02 and N02 do not correspond to India's ambient standards for these pollutants,&#13;
making it difficult to assess compliance.&#13;
38.   Coastal and Marine Area Management. The Coastal Regulation Zone notification&#13;
was issued by the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) on February 20th, 1991. By&#13;
this notification, the Government declared "the coastal stretches of seas, bays, estuaries,&#13;
creeks, rivers and backwaters, which are influenced by tidal activities (on the landward side)&#13;
up to 500 meters from the high tide line, and the land between the low tide line and the high&#13;
tide line as the coastal regulation zone" and imposed restrictions on the setting up and&#13;
expansion of industries, operations or processes, etc. on the said zone. The notification listed a&#13;
range of prohibited activities (e.g. setting up of new industries and expansion of existing&#13;
industries, except those directly related to the waterfront or directly needing foreshore&#13;
facilities). Details of the regulations for permissible activities and procedures for monitoring&#13;
and enforcement are discussed in paragraph 27 of Attachment 1.&#13;
39.   Demographic pressure and rapid industrialization generate enormous amounts of waste&#13;
materials which are discharged into the marine environment along India's 7,500 km coastline&#13;
which supports a variety of marine ecosystems, including fragile mangroves and coral reefs.&#13;
Coastal zone management has become extremely complex because of the lack of clarity of the&#13;
roles of various organizations, including the ministries of the Government of India. While the&#13;
Department of Ocean Development is responsible for monitoring marine pollution, they have&#13;
little authority in initiating corrective action to control pollution which comes from land-based&#13;
sources. Under the CRZ notification, coastal states are required to prepare Coastal Zonal&#13;
Management Plans for the approval of MOEF. The approved Coastal Zonal Management&#13;
Plans would form a part of local statutes for enforcing the norms and provisions of the CRZ&#13;
notification. To date, no such plans have been approved; meanwhile, pollution-generating&#13;
activities continue in many coastal areas.&#13;
4 India has 8-hour and 24-hour standards for TSP, N02 and S02 that are not to be violated more than five&#13;
percent of the time. To see whether these standards have been violated requires the frequency distribution&#13;
of 24-hour average and 9-hour average values. NEERI reported the distribution of 4-hour average values,&#13;
and the averaging time used by the CPCB was unclear.&#13;
&#13;

activity would consist of MOEF's Research Division staff and selected members of the&#13;
environmental  research  scientific  community  participating  in  a  multi-element,&#13;
interdisciplinary, international environmental research policy and management forum. A&#13;
major outcome of this interaction would be a revised Environmental Research Program,&#13;
including an implementable action research management plan of policies, practices, and&#13;
procedures. The second activity would consist of local workshops and short courses in&#13;
environmental research methodology and on revised proposal procedures for members of the&#13;
scientific research community. Curriculum development, instructional materials design and&#13;
production, and training of trainers for the workshops would also be undertaken during this&#13;
period. The final activity would include provision of computer hardware and software to&#13;
MOEF's Research Division to facilitate internet access to international environmental&#13;
research data resources. It is expected that India's original environmental research findings&#13;
would be shared and compared with similar topical research findings from abroad and these&#13;
data would become an integral part of ERP policies and practices. The sub-component would&#13;
be implemented by the Research Division of the Ministry of Environment and Forests (para.&#13;
93).&#13;

41.   Environmental Information (US$1.46&#13;
million).   This sub-component will focus  TecknialAssstance&#13;
primarily on data management, i.e., the thematic  Consultnts&#13;
data centers of the Environmental Information   Local            120 staff months&#13;
System (ENVIS), and only secondarily on data  Training&#13;
end users. The objective is to help establish an  Local          105saffmots&#13;
.. . . ~~~~Eqguipment and materiats--&#13;
on-line and geographically decentralized system   E   an  ar&#13;
of information on environmental issues in India, and to support through training, ENVIS&#13;
information users, carriers, and providers in government, academia, business, and NGOs.&#13;
Achievement of this objective will be measurable in terms of scope, access, quality, reliability,&#13;
and completeness of environmental data available to end users.  The environmental&#13;
information (ENVIS) sub-component will consist of:&#13;
(a)   expansion of the ENVIS system, from 23 ENVIS centers to approximately 32&#13;
centers;&#13;
(b)   support to ENVIS centers to upgrade on-line databases, primarily through: on-&#13;
site technical assistance in database management and identification of database&#13;
needs and structure appropriate to their ENVIS role, and support for the&#13;
digitization of data currently only available in printed media; and&#13;
(c)   training to ENVIS users, in the form of short courses offered on a low or no-&#13;
cost basis to ENVIS information users, carriers, and providers, in government,&#13;
academia, business, and NGOs.&#13;
42.   As needed (based on the progress of the proposed UNDP/IDRC  project)&#13;
"Establishment of a sustainable Development Networking Program", data standardization,&#13;
coding, and management issues related to data compatibility across ENVIS centers, would be&#13;
studied. In addition, additional activities for governmental decision makers, in the form of&#13;
strategic studies for the implementation of data-driven environmental decision support&#13;
systems would be considered. The possibilities include: better tracking of ambient&#13;
environmental conditions and trends; the creation of environmental indicators linked with&#13;
measuring the localized impact of current policies; better forecasting including scenarios&#13;
based on alternative courses of' action; and better tracking of firm-level pollution abatement&#13;
and project-level implementation of agreed-upon environmental management plans. The&#13;
Environment Information Division in the MOEF would be the focal point for this sub-&#13;
component (para. 94). It will be assisted primarily by local consultants, using locally procured&#13;
and serviced equipment. One possibility is to use the same project implementation team&#13;
(advisory group and consultants) as the UNDP/IDRC Sustainable Development Network&#13;
Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
43.   Environmental Economics  (US$6.80&#13;
million).  This sub-component will provide  CoFechnc&#13;
support for curriculum development, expanded   Expatriate        96 staffmontis&#13;
teaching, faculty upgrading fellowships, and    Local            670 staff mon6ths&#13;
ongoing research in the area of environmental  Training&#13;
economics. Its objective is to increase the     Overseas         72 staffmonts&#13;
application of economic tools to the general   Local             440asnd mmontha&#13;
debate on environmental management in India&#13;
across the full range of issues such as priority-setting and policy approaches for pollution&#13;
control, resource management, and biodiversity conservation. Achievement of this objective&#13;
will be measurable in terms of the number of college and post-graduates trained in&#13;
environmental economics; the scope and quality of research in the field of environmental&#13;
economics; and the integration of the research recommendations into environmental decision-&#13;
making at the various levels of government.&#13;
44.   The environmental economics sub-component will consist of:&#13;
(a)   establishing an Environmental Economics, Indicators, and Project Planning&#13;
Cell in the Ministry of Environment and Forests;&#13;
(b)   support to develop an environmental economics curriculum, teaching materials,&#13;
case studies, and perhaps a textbook combining India-specific case studies with&#13;
examples of "best practice" from other countries for diploma and degree&#13;
programs;&#13;
(c)   a faculty-upgrading program, designed to train economics faculty members&#13;
from across India in basic environmental economics, in order to better equip&#13;
them to introduce the above curriculum in their respective colleges and&#13;
universities. This will consist primarily of short (1-2 months) courses offered&#13;
in India, but will be supplemented by a few (up to four per year) post-doctoral&#13;
fellowships for 3-12 months at prominent environmental economics faculties in&#13;
other countries.&#13;
(d)   a program to invite environmental economics faculty from other countries to&#13;
spend 1-9 months teaching and conducting research on an India-specific topic.&#13;
(e)   training programs for non-economists on applications of environmental&#13;
economics, especially on such topics as pollution control policy, environmental&#13;
costs and benefits, environrnental assessments, cost-effectiveness, and&#13;
environmental-growth tradeoffs. These programs would consist primarily of&#13;
short (one week) courses, offered to (a) government officials in the MOEF,&#13;
state-level Environment Departments, Pollution Control Board officials,&#13;
members of the Indian Economic Service, non-environment government&#13;
agencies such as Departments of Industry, Coal, Power, Petroleum, Fertilizer,&#13;
Fisheries, Bureau of Industrial Costs and Pricing, Town and Country Planning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
Organization and Directorates, etc., and (b) representatives of industry,&#13;
banking, NGOs, the media, and other interested outside parties.&#13;
(f)   support to university and institute libraries to expand their collections in&#13;
environmental economics in the form of: (i) a one-time stocking of important&#13;
books and journals, and (ii) support for future acquisitions on a declining scale&#13;
over the life of the project; and&#13;
(g)   support to applied research, case studies, and best practices in the area of&#13;
environmental economics. In order to ensure the maximum linkage between&#13;
researchers and students, only universities or institutes offering degree courses&#13;
would compete for research funds.  In addition, in order to assist in&#13;
professional skills transfer, research collaborations between institutes in India&#13;
and in other countries would be encouraged, and limited travel will be&#13;
supported. The general themes of the research program will be developed in&#13;
consultation with the MOEF, the core institutes, and others. Against these&#13;
themes, proposals could be invited. A tentative list of themes would include:&#13;
(i) lessons from experience, especially case studies on how other countries&#13;
have addressed environmental issues; (ii) the costs and benefits of investing in&#13;
the environment; (iii) approaches to regulation enforcement; (iv) approaches to&#13;
decentralization; (v) public participation and public disclosure; and (vi) fiscal&#13;
and financing issues; and (vii) public and private sector roles.&#13;
45.   Environmental  Standards  (US$1.50   TecknieatAssi*ance&#13;
million).   In  India, standards  have  been   Consultants&#13;
challenged for being too lax, too stringent, or    Expatriate        12 staff months&#13;
simply, on  occasion, irrelevant. Given  the   Lrcail                36 staff monhsg&#13;
enormous investment capital that is affected by   Trainl             100 staff months&#13;
firms and municipalities trying to comply with  Eq caipmentandmaterials&#13;
such standards, it is appropriate that standards&#13;
face periodic review and updating. This process is ongoing in India. In this regard, the MOEF&#13;
and CPCB have sought technical assistance in selected areas of this standard-setting and&#13;
review process, in order that the standards adopted incorporate the latest understanding of&#13;
relevant technologies, costs, and options. The objective of this sub-component is to improve&#13;
the economic and environmental efficiency of air, water, and toxic emissions standards being&#13;
set by GOI. Several priority areas have been identified for the development of new standards.&#13;
These relate to: hospital wastes; ozone; pesticides, chemical industries including&#13;
petrochemicals; and man-made fibers. To achieve this, the project will finance expert&#13;
assistance to the CPCB's ongoing review and modification of standards procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
46.   Environmental Indicators and Indices       I T incaAs an - ......&#13;
(US$1.21  million).   Reliable environmental  Conutatsh&amp;&#13;
indicators expressed  in  both  physical and    EXpatriate       48staff monts&#13;
monetary terms provide policy and decision-                         . .....Local  269amonth&#13;
makers with an effective tool with which to make  Overseas       48 stffmonths&#13;
national environmental and economic decisions.                              - Locals 2(X) st    months&#13;
Much of the environmental and economic data    Wumen  materias-d&#13;
generated in India can be effectively utilized for&#13;
decision/policy making when analyzed and aggregated to form environmental indices. This&#13;
sub-component would provide assistance to the Ministry of Environment and Forests and to&#13;
the State of Gujarat to develop the following indicators and indices based on current&#13;
information and policy needs.&#13;
47.   The first activity will be to support the design of a framework of environmental&#13;
indicators appropriate to India's needs. Several approaches exist, such as a recently concluded&#13;
Asian Development Bank-financed study in China, Indonesia, Philippines, Nepal, Pakistan,&#13;
Marshall Islands on environmental indicators that recommended use of the following&#13;
indicators and indices:&#13;
(a)   The Cost-of-Remediation Index.   This index measures environmental&#13;
deterioration directly in economic terns. It is based on the economic theory&#13;
that constraints on economic development can be related to benefits foregone&#13;
via the use of shadow prices of the constraints. If the standards for the quality&#13;
of the environment can be identified, then the costs of meeting this standard&#13;
can be estimated. Four major environmental sectors are considered for the&#13;
estimation: air quality, water quality, land quality, and ecosystem quality.&#13;
Alternatively, the cost-of-remediation approach can also be used to determine&#13;
the economic feasibility of meeting existing environmental standards.&#13;
(b)   Environmental Elasticity.   This  index  expresses the  variability  of&#13;
environmental quality in relation to economic growth. By measuring changes&#13;
in environmental quality relative to changes in the economy, it is possible to&#13;
assess the sustainability of states, regions in a country, and the country as a&#13;
whole. Environmental elasticity is defined as the ratio between change of&#13;
environmental aggregate (weighted average of selected environmental&#13;
indicators) and change of economic aggregate (weighted average of selected&#13;
economic indicators) over a certain time period. Conceptually, when a country&#13;
is achieving improvements in both economy and environmental quality, the&#13;
country is on a sustainable path.  However, when a country (state) is&#13;
experiencing environmental degradation, but economic improvement, if the&#13;
rate of environmental degradation is slower than the rate of economic&#13;
improvement, the country is classified as "weakly sustainable" and&#13;
"unsustainable". The concept of environmental elasticity is particularly useful&#13;
for monitoring environmental trends, which are essential for policy making at&#13;
the macro level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
(c)   Environmental Diamonds.  The diamonds are developed to show, in an&#13;
accurate and quickly absorbable way, the relationship among the four principal&#13;
dimensions of enviromnental quality: air, water, land, and ecosystem. If&#13;
environmental elasticity is developed mainly for monitoring environmental&#13;
trends, environmental diamonds are best used for characterizing the state of the&#13;
environment by the four sectors. For each sector, a normalized index is chosen&#13;
to represent the quality of the enviromnent, and the four indices chosen are&#13;
used to draw a diamond graph. The great strength of the environmental&#13;
diamonds is their flexibility in use. One can base them on conventional indices&#13;
or cost-of-remediation indices. They are very good for visual comparison&#13;
among sectors or among countries.&#13;
48.   Other approaches to the development of environmental indicators include (a) sectoral&#13;
indicators that link environmental progress to the broader objective of sustainable&#13;
development; and (b) a formal pressure-state-response framework that helps to identify critical&#13;
issues and actions required across a wide range of environmental issues. This indicator design&#13;
activity will be undertaken in close collaboration with both government and NGO users of&#13;
environmental indicators. The second activity to be supported under this subcomponent will&#13;
be to implement (and fine-tune) the proposed indicators, and to test their usefulness at both the&#13;
center and in the State of Gujarat. The environmental indicators subcomponent will be closely&#13;
associated with the environmental economics and environmental information subcomponents,&#13;
since the information and analytical aspects of all these are mutually reinforcing.&#13;
B. Strengthening Environmental Administration (Proposed Outlay US$3.83 million).&#13;
This component of the project includes four subcomponents as follows:&#13;
49.   The Regional Offices of the Ministry   Technkal Assitane&#13;
of Environment and  Forests  (US$1.46  Consultants&#13;
million) would be supported in two ways under  Expatriate      12 staffmonths&#13;
Local           I100 staff monfth&#13;
this sub-component.  The first is a detailed  TLamoing&#13;
review of the functions, staffing, workload, and  Overseas     20 staff months&#13;
location of the Regional Offices. It would also  Local          140 staff months&#13;
cover the systems and procedures employed by  Equipmnent and materials&#13;
the Regional Offices as called for under existing regulations, and examine the problems of&#13;
overlapping jurisdictions which constrain the effective collaboration of the Regional Offices&#13;
with state agencies, particularly the State Pollution Control Boards. A special focus of the&#13;
review will be the role currently being played by the Regional Offices in the monitoring and&#13;
implementation of the Environment Impact Assessment (EIA) mechanism which is a major&#13;
instrument of the environmental management system (paras.13-15). The outcome of this&#13;
review is likely to be an action plan to expand the number of Regional Offices and to upgrade&#13;
their staffing to better respond to regional differences in industrial development. The second&#13;
part of this sub-component would be to implement a program of training for existing and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
newly appointed staff of the Regional Offices. This program would include a training needs&#13;
assessment, curriculum and training materials development, and the training of staff. Training&#13;
would cover topics related to environmental impact assessment and monitoring, coastal and&#13;
marine area management (para. 82), mining (paras. 70 - 71), air pollution monitoring (Para.&#13;
76) as well as environmental law (para. 64). It is expected that at the conclusion of the&#13;
technical assistance program, the Regional Offices would be staffed, equipped, located and&#13;
trained to be able to effectively monitor industry compliance with the Environmental&#13;
Management Plans which are a requirement of the Environmental Impact Assessment&#13;
Notification.&#13;
50.   Ministry of Environment and Forests (US$ 0.76 million) would establish a Project&#13;
Cell to service the National Steering Committee of the project (para. 91). Funds would be&#13;
provided to cover the costs of the Procurement Agency which would assist the MOEF and&#13;
other implementing agencies with the procurement of equipment, goods, contractual staff, and&#13;
consultant services; and local consultants to assist with the development and implementation&#13;
of the project monitoring and evaluation system. The capacity within the MOEF would also&#13;
be strengthened with the establishment of the Environmental Economics, Indicators, and&#13;
Project Planning Cell (paras. 44(a); 95) and expert assistance from specialized institutions for&#13;
the environmental law and mining sector subcomponents (paras. 99 and 101).&#13;
51.   The Department of Ocean Development (US$0.87 million) would establish a Project&#13;
Implementation Cell to coordinate and manage the implementation of the coastal and marine&#13;
area management subcomponents of the project (Paras. 77-82; 102).&#13;
52.   The Gujarat Department of Forests and Environment (US$0.74 million) would&#13;
establish a Project Implementation Cell to coordinate all project activities in the State. It&#13;
would work closely with the Project Implementation Cell in the MOEF, the Project&#13;
Implementation Cell of the DOD; and in Gujarat, with the Gujarat Pollution Control Board&#13;
and the Gujarat Ecology Commission.&#13;
C. Strengthening the Decentralization of Environmental Management (Proposed Outlay&#13;
US$5.41 million).&#13;
This component of the project includes three subcomponents:&#13;
53.   The National Environmental Awareness&#13;
Campaign (US$2.03 million) subcomponent would                    ....s..&#13;
include support for management, procedures, and    E... xpatriate.2 sa . mos &#13;
target audience impact studies focusing on option  Lo XXl       144 staff months&#13;
for the program's evolution to a National Train,ing&#13;
Environmental Action Campaign (paras. 16-19).                  ....a. 2.  month;-&#13;
Based on these studies, a revised program would be $quipnentand materki&#13;
designed and piloted in two states. The plan also                          ...&#13;
would include decentralization of the campaign from the Center to the State Departments of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
Environment and include appropriate staff training and support. In addition, two existing&#13;
support Centers would be strengthened by electronic networking and training in order to&#13;
design, produce, and train for a new generation of environmental action instruction materials&#13;
designed to incorporate environmental action elements as well as awareness information.&#13;
54.   A new media campaign would enhance present MOEF efforts by linking productions&#13;
with other community-based environmental action campaigns. The subcomponent would&#13;
include training for MOEF headquarters and Regional Office Staff, State Department of&#13;
Environment and Forests staff, and NGOs, in target audience stratification and focus group&#13;
interview techniques, and fund the production of public service radio and television&#13;
announcements combined with target group impact measurement. The second part of the&#13;
subcomponent would support a series of workshops for print and visual media journalists on&#13;
environmental problems, programs, and mitigation efforts.&#13;
55.   The   Paryavaran    Vahini   (PV)  TechnialAssistance&#13;
(Environmental Brigade) (US$ 0.98 million)  Consultants&#13;
subcomponent would include a review of the    Local            85 staffmonths&#13;
existing 130 established Paryavaran Vahinis,  Training                      l&#13;
identify exemplary practices and procedures,  Local            200 staff months&#13;
train MOEF Regional Office staff responsible for l uipment admaterials&#13;
existing and projected Paryavaran Vahinis in community-based training of trainers techniques&#13;
and evaluation, train State Department of Environment and Forests staff to coordinate the&#13;
district based Paryavaran Vahinis in their state, provide recently developed water and soil&#13;
testing kits to Paryavaran Vahini members (both for community awareness activities and soil&#13;
and water monitoring), and support an accelerated five year program of Paryavaran Vahini&#13;
establishment and member training for an additional 284 districts for an end of project total of&#13;
424. Refresher training for existing Paryavaran Vahini members (6000) would be combined&#13;
with induction training for the 284 additional Paryavaran Vahinis to be established.&#13;
56.   NGO  Environmental Action  Fund  | TechnicalAswistance&#13;
(US$ 2.40 million).  NGO community-based  Conasultants&#13;
environmental action is part of the overall MOEF  Local        800 staff months&#13;
strategy for implementing the Environmental I&#13;
Action Program. Implementation of the strategy includes funding NGOs for environmental&#13;
awareness and action activities. Several international donors including the UNDP, Canada,&#13;
Norway, Sweden, the UK, and the USA provide funds for small NGO education and&#13;
awareness programs. The project will support the establishment of a NGO Environmental&#13;
Action Fund (NEAF) for discrete environmental mitigation action projects to be carried out by&#13;
larger NGOs or consortia of smaller NGOs to carry out community-based projects.&#13;
57.   The objectives of the project would be achieved through the participation of different&#13;
stakeholders, i.e "borrowing stakeholders" consisting of central, state and local governments,&#13;
"primary stakeholders" the community, their groups and organizations; and "secondary&#13;
stakeholders" such as NGOs and other organizations which have a stake in sustainable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
development. The NEAF is designed to facilitate such a participative process for&#13;
environmental management capacity building for sustainable development in Gujarat.&#13;
58.   The use of NEAF would be piloted in Gujarat which is experiencing rapid&#13;
industrialization, infrastructure development, and urbanization. All of this leads to certain&#13;
adverse environmental impacts, particularly by chemical industries, mining, hazardous waste&#13;
disposal, and industrial air and water pollution. Gujarat also has ecologically fragile areas&#13;
such as Gulf of Kachch, including its Rann, Gulf of Khambat and some Protected Areas. In&#13;
order to anticipate, prevent and mitigate such adverse environmental impacts, the Government&#13;
of Gujarat (GOG) is also planning to prepare a State Environment Action Program (SEAP) in&#13;
line with the Environment Action Program (EAP) which the Government of India issued in&#13;
December 1993. The preparation of SEAP would be coordinated by GOG's Department of&#13;
Forests and Environment and Gujarat Ecology Commission. The NEAF would facilitate the&#13;
participatory process of the preparation of the SEAP. As part of the SEAP process, NGOs&#13;
would be involved in (a) review of Gujarat's Environmental Status Report through a series of&#13;
consultations, public hearings, workshops and seminars; (b) implementation of priority&#13;
selected studies or surveys identified by the SEAP Steering Committee; (c) review of hot spot&#13;
mitigation plans; and (d) review of long-term strategies being endorsed in the draft SEAP.&#13;
The NEAF in particular will be used by NGOs to concentrate on environmental actions that&#13;
would anticipate, prevent, and mitigate adverse environmental impacts. The NEAF will be&#13;
administered by a Committee for NGO Environmental Action Fund.&#13;
59.   The Committee for NGO Environmental Action Fund (COMNEAF) which will&#13;
administer the NEAF will have full administrative and financial authority to manage and&#13;
administer it in a transparent and participatory manner that would involve only the members&#13;
of COMNEAF. The COMNEAF will consist of the Additional Chief Secretary, Department of&#13;
Forests and Environment as Chairman; the Chairman and Member Secretary of the Gujarat&#13;
Ecology Comnmission; the Secretary of the Gujarat Pollution Control Board; one&#13;
representative of MOEF; the Secretary, Industry and Mines Department, (GOG), the Secretary&#13;
of Water Supply in the Departement of Health and Family Welfare (GOG); and&#13;
representatives from industries and NGOs as members. The Member-Secretary, Gujarat&#13;
Ecology Commission will be the Secretary of COMNEAF which will meet at least once every&#13;
three months, will maintain the Minutes of the meetings and records of the Committee.&#13;
COMNEAF will have the authority to receive, consider, and approve proposals for funding&#13;
under NEAF, and also to regularly monitor and evaluate the programs funded by it directly&#13;
and indirectly through consultants and other organizations that are approved by the&#13;
Committee. The Committee will formulate its own process of decision-making through a&#13;
participatory process after it has been constituted.&#13;
60.   NGOs which have an interest in sustainable development and are actively involved in&#13;
environmental management of different eco-system and at different levels - Gram Panchayat,&#13;
town, block, district and state would be eligible for funding from the NEAF. The following&#13;
criteria would be used to select and involve appropriate NGOs. They should have: (a) been a&#13;
Registered Society, Trust, Educational or an Industrial institution which has been registered&#13;
under a relevant act in Gujarat that authorizes it to undertake actions that could be funded&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
from NEAF; (b) completed a minimum of three years since registration and fulfilled the&#13;
mandatory requirements of the relevant Act under which it is registered such as the Annual&#13;
Audit of Account. Some relaxation of this criteria may be considered on a case-by-case basis&#13;
by COMNEAF; (c) demonstrated experience and presence in environment management,&#13;
including action-research, education, training, consumer rights, rural development; urban&#13;
development, and ecodevelopment; (d) appropriate professional skills and experience which&#13;
are necessary to successful research, planning, implementing, and monitoring a program&#13;
through a process of participation involving the community, comnmunity based organizations&#13;
(CBOs) and Gram Panchayats; and (e) have a clearer understanding of the relations between&#13;
people and their environment and also their environmental, social, economic and cultural&#13;
impacts on communities including tribals and women. In order to facilitate direct participation&#13;
of the people, elected Gram Panchyats will also be considered to be stakeholders, who are&#13;
eligible to receive funds from NEAF on the basis of Special Action Plans that are in&#13;
accordance with the criteria for funding.&#13;
61.   The Fund would support programs that would help to anticipate, avoid, and mitigate&#13;
adverse environrmental impacts centering around emergency and specific environmental&#13;
problems emanating from chemical industries, mining, waste disposal, and protection of&#13;
ecologically fragile areas. The program would be multi-level based and participatory oriented.&#13;
Priorities for funding would be for: (a) preparation of State of Gujarat's Environment; State&#13;
of District Environment (for each District); and State of Eco-system (for each eco-system and&#13;
Protected Area); (b) action plans for mitigating specific environmental problems at different&#13;
levels; (c) actions plans for participative management of village common properties,&#13;
ecologically fragile areas such as forest lands, coastal areas and desert areas; (d) ensuring&#13;
compliance of environmental acts by organizing participatory public hearings and "social&#13;
audit" by Citizens Groups, CBOs, and NGOs; (e) organizing training of staff of NGOs,&#13;
members of Gram Panchayats, community leaders, teachers, consultants and their staff to&#13;
enhance environmental capacity and protection; (f) curriculum for environmental education to&#13;
be used at primary and high schools as an integral part of study; (g) materials for&#13;
environmental education, training and campaigns; (h) formulation and demonstration of&#13;
environmentally non-degrading, technically appropriate and socially acceptable technologies&#13;
for sustainable development; and (i) environmental upgrading of private sector that is&#13;
participative and socially acceptable, through a transparent and participative process.&#13;
&#13;

D. Strengthening the Implementation of Environmental Law (Proposed Outlay&#13;
US$ 4.15 million).&#13;
The component of the project includes one subcomponent with three parts.&#13;
62.   Environmental Law (US$4.15 million).  ! Tecli- IIa-Assiance&#13;
India  has  a  comprehensive  framework  of  co*Et-&#13;
environmental  legislation   and  regulations.       p                  Mgatiate -  70sff imonth&#13;
Although there are some areas of substantive law   Local             155 stafftmonthl&#13;
that need  to  be further clarified, there is       .Contactual Staff  .65staff.mo....&#13;
consensus in the Indian legal community that the   Trainig&#13;
priority in the area of environmental law is the    0  Vtseas        60 stafnomths.&#13;
development of legal capacity to assist effective  4Loca             400dstaff months91&#13;
implementation of existing laws. From a legal  -      We d materials&#13;
perspective, the main challenge to improve implementation of laws is to strengthen voluntary&#13;
compliance with laws as well as capacity to monitor and enforce laws. There is wide&#13;
recognition that both these objectives involve very complex issues relating not only to legal&#13;
rules and institutions, but also to the broader processes by which communities and individuals&#13;
define their relationship with the natural environment. It is a continuing process, rather than a&#13;
finite objective.&#13;
63.   With this perspective, the project will assist in strengthening voluntary compliance, as&#13;
well as capacity for enforcement. The approach of the legal component rests on the&#13;
assumption that, in the long-term communities will play a central role in this effort. Through a&#13;
bottom-up, participatory approach based on traditional approaches to compliance with law and&#13;
norms governing environmental resource use, the Project will support the development of&#13;
specific actionable strategies to reduce the gap between law and practice.&#13;
64.   The Project will support strengthening of legal infrastructure for implementation of&#13;
environmental law by:&#13;
(a)   the provision of training in environmental law (including international aspects)&#13;
to legal staff of the MOEF, CPCB, and SPCBs, as well as industrial managers&#13;
and non-governmental organizations;&#13;
(b)    ensuring that suitably qualified environmental lawyers are available as follow:&#13;
(i) at least two lawyers for each SPCB; (ii) at least four lawyers at the CPCB;&#13;
(iii) at least three lawyers at MOEF; and&#13;
(c)    establishing a computerized environmental law network which will provide&#13;
current information on environmental law and regulations at the national and&#13;
state levels.&#13;
65.   The Project will also support the development of community-based environmental&#13;
decision-making and dispute resolution. This component will seek to assist the enhancement&#13;
of decentralization and devolution of environmental law administration, while maintaining the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
appropriate role of central and state authorities for policy setting and enforcement. In&#13;
empowering communities in this regard, traditional panchayats and other instruments of local&#13;
government established in India under its recent Panchayat Raj legislation would have a&#13;
central role. The Project will identify ways through which communities and affected groups,&#13;
as well as individuals (particularly in the local context) may be better informed about laws and&#13;
regulation, participate in key decisions under the environmental statutes, and have&#13;
responsibility for monitoring compliance. To this end, the Project will support studies that will&#13;
develop strategies such as for:&#13;
(a)   the delegation and devolution of selected responsibilities under environmental&#13;
laws to villages, panchayats and municipalities including the provision of&#13;
technical and advisory services to them from non-governmental sources;&#13;
information access and dissemination to affected communities and the public at&#13;
large, including the establishment of information centers at the state and district&#13;
levels;&#13;
(b)   instituting public hearings related to key environmental decisions such as siting&#13;
of new industries, as well as implementation of remediation measures; and&#13;
(c)   establishment of capacity in communities for monitoring compliance with laws&#13;
including for the collection and provision of data as evidence of compliance&#13;
under environmental laws; and&#13;
(d)   building legal capacity of non-governmental organizations for monitoring&#13;
compliance with environmental laws, regulations and decisions, with emphasis&#13;
on highly polluted areas.&#13;
The Project will support piloting and the initial implementation of these strategies once they&#13;
are discussed and agreed with the Government. The Project will support specific proposals on&#13;
a grant basis. The outputs of the research program supported under the Project will provide&#13;
valuable inputs for the development of these strategies.&#13;
66.   Effective non-litigatory remedies for affected persons/communities. This will involve&#13;
establishment of decentralized administrative review procedures accessible to local&#13;
communities and affected members of the public, which will not require the use of formal&#13;
legal procedures. These review procedures, which would be modeled along the successful&#13;
experience of India with "Lok Adalat" forums (community-based mediation), would provide&#13;
easily accessible and local forums for public hearings and initial resolution of environmental&#13;
grievances. In addition, the strategy will propose ways to use mediation and conciliation as&#13;
well as traditional approaches to dispute settlement. Support would be provided for the&#13;
implementation of the strategy in selected highly polluted areas through supporting&#13;
development of institutional capacity in this regard.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
67.   Strengthening of legal research and legal education in environmental law would be&#13;
achieved by:&#13;
(a)   establishment of a Center for Law and the Environment a selected Law School&#13;
in India as a center for excellence in environmental law, consisting of the&#13;
provision of a full-time faculty position; the Center will be responsible of&#13;
establishing relationships with the Law Schools in India providing teaching in&#13;
environmental law; development of a core syllabus and curriculum to train&#13;
teachers of environmental law; development of syllabus and teaching materials&#13;
(including a case book) for teaching environmental law in Indian Law Schools;&#13;
and the provision of resources for the establishment of a library of&#13;
environmental law at the Center with a core international collection; as well as&#13;
provision of books and materials to selected law school libraries;&#13;
(b)   assessment of the scope and coverage of existing laws to effectively achieve&#13;
policy objectives, including effective coordination between various environ-&#13;
mental laws and regulations;&#13;
(c)   a program of empirical research into the role of law in environmental matters in&#13;
India that would establish a body of scholarly information on (i) traditional and&#13;
customary laws governing access to and use of natural resources and the&#13;
resolution of disputes related thereto; (ii) use of law and legal remedies by&#13;
individuals and communities in India in relation to environmental matters,&#13;
including environmental disputes in courts; and (iii) use of law to achieve&#13;
priority policy objectives. The research program will produce a report in each&#13;
of the above areas, with specific recommendations for consideration by the&#13;
Government; and&#13;
(d)   environmental law publication: the Project will support the establishment of a&#13;
high quality publication on environmental law, to be published by a selected&#13;
Law School in India.&#13;
E. Strengthening Environmental Monitoring and Compliance in Specific High-Priority&#13;
Problem Areas (Proposed Outlay US$ 26.93 million).&#13;
This component includes four sub-components as follows:&#13;
68.   Mining Sector (US$6.31 million). The  TecniclAsistanc&#13;
main objective of this sub-component is to  0ConsutAnts&#13;
strengthen the national capacity for environmental                       raExpatriate  116 staxt&#13;
the mining  Local            530 staffnmonths_.&#13;
monitoring and implementation in the mining    raining&#13;
sector (paras. 26-31). More specifically, this sub-  Overseas      50 staff months&#13;
component aims to enhance the capabilities of the  Local           400 staff months&#13;
concerned central (CPCB, Regional Offices of  Equipment and materials&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
MOEF) and State agencies (Departments of Enviromnent, Mining and Geology Departments,&#13;
and State Pollution Control boards) in developing and monitoring the compliance of local&#13;
policies, EMPs, and appropriate environmental standards for all mining projects. The existing&#13;
mining institutions such as the Center for Mining Environment, Dhanbad; Indian Bureau of&#13;
Mines, and others will be strengthened in the planning and design of environmentally benignl&#13;
mining projects, and become a resource group for MOEF, state Departments of Environment,&#13;
CPCB and State Pollution Control Boards.&#13;
69.   The following four major activities are envisaged: (a) review  of existing&#13;
policies/standards and their compliance mechanisms; (b) institutional strengthening; (c)&#13;
training; and (d) demonstration projects. All four activities are inter-related and will be&#13;
carefully phased and coordinated to achieve the objective. For example, the review will help&#13;
identify institutional needs, the demonstration projects will provide specialized training&#13;
opportunities and generate information that will strengthen the institution.&#13;
70.   Review of policies/standards and their compliance mechanisms is expected to produce&#13;
four main outcomes: (a) an inventory analysis of existing environmental and mine leasing&#13;
policies, with respect to environmental and social concerns, and the roles and responsibilities&#13;
of various agencies at central, state and local levels in implementing these policies; (b)&#13;
identification of institutional and technical barriers to compliance with existing policies and in&#13;
promoting environmentally benign mining designs and mitigation practices; (c) generation or&#13;
policy options and standards for major and minor minerals mining projects; and (d)&#13;
unambiguous definition of roles and responsibilities of multiple agencies which will be&#13;
complementary to each other. This review will also provide feedback to the other sub-&#13;
component--strengthening of Regional Offices of MOEF, in the context of monitoring the&#13;
compliance of EMPs for mining projects. While the local consultants would carry out the&#13;
review, foreign consultants would bring in international experiences in formulating policies&#13;
and standards.&#13;
71.   Institutional strengthening activity is expected to cover two sets of institutions. One&#13;
set consists of government agencies at central (Indian Bureau of Mines, the MOEF and&#13;
CPCB) and state (Department of Forests and Environment, Regional Offices of MOEF, and&#13;
State Pollution Control Boards) level who are responsible for policy making, standard setting&#13;
and enforcement. These agencies will be strengthened to: (a) enhance their capacity to&#13;
monitor the compliance of EMPs and the prescribed environmental standards by mine&#13;
operators; and (b) establish an effective data management system and a computer network&#13;
among these agencies to assist the sharing of information and decision making processes. The&#13;
other set of institutions are the Centers of Excellence and research agencies working in the&#13;
field of mining. These will be strengthened to: (a) develop their expertise in planning,&#13;
design, and implementation of environmentally benign mine designs; (b) become a resource&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
group for the government agencies described above, in discharging their responsibilities and&#13;
for the miners in implementation of environmentally benign designs; and (c) carry out specific&#13;
research/studies to equip the Indian mine sector with latest developments. Equipment and&#13;
instruments for field research and surveys required for achieving these outputs will be&#13;
provided. In order to bring in international experience and state of the art technological&#13;
developments in mining, twinning arrangements with reputed mining institutions in developed&#13;
countries, where mining is a major economic activity will be provided.&#13;
72.   Best practice demonstration projects for specific mitigation measures, such as land&#13;
reclamation, closure of old abandoned mines, regeneration of regional ecology, etc. offer&#13;
many advantages. One is to develop feasible mitigation measures and techniques for major&#13;
mineral mining projects. Another is to train mine operators in instilling the principles of&#13;
planning, design, implementation, and monitoring the mitigation measures. Also, these&#13;
projects generate information that can be used for policy and decision making. The procedures&#13;
and criteria for selection, funding, and implementation of demonstration projects/mitigation&#13;
measures have to be developed. Three major outcomes are expected from the demonstration&#13;
projects i.e.: a limited number of successful demonstrations of EMPs; an analysis of the&#13;
project outcomes and feedback for policy making and standards setting processes; and&#13;
technical and management guidelines for different minerals mining projects.&#13;
73.   Training of key staff members of the above-described institutions would be an&#13;
essential input for realizing the objective of this sub-project. Depending on the target groups&#13;
and their specific needs, specialized training programs will be organized within and outside&#13;
India. The broad areas would be: planning, design and implementation of environmentally&#13;
benign designs, development and monitoring compliance of policies, standards, EMPs, etc.,&#13;
74.   Industry   Siting   (Zoning   Atlas)&#13;
(US$8.44 million). The CPCB has proposed a  Cns ultants'&#13;
five-year program  to map all of the rapidly    Eptatemts&#13;
industrializing districts across India, using the  Lcal.          680 staff mos.&#13;
same technology and methodology used in the   Training&#13;
pilot mapping program (para. 35). In addition,  Overseas          120 Gstaf mnhs.&#13;
Local.           980 staff months.&#13;
the plan includes components for state.-WideEq,enadmaeal&#13;
mapping  of  ecologically  sensitive  areas,&#13;
proposed sites for new industrial estates, and the drafting of national guidelines for industrial&#13;
siting and land use planning. The work program would be managed by the Environmental&#13;
Planning Studio in the CPCB, with institutional linkages via the SPCBs to the state and&#13;
district level planning authorities in each state. The objective of this sub-component is to&#13;
involve district, state, and central level environmental and planning agencies in the shared task&#13;
of creating environmental thematic district-level maps, following the methodology already&#13;
developed by the CPCB. This sub-component will focus on training many of the map end-&#13;
users who are currently unfamiliar with the use of environmental maps in planning and&#13;
industrial siting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
75.   This sub-component will include:&#13;
(a)    updating the draft guidelines for preparing zoning atlases, to be made available&#13;
to all map users.&#13;
(b)   including of up to 65 more districts in the mapping program, which will require&#13;
the installation of environmental planning studies in each of the participating&#13;
SPCBs, with the requisite hardware, software, and training to be supervised by&#13;
the core CPCB team.&#13;
(c)   identifying, in those districts with completed maps, both unsuitable and&#13;
suitable sites for industry and industrial estates. Then, provisional guidelines&#13;
for industrial estate siting will be developed and tested, finalized and&#13;
implemented in all districts with completed maps.&#13;
(d)   drafting, starting with a case study in Gujarat, guidelines for industrial&#13;
development and land-use planning on the state level, taking into account a&#13;
broad range of industry, urban, agricultural, forest, and ecologically sensitive&#13;
(and perhaps protected) areas.&#13;
76.   Ambient Air Pollution Monitoring&#13;
(US$ 6.47 million). The objective of this&#13;
sub-component is to assist the Central         Eptt1a                      h&#13;
Pollution Control Board in upgrading India's   LoWal             240 staff months&#13;
air  pollution  monitoring  system.  The   Training&#13;
upgrading is needed to bring India's air       Local             200 staff    --onts&#13;
pollution  reporting  up  to  a  sufficient   qi    ad materials&#13;
standard to allow: (a) emissions inventories of critical air pollutants to be completed for&#13;
India's major cities, including ambient monitoring of some key pollutants that impact o n&#13;
human health that are not currently sampled (such as fine particulates); (b) cost-effectiveness&#13;
analysis of air pollution control strategies that link source reduction strategies with down-wind&#13;
ambient impacts; and (c) reliable analysis of trends over time. Although India has a base&#13;
network in place of over 200 fixed air monitoring stations nation-wide, the technology&#13;
employed has been shown to contain some inaccuracies. Also, the proposed upgrading will&#13;
increase somewhat the geographic coverage of the air monitoring system. The subcomponent&#13;
would build on the recommendations for improving air pollution monitoring from the State&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
Pollution Control Boards, National Environmental Engineering Research Institute (NEERI),&#13;
and the current GTZ technical assistance project with the SPCBs. It would help finance the&#13;
purchase of more accurate air pollution monitoring equipment, provide training to staff of the&#13;
CPCB and SPCBs on equipment use, and provide training on the preliminary analysis and&#13;
reporting of results.&#13;
77.   Coastal and Marine Area Management   TechniculAssce&#13;
(US$5.71 million). To assist in the development   u4ows&#13;
of comprehensive  coastal and  marine  area       Expatiiate        6 staff monts.&#13;
management the project would support the: (a)     Local             405 staffionths..'.&#13;
development of a GIS-based information system   Tr Contat Staff     172 staff monhs&#13;

ecological modeling of selected coastal areas; and (d) development of Environmental Impact&#13;
Assessment guidelines for major marine and coastal area developmental activities.&#13;
78.   Development of GIS-based Critical Habitats Information System for Coastal Marine&#13;
Areas in India To develop and maintain GIS-based databases for assessing and managing&#13;
critical habitats and their resources, the project will support: (a) a review of the availability of&#13;
existing data and collecting data on relevant parameters for critical habitats; (b) preparation of&#13;
Critical Habitats Area Maps on 1:25,000 scale using IRS LISS-II satellite data; (c) integration of&#13;
satellite and field data using the ARC/INFO GIS software and development of a GIS-based&#13;
Critical Habitat Information System (CHIS); (d) interpretation and analysis of data to provide&#13;
plans for efficient monitoring and management of critical habitats; and (e) organizing end-user&#13;
training-cum-workshops for selected coastal state governments and other end-users to promote&#13;
the adoption of CHIS in the management of critical habitats. The expected outcome of the above&#13;
activities would be a CHIS for the coastal and marine areas of India including the Lakshwadeep&#13;
and Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the form of computer package with a user-interactive&#13;
menu; output maps to delineate where critical habitats have to be conserved; end-user utilization&#13;
programs; and a Final Report with plans for sustainable development of critical habitats in&#13;
coastal and marine areas. The institutions which would be responsible for collection of&#13;
ground/sea-truth data for the critical habitats are shown in Box 1.&#13;

79.    Preparation of Model Integrated Coastal and Marine Area Management Plans.  The&#13;
major objective of this activity is to develop capabilities in the development of Integrated&#13;
Coastal and Marine Area Management Plans (ICMAMPs) in India; and establish training&#13;
programs to build capacity in the coastal states to prepare ICMAMPs. To achieve these&#13;
objectives, the project would support: overseas training of scientists on the methodologies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
involved in the development of ICMAMPs; developing model ICMAMPs; establishing training&#13;
programs in India for planners, scientists, NGOs, environmental consultants, educators, and&#13;
university students in coastal states; and assisting coastal States (Gujarat in particular) in the&#13;
development of ICMAMPs and assisting DOD in the evaluation of these plans.&#13;
80.   Several developed countries have adopted integrated coastal area management. In order&#13;
to quickly acquire the knowledge and facilitate immediate development of ICMAMPs in India, it&#13;
is necessary to expose scientists and planners to this concept through fellowship training&#13;
overseas. After the completion of the overseas training program, trainees will become the full or&#13;
part-time trainers in the courses proposed to be organized under the project. The development of&#13;
model plans is also critical. Therefore, using the knowledge acquired through experts services&#13;
and overseas training, model ICMAMPs along with requisite GIS-based information system will&#13;
be prepared for two or three selected areas among Madras, Cochin, Goa and Mumbai. The&#13;
establishment of a training center as a part of the Project Directorate at Madras to provide&#13;
training in the preparation of ICMAMPs, will help the sectoral governments in developing&#13;
expertise in the development of ICMAMPs and facilitate quick development of the plans.&#13;
Courses to be provided include: (a) theoretical courses on coastal marine activities and their&#13;
impact on environment; (b) requirements for preparation of ICMAMPs and relevance of GIS-&#13;
based infornation system techniques as a technical aid and pre-requisite in the development of&#13;
ICMAMP; (c) adoption of use-classification and zoning concepts in the preparation of&#13;
ICMAMPs; and (d) development of ICMAMPs with examples of model plans. Institutions like&#13;
the National Institute of Oceanography will be involved in the preparation of ICMAMPs.&#13;
81.   Waste Assimilation Capacity and Ecological Modeling of Selected Coastal Areas. The&#13;
project would support Waste Load Allocation (WLAs) studies for three estuarine&#13;
environments which face water quality problems because of urban and industrial&#13;
development. These systems are the Tapi estuary, Cochin backwaters, and Ennore estuary.&#13;
The project would help develop indigenous expertise in this area and generate further WLA&#13;
programs for the remaining riverine and coastal waterways. The output of the project over five&#13;
years would be: a report on water quantity and quality uses for the three surface water bodies;&#13;
calibrated and validated models for dissolved oxygen and eco-toxicity; a management plan or&#13;
waste load allocation for the three sites; recommendations to the State Pollution Control&#13;
Boards (SPCBs) accompanied by a preliminary cost-benefit analysis, and social implications;&#13;
and guidelines to DOD/CPCB on how to conduct WLAs in remaining coastal waters. The&#13;
institutions which would be involved are shown on Box 2.&#13;

Developmental Activities. The objectives of the activity are to review existing literature and&#13;
similar EIA statements and develop an understanding of the impacts of developmental&#13;
projects; and develop guidelines for EIAs of key development projects. The deliverables&#13;
would be: (a) guidelines for conducting EIA for marine developmental projects. The&#13;
guidelines would be available for individual projects and also as a reference volume; (b) a&#13;
Resource Center with a compilation of data for easy implementation of marine ElAs. This&#13;

This component of the project includes 2 subcomponents.&#13;
83.    Gujarat is the fastest industrializing state in India. Investments in the state are expected&#13;
to reach about Rs. 730 billion over the next few years. Of this, Rs. 430 billion would be in&#13;
highly polluting bulk drugs, chemical and dye industries, and port development projects. Ten&#13;
sites have already been identified for port development. Therefore, in addition to the&#13;
assistance to be provided for the development of Integrated Coastal and Marine Area&#13;
Management Plans (ICMAMP) (para. 79-80); the development of State-wide environmental&#13;
indicators and indices (para. 46-48); and the NGO Environmental Action Fund (Para. 56-61),&#13;
Gujarat will also be supported in two additional specific activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
84.   Institutional Strengthening (US$6.28   TeclnkalAssstnce    -&#13;
million).   Support would be provided to  Consultants&#13;
strengthen the Department of Forests and       Expatriate        36 staff monfts&#13;
Environment  and  the  Gujarat  Ecology        Local             740 staff months&#13;

under  ongoing   Bank-assisted  Industrial     Local             240 staff montths&#13;
Pollution  Control and  Industrial Pollution  Equipment and materials&#13;
Prevention   projects,  are  the  principal&#13;
environmental management institutions in the State, and the assistance would be designed to&#13;
enhance data and information collection, analysis, policy formulation, implementation and&#13;
monitoring of compliance with laws and standards in high priority areas. The environmental&#13;
management institutions in the State would be further strengthened through the preparation of&#13;
environmental indicators, industrial siting, coastal and marine area management planning, and&#13;
the environmental economics, information and research components.&#13;
85.   State Environmental Action Program. (US$ 1.05 million). A major output of the&#13;
institutional strengthening program in Gujarat is the preparation of a State Environment&#13;
Action Program  (SEAP) with the active cooperation and coordination of all relevant&#13;
government departments, industry, NGOs, and others through a series of workshops,&#13;
seminars, and consultations. The SEAP would be coordinated by the Department of Forests&#13;
and Environment Given the background of rapid economic development, the agenda for&#13;
environmental action in Gujarat is enormous. The government needs to prioritize the areas for&#13;
action so that maximum benefits can be available with the available resources in the shortest&#13;
possible time. In accordance with the extensive international experience accumulated in the&#13;
preparation of National Environmental Action Plans, a three-stage process will be followed&#13;
during the preparation of the State's Environmental Action Program. The First Stage would&#13;
have a duration of about 6 months and would consist of the following activities: (a)&#13;
identification of known coordination and participatory consultative mechanisms; (b) naming a&#13;
high-level advisory committee responsible for overall supervision of the SEAP in the three&#13;
stages, obtaining official approval of the SEAP, and for the allocation of necessary resources;&#13;
(c) establishing technical working groups to deal with each priority environmental problem,&#13;
made up of representatives of the relevant agencies and the NGOs, and other experts; and (d)&#13;
identifying appropriate public participation mechanisms to stimulate a wide debate on priority&#13;
environmental problems and their respective solutions, and to obtain public consensus on&#13;
these.&#13;
86.   Preparation of a rapid environmental status report based on secondary sources of&#13;
information in order to develop a reliable database would be undertaken. This activity will&#13;
also utilize appropriate public participation mechanisms such as interviews, round tables, and&#13;
discussions with groups affected by a given environmental problem. The preparation of&#13;
specific TORs for preliminary studies in which alternative solutions to the priority problems&#13;
identified at this stage will also be determined. Three types of studies are envisaged: (a)&#13;
priority studies relating to environmental problems needing immediate resolution; (b) a study&#13;
defining the long-term strategy with regard to current environmental problems, to ensure that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
the existing conditions do not deteriorate further; and (c) a study defining the medium- and&#13;
long-term strategies to resolve emerging environmental problems. In this case, preventive&#13;
measures, legal reform and institutional priorities would be suggested, which may lead to&#13;
further studies, for example, on new institutional arrangements or the design of economic&#13;
instruments.&#13;
87.   The Second Stage in preparing the SEAP should last about 12 months and would&#13;
consist of: (a) the execution of studies identified during the first stage. These studies will be&#13;
carried out by the appropriate technical working groups, with the support of the specialized&#13;
consultants; and (b) the review and approval of the completed studies by the government.&#13;
Political support and confirmation of respective political decisions will have to be sought to&#13;
ensure that the recommended action to resolve an environmental problem is actually taken.&#13;
88.   The Third Stage would have a duration of 3-6 months and would involve: (a) the&#13;
preparation of a report on the SEAP based on the conclusions of the studies and the&#13;
agreements obtained through the consultative process. The SEAP will serve to orient&#13;
environmental management, assign specific responsibilities to agencies, and propose&#13;
environmental projects, together with their respective budgets. It will also assist to orient the&#13;
environmental activities and responsibility of the private sector and the NGOs; and (b) the&#13;
elaboration of the priority investment projects in order to present them to possible financing&#13;
sources. This development of SEAP will be managed by the Department of Forests and&#13;
Environment and the Gujarat Ecology Commission under direct supervision of the high level&#13;
Advisory Committee. The project would support the overall institutional development effort&#13;
in Gujarat by financing about 40 staff months of expatriate consultant services; over 1800&#13;
staff months of local consultants; about 70 staff months of overseas training; and over 400&#13;
staff months of in-country training; equipment and materials.&#13;
G.   Project Costs and Financing&#13;
89.   The total cost of the project, including duties and taxes is estimated at Rs. 2,619.0&#13;
million or US$61.48 million equivalent. The breakdown of costs of the proposed project by&#13;
component and categories of expenditure is summarized in Schedule B of the Memorandum&#13;
of the President.&#13;
90.   The estimated total project cost of US$61.48 million would be financed by an IDA&#13;
Credit of SDR 34.7 million (US$50.0 million equivalent) which would cover about 82 % of&#13;
costs net of taxes. Duties and taxes are estimated to be equivalent to US$0.84 million. The&#13;
GOI would finance the remaining net costs of and all taxes. The financing plan by project&#13;
component and by categories of expenditure is outlined in Schedule B of the Memorandum of&#13;
the President.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
37&#13;
3. PROJECT ADMINISTRATION&#13;
A. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION/COORDINATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
91.   The Ministry of Environment and Forests would be responsible for ensuring overall&#13;
coordination among the various ministries and institutions involved in the implementation of&#13;
the project. A National Steering Committee, chaired by the Secretary, MOEF and including&#13;
the Secretary of the Department of Ocean Development, the Chairman of the Central Pollution&#13;
Control Board; the Chief Secretary, Gujarat or his representative, and a representative from&#13;
the Department of Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance, has been established to ensure the&#13;
timely flow of funds, orderly reporting on project implementation, and the resolution of&#13;
implementation issues as soon as they arise. The National Steering Committee would be&#13;
serviced by a Project Cell which has been established in the MOEF with responsibilities for&#13;
coordinating procurement, disbursements, accounting, and monitoring of project progress and&#13;
impact. During negotiations, the government provided an assurances that it would: (a) carry&#13;
out the project in accordance with an implementation plan satisfactory to the Association; and&#13;
(b) maintain the NSC and Expert Committees (paras. 95, 100, 101) each with membership and&#13;
terms of reference satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
92.   The organization chart of the MOEF (Attachment 2 Figure 3) shows that it is&#13;
structured around a number of specialized Divisions. The government has confirmed that&#13;
specific sub-components (Paras. 40-50; 53-55; and 62-76) will be directly managed by the&#13;
MOEF or under the coordination of MOEF.&#13;
93.   The Environmental Research Division would ensure that the technical assistance&#13;
program (para. 40) covers the local universities and research institutions involved in the&#13;
Environmnent Research Program. Institutional linkages would be established with international&#13;
environmental research institutions.&#13;
94.   The Environment Information Division would be the focal point for the environmental&#13;
information subcomponent (paras. 41-42). Only local consultants would be required to work&#13;
closely with the existing ENVIS Centers which include among others, the CPCB; the&#13;
Industrial Toxicology Research Center, Development Alternatives (an NGO); Center for&#13;
Environment studies, Anna University; Tata Energy Research Institute; Center for Ecological&#13;
Sciences; the World Wide Fund for Nature -India; Environmental Planning and Coordination&#13;
Organization; National Institute of Occupational Health; Central Arid Zone Research Institute;&#13;
Center for Advanced Studies in Marine Biology; NEERI; G. B. Pant Institute of Himalayan&#13;
Environment and Development; and the School of Planning and Architecture.&#13;
95.   Since under the project an Environmental Economics Indicators, and Project Planning&#13;
Cell is to be established in the MOEF, the environmental economics subcomponent (paras.&#13;
43-44) would be initially managed by an Expert Committee which has been established by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
MOEF and includes representatives from the core group of environmental economic institutes&#13;
in India. These include the Madras School of Economics which will be the coordinating&#13;
institution; the Indira Gandhi Institute of Development Research; the Institute of Economic&#13;
Growth; and the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy. A second group of interested&#13;
universities and institutes, such as the Delhi School of Economics, the Gokale Institute of&#13;
Politics and Economics, the India Institute of Technology, Bombay; the Jawaharlal Nehru&#13;
University Center for Environmental Sciences,; the Administrative Staff College, Hyderabad;&#13;
the School for Social and Economic Change in Bangalore will also be involved. During&#13;
negotiations, the government provided an assurance that by August 31, 1997 it would&#13;
establish and thereafter maintain an Environmental Economics, Indicators, and Project&#13;
Planning Cell (EEIPPC) with terms of reference satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
96.   The Environmental Indicators and Indices subcomponent (paras. 46-48) would be&#13;
centered in the EEIPPC and International Cooperation Division of the MOEF, and the&#13;
Departments of Finance, and Forests and Environment in Gujarat. Expatriate and local&#13;
consultants would work with these Divisions/Departments and other Indian Universities to&#13;
develop the Indicators and Indices similar to indicators developed for China, Indonesia,&#13;
Pakistan, Nepal, Philippines, and the Marshall Islands by the Asian Development Bank and&#13;
the Government of Norway. During negotiations, the government provided assurances that it&#13;
would: (a) cause the MOEF and Gujarat to prepare environmental indicators and indices by&#13;
December 31, 1998, (b) cause MOEF and Gujarat to employ the indicators and indices in the&#13;
evaluation of investment projects by April 30, 1999; and (c) ensure that MOEF and Gujarat&#13;
would publish annual environment status reports employing the indicators and indices&#13;
developed by April 30, 1999.&#13;
97.   The MOEF's Regional Office Division at the center would manage the technical&#13;
assistance program which is targeted at strengthening the six Regional Offices in the&#13;
monitoring of EIA compliance. (para. 49). For strengthening the regional offices it is expected&#13;
that most of the technical assistance would be local consultants. During negotiations, the&#13;
government provided assurances that it would by December 31, 1997, complete the review (of&#13;
the functions, staffing, workload, and location); and commence the implementation of a plan&#13;
(including the appointment of additional staff, training of new and existing staff, and the&#13;
opening of additional Regional Offices if necessary) satisfactory to the Association to&#13;
strengthen the Regional Offices of the MOEF.&#13;
98.   The MOEF would also coordinate the implementation of the National Environmental&#13;
Awareness Campaign (paras 53-54), and Paryavaran Vahini program (para. 55). The&#13;
Environmental Education and Information Division in conjunction with the Center for&#13;
Environmental Education, Ahmedabad, C. P. Rama Aiyar Environmental Education Center,&#13;
and a wide range of NGOs would implement the NEAC and Paryavaran Vahini sub-&#13;
components.&#13;
99.   The MOEF has informed IDA of its intention to establish and maintain an&#13;
Implementation Cell headed by a full-time legal academic to be responsible for the&#13;
coordination and implementation of the environmental law subcomponent (paras. 62-67).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
During negotiations, the government provided an assurance that it would take the necesssary&#13;
steps to strengthen the legal capacity of MOEF, CPCB, and SPCBs in accordance with a plan&#13;
satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
100.  The Central Pollution Control Board is another focal point for the receipt of, and&#13;
managing the implementation of technical assistance. It will be directly responsible for the&#13;
sub-components i.e. environmental standards (para. 45); industry siting/zonal atlas (paras. 74-&#13;
75); and expanding ambient air pollution monitoring (para. 76). Since the CPCB is a recipient&#13;
of technical assistance under the on-going Industrial Pollution Control and Industrial Pollution&#13;
Prevention projects, it is familiar with IDA procedures and requirements. It is expected that&#13;
the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (GTZ) which has had a long-standing&#13;
relationship with the CPCB and has placed a number of long-term expatriate experts in CPCB&#13;
will be retained to assist in the implementation of the zonal atlas and ambient air monitoring&#13;
subcomponents.&#13;
101.  For the monitoring of compliance in the mining sector (paras. 68-73), the Division on&#13;
Mining in the MOEF would be responsible for the review of policies, standards and&#13;
enforcement mechanisms, and the Center for Mining and Environment would be responsible&#13;
for the design and implementation of demonstration projects. The government has established&#13;
an Expert Committee for the Mining Sector with representatives from the various institutes&#13;
involved in mining planning. These include the Central Mine Planning and Design Institute,&#13;
Central Mining Research Institute, the Indian School of Mines (Deemed University); Center&#13;
for Mining Environment; the Environmental Planning and Coordination Organization; the&#13;
Mineral Exploration Corporation; the Indian Bureau of Mines; and the Neyveli Lignite&#13;
Corporation.&#13;
102.  During negotiations, the government confirmed that the Department of Ocean&#13;
Development would implement the technical assistance program for the development of&#13;
integrated coastal and marine area management (paras. 77-82). It would establish a Project&#13;
Implementation Cell. It is expected that this program will require a significant amount of&#13;
expatriate specialist services and training. A "twining' relationship with one of the&#13;
internationally renowned oceanographic research and training institutions will be undertaken.&#13;
103.  During negotiations, the government confirmed that the Department of Forests and&#13;
Environment, Gujarat, with assistance from the Gujarat Ecology Commission; and the Gujarat&#13;
Pollution Control Board would be responsible for the implementation of the Gujarat&#13;
components of the project (paras. 83-88). Project funds would flow directly from the MOEF&#13;
to these Gujarat institutions. During negotiations, Gujarat agreed that it would establish by&#13;
August 31, 1997 and maintain a Project Implementation Cell in the Department of Forests and&#13;
Environment with responsibility to supervise the implementation of the project, with&#13;
membership and terms of reference satisfactory to the Association. Institutional linkages with&#13;
Environmental Protection Agencies to implement exchange, training, and expert&#13;
assistance programs is being considered. The NGO Environmental Action Fund will be&#13;
managed by COMNEAF (para. 59) as determined by the Gujarat Department of Forests and&#13;
Environment. Criteria have been developed for the management of the Funds as well as for&#13;
&#13;

NGOs access to the Fund. During negotiations, the government provided assurances that, it&#13;
would cause Gujarat to (a) establish, maintain, and operate commencing August 31, 1997, an&#13;
NGO Environmental Action Fund in accordance with arrangements and a time schedule&#13;
acceptable to the Association; (b) prepare a State Environment Action Program (SEAP) by&#13;
March 31, 1999; and (c) carry out the project in accordance with an implementation plan&#13;
satisfactory to the Association. The project implementation process is outlined in Figure 1.&#13;
B. PROCUREMENT&#13;
104. Goods and Equipment (US$10.35 million). Goods, in particular computers,&#13;
laboratory and scientific equipment would be procured using International Competitive&#13;
Bidding (ICB) procedures. However equipment estimated to cost less than US$200,000 per&#13;
package up to an aggregate of US$2.00 million equivalent would be procured using National&#13;
Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures. Standard Bidding Documents (January 1995) and&#13;
procedures in accordance with Bank Guidelines for Procurement (January 1995) would be&#13;
used. For procurement under ICB procedures, national manufacturers would be granted a&#13;
margin of preference in accordance with Bank Guidelines. Small items of equipment would be&#13;
procured by the various agencies in small lots over the project period. Individual contracts are&#13;
not expected to exceed US$25,000 and as such would be procured using Shopping procedures&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, up to an aggregate amount of US$8.00 million equivalent. Rate contracts&#13;
of the Directorate General of Supplies and Disposal (DGS&amp;D), New Delhi would only be&#13;
acceptable as a substitute for procurement under Shopping, Training Materials and Books,&#13;
(periodicals, proprietary equipment/software, training materials and spare parts compatible&#13;
with existing equipment) valued at about US$2.01 million would be procured under Direct&#13;
Contracting procedures.&#13;
105.  Technical Assistance (Consultants, Contractual Staff, and Training): (US$53.95&#13;
million). Consultancies contractual and services for training would be provided by firms,&#13;
specialized training institutions and professional trainers (expatriate as well as local) and&#13;
would be hired following procedures presented in Bank Guidelines for use of Consultants&#13;
(August 1981) and use of Standard Forms of Contract for Consultants Services( June 1995)&#13;
and other models developed by the Bank from time to time.&#13;
106.  Contract Review. All goods and equipment contracts valued at US$200,000&#13;
equivalent and above and the first three contracts (proposed for competitive bidding -&#13;
regardless of value) would be subject to prior review by IDA as per procedure outlined in&#13;
Appendix 1 of Bank Guidelines. It is expected that this will result in prior review of about&#13;
40% of contracts awarded under ICB/NCB. Selective post-review of awarded contracts below&#13;
the threshold levels would be carried out by visiting review missions. Consultant contracts of&#13;
value exceeding US$100,000 equivalent per contract for consulting firms and US$50,000&#13;
equivalent for individuals, and the first contract for each Ministry/Executive Agency,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
regardless of value, would be subject to prior review. However prior review would be required&#13;
for:&#13;
(a)   all consultant contracts above US$100,000 for firms and US$50,000 for&#13;
individuals;&#13;
(b)   terms of reference for all contracts (regardless of value);&#13;
(c)   single source contracts, regardless of value (not applicable to contracts for&#13;
individuals);&#13;
(d)   all consultant contracts for assignments of a critical nature, regardless of value;&#13;
(e)   contract amendments valued at more than US$100,000 and US$50,000&#13;
equivalent for firms and individuals respectively or those that raise the total&#13;
contract value above these thresholds; and&#13;
(f)   any standard documents that the borrower intends to develop and use&#13;
repeatedly.&#13;
(g)   It is estimated that about 50% by value of the consultant contracts and training&#13;
services would be prior reviewed.&#13;
107. Procurement Arrangements. The Ministry of Environment and Forest (MOEF) has&#13;
agreed to acquire the services of a Procurement Agent for procurement of goods and&#13;
consultant services under the project. Procurement of a major share of the goods and&#13;
equipment, and hiring of consultants for training and the provision of expert services, would&#13;
be made by the Project Implementation Cell in MOEF with the assistance of the Procurement&#13;
Agent. Approval of contracts would be the responsibility of the Secretary of the respective&#13;
Ministry which is directly responsible for the implementation of the subcomponent assisted by&#13;
the technical and financial staff from the said Ministry and the Procurement Agent. The&#13;
Procurement Agent would also work closely with the Project Implementation Cells in the&#13;
Department of Ocean Development and in the Gujarat Department of Forests and&#13;
Environment to ensure that agreed bidding documents and procedures are used for the&#13;
procurement of all IDA-financed goods and services which are not procured centrally; and&#13;
that the accounts and documentation are maintained in a manner acceptable to IDA. The&#13;
government has prepared a procurement schedule for goods and equipment, showing the&#13;
packages and the timing of various procurement activities; draft bidding document along with&#13;
specifications etc. for the packages for which bids are to be invited in the first year of&#13;
implementation. The project elements, their estimated costs and the proposed methods of&#13;
procurement are summarized in Table 1. Figures in parentheses are the respective amounts to&#13;
be financed through the IDA Credit:&#13;

C.    DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
108. The proposed credit of SDR 34.7 million (US$50.0 million equivalent) will be&#13;
disbursed over a period of six years. This is realistic given the design of the project, and&#13;
especially because it involves the bringing to scale of several already completed pilot projects&#13;
as well as the gradual expansion of a number of on-going programs. The standard Bank-wide&#13;
disbursement profile for Technical Assistance projects is six and a half years.&#13;
109.  The Association will reimburse the Government for eligible expenditures incurred by&#13;
project agencies at a rate of 91% (100% for expatriate consultants, 85% for local consultants)&#13;
for all local and foreign expenditures on expert services, 91% (100% for overseas training,&#13;
85% for in-country training) for training, 40% for books and other training materials, and 40&#13;
percent for equipment. Disbursements in respect of contracts for goods and services estimated&#13;
to cost less than US$200,000 equivalent would be made against Statements of Expenditure&#13;
(SOEs) certified by the MOEF and retained by the Ministry of Environment and Forests, the&#13;
Department of Ocean Development, the Central Pollution Control Board, and the Department&#13;
of Forests and Environment, Gujarat, and made available for review by IDA during the course&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
of supervision missions. All other disbursements would be made against fully-documented&#13;
withdrawal applications.&#13;
110.  In order to accelerate disbursements in respect of the Association's share of&#13;
expenditures pre-financed by the government, and in order to allow for direct payment of&#13;
other eligible local and foreign expenditures, a Special Account would be opened in the&#13;
Reserve Bank of India with an initial deposit of US$3.0 million equivalent to cover four&#13;
months of expected requirements for IDA financed items. The full amount of the authorized&#13;
allocation may be requested when withdrawals and commitments from the credit account are&#13;
equal to or exceed the equivalent of US$ 10.0 million. The project is expected to be completed&#13;
by December 31, 2002, and closed by June 30, 2003. The allocation of credit proceeds and the&#13;
estimated credit disbursement schedule are shown in Tables 2 and 3. A forecast of&#13;
expenditures and disbursements is shown in Table 4.&#13;

D.   ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING&#13;
111.   The Ministry of Environment and Forests and the other key project implementing&#13;
agencies i.e. DOD; CPCB, and Gujarat Department of Forests and Environment will establish&#13;
separate accounts to record eligible project expenditures and to allow for monitoring of&#13;
financial operations under the project. The Project Cell in Gujarat would prepare a&#13;
consolidated account for all project activities in the state. The Project Cell in MOEF will&#13;
prepare a consolidated project account. The project would be subject to normal government&#13;
accounting and auditing procedures which are considered satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
During negotiations, the government provided assurances that: (a) accounts and financial&#13;
statements for each fiscal year would be prepared and audited by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Association; (b) statements of expenditure would be maintained in&#13;
accordance with sound accounting practices, be maintained at least one year after the&#13;
completion of the audit for the fiscal year in which the last withdrawal was made and a&#13;
separate opinion on Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) be included in the annual audit; and&#13;
(c) certified copies of audited accounts and financial statements for each fiscal year, together&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
with the Auditor's Report would be furnished to the Association as soon as available, but not&#13;
later than six months after the end of each fiscal year starting with the audit reports for the&#13;
financial year ending March 31, 1997.&#13;
E.   MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
112.  The Ministry of Environment and Forests will be responsible for the monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of the project. Special annual outcomes and indicators to monitor progress in&#13;
project implementation and to assess project impact have been agreed with the government&#13;
and are outlined in Schedule D of the Memorandum of the President. The Project&#13;
Implementation Cell in the MOEF with the assistance of local consultants will prepare&#13;
quarterly progress reports and collect from the other implementing agencies, all additional&#13;
documentation required for the supervision of the project. During negotiations, the&#13;
government provided assurances that it would cause the MOEF and Gujarat to (a) review&#13;
annually with the Association, progress in the implementation of the project and credit&#13;
disbursements over the preceeding twelve months; (b) discuss with the Association by March&#13;
31 of each year, annual work plans and budgets for the next twelve months; (c) carry out with&#13;
the Association, a mid-term review of the project no later than March 31, 1999; and (d) duly&#13;
take into account, the comments offered by the Association during the mid-term review in the&#13;
course of further implementation. It was also understood that at the Mid-Term Review not&#13;
only project progress would be evaluated, but project impact indicators reviewed and updated,&#13;
and a decision taken jointly by GOI and IDA on the processing of a second phase technical&#13;
assistance project to further support the pilots which have been evaluated as being successful.&#13;
An Implementation Completion Report (ICR) will be submitted to the Association by the&#13;
MOEF no later than six months after completion of the project i.e. by June 30, 2003. During&#13;
negotiations, the government also provided assurances that it would (a) prepare on the basis of&#13;
guidelines acceptable to the Association, and furnish to the Association no later than six&#13;
months after the Closing Date, a plan designed to ensure the continued achievement of project&#13;
objectives, and (b) ensure the Association a reasonable opportunity to exchange views on this&#13;
plan.&#13;

G.    PROJECT SUPERVISION PLAN&#13;
114. The Approach. Project implementation will follow the "implement-review design-&#13;
implement" approach. This is appropriate for a technical assistance operation. Selected&#13;
assessments and action plans would be developed during the first one to two years in order to&#13;
better focus environmental policy actions and project implementation in the following years.&#13;
The technical assistance activities and supervision plan would be flexible enough to respond&#13;
to priority actions and changing institutional structures as they evolve over the life of the&#13;
project.&#13;
115.  Bank Supervision Inputs. Several aspects of the supervision plan are worth noting.&#13;
The "implement-review-design-implement" approach will require the supervision team to&#13;
address on-going design issues, and will require more time than required for the supervision of&#13;
physical investment projects. As a result, supervision costs for this project will be higher than&#13;
current coefficients for investment projects in India because: (a) activities will be front-end&#13;
loaded over the first two years; (b) the importance of a comprehensive Project Launch; (c) the&#13;
wide range of skills required during supervision ; and (d) the establishment of a Core&#13;
Advisory Group of Bank staff specialists from the Economic Development Institute (EDI),&#13;
Environment Department (ENV), Policy Research Department (PRD), Environment Division&#13;
Legal Department (LEGEN) and the Environment Division, Asia Technical Department&#13;
(ASTEN).&#13;
116.  The supervision plan has been divided between inputs from headquarters and from the&#13;
New Delhi Office of the World Bank (NDO). NDO has an important supervisory role for this&#13;
project. Their involvement, especially during the first two years, will be ongoing, rather than&#13;
driven by discrete supervision missions from Washington. The continuous engagement of&#13;
NDO staff with the GOI is essential to making this project a successful long-term partnership.&#13;
NDO staff will work closely with the Project Cell in the MOEF in the areas of: (a) monitoring&#13;
of project progress against agreed Key Indicators; (b) preparation and review of quarterly&#13;
progress reports; (c) the 'twinning' arrangements between local and foreign institutions; (d)&#13;
linkages between the project and NGOs and other elements of civil society; and (e)&#13;
assessments of the quality of training programs and workshops.&#13;

117. Borrower Contribution to Project Supervision. Quarterly Progress Reports will be&#13;
prepared and submitted to the Bank by the Project Cell in MOEF. Overall responsibilities for&#13;
project monitoring, reporting and evaluation will reside with the Project Cell. However, the&#13;
implementing agencies more directly responsible for each project subcomponent will be&#13;
responsible for reporting on progress against input and output indicators, financial targets, and&#13;
performance indicators. The contents and form of these supervision reports will be determined&#13;
by the Project Cell. Also, the Project Cell will be responsible for coordinating arrangements&#13;
for Bank supervision missions and for providing information required.&#13;
118.  Mid-Term  Review.  This project is conceived of as Phase I of a longer-term&#13;
relationship between the GOI and the World Bank in the area of environmental management.&#13;
The mid-term review for this project will suggest not only changes the implementation of this&#13;
project, but will recommend whether the Bank should proceed with the design of a second&#13;
Environmental Management Capacity Building Technical Assistance project. Both the Key&#13;
Indicators and the Supervision Plan have been drafted to allow for the Mid-Term Review to&#13;
fulfill this function.&#13;
119.  Estimated staffing levels and costs.  The attached tables provide details on the&#13;
Supervision Plan. Since it is unrealistic to plan separate supervision missions for each&#13;
component, the plan reflects that (a) the NDO will take a strong role, and (b) the mission&#13;
schedule is only tentative after the first project year. Also, to explicitly recognize the&#13;
importance of the Core Advisory Committee in Headquarters, a line for 'non-mission&#13;
supervision' is included in the Plan. It is estimated that project supervision by Bank staff will&#13;
require about 330 staff-weeks over the life of project, of which about 150 will be by&#13;
headquarters staff and 180 by NDO staff. The average supervision cost over the life of the&#13;
project is estimated to be $134,000 per year. Estimated staff-weeks per fiscal year and a&#13;
summary supervision plan staff weeks are shown in Table 6 and 7.&#13;

H.   PROJECT BENEFIT ANALYSIS&#13;
120.  Framework.  The proposed project is designed to assist GOI in meeting its&#13;
environmental priorities. It is linked to the India Country Assistance Strategy and completed&#13;
economic and sector work prepared by the India, Nepal, Bhutan, Country Department, South&#13;
Asia Regional Office (SA2), which has been discussed and agreed with GOI. In December&#13;
1993, The Environmental Action Program - India (EAP) was issued by the MOEF. One of&#13;
the major objectives in preparing the EAP was to "identify projects for organizational&#13;
strengthening for better environmental management" (para. 1.02(e) of the EAP). The Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for India, dated May 19, 1995, specifically noted that the Bank&#13;
would discuss possible environmental projects to strengthen the capabilities of institutions and&#13;
agencies in charge of formulating and implementing environmental policies and monitoring&#13;
and strengthening compliance (para. 70 of CAS). The January 1996 SA2 study which&#13;
assessed the EAP concluded that institutional capacity building to strengthen monitoring and&#13;
compliance with existing laws and standards has a high payoff and in addition, that&#13;
decentralization of environmental management to communities and non-governmental&#13;
organizations is critically important to the overall environmental management process. (para.&#13;
14 of MOP).&#13;
121.  Macro/Sector Environment.   Macroeconomic and sectoral preconditions are&#13;
satisfactory for this project. While the project is not linked to specific policy reforms, it is&#13;
designed to address the key information, policy, and compliance issues that hinder broad-&#13;
based improvements in environmental management in India. This point can be illustrated by&#13;
noting that there are four underlying causes of environmental degradation in India:6 (a)&#13;
market and policy failures; (b) population growth; (c) rapid urbanization and industrialization;&#13;
and (d) the common perception, caused in part by the lack of information to both government&#13;
and civil society, that there is a direct tradeoff between environmental protection and&#13;
economic growth. The project is designed to address some of these underlying causes&#13;
directly, while leaving others such as population growth as "givens" within the project time-&#13;
frame. In particular, the subcomponents on environmental law, economics, research, and&#13;
community and NGO action, all are designed to address key areas of economy-wide policy&#13;
failure. The subcomponents on mining, ambient air monitoring, industrial siting, coastal and&#13;
marine area management, and strengthening environmental impact assessment (EIA)&#13;
compliance, are intended to enhance programs to reduce the adverse impacts of rapid&#13;
urbanization and industrialization. Finally, the emphasis on environmental information,&#13;
indicators and indices, and community awareness, highlights the importance of public&#13;
involvement in designing and implementing solutions to environmental issues.&#13;
122.  Several important policy issues that hinder improved environmental management in&#13;
India are considered beyond the scope of this project. The most important of these are: (a)&#13;
energy pricing, including the price of fossil fuels and electricity; (b) water pricing; and (c)&#13;
community resource tenure on degraded lands. These issues are all being addressed through&#13;
other Bank/IDA-assisted projects (Schedule A of Memorandum of the President). More&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
53&#13;
specifically, under the Industrial Pollution Prevention project (FY95), MOEF begun the&#13;
review of the fiscal and regulatory incentives for pollution control in industry. As part of this&#13;
effort, the National Institute for Public Finance and Policy (NIPFP) completed a study:&#13;
"Incentives and Regulations for Pollution Abatement with an Application to Waste Water&#13;
Treatment". The study was a first step towards exploring introduction of market-based&#13;
instruments for industrial pollution abatement. The study recommended four approaches:&#13;
(a) abatement charges with government clean-up; (b) abatement charges with third-party&#13;
clean-up; (c) tax/subsidy schemes; and (d) tradable private permits system. MOEF foresaw&#13;
the need for an additional review of these issues and organized a task force to explore wider&#13;
use of economic instruments. Further analysis of these approaches is required before concrete&#13;
Governmental action can be taken. Task force is now carrying out further analysis of market-&#13;
based instruments for pollution abatement under terms of reference agreed with the Bank. An&#13;
implementation program for the use of such instruments will be a part of this analysis.&#13;
123. Public/Private Sector Issues. In India, there is general agreement on the broad&#13;
principle that public sector involvement should be strengthened only in areas which cannot be&#13;
adequately covered by the private sector, representative and capable local community&#13;
organizations, and NGOs. However, the manner in which this principle is applied in specific&#13;
sectors, and within the various tasks of environmental management--i.e. policy formulation,&#13;
investment, monitoring, compliance--can benefit from additional analytical work and more&#13;
informed public debate. This project will address this gap at several levels through the&#13;
environmental  law,  environmental  economics,  environmental  research,  National&#13;
Environmental Awareness Campaign, Paryavaran Vahinis, and NGO Environmental Action&#13;
Fund. The combined benefits of these subcomponents will be the broadening of support for&#13;
improved environmental management from a small core of bureaucrats within government, to&#13;
a much broader base in society at large, that will also incorporate a system of checks and&#13;
balances in policy planning, monitoring, and compliance.&#13;
124. Project Choice. The Bank Group has two choices to increase its cooperation with&#13;
India on the environment. These are either sectoral investment projects in priority sectors&#13;
such as water management, energy development, urban management, industrial pollution&#13;
prevention, forestry, and biodiversity conservation; and/or 'umbrella' technical assistance&#13;
projects which addresses the institutional weaknesses that underlie the broad range of priority&#13;
environmental issues identified by the GOI in its EAP. Many Bank Group borrowers&#13;
including China, Russia, Indonesia, Brazil, Mexico, and Chile, have recognized the need for&#13;
umbrella technical assistance projects.&#13;
125. As outlined in Schedule A of the Memorandum of the President, the GOI has an active&#13;
portfolio of Bank Group-assisted investment projects with positive environmental impacts. It&#13;
does not have an umbrella project that addresses the institutional and policy weaknesses which&#13;
are common to priority-setting and resource management issues across sectors. This project&#13;
fills that gap. The project will benefit ongoing sectoral projects that have environmental&#13;
components such as the Industrial Pollution Control and Industrial Pollution Prevention&#13;
projects, by improving the efficiency of the policy, monitoring, and compliance regime that&#13;
affects the investment decisions under those projects. In addition, it will assist in improving&#13;
the pre-conditions for future environmental projects, such as the proposed Urban (Delhi and&#13;
Surat) Environmental Management (FY99) and the Hazardous Waste Management (FY97)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
54&#13;
projects. Therefore, the benefits derived from the various project components will accrue to&#13;
the policy planning and administration, monitoring and compliance, and decentralized&#13;
environmental management needs of future Bank Group operations in India.&#13;
126. Impact. Current economic analysis practice does not allow for the quantification of&#13;
the long-term benefits of Technical Assistance projects. Instead, in order to ensure a high rate&#13;
of return on the technical assistance resources devoted to this type of project, the Operations&#13;
Evaluation Department (OED) recommendations, based on audit reports of Technical&#13;
Assistance projects have been followed.7  For environmental technical assistance projects,&#13;
OED's recommendations place importance on three preconditions: (a) adequate institutional&#13;
and technical capabilities are needed at the national and sub-national levels; (b)&#13;
implementation of environmental projects require adequate technical information, a&#13;
supportive policy environment, and adequate institutional capacity; and (c) environmental&#13;
regulations have to be accompanied by greater reliance on economic incentives. The proposed&#13;
project gives importance to lessening India's shortcomings in these areas. In particular, the&#13;
process of institutional capacity-building will be underpinned by improved data collection and&#13;
analysis capabilities, economy-environment policy linkages, increased involvement of the&#13;
community and NGOs, the academic sector, and the expansion of resources available in&#13;
Gujarat for environmental management. Beyond these general observations, several of the&#13;
projects subcomponents have positive economic and environmental benefits in the short,&#13;
medium, and long term which can be analyzed separately. They are shown in Table 8.&#13;

127. Mining Sector. India is a large producer of coal and the bulk of India's energy needs&#13;
in the future will be met by coal-based thermal power. Coal-based thermal generation&#13;
capacity is expected to rise from 63,000 MW by the end of the Eighth Five-Year Plan period&#13;
(1996) to about 144,000 MW by 2010--an increase of 81,000 MW over a period of 14 years.&#13;
Higher and consistent coal quality will increase generation efficiency and plant availability.&#13;
For example, washed coal reduces carbon dioxide emissions from 0.983 to 0.866 kilograms&#13;
per kilowatt hour. Even a one percent improvement in plant capacity as a result of coal&#13;
washeries will improve generation capacity by 600 MW by the end of the Eighth Five-Year&#13;
Plan for a saving of US$720 million. The carbon dioxide savings potential is estimated as 5&#13;
percent of 63,000 MW of coal-based generation capacity at the existing average plant load&#13;
factors. It could have been 15 million tons (assuming 55 percent plant load factor and 0.983&#13;
kilograms of carbon dioxide emissions per kilowatt hour). The potential savings would have&#13;
been US$3.8 billion. This is one example of the benefits from undertaking Mitigation&#13;
measures in the mining and energy sectors.&#13;
128. Because of GOI's concerns about the adverse environmental impacts of mining, the&#13;
MOEF established in 1987. A Center for Mining Environment in Dhanbad, Bihar, which is at&#13;
the heart of India's coal belt. The objective of the Center is generate scientific data and build&#13;
national capacity for sustainable mining in the country. Although this Center has developed&#13;
expertise in managing environmental issues in the mining sector, its competence has not been&#13;
matched by development of management capacities in the numerous agencies involved in the&#13;
supervision and monitoring of mining projects. These include the state Departments of&#13;
Geology and Mining, Environment and Forests, State Pollution Control Boards, and at the&#13;
Center, the CPCB, MOEF, and the Indian Bureau of Mines. The project would enhance the&#13;
capacities of these institutions. This should be environmentally beneficial to coal mining&#13;
specifically and mining in general.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58&#13;
129.  The environmental costs associated with current mining practices include air pollution,&#13;
water pollution, and the opportunity cost of degraded lands which are left in previously mined&#13;
areas. Since none of the economic values of these impacts have been quantified, it is not&#13;
possible to quantify the benefits accruing to improved practices attributable to this project.&#13;
However, as compliance to mining sector Environmental Mitigation Plans (EMPs) improve as&#13;
a result of this project i.e. strengthening the Regional Offices of the MOEF and SPCBs and&#13;
other parallel activities such as the recently approved Coal India Environmental and Social&#13;
Mitigation Project, the cost to society of the negative environrmental and economic impacts&#13;
will decline. Best practice in other countries, including Indonesia and Australia, has shown&#13;
the cost-effectiveness of the combined mining sector mitigation strategies included in the Coal&#13;
India Environmental and Social Mitigation project and the proposed project.&#13;
130.  Industrial Siting. There are two costs associated with current practice in India of&#13;
largely uncontrolled industrial siting with few land-use controls.  The first cost is the&#13;
environmental cost. This is an economic externality of excess pollution in areas where there&#13;
is insufficient carrying capacity. The second cost is the higher economic cost which is due to&#13;
the loss of possible economies of scale associated with providing adequate pollution&#13;
abatement equipment to industry that is widely dispersed. The industrial siting/zonal atlas&#13;
subcomponent will expand ongoing GOI efforts to improve industrial siting and should lead to&#13;
a reduction of the environmental and economic costs already prevalent in the economy&#13;
because of inadequate and inappropriate industrial siting.&#13;
131.  Coastal and Marine Area Management. India has extensive coastlines (0.13 million&#13;
sq. km of territorial waters). In keeping with its own laws and obligations under international&#13;
environmental conventions, India monitors coastal and marine area pollution. The major&#13;
coastal and marine area problems are growing microbial pollution indicating wide-scale&#13;
sewage and industrial pollution, exploitation of mangroves leading to erosion of coastal land,&#13;
the destruction of ideal habitats for marine life and breeding grounds for fish, intrusion of&#13;
saline water into coastal acquifers rendering coastal lands more prone to flooding, and the&#13;
pollution of the sea by oil spills and ship wastes. Studies by the Department of Ocean&#13;
Development and the CPCB have shown large scale pollution in the coastal areas, especially&#13;
the creek waters on the western coasts, particularly in Gujarat and Maharashtra. CPCB has&#13;
estimated that about 135 billion metric tons of sediment and 32 billion metric tons of soluble&#13;
matter enter into the ocean through the various rivers of India. While the Indian rivers carry&#13;
five percent of all the water that flows into the world's seas, they also carry thirty-five percent&#13;
of all sediments. Given the polluting nature of Indian's rivers, the overall impact of such&#13;
pollution is enormous on India's coastal and marine areas as well as the seas. The proposed&#13;
coastal and marine area management subcomponent will directly address many aspects of&#13;
coastal pollution and degradation in India. If successful, not only will monitoring of pollution&#13;
be improved, but the management plans which the states will prepare, should lead to&#13;
reductions in marine pollution, and the protection of coastal wetlands, mangroves, coral reefs,&#13;
and marine habitats.&#13;
132.  Environmental Policy Planning. This project subcomponent has as its objective the&#13;
strengthening of environmental policy planning through better economic analysis, research&#13;
and information, new and upgraded environmental standards, and the development of&#13;
environmental indicators and indices. India is currently hindered by both environmental&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59&#13;
policy failures due to the distortionary effects of pricing policies, and inefficiencies due to&#13;
policy regimes that while well-intentioned, could be reformed for greater efficiency. The&#13;
proposed will concentrate on improving the efficiency of sub-optimal environmental policies&#13;
and practices. The benefits of this project component will be to: (a) reduce the marginal cost&#13;
of compliance, relative to current practices, through increased use of cost-effectiveness criteria&#13;
in policy planning. This includes the cost of all environmental investments required to meet&#13;
standards; (b) reduce the cost of effective government oversight over the environment, relative&#13;
to current trends, because of the greater role to be played by civil society in environmental&#13;
monitoring and compliance; and (c) reduce the long-term cost of improved environmental&#13;
management, relative to current trends, by increasing the adoption of precautionary measures&#13;
as opposed to clean-up operations.&#13;
133.  Decentralization of Environmental Management. The project would support a&#13;
concerted effort to improve and expand the role of civil society i.e. beneficiaries, elected local&#13;
bodies, non-governmental organizations, and other grassroots organizations in the&#13;
environmental management system  in India.  The project would integrate splintered&#13;
environmental initiatives such as the Nation Environmental Awareness Campaign, Paryavaran&#13;
Vahini, and others into a focused and thematic program of behavior change that would evolve&#13;
from "raising awareness" to action.&#13;
134. Environmental Administration. The benefits from improved administration would&#13;
be both visible and demonstrable in the short-term. Strengthened Regional Offices of the&#13;
MOEF and SPCBs will be more effective in ensuring that the Environmental Management&#13;
Plans approved by Center and State as part of the EIA clearance process would be morc&#13;
vigorously implemented.  The benefits accruing from  the establishment of Project&#13;
Management Cells in MOEF, DOD, and the Gujarat Department of Environment and Forest&#13;
essentially relate to the effectiveness of project implementation.&#13;

LEGAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
1.    The Constitution of India provides for the protection and improvement of the&#13;
environment. Article 51(g) of the Constitution states:&#13;
"It shall be the duty of every citizen of India to protect and improve the national environment, including forests,&#13;
lakes, rivers and wildlife and to have compassionfor living creatures. "&#13;
The language of the Directive Principles of State Policy (Article 47) also contains a specific&#13;
provision which commits the State to protect the environment.&#13;
2.    In addition to constitutional provisions, India has established a comprehensive set of&#13;
laws for the management and protection of the environment. These comprise a series of Acts,&#13;
Notifications, Rules and Amendments as shown in Box 4.&#13;
3.    While all of these laws are important to the legal framework of environmental&#13;
management in India, in recent years several of these Acts have become very important.&#13;
These are: the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1974 and Cess Act of 1977;&#13;
the Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1981; the Environment (Protection) Act&#13;
of 1986; the Hazardous Wastes Rules of 1989; the Forest (Conservation) Act, as amended in&#13;
1988; the Wildlife Act of 1972; the Policy Statement on Abatement of Pollution of 1992; and&#13;
the Environmental Audit, Clearance (Environment Impact Assessment), and Coastal&#13;
Regulation Zone Notifications of 1991, 1992, and 1994. The salient features of these Acts are&#13;
outlined below.&#13;
4.    The Environment (Protection) Act of 1986 was enacted in the wake of the Bhopal gas&#13;
tragedy under Article 253 of the Indian Constitution. The purpose of this Act is to implement&#13;
the decisions of the 1972 UN Conference on the Human Environment. This act is umbrella&#13;
legislation that provides a framework for central and state authorities established under&#13;
previous laws such as the Water Act (Paras. 5-7) and the Air Act (para. 8). It provides a single&#13;
focus for the protection of the environment and seeks to plug the loopholes of earlier&#13;
legislation relating to the environment. Several sets of rules relating to various aspects of the&#13;
management of hazardous chemicals, wastes, micro-organisms, and so on, have been written&#13;
under this act. Salient features of this act are:&#13;

the time limit or the standards; and&#13;
(e)   industries that require consent under the Water Act, Air Act or both, or&#13;
authorization under the Hazardous Waste (Management and Handling) Rules,&#13;
1989, are required to submit an environmental audit report to the concerned&#13;
State Pollution Control Board on or before September 30 every year.&#13;
5.    The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act, 1974. This Act provides for&#13;
the prevention and control of water pollution and maintaining or restoring good water quality&#13;
for any establishment. The act assigns functions and powers to the Central and State Pollution&#13;
Control Boards for prevention and control of water pollution and all related matters. On a&#13;
case-by-case basis, or where there may be a union territory involved, the act allows for the&#13;
constitution of a joint Board i.e., by two or more governments of contiguous states by the&#13;
central government. Subject to the provisions of the act, functions and powers of Central as&#13;
well as the State Boards have been delineated individually and with respect to each other. For&#13;
the prevention and control of water pollution, the state government has the power to restrict&#13;
the application of the act to certain areas, obtain information, take samples of effluents and&#13;
follow appropriate procedures thereafter, enter and inspect an establishment, prohibit use of&#13;
streams or wells for disposal of polluting material, restrict new outlets and discharges, restrict&#13;
existing discharge of sewage or trade effluent, and refuse or withdraw any consent by the state&#13;
board.&#13;
6.    The Central Pollution Control Board, as well as the State Pollution Control Boards are&#13;
eligible for contributions from the central government and state governments, respectively, to&#13;
enable them to perform the functions appropriately. The Act also prescribes stringent&#13;
penalties for those who operate their industry without valid consent or in violation of consent&#13;
conditions. The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Amendment Act, 1988 was&#13;
passed to overcome administrative and practical difficulties in implementing the provisions of&#13;
the original act.&#13;

7.    The Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Cess Act of 1977. This Act&#13;
provides for the levy and collection of a cess on water consumed by persons carrying on&#13;
certain industries and by local authorities, with a view to augmenting the resources of the&#13;
Central Pollution Control Board and the State Pollution Control Boards for the prevention and&#13;
control of water pollution constituted under the Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution)&#13;
Act, 1974.  It also covers specifications on affixing of meters, furnishing of returns,&#13;
assessment of cess, interest payable for delay in payment of cess, and penalty for nonpayment&#13;
of cess within the specified time. Salient features of this act are:&#13;
a)   the assessing authority under the act levies and collects a cess based on the&#13;
amount of water consumed and the purpose for which the water is used;&#13;
b)   the concerned industries are required to install standard water meters for&#13;
measuring and recording the quantity of water consumed;&#13;
c)    based on cess returns to be furnished by the industry every month, the amount&#13;
of cess is determined by the assessing authorities;&#13;
d)    aggrieved persons may appeal the assessment to the Appellate Authority; and&#13;
e)   the act also provides for a twenty-five percent rebate on the cess, payable to&#13;
those industries that consume water within the quantity prescribed for that&#13;
category of industries and also comply with prescribed effluent standards.&#13;
8.    The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act of 1981 was enacted to prevent,&#13;
control and reduce air pollution, including noise pollution, and to establish boards at the&#13;
States/Union Territories to achieve this. This act prohibits the construction or operation of&#13;
any industrial plant without the consent of the State Pollution Control Board (SPCB). The act&#13;
assigns powers and functions to the CPCB and SPCBs for prevention and control of air&#13;
pollution and all other related matters. The Act states that state boards for the prevention and&#13;
control of water pollution are to be the state boards for the prevention and control of air&#13;
pollution. In addition, the CPCB can exercise the power and perform the functions of a state&#13;
board in the Union Territories. For the prevention and control of air pollution, the state&#13;
government in consultation with SPCB has the power to set standards for emissions from&#13;
automobiles, impose restrictions on use of certain industrial plants, and prohibit emissions of&#13;
air pollutants in excess of the standards laid down by the SPCB. It can also make an&#13;
application to court for restraining persons from causing air pollution. In addition, it also has&#13;
the power of entry and inspection, power to obtain information and power to take samples of&#13;
air emissions and conduct the appropriate follow-up. The CPCB, as well as the SPCBs are&#13;
eligible for contributions from the central government and state government, respectively, to&#13;
perform their functions appropriately. The act also allows for appropriate penalties and&#13;

procedures for noncompliance. The Air (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Amendment&#13;
Act of 1987 includes amendments to facilitate implementation of the 1981 act.&#13;
9.    The Manufacture, Storage and Import of Hazardous Chemicals Rules of 1989&#13;
were developed under authority conferred by the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The&#13;
principal objectives of the rules are the prevention of major accidents arising from industrial&#13;
activities, the mitigation of effects of such accidents on people and on the environment, and&#13;
the harmonization of various control measures and agencies to prevent and limit major&#13;
accidents. The rules specify three levels of requirements.&#13;
a)    general or low-level requirements apply to 434 chemicals and require the&#13;
industrial unit to take necessary precautions to prevent major accidents, to&#13;
report those that do arise and take steps to limit consequences, prepare a&#13;
Material Safety Data Sheet, report imports, and properly label the hazardous&#13;
chemicals handled;&#13;
b)   the medium-level control applies to 179 chemicals and requires that the unit in&#13;
control of the relevant activity provide workers on-site with infonnation,&#13;
training and necessary equipment to ensure their safety as well as an off-site&#13;
emergency plan;&#13;
c)   the high-level controls apply to 17 chemicals in quantities that are unsafe.&#13;
Users of these chemicals must prepare a Safety Report. New industries are&#13;
required to prepare the Safety Report within five years of beginning operation.&#13;
An on-site emergency plan for dealing with major accidents is also required;&#13;
and&#13;
d)    both medium and high-level controls require public disclosure. Information&#13;
regarding a potential off-site spill or an on-site accident must be provided to&#13;
the District Collector for the preparation of an off-site emergency plan before&#13;
commencement of the activity. Also, the public in the vicinity of the plant&#13;
needs to be informed of the nature of a major accident that might occur on-site&#13;
and what to do in case of such an occurrence.&#13;
10.   The Hazardous Wastes (Management and Handling) Rules of 1989 require&#13;
industries to classify wastes into categories. Other provisions include:&#13;
(a)   the occupier generating hazardous wastes must take all practical steps to ensure&#13;
that such wastes are properly handled and disposed of;&#13;
(b)   hazardous wastes must be collected, treated, stored and disposed of only in&#13;
facilities authorized for this purpose by the State Pollution Control Boards;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(c)   before hazardous wastes are delivered, the facility occupier or operator must&#13;
ensure that the hazardous wastes are packaged in a manner suitable for storage&#13;
and transport;&#13;
(d)   the state govermnent, or a person authorized by it, must undertake an ongoing&#13;
program to identify disposal sites and compile and publish periodically an&#13;
inventory of disposal sites within the state;&#13;
(e)   the occupier generating hazardous waste and the operator of a facility for&#13;
collection, reception, treatment, transport, storage and disposal of hazardous&#13;
waste must maintain records of such operations;&#13;
(f)   when an accident occurs during transport of hazardous wastes, the facility&#13;
occupier or operator must report the incident immediately to the State Pollution&#13;
Control Board; and&#13;
(g)   import of hazardous wastes from any country to India for dumping and&#13;
disposal is prohibited. However, import of such wastes may be allowed for&#13;
processing or reuse as raw material.&#13;
11.   The Manufacture, Use, Import, Export and Storage of Hazardous Micro-&#13;
Organisms and Genetically Engineered Organisms of Cells Rules, 1989. The central&#13;
government established these rules with a view to protecting the environment, nature and&#13;
health, in connection with the application of gene technology and micro-organisms. These&#13;
rules are applicable to the manufacture, import and storage of micro-organisms and&#13;
genetically engineered organisms. However, such licenses are issued only after the proposal&#13;
is cleared from the environmental angle by the Ministry of Environment and Forests. For&#13;
according such clearances, the Ministry has notified the "Rules for the Manufacture, Use,&#13;
Import, Export and Storage of Hazardous Micro-organisms and Genetically Engineered&#13;
Organisms or Cells" in 1989 under the EPA of 1986. The investor is required to submit an&#13;
application to the Ministry of Environment and Forests. The Genetic Engineering Approval&#13;
Committee (GEAC) constituted by the Ministry of Environment and Forests examines the&#13;
application form and makes recommendations. All industries involving hazardous micro-&#13;
organisms or genetically engineered organisms are required to constitute an Institutional Bio-&#13;
Safety Committee (IBSC) to oversee the planning of an on-site emergency plan to deal with&#13;
any accident which may occur due to hazardous micro-organisms.&#13;
12.   The Policy Statement for Abatement of Pollution of February 1992 affirms the&#13;
government's intention to integrate environmental and economic aspects in development&#13;
planning, with stress on the preventive aspects of pollution abatement, and promotion of&#13;
technological inputs to reduce industrial pollutants. the overall policy objective is to integrate&#13;
&#13;

environmental considerations into decision making at all levels. Specific steps identified to&#13;
meet this objective are: (a) prevent pollution at source; (b) encourage, develop and apply the&#13;
best available practicable solutions; (c) ensure that the polluter pays for the pollution control&#13;
arrangement; (d) focus protection on heavily polluted areas; (e) involve the public in decision&#13;
making; and (f) increase the safety of industrial operations. To achieve the objectives,&#13;
maximum use will be made of a mix of instruments in the form of legislation and regulation,&#13;
fiscal incentives, voluntary agreements, educational programs and information campaigns.&#13;
The emphasis will be on increased use of regulations and an increase in the development and&#13;
application of financial incentives.&#13;
13.   Fiscal Incentives to Encourage Control and Prevention of Pollution.  The&#13;
Government of India offers several incentives to ensure that industries are motivated to&#13;
comply with the various environmental standards prescribed under different acts and rules to&#13;
control and prevent pollution. Some major fiscal incentives are as follows:&#13;
(a)   exemption from income tax. In order to ensure enthusiastic public involvement,&#13;
particularly of the corporate sector and private individuals, donations given by&#13;
a taxpayer to any association or institution for programs on conservation of&#13;
nature and natural resources are exempt from income tax. The Secretary of the&#13;
Ministry of Environment and Forests approves such institutions and&#13;
associations.&#13;
(b)   depreciation allowance. A depreciation allowance of 30 percent is allowed on&#13;
devices and systems installed by industrial units for minimizing pollution or for&#13;
conservation of natural resources.&#13;
(c)   investment allowance. An investment allowance at the rate of 35 percent of the&#13;
actual costs of new machinery or plant to assist in the control of pollution and&#13;
protection of the environment is granted. The central government has notified&#13;
a list of machinery and plant on which investment allowance is granted.&#13;
(d)   exemption from tax on capital gains. The purpose of this incentive is to&#13;
encourage industries to shift from congested urban areas. Capital gains arising&#13;
from transfer of buildings or lands used for business purposes are exempt from&#13;
tax if these are used for acquiring or for constructing buildings for the purpose&#13;
of business at a new place.&#13;
(e)   excise and duty exemption on utilization of fly-ash, phosphogypsum, and so on.&#13;
excise duty is exempted on the production of low-cost building materials and&#13;
components;&#13;

14.   The Public Liability Insurance Act of 1991 provides immediate relief to persons&#13;
affected by accidents while handling hazardous substances. The act requires that:&#13;
(a)   where death or injury to any person (other than a workman) or damage to any&#13;
property has resulted from an accident, the owner is liable to give relief on a&#13;
"no fault basis";&#13;
(b)   every owner must take out, before he starts handling hazardous substances, one&#13;
or more liability insurance policies equal to its paid up capital or&#13;
Rs. 500 million, whichever is less. The policy has to be renewed every year.&#13;
New undertakings must apply for liability insurance before starting their&#13;
activity;&#13;
(c)   accidents are verified by the District Collector, who may hold an inquiry into&#13;
the claim(s) and may make an award determining the amount of relief;&#13;
(d)   the central government will set up an Environmental Relief Fund to be utilized&#13;
for paying, in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The owner also has to&#13;
pay an amount equal to its annual premium to the central government's&#13;
Environment Relief Fund. The reimbursement of relief to the extent of&#13;
Rs. 25,000 per person is allowed in case of fatal accidents in addition to the&#13;
reimbursement of medical expenses up to Rs. 12,500. The liability of the&#13;
insurer is limited to Rs. 50 million per accident up to Rs. 150 million per year&#13;
or up to the tenure of the policy. Any excess claims will be paid from the&#13;
environment relief fund or by the owner;&#13;
(e)   Owners must provide the final compensation, if any, arising out of legal&#13;
proceedings. The Public Liability Insurance Amendment Act specifies the&#13;
responsibilities of different participants under the liability law.&#13;

15.   The Environmental Audit Notification of 1992 applies to every person carrying on&#13;
an industry, operation or process requiring consent to operate under the Water Act, Air Act, or&#13;
both, or authorization under the Hazardous Wastes (Management and Handling Rules), 1989,&#13;
issued under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986. The notification requires that an&#13;
environmental statement for the financial year ending March 31st be submitted to the&#13;
concerned State Pollution Control Board on or before September 30 every year, beginning in&#13;
1993. The realization that industry and environment should go hand in hand so as to achieve&#13;
sustainable development was brought in realization to consider environmental protection a&#13;
bare necessity. "Environmental Audit" is a technique being introduced for integrating the&#13;
interests of industry and environment, so that these could be mutually supportive. The Policy&#13;
Statement for Abatement of Pollution by the Goverrunent of India, provides for submission of&#13;
environmental statement by all concerned industries, which would subsequently evolve into&#13;
an environmental audit. [Environmental Auditing is a management tool comprising a&#13;
systematic, documented, periodic and objective evaluation of how well the management&#13;
systems are performing with the aim of:  waste prevention and reduction, assessing&#13;
compliance with regulatory requirements, facilitating control of environmental practices by a&#13;
company's management and placing environmental information in the public domain].&#13;
16.   The Environmental Impact Assessment of Development Projects Notification of&#13;
1994.  Until January 1994, obtaining environmental clearance from the Ministry of&#13;
Environment and forests was only an administrative requirement intended for mega projects&#13;
undertaken by the government or public sector undertakings. The EIA Notification issued in&#13;
January 1994 and amended in May, 1994, makes Environment Impact Assessment (EIA)&#13;
statutory for 29 different identified activities (Schedule - 1) which can be broadly categorized&#13;
under the following sectors:  industries; mining; thermal power plants; river valley&#13;
development; ports; harbors and airports; communication; atomic energy; transport (rail, road,&#13;
highway); and tourism ( including hotels and beach resorts in the Coastal Regulation Zone).&#13;
17.   All projects listed under Schedule - 1 are required to obtain environmental clearance&#13;
from the central government i.e. the Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF). Projects&#13;
which fall under the delicensed category of the New Industrial Policy are also required to&#13;
obtain environmental clearance from the MOEF.&#13;
18.   All development projects whether under Schedule - I or not, if they are to be in certain&#13;
notified ecologically sensitive or fragile areas such as the Doon Valley; Dahanu Taluka;&#13;
Aravalli ranges in Gurgaon district of Haryana; Alwar district in Rajasthan etc., will also have&#13;
to obtain environmental clearance from the MOEF.&#13;
&#13;

19.  Industrial projects where the investment is Rs. 500 million or above must receive&#13;
MOEF clearance. Industrial activities where the investment is Rs. 10 million and above in&#13;
pesticides; bulk drugs and pharmaceuticals, asbestos and asbestos products; paints; distilleries;&#13;
raw skins and hides; dyes; foundries and electroplating will also require the clearance of the&#13;
Ministry of Environment and Forests. Industrial projects are further required to obtain a&#13;
Letter of Intent (LOI) from the Ministry of Industry, and a No Objection Certificate (NOC)&#13;
from the State Pollution Control Board and state Forest Department if the location involves&#13;
forest land. Once the NOC is obtained, the LOI is converted to an Industrial License by the&#13;
state authorities. However, if the project falls under Schedule - 1 of the EIA Notification, it&#13;
must obtain an environmental clearance from the MOEF. Obtaining the necessary approvals&#13;
from the MOEF is facilitated by following a set of "Siting Guidelines" which are issued by the&#13;
MOEF.&#13;
20.   Only mining projects involving more than 5 hectares of land are required to obtain"&#13;
Site Clearance" from the MOEF. Other projects involving leases of less than 5 hectares of&#13;
land are cleared by state governments.&#13;
21.   The EIA Notification requires each project to submit a number of documents to the&#13;
MOEF in order to obtain enviromnental clearance as follows:&#13;
(a)   Feasibility/Project Report;&#13;
(b)   site clearance ( only for site-specific projects mentioned in the Notification);&#13;
(c)   No Objection Certificate from the SPCB and other state authorities;&#13;
(d)   Completed Environment Appraisal questionnaire:&#13;
(e)   Environment Impact Assessment Report and Environment Management Plan;&#13;
(f)    Risk Analysis, Emergency Preparedness Plan ( only in the case of projects&#13;
involving hazardous substances); and&#13;
(g)   rehabilitation plans where large scale displacement of people is anticipated.&#13;
22.   The EIA Notification also outlined an environmental appraisal procedure as follows:&#13;
(a)   the documents listed above are reviewed first by the multi-disciplinary staff in&#13;
the MOEF. They may also visit the project site, and consult with experts as&#13;
necessary;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

PAGE 11 OF 13&#13;
(b)   after the initial review, the proposals are placed before specially constituted&#13;
committees of experts known as Environmental Appraisal Committees for each&#13;
sector. Besides the review of documents, the Committee may also undertake&#13;
site visits, and directly interact with affected people and environment groups;&#13;
(c)   in the case of very special or controversial projects which arouse considerable&#13;
public interest, the Committee will arrange public hearings to ensure public&#13;
participation. announcements for public hearings are made at least 30 days&#13;
before through newspapers.&#13;
(d)   after the above steps are completed, the Appraisal Committee makes a&#13;
recommendation for approval or rejection to the MOEF. The Minister of&#13;
Environment and Forests makes the final decision to approve or reject based on&#13;
recommendation placed before him by the staff of MOEF.&#13;
23.   Whenever a project is given environmental clearance, a set of recommendations and&#13;
conditions are stipulated by the Appraisal Committee which have to be complied with by the&#13;
investor once the project is commissioned.  Project authorities are required to submit&#13;
semiannual compliance reports to the MOEF to enable the Ministry to monitor the&#13;
implementation of the recommendations and conditions of environmental clearance. The six&#13;
Regional Offices of the MOEF (Shillong, Bhubaneswar, Chandigarh, Bangalore, Lucknow&#13;
and Bhopal) assist the MOEF in monitoring environmnental cleared projects. Cases of non-&#13;
compliance of recommendations and conditions of environmental clearance are brought to the&#13;
notice of the concerned State Pollution Control Board for action.&#13;
24.   Forest (Conservation) Act of 1980 and 1988 Amendments provide for the&#13;
conservation of forests and matters related to the same. It calls for restrictions on the&#13;
dereservation of forests or use of forest land for non-forest purposes, i.e. the clearing of any&#13;
forest land for the cultivation of tea, coffee, spices, rubber, palms, oil-bearing plants,&#13;
horticultural crops or medicinal plants, or any purpose other than reforestation. It also&#13;
provides for the constitution of advisory committees and outlines the jurisdictions of&#13;
government departments and provides the central government with power to make rules for&#13;
carrying out the provisions of the act.&#13;
25.   National Forest Policy of 1988 focused on a new strategy of forest conservation&#13;
which included preservation, maintenance, sustainable utilization, restoration and&#13;
enhancement of the natural environment. The following are the objectives governing the forest&#13;
policy:&#13;

(a)    maintenance of environmental stability through preservation and, where&#13;
necessary, restoration of the ecological balance that has been adversely&#13;
distributed by serious depletion of the forests of the country.&#13;
(b)    conserving the natural heritage of the country by preserving the remaining&#13;
natural forests with the vast variety of flora and fauna, which represent the&#13;
remarkable biological diversity and genetic resources of the country;&#13;
(c)    checking soil erosion and denudation in the catchment areas of rivers, lakes,&#13;
and reservoirs in the interest of soil and water conservation, for mitigating&#13;
floods and droughts, and for the retardation of siltation of reservoirs;&#13;
(d)   checking the extension of sand dunes in the desert areas of Rajasthan and along&#13;
the coastal tracts;&#13;
(e)   increasing substantially the forest tree cover in the country through massive&#13;
afforestation and social forestry programs, especially on all denuded, degraded&#13;
and unproductive lands;&#13;
(f)    meeting the requirements of fuelwood, fodder and minor forest produce and&#13;
small timber of the rural and tribal populations;&#13;
(g)   increasing the productivity of forests to meet essential national needs;&#13;
(h)   encouraging efficient utilization of forest produce by maximizing substitution&#13;
of wood; and&#13;
(i)    creating a massive people's movement with the involvement of women, for&#13;
achieving these objectives and to minimize pressure on existing forests.&#13;
In addition, the policy outlines the essentials of forest management, strategies of afforestation,&#13;
social forestry and farm forestry, wildlife conservation, forest-based industries, and forest&#13;
education and research.&#13;
26.   Wildlife (Protection) Act of 1972 is a unified national act superseding previous&#13;
specific state laws and the Indian Forest Act, 1927, which enables the constitution and&#13;
management of areas as national parks, sanctuaries, game reserves, and closed areas. It also&#13;
specifies the procedures for establishing protected areas, the management parameters for&#13;
them, and the procedures for allowing or disallowing diverse uses within them. Under this&#13;
act, national parks are given a higher level of importance than sanctuaries, since no grazing or&#13;
private land holding or right is permitted within them. The act also provides for identification&#13;
of sanctuaries for certain human uses. It specifies for hunting of wild animals with respect to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

license needed, maintenance of records of wild animals killed, restrictions of hunting, etc. It&#13;
provides for the declaration of any area to be a sanctuary, national park or game reserve by the&#13;
state government, if it is considered that the area is of adequate ecological, fauna, floral,&#13;
geomorphological, natural or zoological significance for the purpose of protecting,&#13;
propagating wildlife or its environment. In addition, the act also prohibits the trade of wild&#13;
animals or animal articles and trophies derived from certain animals.&#13;
27.   Coastal Regulation Zone Notification of 1991 was issued by the Ministry of&#13;
Environment and Forests under Section 3(1) and Section 3(2)(v) of the Environment&#13;
(Protection) Act of 1986. Under this notification, the central government declared the coastal&#13;
stretches of seas, bays, estuaries, creeks, rivers and backwaters which are influenced by tidal&#13;
action (on the landward side) up to 500 meters of the High Tide Line (HTL) and the land&#13;
between the Low Tide Line (LTL) and the HTL as Coastal Regulation Zone, and imposed&#13;
restrictions on the setting up and expansion of industries, operations and processes, etc. in the&#13;
Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ). The notification also prohibited within the CRZ the disposal&#13;
of hazardous substances, waste and effluent, untreated wastes and effluent from industries,&#13;
cities, towns and other human settlements, dumping of ash or other wastes from thermal plants&#13;
and construction activities in ecologically sensitive areas.&#13;
(a)   the CRZ notification listed activities which were permissible in the CRZ, but&#13;
which require environmental clearance from the Ministry of Environment&#13;
Forests. There are: construction of defense facilities with foreshore facilities;&#13;
ports and harbors, jetties and wharves; thermal power plants, and other&#13;
activities with investment exceeding Rs. 50 million. Each state with a&#13;
coastline is also required to prepare a Coastal Zone Management Plan&#13;
identifying and classifying the CRZ areas in accordance with guidelines&#13;
included in the notification.&#13;
(b)   the notification classified coastal stretches into four categories depending on&#13;
the sensitivity of the location. Development activities are to be regulated&#13;
accordingly.&#13;
The notification also includes guidelines for the development of beach resorts/hotels in&#13;
CRZ III and restricts construction within 20 meters from the HTL and within the area between&#13;
the HTL and LTL.&#13;

ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT INSTITUTIONS&#13;
1.     The effective implementation of the wide range of environmental laws require&#13;
processes, procedures, and institutions at the center, state and district levels with the capacity&#13;
to plan, implement, monitor and enforce compliance. Although the current management&#13;
system is primarily a government-centered command and control regime, it does employ&#13;
incentives and other techniques to encourage voluntary compliance with pollution control,&#13;
forest protection, and the environment protection thrusts in the law. The environmental&#13;
management system also provides for the active participation of large numbers of community-&#13;
based, non-governmental, and private voluntary organizations which are active in&#13;
implementing small-scale environmental improvement and mitigation programs and give&#13;
voice to the "public interest" which is embodied in environmental legislation. Figure 2 shows&#13;
the organizational structure of India's environmental management system.&#13;

2.    The Environment is a central subject in India and follows from  the central&#13;
government's obligations agreed at the 1972 U.N. Conference on the Human Environment&#13;
(Attachment 1. Para. 4). The entire environment management system evolved with the&#13;
Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) in the Government of India in 1985. Many&#13;
states already had State Pollution Control Boards (SPCBs) located in Departments of Public&#13;
Health to perform functions outlined in the Water and Air Acts. In most states, the&#13;
Departments of Environment were also established only after 1985. The State Pollution&#13;
Control Boards are larger institutions by virtue of their traditional roles. Departments of&#13;
Environment in the states mostly function as small entities, generally devoid of the skills&#13;
which are required for policy planning and implementation. While the MOEF at the Center&#13;
has expanded and changed its skill-mix, the State Departments of Environment continue to&#13;
perform routine budgetary functions for the State Pollution Control Boards. Only the West&#13;
Bengal Department of the Environment has prepared an Environmental Action Program. The&#13;
plethora of environmental legislation at the national level needs to be matched by institutional&#13;
abilities at the state level where most of the monitoring and compliance activities are initiated.&#13;
3.    The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) is the nodal agency for&#13;
environmental management at the Center. It has a number of attached agencies and&#13;
institutions including the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) which is located in New&#13;
Delhi and six Regional Offices in various States. At the State level, the Departments of&#13;
Environment, Forests, and the State Pollution Control Boards are the key institutions. The&#13;
organization chart of the MOEF is shown in Figure 3. The major functions of the key&#13;
environmental management institutions are outlined in the following paragraphs.&#13;
4.    The Ministry of Environment and Forests (MOEF) The major functions of the&#13;
MOEF are to: (a) develop and implement conservation and protection strategies, including the&#13;
establishment of biosphere reserves, pollution monitoring, environmental appraisal of&#13;
development projects, and the protection of historical monuments of national importance;&#13;
(b) coordinate environmental management programs with other ministries and agencies,&#13;
volunteer organizations, professional bodies, and other groups; (c) develop national&#13;
environmental policy planning strategies; (d) work with global agencies on environmental&#13;
issues; (e) support research on environmental problems; (f) develop environmental education&#13;
programs to increase national awareness of environmental protection issues and the&#13;
importance of natural resource preservation and citizen participation; (g) review legislation&#13;
and formulate additional legal measures when needed&#13;

11.   Municipalities and Panchayats are expected to play an increasing role in&#13;
environmental management at the district level. Under the Constitution (Seventy-Third&#13;
Amendment and Seventy-Fourth Amendment) Act of 1992, State governments can delegate&#13;
certain functions to municipalities and Panchayats. Under the Eleventh Schedule of the&#13;
Seventy-Third Amendment, Panchayats would be responsible for, among other activities, land&#13;
improvement, land consolidation, soil conservation, water management and watershed&#13;
development, social and farm forestry, and non-conventional energy sources. Under the&#13;
Twelfth Schedule of the Seventy-Fourth Amendment, municipalities would be responsible for&#13;
urban and town planning, water supply for domestic, industrial and commercial use, solid&#13;
waste management and sanitation, urban forestry, protection of the environment and&#13;
promotion of ecological aspects of urban development.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The goal of the Environmental Management
            Capacity Building Technical Assistance Project is to assist
            the Government of India to implement its environmental
            priorities as outlined in the Environmental Action Program
            (EAP).  The specific objective of the project is to enhance
            environmental management capacity to ensure effective
            implementation of EAP priorities.  The Project includes six
            components: a) environmental policy planning; b)
            environmental administration; c) decentralization of
            environmental management; d) environmental law
            implementation; e) monitoring and compliance in high
            priority environmental problem areas; and f) Gujarat- where
            the project will strengthen the Department of Forests and
            Environment and the Gujarat Ecology Commission, as well as
            prepare a State Environmental Action Program.
