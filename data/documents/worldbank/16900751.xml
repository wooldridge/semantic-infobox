 and decades of small-scale projects focused on household                          launched the Sanitation Marketing Pilot Project. This Field&#13;

to last long. There seemed to be no options available that                        11 districts in both provinces. While project activities&#13;
could fill the gap between the preferred â&#128;&#152;idealâ&#128;&#153; latrine and                      were broadly the same in both provinces, there were&#13;
the cheapest possible designs.                                                    significant differences in existing conditions in the two&#13;

The private sector already provided the vast majority of                          higher population and population density, higher baseline&#13;
latrines installed in Cambodia, over 80% of all latrines                          sanitation coverage and wealthier, less agriculture-&#13;
installed in the country. However, the network of private                         dependent households compared to the poorer and more&#13;
sector enterprises involved in sanitation was highly                              rural Svay Rieng province. Among latrine owners, Kandal&#13;
fragmented. Latrines comprised only a small percentage of                         households tended to own the â&#128;&#152;idealâ&#128;&#153; pour-flush latrine&#13;
any enterpriseâ&#128;&#153;s total activity. Private enterprises had a very                   type, while in Svay Rieng there was a mix of pour-flush and&#13;
passive sales approach and were not involved in promotional                       dry pit latrines, and a greater variety of lower-cost shelter&#13;
activities. Households did not have access to information                         types. However, in both provinces, a large proportion of&#13;

of construction materials from different shops, which were&#13;
brought together and assembled into a latrine by a hired&#13;
mason and/or the household itself. Masons often provided&#13;
poor quality construction and were not a particularly&#13;
trusted source of information on sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
While numerous, the market constraints were clearly not&#13;
insurmountable. A number of promising opportunities&#13;
were identified that could help consumers better access the&#13;
products they wanted and help the sanitation market to&#13;
reach its full potential (Box 1).&#13;

&#13;
THE SANITATION MARKET&#13;
FACILITATION PROCESS&#13;
Drawing on findings from the assessments, a small number&#13;
of pilot programs began developing sanitation marketing&#13;
strategies to overcome market barriers. Launched in&#13;
January 2009, the Sanitation Marketing Pilot Project was&#13;
one such initiative. The project was implemented by the&#13;
NGO International Development Enterprises (iDE), with&#13;
technical and financial support from WSP and USAIDâ&#128;&#152;s&#13;
Cambodia Micro Small and Medium Enterprise Project.&#13;
It aimed to improve the sanitation market in two pilot&#13;

The process of market facilitation involved a number of                           â&#128;&#147; a pour-flush latrine â&#128;&#147; and simplified the purchase and&#13;
iterative steps and a flexible learning style that allowed key                    construction process by offering a ready-to-install latrine&#13;
strategies and activities to evolve over time in response to                      package. The product could be purchased from a single&#13;
new market information (Figure 1). This iterative learning                        enterprise and installed by consumers themselves, without&#13;
led to a number of strategic changes that gradually shifted                       the need to hire a mason. Product refinements, new&#13;
the approach from an NGO-led project intervention in the                          equipment and new production techniques enabled a shift&#13;
early phases to a more hands-off market facilitation role.                        to a â&#128;&#152;high volume, low marginâ&#128;&#153; business model. With more&#13;

test and refine latrine options. The design challenge was                                     easy to build&#13;
to make the product package more affordable, attractive&#13;
and accessible to consumers, working with commercially&#13;
available materials and existing enterprises.                                        One-page sheet&#13;

The original design brief was to develop a US$10 latrine, as                         help simplify the&#13;
willingness-to-pay data indicated 73% of rural households                            construction process.&#13;
without a latrine would be willing to pay this price.2&#13;
However, the research indicated a very strong consumer&#13;
preference for â&#128;&#152;permanentâ&#128;&#153; pour-flush options, which could&#13;
not feasibly be produced and sold by local enterprises for this&#13;
price. Assessing the trade-offs between product affordability&#13;
and desirability, the design focuses on a lower cost pour-&#13;
flush latrine that would give people the permanence and&#13;
durability they desired, even though this would result in a&#13;
more expensive product.&#13;
&#13;
The final product design, the Easy Latrine, was an offset&#13;
pour-flush latrine package consisting of a concrete slab&#13;
with integrated pour-flush ceramic pan, a pre-cast concrete&#13;

  BOX 2. DEFINITION OF PROJECT PARTNER ENTERPRISE AND SELF-STARTER ENTERPRISE&#13;
&#13;
  Project Partner Enterprise: An enterprise directly engaged by the project. Project Partner enterprises received&#13;
  intensive training and support from the project on production, promotion, and sale of the branded Easy Latrine.&#13;
  Project partners invested in new equipment to produce the catchment box and thinner concrete rings.&#13;
&#13;
  Self-Starter Enterprise: An enterprise that purchased or learned how to make a catchment box mold on its own,&#13;
  prior to engagement with NGO project staff. Self-starters often replicated the sales and delivery model of project&#13;
  partners on their own. Once identified by NGO staff, self-starters were offered short training, but did not receive&#13;
  the same comprehensive support that the project partners received. They offer a similar latrine package at a similar&#13;
  price but typically do not adopt the thinner rings and application of rice husk.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
From â&#128;&#152;Proof of Conceptâ&#128;&#153; to Replication                                            Soon other enterprises began to emerge as self-starters in Svay&#13;
At first, market facilitation activities focused on convincing                    Rieng (see Box 2 for the definition of project partner and self-&#13;
enterprises that selling latrines was an investment-worthy                        starter enterprise). This was the first evidence of entrepreneurs&#13;
business opportunity. Although a total of 50 concrete                             entering the sanitation market on their own, without&#13;
producers (36 in Kandal and 14 in Svay Rieng) were initially                      recruitment by NGO project staff. These entrepreneurs&#13;
identified in the target districts, the project had difficulty                    purchased or learned how to make a mold for the new&#13;
engaging these enterprises. Barriers to market entry included                     â&#128;&#152;catchment boxâ&#128;&#153; latrine component. They replicated the home&#13;
the requirement to invest in new equipment and spend time                         delivery and direct sales model to compete with project partner&#13;
learning new production techniques. Most enterprises were                         enterprises. Project staff offered shorter training, advice and&#13;
simply uninterested in making such investments to ramp                            encouragement to the self-starters, but did not provide the&#13;
up production of a slow-moving product like latrines and                          same level of support that the project partners received (Box&#13;
did not have much upfront belief in the â&#128;&#156;high volume-low                          3). From the outset, the self-starters were highly motivated&#13;
marginâ&#128;? business model.                                                           and less dependent on NGO support.&#13;
&#13;
In the early Proof of Concept stage, the project began&#13;
with only two enterprises, one in each province. The&#13;
project provided loans and investment guarantees, a&#13;
considerable amount of mentoring and training, and&#13;
substantial marketing support, in return for an enterpriseâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
commitment and investment in new equipment (about&#13;
US$440) and stock (about US$750 for a stock of 30&#13;
latrines).&#13;
&#13;
Over time, market facilitation activities transitioned to&#13;
an Expand and Replicate stage. Exposure tours and site&#13;
visits allowed potential enterprises to see for themselves&#13;
the success of early project partners. Radio programs and&#13;
Business Forums organized in coordination with local&#13;
government advertised the business opportunity to engage&#13;
new enterprises into the program, and as a result more&#13;
enterprises were engaged.&#13;

 Nine months into implementation, project partner                                  began to overlap geographically, the project started actively&#13;
 enterprises started to expand geographically to reach                             promoting competition. By the end of the pilot period,&#13;
 new consumers, since it was easy to achieve new sales in                          there were 16 project partner enterprises and eight self-&#13;
 previously untouched villages. As enterprises sales areas                         starters selling the new product package.&#13;

&#13;
  BOX 4. CLTS WITHIN THE SANITATION MARKETING PILOT PROJECT&#13;
&#13;
  Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) is a methodology for mobilizing communities to eliminate open defeca-&#13;
  tion. Communities are facilitated to conduct their own appraisal and analysis of open defecation and take their&#13;
  own action to become open defecation free (ODF). CLTS focuses on community-wide behavior change to create&#13;
  â&#128;&#152;ODFâ&#128;&#153; communities. The CLTS approach was introduced in Cambodia in 2005, and is currently a key element of&#13;
  the MRDâ&#128;&#153;s strategic approach to improving rural sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
  The Sanitation Marketing Pilot Project adopted several tools of the CLTS process in its village-level promotional&#13;
  events. The distinct differences from CLTS approach are as follows:&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 CLTS-type messages and steps (e.g. the use of disgust, the calculation of feces) were used primarily as tactics&#13;
     to motivate individual household latrine ownership and drive sale of the Easy Latrine.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 The use of CLTS-inspired sales tactics were mostly undertaken simultaneously (e.g. at a single village event).&#13;
     The project did not attempt to â&#128;&#152;sequenceâ&#128;&#153; CLTS triggering and promotional sales events.&#13;
&#13;
  Although there was some limited CLTS work underway in the pilot provinces, the project did not make any formal pro-&#13;
  grammatic links with these CLTS efforts. Other sanitation marketing programs in Cambodia have experimented with&#13;
  more explicit sequencing between CLTS and sanitation marketing and more learning is needed to understand how the&#13;
  two approaches can complement each other, and the appropriate implementation strategies for cost-effective synergy.&#13;

  meetings as the main activity, blending modified steps                            by project partner enterprises, and received a commission&#13;
  from CLTS triggering with active Easy Latrine sales and                           of around US$1.25 â&#128;&#147; 1.75 per latrine sale. Eighty-&#13;

  events were facilitated by full-time NGO project staff, who                       provincial officials. By September 2010, mid-way through&#13;
  planned and conducted the village meetings, took sales                            pilot implementation, NGO staff was no longer engaged in&#13;
  orders and coordinated directly with enterprises to arrange                       selling latrines directly to consumers.&#13;
  home delivery.&#13;
&#13;
  While successful, it was clear that NGO-led promotions&#13;
  would not be sustainable in the long term, since enterprises&#13;
  were reliant on NGO project staff not only for promotions,&#13;
  but also to help coordinate product sales orders and deliveries.&#13;
  To address these concerns, the project adopted a modified&#13;
  version of the commission-based latrine sales agent model,&#13;
  developed by the WaterSHED WASH Marketing Program.&#13;
  The project encouraged enterprises to establish a network of&#13;
  commissioned sales agents to conduct village promotional&#13;
  events, arrange orders, and coordinate payments and deliveries&#13;
  (Box 5).&#13;
&#13;
  Sales agents were trained in promotional tactics and by the&#13;
  end of the project, 164 sales agents were working across&#13;
  the two provinces. Sales agents were directly employed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     BOX 5. MOVING FROM A SOCIAL FRANCHISE MODEL TO â&#128;&#152;HANDS-OFFâ&#128;&#153; MARKET FACILITATION&#13;
&#13;
     The first phase of the program implementation for the Easy Latrine had some elements of a â&#128;&#152;social franchise.â&#128;&#153; Ini-&#13;
     tially, the NGO iDE acted as a kind of franchisor offering enterprises the opportunity to join a network of indepen-&#13;
     dent businesses. Network benefits included training, the use of the Easy Latrine brand, the new technical design&#13;
     and equipment, significant marketing and sales support and first-mover advantages through the small number of&#13;
     enterprises spaced over a wide geographic area. In return, enterprises were asked to invest in new equipment and&#13;
     stock, and guarantee a level of quality and commitment.&#13;
&#13;
     Although the original social franchise model was useful in the Proof of Concept phase, it appeared that other enter-&#13;
     prises could gain most of the advantages of the new business model and product without significant support from&#13;
     NGO staff. The emergence of self-starters and the fact that other enterprises are able to sell non-branded latrines&#13;
     at least as well as project partners imply that the franchise benefits as introduced in the pilot are relatively low.&#13;
&#13;
     Over time, the project adopted a more hands-off market facilitation approach, which was also used by the WASH&#13;
     marketing program of WaterSHED. With the hands-off approach, emphasis is on actively encouraging competition&#13;
     between existing enterprises, keeping barriers to market entry low and putting the responsibility for sales promo-&#13;
     tions with the enterprises. Self-starters that do not use the Easy Latrine brand are supported and encouraged. This&#13;
     approach would minimize the reliance on external support agencies such as NGOs.&#13;

  BOX 6. A MOTIVATED SELF-STARTER&#13;
&#13;
  Mr. Chhay Saron is an example of a self-starter entrepreneur who was motivated to enter the latrine business with&#13;
  very minimal support from the project. Mr. Saron first heard of latrine promotions in his native Romeas Heak dis-&#13;
  trict, Svay Rieng, at a commune workshop conducted by the project. As a pre-cast concrete producer, he knew&#13;
  some of his concrete rings were used for latrine pit linings, but he offered no other latrine components. Like most&#13;
  concrete producers, Mr. Saron waited in his shop for consumers to come to him. Customers had to source other&#13;
  latrine parts from hardware shops in the nearby market.&#13;
&#13;
  At the workshop, Mr. Saron heard Mr. Dourng Setha (the top-performing enterprise in the pilot project) talking&#13;
  about his thriving latrine selling enterprise. He went back to his shop and decided to offer a packaged product of&#13;
  his own. This included conventional concrete rings, bricks for the underground toilet chamber, transport and labor.&#13;
  In his first three months, Mr. Saron managed to sell five of these latrine packages. Then one day, project staff came&#13;
  to offer him technical advice. He learned about the pre-cast concrete chamber box and thinner ring technology.&#13;
  Mr. Saron purchased the new molds and equipment, investing about US$800. He received a one-day training, and&#13;
  also had a brief visit to a project partnerâ&#128;&#153;s enterprise. He quickly built up some stock. In the following month, he&#13;
  sold over 30 new latrine packages.&#13;
&#13;
  Since then, Mr. Saronâ&#128;&#153;s sales have been slow but steady. Mr. Saron has developed his own marketing materials. He&#13;
  manages his own promotions and does not rely on commissioned sales agents. He is confident the latrine-selling&#13;
  business line will grow, and that it will make a good complement to his core pig-raising enterprise. He has invested&#13;
  US$3,000 in a new truck to transport the latrine sets, and is already actively selling in three communes.&#13;

  Market Penetration and Sales Strategies                                                                  partner enterprises lost interest as latrine sales became more&#13;
                                                                                                           difficult, simply decreasing their latrine production to focus&#13;
  Reaching beyond the early adopters                                                                       on other more profitable opportunities. Others expanded&#13;
  Although Easy Latrine sales began strong, data indicate                                                  their markets geographically, happy to capture the first&#13;
  a general decline in recorded Easy Latrine sales over the                                                wave of initial sales in new villages.&#13;
  pilot period and some seasonal fluctuations for individual&#13;
  enterprises (Figure 6). However, the data also imply a strong                                            Rather than developing more effective sales and&#13;
  early sales push but a drop-off in intensity as demand slows                                             promotional strategies or complementary interventions&#13;
  down. Enterprises could make an average of about nine                                                    to help households pay for latrines, the project expanded&#13;
  sales per village to â&#128;&#152;early adopters,â&#128;&#153; that is, households that                                          its target area as enterprises were ready to expand their&#13;
  purchase a product or service before the majority of their                                               reach to previously untouched villages. Bearing in mind&#13;
  peers.                                                                                                   the relatively short timeframe of marketing activities, this&#13;
                                                                                                           pattern of â&#128;&#152;wide but shallowâ&#128;&#153; market penetration left most&#13;
  Given the very low sanitation coverage in rural Cambodia,                                                households in the target area without access to a latrine.&#13;
  there is a fairly large untapped market of early adopters&#13;
  willing to buy latrines if they are made more readily available                                          A key lesson from the pilot model is that focusing on&#13;
  at a lower cost. Capturing sales beyond the early adopters                                               the private sector alone may not be enough to achieve&#13;
  proved less attractive for enterprises. The costs of going back                                          high community coverage. It is clear that enterprises can&#13;
  to the same villages with the same product package and                                                   be expected to actively promote sanitation only to the&#13;
  promotional messages probably outweighed the benefits to                                                 extent that it is profitable (and more profitable than other&#13;
  enterprises in terms of new sales generated. Some project                                                activities) for them to do so. To improve on the pilot model,&#13;

  counted as â&#128;&#152;improvedâ&#128;&#153; sanitation facilities. Subsidized latrines are not included in estimates of coverage rate increase.&#13;
  **Baseline latrine counts in project villages were conducted at the start of implementation in each village, and thus occurred at different times covering a period of 16 months from Sep&#13;
  2009 to Dec 2010. End-line latrine count was conducted in February 2011.&#13;

Understanding Baseline Market Conditions&#13;
During the pilot project a uniform set of market development                                       evidence suggests that in more competitive environments&#13;
strategies was applied in the two pilot provinces. However,                                        with higher levels of baseline coverage, it may be possible&#13;
results indicate that a greater focus on understanding                                             to generate sales growth with less intensive support to&#13;
baseline enabling market conditions can help develop more                                          individual enterprises. In such areas, a stronger focus on&#13;
targeted marketing strategies. Sanitation coverage in Kandal                                       effective BCC and consumer demand creation coupled with&#13;
was more than double that of Svay Rieng at baseline, and                                           efforts to increase competition among a larger number of&#13;

Although increase in coverage was higher in Kandal,                                                for all enterprises (in terms of new sales) and consumers (in&#13;

     BOX 7. EASY LATRINE BRAND AWARENESS&#13;
&#13;
     The initial supply chain and marketing model included the development of the Easy Latrine product brand. Some&#13;
     testing of the brand took place, however, no professional branding or marketing advice was sought to develop&#13;
     and implement it. The main purpose of the brand was to make the product easier to be talked about and to help&#13;
     increase sales for project-supported enterprises as brand awareness increased. Although the Easy Latrine brand&#13;
     was used as an awareness raising tool, any increase in consumer demand â&#128;&#147; whether for the Easy Latrine or for&#13;
     other latrines â&#128;&#147; was considered a positive outcome.&#13;
&#13;
     Results from the end-line household survey indicate that product branding efforts varied by province. Over 70%&#13;
     of all households in Svay Rieng could recall Easy Latrine messages, and a large majority of those planning to pur-&#13;
     chase a latrine indicated that they intended to buy an Easy Latrine. By contrast, just 40% of Kandal households&#13;
     could recall any Easy Latrine messages, and most of those planning to purchase did not plan to buy an Easy&#13;
     Latrine.&#13;
&#13;
     Higher awareness of the Easy Latrine combined with the much lower density of enterprises likely contributed to&#13;
     the much higher market share of Easy Latrines in Svay Rieng compared to Kandal (73% vs. 27% of total pour-flush&#13;
     purchases). The difference in results could be associated with variability in the quality and extent of marketing&#13;
     across the two provinces. By the end of the pilot, as iDE and WSP considered how to sustainably scale up pilot&#13;
     work, the Easy Latrine product brand was dropped.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  In Svay Rieng, there is evidence that lower income household                      In general, the presence of the Easy Latrine product and&#13;
  consumers are adopting and using the product as a first step                      promotional efforts seemed to help motivate better-off&#13;
  towards the â&#128;&#152;idealâ&#128;&#153; latrine. Easy Latrine owners tended to                        households to purchase a latrine, even though the latrine&#13;
  construct their latrines themselves. About 40% used lower-                        they chose to purchase was often not an Easy Latrine.&#13;
  end materials such as thatch and plastic sheets. The median&#13;
  cost was US$46 for a complete Easy Latrine with shelter. In                       Promoting Latrine Usage, Stopping Open&#13;
  household survey interviews, households stated the number                         Defecation&#13;
  one reason for purchasing an Easy Latrine was because â&#128;&#152;it                         In the monitored villages, most households do not have a&#13;
  could be delivered to my house,â&#128;&#153; signaling that they are                          latrine and open defecation is still the norm. While reported&#13;
  responding to the easier purchase pathway enabled by the                          toilet usage is high (81 â&#128;&#147; 100%) among adult latrine owners,&#13;
  new home delivery distribution model.                                             up to 32% of children in latrine owning households are&#13;
                                                                                    not regularly using the toilet for defecation. These findings&#13;
  In Kandal, where household incomes are higher and access                          suggest the need for a more effective and broad-based&#13;
  to markets is greater, the majority of Easy Latrine owners in                     BCC campaign focused on stopping open defecation and&#13;
  Kandal constructed shelters of higher-end materials such as                       encouraging consistent usage and safe child feces disposal -&#13;
  concrete and bricks, and over half hired a mason to assist                        not just purchase and ownership - of a latrine. A lesson from&#13;
  with construction. The median cost for the Easy Latrine with                      the pilot is that more targeted support to address the local&#13;
  full shelter was US$102. Although this is substantially lower                     enabling environment can arguably open up opportunities&#13;
  than the US$164 typical â&#128;&#152;idealâ&#128;&#153; latrines purchased by other                       to build on and strengthen local government initiatives&#13;

  BOX 8. KEY SUCCESS FACTORS IN PILOT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Treating people as consumers, not beneficiaries: By approaching households as discerning consumer and&#13;
     not charity recipients, the sanitation marketing approach encouraged a change in mindset that allowed the&#13;
     project to think creatively, taking a fresh look at an existing problem and coming up with a novel set of solu-&#13;
     tions.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Market research and design thinking: Experience from the project highlights the importance of understand-&#13;
     ing consumers and the supply chain as a basis for designing market development strategies. The product&#13;
     package itself helped to stimulate changes on both the supply and the demand side, demonstrating the value&#13;
     of product development at the outset of sanitation marketing initiatives. The design process, with its focus on&#13;
     iterative learning, prototyping and refining solutions proved a useful tool for learning throughout the project.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Flexibility, adaptive management and the right skills: The project demonstrated the importance of viewing&#13;
     sanitation marketing as a process, not a blueprint. Markets do not fit into time- and area-bound project imple-&#13;
     mentation schedules. Markets grow naturally, enterprises cannot be confined geographically, and consumer&#13;
     and enterprise needs evolve over time. The project used regular, flexible feedback loops to closely monitor and&#13;
     revise strategies.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	 Collaboration and learning: Intensive collaboration between stakeholders working on sanitation marketing&#13;
     initiatives has helped create a community of practice in Cambodia. The project team was able to share lessons&#13;
     and also benefitted from mutual learning and adoption of successful approaches from other programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  BOX 9. FOSTERING CHANGE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL&#13;
&#13;
  The Cambodian Ministry of Rural Development has taken a strong leadership role in encouraging innovation and&#13;
  collaboration in the sanitation sector, helping to foster a dynamic community of practice in Cambodia. WSP, UNI-&#13;
  CEF and others helped MRD gain early experience with sanitation marketing, CLTS and other demand-driven ap-&#13;
  proaches through exposure to other countries, targeted training and high-level policy advocacy. This national-level&#13;
  support was critical to building interest and enthusiasm for approaches that strengthen demand and supply. MRD&#13;
  has led a national debate on household hardware subsidies, which is now reflected in the recently approved rural&#13;
  water supply and sanitation strategy. The growing body of evidence from a range of sanitation marketing pro-&#13;
  grams is also building sector consensus and government support for sanitation marketing. As a result, MRD has&#13;
  drafted a set of National Sanitation Marketing Guidelines for sub-national government, outlining potential market&#13;
  enabling roles at all levels. MRD has also formed a Rural Sanitation and Hygiene Sub-Working Group, with a spe-&#13;
  cific thematic focus on how to better coordinate and harmonize CLTS, sanitation marketing and behavior change&#13;
  approaches, and how to improve targeting and delivery of latrine subsidies.&#13;
&#13;
  Despite these promising activities, the sector is now at a critical point where MRD needs to consolidate the expe-&#13;
  riences and learning of CLTS and sanitation marketing into a more cohesive programmatic approach to improve&#13;
  rural sanitation at scale.&#13;

  in Kandal. Regardless of the type of latrine, the fact that                       numerous challenges on the horizon:&#13;
  such a large proportion of non-owners stated an intention&#13;
  to purchase is promising.                                                         â&#128;¢	 Optimizing and institutionalizing enterprise en-&#13;

  Understanding Affordability of Easy Latrine                                          the support to the enterprises needs to be strategic and&#13;
  Although the price of Easy Latrine was lower than that                               contextualized to fit their needs. The right package of&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Water and Sanitation Program
            (WSP)-supported Sanitation Marketing Pilot Project is one of
            a range of sanitation marketing initiatives applying the
            sanitation marketing approach to the rural Cambodian
            context. The project designed a new affordable pour-flush
            latrine package (the 'Easy Latrine'), trained
            local enterprises to profitably produce and sell it, and
            developed sales and promotional strategies to increase
            consumer demand. In less than two years, households from
            four provinces purchased a total of 10,621 unsubsidized Easy
            Latrines from local private enterprises. In 601 monitored
            villages, there was a 7.7 percentage point increase in
            improved sanitation coverage from a baseline of 24 percent,
            which is six times higher than the background rate of
            increase. Thus, a significant and rapid increase in durable
            latrine coverage could be achieved without the use of any
            hardware subsidies.
