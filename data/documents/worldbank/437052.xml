            The benefits of separating rail
            infrastructure from operations
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The author offers a number of reasons
            for separating rail infrastructure from operations: to
            reduce unit costs, to create intrarail competition, to
            better focus on the services to be provided, to clarify
            public policy, and to strike a better balance between the
            roles of the public and private sectors. Moreover, recent
            experience with "negative" concessions, in which
            the private sector provides public services (based on
            competition to provide the service and in return for
            compensation), is adding another dimension to the
            "public vs. private" debate. In this sense
            separating infrastructure allows new approaches to the
            problem of meeting public responsibilities. Concessioning
            programs in Argentina, Sweden, and the United Kingdom define
            the broad alternatives in rail infrastructure separation.
            The two main challenges for separation are capacity
            management and pricing policies. While it is true that
            infrastructure separation is messy and expensive, it will be
            a small price to pay if "fragmentation" offers a
            better fit for consumers.
