This report is one in a series of products of the Water and Sanitation Programâ&#128;&#153;s Scaling Up&#13;
Sanitation Project funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. A major focus of the&#13;
project is on learning how to scale up efforts in the sanitation sector in the developing world..&#13;
The project tests proven and promising approaches to create demand for sanitation and the use of&#13;
marketing techniques to generate demand and improve the supply of sanitation-related products&#13;
and services among the rural poor.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                          SUMMARY&#13;
The Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC), a national program for sanitation by the Government of India, has&#13;
been ongoing for more than three years. The TSC program is managed by the Rajiv Ghandi Mission for&#13;
Drinking Water of the Rural Development Department at the national level. At the state level, the&#13;
program is managed by the Rural Development Department in Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh,&#13;
although previously by the Public Health Engineering Department in Madhya Pradesh.&#13;
&#13;
The TSC program, which is aimed at eradicating open defecation in India by 2010, has four main&#13;
components: (1) Individual household latrines; (2) school sanitation and hygiene education; (3)&#13;
community sanitary complexes; and (4) anganwadi latrines. The program encourages cost-effective and&#13;
appropriate technologies, and recommends the conversion of dry pit latrines to pour flush. The TSC&#13;
guideline strongly recommends the use of a demand-driven approach that is people-centered and at the&#13;
same time offers a subsidy to assist poor households to build latrines. The subsidy has recently been&#13;
increased three-fold from Rs500 to Rs1,500. The program also has an award scheme (known as the&#13;
Nirmal Gram Pruskar) with financial incentives for villages that have achieved total sanitation coverage.&#13;
&#13;
Although the guideline recommends the use of demand-driven approaches, TSC in many states, including&#13;
Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, has become supply-driven. The increased awareness of the TSC&#13;
program amongst various state governments and the urge to win more Nirmal Gram Puskar (NGP)&#13;
awards had led to an increase and extension of latrine subsidies to every household. If the current trend&#13;
continues, the program will end up like previous sanitation programs, with many latrines abandoned soon&#13;
after receiving an NGP award.&#13;
&#13;

Global Scaling Up Sanitation Project&#13;
&amp;#12;In comparison, Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS) is an approach that involves the community in&#13;
analyzing its sanitation situation and encourages members to develop solutions for eradicating open&#13;
defecation. CLTS focuses on communal rather than on individual household actions.&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation marketing is the use of commercial marketing principles to create demand and uptake of&#13;
improved sanitation. It uses market research methods to try to understand the motivations and barriers&#13;
for individuals to acquire or not acquire improved sanitation facilities. This information is used to develop&#13;
concepts and materials for promotion. It also identifies attributes that consumers want or need in a toilet,&#13;
which is then used to enhance supply mechanisms by providing various toilet options, improving access&#13;
to builders and materials suppliers.&#13;
&#13;
The Global Scaling Up Sanitation Project is the fusion of CLTS and sanitation marketing. The project is&#13;
applying a total sanitation and sanitation marketing approach (TSSM). In TSSM, sanitation marketing&#13;
complements CLTS to assess and create demand and to improve supply mechanisms. It develops&#13;
approaches to create demand for sanitation and to improve the supply of sanitation-related products and&#13;
services in order to increase household access to safe and sustainable sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
This report documents findings from the situation assessment of the supply market for rural sanitation in&#13;
Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh within the context of current state-level sanitation programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Findings from Himachal Pradesh&#13;
â&#128;¢ CLTS has been ongoing in some districts in Himachal Pradesh but not in others. In districts where&#13;
  CLTS is being implemented, such as Solan District, evidence shows that it is a sustainable approach&#13;
  for eradicating open defecation.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ At the state level, responsibility for the TSC program lies with the Joint Secretary of the Rural&#13;
  Development Department, which is also responsible for 12 other government schemes. As a result, it&#13;
  is practically impossible for the TSC program to receive due attention.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ The lack of a specific cell for TSC headed by a senior officer may have contributed to the minimal&#13;
  achievement otherwise expected from Himachal Pradesh, considering that CLTS has been&#13;
  implemented for more than three years. One explanation for this could be the lack of an established&#13;
  system for supporting and monitoring progress post-CLTS workshops.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ The capacity and skills for facilitating CLTS do not seem to be widespread across the state. Solan&#13;
  District, for example, seems to have a strong capacity, while CLTS capacity is significantly lower in&#13;
  the blocks visited in Shimla District.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ In order to scale up TSSM in the state, there is a need to have an effective institutional framework and&#13;
  strategy for supporting and monitoring progress. The motivators at the village level should be part of&#13;
  this institution, led by a community leader. Depending on the size of a District, the gram panchayats&#13;
  can be grouped into clusters with a facilitator assigned to each cluster, preferably staff members from&#13;
  the Health, Education, Public Health Engineering (PHE), Women &amp; Child Development, or Rural&#13;
  Development Department. The facilitators would report to a block-level coordinator, preferably the&#13;
  chief executive officers (CEOs), who would then report to the district coordinator. Regular meetings&#13;
  (monthly at the onset) should be held to discuss progress and difficulties. This is not as complicated as&#13;
  it sounds, as the institutional framework is already in existence and these suggestions only put it to&#13;
  good use.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ Although there is a clear state sanitation strategy, its awareness and implementation in the district is&#13;
  very minimal, hence the disparity in the use of the latrine subsidy. In some districts, subsidies are&#13;
  given directly to households and sometimes even extended to families above the poverty line. This is&#13;
                                                     vii&#13;
Global Scaling Up Sanitation Project&#13;
&amp;#12;   clearly against the recommendations in the state strategy, which indicates that a subsidy should be&#13;
   given as an incentive when a community has achieved open defecation free (ODF) status.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ The strategy for sanitation promotion is unclear. A nongovernmental organization (NGO) has been&#13;
  contracted to implement the information, education, and communication (IEC) component of TSC in&#13;
  more than eight districts. The NGO may be disinclined to use the CLTS approach, which could prove&#13;
  incompatible with the Global Scaling Up Sanitation Project in these districts.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ Latrine technology in Himachal Pradesh can be divided into dry and wet latrines, including low- and&#13;
  high-cost options.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ One striking discovery is the extremely high-cost method of latrine construction. This type of latrine,&#13;
  generally known as a â&#128;&#156;pacaâ&#128;? latrine, costs between Rs30,000â&#128;&#147;Rs45,000 (US$750â&#128;&#147; $1,125). It consists&#13;
  of a large septic tank with reinforced concrete lining and a brick superstructure with a reinforced&#13;
  concrete roof. The insides of the latrines are often finished to a very high standard with matching tiles,&#13;
  squat pan, and shower units. It is not known how and when this technology was introduced, but it&#13;
  seems to be the aspiration of many households. Some families prefer to wait until they can afford such&#13;
  latrines. The bulk of the cost of the â&#128;&#156;pacaâ&#128;? is in the lining of the septic tank.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ Himachal Pradesh also offers interesting innovative low-cost latrine options designed by individuals.&#13;
  These options are, however, scattered across the state and not really documented to facilitate&#13;
  knowledge transfer.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ One approach for ensuring that a menu of low-cost latrine options is offered to households across the&#13;
  state is to compile a latrine catalogue. The catalogue should also indicate which option is suitable for&#13;
  the various areas of the state, depending on their geological formation, and an estimated cost for each&#13;
  option.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ In the districts visited, the government seems open to various low-cost latrine technology options.&#13;
  There is also a perception that they are keen for villages to become truly ODF, rather than just&#13;
  counting the number of latrines built.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ The sanitation supply market is well established and completely controlled by the private sector. Most&#13;
  latrine construction materials and components are easily accessible even in the most remote parts of&#13;
  the state. Retailers of sanitary wares are keen to stock components of any latrine that is or will&#13;
  potentially be in demand.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ The major information gap in the supply market regards the capacity of masons to construct low-cost&#13;
  latrines. It is generally known that all the masons are from outside of the state. There has been no&#13;
  known training on low-cost latrines organized for the masons in Himachal Pradesh.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Findings from Madhya Pradesh&#13;
â&#128;¢ There has been an increase in awareness of the TSC program among the government and communities&#13;
  over the past year. This has resulted in increased targets for the NGP award across the districts. At the&#13;
  time of the assessment, the TSC program was in the process of being transferred from the PHE to the&#13;
  Rural Development Department.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ The concept of CLTS is new in Madhya Pradesh, and there is limited capacity to implement it in the&#13;
  state. Over the years, a subsidy has been the main approach used in government sanitation programs.&#13;
  It would therefore not be surprising that the government is less keen to adopt the CLTS approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    viii&#13;
Global Scaling Up Sanitation Project&#13;
&amp;#12;â&#128;¢ A good example is in Khandwa District, where a training-of-trainers workshop on CLTS was held.&#13;
  There was no mention of the training by either government staff or community members who attended&#13;
  the training until they were asked. The TSC program was â&#128;&#156;business as usual,â&#128;? and subsidies were&#13;
  given to every household, sometimes a higher amount than recommended.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ It is hoped that with the transfer of TSC to the Rural Development Department (a less construction-&#13;
  oriented department), there will be more interest to adopt the CLTS approach. This will require&#13;
  continuous and joint advocacy by the Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) and other key players in&#13;
  the state such as UNICEF.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ It is also important for WSP to review the contents of the CLTS training manual and differentiate&#13;
  between materials for trainers and those for motivators. Separate training workshops should be&#13;
  organized for motivators and trainers. The District Administration where training is being organized&#13;
  should be advised and given the criteria for nominating people as either trainers or motivators, if this&#13;
  is not already been done.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ Although CLTS is new in the state, it was discovered during the field visits that a demand-driven&#13;
  sanitation project with similar principles to CLTS (non-subsidy based) has been successfully&#13;
  implemented in Betul and Chhindwara Districts under a UNICEF project.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ The appointment of a collector who was the CEO when the above-mentioned project was&#13;
  implemented in Betul could be a good opportunity for WSP to build on and introduce CLTS. The&#13;
  major difficulty will be to implement a sanitation project without a subsidy in the current climate.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ Unlike in Himachal Pradesh where there are various latrine options, MP is restricted to only one&#13;
  option with limited flexibility even down to the degree of sloping in squat pans. The PHE Department&#13;
  prescribed the size of the pit, lining methods, and even the size and type of the superstructure.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ Because the government is highly involved in the supply of sanitation facilities using a subsidy,&#13;
  households are reluctant to build their own latrines or even make any innovative modifications. This&#13;
  could also explain the reason for the absence of very high-cost latrines as seen in Himachal Pradesh.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ The sanitation supply market in the state is well established, but the majority of its business is with the&#13;
  government rather than individual households. Retailers supply most construction materials to the&#13;
  government, which also contracts and directly pays masons.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ The retail shops stock all latrine construction materials and components of most latrines but rarely&#13;
  stock the rural pan with the prescribed slope. The reason is that there is minimal individual demand for&#13;
  rural pans so they only order these supplies when the government puts in an order.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ Government and privately owned rural sanitary marts (RSMs) were visited in Betul District. While the&#13;
  government RSMs were nonfunctional and only stocked rural pans at a higher cost, private RSMs&#13;
  were running effectively and stocked most construction materials including other types of squat pans.&#13;
  Most of the private RSMs were initially supported by UNICEF under a revolving fund. The private&#13;
  retailers of sanitary hardware stocked more varieties of toilet components. It may therefore be more&#13;
  sustainable to allow the private sector to continue to play the supply role for toilet components and&#13;
  materials.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ The findings from Madhya Pradesh strongly support the assertion that the sanitation supply market is&#13;
  more sustainable and effective when managed by the private sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Global Scaling Up Sanitation Project&#13;
&amp;#12;â&#128;¢ One strong advantage that the supply market in Madhya Pradesh has over that of Himachal Pradesh is&#13;
  the availability of masons who have been trained in latrine construction all over the state. These&#13;
  masons are often local and sometimes from the vicinity where they deliver services.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ Madhya Pradesh is one of Indiaâ&#128;&#153;s largest states and also has a high tribal population that often requires&#13;
  a slightly different approach to development projects. The tribal populations have a very low literacy&#13;
  level and are mostly below the poverty line. It is not uncommon to find that latrines are not being used&#13;
  in parts of an NGP village inhabited by a tribal population. Tribal communities often require constant&#13;
  and longer support in order to achieve ODF status.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢ The size of Madhya Pradesh may mean that it would not be possible for WSP to target the entire state&#13;
  within the timeframe of this project. It would be more feasible to identify and focus on a few districts&#13;
  to demonstrate the strength of the CLTS approach.&#13;

negative impact of a direct household                         example, the panchayat subsidizes the&#13;

household subsidy, the strategy indicates                     working on targets rather than on demand&#13;

To facilitate the scaling up of TSSM, a              A key gap in the supply market is the lack of&#13;
comprehensive menu of latrine options                knowledge of the activities of masons who&#13;

&amp;#12;overall responsibility of feeding results into         state sanitation strategies are disseminated&#13;
the central report card for TSC and ensuring           and used for implementation at the district&#13;
that all promotion materials and tools are             with the support of external agencies. In&#13;
distributed to the motivators on completion            Madhya Pradesh, WSP should work with&#13;
of CLTS training. He or she should also                UNICEF to ensure that the strategy is&#13;
have the responsibility of planning quarterly          compiled and approved and also support&#13;
monitoring meetings to the blocks and                  CLTS awareness workshops. The CCDU&#13;
circulating information on dates for                   unit should be the main training resource for&#13;
monitoring meetings. It is also absolutely             TSSM in the two states and should therefore&#13;
important that the collector buys into the             be equipped with the capacity to train&#13;
CLTS approach and is convinced that it                 trainers and motivators on the CLTS&#13;
would yield better and more sustainable                approach. UNICEF is already supporting the&#13;
results. It is therefore important that all            Water and Land Management Institute&#13;
collectors attend an awareness and advocacy            (WALMI), which is the base for the TSC&#13;
workshop at the state level prior to initiating        CCDU to train various stakeholders to&#13;
TSSM.                                                  implement TSC. Although the training&#13;
                                                       contains some PRA components, it is not&#13;
State level                                            necessarily directed at the CLTS approach.&#13;
                                                       It is therefore important for WSP to liaise&#13;
The state level should have a specific TSC             with UNICEF to ensure that WALMI&#13;
cell headed by a senior officer (IAS) and              resource people acquire CLTS training skills&#13;
supported by a capacity-building team                  and tools to enable them to serve as the state&#13;
(CCDU). In Madhya Pradesh, a TSC cell                  CLTS resource center. The same approach&#13;
was in the PHE Department and has now                  needs to be adapted for Himachal Pradesh to&#13;
been moved to the Rural Development                    ensure that there is a CLTS resource center&#13;
Department. The TSC project directors in               at the state level rather than concentrating on&#13;
both states will have the role of ensuring that        a few districts.&#13;

            This report documents findings from the
            situation assessment of the supply market for rural
            sanitation in Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh within the
            context of current state-level sanitation programs. In the
            introductory material, the report presents an overview of
            the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) in India, then in
            Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Section 2 provides a
            situation assessment of the sanitation supply market in both
            those areas. Section 3 discusses the implications of the
            sanitation market situation in Himachal Pradesh and Madhya
            Pradesh for total sanitation and sanitation marketing (TSSM).
