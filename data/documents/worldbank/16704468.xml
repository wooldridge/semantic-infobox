From toilet construction to collective behavior change&#13;
&#13;
Previous experiences using           infrastructure oriented approaches in sanitation&#13;
interventions led to poor progress on outputs and outcomes. Building on this experience,&#13;
many countries have recently adopted a behavior change approach to improving&#13;
sanitation. The primary focus of this approach is changing the behaviors of individuals,&#13;
households and communities, rather than promoting            toilets. Raising community&#13;
awareness about the need for better sanitation leads to increased demand and&#13;
acceptance. This approach is more likely to be sustainable.&#13;
&#13;
In India, the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) launched in 1999.signalled a paradigm&#13;
shift with the adoption of a behavior change approach â&#128;&#147; one that emphasized a&#13;
community led approach to total sanitation.                Similar Community Led Total&#13;
Sanitation (CLTS) initiatives have been initiated in other countries including Bangladesh,&#13;
Pakistan, Indonesia, Cambodia, Ethiopia and Bolivia among others.&#13;
&#13;
Increasing the demand for sanitation improvements would generate little sustainable&#13;
change if the supply of sanitation products and services did not develop simultaneously.&#13;
. Access to a range of affordable product options at convenient locations at the right&#13;
time- when demand is generated, - is essential to the process of achieving a Total&#13;
Sanitation community. Facilitating the development of a market to supply products,&#13;
through private entrepreneurship (to ensure sustainability) is a key component of this&#13;
approach.&#13;
&#13;
Moving Beyond Projects: Scaling up and Sustaining Sanitation Improvement&#13;
&#13;
The approach of increasing demand through a community- led behavior change focus&#13;
is promising in terms of achieving Open Defecation Free (ODF) communities , which can&#13;
then go on to achieve Total Sanitation (communitywide adoption of a set of key&#13;
sanitation and hygiene practices). There are however two major challenges:&#13;
&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Sustaining the outcomes: Behavior change, especially at the community level, is&#13;
       challenging to sustain over a long period of time. After the initial euphoria of&#13;
       improving sanitation outputs and outcomes, a slip back to the previous behavior&#13;
       patterns is often encountered.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Scaling Up: Expanding the achievements of a few communities to hundreds and&#13;
       thousands of communities across a district, state/province or country is another&#13;
       major challenge. Although projects provide the initial momentum, similar&#13;
       initiatives have failed to scale up.&#13;
&#13;
   In addition to increasing demand and improving the supply of sanitation products&#13;
   and services, a third program component is essential to scaling up and sustaining&#13;
   the desired changes, viz, generating an enabling environment.&#13;
&#13;

An Enabling Environment â&#128;&#147; the key to Scaling Up and Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
An enabling environment is defined as the policy, institutional and financial environment&#13;
that promotes self-sustaining growth of DEMAND for, and SUPPLY of, improved&#13;
sanitation. An enabling environment for rural sanitation programs is envisaged to have&#13;
at least eight different dimensions:&#13;
&#13;
   1.   Policy, Strategy and Direction&#13;
   2.   Institutional Arrangements&#13;
   3.   Program Methodology&#13;
   4.   Implementation Capacity&#13;
   5.   Availability of Products and Tools&#13;
   6.   Financing&#13;
   7.   Cost-effective Implementation&#13;
   8.   Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
&#13;
Recognizing and addressing the issues within these eight dimensions is essential to&#13;
facilitate the development of the enabling environment, which supports demand&#13;
generation and supply creation, leading to Total Sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
An enabling environment does not happen on its own, but has to be consciously&#13;
developed. In addition, an enabling environment has to be able to be measured, so that&#13;
progress towards it can be monitored, understood and facilitated.&#13;
&#13;
The Total Sanitation and Sanitation Marketing (TSSM) Project&#13;
&#13;
The TSSM project being implemented in India (Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh),&#13;
Indonesia (East Java) and Tanzania accordingly employs a three-pronged approach:&#13;
increasing consumer DEMAND, enhancing market SUPPLY, and generating an ENABLING&#13;
ENVIRONMENT for rural sanitation. TSSM (2007-2010) is supported by the Bill and&#13;
Melinda Gates Foundation and executed by the Water and Sanitation Program in&#13;
partnership with the three country governments. The goal of TSSM is to help 3.75&#13;
million additional people gain access to improved sanitation by 2010 in the three&#13;
countries, while learning how best to scale up sanitation improvements sustainably,&#13;
cost-effectively and with health and socio-economic impact. and to influence 5-15 more&#13;
countries to apply the learning gained at scale by 2015.&#13;
&#13;
The project supports innovations within existing government programs; develops new&#13;
projects in partnership with the government. Through these efforts, the project hopes to&#13;
facilitate access to improved sanitation for nearly 3.75 million people in the three&#13;
countries and based on what is learned       through the project, replicate it in other&#13;
countries and reaches 250 million people by 2015.&#13;

&#13;
Measuring the Enabling Environment â&#128;&#147; The Spider Diagram&#13;
&#13;
An understanding of current enabling environment (EE) and where it should be helps to&#13;
prioritize and address the critical gaps. To enable this, a set of scales, and a system of&#13;
consolidating scale measurements into a Spider Diagram, has been developed by WSP.&#13;
It is currently being tested with stakeholders in the three countries.&#13;
&#13;
A baseline assessment of the EE was done at the start of the project in 2007 in each&#13;
country. This will be followed by a repeat assessment at end of the TSSM project in&#13;
2010. In addition, annual reviews of progress, with local stakeholders are also&#13;
undertaken.&#13;
&#13;
The measurement method includes ordinal scales for each dimension of EEâ&#128;&#147; 7 point&#13;
scales starting at zero. Each scale has a common description for application across&#13;
countries. For example, Institutional arrangement has the following indicators:&#13;
&#13;
   Â¾    Nodal Ministry/lead national institution identified   1&#13;
   Â¾    Roles and responsibilities for sanitation clear       1&#13;
   Â¾    Coordination mechanism established                    1&#13;
   Â¾    Dedicated budget line in place                        1&#13;
   Â¾    Clear links established with other sectors            1&#13;
   Â¾    Clear operational structure                           1&#13;
&#13;
All scaled dimensions are consolidated into a Spider Diagram. Examples of Spider&#13;
Diagrams from the three countries are based on the Baseline Enabling Environmental&#13;
Assessments carried out in 2007. The scores for 2008, 2009 and 2010 represent results&#13;
expected from Action Plans formulated in each country, in response to the assessments.&#13;
An understanding of the baseline assessment of the enabling environment leads to the&#13;
development of an Action Plan with short, medium and long term goals.&#13;

            Sustaining sanitation beyond projects :
            developing enabling environments for sustaining and scaling
            up sanitation improvements
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Previous experiences using
            infrastructure oriented approaches in sanitation
            interventions led to poor progress on outputs and outcomes.
            Building on this experience, many countries have recently
            adopted a behavior change approach to improving sanitation.
            The primary focus of this approach is changing the behaviors
            of individuals, households and communities, rather than
            promoting toilets. Raising community awareness about the
            need for better sanitation leads to increased demand and
            acceptance. This approach is more likely to be sustainable.
            In India, the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC) launched in
            1999, signalled a paradigm shift with the adoption of a
            behavior change approach - one that emphasized a community
            led approach to total sanitation. Similar Community Led
            Total Sanitation (CLTS) initiatives have been initiated in
            other countries. Increasing the demand for sanitation
            improvements would generate little sustainable change if the
            supply of sanitation products and services did not develop
            simultaneously. Access to a range of affordable product
            options at convenient locations at the right time - when
            demand is generated - is essential to the process of
            achieving a Total Sanitation community. Facilitating the
            development of a market to supply products, through private
            entrepreneurship (to ensure sustainability) is a key
            component of this approach.
