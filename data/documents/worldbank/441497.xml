Privatization and Restructuring in Central&#13;
and Eastern Europe&#13;
Robert E.         This Note reports on the first comprehensive analysis of the industrial restructuring that has&#13;

Claesso1 s&#13;
important factor in restructuring. The method of privatization has been less important: to date&#13;
management buyouts and massive giveaways of firms through voucher privatization have led to&#13;
results similar to those of case-by-case sales to foreign or domestic investors. The study also&#13;
shows that privatizing industrial and commercial firms is the most effective way to improve the&#13;
solvency of the banking sector-more effective than bank recapitalization or debt forgiveness.&#13;

            Privatization and restructuring in Central
            and Eastern Europe
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            One of the most important policy
            questions in the transition economies is what governments
            can do to speed the restructuring of firms and thus hasten
            the transition to a mature market economy. The authors
            report on a study that provides some answers. Privatization
            encourages restructuring if it is rapid and comprehensive
            and leads to concentrated ownership. Privatization also
            promotes restructuring because privatized firms are more
            likely than state-owned enterprises to exercise wage
            restraint--and wage restraint is vital to free up the
            necessary internal finance. But policies that increase bank
            lending to firms, such as debt forgiveness and
            recapitalization, may do more harm than good. The safest
            course is to recapitalize banks only as part of
            privatization and to encourage negotiations for financial
            restructuring only after the banks are privatized.
