            A scorecard for energy reform in developing countries
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Only a handful of developing countries
            have fully reformed their energy sector - oil, gas, and
            power. A World Bank Survey of 115 developing countries shows
            that on average, in mid-1998 just 39 percent of key reform
            steps had been carried out. There are large variations among
            countries in the number of reform steps take, with most
            reforms concentrated in a small number of countries. In a
            great majority of countries, little or no reform has been
            done. This paper compares the results of the survey across
            regions and countries, and looks at how private investment
            has influenced the reforms.
