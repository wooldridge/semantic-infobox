Parliament's role in Poverty reduction strategies&#13;

&#13;
   Parliaments play a crucial role in improving governance and public service delivery. Those countries&#13;
   with strong parliamentary oversight have been able to shape policy directions and priorities. This article&#13;
   explores the growing role of parliaments in crafting poverty reduction strategy papers (PRSPs) since the&#13;
   process was first launched in 1999. Although the parliaments of many developing countries still have a&#13;
   long way to go before they will maximize their ability to strengthen the outcomes from country-level pov-&#13;
   erty reduction strategies (PRSs), the first decade of the poverty reduction strategy process has produced&#13;
   some important examples of the ways that parliaments can get involved, shape the debate, and learn&#13;
   from the experiences of legislatures in other countries. The cases of Tanzania and Malawi illustrate how&#13;
   parliamentary committees and parliaments can develop in terms of policy leverage and leadership.&#13;

  The poverty reduction strategy is intended to pro-&#13;

perspectives, is results oriented, and, most important,&#13;
rests on broadly based participation and country own-       role of Parliament&#13;

            Parliament's role in poverty reduction strategies
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Parliaments play a crucial role in
            improving governance and public service delivery. Those
            countries with strong parliamentary oversight have been able
            to shape policy directions and priorities. This article
            explores the growing role of parliaments in crafting poverty
            reduction strategy papers (PRSPs) since the process was
            first launched in 1999. Although the parliaments of many
            developing countries still have a long way to go before they
            will maximize their ability to strengthen the outcomes from
            country-level poverty reduction strategies (PRSs), the first
            decade of the poverty reduction strategy process has
            produced some important examples of the ways that
            parliaments can get involved, shape the debate, and learn
            from the experiences of legislatures in other countries. The
            cases of Tanzania and Malawi illustrate how parliamentary
            committees and parliaments can develop in terms of policy
            leverage and leadership.
