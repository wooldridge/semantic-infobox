Adopted on May 14, 2014&#13;
(provided for informational purposes only)&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The Consultative Group to Assist the Poor (CGAP) is a global partnership of organizations that seek&#13;
to advance financial inclusion for the poor. CGAP develops innovative solutions to address barriers to&#13;
financial inclusion through practical research and active engagement with financial service providers, policy&#13;
makers, and funders.&#13;
2.     Established in 1995, CGAP initially played a critical role in building a sustainable microfinance&#13;
industry, facilitating consensus around good practice standards and helping to professionalize the field.&#13;
Starting in the mid-2000s, CGAP focused on promoting a diversity of financial services and providers, and in&#13;
particular technology and business model innovations that have the potential to dramatically increase the&#13;
scale and lower the costs of financial services for poor people.&#13;
3.     Today, CGAP is a leading global resource on financial inclusion for the poor. CGAP acts through&#13;
high-level advocacy, research and knowledge sharing on client demand, support for product and business&#13;
model innovation, policy advice, and guidelines and standards for donor effectiveness.&#13;
4.     CGAP pursues a global solutions agenda through a portfolio of high-impact initiatives that evolve&#13;
over time to adapt to changing market developments. CGAP's work on frontier issues crowds-in private,&#13;
social, and public sector entities and reflects the two central purposes of subsidized catalytic capital in the&#13;
promotion of inclusive market development: (i) the generation of open knowledge, open data, and related&#13;
practical insights of a public good nature, and (ii) private and public sector experimentations that&#13;
demonstrate viable product and business model innovations.&#13;
5.     CGAP is guided by five-year strategic frameworks. Its current five year framework, Advancing&#13;
Financial Inclusion to Improve the Lives of the Poor, Strategic Directions FY2014 - FY2018 (CGAP V), was&#13;
endorsed in May 2013 by CGAP's Council of Governors.&#13;
6.     CGAP is supported by more than 30 member organizations including government ministries,&#13;
bilateral and multilateral development agencies, development finance institutions and foundations committed&#13;
to advancing financial access for the poor. CGAP is housed in the World Bank and is funded through&#13;
member contributions to trust funds administered by the World Bank.&#13;
7.     CGAP's governance structure comprises a Council of Governors, an Executive Committee, and an&#13;
Operational Team.&#13;
CGAP COUNCIL OF GOVERNORS&#13;
8.     The Council of Governors ("CG") is CGAP's highest governing body. The CG is chaired by the&#13;
World Bank and meets in person at least once per year as part of the "CGAP Annual Meeting". The CGAP&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Annual Meeting is the venue for discussion of CG business matters, and for exchange on developments and&#13;
key challenges related to CGAP's strategic priorities.&#13;
CG Membership&#13;
9.     Membership in the CG includes the World Bank and is open to organizations that support CGAP's&#13;
vision and mission statements. Organizations may become CG members by contributing unrestricted&#13;
funding to CGAP trust funds that support the implementation of the applicable five year strategic framework&#13;
("Core Funding"). On an exceptional basis and subject to the approval of the CG :&#13;
(a)    CG members that express their intention to contribute Core Funding may remain CG&#13;
members provided their contribution is made effective within a reasonable period.&#13;
(b)    Organizations may become CG members by providing in-kind contributions in support of&#13;
the work plan and budget of the Operational Team (described below).&#13;
(c)    A government organization providing Core Funding can form a consortium ("Consortium")&#13;
with other national organizations supported by the same government, in which case the&#13;
Consortium will be the CG member.&#13;
10.   Each CG member appoints a representative to the CG ("CGAP Focal Point") and confirms, on an&#13;
annual basis or as needed in case of changes, to the Operational Team the name and contact information of&#13;
its CGAP Focal Point.&#13;
11.   CG members not meeting the requirements of paragraph 9 are expected to resign by way of&#13;
communication to the Operational Team.&#13;
Roles and Responsibilities&#13;

&#13;
ï»¿Decision-Making&#13;
14.    Documents and other decision materials for CG approval are prepared by the Operational Team. The&#13;
CG endeavors to make all decisions by consensus. If all practical efforts made do not lead to consensus, the&#13;
CG Chair may call for a vote. Decisions put to a vote are made on the basis of a simple majority of the full&#13;
CG, provided that such decisions; (i) do not conflict with terms of the administration agreements between&#13;
CG members and the World Bank as trustee of CGAP trust funds; (ii) must be made with the agreement of&#13;
the World Bank to the extent they relate to the roles and responsibilities performed by the World Bank; and&#13;
(iii) do not conflict with the policies and procedures of any CG member organization. Each CG member has&#13;
one vote in decisions made by the CG. The member organizations of the Consortium share one vote.&#13;
15.    Decisions can be made both in person, including by video or audio, at the CGAP Annual Meeting or&#13;
other CG meeting, or electronically on a non-objection basis. If a CG member is unable to send a&#13;
representative to a meeting at which a decision is being considered for approval, that CG member may&#13;
provide inputs, including a vote if applicable, electronically or by telephone at the time of the meeting. The&#13;
Operational Team will make arrangements for such inputs and/or votes to be reflected in the final decision.&#13;
EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE&#13;
16.    The Executive Committee (ExCom) advises, supports the work of, and is accountable to the CG. It&#13;
serves as the communications link between CG members and the Operational Team.&#13;
17.    The ExCom meets in person three times per year, once in conjunction with the CGAP Annual&#13;
Meeting. The ExCom Chair may call additional meetings as necessary. All ExCom members are eligible to&#13;
vote on ExCom matters.&#13;
18.    ExCom members will not be compensated for their time, but costs associated with At-Large Excom&#13;

CGAP trust fund resources allocated for that purpose.&#13;
Membership&#13;
19.    Composition.  The ExCom has eleven members: one representative for each of the five&#13;
constituencies (see para 20 below), four At-Large selected as individuals based on technical knowledge and&#13;
leadership in CGAP strategic priorities; one representative of the World Bank; and the Chief Executive&#13;
Officer as ex-officio. All ExCom members are expected to be recognized experts in the area of financial&#13;
inclusion and to act in a manner consistent with CGAP's vision and mission.&#13;
20.    Constituency Representation.  CG members are represented on the ExCom according to&#13;
constituencies. There are five constituencies based on organization type to which CG members are assigned:&#13;
two for bilateral donor organizations, one for development finance institutions, one for foundations and one&#13;
for multilateral organizations. Individual member organizations of a Consortium are assigned to a&#13;
constituency based on their organization type. However, no more than one member organization of a given&#13;
Consortium may serve on the ExCom at any given time. The number and composition of constituencies may&#13;
change from time to time reflecting changes in CG membership.&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿21.    Constituency Representative Selection: ExCom members representing constituencies are selected&#13;
from among members of the given constituency, through a nomination and election process initiated by the&#13;

possible, and if not, by simple majority vote of the full constituency.&#13;
22.    At-Large Member Selection: At-Large members are elected by the CG. The process for&#13;
nominating candidates for At-Large membership is initiated and led by a nomination committee comprising&#13;
the ExCom Chair and three to five CG members selected by the ExCom Chair in consultation with the full&#13;
ExCom. The nomination committee undertakes broad consultation with the CG and industry experts and&#13;
solicits names of potential candidates. The nomination committee conducts due diligence on the most&#13;
promising candidates and nominates to the CG one candidate per open At-Large ExCom seat.&#13;
23.    Member Terms: ExCom member terms are three years beginning on July 1 following selection.&#13;
All ExCom members are eligible to serve a succeeding two year term. Elected ExCom members must be re-&#13;
elected to such succeeding term. In exceptional circumstances, the CG may approve an extension of an&#13;
ExCom member's term for up to one additional year. If an elected ExCom member is unable to serve a full&#13;
term, the ExCom Chair will initiate the process of selection of that member's successor. The term of the&#13;
newly selected ExCom member will be the period from the date of selection to the end of the term of their&#13;
predecessor plus three years starting July I after their selection. ExCom membership is not transferrable.&#13;
24.    ExCom members are expected to be willing and able to serve their applicable term and to dedicate&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿ANNEX 2&#13;
Standard Provisions&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements between the&#13;
Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
1.     Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1    The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in this&#13;
Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;
under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement shall be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any&#13;
applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2    Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time,&#13;
including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to&#13;
prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to&#13;
finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the&#13;
Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge&#13;
that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset&#13;
control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual member country that may apply to a&#13;
Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be kept&#13;
separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be commingled&#13;
with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee, has legal title to the&#13;
funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States Dollars (the&#13;
"Holding Currency").&#13;
2.3    Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their respective&#13;
Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency other than the&#13;
Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions,&#13;
the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on&#13;
the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of&#13;
exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any&#13;
additional financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies as&#13;
may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion.&#13;
2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their disbursement&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of trust funds&#13;
13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment to the Trust Fund to be&#13;
used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
3.     Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1    The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each Installment, an&#13;
amount equal to two percent (2%) per Installment as an administrative fee for the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2    In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for program management and&#13;
Trust Fund administration, that are (i) not covered by the percentage deduction specified above as an&#13;
administrative fee and (ii) not included under Annex I of the Administration Agreements in accordance with&#13;
the Bank's applicable policies and procedures shall be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis up to a&#13;
maximum of three percent (3%) of the total Contributions under all Administration Agreements.&#13;
3.3    Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust Fund Fees&#13;
and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions.  If actual Contributions&#13;
significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first Administration&#13;
Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right to&#13;
request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by&#13;
amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable&#13;
to all new Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement existing Administration&#13;
Agreements or from new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
4.     Accounting and Financial Reportin2&#13;

concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based financial reporting for all cash-based trust funds&#13;
as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial statement for all cash-based trust funds together with the Bank's&#13;
external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit shall be borne by the Bank.&#13;
4.4    If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the Bank's&#13;
external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether such an external&#13;
audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope and terms of reference of&#13;
such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange for such&#13;
external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of the Bank with respect to such&#13;
audit, shall be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;

conduct of such review or evaluation, and the Bank shall provide all relevant information within the limits of&#13;
the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including any costs incurred by the&#13;
Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation will not constitute a&#13;
financial, compliance or other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;
6.     Disbursement; Cancellation; Refund&#13;
6.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the Bank by June&#13;

for the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns to Donors) after such date to the extent&#13;

Donors. Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank shall return any remaining balance of the Trust&#13;
Fund to each Donor in the Holding Currency in the manner specified in its respective Administration&#13;
Agreement on a pro rata basis with regard to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by such Donor&#13;

and/or other third parties for the purposes of this Administration Agreement, including any Grant&#13;
Agreements, prior to the receipt of such notice. In the event of a cancellation, the Bank shall return to the&#13;
Donor its pro-rata share in the Holding Currency as specified in the Administration Agreement; unless&#13;
otherwise agreed between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
7.     Disclosure; Dispute Resolution&#13;
7.1    The Bank shall disclose the Administration Agreements and related information on this Trust Fund&#13;

Agreements, the Donors consent to such disclosure of their respective Administration Agreements and such&#13;
related information.&#13;
7.2    The Donors and the Bank shall use their best efforts to amicably settle any dispute, controversy, or&#13;
