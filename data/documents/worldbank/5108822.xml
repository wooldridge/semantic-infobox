            This Note explores the relationship
            between the size of the small and medium-size enterprise
            (SME) sector and economic growth and poverty reduction.  A
            new study finds no support for the widely held belief that
            SMEs promote higher growth and lower pover ty.  But it does
            provide some support for the view that the quality of the
            business environment facing all firms, large and small,
            influences economic growth.
