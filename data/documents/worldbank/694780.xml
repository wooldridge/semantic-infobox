This report is based on the ESW undertaken in Senegal through the Africa Regional Program "Review of Policies in the&#13;
Traditional Energy Sector - RPTES" between 1993 and 1996. A draft Project Implementation Document prepared by the&#13;
Government of Senegal was pre-appraised in November 1996, and appraised in March 1997. The ESW and project teams&#13;
comprised Messrs./Mmes. Boris Utria (Economist and Task Team Leader), Max Wilton (Senior Energy Economist), Ignatius&#13;
Menezes (Senior Economist), Demba Balde (Participation Specialist/NGO Liaison Officer), Mathieu Koumoin (Energy&#13;
Economist), Azedine Ouerghi (Energy Economist), Kishor Uprety (Lawyer), Amadou Toure (Procurement Specialist), Ellery&#13;
Stokes (Participation Specialist), Suzanne Roddis (Program Assistant), Susana Hristodoulakis (Operations Analyst), and&#13;
Salimna Haddour (Project Assistant). Catherine Cassagne and Simon Rietbergen were the peer reviewers of the project.&#13;

Project Objectives&#13;
and Description:       The objective of the project is to meet an important part of the rapidly growing&#13;
urban demand for household fuels, without the loss of forest cover and the&#13;
ecosystem's carbon sequestration potential and biodiversity. This objective&#13;
would be met through: (a) the implementation and monitoring of 300,000&#13;
hectares of environmentally sustainable community-managed forest resource&#13;
systems in the Tambacounda and Kolda regions of Senegal, creating a protection&#13;
zone around the Niokolo-Koba National Park (Biosphere Reserve); (b) the&#13;
promotion of inter-fuel substitution and improved stoves initiatives; and (c) the&#13;
strengthening of the institutions involved in the management of the sector, and&#13;
the promotion of the participation of the civil society (private sector, academic&#13;
institutions, and NGOs community) in the operation of the sector. The project&#13;
would finance: (a) an assessment of vegetation cover, an assessment of&#13;
availability of dead wood and other preparatory activities; (b) community-based&#13;
forest management activities in 300,000 ha; (c) promotion of rural-based micro-&#13;
enterprises and private sector and NGO-based inter-fuel substitution activities;&#13;
(d) consultant services for supervision work, delivery of services and various&#13;
technical studies; (e) technical assistance; and (d) materials, equipment and&#13;
goods.&#13;
Project Benefits:       The project would: (a) sustainably produce some 860,000 tons of fuelwood&#13;
(equivalent to 155,000 tons of charcoal) during the implementation period and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
iv&#13;
would thereafter establish a permanent system capable of producing more than&#13;
300,000 tons of fuelwood (equivalent to 55,000 tons of charcoal or half of the&#13;
annual consumption of the city of Dakar) per year on a sustainable basis; (b)&#13;
reduce woodfuels-related deforestation in the Tambacounda and Kolda regions&#13;
by some 10,000 ha/year, reduce net C02 emissions by 510,000 tons/year and&#13;
reduce the loss of biodiversity by the establishment of sustainable forest systems&#13;
and the establishment of a protective buffer zone around the Niokolo-Koba&#13;
National Park (international "Biosphere reserve"); (c) generate employment and&#13;
economic development opportunities in 250 rural villages in the Tambacounda&#13;
and Kolda regions, paying special attention to gender equity; (d) generate a total&#13;
of more than US $10.0 million in direct revenues to 250 villages from the trade&#13;
of woodfuels, and generate additional revenues to the communities from related&#13;
natural resource management and exploitation activities (agriculture,&#13;
pastoralism, herding, agro-forestry, etc.); (e) on a sustainable annual basis after&#13;
the end of the project, generate direct revenues in excess of US $3.0 million to&#13;
the participating villages from the trade of woodfuels, and generate additional&#13;
revenues from related natural resource management and exploitation activities;&#13;
(f) reduce C02 emissions by 42,000 tons/year by the distribution of 225,000&#13;
improved charcoal stoves; (g) increase the availability and access of low income&#13;
households to more reliable and efficient charcoal stoves and to modern fuels;&#13;
and (h) strengthen the planning, policy making and implementation supervision&#13;
capacity of the traditional energy sector institutions, while increasing the&#13;
participation of the civil society (private sector, academic institutions, and NGOs&#13;
community) in the management and operation of the sector.&#13;
Project Risks:          There is a moderate risk that existing charcoal traders and laborers would resist&#13;
transferring part of the industry's activity to the rural communities. To mitigate&#13;
that risk, the project includes two sub-components to support the adjustment of&#13;
existing traders and several monitoring and evaluation mechanisms to track&#13;
possible implementation interference. There is also the possibility that&#13;
traditional traders could switch charcoal production to other areas of the country&#13;
but this risk is considered negligible. The risk that the rural populations might&#13;
not be able to achieve full sustainable management of the forest resources cannot&#13;
be ruled out. Nevertheless, even a partial achievement of the objectives would&#13;
still result in an important transfer of welfare to the rural communities with&#13;
unquestionable economic development opportunities and social benefits and&#13;
significant national and global environmental benefits. There would be no&#13;
involuntary resettlement as a result of the project.&#13;

SUSTAINABLE AND PARTICIPATORY ENERGY MANAGEMENT PROJECT&#13;
I.  BACKGROUND&#13;
A. GEOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE&#13;
1.1.   Senegal's topography is generally flat, and altitude is less than 50 meters above sea level&#13;
over 75 percent of the territory. Senegal has a semi-arid tropical Sudano-Sahelian climate, with&#13;
a relatively narrow temperature span. The rainy season is limited to a single summer monsoon&#13;
and rainfall has declined significantly in the last 40 years. It fluctuates widely from one region&#13;
to another, ranging from 1,000 mm/year in the south to less than 300 mm/year in the north.&#13;
Vegetation runs from bushy steppes in the north to forest stands in the south and southeast. The&#13;
central regions consist of Sudano-Sahelian and Sudano Savannah. Senegal's soils are dry and&#13;
sandy in the north, ferrous in the central regions and lateritic in the south. In general, fertility is&#13;
very poor and the soil is extremely vulnerable to wind and erosion from rain.&#13;
B. DEMOGRAPHICS&#13;
1.2   In 1988, Senegal's population was 6.9 million. Of which 39 percent was living in urban,&#13;
making Senegal the most highly urbanized country in the Sahel region. Women make up 51.4&#13;
percent of the total population and children under age 15, 30 percent. National demographic&#13;
growth is estimated at 2.9 percent per year (3.8% in urban areas and 2.1% in the countryside). If&#13;
current demographic trends remain unchanged, total population will rise to some 12.6 million by&#13;
the year 2010, of which 6.1 million will be urban (48%), with 3.4 million people clustered in the&#13;
Dakar region alone. Urban growth will increase demand for food, fuel, timber and other natural&#13;
goods and services. If the productivity of natural resources does not increase and they are not&#13;
managed sustainably, it will be necessary to increase imports of food, energy, construction material,&#13;
etc.&#13;
C. THE ECONOMY&#13;
1.3    At independence Senegal had one of the most developed economies in West Africa. Its&#13;
economy deteriorated, however, due to a gradual loss of regional markets, prolonged drought and&#13;
weak management. In 1994, Senegal's gross national product (GNP) was estimated at US&#13;
$3,710 million and its per capita GNP was US $611.&#13;
1.4.   Senegal's adjustment efforts date back to 1980 and were supported  by four Bank&#13;
macroeconomic adjustment operations (SALs) in 1980, 1986, 1987, and 1990, and two sector&#13;
adjustment operations (SECALs), including one in the financial sector in 1989 and another in the&#13;
transport sector in 1991. These adjustment operations contributed towards stabilizing&#13;
macroeconomic conditions and achieved a partial liberalization of the economy. A fourth SAL&#13;
was introduced in 1990 which focused on the removal of labor market rigidities, the reduction of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
government subsidies, and the implementation of a more aggressive privatization program.&#13;
Since the beginning of the 1990s, however, the economy experienced a serious decline with a&#13;
contraction of output in key sector. Low economic activity resulted in a shrinking tax base which&#13;
forced the government to reverse import tariff reduction and to increase the taxation of&#13;
petroleum products. In 1992-93, the economy declined even further as the difficulties of&#13;
pursuing an adjustment strategy based on internal deflationary policies became more acute. The&#13;
fiscal deficit and the balance of payment positions worsened; the fiscal balance (excluding&#13;
grants) declined from a 0.2 percent surplus in 1991 to a 3.9 percent deficit in 1993. During the&#13;
period 1988-1993, Senegal's economic growth stagnated at an average of 1.7 percent per annum.&#13;
1.5   In an attempt to reverse this economic deterioration, in mid 1993 the government&#13;
adopted a series of internal adjustment measures including cuts in public sector wages.&#13;
However, these measures were not sufficient to restore the competitiveness of the economy and&#13;
its growth prospects. The decline in investments and exports, widespread smuggling and custom&#13;
fraud, and increasing macroeconomic imbalances made inevitable the January 1994 devaluation&#13;
of the FCFA. With the devaluation, Senegal has now gained a unique opportunity to restore&#13;
competitiveness and export-led growth, taking advantage of its strategic location and its sizable&#13;
human resource base. Increasing GDP growth, reducing inflation and stabilizing prices, and&#13;
reducing the current account and budget deficits are the principal macroeconomic challenges&#13;
facing Senegal for the foreseeable future. Generating a strong supply-response by the private&#13;
sector, increasing labor productivity, improving natural resource management patterns to reduce&#13;
environmental degradation and loss of productive capacity, revitalizing urban enclaves and&#13;
promoting rural development opportunities will all have to be actively pursued if those&#13;
challenges are to be met.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
II. THE SECTORAL CONTEXT&#13;
A. ENERGY SOURCES AND CONSUMPTION&#13;
2.1.   Senegal has a modest but relatively diversified energy resource base. Under present&#13;
conditions, however, its use is associated with either major environmental risks (forest-based&#13;
fuels - fuelwood and charcoal) or substantial investment outlays for exploration (hydrocarbons,&#13;
lignite) and mobilization (hydroelectricity, solar and wind power).&#13;
1.    Fossil Fuels&#13;
2.2    Senegal is largely dependent on expensive imported petroleum products. Fossil fuels in the&#13;
form of heavy petroleum was discovered in the 1950s at the Dome Flore in Casamance (100&#13;
million tons) and natural gas and light petroleum in the 1960s at Diam Nadio Kabor near Dakar.&#13;
Between 1987 and 1992 these reserved produced 61,000 barrels of crude and 31 million m3 of&#13;
natural gas. In 1991 a deposit of 400 million m3 of gas was discovered at Diam Nadio and is&#13;
being used for power generation. An additional gas deposit estimated at 10 million m3 was&#13;
discovered at at the same location in 1996, but it will take some time before it can be economically&#13;
mobilized. Since there is no residential piped gas infrastructure in Senegal the new natural gas&#13;
discovery will not be a factor in foreseeable household interfuel substitution schemes. There is a&#13;
reserve of peat of some 39 million m3 along the Dakar coast at St. Louis.&#13;
2.    Hydro&#13;
2.3    The country's hydroelectric potential, based on the Senegal and Gambia rivers, is estimated&#13;
at about 1,000 MW capable of producing 280 Gwh in an average year. The development of the&#13;
Senegal River under the OMVS should make it possible to have a supply of hydroelectric power&#13;
generated by facilities at the Manantali site in Mali. It is expected that this could provide Senegal&#13;
with 280 GWh/year (out of total domestic consumption of some 900 GWh) and would save&#13;
SENELEC (National Electricity Company) some 150,000 tons of fuel per year of the current&#13;
consumption of 300,000 tons.&#13;
3.    Traditional Fuels (Fuelwood and Charcoal)&#13;
2.4    The potential supply of energy wood is not well known. In 1980, forest land was&#13;
estimated at 12 million ha (60% of the country's area), with very variable types of stands:&#13;
closed and open forest represent 20 percent of the woodlands and Savannah and steppe 80&#13;
percent. Depending on the source and assumptions used, annual total productivity was&#13;
estimated for that same year to be between 13.4 million m3 (1991 PASF/terroir management&#13;
studies) and 8.6 million m3 (1981 PDDF). Availability was estimated in 1980 at 7.3 million&#13;
m3/year (PDDF) and accessible reserves at 3.1 million m3/year (PAFS, World Bank). Table 2.1&#13;
presents 1980 estimates of Senegal's forestry potential. It is estimated that some 80,000 ha of&#13;
forest stands disappear each year due to land clearing for agriculture, bush fires, the production&#13;
of charcoal, overgrazing and scarce rainfall. Annual deforestation for charcoal production alone&#13;
is estimated at more than 30,000 ha per year. In the last ten years, an average of 190,000 ha/year&#13;
was lost to forest fires throughout the national territory.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
2.5    A recent study conducted by the government of Senegal with World Bank support&#13;
concluded that the availability of woody biomass in Senegal may have been previously&#13;
underestimated both in terms of volume of stocks and yield potential.2  Available forest stock&#13;
information (estimated on the basis of primary data collected prior to 1980) indicates that&#13;
there are some 44,000 km2 of woodlands and forests, 29,000 km2 of savanna woodlands,&#13;
43,000 km2 of savannas and 32,000 km2 of Sahelian steppe grasslands. Yields are now&#13;
estimated to be between 1 ton/ha/yr and 2 ton/ha/yr, depending on the geographic location and&#13;
specific stock composition. Under improved rainfall condition, natural stocks growth could be&#13;
even higher. Pending confirmation by a comprehensive assessment of vegetation cover in the&#13;
Tambacounda and Kolda regions (included in the proposed project), it is now estimated that&#13;
Senegal should still have sufficient forest resources to meet most -- if not all -- of the demand&#13;
for woodfuels for at least the next two decades under sustainable forest management schemes.&#13;
Implementing sustainable management would imply exploiting the existing forest stocks at or&#13;
below the annual growth (yield) level and would therefore result in maintaining the original&#13;
stocks over time.&#13;

4.     Other Potential Resources&#13;
2.6.   There is a relatively large availability of agricultural residues, but their energy use has&#13;
not yet prove to be more attractive than their use as fertilizers and/or cattle supplements. On the&#13;
other hand, byproducts from agro-industrial processing such as groundnut shells and bagasse offer&#13;
more attractive prospects and have been used by the industries that produce them (SONACOS and&#13;
CSS) to generate electricity for some time. With an average daily radiation of some 5.4 kWh/mi2&#13;
Senegal has a considerable solar energy potential for applications such as small scale electricity&#13;
production (PV), water pumping and heating and drying of fish and agricultural products.&#13;

5.     Energy Consumption&#13;
2.8.   Total final energy consumption in Senegal for 1992 was estimated at some 1.5 million&#13;
tons of oil equivalent (TOE), and a per capita energy consumption of 195 kilograms of oil&#13;
equivalent (KOE), which is relatively high compared to most West African countries. Out of the&#13;
estimated total energy consumption, forest-based traditional fuels (firewood and charcoal) --&#13;
mostly used for household cooking purposes -- represented 53 percent, petroleum fuels 34&#13;
percent, electricity 12 percent and agricultural residues I percent. The household sector is the&#13;
principal energy consumer (58%) followed by transport (20%), industry (17%) and the tertiary&#13;
sector (5%). Total charcoal consumption in 1992 was estimated at 330,000 tons (equivalent to&#13;
1.8 million tons of fuelwood), of which 76 percent is consumed in the principal urban areas. The&#13;
city of Dakar alone has an estimated consumption of almost 150,000 tons of charcoal per year.&#13;
Total consumption of fuelwood was estimated at some 1.5 million tons in 1992, 86 percent of&#13;
which is consumed in the rural areas. Tables 2.2 and 2.3 present final energy consumption by&#13;
energy resource and by economic sectors, respectively.&#13;

B. ENERGY SECTOR INSTITUTIONS AND POLICIES&#13;
1.    Sectoral Institutions&#13;
2.9.   Institutional structure and actors. Energy policy choices, directions and coordination are&#13;
overseen by the National Energy Commission, an inter-ministerial entity chaired by the Prime&#13;
Minister. The National Energy Committee headed by the Minister of Energy implements the&#13;
directives formulated by the Commission. Administrative and technical oversight of the sector falls&#13;
under the Ministry of Energy, Mining and Industry (MEMI) with the exception of the supply of&#13;
woodfuels, which is the responsibility of the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of Nature&#13;
(MEPN). MEMI oversees certain parastatal companies and mixed-capital enterprises: SENELEC,&#13;
in charge of electric power production, transmission and distribution; SAR (African Refining&#13;
Company), responsible for imports and production of petroleum products; GPP (Petroleum Trade&#13;
Group), responsible for the distribution of petroleum products; PETROSEN (Senegal Petroleum&#13;
Company), responsible for oil exploration; and CTS (Senegal Peat Company), responsible for the&#13;
development of peat reserves.  Other ministries are key players, including the Ministry of the&#13;
Economy, Finance and Planning; the Ministry of Infrastructure and Land Transportation,&#13;
responsible for oversight of hydrocarbon transportation; the Ministry of Modernization and&#13;
Technology and the Ministry of Water Resources, both of which are involved in solar energy&#13;
programs; the Ministry of National Education, which has oversight of the CERER (Center for&#13;
Study and Research on Renewable Energy); ENSUT (National School for Advanced Studies in&#13;
Technology); and the "Cellule de Combustibles Domestiques", which is an inter-ministerial body&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
created in 1993 to serve as a formal link between the different governmental institutions and&#13;
operators in the sector.&#13;
2.10.  From the different ministries that play an operational role in the household and traditional&#13;
energy sectors, MEPN is by far the best organized and endowed in human and material resources&#13;
and is technically capable of fulfilling its assigned responsibilities. Currently MEPN is managing&#13;
some 300 projects through out the country, most of which are donor- supported and which include&#13;
capacity building and institutional development components. The Water and Forest Directorate&#13;
(DEF/MEPN) has implemented a gradual reorganization process over the last two years, giving&#13;
special priority to the strengthening of its regional structures. That process was implemented as&#13;
part of the ongoing process of administrative decentralization to increase the Forestry Service's&#13;
supervision and field extension services. While the forestry service, including the several technical&#13;
support units (forestry operations, planning, cartography, monitoring and evaluation, etc.) has&#13;
sufficient and technically qualified staff to undertake complex projects, the multi-sectoral nature of&#13;
participatory forest management systems will require the mobilization of additional expertise from&#13;
other governmental agencies (agriculture extension, rural development, women affairs, rural&#13;
infrastructure, etc.) and the NGO community.&#13;
2.11   MEMI, on the other hand, has serious limitations in its ability to effectively discharge its&#13;
assigned responsibilities as it lacks the necessary staff and resources to do so and has little control&#13;
over the operation of the enterprises it is supposed to oversee. With institutional development&#13;
support from the World Bank and the Dutch and German Cooperations the Energy Directorate has&#13;
recently managed to improve its situation, but the strengthening of its planning and policy making&#13;
and supervision functions are still badly needed. This will imply moving away from actual field&#13;
implementation of projects -- which has been the traditional means of securing resources -- and&#13;
focusing on more on analytical and planning functions and sector monitoring and supervision.&#13;
2.12   Coordination and institutional problems in the power sector are similar to those&#13;
encountered in the petroleum sectors. In addition to that, poor management of SENELEC has led&#13;
to a growing deficit of power generation capacity, deterioration of facilities, low level of access to&#13;
electricity, and high costs. SAR's refinery is uneconomic and has led to high prices of petroleum&#13;
products.&#13;
2.    Sectoral Policies&#13;
2.13   The national energy policy is set forth in the RENES program formulated in 1980 and&#13;
revised in 1991 and in the document issued by the Inter-ministerial Energy Council (1993). The&#13;
global objectives of the GoS energy policy are: (a) to limit consumption of imported energy; (b) to&#13;
rehabilitate the electric power production and transmission infrastructure; (c) to shift production&#13;
and consumption toward local energy sources; and (d) to reduce consumption of environmentally&#13;
destructive energy sources (wood and charcoal).&#13;
2.14   Official forestry policy, establishing new post-colonial guidelines for exploitation of&#13;
woodfuels, was initially addressed by the Master Forestry Development Plan (1981). The&#13;
Master Plan was then revised during the formulation of the Forestry Action Plan (1993) and is&#13;
now framed within the new forestry code of April 1995 (Decret 95-357). This new code&#13;
introduced major changes to the previous regulatory framework, including the recognition of the&#13;
rights of the local communities to exploit state-owned forest land and to capture revenues&#13;
directly from their regulated exploitation. In addition to those significant changes, the legislative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
decrees sanctioning the administrative decentralization have already been signed, with which&#13;
local communities are, inter alia, further insulated from centralized decisions on forest and&#13;
natural resource issue.&#13;
2.15   The GoS has now articulated its energy policy around the following points:&#13;
*  the stabilization of the potential supply of woodfuels through the transfer of&#13;
responsibility for the management of natural forests from the Forestry Service to the&#13;
local community and the implementation of sustainable community-based forest&#13;
management systems;&#13;
*  the sustainable exploitation of existing natural forests and the rationalization of&#13;
forestry operations through the implementation of a national participatory natural&#13;
resource management program;&#13;
*  the diversification of fuels available to consumers, by developing the use of butane,&#13;
introducing peat-based charcoal briquettes to the market and studying the&#13;
possibilities for using kerosene for cooking;&#13;
*  savings in consumption (improved stoves) and in the transformation of wood into&#13;
charcoal (better carbonization methods); and&#13;
-  a shift towards full cost pricing of energy products so that the market prices reflect&#13;
the real economic costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

III. THE HOUSEHOLD ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
A. ENERGY CONSUMPTION IN THE HOUSEHOLD SECTOR&#13;
3.1.   There were an estimated 1.3 million households in Senegal in 1992 with an average size&#13;
of 6 persons. In Dakar alone there were an estimated 156 thousand households, with an average&#13;
household size of 12 persons. The consumption of energy by the household sector was estimated&#13;
in 1992 at about 0.9 million toe. That total was made of 1.5 million tons of wood, 330,000 tons&#13;
of charcoal (equivalent to more than 3.3 million tons or 4.2 million m3 of wood), 40,000 tons of&#13;
gas butane and some 10,000 tons of kerosene.3 Figure 3.1 presents a breakdown of energy&#13;
consumption by the household sector for 1992. Table 3.1 presents a breakdown of household&#13;
energy consumption by fuel and by region for 1987 and 1992. Table 3.2 presents a breakdown&#13;
of traditional fuels consumption in the household sector in terms of toe and wood equivalence&#13;

3.2.   Household energy demand patterns are determined by a combination of factors including&#13;
but not limited to geographical location (urban/rural and distance/accessibility to supply&#13;
sources), family size, relation between level of household incomes and fuel prices (purchasing&#13;
capacity), market availability of fuels, and cultural habits (fuel choices and method of fuel use).&#13;
An analysis of the tables 3.1 and 3.2 and of various studies in the sector reveals the following key&#13;

* The consumption of fuelwood dominates in the rural areas, gas tends to replace&#13;
charcoal as the primary household fuel in Dakar and Thies (given end-use efficiency&#13;
differences charcoal consumption is still higher than LPG on nominal terms), and&#13;
charcoal is still the main household fuel in the other secondary cities;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
* Gas is making substantial inroads in the principal cities, but charcoal is still consumed&#13;
in large quantities because urban consumers tend to use several fuels, often&#13;
concomitantly;&#13;
* The consumption of charcoal is concentrated in the Cap Vert peninsula and in the&#13;
Thies region, which is home to most of the country's urban dwellers; and&#13;
* Charcoal represents about 27 percent of final consumption of traditional fuels but&#13;
accounts for 55 percent of the out-take of forest resources for energy use. Most of the&#13;
wood collected by rural dwellers comes from dead wood, whereas charcoal is produced&#13;
most of the time from the cutting of live trees. This highlights the high proportion of&#13;
forestry resources extracted for charcoal.&#13;
3.3.   Consumption of LPG has gone from 3,500 tons in 1974 to 16,000 tons in 1987 and then&#13;
to approximately 65,000 tons in 1996.  The penetration of LPG in Senegal has been promoted&#13;
by an aggressive program of cross-fuel subsidies, which is currently estimated at 5 billion FCFA&#13;
per year. The promotion of LPG in Senegal has been primarily supported by the subsidy policy&#13;
of the government since 1974 and by the CILSS/FED Regional Gas Program (1990-93).&#13;
Consumption of LPG has increased by some 12 percent per year for the last five years (well over&#13;
population growth) and by now more than 70 percent of urban households and 25 percent of&#13;
rural families utilize LPG on a regular basis. Nation wide it is estimated that close to 45 percent&#13;
of households have purchased LPG stoves. Furthermore, in 58 percent of households in Dakar&#13;
and 43 percent of households in Thies LPG have replaced charcoal as the primary cooking fuel.&#13;

3.4.   Kerosene is used in the household and informal sector essentially for lighting purposes&#13;
only. A couple of pilot activities were done in the mid 1980s by CERER and the World Bank's&#13;
Energy Management Assistance Program to test the feasibility of introducing kerosene as a&#13;
cooking fuel. Although small consumer trials showed that kerosene could be utilized for&#13;
cooking purposes, a stove fully suited to the local cooking needs was never found. At that time&#13;
the kerosene research was oriented towards finding the most energy efficient stove possible,&#13;
rather than the most "marketable" one, as defined by consumer acceptance.&#13;
3.5.   The consumption of wood energy in the informal and industrial (artisanal) sectors has not&#13;
been studied extensively and therefore is not well known. However, it is thought to be very low&#13;
(5%) in relation to the household sector and very frequently directly associated to it (informal&#13;
household-based enterprises). Small restaurants are the leading commercial energy consumer in the&#13;
cities. A survey conducted in 1991 showed that there were some 3,000 restaurants with an&#13;
estimated annual consumption of 4,200 tons of wood (half of Dakar's fuelwood consumption),&#13;
3,600 tons of charcoal (3% of household consumption) and 700 tons of gas (2% of household&#13;
consumption). Other urban users of woodfuels include tailors (ironing), cloth-dyers, pot makers&#13;
and blacksmiths. Bakeries are permitted to operate wood-fired ovens only in the rural areas.&#13;
B. STRUCTURE AND FUNCTIONING OF THE TRADITIONAL ENERGY MARKETS&#13;
1.    Urban Traditional Energy Markets&#13;
3.6   The supply of woodfuels to the urban and peri-urban areas is based on geographically&#13;
concentrated and non-sustainable forest resource management practices (clear cutting). Given&#13;
the relatively low efficiency of wood-to-charcoal conversion (18%) due to inefficient&#13;
carbonization, total charcoal consumption in terms of wood is equivalent to 1.2 times the total&#13;
consumption of fuelwood. Charcoal for Dakar and Thies and the surrounding peri-urban areas is&#13;
essentially produced in the Kolda and Tambacounda regions, some 400 km away. Some&#13;
charcoal is also produced in Kaolack but it is destined for local consumption. In some cases&#13;
charcoal production is also authorized on an ad hoc basis in different areas of the country where&#13;
land clearing for agricultural production has taken place.&#13;
3.7.   Until April 1995, when a new Forestry Code was approved (Decret 95-357), the forestry&#13;
legislation gave the Forest Service the exclusive prerogative to assign commercial exploitation&#13;
rights over forest resources nationwide. These rights were historically given only to urban-based&#13;
traders resulting in the creation of a vertically integrated and oligopolistic industry with&#13;
widespread corruption problems. Among other issues, original annual charcoal exploitation&#13;
quotas were frequently surpassed with the Forestry Service lacking the manpower or monitoring&#13;
mechanisms to adequately supervise and enforce them. It is estimated that out of the some 1,800&#13;
legally registered "exploitantsforestiers" only some 20 traders actually work in and control the&#13;
production of charcoal.  The remainder registered traders buy charcoal production licenses&#13;
("quota charbon") and resell them afterwards to the traders that produce charcoal.  That&#13;
secondary -- and illegal -- transaction of those quotas takes place in a well organized black market&#13;
environment that resembles a well functioning stock or futures market. As even the laborers&#13;
"surghas" (Peuls from Guinea) employed in the cutting of the wood and the production of the&#13;
charcoal are brought in to the rural areas by the urban traders, it is estimated that less than 5&#13;
percent of the estimated FCFA 30 billion (US $60 million) annual turnover of the charcoal trade&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
remains in the rural areas. Charcoal is transported to the cities in 15-ton trucks belonging either&#13;
to the same charcoal trader or to private transporters who use the charcoal as return freight. At&#13;
the gateway to the cities, "coxeurs" (wholesalers) regulate the inflows of charcoal by directing&#13;
shipments to retailers. The coxeurs, which are not an officially recognized or regulated group in&#13;
the industry hold a strategic position as they control all distribution in the cities. It is estimated&#13;
that as few as 10 coxeurs control the charcoal flows into the urban markets. The "coxeurs"&#13;
purchase the load from the trader and then sell it on credit to the retailer. A large number of the&#13;
retailers are also Guinean Peuls and are salaried (non-commission) employees of the coxeurs,&#13;
whereby they only derive a small salary from the activity. The points of sale are called "diallo&#13;
kerin. " Figure 3.3 presents the structure of the charcoal labor chain in Senegal. Figure 3.4&#13;
present a typical 15-ton truck used in the transport of charcoal to the urban market.&#13;
Approximately 25 15-ton trucks come into Dakar each day carrying some 375,000 tons of&#13;
charcoal, equivalent to some 2,060 tons of wood.&#13;

3.8.   The commercial extraction of wood products is regulated by a ministerial decree that&#13;
determines the logging season (generally December to August) and the production quotas for&#13;
each region. The charcoal production quotas are based on charcoal outputs and not on wood&#13;
inputs and thus provides no incentive for wood conservation in the carbonization process. The&#13;
regional quotas are distributed among the 'exploilantsforestiers " that have a extraction licenses&#13;
(before the 1993 season, the official order also set reserve quotas allocated at the end of the&#13;
season on the basis of the needs of the urban areas). Based on the quotas, forestry inspection&#13;
officials delineate the authorized logging areas and assign the felling sites to the companies,&#13;
which must register the '"surghas" (employee certification), logging permits contingent upon the&#13;
payment of a forestry tax that are required for all operations, and lastly, transport permits that are&#13;
checked at the control posts on the main highways. Independent of the quotas set by ministerial&#13;
order, additional quantities of wood or charcoal can be sold. These come from operations at&#13;
private plantations or seizures of illegal charcoal made by forestry officials. While considerable&#13;
progress has been made in the last two years in the enforcement of the existing regulations, it is&#13;
necessary to improve the system further.&#13;
3.9.   In general terms the organization of the urban and pern-urban fuelwood trade (520,000&#13;
tons/year) resembles that of the charcoal trade but poses considerably smaller environmental and&#13;
social conflicts as it is based on the collection of dead wood over a much broader geographic&#13;
area. Registered "exploitant foretiers "obtain permits from the forestry Service to collect the&#13;
dead wood in situ and to transport it to the peri-urban and urban markets. Fuelwood is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
transported in a combination of 15 and 30 tons trucks, where the latter are always used for the&#13;
transportation of loads coming in to the markets from distances over 250 kilometers.&#13;
2.     Traditional Energy Prices&#13;
3.10.  Prior to the FCFA devaluation of January 1994, the regulated price of charcoal in the&#13;
urban areas was FCFA 40 per kilogram, however, in practice retailers adjusted the weights and&#13;
sold the charcoal for close to FCFA 60/kg. This situation was tolerated by the Commerce&#13;
authorities because the official price had not changed since February 1986. The price of both&#13;
fuelwood and charcoal were maintained stable by the government for such a long time&#13;
essentially because of the fear that increasing them would generate civil disturbances and&#13;
political unrest. However, after the FCFA devaluation, and the ensuing price increase of most&#13;
basic commodities, made it possible to raise the price of charcoal without encountering major&#13;
consumer resistance. Paradoxically, while average commodity prices increased by 30 percent, the&#13;
price of charcoal was increased from FCFA 40/Kg to FCFA 95/Kg (US $190/ton), equivalent to a&#13;
130 percent increase with respect to the previous official price or then 60 percent compared to the&#13;
real market prices. It is important to note that since the revaluation of the charcoal prices, the&#13;
government has made a point of enforcing the requirement that retailers use scales to weigh&#13;
charcoal sold to customers. As a result of that, the incidence of price/quantity distortions has&#13;
apparently diminished somewhat.&#13;
3.11.  The price increase after the FCFA devaluation has had no positive impact on the rural&#13;
communities. The price increase was expected to be accompanied by a rise in the logging fee&#13;
(forestry tax). However, this measure was only recently adopted and until now the surcharge paid&#13;
by consumers paid after devaluation had disproportionately increased the income of the exploitants&#13;
forestiers and coxeurs vis-a-vis the other actors in the industry. Table 3.3 presents and estimation&#13;
of the structure of the price of charcoal before and after the January 1994 CFA franc devaluation.&#13;
From this table it is possible to observe that after the FCFA devaluation, the profit margin of the&#13;
exploitantsforestiers went up from 6 percent to 25.6 while the share of labor costs decreased from&#13;
21.7 percent to 12.7 percent. In addition to that, while there appears to have been a significant&#13;
increase in the share of the retailers' profit margin (from 8.5% to 19.4%) it is necessary to keep in&#13;
mind that the large majority of the charcoal retailers (diallo kirin) work for coxeurs at a fixed&#13;
salary, hence their real margin is far smaller than the one suggested by the figures in Table 3.3. It is&#13;
estimated that the real margin of the retailers is less than 6 percent, whereby the real margin of the&#13;
wholesalers (coxeurs) is of the order of 17 percent and not 3.5 percent.&#13;
3.12   Current regulated market price of fuelwood is FCFA 40/kg (US $80/ton). Prior to the&#13;
FCFA devaluation the price was FCFA 30/kg. Since the FCFA devaluation and the stricter&#13;
application by authorities of the price/quantity regulations, there is little distortion in real prices&#13;
other that the normal seasonal price variation reflecting relative higher collection and&#13;
transportation costs during the rainy season. The principal component of the fuelwood cost&#13;
structure is transportation (50%), followed by exploitants/wholesalers margins (35%). The&#13;
remainder 15 percent is divided between labor costs, taxation and handling costs. As a large&#13;
proportion of the laborers in the fuelwood trade are also temporary expatriate workers, the&#13;
fuelwood trade currently leaves little or no income in the rural areas.&#13;

3.    Rural Subsistence Supply Systems&#13;
3.13. The consumption of fuelwood in the rural areas (1.5 million tons/year) is largely&#13;
satisfied through geographically dispersed and sustainable subsistence practices (cutting of&#13;
branches, selective felling of small trees and collection of dead branches). Women and children&#13;
play a significant role in the collection of fuelwood. Rural consumption of charcoal is mostly&#13;
limited to the areas where it is produced and is normally traded by the producers for food and&#13;
lodging at the local communities. While rural consumption of woodfuels does not present&#13;
significant environmental or energy supply-demand problems in the immediate future, it is&#13;
necessary to assess the availability and accessibility of dead wood vis-a-vis the spatial dispersion&#13;
of rural populations on a national basis to identify geographic areas of potential future conflict&#13;
and develop pro-active medium-to-long term action programs to prevent them.&#13;
C. EXPECTED FUTURE TRENDS: THE CHARCOAL PROBLEM&#13;
3.14.  A recent survey (June 1994) conducted in Dakar after the FCFA devaluation showed that&#13;
the disproportionate increase in the regulated price of charcoal (100%) with respect to LPG (30%)&#13;
stimulated the substitution of woodfuels by LPG and a general trend toward increased fuel savings.&#13;
As a result, it is estimated that charcoal consumption in Dakar dropped from 150,000 tons in 1993&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
to 130,000 tons in 1994. However, as consumers in secondary cities are rapidly switching from&#13;
wood to charcoal, total charcoal consumption is still on the rise, albeit at an apparently slower rate&#13;
than before.&#13;
3.15.  Charcoal consumption in the cities is growing at just over half the rate of urban&#13;
demographic growth. That trend is expected to continue relatively stable resulting in that total&#13;
urban charcoal consumption would continue to rise at approximately 2% per year, potentially&#13;
reaching some 385,000 tons per year (equivalent to 2.1 million tons of wood) by the year 2000 and&#13;
470,000 tons (or 2.5 million tons of wood) by the year 2010. Under the current non-sustainable&#13;
forest resource exploitation practices these figures would represent an approximate charcoal-related&#13;
deforestation of 35,000 ha in 2000 and of 42,000 in 2010. For the city of Dakar alone, charcoal&#13;
consumption would reach some 150,000 tons in the year 2000 (equivalent to 13,800 ha) and&#13;
185,000 tons in the year 2010 (equivalent to 16,800 ha).&#13;
3.16.  On the other hand, if as a result of rapid economic growth and/or lower than expected&#13;
petroleum prices, the vast majority of urban households were to switch to LPG or kerosene as a&#13;
primary fuel and utilize charcoal as a secondary fuel, charcoal consumption would come down to&#13;
about half the expected level at 2 percent annual growth. In such a case, expected total charcoal&#13;
consumption would come down to some 190,000 tons in the year 2000 and to 230,000 in the year&#13;
2010. Similarly, charcoal consumption in Dakar alone would be some 75,000 tons in 2000 and&#13;
90,000 in 2010, respectively equivalent to a deforestation of approximately 7,000 ha and 8,400 ha.&#13;
3.17.  In simplified terms (assuming non-sustainable exploitation with zero to 40 percent natural&#13;
regrowth), the implication of the above figures is that under the most realistic scenario (2% annual&#13;
growth), is that between now (1997) and the year 2000 total charcoal consumption in Senegal will&#13;
result in an accumulated loss of anywhere from 60,000 ha to 100,000 ha of forest lands, and&#13;
between now and the year 2010 a loss of anywhere from 270,000 ha to 450,000 ha, the later being&#13;
equivalent to one half to two thirds of the total Tambacounda and Kolda forest lands.&#13;
D. SECTORAL ISSUES&#13;
3.18.  Senegal's present and foreseeable macroeconomic and socio-economic conditions&#13;
clearly suggest that the country will continue to depend on forest-based traditional fuels to meet&#13;
the lion's share of its urban and rural energy needs well into the next century. While ongoing&#13;
demand management (improved stoves programs and consumer education campaigns) and inter-&#13;
fuel substitution (LPG and kerosene) efforts need to be continued incorporating the lessons&#13;
learned to date, large increases of petroleum products imports cannot be sustained because of&#13;
budgetary constraints and because current and expected low household income levels severely&#13;
limit the potential for widespread inter-fuel substitution at non-subsidized market prices. Large&#13;
cross-fuel subsidy programs among fuels (like the current LPG subsidy) would imply increased&#13;
production costs and lower competitiveness of Senegal's economy, with wider macroeconomic&#13;
impacts. Within that context, and until widespread economic growth allows for large scale&#13;
substitution to take place, the principal challenge of the energy sector in Senegal will be to&#13;
transform the existing non-sustainable commercial woodfuels supply system into one capable of&#13;
supplying woodfuels -- particularly charcoal -- to the rapidly growing urban population in an&#13;
sustainable manner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
3.19.  Recent World Bank research work in Senegal has concluded that the availability of&#13;
woody biomass in Senegal may have been previously underestimated both in terms of volume of&#13;
stocks and yield potential. Pending confirmation by a proper vegetation cover inventory, it is&#13;
now estimated that, under proper forest management schemes, the existing natural forest stocks&#13;
should be able to sustainably meet most -- if not all -- of the demand for woodfuels for at least&#13;
the next two decades. Implementing sustainable management would imply exploiting the&#13;
existing forest stocks at or below the annual growth (yield) level and would therefore result in&#13;
maintaining the original stocks over time. Yet, as both the government and the private sector&#13;
lack the financial and human resources that would be necessary to adequately manage the&#13;
country's forest resources, sustainable management could only be achieved through the aciv&#13;
involvement of the rural population.  Under the new forestry code, the right regulatory&#13;
framework and the necessary technical assistance and supervision from the Forestry Service&#13;
(MEPN) and other relevant government agencies and NGOs with competencies on land-use and&#13;
rural development issues, the rural population should be able to assume the responsibility for the&#13;
sustainable management of their forest resources. The participation of the rural communities in&#13;
the commercial exploitation of the forest resources for the supply of woodfuels -- particularly&#13;
charcoal -- to the urban markets would result in the creation of significant employment and&#13;
economic development opportunities in the rural areas, with a considerable developmental&#13;
impact for rural women.&#13;
3.20.  The operation of the commercial woodfuels industry (particularly charcoal) has had&#13;
overtime a number of negative environmental and social impacts, such as: the gradual loss of&#13;
forest cover (approx. 30,000 ha/year) and thus of the ecosystem's carbon sequestration&#13;
capacity and biodiversity; the degradation of the rural environment (particularly of the soils);&#13;
the impoverishment of the rural areas; an acceleration of the rural exodus; and a massive transfer&#13;
of wealth from the rural areas to the urban areas. In addition to those negative impacts, it is&#13;
anticipated that within the near-to-medium future the Niokolo-Koba National Park (9,130&#13;
km2), which is an "International Biosphere Reserve Patrimony and Biosphere reserve" located in&#13;
the south-eastern corner of the Tambacounda and Kolda regions, will come under threat of&#13;
encroachment by charcoal exploitation practices. Should this be allowed to happen it would&#13;
have irreparable biodiversity and ecological consequences at the national and global levels. As&#13;
in the case of the management of forest stock, the government lacks the necessary resources --&#13;
and the private sector the interest -- to implement the required environmental protection&#13;
mechanism to safeguard the Niokolo-Koba National Park from that potential encroachment.&#13;
Here again, the responsibilization of the rural communities around the park area could lead to the&#13;
implementation of effective and sustainable biodiverstity protection measures. The combination&#13;
of the community-based forest management activities with the protection of the Niokolo-Koba&#13;
park could be achieved by implementing sustainable and participatory forest management units&#13;
forming a buffer zone around the park area.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
E. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY&#13;
1.    Main Past and Ongoing Programs&#13;
LPG Promotion&#13;
3.21.  In 1974 the Government launched an LPG promotion program intended to curtail the&#13;
rapidly growing consumption of charcoal in the cities. Relatively low single-burner LPG stoves&#13;
were introduced, and the controlled fuel price was set below cost. Under that program, annual&#13;
LPG consumption increased from about 3,500 tons in 1974 to 16,000 tons in 1987, implying an&#13;
average growth rate of 12% per year. In 1987 the Government added further stimulus to&#13;
consumption by reducing the LPG price by about 40%; the result was an acceleration of sales, to&#13;
reach over 50,000 tons in 1994. The annual growth rate in the period 1987-1994 averaged 18%&#13;
per year.&#13;
3.22.  The European Union (EU) provided further support to the government's butanization&#13;
program through a regional butane program (Programme Regional de Gaz - PRG) to the CILSS&#13;
member countries. The financial assistance to Senegal comprised investment in storage facilities&#13;
and money for promotion and consumer education. The funds were channeled through the&#13;
private distributors but, since the retail price was controlled anyway, the end use consumers did&#13;
not benefit and the incremental impact on charcoal use was nil. For various reasons, the PRG&#13;
was no success in other CILSS countries either, and in 1995 the EU formally discontinued the&#13;
Program.&#13;
3.23   Meanwhile, the countries of the CFA zone had to adjust their pricing policies for the&#13;
effect of the 100% currency devaluation in January 1994. The Government of Senegal protected&#13;
LPG consumers by increasing the controlled price by only 30% whereas it allowed an effective&#13;
price increase of domestically produced charcoal by 60%.&#13;
3.24.  Although the different LPG promotion programs have displaced an estimated 90,000&#13;
tons of charcoal per year and, as a result, stabilized charcoal consumption in Dakar at around&#13;
130,000 tons per year, the overall effectiveness has been mixed. The benefit of subsidies has&#13;
been captured only by higher-income urban households and small commercial establishments.&#13;
The annual level of the subsidies reached FCFA 5 billion (or $ 10 million) in 1995. It is argued&#13;
that the subsidy is not a burden on the national treasury because it is financed out of petroleum&#13;
product revenues. However, that implies in inequitable income transfers within the economy&#13;
and, since users of other petroleum products pay for the cross subsidy, it further has promoted a&#13;
distortion of the entire framework of energy prices.&#13;
Dissemination of Improved Stoves&#13;
3.25.  The dissemination of improved fuelwood and charcoal stoves in Senegal began in 1980&#13;
under the responsibility of the CERER, which developed two improved stoves (Ban ak Suuf and&#13;
Sakkanal) with reasonable performance and consumer acceptance. However, by 1987, CERER&#13;
had only been able to disseminate some 30,000 Ban ak Suuf fuelwood stoves in the rural areas&#13;
and less than 10,000 Sakkanal charcoal stoves in the urban areas. Between 1988 and 1994 little&#13;
progress was registered in the promotion of improved stoves. Currently, there are only few&#13;
improved stove projects in operation and they are mostly focused on charcoal. These projects,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
however, are still too small to make a visible impact and/or are largely dependent on donor&#13;
support. It is estimated that only between 5 and 12 percent of Senegalese households have&#13;
improved stoves.&#13;
3.26.  Based on available information, the best program in operation today is the USAID-&#13;
funded Appropriate Technology International (ATI) Diambar charcoal stove program. This&#13;
program supports the production of stoves in Dakar and Thies. The Diambar stove, which&#13;
consists of a ceramic interior covered in sheet metal, is proving to be very efficient (30-40%)&#13;
under normal household use conditions and has a high consumer acceptability. A wider&#13;
dissemination of this promising stove, however, has been limited by availability of investment&#13;
credit to the small artisans who produce the ceramic and the metal shell. Current sales of&#13;
Diambar stoves are reported at 20,000 per year at prices that vary from 2,000 FCFA to 4,500&#13;
FCFA depending on the size. At the estimated 30-40 percent efficiency range, a wider&#13;
dissemination of the Diambar stove could result in a significant reduction in charcoal&#13;
consumption and expeditures at the household level.&#13;
3.27.  Other urban-based improved charcoal stove projects include the PAMEC project (metal&#13;
and leather artisans project) from MEMI's Directorate of Artisanat which support artisans in&#13;
Thies, Kaolack, Saint Louis and Louga; the ENDA-Graf which assists metal artisans in Dakar&#13;
and Rufisque; and different small stove-related women's groups support activities by the&#13;
Ministry of Women, Children and the Family.&#13;
3.28.  While many reasons have been offered for the limited success of most improved stoves&#13;
program in West Africa, recent work suggests that too much emphasis was given to technical&#13;
performance (energy efficiency) and too little to consumer acceptability. The majority of the&#13;
sociological field work undertaken did not have research objectives but rather was intended to&#13;
convince consumers to utilize improved stoves through "sensibilization campaigns". With few&#13;
exceptions consumers consistently were unable to perceive the benefit of improved stoves and&#13;
penetration remained a function of direct donor-financed promotion efforts. As soon as donor&#13;
financing was cut penetration stopped and households did not replace stoves when the time came&#13;
to do so. The sociological studies were used to influence the technical design of stoves (pot size&#13;
capability, type of food cooked, etc.) but not necessarily to design the stove's social&#13;
marketability. As a result even highly performing stoves under laboratory conditions lacked the&#13;
necessary consumer attractiveness (quality of material, presentation, marketing approach, etc.) to&#13;
generate commercial success stories. At the same time, while it was expected that consumers&#13;
would perceived the economic advantage of utilizing improved stoves, market price/quantity&#13;
distortions and speculation (the practice to sell presumable kilogram units with as little as 700&#13;
grams of actual weight) rapidly eroded the expected saving because fuelwood and charcoal are&#13;
not traded on the basis of standardized units but of money (i.e., 50 FCFA or 10 FCFA of&#13;
charcoal). As the non-regulated fuel units shrank through time by up to 30% there went with it&#13;
the possibility for consumers to perceive any concrete saving.&#13;
Forestry Projects&#13;
3.29.  Many aforestation projects have been carried out in Senegal the course of the last decade&#13;
to increase forest resources. At present, 30 programs are under way. The approach of these&#13;
projects was long dominated by reforestation on force account. This had only a limited impact&#13;
because of the high cost (US $500 - US $750 per hectare) relative to the benefits, the difficulty&#13;
of protecting the forestry stands against over-exploitation and the lack of participation of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
rural communities. Recent years have seen a gradual shift from reforestation operations on force&#13;
account to a more communitarian approach and with the integration of agro-sylvo-pastoral&#13;
activities. Today, a large number of those projects focus on rural forestry and half of them&#13;
include some training, information dissemination and education activities. By now some&#13;
150,000 ha. have been replanted since 1970. Despite the importance of the progress made, the&#13;
current reforestation rate (close to 20,000 ha/year) is still well below that of deforestation and&#13;
over the short-to-medium term the new plantations will not to play a significant role in the&#13;
supply of wood products (charcoal included).&#13;
Improvement of Carbonization Techniques&#13;
3.30.  A program to train charcoal makers in the use of improved kilns (the "Casamance" kiln)&#13;
was undertaken between 1980 and 1986. The program trained more than 7,500 charcoal&#13;
workers. For a relatively small investment (about FCFA 20,000), the kiln boosts the&#13;
carbonization yield by 20%. Nevertheless, the program was discontinued because successive&#13;
evaluations showed that the charcoal laborers ("surghas ") continued to use their traditional&#13;
carbonization methods in stead of the improved kilns. The principal reasons for this was the&#13;
"surghas" complete dependence on the commercial charcoal traders ("exploitants forestiers"),&#13;
who had no incentive to investment in kilns or to pay the additional cost to transport them into&#13;
the charcoal production sites. As charcoal production quotas were set on the basis of charcoal&#13;
quantities and not on the basis of areas or wood volumes, any additional production cost would&#13;
only reduced the trader's profit margins.&#13;
3.31.  As the new wood volume-based charcoal quota system comes into effect in 1997, it is&#13;
expected that traders will have a clear incentive to utilize improved kilns, as doing so would&#13;
maximize their revenues for the same level of effort and forest resources. While the traders&#13;
could be expected to upgrade their carbonization practices within the next 2 to 3 years, all&#13;
community-based charcoal production promoted by the proposed project will based on improved&#13;
technology. The use of improved carbonization methods will be monitored throughout the&#13;
proposed project and the economic and financial information obtained in the first three years of&#13;
the project will be used for the elaboration of a new woodfuels pricing and fiscal policy due to be&#13;
enacted by the government by December 2000 (para. 6.9.iii). The operation, monitoring and&#13;
enforcement mechanisms for the production of charcoal by the rural communities will be&#13;
stipulated within the "contract plans" (para.5.4.vii) that will be established between the&#13;
government and the participating communities. The overall enforcement of the charcoal related&#13;
regulatory and policy changes will be the responsibility of the Forestry Service. The Forestry&#13;
Service will act on the basis of the monitoring and supervision systems that will be implemented&#13;
by the project (forest resources exploitation, woodfuels trade flows and community&#13;
participation).&#13;
2.    Future Strategy&#13;
3.32.  In order to address the existing problems and contribute towards the effective&#13;
development of the traditional and household energy sectors in Senegal it will be necessary to&#13;
undertake a well focused set of priority actions. It is obvious that numerous other things can and&#13;
perhaps should be done to some degree, however, the limitation of human and investment&#13;
resources imposes the need to retain focus over a small core group of complementary priority&#13;
actions:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
Institutional Issues and Options&#13;
*  to strengthen the existing sectoral institutions (primarily the Direction des Eaux et&#13;
Forets and Direction de l'Energie) and to upgrade their staff and means to plan,&#13;
coordinate, monitor and evaluate sectoral activities and measures; and&#13;
*  to elaborate and implement a sound communication strategy capable of maintaining&#13;
the entire population (government agencies and civil society at large) informed of&#13;
the developments in the sector, to lay the ground for necessary policy reform work&#13;
(changes in pricing, charcoal quotas, taxation, forestry codes, forestry application&#13;
decrees, land and tree tenure, etc.) and to effectively promote the different demand&#13;
management measures and inter-fuel substitution fuels or equipment (improved&#13;
stoves, gas, kerosene, etc.).&#13;
Traditional Energy Markets&#13;
*  implement large scale community-based sustainable forest management systems&#13;
capable of spatially fixing production of woodfuels for the rapidly growing urban&#13;
markets (particularly charcoal) and promoting integrated natural resource&#13;
management and biodiversity protection. In order to do this the following activities&#13;
would have to be undertaken: a comprehensive inventory of forestry and other&#13;
biomass resources, in conjunction with a survey of land use; participatory rural&#13;
appraisals in target communities to ensure their participation in the proposed&#13;
sustainable management plans;  and make the necessary adjustments in the&#13;
regulatory framework so as to create the right regulatory environment (land and tree&#13;
tenure, taxation, revenues, etc.);&#13;
-  promote the implementation of rural community-run improved charcoal kilns&#13;
(Casamance kilns) at concentrated fixed locations in order to increase the efficiency&#13;
of the charcoal carbonization and spatially organize its production; and&#13;
-  support the economic diversification (including commercial timber plantations,&#13;
urban and rural retail activities, LPG distribution, etc.) of the existing exploitants&#13;
forestiers to reduce the potential conflicts of the gradual transfer of an important&#13;
part of the industry and revenues to the rural communities.&#13;
Regulatory and Policy Issues and Options&#13;
*  enact the necessary legislation to replace charcoal quotas in the areas under&#13;
community management by sustainable annual production ceilings fixed by the&#13;
management plan agreed between the government and the communities and, as a&#13;
transitional measures, to ensure that the immediate vicinity of the villages in non-&#13;
managed zones should be protected from indiscriminate cutting by an exclusion zone&#13;
(e.g. a radius of several km);&#13;
* enact the application decree for setting-up of the Niokolo-Koba protection buffer&#13;
zone;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
*  change the charcoal royalty system from its present charcoal output base to a wood&#13;
input base in order to promote increase carbonization efficiency.&#13;
*  review  and simplify the current woodfuels regulatory systems to reduce its&#13;
enforcement burden and to reduce the opportunities for process corruption; and&#13;
*  establish a modem and strengthened system for monitoring and controlling forestry&#13;
exploitation and flows of woodfuels, in order to ensure compliance with the forestry&#13;
management plans, provide reliable data on a regular basis, increase forestry revenue&#13;
and ensure the protection of the forest stocks and of biodiversity.&#13;
Energy Demand Management&#13;
*  introduce standard weights and measures and improved charcoal handling (including&#13;
the introduction of standardized bagging of charcoal at the retail level) in order to&#13;
protect consumers from price/quantity speculation by retailers and to reduction of&#13;
urban pollution;&#13;
-  remove all controls on charcoal retail prices as soon as enforceable standard weights&#13;
have been established and more competition has been introduced;&#13;
-  promote the production and marketing of improved charcoal stoves in the urban&#13;
center by the private sector and/or NGO community at non-subsidized market prices;&#13;
and&#13;
*  promote the use of improved stoves in the urban households through appropriate&#13;
sensibilization and consumer information campaigns;&#13;
Inter-fuel Substitution Options&#13;
*  review the procurement, storage and handling systems of the LPG and Kerosene in&#13;
Senegal, with a view to identify the areas and issues which can be improve (cost,&#13;
efficiency, transparency, and performance) in order to reduce either the need for&#13;
governmental subsidies or their final retail prices;&#13;
*  continue to support the dissemination of LPG by the private sector nationwide,&#13;
through the standardization of retail prices ("perequation"), limited financial support&#13;
to private sector entrepreneurs for the construction of decentralized depots and&#13;
suitable promotion operations; and&#13;
*  explore the potential of kerosene as a substitute fuel for the secondary cities of the&#13;
country where the consumption of charcoal is increasing rapidly.&#13;

IV.   BANK GROUP/GEF ROLE IN THE TRADITIONAL ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
A. HISTORY AND LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREvIOuS BANK/IDA/GEF INVOLVEMENT&#13;
4.1.   The proposed project incorporates the principal lessons learned over the past two&#13;
decades in "household" energy and participatory natural resource management interventions in&#13;
West Africa, including projects in Burkina Faso, Gambia, Mali and Niger. The lessons&#13;
incorporated include but are not limited to the need to:&#13;
(i)  focus the priority for action in the traditional energy/household energy sector on&#13;
the establishment of sustainable woodfuels supply systems capable of satisfying&#13;
the growing and concentrated urban markets;&#13;
(ii) enact a legal and regulatory framework that provides for the effective transfer of&#13;
the control over natural resources from the Government to the rural populations;&#13;
(iii) implement a simplified traditional and household fuels fiscal and pricing&#13;
regulatory framework which avoids loopholes and opportunities for market&#13;
distortions and "corruption";&#13;
(iv) follow a natural resource and rural development approach to the implementation of&#13;
community managed woodfuels supply schemes to ensure the materialization and&#13;
sustainability of social and economic development under the project;&#13;
(v) re-orient the role of governmental agencies towards policy formulation activities&#13;
and away from actual project execution, and promote an increased participation of&#13;
civil society (community, NGOs and private sector) in the implementation of non-&#13;
subsidized project activities (inter-fuel substitution, improved stoves, etc.); and&#13;
(vi) promote and maintain ample consultation/ participation of all the "stakeholders"&#13;
throughout the entire policy-project cycle, and implement a sound communication&#13;
strategy.&#13;
B. RATIONALE FOR BANK/GEF FINANCING AND CONSISTENCY WITH THE COUNTRY&#13;
ASSISTANCE STRATEGY&#13;
4.2.   The project is a logical progression of the new traditional energy sector development&#13;
strategy developed with the Bank's assistance (RPTES Program) and is fully consistent with the&#13;
agreed Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) of February 16, 1995. Its implementation would&#13;
result in advancements in key areas of the Bank's development assistance agenda for Senegal,&#13;
including -- but not limited to -- the rationalization and stabilization of the energy sector,&#13;
promotion of sustainable forest and natural resource management practices, creation of&#13;
participatory and gender-balanced rural development opportunities, private sector development,&#13;
NGO community participation and reduction of environmental degradation. Further, the project&#13;
would be fully consistent with the principles and recommendations of Agenda 21, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
Convention to Combat Desertification (CCD), the United Nations Framework Convention on&#13;
Climate Change (UNFCCC), and the Beijing Declaration.&#13;
4.3.   While the current institutional and policy environments of the forestry and energy&#13;
sectors in Senegal justify Bank involvement and support, up until recently both sectors were&#13;
plagued by serious problems, the least of which was a strong interference by political and&#13;
economic interest groups in policy and institutional matters and even in daily operational issues&#13;
within in the sector. Those problems, exacerbated by serious incidents like the clear-cutting of&#13;
the Mbegue forest in 1992, led to the suspension of a Bank forestry sector project in 1992&#13;
(PICOGERNA) and to the refusal by the Bank and other donors to finance investment proposals&#13;
presented by the GoS at an Energy Donors Round Table in 1992. Nevertheless, as in other&#13;
Africa countries, Senegal has experienced a considerable process of political and institutional&#13;
change in the last three years as a direct result of the ongoing push towards democratization and&#13;
administrative decentralization. Whereas some time will still be required for Senegal to put that&#13;
negative past behind, there is today a clear awareness in government that a repetition of incidents&#13;
such as the clear-cutting of the Mbegue forest would result on seriously destabilizing internal&#13;
and external political and economic repercussions.&#13;
4.4.   Clearly marking the changes that have taken place in Senegal in the recent past, the new&#13;
forestry code expressly provides for the transfer of responsibility from the Government to the&#13;
rural communities for the sustainable management and exploitation of the existing natural forest&#13;
resources, and establishes that all forest resources exploitation activities must now be consulted&#13;
with and approved by the affected rural communities. This fundamental regulatory change --&#13;
which would have been unthinkable a decade ago -- is fully consistent with the overall trend&#13;
toward administrative decentralization and has the full commitment of the Government at the&#13;
ministerial and technical levels. Nevertheless, the still powerful -- although rapidly diminishing&#13;
-- charcoal oligopoly that exists cannot and should not be dismantled overnight. An organized&#13;
process of gradual transition and increasing participation of the rural populations in the&#13;
woodfuels industry trade will be necessary in order to avoid sudden woodfuels market ruptures,&#13;
and the negative energy, social and political consequences that would result from them. Such a&#13;
gradual process is also necessary from environmental and energy efficiency points of view, as&#13;
the rural population will need some time to assimilate both sustainable forest management and&#13;
efficient carbonization practices and methods. Not allowing for such a gradual transition would&#13;
result in low natural resource sustainability, decreased carbonization efficiencies and potential&#13;
social and economic conflicts from the redistribution of part of the industry's income to the rural&#13;
communities.&#13;
4.5.   The sustainable woodfuels supply management component qualifies for GEF support&#13;
under the short term projects window of the operational strategy for climate change. The&#13;
component is a country sustainable development and global environment priority, likely to&#13;
succeed. It is also highly cost effective in the short term (US $ 4.30/t CO2 after 7 years and US $&#13;
1.04/t CO2 after 15 years). Its objective is carbon sequestration, which the strategy flags as a&#13;
possible future operational program and on which early experience is sought. The participation&#13;
of GEF in the project is necessary in order to assist the GoS in the financing of community-&#13;
participatory activities ("mesures incitatives ") and monitoring and evaluation systems designed&#13;
to generate and/or guarantee the materialization of incremental global environmental benefits&#13;
(climate change and biodiversity agendas). Through the implementation of sustainable forest&#13;
resources management systems, the project will provide -- within the project area and dimension&#13;
- for the production of 300,000 tons/year of fuelwood with a zero net emission effect, thus&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
significantly reducing ongoing CO2 emissions. In addition, the project would establish a buffer&#13;
zone around the Niokolo-Koba National Park, increasing the protection to biodiversity.&#13;
Without GEF financing the GoS will lack the necessary funding to cover the proposed activities&#13;
and thus the global environmental benefits would not be realized. In addition to the above, a&#13;
highly cost effective improved charcoal stoves program activity (unit abatement cost of US&#13;
$0.34/t CO2 after 7 years) will be included within project's Demand Management component.&#13;
While this activity will n= be financed by GEF its implementation is fully consistent with GEF's&#13;
operational program for removing barriers to energy conservation and energy efficiency. The&#13;
barriers in this case are shortage of up-front capital and lack of knowledge. Annex 1 presents a&#13;

V.    THE PROJECT&#13;
5.1.   Background.  The proposed project was prepared by the GoS with assistance from the&#13;
Bank's Africa Regional Program "Review of Policies in the Traditional Energy Sector -&#13;
RPTES". Through the RPTES a national inter-ministerial team conducted between mid 1993&#13;
and late 1994, a comprehensive review of the traditional energy sector in Senegal, including the&#13;
evaluation of the principal inter-fuel substitution issues and options (kerosene and LPG).&#13;
Within that review, the regulatory, legal, pricing and fiscal frameworks of the sector and the&#13;
evolution of its structure and functioning were studied in detail. The inter-ministerial RPTES&#13;
team was led by the Directorate of Energy of the Ministry of Energy, Mining, and Industry&#13;
(MEMI) and was integrated by other senior staff from the Directorate for Water and Forests of&#13;
the Ministry of the Environment and Protection of Nature (MEPN), Ministry of Commerce,&#13;
Ministry of Women Affairs, Ministry of Finance and Plan, and inter alia, the National CILSS&#13;
Commission (CONACILSS), which are all members of the "Cellule de Combustibles&#13;
Domestiques". By May 1995 the five RPTES participating countries presented their respective&#13;
policy conclusions and recommendations and a draft of investment project at the "RPTES Donor&#13;
Experts' Conference" at Maastricht, The Netherlands. After the Maastricht conference, the&#13;
Senegal RPTES team went to work on the polishing of their proposed sectoral investment&#13;
program based on the comments received from the several donor present. The basic project draft&#13;
design was extensively discussed among different government agencies, the NGO community&#13;
and several beneficiary consultation and participation activities have and will be done through-&#13;
out project implementation (see section Beneficiary Participation and Consultation).&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
5.2.   Project Objectives.   The objective of the project is to meet an important part of the&#13;
rapidly growing urban demand for household fuels, without the loss of forest cover and the&#13;
ecosystem's carbon sequestration potential and biodiversity. This objective would be met&#13;
through:&#13;
(i)  the implementation and monitoring of 300,000 hectares of environmentally&#13;
sustainable community-managed forest resource systems in the Tambacounda and&#13;
Kolda regions of Senegal, creating a protection zone around the Niokolo-Koba&#13;
National Park (Biosphere Reserve);&#13;
(ii) the promotion of private sector inter-fuel substitution and private sector and NGO-&#13;
based improved stoves initiatives; and&#13;
(iii) the strengthening of the institutions involved in the management of the sector, and&#13;
the promotion of the participation of the civil society (private sector, academic&#13;
institutions, and NGOs community) in the operation of the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
5.3.    Project Description.  The project consists of three components: (i) Preparatory and&#13;
Support Activities component; (ii) Sustainable Woodfuels Supply Management component;&#13;
and, (iii) Demand Management and Inter-fuel Substitution Options component.   The&#13;
project design includes a series of activities to ensure an effective participation of the rural&#13;
population ("measures incitatives") and thus guarantee the full achievement of the&#13;
environmental sustainability objective of the project.  The project also includes specific&#13;
monitoring and evaluation activities (forest exploitation and wildlife) designed to evaluate the&#13;
achievement of its global environmental objectives (maintenance of carbon sequestration&#13;
capacity, CO2 emission abatement and biodiversity conservation:&#13;
5.4.   Component I: The Preparatory and Support Activities component would have an&#13;
approximate duration of one calendar year and would finance technical assistance, equipment&#13;
and operational costs to carry out:&#13;
(i)   A comprehensive assessment of vegetation cover in the Tambacounda and Kolda&#13;
regions to generate the technical data necessary to design sound community-level&#13;
sustainable forest management plans and to select the specific geographical areas&#13;
to be covered by the project;&#13;
(ii) A series of participatorv rural appraisals to obtain the demographic, socio-&#13;
economic, and cultural information necessary to prepare, with the local&#13;
communities, the specific management plans. These Parse would pay special&#13;
attention to the identification of relevant women's development issues, specific&#13;
training and capacity building needs;&#13;
(iii) The design of monitoring and evaluation systems including: (a) a forest resources&#13;
exploitation monitoring system for the Tambacounda and Kolda regions to&#13;
evaluate the sustainability achieved by the community-managed systems and to&#13;
supervise the operation of the non-community based woodfuels traders and their&#13;
compliance with authorized exploitation plans; (b) a forest fire monitoring and&#13;
response system for the community-managed areas to assist in the reduction of&#13;
forest resource losses within the project area;  (c) a rural community-based&#13;
wildlife monitoring system to evaluate the compliance with and achievement of&#13;
the project's biodiversity objective; (d) a national woodfuels trade flows&#13;
monitoring system to enable the correct quantification of the market requirements&#13;
and the preparation of long-term woodfuels supply strategies at the national level;&#13;
(e) kerosene and LPG penetration monitoring systems; and (f) urban improved&#13;
stoves penetration monitoring system.&#13;
(iv) The elaboration of capacity building and training programs, with special emphasis&#13;
on the training and extension needs of the regional Forest Services offices,&#13;
community groups and NGOs;&#13;
(v)  Institutional development and capacity building  support to the different&#13;
govemmental agencies, community associations and NGOs that will participate in&#13;
the implementation of the project, with special emphasis in the training and&#13;
"recycling" of the Forest Service staff who will be directly responsible for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
implementation of the Sustainable Woodfuels Supply Management component and&#13;
the staff of the Energy Directorate (MEMI);&#13;
(vi) Elaboration of technical studies and assessments on demand management and&#13;
interfuel substitution issues (kerosene stoves and penetrations strategies, improved&#13;
charcoal stoves, energy pricing, etc.);&#13;
(vii) The preparation of a detailed implementation plan for the annual participatory&#13;
forest management modules, including the preparation of standard Government-&#13;
rural community "Contract Plans";&#13;
(viii) The preparation of a detailed implementation plan for the Demand Management&#13;
and Inter-fuel Substitution Options Component, including the selection of the&#13;
private sector and NGO initiatives to be supported by the project; and&#13;
(ix) The design of a comprehensive project implementation communication strategy to&#13;
promote increased participation of civil society (community, NGOs and private&#13;
sector) in the management and operation of the sector.&#13;
5.5.   Component II:  The Sustainable Woodfuels Supply Management component would&#13;
finance technical assistance, small tools and field equipment for the rural communities, vehicles&#13;
and office and field equipment for the Forest Service (regional offices), forest fire control&#13;
equipment, and community projects (carbonization units, agro-forestry enterprises, etc. (micro-&#13;
realisations communitaires) to carry out:&#13;
(i)  The implementation of sustainable community-managed forest management&#13;
systems over and area of 300,000 ha within a total period of six years, from which&#13;
woodfuels would be produced. The project would seek to reinforce the buffer&#13;
zone around the Niokolo-Koba National Park (international "Biosphere&#13;
Reserve"). This component would implement annually increasing "forest/natural&#13;
resource management modules", starting at 15,000 ha in the second year up to&#13;
100,000 ha in the seventh year;&#13;
(ii)  An assessment of the availability of and access to woodfuels for rural subsistence&#13;
consumption at the national scale, paying particular attention to the availability of&#13;
dead wood vis-a-vis the geographic dispersion of the rural population;&#13;
(iii) Technical support and extension services to the participating rural communities&#13;
and NGOs for the implementation of the participatory management modules and&#13;
for the exploitation/production and marketing of woodfuels and other potential&#13;
wood and non-wood products;&#13;
(iv) Support for the establishment of rural-based micro-enterprises, such as&#13;
community-operated carbonization units, agro-forestry processing units, etc.; and&#13;
(v)  The implementation of a comprehensive communication strategy in support of the&#13;
implementation of the Sustainable Woodfuels Supply Management component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
5.6.   Component III:  The Demand Management and Inter-fuel Substitution Options&#13;
component would finance technical assistance, vehicles and office equipment for the Direction&#13;
de I 'Energie, purchase of 1,000 kerosene stoves for a pilot program; purchase of LPG bottles and&#13;
burners to carry out:&#13;
(i)  Support for the re-organization and modernization of the urban charcoal trade to&#13;
establish long-term supply agreements (contracts) between rural communities and&#13;
urban traders -- to guarantee the unconstrained entry of community-produced&#13;
woodfuels to the urban markets -- and to permit the standardization of the&#13;
marketing units and the cleaning of the urban environment (charcoal bagging);&#13;
(ii)  Providing technical assistance and limited financial support for the economic&#13;
diversification of existing urban charcoal traders ("exploitants forestiers").&#13;
Proposal received include enterprise diversification into LPG retail, gas service&#13;
stations, foodstuffs retail and light transport activities. The financial support to be&#13;
provided by the project would be limited to organizational and training activities;&#13;
(iii) The execution of specific technical and market-feasibility studies to support the&#13;
further promotion of LPG and Kerosene as substitute household fuels (the&#13;
kerosene study will complement a proposed GTZ-funded study within the recently&#13;
launched German-Senegalese Household Energy Assistance Project); and&#13;
(iv) Providing support for the continuation of inter-fuel substitution options (kerosene&#13;
and LPG) and dissemination of improved stoves by the private sector and NGOs.&#13;
C. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
5.7.   Project Cost and Financing.  The total project cost is estimated at US $19.9 million,&#13;
with a foreign exchange component of about US $18.7 million (94%). The financing plan&#13;
includes US $1.2 million from GoS (para. 7.1.iii), US $5.2 million from IDA, US $4.7 million&#13;
from GEF, and US $8.8 million to cofinanced by the Dutch Government. The GEF Council has&#13;
already approved the request for funding for the project (US $4.7 million) (para. 7.2.i). The&#13;
GEF funding includes US $500,000 from the Danish Environmental Program. It is important to&#13;
note that, as outlined above, the financing plan does not include the large in-kind financing from&#13;
the rural communities (sustainable forest management) and NGOs (community support and&#13;
improved stoves activities), nor the investments that are expected from the promotion of private&#13;
sector activities (modernization of the charcoal filiere and inter-fuel substitution).&#13;
5.8.   GEF Incremental Costs.  The incremental cost of the "GEF Alternative scenario" is&#13;
US $4.66 million. This represents the cost for the implementation of activities within the&#13;
Preparatory and Support Activities and the Sustainable Woodfuels Supply Management&#13;
components related to community-participation, integrated natural resources management,&#13;
institutional development and the monitoring and evaluation of global environmental benefits.&#13;
5.9.  It is estimated that over the project duration of 7 years the GEF Alternative Scenario&#13;
would achieve a total CO2 emission abatement of 1.1 million tons at an incremental cost of&#13;
US $4.30/ t C02- Over 15 years, the GEF Alternative scenario would result in a C02 emission&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
abatement of 4.5 million tons at an incremental cost of US $1.041t CO2 (see Annex 3 for a&#13;
detailed calculation of the project's Incremental Cost and Global Benefits).&#13;
D. BENEFICIARY CONSULTATION AND PARTICIPATION&#13;
5.10. The sectoral development strategy and investment proposals prepared by the GoS were&#13;
widely discussed at all levels of Government and with the civil society, including the private and&#13;
academic sectors and the NGO community, during national participatory seminars and&#13;
workshops. A special national workshop for "exploitants forestiers" was held in 1994 and&#13;
periodic consultations were sustained since with key sector entrepreneurs to ensure their support&#13;
for the implementation of the envisaged policies and investments. Three regional workshops&#13;
(including delegations from Burkina Faso, Gambia, Niger, Mali &amp; Senegal) were held to&#13;
promote a regional discussion of country policy findings and investment proposals and cross-&#13;
country comparisons and to allow for a direct exchange of experiences. Table 5.1 presents a&#13;
summary of the participation plan for the proposed project (para. 7.1.iii). Annex 4 presents a&#13;
descriptive summary of the project's participation action plan.&#13;
5.11. In December 1995 three "Project Design Workshops" (Government agencies, NGOs &amp;&#13;
private sector and donor community) were held in Dakar to further review the proposed project's&#13;
design concept. A large NGO community consultation meeting was held in Dakar in late March,&#13;
1996 to prepare a series of direct beneficiary (rural community) consultation workshops which&#13;
took place in April 1996.&#13;
5.12.  Because of the nature of the proposed project, its participation and beneficiary&#13;
consultation aspects are of critical importance. The participation activities that would be&#13;
undertaken within the project have as main objective assuring that the implementation of the&#13;
project will be based on beneficiary representative participation (para. 7.1 .ii).&#13;
E. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
5.13. The Ministry of Environment and Protection of Nature (MEPT) and the Ministry of&#13;
Energy, Mines and Industry (MEMI) through the appointment of a National Project Director&#13;
(NPD) and the establishment of a Project Coordination Unit (PCU) would be jointly&#13;
responsible for the overall implementation of the project (para. 7.2.ii). The implementation of&#13;
the Preparatory and Support Activities component would be under the joint responsibility of&#13;
MEPT and MEMI as this component includes preparatory activities related to areas of&#13;
competence of both ministries. The National Water and Forest Directorate (NWFD/MEPT)&#13;
alone would be responsible for the implementation of the Sustainable Woodfuels Supply&#13;
Management component of the project. The Energy Directorate (DE/MIME) would be&#13;
responsible for the implementation of the Demand Management and Inter-fuel Substitution&#13;
Options component. The existing "Cellule de combustibles domestiques" would serve as a&#13;
"consultative group" for the project and would provide the institutional conduit for multi-agency&#13;
coordination. Moreover, a small formal high-level "Steering Committee" for the project will be&#13;
set-up to oversee the implementation of the project and provide guidance on important issue that&#13;
arise. This Steering Committee will be formed by senior representatives of the Borrower, the&#13;
project's donor agencies and, possibly, representatives of the civil society.&#13;
&#13;

Table 5.1: Summary of proposed Participation Action Plan (PAP)&#13;
Key Elements of the Plan&#13;
*  Based on a Consultative and Participatory Process: The design of this plan resulted from a&#13;
consultative process of Policy Formulation and Project Identification involving several key stakeholders.&#13;
In addition, a series of National and Regional Participatory Project Preparation Workshops were&#13;
conducted by the Government of Senegal between December 1995 and April 1996 to obtain feedback and&#13;
suggestions from representatives of civil society on the overall project strategy.&#13;
* NGO Oversight: The Government of Senegal will choose an NGO to be responsible for the monitoring&#13;
of the SPEMP-PAP. This "lead" NGO will be responsible for promoting, monitoring and reporting on all&#13;
participatory activities during the project implementation phase.&#13;
*  Phase of Preparatory and Support Activities: The first 12-18 months of the project will be dedicated to&#13;
participatory preparation activities, as well as other support activities. The participatory preparation&#13;
activities will allow communities to design their own community management plans as well as for the&#13;
project team to obtain additional social, economic, ecological, and functional information necessary for&#13;
project implementation. Once the actual implementation of the sustainable woodfuels management&#13;
systems begins, additional PRAs will be conducted in the rural communities that are expected to join the&#13;
project in the subsequent year.&#13;
*  Role of Women, Youth and NGOs4: Due to their critical role in resource management and development,&#13;
women, youth and NGOs have been identified as key participants and will play a fundamental role&#13;
throughout the life cycle of the project.&#13;
*  Participatory Methodology Training for Government Officials: General sensitizing of government&#13;
decision makers on participatory approaches and their impact on development is planned as a key&#13;
component of capacity building and institutional development activities for the Government of Senegal.&#13;
5.14   The project includes a Preparatory and Support Activities components which entails the&#13;
detailed design and preparation of all major project investment components. As such, the&#13;
Preparatory and Support Activities component is intended to serve like a "project preparation&#13;
facility (PPF)". A PPF was not considered for this project because of the relatively small size of&#13;
the overall operation did not warrant the establishment of a PPF. Rather, an initial component&#13;
through which design issues would be finalized and which would constitute _ condition of&#13;
disbursement for the investment activities of the two additional components (supply and&#13;
Demand) (para. 7.3). Table 5.2 presents an implementation calendar for the SPEMP project.&#13;
The implementation of the project -- and in particular the preparatory and support services&#13;
component -- will make full use of the accumulated Bank and non-Bank experience accumulated&#13;
thus far in the sub-region in similar forest/natural resources management projects. Among Bank&#13;
projects, the SPEMP activities will closely review: (i) Burkina Faso: Programme National de&#13;
Gestion Terroir (PNGT); (ii) Niger: Energy II; (iii) Mali: Household Energy Project (HEP); and&#13;
Mali: Programme de Gestion des Resources Naturelles (PGRN). Other non-Bank projects to be&#13;
4Non-Governmental Organizations here also refers to Community Based Organizations&#13;
(CBOs)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
studies, include: (i) Burkina Faso (UNDP/FAO): Programme National de Amenagement&#13;
Forestiers (PNAF); (ii) Senegal (Dutch Cooperation): Previnova; and (iii) Gambia (GTZ):&#13;
Forestry Project.&#13;
1. Component I: The Preparatory and Support Activities&#13;
5.15   The assessment of vegetation cover in the Tambacounda and Kolda regions will be&#13;
undertaken by the Inventory and Cartography Division of the Forestry Service with support from&#13;
the Centre de Suivi Ecologique (CSE) and of specialized consultant assistance. An initial review&#13;
of the different methodologies that have already been used in Senegal to undertake forest and&#13;
vegetation cover inventories will be made. On the basis of that, one methodology will be chosen&#13;
or design to undertake the intended vegetation cover assessment. It is envisaged that the chosen&#13;
methodology will be later adopted as the standardized methodology for subsequent&#13;
forest/vegetation cover inventories and assessments in Senegal. The reason for conducting a&#13;
vegetatimn assessment as opposed to a narrower forest resource assessment is to obtain the&#13;
information necessary to design the community-based natural resource management strategies&#13;
and plans envisaged by the project (forest, agriculture, herding, extraction, etc.).&#13;
5.16   The participatorv rural appraisals constitute the principal participatory activity of the&#13;
preparatory and Support Activities Component and are expected to provide the basis for the&#13;
identification and selection of the rural communities to be included in the project. The execution&#13;
of the PRAs will be done by locally active NGO groups under the supervision of the regional&#13;
Forestry Service agencies. The base methodology for the PRAs will be prepared by the Forestry&#13;
Service of the PCU with assistance of specialized consultants as required (individuals and/or&#13;
NGOs). The resulting methodology will be subject to specific IDA approval. The first batch of&#13;
PRAs should be completed by the end of the first year of project implementation. As conditions&#13;
in the rural communities are expected to change over time, only a limited number of PRAs will&#13;
be conducted during the Preparatory and Support Activities Component (approximately 40&#13;
PRAs). The remaining PRAs will be undertaken in years 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the project&#13;
implementation schedule. The initial 40 PRAs however are expected to provide the necessary&#13;
input to design "standard" participatory and sustainable forest management modules.&#13;
5.17   The design of monitoring and evaluation systems (forest resources exploitation; forest&#13;
fire; wildlife; national woodfuels trade flows, kerosene and LPG penetration; and improved&#13;
stoves) will be done by specialized consultants (individuals, private firms and/or NGO) under the&#13;
supervision of the PCU. This activity should be completed by the end of the first year of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
5.18   The elaboration of capacity building and training programs and the preparation of a&#13;
detailed implementation plan for the annual participatory forest management modules (including&#13;
the Government-rural community "Contract Plans") will be done by the Forestry Service&#13;
with support from specialized consultants and technical assistance groups. Among other, it is&#13;
envisaged that FAO will play a role in the development and implementation of the intended&#13;
capacity development and training programs as a cooperation agency. This activity should be&#13;
completed within the first 18 months of project implementation.&#13;

5.19   The preparation of a detailed implementation plan for the annual participatory and&#13;
sustainable forest management modules (including the preparation of standard Govemment-rural&#13;
community "Contract Plans ") will be done by the Forestry Service with support from&#13;
specialized consultants and technical assistance groups. The implementation plan would be&#13;
designed with the direct participation of the rural populations taking into account the&#13;
multifunctionality of the existing agro-ecosystems and thus the socio-economic parameters and&#13;
interests of the local community. This activity should be completed by the first year of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
5.20   The preparation of a detailed implementation plan for the Demand Management and&#13;
Inter-fuel Substitution Options Component will be done by the Energy Directorate with&#13;
specialized consultant support as needed, and should be completed by the first year of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
5.21   The design of a comprehensive project implementation communication strategy for the&#13;
entire project will be done by specialized consultants under the supervision of the PCU. This&#13;
activity should be completed by the first year of project implementation.&#13;
2. Component II: Sustainable Woodfuels Supply Management&#13;
5.22   The implementation of sustainable community-managed forest management systems&#13;
will be based on the legal transfer of the responsibility for the management and exploitation of&#13;
the forest resources to the rural communities. The expected implementation cycle of the&#13;
community-based participatory system in any given area/community is expected to last a total of&#13;
three years, going from full project involvement during the first year to gradual disengagement&#13;
staring on the second year until the third year, when mostly project funded monitoring and&#13;
evaluation systems would remain in place. As of the end of the first year of field implementation&#13;
the participating communities will be expected to assume an increasing responsibility over all&#13;
implementation aspects, including the funding from local revenue of follow-up technical&#13;
assistance. This sub-component will cover a total area of 300,000 ha -- reinforcing the protective&#13;
buffer zone that has been established around the Niokolo-Koba National Park -- within the six&#13;
years of field implementation period (year 2-7) in accordance with the approximate incremental&#13;
schedule presented in Table 5.3.&#13;
5.23   The national dead wood assessment will be executed by the Forestry Service with&#13;
specialized support from the Centre de Suivi Ecologique (CSE). The field work of the&#13;
assessment will be combined with the regular field activities of the regional Forestry Service&#13;
agents. This activity should be completed by the end of the second year of project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
5.24   The activities of technical support and extension for the implementation of the&#13;
participatory forest management modules and for the exploitation/production and marketing of&#13;
woodfuels (the introduction of improved carbonization technologies and other potential wood&#13;
and non-wood products) will be executed under different operational arrangement including, as&#13;
needed, a combination of Forestry Service agents, technical assistance support (FAO) and&#13;
selected specialized NGOs. In the case of carbonization activities, special attention will be given&#13;
to the monitoring and enforcement of the agreed improved methods and production standards.&#13;

5.25   The support for the establishment of rural-based micro-enterprises (community-operated&#13;
carbonization units, agro-forestry processing units, etc.) will be done by the PCU under&#13;
supervision of the two ministries (MEPT and MEMI). Micro-enterprise proposals will be&#13;
identified by the participating communities and or NGOs and elaborated by them with/without&#13;
specialized consultant support (individuals/NGOs). These proposals will be evaluated by the&#13;
PCU and decided upon on the basis of their individual merit. The size of the individual proposal&#13;
will vary but will be limited to a maximum equivalent of US $4,000 per village at any point in&#13;
time. The support for micro-enterprise development would be mobilize only when there is a&#13;
clear and tangible cofinancing of the local community in cash and/or kind (labor, natural&#13;
resources, tools, etc.). In the case of improved charcoal production, decision on support will be&#13;
further subject to the identification of monitoring and enforcement mechanisms for ensuring the&#13;
compliance at the community level with the charcoal related regulatory and policy framework.&#13;
The specific evaluation criteria, mechanisms and modalities for the mobilization of the micro-&#13;
enterprise development support will be finalized (satisfactory to IDA) during the Preparatory and&#13;
Support Activities Component. This sub-component will be executed throughout the full project&#13;
implementation year 1-7) by specialized consultants (individual and/or firm) under the&#13;
supervision of the PCU.&#13;
5.26   The implementation of the communication strategy for the Sustainable Woodfuels&#13;
Supply Management component. This sub-component will be executed throughout the entire&#13;
project field implementation cycle (year 2-7) by specialized consultants (individual and/or firms)&#13;
under the supervision of the PCU.&#13;
3. Component III: Demand Management and Interfuel Substitution Options&#13;
5.27   The support for the re-organization and modernization of the urban charcoal trade to&#13;
establish long-term supply agreements (contracts) between rural communities and urban traders&#13;
(to guarantee the unconstrained entry of community-produced woodfuels to the urban markets)&#13;
and to permit the standardization of the marketing units and the cleaning of the urban&#13;
environment (charcoal bagging);&#13;
5.28   The provision of technical assistance and limited financial support for the economic&#13;
diversification of existing urban charcoal traders ("exploitants forestiers ") will be based on the&#13;
proposal generated directly by charcoal traders. Thus far the proposals received include&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
enterprise diversification into LPG retail, gas service stations, foodstuffs retail and light transport&#13;
activities. The financial support to be provided by the project would be limited to organizational&#13;
and training activities and it would be executed by the Energy Directorate through specialized&#13;
private sector and enterprise development consultants and/or firms.&#13;
5.29   The execution of specific technical and market-feasibility studies to support the further&#13;
promotion of LPG and Kerosene as substitute household fuels will complement a GTZ-funded&#13;
study within the recently launched German-Senegalese Household Energy Assistance Project.&#13;
The main activity envisaged under this sub-component is limited to technical and market&#13;
feasibility research on kerosene stoves (including pilot testing of 1,000 stoves). This sub-&#13;
component would be executed by specialized consultants under the supervision of the&#13;
Directorate of Energy and should be completed within the third year of project implementation.&#13;
5.30   The provision of support for the continuation of inter-fuel substitution (kerosene and&#13;
LPG) and dissemination of improved stoves by the private sector and the NGO community will&#13;
be undertaken by the Directorate of Energy. Although it is expected that the private sector will&#13;
take charge of the implementation and funding of LPG and kerosene activities beyond the&#13;
proposed limited support activities (kerosene stove promotion and LPG decentralized depots), it&#13;
is possible that additional funding might be mobilized through GTZ or other sources to support&#13;
the expansion of kerosene as a least cost household fuel. All further LPG expansion activities&#13;
should be financed by the private sector. The support to the dissemination of improved stoves is&#13;
intended to provide limited investment funds to expand the market-based production capacity of&#13;
existing competitive stove manufacturer. No funding will be provided for stove scientific&#13;
research activities. Investment funding support will be approved only for stove options that&#13;
prove to be feasible on a non-subsidized production/full cost recovery basis. Based on the&#13;
proposals identified thus far, it is anticipated that the ATI DIAMBAR stove would qualify for&#13;
the intended investment funding support.&#13;
F. PROCUREMENT AND DISBURSEMENT&#13;
5.31   Cofinancing Arrangements. Cofinancing by GEF (US $4.7 million) and the Dutch&#13;
Cooperation (US $8.8 million) will be administered by the Bank, as agreed during negotiations.&#13;
All procurement under the project will follow Bank procurement guidelines.&#13;
5.32   Table 5.4 summarizes the project cost by disbursement category and proposed&#13;
procurement method. A detailed procurement plan and timetable are given in Annex 5.&#13;
Senegal's procurement laws and regulations are consistent with IDA procurement guidelines.&#13;
No special exemptions, permits or licenses need to be specified in Credit documents for&#13;
international competitive bidding (ICB), as Senegal's procurement regulations allow IDA&#13;
procedures to take precedence over any contrary provisions in local regulations.&#13;
5.33   Civil Works. The civil works program (US $1.0 million) includes a large number of&#13;
very small contracts for the implementation of supporting community projects such as well&#13;
diggings, construction of rural health centers and other civil work components of income&#13;
generating activities within the implementation of the Integrated Natural Resource Management&#13;
Modules (over an area of 300,000 ha) under the Sustainable woodfuel component (II). Civil&#13;
works contracts financed under the credit will be awarded through NCB procedures. Due to&#13;

large firms that use modem equipment. Foreign bidders, however, would not be precluded from&#13;
submitting bids. Civil works contract management for the supporting community projects will&#13;
be delegated to NGOs or other private entities as appropriate.&#13;
5.34   Equipment.  Equipment requirements (US $2.5 million) include vehicles under the&#13;
Preparatory and Support Activities Component (I), vehicles (4X4s and motorcycles) and fire&#13;
control trucks for the implementation of Integrated Natural Resource Management modules&#13;
under the Sustainable woodfuel component (II), and vehicles under the Demand Management&#13;
and Interfuel Substitution Options Component (III). Provided that the aggregate amount does not&#13;
exceed US $150,000 equivalent purchase through the United Nations Development Program's&#13;
Inter-Agency Procurement Services will be permitted for office equipment and vehicles.&#13;
5.35   Goods. Goods (US $5.4 million) include under the Sustainable Woodfuels Supply&#13;
Management Component, small tools and field equipment for the rural communities, office&#13;
and field equipment for the Forest Service (regional offices), small forest fire control equipment&#13;
and purchase of equipment for the implementation of supporting community projects. Under the&#13;
Demand Management and Inter-fuel Substitution options component, office equipment for the&#13;
DE, purchase of 1,000 kerosene stoves for the pilot program; purchase LPG bottles and burners.&#13;
Goods will be grouped into packages of at least US $100,000 each and procured through ICB in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
41&#13;
accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits&#13;
(January 1995, revised January and August 1996). Standard bidding documents developed by&#13;
the Bank will be used. A preferential margin of 15 percent or the applicable customs duty,&#13;
whichever is less, over the c.i.f. prices of competing goods for all ICB procurement will be given&#13;
to domestic firms in accordance with the Bank's guidelines. Small quantities of goods such as&#13;
office supplies, consumable materials, and small tools and field equipment for the rural&#13;
communities, which are available off-the-shelf and cannot be grouped into bidding packages of&#13;
at least US $25,000, because of the decentralized planning and implementation functions that&#13;
will be carried out by the implementation agents (regional project offices, NGOs, community&#13;
groups, etc.), may be procured through local shopping, based on price quotations of at least three&#13;
reliable suppliers. All bids will be submitted on a c.i.f. basis for imported goods and on ex-&#13;
factory basis for locally manufactured goods.&#13;
5.36   Consultant services. Consultant services (US $3.5 million) include long-term resident&#13;
technical assistance in the form of TA personnel for the DE (US $0.3 million) and consultant&#13;
services for training activities and execution of studies (vegetation cover assessment, design of&#13;
monitoring and supervision systems, energy demand, etc.). In particular, the training activities&#13;
for consulting services will be required include all the capacity building, institutional&#13;
development (governmental institutions, civil society and NGOs), and participatory activities of&#13;
the Project. Within the Preparatory and Support Activities Component (I) the main training&#13;
activities will entail capacity building and institutional development of the Forestry Service and&#13;
Energy Directorate staff and participatory rural appraisals work. Within the Sustainable&#13;
woodfuel component (II) key training activities will be focused on the rural communities and&#13;
NGOs that will be responsible for the direct implementation of the sustainable forest&#13;
management modules. Within the Demand Management Component (III) the main training&#13;
activities will include the staff of the Energy Directorate and support services to the Charcoal&#13;
Traders (economic reconversion sub-component). International and local consultants providing&#13;
specialist services would be selected through Quality-and Cost-based and Least Cost procedures,&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's Guidelines for the Use of Consultants (February 1997). The&#13;
standard Letter of Invitation and Form of Contract as developed by the Bank will be used for&#13;
appointment of consultants. Simplified contracts will be used for short-term assignments, i.e.&#13;
those not exceeding six months, carried out by individual consultants. Individual consultants&#13;
will be recruited on the basis of comparison of at least three (3) CVs taken from a roster&#13;
organized by specialties. Single-source hiring of individual consultants, if any, is subject to&#13;
Bank prior review. The NGOs or other private entities who are delegated Construction&#13;
management for the implementation of community-support projects will recruit the necessary&#13;
consultant services in accordance with the above-stated procedures.&#13;
5.37   Review by IDA.  Contracts for works and goods above the threshold value of US&#13;
$100,000 equivalent will be subject to IDA prior review procedures. The review process would&#13;
cover 70 percent of the total value of the amount contracted for goods and 56 percent of the&#13;
amount contracted for civil works. Selective post-review of contracts awarded below the&#13;
threshold levels will apply to about one in three contracts. Draft standard bidding documents for&#13;
NCB will be reviewed by and agreed upon with IDA. Prior IDA review will not apply to&#13;
contracts for the recruitment of consulting firms and individuals estimated to cost less than US&#13;
$75,000 and US $35,000 equivalent respectively. However, the exception to prior IDA review&#13;
will not apply to the Terms of Reference of such contracts, regardless of value, to single-source&#13;
hiring of firms, to assignments of a critical nature as determined by IDA or to amendments of&#13;
contracts raising the contract value above the prior review threshold.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
42&#13;
5.38   Proposed Procurement Arrangements.  During negotiations agreement was reached&#13;
on monitoring of procurement as well as the Bank's Standard Bidding Documents for ICB and&#13;
the standard procurement documents for NCB to be developed, reviewed by, and agreed upon&#13;
with IDA. The Government will submit to IDA for review: (a) a draft procurement plan; (b) a&#13;
draft Procedural Manual for Management and procurement; and (c) a draft bidding document&#13;
for the construction program and major equipment, as well as draft letters of invitation for&#13;
consultants services, related to activities financed by IDA during the first project year. The&#13;
Government will submit to IDA the final versions of these documents and gave assurances at&#13;
negotiations that it will apply the procurement procedures and arrangements outlined in the&#13;
above documents.&#13;
5.39   Disbursements.   The project is expected to be completed over a seven-year period,&#13;
with the IDA Credit disbursed over 8 years, according to the categories shown in Table 5.5,&#13;
below. The estimated disbursement profile is shown in Annex 6. Disbursement of the Credit&#13;
will be fully documented except for expenditures which would be made against Statements of&#13;
Expenditure (SOEs) valued at less than US $100,000 equivalent for firms and US $50,000&#13;
equivalent for individual consultants. Documentation for withdrawals under SOEs would be&#13;
retained by the PCU for review by IDA supervision missions and for semi-annual audits.&#13;

5.41   Special Account. To facilitate disbursements, the Government will open a Special&#13;
Account (SA) in a commercial bank in Dakar to cover IDA's share of eligible expenditures,&#13;
managed by the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU). The authorized allocation for the SA would&#13;
be US $450,000 equivalent. IDA will make an initial deposit of US $250,000 equivalent into the&#13;
SA upon credit effectiveness and will replenish the SA upon receipt of satisfactory proof of&#13;
incurred eligible expenditures.  Replenishment will be accompanied by up-to-date bank&#13;
statements and reconciliation of the SA. To expedite the implementation of day-to-day activities&#13;

currency at the district level, a SGSA (Second Generation Special Account) will be opened at&#13;
each of the Kolda and Tambacounda regions. Each district Forestry officer will be responsible&#13;
for establishing a yearly budget for the activities to be carried out, and necessary funds would be&#13;
regularly provided on the basis of justification. Accounts of the SGSA will be reconciled every&#13;
quarter with the PCU accountant, and funds made against eligible expenditures will be&#13;
replenished through the project account. Justifications of expenditure eligibility will be handed&#13;
over to the project accountant and kept as supporting documents for the use of the Statement of&#13;
Expenditures procedure.&#13;
5.42   The PCU would establish and maintain its accounts in accordance with International&#13;
Accounting Standards, and would conserve all the documentation related to project expenditures.&#13;
A detailed proposal on the accounting system and procedures to be followed and a profile of&#13;
personnel needed and equipment required would be prepared by consultants. The conditions for&#13;
the establishment of a financial management and accounting system for the project, acceptable to&#13;
IDA, were agreed during negotiations. The PCU will at all times keep financial records in&#13;
accordance with sound accounting practices to reflect its operations and financial position.&#13;
These records would be made available to visiting Bank missions and independent auditors. The&#13;
project accounts, including the SA and the SGSA, will be audited annually, in accordance with&#13;
International Standard of Auditing, by independent external auditors acceptable to IDA. In order&#13;
to facilitate the post review of procurement decisions not subject to IDA prior review, the&#13;
auditor's TOR would include a provision for a separate opinion on the consistency of such&#13;
procurement decisions with Bank Procurement Guidelines and provisions. The audited accounts&#13;
and the auditor's report, including the Management Letter (Long Form) and a statement as to&#13;
whether or not IDA funds had been used for their intended purpose and a separate opinion with&#13;
respect to statement of expenditures and the Special Account, as well as the SGSAs, would be&#13;
submitted to IDA within six months of the end of the fiscal year for the Project. Assurances to&#13;
this effect were reached at negotiations. Agreement was reached at negotiations on the selection&#13;
procedures for the awarding of a multi-year contract for the auditing the Project accounts (para.&#13;
7.1.iii).&#13;
5.43   Overall implementation of the project would be supervised on an annual basis by IDA&#13;
and disbursements would be contingent on the satisfactory compliance with all project&#13;
conditions. In addition to annual supervision, the project would be evaluated in accordance with&#13;
established IDA procedures at mid-implementation (first semester of the fourth year) and at its&#13;
completion.  Three specific monitoring systems have been included in the project to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44&#13;
systematically evaluate the implementation process of key components and the realization of the&#13;
expected national and global benefits. These are: (i) a forest resources exploitation monitoring&#13;
system for the Tambacounda and Kolda regions, to supervise compliance with established&#13;
exploitation plans and to evaluate the achievement of resource sustainability and to assess the&#13;
impact of the project activities in the adjacent areas (Niokolo-Koba National Park and other open&#13;
forests); (ii) a wildlife monitoring system, to evaluate the realization of the intended biodiversity&#13;
objectives and benefits, with particular emphasis on the monitoring of endemic and threatened&#13;
species; and (iii) a national woodfuels trade flows monitoring system, to evaluate compliance&#13;
with established woodfuels transport and market quota regulations (source, volume and&#13;
destination). In addition to these activities, the project would include a systematic monitoring&#13;
and evaluation of the: (i) promotion and penetration of kerosene and LPG as substitute household&#13;
fuels; (ii) dissemination and cooking performance of improved stoves; (iii) participation of civil&#13;
society (with emphasis on women) in design, decision making and implementation activities&#13;
within the project; (iv) developmental impacts on women; and (v) realization of institutional&#13;
development and capacity building objectives. All monitoring and evaluation activities will be&#13;
based on an ex-ante assessment, will be carried out through implementation to allow for&#13;
necessary design adjustments, and will be followed-up after completion to evaluate the long-term&#13;
sustainability of the project's national developmental and global environmental achievements.&#13;

VI.   PROJECT IMPACT&#13;
A. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
6.1.   The economic analysis of the natural resource management activities in developing&#13;
countries has been the subject of much work and controversy. Different methodologies have&#13;
been elaborated for individual cases making use of available data (resource stocks, depletion and&#13;
regeneration rates, real prices, economic value, etc.) and relative social values (environmental&#13;
conservation, resource sustainability, social preferences, etc.).&#13;
6.2   In the absence of a clear methodological consensus (Bank or elsewhere), a simplified&#13;
economic analysis methodology was developed for the evaluation of the proposed project. The&#13;
methodology and evaluation results are presented in detail in Annex 8. The approach adopted is&#13;
based on the following basic guidelines:&#13;
Project components.  All three components of the project (Preparatory and support&#13;
Activities Component; Sustainable Supply Management Component; and Demand&#13;
Management and Inter-fuel Substitution Options Component) where included in the&#13;
economic analysis as they are judged to be necessary and integral elements of the&#13;
proposed investment. Within that context, no differential valuation treatment was given&#13;
to investments for productive (forest management, improved kilns, improved stoves,&#13;
inter-fuel substitution options, etc.) or non-productive sub-components (data generation&#13;
and gathering, institutional development, capacity building, social support services,&#13;
communication strategy, etc.).&#13;
Time horizon and Discount rate. Given the long-term nature of the expected project&#13;
impacts, a minimum 20-year horizon was adopted for the evaluation of the project. A&#13;
discount rate of 12 percent was applied to all project components and sub-components.&#13;
Pject costs. All budgeted costs during project implementation (7 years) were included&#13;
in the economic analysis of the project. From years 8 to 20 continued implementation&#13;
costs where assessed at approximately 10 percent of year 7, gradually decreasing at a&#13;
relative rate of 10 percent per year until year 20.&#13;
Project benefits. While the proposed project is expected to result in a large number of&#13;
quantifiable and non-quantifiable benefits, the economic analysis undertaken limited the&#13;
valuation to the following benefits: (i) value of "sustainable" wood production from the&#13;
implementation of the sustainable and participatory forest/natural resource management&#13;
systems; (ii) value of incremental charcoal production from the promotion of improved&#13;
kilns; (iii) value of global environmental impacts (CO2 abatement and biodiversity&#13;
conservation) from the implementation of the sustainable and participatory forest/natural&#13;
resource management systems; (iv) value of rural income generation and transfer from&#13;
the direct sales of fuelwood by the participating rural communities; (v) value of "other"&#13;
rural revenues from the development of parallel agro-forestry production activities in the&#13;
participating communities; and (vi) value of charcoal saying due to the promotion of&#13;
improved charcoal stoves. As the full elaboration and quantification of other project&#13;
activities (promotion of inter-fuel substitution options, economic reconversion of&#13;
charcoal traders, modernization of the charcoal industry, etc.) will be done during the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
48&#13;
Preparatory and Support Activities component (Component I) it was judged premature to&#13;
make estimates on their respective possible benefits (the full cost of those activities was&#13;
however included in the project cost).&#13;
6.3    The 20-year horizon evaluation of the project resulted in an Economic Rate of Return&#13;
(ERR) of 37.3% and a net present value (NPV) at 12 percent discount rate of US $ 34.2 million.&#13;
According to these economic evaluation results, the proposed project would be a fully justifiable&#13;
and competitive developmental investment for Senegal.&#13;
6.4   Sensitivity analyses were done for five key parameters: (i) level of sustainable forest&#13;
yields (0.5 - 2.0 ton/ha/yr); (ii) fuelwood producer prices (US$ 10 - 30/ton); (iii) carbonization&#13;
efficiency of improved kilns (18% - 30%); (iv) level of "other" realizable rural income (15% -&#13;
40% of expected fuelwood sales); (v) Charcoal market prices (US$ 190 - 360/ton). Table 5.7&#13;
presents a summary of the sensitivity analysis of the five key parameter, including the main&#13;
value variations considered ("base", low and high) and the respective switching value.&#13;

would continue to be a fully justifiable and competitive developmental investment for Senegal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
B. SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS&#13;
6.6    The project would: (i) sustainably produce some 860,000 tons of fuelwood (equivalent&#13;
to 258,000 tons of efficiently produced charcoal) over a six year period and would establish a&#13;
permanent system capable of producing more than 300,000 tons of fuelwood (equivalent to&#13;
90,000 tons of efficiently produced charcoal or 27% of total consumption) per year on a&#13;
sustainable basis; (ii) reduce woodfuels-related deforestation in the Tambacounda and Kolda&#13;
regions by some 20,000 ha/year, and as a consequence reduce net CO2 emissions by 510,000&#13;
tons/yr and reduce the loss of biodiversity by the establishment of sustainable forest systems and&#13;
of a protective buffer zone around the Niokolo-Koba National Park; (iii) generate employment&#13;
and economic development opportunities in 250 rural villages in the Tambacounda and Kolda&#13;
regions and including women in the management and marketing of woodfuels and other related&#13;
income generating activities; (iv) generate during the implementation period more than US $10&#13;
million in direct revenues to 250 villages from the trade of woodfuels, and generate additional&#13;
revenues to the communities from related natural resource management and exploitation&#13;
activities (agro-forestry, livestock keeping, non-fuelwood forest products, etc.);  (v) on a&#13;
sustainable annual basis after the end of the project, generate direct revenues in excess of US $3&#13;
million to the participating villages from the trade of woodfuels, and generate additional&#13;
revenues from related natural resource management and exploitation activities; (vi) reduce CO2&#13;
emissions by 420,000 tons/yr. by the distribution of 225,000 improved charcoal stoves; (vii)&#13;
increase the availability and access of low income households to more reliable and efficient&#13;
charcoal stoves and to modem fuels; and (viii) strengthen the planning, policy making and&#13;
implementation supervision capacity of the traditional energy sector institutions, while&#13;
increasing the participation of the civil society (private sector, academic institutions, and NGO's&#13;
community) in the management and operation of the sector.&#13;
6.7    Environmental Aspects (Category C).  The project is expected to: (i) reduce&#13;
deforestation and soil degradation through the implementation of sustainable forest management&#13;
practices on a large scale; (ii) contribute to reducing the loss of carbon sequestration capacity&#13;
and of biodiversity that results from the prevailing non-sustainable exploitation of woodfuels and&#13;
from forest fires and, over time, increase carbon sequestration capacity and stabilize biodiversity&#13;
through the extension of sustainable natural resource management practices nationwide; (iii)&#13;
reduce CO2 emissions through the promotion of better carbonization techniques and the&#13;
promotion of more fuel efficient household stoves; (iv) reduce urban charcoal pollution and&#13;
contamination (soil and water) and reduce incidence of respiratory diseases (continuous exposure&#13;
to charcoal dust) among charcoal handlers and retailers (which are mostly women) through the&#13;
modernization of the charcoal marketing standards (sealed bags); and (v) reduce indoor air&#13;
pollution and reduce health risks to women through the promotion of improved woodfuel stoves.&#13;
6.8   The project is not expected to have negative environmental impacts. The relocation of&#13;
production sites to other areas is not likely to happen because:&#13;
(i)  there are no other geographic areas in Senegal with forest resources (volume and&#13;
density) which can be economically exploited to supply the large woodfuels urban&#13;
markets;&#13;
(ii)  areas with sufficient forest resources -- and not necessarily more fragile -- in&#13;
(Casamance) and outside Senegal (Guinea) are 350 to 500 km further away from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
the urban markets than what Kolda and Tambacounda. Their exploitation would&#13;
imply dramatically increase transportation costs (up to 50%);&#13;
(iii) the existing charcoal production control system, albeit cumbersome and&#13;
inequitable, has been historically effective in controlling spatial production of&#13;
charcoal and there is no basis to believe that it would be any less effective under&#13;
the project, particularly given that there is stated government commitment for&#13;
project implementation; and&#13;
(iv) the willingness of individuals to engage in illegal charcoal production would be&#13;
determined by the profitability of doing so. As illegal charcoal production would&#13;
happen over and above the officially approved production quota, illegal production&#13;
would result on product surpluses. Illegal charcoal would then be transacted at&#13;
below official wholesale prices rendering its profit margin much lower than the&#13;
legal trade. The larger the surplus, the lower the parallel wholesale price would&#13;
be. The probability of this actually happening is near to zero because potential&#13;
illegal producers would be discouraged by the prospects of reduced market prices,&#13;
increased transportation costs and high probability of being caught and of&#13;
receiving stiff fines in the process. In any event, the project includes monitoring&#13;
and evaluation systems (forest exploitation and transport flows) designed to&#13;
capture any illegal production and/or movement of woodfuels. The monitoring of&#13;
woodfuel transport flows in the Senegalese case are far simpler than in other West&#13;
African countries (e.g. Mali) because there is only one access route from the&#13;
production sites (south- west and south of the country) to the urban markets&#13;
capable of handling the 15 and 30 ton trucks a day that are used in the trade.&#13;
Illegal charcoal flows from Ziguinchor to Dakar through the Gambia river ferry&#13;
would be subject to far easier control mechanism at the ferry docks and the&#13;
respective national border check-points;&#13;
C. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
6.9    The sustainability of the project would be achieved by the following key design factors:&#13;
(i)  the effective transfer of responsibility for the management of the forest resources&#13;
from the Government to the rural communities;&#13;
(ii) the effective opening-up of the woodfuels trading system;&#13;
(iii) a gradual change in woodfuels fiscal and pricing policies and mechanisms -- which&#13;
will be designed on the basis of project's field experience and the findings of&#13;
several studies and enacted by December 31, 2000 -- to inter alia: promote&#13;
sustainable management of forest resources by rural communities; discourage the&#13;
exploitation of woodfuels from non-managed forest areas; promote the use of&#13;
improved carbonization technologies; maximize direct woodfuel-related revenues&#13;
at the producer level; and, optimize the economic efficiency of the sector taking&#13;
into account the real economic value of woodfuels (para. 7.1 .iv); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
51&#13;
(iv) the strengthening of the long-term capacity of the rural communities to manage&#13;
their forest resources sustainably.&#13;
6.10   Specific activities and monitoring systems have been included in the project design to&#13;
address all these issues.&#13;
D. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
6.11   While it is expected that in the process of transferring part of the industry's activity to&#13;
the rural communities the project will affect a small portion (27%) of charcoal traders and of&#13;
expatriate charcoal laborers ("surghas"), that impact cannot be seen in isolation from the&#13;
ongoing Africa-wide process towards democratization and local community enpowerment.&#13;
Senegal is no different than other countries in the region, and numerous instances of major&#13;
structural change are already underway throughout the economy. Nevertheless, recognizing that&#13;
the reaction of the traditional traders and "surghas" pose a moderate risk to the project, special&#13;
attention was paid to including them in the preparation of the project. Furthermore, two project&#13;
activities were specifically designed to support the existing traders to adjust to the new situation&#13;
(see "Project Description" section). Also, other activities were designed to monitor and prevent&#13;
possible implementation interference (see "Monitoring and Evaluation" section). Also, the&#13;
project would be only one of numerous government-lead developmental activities which would&#13;
be supported by official regulatory and legal measures.&#13;
6.12   Since the project will limit the exploitation of woodfuels in the project area to the&#13;
participating rural communities, the possibility that charcoal production by traditional traders&#13;
could switch to other areas of the country has been raised. This, however, is not expected to&#13;
occur as charcoal production is regulated by government and is now subjected to the new&#13;
provisions of local community approval. Should traditional traders attempt to relocate their&#13;
activities, the affected local communities would be legally empowered to stop them and --&#13;
contrary to the past -- the Government would be obliged to protect the communities' interests.&#13;
Should this happen, however, the project includes a forest resource monitoring system which,&#13;
operated independently from the Government and with international donor supervision, would be&#13;
responsible for reporting non-regulated forest exploitation.&#13;
6.13   The risk of an illegal relocation of charcoal production happening and resulting in&#13;
increased environmental degradation of more ecologically fragile areas has been raised but&#13;
considered negligible after further examination. A detailed Environmental Impact Discussion&#13;
Note that was prepared for internal discussion early on in the project preparation phase is&#13;
available in the project files.&#13;
6.14   Finally, the risk that the rural populations might not be able to achieve full sustainable&#13;
management of the forest resources cannot be entirely ruled out. Nevertheless, even in that case,&#13;
the project would result in a considerable transfer of welfare to the rural communities with&#13;
unquestionable economic development opportunities and social benefits and significant national&#13;
and global environmental benefits.&#13;

THE NIOKOLO-KOBA NATIONAL PARK&#13;
DESCRIPTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
(Extract from: Monogphie National sur la Diversite Biologique: Chapitre 3: "Les&#13;
Modes de Gestion des Ressources Naturelles Au Senegal et leur Evolution"&#13;
IUCN-Senega1, (1995)&#13;
(Working level translation from original French text)&#13;
The Niokolo-Koba National Park is located on the border of the administrative regions&#13;
of Tambacounda and Kolda, on the Gambia River, near the Guinnean border on the South-East&#13;
of Senegal. It is located inside a slightly undulating region with chains of hills reaching an&#13;
altitude of about 200 meters, separated by vast areas of lower situated floodplains that are&#13;
covered by water during the rainy season. The Gambia river and its two main tributaries, the&#13;
Niokolo-Koba and the Koulountou, pass through the park. The vegetation is constituted of&#13;
mainly dry forests, wooded savannas, Sudanian trees and shrubs with principal species such as&#13;
Pterocarpus erinaceous, Bombax costatum, Erythrophleum africanum, Sterculia setigera and a&#13;
number of Combretum species. According to FAOIUNEP (1981), 78% of the country's "foret&#13;
galeries" are located inside this park. About 1,500 plant species have been registered inside this&#13;
park. An example of the region's valuable flora can be found in the laterite zones. Here several&#13;
species reside at their most western limit of distribution, for example Eragrostis popeguini,&#13;
Adelostigma perrottetii, Andropogon felicis, Cyathula pobeguini and several species of&#13;
Lepidagathis. Around 80 mammal species, 330 bird species, 36 reptile species, 2 amphibious&#13;
species and 60 fish species are found in the Park, along with numerous invertebrates. Carnivores&#13;
include the panther Panthere pardus, the lion P. leo and the African wolf Lycaon picturs. The&#13;
Park's three main water streams are the habitat for the buffalo Syncerus caffer, the antelope&#13;

MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF THE GEF ACTIVITIES&#13;
1.     The monitoring and evaluation of GEF activities included in the project are: (i) the forest&#13;
resources exploitation, (ii) the wildlife distribution, (iii) the socio-economic situation of the target&#13;
group and (iv) the community-participation and institutional involvement.&#13;
2.     The actors involved in these monitoring and evaluation activities will be the Centre de&#13;
Suivi Ecologique, the Forest Service, the villagers, some technical assistance and NGO's (yet to be&#13;
identified) which are involved in natural resources management. Although the final evaluation of&#13;
the impact of this component of the project will be a joint effort of the different actors, not all&#13;
monitoring activities will always be undertaken by all actors. The exact role of each actor within the&#13;
different activities will be discussed in the field.&#13;
3.     Before the project interventions start, actual trends in land use in the districts of Kolda and&#13;
Tambacounda will be investigated through satellite remote sensing, statistics and field trips. The&#13;
focus will be on the:&#13;
- location of villages, roads, water streams, watershed areas, arable land, forest land,&#13;
grazing land, fallow land cultivated land and severely degraded land,&#13;
- human population densities,&#13;
- composition and densities of wildlife and livestock,&#13;
- composition and productivity of crops,&#13;
- identification of forest types and their condition (maturing state, clear-out, burnt etc.),&#13;
- identification of grazing land types and their condition (perennial, overgrazed, burnt&#13;
etc.).&#13;
4.     Participatory Rural Appraisal's (PRA) will be undertaken to verify the above obtained data&#13;
and to gather more specific information on the present situation of:&#13;
- delimitation of village territory borders&#13;
- land tenure practices and conflicts (e.g. who decides where and when forest land will be&#13;
cleared for agricultural expansion),&#13;
- village community structures,&#13;
- NGO's active in natural resources management,&#13;
- collaboration between village-communities, the Forest Service, Centre de Suivi-&#13;
Ecologique, and NGO's,&#13;
- variety of income resources,&#13;
- composing elements of the agro-ecosystems (e.g. is hunting an important source of&#13;
income, and so yes for whom?),&#13;
- identity of important non-fuelwood products present in the forests.&#13;
- identity of various stakeholders (with gender specification) involved in different&#13;
components of the agro-ecosystems with special attention for the forest component&#13;
(both fuelwood and non-fuelwood products)&#13;
- location and practice of subsistence fuelwood collection&#13;
- interest of different villages in collaborating with the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex-2&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
5.     From these data a "baseline situation on a regional level" (not to be confuse with the "GEF&#13;
Baseline Scenario" mentioned before) will be described. This document will (i) represent an&#13;
improved comprehension of the interaction of the different components of the agro-ecosystems, (ii)&#13;
facilitate the selection of villages that will take part in the project and (iii) enable evaluation of the&#13;
projects impact during project implementation and at its completion.&#13;
6.     Once the participating villages are selected, a more detailed description of the baseline&#13;
situation of these villages will be prepared. That information will be particularly detailed on the&#13;
condition of the forest with regard of both flora and fauna species which are highly valued either by&#13;
local and/or global standards. (e.g. the tree Pterocarpus erinaceus is of interest for timber, fuelwood&#13;
and fodder production but is threatened in the region).&#13;
7.     "Monitoring in the field at the regional level" will continue annually throughout the&#13;
project cycle and will be concentrated on forest exploitation and wildlife and livestock (distribution&#13;
and density).&#13;
8.     Concerning forest exploitation, the monitoring will include the location and size of the&#13;
deforested areas, the type of forest concerned and the apparent cause for deforestation (agricultural&#13;
expansion, charcoal production, forest fire or other). If the cause was "clear-cut for charcoal&#13;
production" the logging technique practised will be recorded (species harvested, height of cutting,&#13;
etc.). If the cause was forest fires, the damage will be described. Subsequently, the villages where&#13;
forest cutting took place - excluding those which are selected within the project and therefore will&#13;
have special treatment - will be visited to verify the apparent cause and to inquire whether the&#13;
villages were in control and if so why, how and by whom the decision was made.&#13;
9.     The forest exploitation monitoring will primarily be undertaken by the "Centre the Suivi&#13;
Ecologique - CSE" in collaboration with the Forest Service. The visits to the villages will&#13;
strengthen the collaboration between these services and the local communities while creating&#13;
environmental awareness. Also the villages will be instructed to contact these services in case they&#13;
are confronted with illegal intrusion and/or tree cutting by outsiders.&#13;
10.    Regarding wildlife and livestock distribution and density the monitoring will be undertaken&#13;
seasonally as to cover the movements of the animals. This activity will most likely be executed by&#13;
NGO's (e.g. IUCN) in collaboration with the Centre the Suivi Ecologique and the villagers. This&#13;
again will strengthen the collaboration between services, NGO's and villagers while creating&#13;
environmental awareness and discouraging illegal hunting.&#13;
11.    "Monitoring in the field at the village level" in the selected villages will continue&#13;
annually after the implementation of sustainable forest management practices. The monitoring will&#13;
again be focused on forest exploitation and distribution and density of wildlife and livestock.&#13;
12.    During forest exploitation monitoring, the parameters to be investigated are:&#13;
- location, size and condition of severely degraded parcels which are put aside and&#13;
receive regeneration treatment&#13;
- location and size of deforested area for agricultural expansion&#13;
- location and timing of forest fires&#13;
- location and timing of forest grazing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
- location and amounts of wood harvested for charcoal production&#13;
- harvesting techniques practised (clear-cut, or selective logging)&#13;
- height of logging, diameter and identity of species harvested&#13;
- forest damage caused by other reasons such as natural disasters&#13;
13.   Within the village community, the results will be compared with the original sustainable&#13;
forest management plan and if necessary the management plan for the next year will be adjusted.&#13;
If, based on the results, the new forest management appears to create a need for adjustment in other&#13;
areas of the agro-ecosystem, assistance in these areas will be provided by the project (e.g.&#13;
intensification of agriculture). This process of regular adjustment of forest management planning&#13;
will be a learning process for both the forest agencies and the villagers, while strengthening their&#13;
collaboration and making them independent of technical assistance after project implementation.&#13;
14.   Regarding the monitoring of wildlife and livestock density and distribution, the number per&#13;
species (with distinction of common, endemic or threatened species if it concems wildlife) and the&#13;
location and the vegetation type where they were encountered will be recorded seasonally. As in&#13;
the regional monitoring, this activity will strengthen collaboration between services, NGO's and&#13;
villagers while creating environmental awareness and discouraging illegal hunting.&#13;
15.   At the end of the project, the compilation of data from the annual monitoring and&#13;
evaluation activities on both regional and selected villages level, will be used to evaluate the impact&#13;
of the project on forest resources exploitation, biodiversity conservation, socio-economic situation,&#13;
community-participatory and institutional strengthening within the region.&#13;
Demand Management and Inter-fuel Substitution Options (Non-GEF funded activities)&#13;
16.   Within the Demand Management and Inter-fuel Substitution component the improved&#13;
woodfuel stoves sub-component will be subject to periodic monitoring and evaluation.&#13;
17.   The monitoring and evaluation will be a joint action between the producers, the retailers,&#13;
the users, technical assistance and NGO's (yet to be identified) with particular interest for issues&#13;
related to women and either health or environment. The exact organisation of the monitoring and&#13;
evaluation will be designed by the actors in the field during the Preparatory and Support Activities&#13;
component.&#13;
18.   Before the implementation of the improved stoves sub-component, monitoring of potential&#13;
users will focus on:&#13;
- number of people per household&#13;
- number and type of woodfuel stoves used&#13;
- daily cooking tasks of these stoves&#13;
- daily amount of woodfuels used per household&#13;
- how and from where woodfuels are obtained&#13;
- woodfuel prices and mode of payment (how, who)&#13;
- average lifetime of traditional woodfuel stoves&#13;
- price paid for woodfuel stoves and mode of payment ( how, who)&#13;
- where is being cooked, indoors or outdoors&#13;
- symptoms of respiratory problems within the household related to the smoke of cooking&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
- complaints about traditional woodfuel stoves&#13;
- interest in improved woodfuel stoves&#13;
19.    These data will be used for the description of the baseline situation and for the selection of&#13;
potential users interested in participating in the monitoring procedures.&#13;
20.    When a traditional woodfuel stove is to be replaced by an improved woodfuel stove the&#13;
user will be asked to record: (i) the daily woodfuel use since using the improved woodfuel stove,&#13;
(ii) whether the situation in regard to respiratory problems has been improved in case there were&#13;
such problems prior to the use of improved stoves, (iii) the appreciation of the improved stove in&#13;
general and (iv) suggestions for modification of the improved stove if considered important.&#13;
21.    The results will be used to (i) verify the combustion efficiency of the improved stoves (ii)&#13;
to verify its supposed mitigation power related to respiratory problems and (iii) to consider users&#13;
comments in the production of new stoves.&#13;

INCREMENTAL COSTS AND GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS&#13;
A.    Broad Development Goals&#13;
1.    Senegal's traditional energy sector policy is directed towards meeting the rapidly&#13;
growing urban demands of traditional forest-based fuels by the development of community&#13;
based sustainable forest management, by the introduction of efficient carbonization of fuelwood,&#13;
by the promotion of improved woodfuel stoves -- essentially charcoal -- and by promoting inter-&#13;
fuel substitution. This strategy is expected to minimize further environmental degradation and to&#13;
foster rural development.&#13;
I. Business-as-Usual Scenario&#13;
2.    At this point in time, the Tambacounda and Kolda regions (located in the southeastern&#13;
part of the country, Figure 1) are the only regions of the country which have sufficient resources&#13;
to be able to supply non-local demand (urban) for woodfuels, estimated in 1992 at some 520,000&#13;
tons of fuelwood and 330,000 to is of charcoal (equivalent to some 1.8 million tons of fuelwood).&#13;
Within these regions some 30,000 ha of forested land is annually clear-cut for the commercial&#13;
production of urban woodfuels while no measures are undertaken to allow regeneration. This&#13;
non-sustainable deforestation takes place in addition to continuous destruction of forest by&#13;
uncontrolled forest fires and relentless agricultural expansion. Due to inefficient carbonization&#13;
of  fuelwood  toward charcoal (18%  vs. 30%), the exploitation pressure on forests is&#13;
unnecessary high. Presently, the charcoal business is effectively in the hands of some 20 urban&#13;
families with little participation in the production activities or the sharing of the profits by the&#13;
rural communities. Although specific governmental regulations exists to orient and monitor the&#13;
exploitation of the forest resources and the Forestry Service (Ministry of Environment and&#13;
Protection of Nature) is responsible for the conservation of the country's forest patrimony, the&#13;
Government does not have the financial resources or manpower capacity to control the situation&#13;
on the ground let alone to implement government-run sustainable forest resource management in&#13;
the country.&#13;
3.    In the absence of any form of integrated land-use planning and/or strategies, the forest&#13;
areas that are clear-cut are not allowed to regenerate because after the forest is removed the land&#13;
is immediately used either for agriculture, grazing or subsistence fuelwood collection. The&#13;
situation of Senegal follows the same destructive land-use pattern consistently observed&#13;
throughout other developing countries. The continued non-sustainable (clear-cut) commercial&#13;
exploitation of forest for the supply of woodfuels and particularly of charcoal, results in a&#13;
continuous loss of carbon sequestration capacity (decrease of forest stocks) and hence an&#13;
increase in net CO2 emissions.  In addition to the resulting generalized environmental&#13;
degradation, the current geographic location and the expected exploitation expansion path poses&#13;
a considerable risk to the Niokolo-Koba National Park, which is located in the intersection of&#13;
the Tambacounda and Kolda regions, and which has been classified as a national and&#13;
international "Biosphere Reserve".&#13;

II. Baseline scenario&#13;
4.     The Forestry Service would implement a traditional free standing forestry management&#13;
project. Very little collaboration would take place with the population residing in the project&#13;
area. Sustainable forest management would be mostly undertaken by the Forestry Service.&#13;
Ideally, they would partially clear-cut the forest based on the regeneration cycle of the forest&#13;
ecosystem and allowing for fallow periods, prevent forest fires and protect the area against other&#13;
uses such as agricultural and grazing activities. However, because of the Government's limited&#13;
manpower, they would only be able to achieve these goals partially (50%). Only Forestry&#13;
Service agents would receive training in sustainable forest management. The project would&#13;
cover a non-contiguous and dispersed target area of 300,000 ha within the Tambacounda and&#13;
Kolda regions, most likely close to existing roads to facilitate the access. As the rural population&#13;
would have a minimal involvement in the implementation of the project and in the sharing of the&#13;
resulting economic benefits, the project - being mostly dependent on continuous and direct&#13;
governmental management, would only have a limited effect within the specific target area and&#13;
for the duration of the project. No improved charcoal production would be introduced because&#13;
this has been tried earlier by the Government through the promotion of the "Cassamance kiln"&#13;
and did not work due to poor program design and implementation. On the other hand, an&#13;
improved stove dissemination program by the private sector and NGO community would be&#13;
supported to reduce woodfuels demand. At the end of the implementation of the free-standing&#13;
forestry management project -- and in the absence of a follow-up project -- the sustainable&#13;
management practices introduced in the target area would not be self-sustainable, the area's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 3 of 16&#13;
forest stock would be prey to the traditional non-sustainable exploitation and land-use patterns&#13;
and, thus, the accrual of global environmental benefits would end. Furthermore, as carbon&#13;
sequestration capacity, CO2 emissions and biodiversity are directly related to the state of&#13;
conservation of the forest stocks, in the long-term, the Baseline Scenario would equal the&#13;
Business-as-Usual Scenario in terms of global environmental benefits.&#13;
Global Environmental Objective&#13;
5.    The global environmental objective of the proposed GEF financing would be to bring the&#13;
net CO2 emission associated to the production of charcoal in the project area to zero, to maintain&#13;
and expand the existing carbon sequestration capacity, and to protect and maintain the&#13;
biodiversity in the Niokolo-Koba National Park which would be endangered by both the&#13;
Business-as-Usual and the Baseline scenarios.&#13;
MII. GEF Alternative Scenario&#13;
6.    Under the GEF Alternative Scenario, sustainable forest management, by selective&#13;
logging, would be implemented by transferring the responsibility for the management and&#13;
exploitation of the forest resources to the rural communities, and the project area would be&#13;
specifically established to form a protective buffer zone around the Niokolo-Koba National&#13;
Park (Figure 2). Sustainable forest management plans would be designed together with the&#13;
rural populations taking into account the multifunctionality of the existing agro-ecosystems and&#13;
thus the socio-economic parameters and interests of the local community. Integrated forest fire&#13;
strategies would be developed instead of total forest fire prevention by exclusion. Rural and&#13;
community development activities would be undertaken and support for the establishment of&#13;
rural micro-enterprises would be provided in order to motivate the local populations to&#13;
adequately manage and develop the rural environment. Improved carbonization, reaching 30%&#13;
efficiency, would be introduced. All these actions together would reduce losse in carbon&#13;
sequestration capacity and in biodiversity and would result in zero net CO2 emission from the&#13;
woodfuels-related activities in the project area. Institutional development of and capacity&#13;
building at the governmental agencies and community structures would also be included to&#13;
support sustainability and proliferation of the project's achievements after the completion of its&#13;
implementation. Monitoring activities would be implemented to evaluate the effects and, if&#13;
necessary, to adjust management strategies.&#13;
Costs&#13;
7.    The difference in cost of the project between the Baseline and GEF Alternative scenarios&#13;
is US $4.66 million for the implementation of activities related to community-participatory&#13;
activities, integrated natural resources management, improved carbonization and monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of global environmental benefits of the project. Table 1 presents a summary of the&#13;
cost of project under the Baseline and GEF Alternative scenarios.&#13;

Costs Effectiveness&#13;
8.     It is estimated that over the project duration of 7 years the GEF Alternative Scenario&#13;
would achieve a total CO2 emission abatement of 1.1 million tons at a unit abatement cost of&#13;
US $4.30/ t CO2. Over 15 years, the GEF Alternative scenario would result in a CO2 emission&#13;
abatement of 4.5 million tons at a unit abatement cost of US $1.04/t CO2.&#13;
Additional Domestic Benefits&#13;
9.     In addition to a direct transfer of welfare to the rural communities resulting from the&#13;
management and commercial exploitation of woodfuels, it is expected that the rural population&#13;
will be able to obtain additional benefits and revenues from other activities such as Agroforestry,&#13;
livestock keeping and exploitation of non-fuelwood forest products. While quantification in&#13;
monetary terms is not possible, the protection and maintenance of the Niokolo-Koba National&#13;
Park would enhance the country's and the project area eco-tourism prospects.&#13;

CO2 emission abatement&#13;
10.    Under the Business-as-Usual Scenario (clear-cut followed by grazing, crop growing&#13;
and/or continuous subsistence wood collection) no forest re-growth would occur. Therefore, the&#13;
net emission of CO2 would equal the total amount emitted by the burning of wood harvested&#13;
(100% of CO2 emission level). The Baseline Scenario (sustainable forest management achieving&#13;
only 50% of sustainability) would result in a net CO2 emission level of 50% during the life of&#13;
the project.1 The GEF Alternative Scenario (achieving 100% forest regeneration during and&#13;
after project implementation) would result in a zero net CO2 emission level.&#13;
11.    The productivity of the savanna woodlands in the area is estimated at 30 m3 of fresh&#13;
wood per ha equaling 15 ton of fuelwood.2 Under effectively sustainable forest management, I&#13;
ton of fuelwood/ha/year can be harvested.3 This is the harvest intensity simulated under the GEF&#13;
Alternative Scenario. For the Business-as-Usual Scenario and the Baseline Scenario an annual&#13;
harvest intensity of 1.7 t/ha is simulated in order to arrive at an equal amount of charcoal&#13;
production in each of the different scenarios, given a carbonization efficiency of 30% 4 in the&#13;
GEF Alternative Scenario and of 18% s in the other scenarios. Thus, the comparison of the&#13;
Although it is expected that at the end of the project (year 7) it would gradually revert to the 100%&#13;
non-sustainability, a sustainability level of 50% was maintained throughout the 15 year period to&#13;
avoid complicating the analysis with additional assumption on the rate of reversal from 50%&#13;
sustainability to 100% non-sustainability. Factoring a gradual reversal to non-sustainability would&#13;
result in higher benefits for the GEF Alternative Scenario.&#13;

scenarios is based on differences in amounts of fuelwood harvested and the corresponding net&#13;
CO2 emissions resulting from varying degrees of forest management sustainability. The&#13;
amount of carbon sequestered in 1 ton of harvested fuelwood equals 1.7 t of CO2    The&#13;
impact of possible natural hazards such as drought, windstorms or diseases was not taken into&#13;
account.&#13;
12.   The total area managed during the implementation of the project increases as follows:&#13;
year 1: none (detailed studies and preparation of management plans)&#13;
year 2: 15 000 ha&#13;
year 3: 40 000 ha&#13;
year 4: 80 000 ha&#13;
year 5: 130 000 ha&#13;
year 6: 200 000 ha&#13;
year 7: 300 000 ha&#13;
13.   A comparison was made between these scenarios during the 7 year project - starting&#13;
wood harvest in the second year- and over 15 years. The 15 year time period was chosen&#13;
because it equals the period after which any fixed area in the region under an exploitation of I t&#13;
of fuelwood/ha harvested by clear-cutting without regrowth, would be totally clear-cut.&#13;
14.   For the sake of simplicity, this approach ignores the influence of the different scenarios&#13;
on the sequestration capacity of the forest ecosystem as a whole by not taking into account the&#13;
varying influences of selective logging and clear-cutting on aspects such as forest age, species&#13;
composition, underground biomass, soil condition, herbaceous vegetation, fauna and alternative&#13;
land use. However, since under both the Business as Usual Scenario and the Baseline Scenario&#13;
all forested land will finally be converted in either pasture or agricultural land, the GEF-&#13;
alternative Scenario would appear even more favorable on the long term in regard of CO2&#13;
emission abatement because the carbon sequestration capacity of forest land is generally much&#13;
higher than that of pasture or agricultural land.&#13;
15.   In summary, the approach has been very conservative for several reasons since (i) the&#13;
sustainable fuelwood harvest intensity of 1 ton per ha in the GEF-Alternative Scenario&#13;
represents the lowest limit within a range of 1 to 3 ton per ha., (ii) the Baseline Scenario is&#13;
maintained at 50% sustainability throughout the 15 years, while a gradual drop is expected after&#13;
the 7 years, (iii) the positive influence of controlled forest fires is not included, (iv) conversion&#13;
of forest land to pasture or agricultural has not been included and (v) no multipliers were applied&#13;
to account for expected positive influence on forest management in the whole districts of Kolda&#13;
and Tambacounda.&#13;
16.   Figure 3 presents the cumulative amounts of fuelwood harvested to produce equal&#13;
amounts of charcoal under the carbonization efficiencies of the different scenarios over the 15-&#13;
year period. The carbonization efficiency under the GEF Alternative Scenario is 30% and under&#13;
the Baseline Scenario and the Business as Usual Scenario is 18%.&#13;

degrees of harvest sustainability of the different scenarios over the 1 5-year period. The harvest&#13;
sustainability is zero in the Business as Usual Scenario, 50% in the Baseline Scenario and 100%&#13;
in the GEF Alternative Scenario.&#13;

project's Components I and II) between the Baseline and GEF Alternative scenarios is US&#13;
$4,660,000. This difference results from the implementation of: (i) technical activities design&#13;

management project and to include monitoring and evaluation systems and mechanism for the&#13;

1.    The Government of Senegal has long sought to promote the use of improved stoves.&#13;
However, it has been unable to make the use of improved stoves either operational or&#13;
sustainable. This is so because most stove programs implemented until now were run as Donor-&#13;
Government managed activities, which invariably collapse as soon as donor financing and&#13;
technical supervision ran out. As a rule, these projects worked on the basis of large consumer&#13;
price subsidies, whereby there was little long-term incentive for the private sector to produce&#13;
stoves outside direct donor financed pilot programs. When the cost of the expatriate technical&#13;
assistance is considered, it is estimated that the cost per disseminated stove elevates well beyond&#13;
the US $100 level. On the other hand, during recent policy analysis work (RPTES Program), the&#13;
Government reached the conclusion that a new generation of consumer-accepted improved&#13;
charcoal stoves (Sakanal, Diambar, etc.) exists and is already being successfully produced and&#13;
marketed at full cost by several NGO's in the principal urban centers of the country. Those new&#13;
initiatives are severely constrained in volume of operation (10,000 to 20,000 stoves/year) by a&#13;
lack of investment and working capital. Thus, lack of access to credit or other financial&#13;
instruments is the principal constraint to the successful market-based dissemination of the&#13;
promising new generation of improved charcoal stoves by small scale and micro-enterprises&#13;
and NGO's. GEF financing of this activity would contribute to the elimination of market&#13;
barriers.&#13;
2.     Within that context, the Baseline Scenario would be limited to the promotion by&#13;
Government of the improved stove concept within its general consumer education activities and&#13;
campaigns. No other investment or technical assistance activities would be carried out.&#13;
3.    Within an  "Environmentally enhanced" scenario - parallel to the GEF Alternative&#13;
scenario -- the project would promote for a period of five years (shorter than the life of the&#13;
project) the production and marketing of improved stoves by the private sector (small and micro-&#13;
enterprises) and/or NGO's at full factor cost by establishing a rotatory working capital fund (US&#13;
$ 300,000) for small and micro-enterprises and NGO's which have market-proven stoves but&#13;
lack the necessary resources to invest in the expansion of their production capacities.&#13;
Additionally the project would undertake basic monitoring and evaluation of the improved stove&#13;
programs and would set up a professional improved stove promotion campaign.&#13;
4.    Within the GEF Alternative scenario, a total of 225,000 improved charcoal stoves would&#13;
be produced and sold through the market during the first five years of the project. Stove&#13;
production and sales would reach the following cumulative schedule:&#13;
year 1:  2,700&#13;
year 2:  8,300&#13;
year 3: 25,000&#13;
year 4: 75,000&#13;
year 5: 225,000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3&#13;

5.    The CO2 emission abatement of this activity was calculated for the project period of&#13;
seven (7) years and for over a 15-year period (following the same standard used for the GEF&#13;
funded activities). The underlying assumption for extending that calculation to the 7 and 15&#13;
year periods is that once the project manages to "kick-start" the private sector/NGO based&#13;
production of improved stoves and the consumers have had a five year cycle of stove usage,&#13;
there would be a continuously increasing market demand for stoves, without the need for&#13;
continued governmental support. Based on the results of the evaluation of the 5-year program,&#13;
the Government will either continue to use the rotatory fund as such or will apply the funds&#13;
towards consumer energy education and awareness programs.&#13;
6.    The new generation of improved charcoal stoves reduces the consumption of charcoal by&#13;
1.6 kg per day per household. Burning 1 kg of charcoal equals the emission of 3.2 kg CO2. In&#13;
line with those assumptions, the implementation of the improved charcoal stove activity within&#13;
the GEF alternative Scenario would result in a n=t total CO2 emission abatement of 1.5 million&#13;
tons over 7 years and of 4.8 million tons over 15 years. Figure 5 presents the cumulative n=&#13;
CO2 emission abatement expected to result over a 15-year period from the implementation of&#13;
225, 000 improved stoves. It was assumed that a permanent park of 225,000 improved stoves&#13;
would remain in use by households through continuous reposition after the project target is met&#13;
at the seventh year of implementation. If the improved charcoal stoves result to be less efficient&#13;
than what has been estimated (and documented) thus far, the CO2 abatement benefit of this&#13;
activity may be slightly lower thar. anticipated.&#13;

Cost&#13;
7.    The total cost of the proposed 5-year improved stoves activities is US $500,000. This&#13;
cost would be divided between: (i) a research and analysis funds to review and evaluate private&#13;
sector and NGO investment proposals; (ii) a rotatory investment fund (US $300,000) to support&#13;
selected private sector/NGO initiatives; (iii) support to pilot sales and promotion campaigns (US&#13;
$100,000); and (iv) monitoring and evaluation of the impact of the improved stoves (US&#13;
$50,000).&#13;
8.    The difference in cost of the proposed demand management sub-components between&#13;
the Baseline and the enhanced scenario (US $500,000) is exclusively attributed to the&#13;
implementation of the improved stoves activities. Tables 4 and 5 respectively present a&#13;

PROJECT PARTICIPATION ACTION PLAN&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    For the past three years, the Government of Senegal, with the support of the World&#13;
Bank, has been in the process of formulating a traditional energy policy as well as identifying a&#13;
project to address its critical problem of rapidly decreasing traditional household fuel sources.&#13;
The process of both Policy Formulation and Project Identification has been participatory,&#13;
relying upon multi-disciplinary and inter-ministerial teams working on a consensus basis.&#13;
Further, a series of consultations with NGOs and the private sector representatives were held to&#13;
obtain comments. These significant activities have led to the development of the Senegal's&#13;
"Sustainable and Participatory Energy Management Project" (SPEMP) where participation will&#13;
play a vital role in attaining project objectives. To clarify the role of participation as well as the&#13;
participatory process and methodology to be utilized in the project, the following Participation&#13;
Action Plan (SPEMP- PAP) has been developed.&#13;
KEY ELEMENTS OF THE PLAN&#13;
* Based on a Consultative and Participatory Process: The foundation for the design of this&#13;
plan results from a consultative process of Policy Formulation and Project Identification&#13;
involving several key stakeholders. In addition, a series of National and Regional Participatory&#13;
Project Preparation Workshops were conducted by the Government of Senegal between&#13;
December 1995 and April 1996 to obtain feedback and suggestions from representatives of civil&#13;
society on the overall project strategy.&#13;
* NGO Oversight: The Government of Senegal will choose an NGO to be responsible for the&#13;
implementation and monitoring of the SPEMP-PAP. This "lead" NGO will be responsible for&#13;
promoting, monitoring and reporting on all participatory activities during the project&#13;
implementation phase.&#13;
* Phase of Preparatory and Support Activities: The entire first year of the project will be&#13;
dedicated to participatory preparation activities, as well as other support activities. The&#13;
participatory preparation activities will allow communities to design their own community&#13;
management plans as well as for the project team to obtain additional social, economic,&#13;
ecological, and functional information necessary for project implementation.&#13;
* Role of Women, Youth and NGOsi: Due to their critical role in resource management and&#13;
development, women, youth and NGOs have been identified as key participants and will play a&#13;
fundamental role throughout the lifecycle of the project.&#13;
* Participatory Methodology Training for Government Officials: General sensitizing of&#13;
government decision makers on participatory approaches and their impact on development is&#13;
planned as a key component of capacity building and institutional development activities for the&#13;
Government of Senegal.&#13;
INon-Governmental Organizations here also refers to Community Based Organizations (CBOs)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Background&#13;
2.     The SPEMP "Executive Project Summary" notes that "the government and the private&#13;
sector lack the financial and human resources that would be necessary to adequately manage the&#13;
country's forest resources".  Consequently, to obtain the project's objective (to meet an&#13;
important part of the rapidly growing urban demand for household fuels), it is necessary to have&#13;
2&#13;
the active involvement of the rural populations . For successful implementation of the project,&#13;
community involvement must be systematic and representative of all stakeholders. In an effort&#13;
to ensure systematic participation (participation that occurs in all stages of the project cycle,&#13;
influences design and implementation, and is appropriately institutionalized), the following&#13;
SPEMP - PAP has been developed. This plan, formulated in collaboration with the Government&#13;
of Senegal, is based on, in addition to other activities, a series of National and Regional&#13;
Participatory Project Preparation Workshops conducted by the Government of Senegal.&#13;
These workshops, involving over 60 community representatives and NGOs and conducted&#13;
between December 1995 and April 1996, gathered critical social, economic, and environmental&#13;
data which has improved the overall project strategy and enhanced the knowledge base of the&#13;
project team.3&#13;
Participants&#13;
3.     The recent Participatory Project Preparation Workshops identified women, youth, and&#13;
NGOs as key participants in the project. Special attention will be given to these groups,&#13;
however, not at the exclusion or marginalization of others. For example, Senegal's new&#13;
decentralization regulations identifies rural community councils as the statutory natural resource&#13;
managers at the local level. As a result, rural community leaders will also play a critical role in&#13;
the project.  Other essential participants will include charcoal producers, the private sector,&#13;
pastoralists, herders, bee-keepers, the government, and anyone else identified during the first&#13;
year of preparation activities. Contact with representatives of some of these key groups has&#13;
already taken place through the Project Preparation Workshops. Table 2 is an initial listing of&#13;
some of these contacts which will be built upon during the cycle of the project.&#13;

4.    In general, the participatory process to be followed during the project's lifecycle is&#13;
expected to be fluid and iterative, continuously adjusting to meet the needs of the project and its&#13;
participants. A "lead NGO" will be selected by the Government of Senegal to promote and&#13;
monitor this process.&#13;
2 "Rural populations" here refers to community populations, NGOs, and CBOs.&#13;
The National Participatory Project Preparation Workshops, held in Dakar December 1995 and March&#13;
1996, obtained advice and lessons learned from over 40 representatives of NGOs, the private sector,&#13;
and CBOs working in the Traditional Energy Sector throughout Senegal. The Regional Participatory&#13;
Project Preparation Workshops, held April 1996 in Tambacounda and Kolda, presented the project&#13;
proposal to its principal stakeholders - local populations. Comments and suggestions were solicited&#13;
regarding the proposed strategy from more than 80 representatives of NGOs, CBOs, community&#13;
leaders, the private sector, and local govermnment officials.&#13;

5.      A series of participatory approaches consisting mostly of Participatory Rural Appraisals,&#13;
consultative workshops, and social assessments will serve as the basis from which all else will&#13;
evolve. From the participation point of view, there will be three phases in this project:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
Participatory Planning and Preparation Phase (Year 1), Participatory Implementation Phase&#13;
(Year 2-7), and Evaluation Phase. The following provides greater details on the anticipated&#13;
participatory activities during these phases.&#13;
Participatory Planning and Preparation Phase: Year 1&#13;
6.    The first year of the project will serve as a foundation for the six years to follow. During&#13;
this critical year, a Project Implementation Plan will be defined in conjunction with the principal&#13;
participants, notably women, youth, rural populations, NGOs, CBOs, charcoal producers, the&#13;
private sector and the government. The following participatory activities, monitored by the lead&#13;
NGO, will result in the development of the Project Implementation Plan:&#13;
* Regional NGO Assessments: Studies will be conducted of NGOs working in the two&#13;
targeted regions, Tambacounda and Kolda, by an independent consultant or agency.&#13;
The results of these studies will illustrate the capacity of NGOs working in the&#13;
regions to participate in and promote and support participatory project&#13;
implementation.&#13;
: Organization of and Initial Implementation of Participatory Rural Appraisals:&#13;
Participatory Rural Appraisals (PRAs), conducted by NGOs or individual consultants,&#13;
will serve as the backbone for the Project Implementation Plan. The PRAs, in&#13;
addition to collecting necessary social and economic data, will allow communities to&#13;
prepare their own community management plans based on indigenous knowledge,&#13;
culture, and the existing resource base. At the end of the first year, this information&#13;
will be synthesized with technical findings obtained by the Government to formulate&#13;
technically, socially and economically sound community management plans.&#13;
Together, the Government of Senegal and the lead NGO will then consolidate these&#13;
community management plans into a detailed implementation plan for annual&#13;
participatory forestry management modules as well as for inter-fuel substitution&#13;
activities.&#13;
7.    Information collected from the PRAs will highlight themes and subjects which could be&#13;
useful in future PRAs or in other studies being conducted by the project. This information will&#13;
also be incorporated into the design of the following programs:&#13;
*  capacity building programsforfield agents and institutions;&#13;
* a monitoring and evaluation system; and&#13;
* a comprehensive communication strategy.&#13;
8.    During the first year, PRA facilitators will be selected. In addition, zones of intervention&#13;
for initial exploratory PRAs will be identified based on ecological, socio-demographic, socio-&#13;
professional, and administrative criteria. By the end of the first year initial exploratory PRAs&#13;
will have been conducted in each "arrondissement", covering approximately 15 communities.&#13;
This number will expand over the seven years, as illustrated in a later section of this plan, with&#13;
the increasing number of community managed hectares.&#13;
9.    Some of the participatory tools to be used in the appraisals may include semi-structured&#13;
interviewing, focus group discussions, preference ranking, mapping and modeling, and seasonal&#13;
and historical diagramming. These tools will reveal along with other information the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
- soil and land conditions&#13;
- land tenure practices and issues&#13;
- ecological, environmental and agricultural history, culture, and practices&#13;
- village community structures&#13;
- roles of community members (i.e. gender roles)&#13;
- livelihood analysis and variety of income resources&#13;
- wealth ranking&#13;
- important institutions and individuals in the community&#13;
- NGOs and CBOs active in the community&#13;
- NGOs and CBOs active in the community in the domain of natural resource&#13;
management&#13;
- important non-fuelwood products present in the forest&#13;
- location and practice of subsistence fuelwood collection&#13;
- community interest in natural resource management&#13;
- community interest in the project&#13;
- Community "Restitution" Workshops: Once the results of the PRAs have been&#13;
analyzed, "restitution" workshops to present and validate the findings will be held&#13;
with communities which participated in PRA.&#13;
* Regional Implementation Plan Workshops: At the end of the first year, Regional&#13;
Workshops will be held to brief community representatives and local administrative&#13;
officials on the Project Implementation Plan.&#13;
Participatory Inplementation Phase: Years 2-7&#13;
10.   As noted above, the six years of project implementation will see a gradual increase in&#13;
community participation as the number of community managed forests increases. Support&#13;
structures for participation will be established as well as the implementation of training and&#13;
capacity building programs.&#13;
11.   Participation: PRAs will continue to be the building block in designing community&#13;
management plans as well as evaluating existing activities and systems. The number of PRAs to&#13;
be conducted for planning purposes over the six year period is based on the number of&#13;
communities to be enrolled on a yearly basis. Table 3 is an estimation of yearly increase in&#13;
"planning PRAs" which will total 250 by the seventh year:4&#13;
4 ThiS table may change based on the demand by communities or other changes to the project design.&#13;

TOTAL       250&#13;
Additionally, "evaluative PRAs" will be conducted annually in selected communities.&#13;
12.   Issues raised in the first year of PRAs needing a more detailed assessment will serve as&#13;
the basis for a Socio -Economic Assessment to be conducted during the second year of the&#13;
project. This study will provide a more in-depth analysis of the targeted issues. Findings will be&#13;
incorporated where appropriate into the project and PRA design to reinforce activities.&#13;
13.   At the mid-point of the project, a Beneficiary Assessment will occur to assess views on&#13;
the project's implementation process and services being provided. This assessment will involve&#13;
various beneficiaries in urban and rural areas as well as service providers such as charcoal&#13;
producers, transporters, and the government to assess the initial impact of the project. This&#13;
information will feed into an overall mid-term evaluation report.&#13;
14.   Support Structures: To support the participatory process and ensure its representativity,&#13;
several structures will be established early on in the implementation phase. Some of these&#13;
structures will include:&#13;
* establishing or reinforcing communication mechanisms and collaboration systems in&#13;
the zones of intervention,&#13;
* establishing consultative groups which will foster dialogue between village&#13;
participants and the project team,&#13;
* establishing alternative mechanisms for conflict resolution and management among&#13;
stakeholders, and&#13;
* establishing a mechanism for monitoring and evaluating participation by local&#13;
populations&#13;
15.   Training and Capacity Building: Continuous training and capacity building of local&#13;
organizations and individuals will occur to further ensure sustainability. These activities will&#13;
take place in technical domains as well as in the areas of financial management, strategic&#13;
planning, monitoring and reporting, and participatory planning and management. In addition,&#13;
particular attention will be given to the training and sensitizing of government officials in&#13;
participatory approaches and their impact on development.&#13;
&#13;

Evaluation Phase: Year 7&#13;
16.    At the end of the project, a final independent evaluation will be conducted to assess the&#13;
impact of the project, its sustainability, and its participatory approach. Participating and non-&#13;
participating communities will be targeted in rural as well as urban zones. Within these zones,&#13;
representatives of all stakeholders (e.g. women, youth, NGOs, local elected officials, pastoralists,&#13;
herders, bee-keepers, charcoal producers, the private sector, the Government, and donors) will be&#13;
surveyed for their views on the process and impact of the project. The evaluation team will be&#13;
multi-disciplinary and its members independent, having had no previous involvement with the&#13;
project.   The team  will be comprised of an NGO  and Participation  Specialist, an&#13;
Environmentalist, an Energy Specialist, a Sociologist or Anthropologist with a focus on gender&#13;
issues, an Institutional Development Specialist, and Economist. With this diverse group it is&#13;
anticipated to obtain a broad as well as in-depth view of the project's results and impact. Upon&#13;
its completion, a french version of the evaluation report will distributed to all the project's&#13;
partners and made available at the Resident Mission.&#13;

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
General Context&#13;
1.     The economic evaluation of natural resource management activities and investments in&#13;
developing countries has been the subject of continued discussion during the last three decades.&#13;
The lack of consensus among economists on the subject stems primarily from the difficulties in&#13;
arriving at a proper valuation of the natural resources in question, delimiting the frontiers of the&#13;
systems and activities under analysis, and defining the objective function of the problem under&#13;
analysis.&#13;
2.      Unlike most post-industrialized countries, where there a well established market systems&#13;
and regulatory, public consultation and arbitrage mechanisms, developing economies are&#13;
generally characterized by imperfect markets (information, access, etc.), regulated pricing&#13;
schemes, and inter alia lack of public participation and consultation in natural resource&#13;
allocation decisions.1 The specific case of the forest resources in Senegal is a good example of&#13;
that situation. As a direct legacy of the colonial period all land and forest resources "belong" to&#13;
the national government. The government through less than transparent mechanisms has&#13;
historically assigned the rights to commercial forest exploitation to a limited number of&#13;
individual in detriment of the vast rural populations, which have until recently lost their&#13;
surrounding forest resources and related habitats without receiving any compensation for it nor&#13;
being able to participate in the decision process. Forest lands have been systematically denuded&#13;
for different purposes, such as, for the expansion of the agriculture frontier, the extraction of&#13;
precious woods, construction materials, woodfuels and medicines. Operating under the&#13;
assumption that those resources had no inherent economic value other than as processed inputs&#13;
or products and that belonging to the state there was no need to compensate rural populations for&#13;
their loss, forest resources have historically been valued at their direct cost of extraction,&#13;
processing and handling. Under that scenario, the ecological value of the standing forest stocks,&#13;
their social value and the value of their multiple economic linkages have been systematically&#13;
disregarded. Government agencies and individuals have operated under that scenario driven by&#13;
narrow political and financial interests, and have been able to do so for a long time because of&#13;
the lack of political representativity of the rural populations. Economic analysts, on their part,&#13;
constrained by lack of adequate information and quantifiable parameters, being pegged down to&#13;
1&#13;
A good illustration of the practical differences in economic valuation between post-industrialized and developing&#13;
countries is the comparison between the long standing discussion in the United States and Canada concerning the&#13;
logging industry and its implications on the habitat of the endangered Spotted Owl and the forest logging&#13;
industry in West African countries and their impact on the "endangered" rural communities. In the case of the&#13;
Spotted Owl, the direct financial interests of the logging industry (included owners, labors, related business,&#13;
etc.) have been successfully challenged over the years by the environmental and bio-diversity conservation&#13;
interests of a much wider social constituency across the two countries. In the case of Senegal, large scale clear-&#13;
cutting of forests by a handful of urban-based individuals (for the expansion of export agriculture, for&#13;
construction materials, extraction of precious woods and woodfuels, etc.) has taken place since the colonial&#13;
period with zero or near to zero consultation and or compensation to the affected rural indigenous populations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 2 of 36&#13;
classical evaluation techniques, and/or by being forced to define the frontiers and objective&#13;
functions of the problems under analysis in a very narrow sectorial basis, have frequently been&#13;
unable to contribute to the proper valuation of the resources.&#13;
3.     If an "economic" analysis of a forest resource investment has to be undertaken, it stands&#13;
to reason that the analysis must attempt to capture the society's value and not that of a small&#13;
interest group. In an economy where the market functions in a relatively open manner and where&#13;
all segments of society have representative participation in the process of making economic&#13;
decisions (through the price mechanism or through other regulatory and/or consultative&#13;
mechanisms) there would be little room to question classical welfare economics assumptions.&#13;
On the other hand, in an economy plagued with market failures and where the actual distribution&#13;
of welfare is extremely skewed, it is extremely difficult to agreed that the economic value of&#13;
standing forest stocks would be zero or anywhere near to it, as it has been frequently proposed.&#13;
When examples of such zero valuation are examined in more detail, however, one readily&#13;
realizes that more often that not that valuation was the result of the way in which the frontier and&#13;
objective function of the analysis where defined.&#13;
4.     If an economic analysis focuses strictly on the supply of woodfuels to urban markets and&#13;
either assumes that the forest resources are "stock resources"2 or that the prevailing woodfuels&#13;
price structures already account for resource conservation through "stumpage fees" or other&#13;
mechanism, then it would be possible to conclude that the financial costs of generating the&#13;
intended supply of woodfuels (extraction, transportation and marketing) are the central&#13;
parameters to account and that the real social value of the forest (not just to a few individuals) is&#13;
already included as a production cost. Under that approach, an analysis could further focus on&#13;
the cost of supplying a given volume of final useful energy (measured in terms of tons of oil&#13;
equivalent or other calorific unit) and, on that basis, compare the economics of woodfuels&#13;
supplies with other potential altemative energy sources.  Such an analysis would not be&#13;
appropriate for evaluating the proposed "Sustainable and Participatory Energy Management&#13;
Project" in Senegal because of the following principal reasons:&#13;
(i)  the supply of woodfuels to urban markets is the desired energy outcome of the&#13;
project, but doing so in an environmentally sustainable and socially equitable&#13;
manner is an equally important objective;&#13;
(ii)  there is undisputed evidence that the prevailing forest resource exploitation&#13;
schemes in Senegal are both ecologically and socially detrimental and non-&#13;
sustainable;&#13;
(iii) there is equally undisputed evidence that, at the scale at which forest resource are&#13;
being exploited in Senegal for obtaining woodfuels (mainly charcoal), the&#13;
resulting ecosystems degradation greatly affects other economic sectors like&#13;
2   Natural "stock resources" are defned as resources which are finite within a human realizable&#13;
timeframe. Fossil fuels are considered "stock resources" because although they have a natural&#13;
generation process their natural production function runs in the millions of years and hence any unit&#13;
consumed in the present would be irreversibly discounted from the existing stock. The economic&#13;
implication of that is that their valuation would only need to account for the societal preference of&#13;
consumption in time period ta vis-&amp;-vis time period to+,,.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annx 8&#13;
Page 3 of 36&#13;
agriculture, and that as rural ecosystems degrade rural poverty increases, there is a&#13;
loss of rural employment, and among many other impacts, an acceleration of rural&#13;
exodus (with the consequent exacerbation of urban social and economic conflicts&#13;
and costs);&#13;
(iv) given the current a foreseeable level of woodfuel consumption, the economy can&#13;
not possibly sustain large scale inter-fuel substitution programs based on&#13;
expensive imported fuels;&#13;
(v)  under the present system of exploitation resource costs and prices do not account&#13;
for resource regeneration nor for compensation to the rural populations. Defined in&#13;
that way, the proposed project can not possibly be evaluated either in its own&#13;
merits or compared to the alternative supply of energy from a narrow direct factor&#13;
cost perspective. Furthermore, if the now well accepted postulate that urban&#13;
development holds the key to future aggregate economic growth in the African&#13;
countries (and elsewhere) is factored into the analysis, establishing sustainable&#13;
rural woodfuel supply systems for the urban energy markets would provide a&#13;
stable and mutually beneficial rural-urban interaction market mechanism; and&#13;
(vi)  forest resources in Senegal are "flow resources with a critical zone'"3 and are&#13;
already being used above their natural inflow rate resulting in an implicit loss a&#13;
continued stream of quantifiable benefits (good and services) through time.&#13;
The Project Rationale&#13;
5.     The supply of woodfuels to the urban and peri-urban energy market in Senegal is based&#13;
on geographically concentrated and non-sustainable forest resource management practices (clear&#13;
cutting). Given the relatively low efficiency of wood-to-charcoal conversion (18%) due to&#13;
inefficient carbonization, total charcoal consumption is equivalent to 1.2 times the total&#13;
consumption of fuelwood. Charcoal is currently produced in the Kolda and Tambacounda&#13;
regions, some 400 km away from the principal urban (Dakar and Thies) and peri-urban markets.&#13;
6.     Until recently forestry legislation gave the Forest Service the exclusive prerogative to&#13;
assign commercial exploitation rights over forest resources nationwide. These rights were&#13;
historically given only to urban-based traders resulting in the creation of a vertically integrated&#13;
and oligopolistic industry with widespread corruption problems. Among other issues, original&#13;
annual charcoal exploitation quotas were frequently surpassed with the Forestry Service lacking&#13;
the manpower or monitoring mechanisms to adequately supervise and enforce them. It is&#13;
3   Natural "flow resources with a critical zone" are defined as natural resources which have a natural&#13;
regeneration function within a realizable human timeframe, but if their use rate is grater that their&#13;
natural regeneration rate (inflow rate) their become finite (stock resources) for practical purposes.&#13;
The economic implication of that is that when used within the critical zone (net depletion) their&#13;
valuation must include the forgone value of the lost regeneration and the resulting non-availability for&#13;
continued use through time. Compared to stock resources -- say woodfuels vis-a-vis LPG -- either the&#13;
valuation of the woodfuel (flow resources) has to be higher or the discount rate that it is applied to&#13;
them needs to be lower in order to reflect the loss of the continued stream of benefits through time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 4 of 36&#13;
estimated that out of the some 1800 legally registered "Exploitant Forestiers" only some 2Q&#13;
traders actually work and control the urban charcoal trade. The remainder registered traders buy&#13;
charcoal production licenses ("quota charbon") and resell them afterwards to the traders that&#13;
actually produce charcoal. As even the temporary expatriate laborers (Guinnean Fulbes,&#13;
"sourghas") employed in the cutting of the wood and the production of the charcoal are brought&#13;
in to the rural areas by the urban traders, it is estimated that much less than 5% of the annual&#13;
turnover of the charcoal trade (US $ 60 million) remains in the rural areas. The transport of the&#13;
charcoal, which represents close to 20% of the final cost structure of the charcoal, is provided by&#13;
independent trucking companies on a cash payment basis. Over the years, the operation of the&#13;
charcoal industry has resulted in: (i) the gradual loss of forest cover (approx. 30,000 ha/year) and&#13;
thus of the ecosystem's carbon sequestration capacity and biodiversity; (ii) the degradation&#13;
of the rural environment (particularly of the soils); (iii) the impoverishment of the rural areas;&#13;
(iv) an acceleration of the rural exodus; and (v) a massive transfer of wealth from the rural areas&#13;
to the urban areas. In addition to these negative impacts, it is anticipated that the Niokolo-Koba&#13;
National Park ("International Biosphere Reserve Patrimony", 9,130 kmi2), which is located in&#13;
the south-eastern corner of the Tambacounda and Kolda regions and which is a declared&#13;
national and international biodiversity patrimony and "Biosphere Reserve", will come under&#13;
threat of encroachment within the next decade, with irreparable biodiversity and ecological&#13;
consequences at the national and global levels.&#13;
7.     The organization of the urban and peri-urban fuelwood trade (520,000 tons/year)&#13;
resembles that of the charcoal trade but poses considerable smaller environmental and social&#13;
conflicts. The consumption of fuelwood in the rural areas (1.5 million tons/year) is largely&#13;
satisfied through sustainable subsistence practices (cutting of branches, selective felling of small&#13;
trees and collection of dead branches). Women and children play a significant role in the&#13;
collection of fuelwood. Rural consumption of charcoal is mostly limited to the areas where it is&#13;
produced and is normally traded by the producers for food and lodging at the local communities.&#13;
8.    Prect Objectives.   The objective of the project is to meet an important part of the&#13;
rapidly growing urban demand for household fuels, without the loss of forest cover and the&#13;
ecosystem's carbon sequestration potential and biodiversity. This objective would be met&#13;
through: (i) the implementation and monitoring of 300,000 hectares of environmentally&#13;
sustainable community-managed forest resource systems in the Tambacounda and Kolda regions&#13;
of Senegal, creating a protection zone around the Niokolo-Koba National Park (Biosphere&#13;
Reserve); (ii) the promotion of private sector inter-fuel substitution and private sector and NGO-&#13;
based improved stoves initiatives; and (iii) the strengthening of the institutions involved in the&#13;
management of the sector, and the promotion of the participation of the civil society (private&#13;
sector, academic institutions, and NGOs community) in the operation of the sector.&#13;
9.     Project Description.   The project consists of three components: Preparatory and&#13;
Support Activities, Sustainable Woodfuels Supply Management and Demand Management&#13;
and Inter-fuel Substitution Options.  The project design includes a series of activities to&#13;
ensure an effective participation of the rural population ("measures incitatives") and thus&#13;
guarantee the full achievement of the environmental sustainability objective of the project. The&#13;
project also includes specific monitoring and evaluation activities (forest exploitation and&#13;
wildlife) designed to evaluate the achievement of its global environmental objectives&#13;
(maintenance of carbon sequestration capacity, CO2 emission abatement and biodiversity&#13;
conservation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 5 of 36&#13;
10.   Project Benefits. The project is expected to: (i) sustainably produce some 860,000 tons&#13;
of fuelwood (equivalent to 258,000 tons of efficiently produced charcoal) over a six year period&#13;
and would establish a permanent system capable of producing more than 300,000 tons of&#13;
fuelwood (equivalent to 90,000 tons of efficiently produced charcoal or 27 percent of total&#13;
consumption) per year on a sustainable basis; (ii) reduce woodfuels-related deforestation in the&#13;
Tambacounda and Kolda regions by some 16,000 to 20,000 ha/year, and as a consequence&#13;
reduce net CO2 emissions by about 510,000 tons/yr and reduce the loss of biodiversity by the&#13;
establishment of sustainable forest systems and of a protective buffer zone around the Niokolo-&#13;
Koba National Park; (iii) generate employment and economic development opportunities in&#13;
250 rural villages in the Tambacounda and Kolda regions and including women in the&#13;
management and marketing of woodfuels and other related income generating activities; (iv)&#13;
generate during the implementation period more than US $10 million in direct revenues to 250&#13;
villages from the trade of woodfuels, and generate additional revenues to the communities from&#13;
related natural resource management and exploitation activities (agro-forestry, livestock keeping,&#13;
non-fuelwood forest products, etc.); (v) on a sustainable annual basis after the end of the project,&#13;
generate direct revenues in excess of US $3 million to the participating villages from the trade&#13;
of woodfuels, and generate additional revenues from related natural resource management and&#13;
exploitation activities; (vi) reduce CO2 emissions by 420,000 tons/yr. by the distribution of&#13;
225,000 improved charcoal stoves in urban areas; (vii) increase the availability and access of low&#13;
income households to more reliable and efficient charcoal stoves and to modem fuels; and (viii)&#13;
strengthen the planning, policy making and implementation supervision capacity of the&#13;
traditional energy sector institutions, while increasing the participation of the civil society&#13;
(private sector, academic institutions, and NGO's community) in the management and operation&#13;
of the sector.&#13;
Other Project Options&#13;
11.   With assistance of the Bank's Africa Regional Program "Review of Policies in the&#13;
Traditional Energy Sector - RPTES", a national inter-ministerial team conducted a 2-year&#13;
comprehensive review of the traditional energy sector in Senegal (fuelwood and charcoal),&#13;
including the evaluation of the principal inter-fuel substitution issues and options (kerosene and&#13;
LPG). Within that review, the regulatory, legal, pricing and fiscal frameworks of the sector and&#13;
the evolution of its structure and functioning were studied in detail. The RPTES review&#13;
concluded that given the country's present and foreseeable macroeconomic and socio-economic&#13;
conditions, Senegal will continue to depend on forest-based traditional fuels to meet the lion's&#13;
share of the country's urban and rural energy needs well into the next century. While ongoing&#13;
demand management (improved stoves programs and consumer education campaigns) and inter-&#13;
fuel substitution (LPG and kerosene) efforts need to be continued and improved to incorporate&#13;
the lessons learned to date, large increases of petroleum products imports cannot be sustained&#13;
because of budgetary constraints and because current low household income levels severely limit&#13;
the potential for widespread inter-fuel substitution at non-subsidized market prices. Within that&#13;
context, and until economic growth allows for such substitution to take place, the principal&#13;
challenge of the energy sector in Senegal will be to transform the existing non-sustainable&#13;
commercial woodfuels supply system into one capable of supplying woodfuels -- particularly&#13;
charcoal -- to the rapidly growing urban population in an sustainable manner.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 6 of 36&#13;
12.   Previous Government run efforts at demand management (improved stoves programs&#13;
and consumer education campaigns) and inter-fuel substitution (LPG and kerosene) have had&#13;
mixed results. Without a significant shift in policy to promote an active involvement of the&#13;
private sector in the expansion of interfuel substitution and demand management efforts at the&#13;
massive level required would be neither fiscally sustainable nor sufficient. At close to US $ 750&#13;
per ha4 forest plantation schemes have proven to be economically unfeasible though-out West&#13;
Africa. The possibility to open additional forest areas for commercial exploitation of woodfuels&#13;
has been evaluated and determined unfeasible due to the fragility of the forest stocks and the&#13;
economic cost of extraction. The proposed project will therefore concentrate on introducing&#13;
sustainable forest/natural resource management systems in the Kolda and Tambacounda&#13;
regions for the supply of charcoal and will support a shift towards private sector-based&#13;
promotion of improved charcoal stoves and least-cost interfuel substitution options.&#13;
13.    Within that context, there is clear agreement between the borrower and the project&#13;
participating donors that there are no other economically or technically feasible project&#13;
alternatives capable of delivering the intended outputs, benefits and developmental impacts that&#13;
the proposed is expected to deliver.&#13;
The Evaluation Methodology&#13;
14.   Within the general and country-specific framework defined above, a deliberate effort&#13;
was made to elaborate a simplified economic evaluation methodology yet capable of including&#13;
the inter-temporal social valuation of the forest resources, the distributional effects of their&#13;
exploitation, and the value of the benefits saved thought the introduction of sustainable resource&#13;
management practices and improved end-use energy technology and the principal measurable&#13;
global environmental benefits.&#13;
15.   Methodological disclaimer. As the only feasible alternative to the project is to do&#13;
nothing, i.e., to continue to exploit forest resources in an environmentally unsustainable and&#13;
socially inequitable manner in the exact same areas where the project would be implemented&#13;
(Tambacounda and Kolda regions), considerations of transportation or other marketing costs&#13;
were purposely excluded from the analysis. Fiscal impacts were also excluded from the analysis&#13;
because they are estimated to be negligible, if not further supportive of the proposed project.&#13;
Under the current woodfuels taxation system, actual collection of "stumpage fees" is less than&#13;
40%. The proposed project includes the strengthening of the control of woodfuel flows and is&#13;
thus expected to increase the actual tax collection rates. On the other hand, the project will also&#13;
introduce a differential taxation (50 percent reduction) favoring the proposed community-based&#13;
sustainable forest management systems. Hence, it estimated that the project will be either neutral&#13;
or will have only a modest positive impact on fiscal revenues. The option of maintaining flat&#13;
taxation rates to increase fiscal revenues was ruled out from the start as: (i) differential taxation&#13;
Data from plantation projects through-out Africa indicate a total cost range of US $ 450 to US $750&#13;
per hectare, where the higher end corresponds to projects within Sahelian edafoclimatic conditions&#13;
and the lower end to projects in East and Southern Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 7 of 36&#13;
is required to provide a price protection from non-managed woodfuel exploitation5; and (ii)&#13;
government collected "stumpage fees" are justified under the assumption that the tax collected&#13;
will be reinvested in the regeneration of the forest stocks. Since this is n=t the case in Senegal,&#13;
and through the implementation of the project the rural communities will be responsible for&#13;
assuring the sustainability of the resource, there is no rational economic justification to maintain&#13;
the same level of taxation for community managed and non-managed areas.&#13;
Project Components&#13;
16.    All three components of the project (Preparatory and support Activities Component;&#13;
Sustainable Supply Management Component; and Demand Management and Inter-fuel&#13;
Substitution Options Component) where included in the economic analysis as they are judged to&#13;
be necessary and integral elements of the proposed investment. No differential valuation&#13;
treatment was given to investments for productive (forest management, improved kilns,&#13;
improved stoves, inter-fuel substitution options, etc.) or non-productive sub-components (data&#13;
generation and gathering, institutional development, capacity building, social support services,&#13;
communication strategy, etc.).6&#13;
Evaluation Horizon and Project costs&#13;
17.    Because of the long-term  nature of the proposed project objectives and expected&#13;
impacts, a project evaluation horizon of 20 years was adopted. All budgeted costs during project&#13;
implementation (7 years) where included in the economic analysis of the project. From years 8&#13;
to 20 realistic continued implementation costs where assumed at approximately 10 percent of&#13;
year 7 costs, gradually decreasing at a relative rate of 10 percent per year until year 20. That&#13;
continued but phasing-out cost structure between years 8 and 20 was discussed and agreed upon&#13;
with the borrower. Table 1 presents the budgeted project costs by component and main sub-&#13;
components per year for the 20-year project evaluation horizon. Figure 1 presents the profile of&#13;
project costs by component.&#13;
18.    The implication of that cost structure is that the borrower recognizes that the subsequent&#13;
cost of maintaining the system that will be put in place will be much smaller than that of its&#13;
original introduction. The importance of that is that once the large up-front costs of institutional&#13;
development and capacity building (both of governmental and civil society) are met, subsequent&#13;
This has been widely agreed upon and implemented in several forestry/natural resource/energy&#13;
related Bank projects such as "Niger Energie II" and " Mali Energie Domestique".&#13;
6   Although it is normal practice to exclude non-productive components from economic analyses -- as it&#13;
is difficult to calculate specific economic returns on things such as institutional development,&#13;
capacity building, etc. -- in the case of the proposed project it was judged that those investments&#13;
could not be dissociated from the expected project outcomes. If such investments are made and the&#13;
project does not achieve its proposed objectives, they would amounted to an unequivocal&#13;
misallocation of scarce investment resources. In practical terrns, the impact of including all project&#13;
cost represent an added burden of proof for the overall merits of the project.&#13;

investment (follow-up projects) to further expand the total area under community management&#13;
should be much lower on a unit basis (per hectare cost) than what they are for this first project.&#13;
The unit cost of the proposed project is of the order of US $66.6 per hectare (including all project&#13;
costs).7 Subsequent investments should not amount to more than US $30 per hectare at current&#13;
price equivalence.&#13;
Project Benefits and Valuation&#13;
19.    While the proposed project is expected to result in a large number of quantifiable and&#13;
non-quantifiable impacts the methodology adopted conservatively limited the valuation to the&#13;
following expected project benefits:&#13;
(i) "sustainable" wood production: the benefit of the "sustainable" wood production&#13;
expected to result from the implementation of the sustainable and participatory&#13;
forest/natural resource management systems was defined as the net reduction in&#13;
deforestation (loss of forest standing stocks) in a comparison between an area under&#13;
sustainable management and an equivalent area under non-sustainable exploitation. A&#13;
concept of area equivalence was introduced to avoid an overvaluation of benefits as the&#13;
amount of wood output that would be extracted from a sustainably managed area (1&#13;
ton/ha) is not the same as from an area that is clear-cut (15 ton/ha). The equivalence was&#13;
thus calculated on the basis of the total expected wood output of the area that will be&#13;
placed under sustainable management at every year of the project and that wood volume&#13;
was converted to hectare under clear-cut rates. As the areas under management increase&#13;
from year 2 to 7 the equivalent non-sustainable areas were increased. For the areas&#13;
under non-sustainable management a realistic 20 percent natural regeneration rate was&#13;
assumed. The calculation of the net deforestation impact was computed as being the total&#13;
deforestation minus the natural regeneration in a area non-sustainably exploited&#13;
equivalent in wood output to the total area under sustainable management within the&#13;
project. The effect of that model was that as the total area under management within the&#13;
project scenario stabilized at 300,000 ha (sustainably producing an output of 300,000&#13;
tons of wood per year) an net deforestation of 16,000 hectares per year was accrued to&#13;
the non-project scenario. That 16,000 ha was the result of a total of 20,000 ha deforested&#13;
minus a 4,000 ha natural regrowth allowance. Over the 20-year project cycle the non-&#13;
project scenario resulted in a net total deforestation of 248,800 ha. By making that&#13;
area./output equivalence it meant that during the period of analysis both scenarios&#13;
(managed and non-sustainable) resulted in the same amount of wood production but the&#13;
whereas 248,800 ha of forest were lost in the non-sustainable scenario, the sustainably&#13;
managed scenario have conserved intact the original 300,000 hectares of forests.&#13;
Table 2.1, 2.2 and 2.3 presents the detailed calculation of the benefit of the&#13;
''sustainable" wood production including parametric variations ranging from sustainable&#13;
7   If only the costs of the supply side management sub-components are taken into account cost of the&#13;
implementation of community-based sustainable forest management systems would be of the order of&#13;
US $ 53/hectare. If only the direct field investment costs are taken into account the cost per hectare&#13;
would come down to US $ 35/hectare.&#13;

forest yields of 1.00 tons/ha to 2.00 tons/ha and producer price ranging from US&#13;
$15/ton to US $40/ton.&#13;
Since at the end of the 20-year horizon the total area under management still had a full&#13;
stock of 15 tons/ha (300,000 ha @ 15 ton/ha = 4.5 million tons of wood) which could be&#13;
maintained for continued sustainable exploitation or could be clear cut (or otherwise).&#13;
The benefit of the sustainable wood production was then valued at the current producer&#13;
price of wood of US $15/ton (base scenario). The producer price as opposed to the&#13;
current market price of wood was used because the final market price incorporates the&#13;
value added of transportation and marketing.&#13;
It is extremely important to note that the main driving parameter of the calculation of the&#13;
sustainable wood benefits -- and thereto of most other project benefits -- is expected&#13;
sustainable forest yield. Based on the most recent studies 8 it is expected that the&#13;
average sustainable forest yield in the Tambacounda and Kolda regions of Senegal will&#13;
be between I and 2.5 tons per hectare with a high provability of it being closer to 2.00&#13;
tons hectare than to the lower limit. In order to avoid any risk of overestimation of&#13;
project benefits all base calculation of the evaluation models were done using the lower&#13;
limit (1.00 ton/ha) as the valid parameter. The implication of this is that if the&#13;
sustainable yields prove to be higher, all project benefits which are directly related to or&#13;
pegged to the sustainable wood output will be automatically increased. If the actual&#13;
sustainable yield is confirm on the field at 2.00 tons/hectare, nearly all project benefits&#13;
will double ( see Tables 2.1, 2.2. and 2.3).&#13;
(ii) incremental charcoal production: the benefit of the incremental charcoal&#13;
production expected to result from the promotion of improved kilns was defined as the&#13;
additional charcoal that is expected to result from the a given amount of wood if that was&#13;
produced with the existing traditional carbonization technology (18%). The improved&#13;
charcoal kilns that have already been developed and tested in Senegal -- but which were&#13;
unsuccessfully disseminated in the past for accounted reasons -- is estimated to have a&#13;
carbonization efficiency of 30 percent. In order to avoid overvaluation of the expected&#13;
benefits the base calculations were made utilizing a 25 percent efficiency rate. The&#13;
economic value of the incremental production was calculated at the current market price&#13;
of charcoal of US $190/ton. It is expected that charcoal prices will rice through time,&#13;
thus resulting in higher a higher level of economic benefits for the same level of&#13;
incremental charcoal production. In order to avoid any risk of overvaluation of the&#13;
expected benefits, the base calculations were done at the current market price of charcoal&#13;
and the effect of higher charcoal prices were assessed during the subsequent sensitivity&#13;
analysis.&#13;
Table 3 presents the detailed calculation of the benefit of incremental charcoal&#13;
production for sustainable forest yields of 1.00 tons/ha to 2.00 tons/ha and charcoal&#13;
market prices ranging from US $190/ton to US $285/ton.&#13;

(iii) global environmental impacts: the benefit of the global environmental impacts&#13;
expected to result from the implementation of the sustainable and participatory&#13;
forest/natural resource management systems was defined as the expected net abatement&#13;
of C02 (in tons) and the conservation of bio-diversity in and around the project areas&#13;
(particularly in the Niokolo-Koba National Park and "international biosphere reserve)&#13;
and was valued at the US $ 1.01/ton per ton of net CO2 abated. The rational for that&#13;
was the value estimated for the CO2 abatement utilizing the GEF global environmental&#13;
benefits methodology and it corresponds to the grant funding provided by GEF for the&#13;
proposed project. That price is estimated to reflect the global social value of CO2&#13;
abatement. No specific valuation was given to the bio-diversity benefits but their value&#13;
is assumed to be included in the CO2 calculations. Table 4 presents the detailed&#13;
calculation of the global environmental benefits.&#13;
(iv) rural income generation and transfer: the benefit of rural income generation and&#13;
transfer expected to result from the direct sales of fuelwood by the participating rural&#13;
communities was valued at US $15/ton, which is the current estimated "road side"&#13;
laborer price of woodfuel in Senegal. While that current price does not include any&#13;
valuation for the resource, the economic value of the wood was already accounted for&#13;
within model by the "sustainable wood production" benefit (item i above). Also, while it&#13;
is expected that when the rural communities take over the "production" of the wood the&#13;
new producer prices will be higher, the current price was purposely maintained as the&#13;
base figure to avoid any possible over estimation of the expected benefits. Several&#13;
higher producer price scenarios were evaluated under the sensitivity analysis. Although&#13;
it is frequently done in projects of social interest, no additional income transfer&#13;
multiplier was added to the baseline calculations. Bank projects that compute income&#13;
transfers benefits to poor income groups estimate that multiplier value at between 30 to&#13;
50 percent.&#13;
Furthermore, it is important to note that as the community managed systems&#13;
mature it is expected that the communities will be able to engage in the direct production&#13;
of charcoal as opposed to limiting their activity to the cutting of the wood, whereby the&#13;
potential producer price to be applied would be that of the charcoal and not that of the&#13;
wood. The current producer price of charcoal is of approximately US $45/ton. At that&#13;
point, rural revenues will increase considerably.&#13;
Table 5 presents the detailed calculation of the rural income generation and transfer&#13;
benefits for sustainable forest yields of 1.00 tons/ha to 2.00 tons/ha, producer prices&#13;
ranging from US $15/ton to US $40/ton.&#13;
(v) "other" rural revenues: the benefit of "other" rural revenues expected to result&#13;
from the development of parallel agro-forestry production activities in the participating&#13;
communities was valued as a linear function of the total revenues expected to result from&#13;
the total sales of woodfuels by the rural communities. The rational for that was that as&#13;
the rural communities perceive an income from the sale of woodfuels they will have&#13;
income to invest in other productive activities. The project includes support mechanisms&#13;
and resources to assist communities which are prepare to invest their own resources in&#13;
other economic activities. As revenues from woodfuels increase through time (or under&#13;

the different parametric scenarios tested) the availability of community investment funds&#13;
for other activities will also increase resulting in increased revenues from those&#13;
activities. The relation between woodfuel revenues and "other" revenues where left&#13;
constant at 20 percent for the base scenario of the evaluation exercise but different&#13;
scenarios where tested.&#13;
The detailed calculation of the benefit from "other" expected rural revenues is included&#13;
in Table 5 (see item iv above).&#13;
(vi) charcoal saving: the benefit of charcoal saving expected to result from the&#13;
promotion of 225,000 improved charcoal stoves in the principal urban areas was defined&#13;
as the net saving expected to result from the use of improved charcoal stoves and was&#13;
calculated on the basis of the improved stoves produced by the project and expected to&#13;
be in actual use at each year during the project. The incremental energy efficiency&#13;
differential between the traditional and the improve stoves was estimated at 40 percent.&#13;
Based on the use of improved charcoal stove a family that today consumes 5 kilograms&#13;
of charcoal per day would need to consume only 3 kilograms. for the same final useful&#13;
energy service. That calculation took into account the annual rate of stove production&#13;
and a 3-year stove life cycle. The actual economic value of the charcoal saved was&#13;
computed at the current market price of charcoal of US $190/ton. As in the case of the&#13;
valuation of the improved charcoal kilns it is expected that as charcoal prices rise so will&#13;
the level of economic benefits from the use of improved charcoal stoves. The same&#13;
altemative price scenarios used for the charcoal kilns was used the charcoal stoves&#13;
benefits.&#13;
Table 6 presents the detailed calculation of the expected charcoal saving taking into&#13;
account expected annual stove production and dissemination patterns and stove life&#13;
cycles and valuates the benefits at charcoal market prices ranging from US $190/ton to&#13;
US $285/ton.&#13;
20.    As the full elaboration and quantification of other project activities (promotion of inter-&#13;
fuel substitution options, economic "reconversion" of charcoal traders, modernization of the&#13;
charcoal industry, etc.) will be done during the Preparatory and Support Activities component&#13;
(Component I) it was judged premature to make estimates on their respective possible benefits&#13;
(the full cost of those activities was however included in the project cost).&#13;
Discount Rate&#13;

economic evaluation of the project. According to these economic evaluation results, the&#13;
proposed project would be a fully justifiable and competitive developmental investment for&#13;
Senegal.&#13;
23.    From Table 7 it can be observed that over the 20-year evaluation horizon the project has&#13;
a total flow of US $21.3 million of costs and US $ 186.1 million of expected benefits, for a net&#13;
non-discounted positive cost/benefit flow of US $164.6 million. Figures 2 and 3 present the&#13;
project's expected cost and benefits flow and the net cost-benefit flow for the entire 20-year&#13;
evaluation horizon.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
24.    The selection of the key parameters for the sensitivity analysis of the project was made&#13;
on the basis of their relative weight within the total expected benefits and on the sensitivity&#13;
observed during the limited parametric variations included during the baseline evaluation of the&#13;
project's benefits (included Tables 2.1 to 6, above).&#13;
25.   From the total expected benefits calculated for the project the generation and transfer of&#13;
rural income accounted for 39.4 percent, incremental charcoal production for 33.5 percent,&#13;
sustainable wood production for 16.7 percent. "other" rural income for 7.9 percent and global&#13;
environmental benefits and charcoal consumption savings combined for 2.5 percent. Figure 4&#13;
presents a breakdown of the project benefits by type of expected benefit for the 20-year&#13;
evaluation horizon.&#13;
26.    From the above 5 key parameters were selected for the sensitivity analysis of the project:&#13;
(i) level of sustainable forest yields (0.5 - 2.0 ton/ha/yr); (ii) fuelwood producer prices (US $&#13;
10 - 30/ton); (iii) carbonization efficiency of improved kilns (18% - 30%); (iv) level of&#13;
"other" realizable rural income (15% - 40% of expected fuelwood sales); and (v) charcoal&#13;
market prices (US $ 190 - 360/ton). Tables 9.1 and 9.2 present the detailed calculation of the&#13;
sensitivity analysis for the five key parameter selected. Attachment A presents Figures A.1&#13;
through A.5 with the results of the sensitivity analysis for the five key parameter selected.&#13;
(i) sustainable forest yields: (0.5 - 2.0 ton/ha/yr): The most important parametric&#13;
variable of the project is the average sustainable forest yields. This is so because the&#13;
economic output of the sustainable forest management systems will depend on the&#13;
realizable sustainable forest yield. Expected rural incomes will depend firstly on forest&#13;
yields and then on wood producer prices. As the real forest yields are still based on&#13;
estimates a higher degree of uncertainty exists with respect to the forest yields than to&#13;
wood prices. Incremental charcoal production, "other" rural income and global&#13;
environmental benefits are all positively (and herein assumed linearly) correlated to the&#13;

actual sustainable wood output of the project, which in turn will be a direct function of&#13;
realizable average sustainable forest yields. Current information indicates that average&#13;
forest yields should be between 1 ton /ha/yr and 2.5 tons/ha/yr in the Tambacounda and&#13;
Kolda regions. While 1.0 ton/ha/yr was used as the baseline value for the forest yields,&#13;
the sensitivity analysis done accepted a yield range from 0.5 ton/ha/yr to the lowest&#13;
expected yield. Yields of below 1.0 ton/ha/year, however, are considered to be&#13;
unrealistic.&#13;
(ii) fuelwood producer prices: (US $10 - 30/ton). Fuelwood producer prices were&#13;
allowed to vary from US $10/ton up to US $30/ton. Scenarios for US $15/ton, US&#13;
$30/ton and US $40/ton were calculated as part of the baseline evaluation and are&#13;
presented in Table 5 (above). Because of that the sensitivity analysis was used to fine&#13;
tune the price range between the current US $15/ton and US $30/ton. Although a lower&#13;
producer price than the current US $15/ton is not expected to happen, a US $10/ton&#13;
scenario was also developed under a theoretical scenario that due to an unanticipated&#13;
sudden acceleration of inter-fuel substitution of woodfuels, their demand would drop and&#13;
thus potential future market-determined prices would come down..&#13;
(iii) carbonization efficiency of improved kilns: (18% - 30%). The carbonization&#13;
efficiency of the traditional charcoal kilns is rated at 18 percent. Because of that it is&#13;
expected that the lowest conversion efficiency of the improved kilns would be 18%.&#13;
Below that level of efficiency their use would be immediately and justifiably&#13;
discontinued in favor of the traditional charcoaling methods. Starting a 18 percent the&#13;
sensitivity analysis covered gradual efficiency variation until the 30 percent mark.&#13;
Efficiencies higher that 30 percent are considered unlikely under the expected field&#13;
operation conditions in the project areas. Higher efficiencies would be possible but a&#13;
much larger scales of operation than the one envisaged for the project.&#13;
(iv) "other" realizable rural income: (15% - 40% of expected fuelwood sales). This&#13;
parameter is a function of the income generated from the direct sale of wood by the rural&#13;
communities. While there is no empirical data in Senegal to substantiate a specific level&#13;
of relation between one and the other, the level used for the baseline calculation (20 %)&#13;
was chosen on the basis of estimates from project examples in Burkina Faso&#13;
(Programme National de Amenagement Forestier - PNAF and Programme National de&#13;
Gestion Terroir). Because of that lack of empirical data to back-up the estimation, the&#13;
level of the parameter was allowed to come down as low as 15 percent and go as far a 40&#13;
percent. Given the project preparatory work done directly in the field with the&#13;
beneficiary communities, it is expected that revenues from "other" economic activities&#13;
will play a significant role in the economic development of the project areas. In all&#13;
communities visited there are several initiatives for such parallel productive activities&#13;
and the communities intent to mobilize the project support mechanism for that purpose.&#13;
As the total share of this expected benefit over the overall benefits of the project is less&#13;
than 10 percent, even if the ratio between wood income to other income were to be lower&#13;
than the 15 percent allowed within the sensitivity analysis, it would not constitute a&#13;
decisive factor in the project overall evaluation rating.&#13;
(v) Charcoal market prices: Based on the production and marketing track record of the&#13;
improved stove that the project intend to support, there is no reason to believe that the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 36 of 36&#13;
stove dissemination targets of the project would not be met. On the contrary, it is&#13;
expected that the demonstration effect of the additional 225,000 that the project will&#13;
support will further motivate the development and/or expansion of additional parallel&#13;
private sector-based stove supplies at full factor cost. Also, while the long-term testing&#13;
done by Appropriate Technology International (ATI) has established that the DIAMBAR&#13;
stove has an incremental energy efficiency of 50% in order to avoid overestimation of&#13;
benefits the stove's incremental efficiency gain over traditional stoves was fixes at 40&#13;
percent. Hence, there being no expected negative variations in either the rate of stove&#13;
dissemination or the stove's energy efficiency, the sensitivity analysis of the improved&#13;
stove component was limited to variations in the market price of charcoal from US&#13;
$190/ton to US $360/ton. As the price of charcoal is only expected to rise over time, no&#13;
negative price variation were modeled.&#13;
27.   Table 10 presents a summary of the results of the sensitivity analyses conducted,&#13;
including the main value variations considered ("base", low and high) and the respective&#13;
switching value.&#13;

A- Obiectifs&#13;
1. Le Gouvernement du Senegal a mene de 1987 a 1992, avec le soutien de ses partenaires au&#13;
developpement, le premier projet sectoriel sur l'energie. Ce programme a permis de mobiliser les&#13;
financements necessaires aux rehabilitations les plus urgentes et pour le renforcement des&#13;
infrastructures. II a egalement contribue a ameliorer la capacite de gestion du secteur. Depuis&#13;
quelques annees, un nouvel environnement economique se met en place caracterise par la mise en&#13;
oeuvre d'un programme d'ajustement global de l'economie et de recentrage du r6le de l'Etat vers&#13;
les fonctions de planification / regulation / contr6le.&#13;
2. Dans ce contexte, un projet Energie II, reposant sur un programme de reformes importantes&#13;
dans le secteur de l'energie, est en preparation. L'objet de la presente" Lettre de Politique de&#13;
Developpement du Secteur de l'Energie " ( LPDSE) est de preciser les decisions prises par le&#13;
Gouvernement ainsi que le calendrier des actions pour leur mise en oeuvre. Elle s'inscrit dans le&#13;
cadre macro-economique defini par le Gouvernement, dont l'objectif est d'atteindre un degre de&#13;
croissance economique substantiel, tout en preservant la stabilite financiere et fiscale a moyen&#13;
terme.&#13;
3. Ce cadre a ete en particulier enonce dans le contexte des accords signes par le Gouvernement&#13;
avec les bailleurs de fonds internationaux. II est detaille, d'une part, dans le document-cadre de&#13;
politique economique et financiere (PFP) a moyen terme ( 1994-1997) et, d'autre part, dans la&#13;
lettre de politique de developpement du secteur prive, conclus en 1994 et soutenus par le Fonds&#13;
monetaire international et la Banque mondiale. Le PFP, remis a jour en 1995 et 1996 a defini les&#13;
actions generales que le Gouvernement a decide de mettre en oeuvre dans le secteur de l'energie.&#13;
Elles sont detaillees dans la presente lettre.&#13;
B-Cadre macro-economique&#13;
4. En termes d'objectifs macro-economiques, la politique d'ajustement global vise a atteindre une&#13;
croissance du PIB de 4,5% a 5% par an a partir de 1995 permettant chaque annee une&#13;
augmentation du revenu par tete de 2% au moins et la creation de 20 000 emplois nouveaux. Elle&#13;
doit en plus assurer, a partir de 1996, un retour du taux d'inflation, defini en terme de deflateur du&#13;
PIB, a son faible niveau de 2 - 3% par an. Elle doit permettre une reduction progressive du deficit&#13;
du compte courant exterieur (hors dons), de 9,8 % du PIB en 1994 a 6,8 % en 1997.&#13;
5. Le Gouvernement a mis en place un dispositif d'incitations et de securisation de&#13;
l'investissement prive qui comporte en particulier le Code des Investissements, l'autorisation de&#13;
rapatriements des capitaux et benefices, la legislation fiscale, la couverture des risques de&#13;
convertibilite des monnaies et de variation de taux de change.&#13;

C-SITUATION ET CONTRAINTES DU SECTEUR&#13;
6. Le Gouvernement a procede a l'analyse de l'ensemble des contraintes et obstacles auxquels est&#13;
confronte le secteur, a formule des orientations et des strategies adequates et a decide de&#13;
conduire des actions specifiques dans chaque sous-secteur energetique en vue d'atteindre les&#13;
objectifs globaux qu'il s'est assignes.&#13;
Cl-Constats d'ordre gin6ral&#13;
7. Le bilan energetique du Senegal fait apparaitre, au niveau de l1'nergie primaire, la&#13;
preponderance du bois (61%) provenant de l'exploitation des forets naturelles, suivi du petrole&#13;
(37%), celui-ci etant presque totalement importe.&#13;
8. Le niveau des prix est repute elev6 au S6n6gal en raison de contraintes objectives notamment&#13;
1'absence de rente hydraulique ou petroliere, la taille du systeme (liee a celle du marche) limnitant&#13;
les possibilites d'exploitation des economies d'echelle ou de recours a certaines technologies, et les&#13;
ressources forestieres limitees.&#13;
9. L'acces des populations aux formes d'energies commerciales est faible.&#13;
C2- Contraintes par sous-secteur&#13;
C2.1-Le sous-secteur petrolier&#13;
10. L'approvisionnement en hydrocarbures repose exclusivement sur les importations de la SAR&#13;
(Societe Africaine de Raffinage) qui s'elevent environ a 900 000 tonnes par an, representant un&#13;
cout d'environ en devises 75 milliards de F CFA en 1995, et 92 milliards en 1996. La SAR est&#13;
egalement la seule societe de raffinage de petrole brut. Elle est confrontee a deux problemes&#13;
majeurs: d'une part, la taille limitee du marche et, d'autre part, la vetuste des installations qui&#13;
tardent a 8tre renouvelees, ce malgre le "supplement" de 2,3 $/bbl qui lui est octroye au titre de la&#13;
remuneration de ses activites.&#13;
11. La production nationale est assuree par PETROSEN et represente moins de 1000 tonnes de&#13;
p6trole brut en 1995, vendu a la SAR et 55 millions de m3 de gaz qui alimentent des turbines a&#13;
gaz de la SENELEC. La principale contrainte de PETROSEN reste le financement de ses activites&#13;
dans le domaine de l'exploration, en particulier avec les difficultes de mobilisation de fonds&#13;
publics.&#13;
12. La distribution des produits petroliers est realisee par quatre grandes societes qui se partagent&#13;
le marche sans grande concurrence tandis que le transport des produits petroliers est assure depuis&#13;
1972 par un cartel de transporteurs affectes de fa,on reglementaire aux differentes societes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

13. La fixation trimestrielle des prix des produits petroliers basee sur la parite importation a&#13;
represente la premiCre etape de la reforme recommandee par l'etude du cabinet ADL de 1987.&#13;
Certains volets de la reforme tels que la repercussion du prix du marche sur le prix de vente au&#13;
consommateur n'ont pas encore ete entierement appliques. Par ailleurs, le poids de la fiscalite sur&#13;
le prix des produits petroliers, notamment ceux utilises par les industriels et le gas-oil, obere&#13;
lourdement le cout des facteurs de production compromettant ainsi la competitivite de l'economie&#13;
et la relance de la croissance.&#13;
C2.2-Le sous-secteur electricite&#13;
14. L'e1ectricite est uniquement d'origine thermique. La SENELEC a le monopole de la&#13;
distribution et dispose d'un parc de production de 280 MW. Elle consomme 300 000 tonnes de&#13;
produits petroliers pour une production de 1 000 GWh par an. Elle rachete en plus une part des&#13;
excedents d'energie (4 GWh en 1994) des quelques auto-producteurs existants (ICS, la CSS et la&#13;
SONACOS qui, avec un parc de 90 MW, produisent 100 GWh par an).&#13;
15. Le taux d'electrification au niveau national est de 25 % ; il est de 50% en zone urbaine et&#13;
seulement de 5% en zone rurale. La population n'ayant pas accbs a 1'electricite reste tres en&#13;
dessous du niveau mondial ( 75 % contre 40%)&#13;
16. En outre, le ralentissement a partir de 1990 des investissements de la SENELEC (dfi&#13;
essentiellement au gel des financements des bailleurs) a eu pour consequence la degradation des&#13;
outils de production et la deterioration des resultats economiques et financiers. Malgre le&#13;
redressement note recemment, les principaux problemes (deficit important de puissance, relations&#13;
financieres difficiles entre l'Etat et la SENELEC, faiblesse du taux d'electrification) persistent&#13;
toujours et leur resolution conditionne le succes durable des efforts d'assainissement engages.&#13;
C2.3-L'eIectrification rurale&#13;
17. L'electrification rurale est encore tres peu developpee- puisqu'on compte en 1994 environ 250&#13;
villages electrifies sur un total de pres de 14.000- a cause principalement de l'absence de&#13;
ressources adequates pour assurer le financement des coits tres eleves d'investissement et&#13;
d'exploitation dans un contexte de non-rentabilite financiere des operations d'electrification rurale.&#13;
Si la tendance actuelle se poursuit, le pourcentage de la population rurale ayant acces a l'lectricit6&#13;
ira en diminuant, dans la mesure ou le taux de raccordement (2% an) est inferieur a celui de la&#13;
croissance de la population (environ 3% an).&#13;
18. Le service de l'electricite en milieu rural est cependant source de progres social important; il&#13;
facilite notamment l'acces aux services de sante et a l'education, permet la realisation d'activites&#13;
productives generatrices de revenus et, d'une maniere generale, favorise le developpement&#13;
economique et social du monde rural. Ainsi, il contribue a freiner l'exode rural en fixant les&#13;
populations sur leur terroir, et donc limite le developpement incontr6le des villes. L'electrification&#13;
rurale represente, de ce fait, un enjeu considerable pour le Senegal.&#13;
II apparait donc fondamental de definir un cadre strategique global qui permette la mise en place&#13;
d'une veritable dynamique d'electrification rurale.&#13;
&#13;

C2.4-Le sous-secteur des combustibles domestiques&#13;
19. La consommation nationale est estimee a 330.000 tonnes de charbon de bois et a 1.500.000&#13;
tonnes de bois, ce qui represente l'equivalent de plus de 4 millions de m3 de bois. La demande en&#13;
charbon de bois, satisfaite par un prelevement concentre sur des ressources forestieres fragiles, est&#13;
a l'origine d'un d6frichement annuel de 30.000 ha de forets naturelles.&#13;
20. Les modes d'exploitation actuelles pour la fourniture du bois energie et du charbon de bois&#13;
conduisent a une degradation rapide du couvert forestier. Egalement, le front de 1'exploitation&#13;
forestiere recule d'annee en annee, pour atteindre aujourd'hui des zones situees a plus de 400 km&#13;
de la capitale. Enfin, la non-responsabilisation des populations locales ne permet pas une gestion&#13;
efficace des ressources forestieres de leurs terroirs.&#13;
21. La butanisation, menee depuis 1974 grace a un systeme de subvention sur le prix du gaz&#13;
butane et a des investissements prives importants en matiere d'equipement et d'infrastructures de&#13;
stockage, d'emplissage et de distribution, a aujourd'hui des effets visibles. Mais cette politique&#13;
s'est revelee etre d'un cout eleve pour l'Etat, atteignant actuellement 6 milliards de F CFA sous&#13;
forme de subvention sur le prix du produit sans compter l'exon6ration des taxes sur les&#13;
equipements gaz.&#13;
22. Enfin, les campagnes de promotion de foyers ameliores et de substitution de la tourbe au&#13;
charbon de bois ont ete sans grands resultats a ce jour.&#13;
D- Politique Energetiaue&#13;
23. Malgre les contraintes precedentes, le secteur energetique du Senegal presente des atouts&#13;
serieux pour son developpement, entre autres:&#13;
- une industrie petroliere complete fonctionnant selon des standards de classe&#13;
intemationale;&#13;
- un sous-secteur electrique organise de maniere rationnelle et recelant des ressources&#13;
humaines competentes, et;&#13;
- un sous-secteur des combustibles domestiques qui mise clairement sur une gestion durable&#13;
des ressources forestieres.&#13;
24. Dans ce contexte, la politique energetique mettra l'accent sur trois dimensions fondamentales:&#13;
economique: rationaliser les conditions d'approvisionnement, de production, de distribution&#13;
et de consommation d'energie, dans le respect des inter&amp;s a long terme du pays;&#13;
. environnementale : respecter les equilibres ecologiques fondamentaux et encourager une&#13;
gestion rationnelle des espaces ruraux dans les zones d'exploitation forestiere a usage energetique;&#13;
.......&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5                               Annex 9&#13;
Page 7 of 13&#13;
. sociale: elargir l'acces des populations aux formes modernes d'energie, condition sine qua&#13;
non de reussite de la lutte contre la pauvrete, de l'amelioration de la sante des populations, de&#13;
succes dans les efforts de reduction de l'analphabetisme, du developpement de l'agriculture, de la&#13;
promotion de la femme, etc.&#13;
25. La strategie comporte des actions dans le domaine des sous-secteurs petrolier et electrique&#13;
ainsi que dans celui des combustibles domestiques. Celles-ci- incluent en particulier:&#13;
- la liberalisation des importations, du transport et de la distribution des produits petroliers&#13;
ainsi que l'abolition de la convention speciale de la SAR et son remplacement par une surtaxe&#13;
temporaire et degressive sur les importations de produits finis;&#13;
- l'ajustement trimestriel automatique des prix des produits petroliers en liaison avec&#13;
l'evolution des cours internationaux;&#13;
- la modification du cadre legal et reglementaire afin de permettre un niveau eleve de&#13;
concurrence et d'encourager l'implication du secteur prive dans l'investissement et la gestion du&#13;
secteur de l'e1ectricite;&#13;
- la privatisation et la restructuration de SENELEC; et,&#13;
- le transfert aux collectivites locales de la gestion et de l'exploitation des ressources&#13;
ligneuses.&#13;
26. Pour mettre en oeuvre cette strategie et les actions correspondantes, le Gouvernement a&#13;
decide de s'appuyer sur deux nouvelles entites, a savoir: (a) un Comite Interministeriel de&#13;
Pilotage des Reformes du Secteur de l'Energie, comprenant l'ensemble des departements&#13;
ministeriels concernes et ayant la responsabilite de coordonner et de diriger la mise en oeuvre des&#13;
reformes; et (b) une Cellule Technique, composee de specialistes requis, qui sera chargee de&#13;
mener tous les travaux necessaires pour la conduite de ces reformes ainsi que de la preparation et&#13;
1'execution du Projet Energie II.&#13;
E-Sous-secteur des produits petroliers&#13;
27. Les activites de ce sous-secteur sont deja exercees pour l'essentiel par des operateurs prives,&#13;
mais sous un mode monopolistique. Les r6formes ont pour but de diminuer le couit des produits&#13;
en liberalisant totalement ces activites et en stimulant la concurrence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 8 of 13&#13;
6&#13;
28. Tous les segments de l'activite seront liberalises d'ici fin decembre 1997, par abolition de&#13;
tous les monopoles existants (importation, raflinage, transport et distribution). L'encouragement a&#13;
plus de concurrence se fera sur la base de regles applicables de la meme facon a tous les acteurs&#13;
de la filiere, et en ayant le souci de securite d'approvisionnement, de surete et d'environnement.&#13;
Les barrieres a 1'entree dans l'activite (capacites physique et financiere aussi bien pour&#13;
l'importation, le transport que la distribution) seront fixees et contr6lees par la puissance&#13;
publique. Elles devront etre fixees a des niveaux permettant la satisfaction des exigences en&#13;
matiere de securite, de surete, de transparence avec le souci de ne pas decourager de nouveaux&#13;
acteurs potentiels. Les importateurs auront la possibilite de regrouper leurs achats sur le marche&#13;
international, a travers des mecanismes specifiques a mettre au point, en vue de realiser les&#13;
economies d'echelle propres a la taille du marche senegalais.&#13;
29. Le Gouvernement adoptera, avant fin 1997, apres concertation avec les operateurs&#13;
concernes, les modifications legales et reglementaires permettant l'acces des tiers aux installations&#13;
existantes de stockage et de transport par conduites des produits petroliers. Cela concerne en&#13;
particulier: les statuts de la SAR; la publication des specifications des produits pouvant etre&#13;
consideres pour l'acces a ces installations et des conditions techniques a respecter pour cet acces;&#13;
la fixation, I'homologation et la publication par les proprietaires des installations de leur prix pour&#13;
le service rendu (utilisation par des tiers de leurs installations).&#13;
30. Avant la fin du mois de decembre 1997, la convention liant la SAR et l'Etat sera abolie et le&#13;
supplement de 2.3 US$/bbl accorde sur les prix ex-SAR sera supprime. Une taxe sur l'importation&#13;
des produits petroliers raffines sera instauree a partir du mois de decembre 1997. Le&#13;
gouvernement adoptera avant la fin du mois de juin 1997, en accord avec la Banque&#13;
Mondiale,un plan indiquant la duree de cette surtaxe qui sera degressive et limitee dans le temps.&#13;
31. Fiscalite et prix: Le but general des reformes dans ce domaine est que les prix refletent les&#13;
couits economiques. A plus long terme, lorsque l'ouverture du marche sera plus importante&#13;
(nombre plus grand et taille relative plus faible des acteurs), les prix seront completement&#13;
liberalises. Dans la periode intermediaire, ils continueront neanmoins a etre regules. La definition&#13;
et la mise en place d'une nouvelle structure des prix petroliers se feront d'ici la fin de decembre&#13;
1997, en tenant compte d'un certain nombre de principes et d'objectifs de calendrier:&#13;
(i) I'ajustement des prix ex-SAR et des prix aux consommateurs en liaison avec les variations&#13;
des couts, en particulier celui des produits a l'importation; cet ajustement se fera&#13;
trimestriellement jusqu'a la fin de 1998, puis mensuellement;&#13;
(ii) les prix actuels seront immediatement transformes en prix plafonds;&#13;
(iii) les marges seront exprimees en valeur (et non en pourcentage) aux differents niveaux de&#13;
la filiere (importation, distribution, detaillant), et tiendront compte des caracteristiques&#13;
techniques et des coat propres a chaque produit;&#13;
*.** ...* &#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 9 of 13&#13;
7&#13;
(iv) le systeme actuel de perequation du transport sera revu, en raison du nouveau contexte&#13;
de liberalisation, pour prot6ger les interets des consommateurs excentres et assurer la couverture&#13;
du territoire.&#13;
(v) la fiscalite sur les produits sera simplifiee et l'objectif de neutralite fiscale (par produit, par&#13;
type d'usage) sera recherchee;&#13;
(vi) les subventions concernant les combustibles pour la production d'electricite et pour la&#13;
consommation d'electricite de la Compagnie des Phosphates de Taiba seront elirninees.&#13;
32. En ce qui conceme l'exploration petroliere, la politique du Gouvernement vise a intensifier la&#13;
recherche d'hydrocarbures, pour augmenter les chances de decouverte de gisements exploitables.&#13;
Dans ce contexte, le Gouvernement et la Societe publique PETROSEN devront concentrer&#13;
seulement leurs activites sur la promotion du bassin sedimentaire s6n6galais; a cet effet, les textes&#13;
regissant la soci6t6 seront modifies et adoptes avant le 30 juin 1997.&#13;
F-Electricite&#13;
33. Le sous-secteur de l'electricite fait face a des enjeux considerables qui conditionnent, dans une&#13;
large mesure, le succes du programme d'ajustement. C'est la raison pour laquelle, le&#13;
gouvernement attache une grande importance au developpement de celui-ci.&#13;
34. Les objectifs principaux de la politique du gouvernement pour le sous-secteur de l'electricite&#13;
sont: (i) d'assurer la garantie de l'approvisionnement en electricite de la population et des autres&#13;
consommateurs dans les meilleures conditions de surete et de prix, compatibles avec la situation&#13;
&amp;conomique du pays; et (ii) d'accelerer l'dlectrification urbaine (60% en l'an 2000) et rurale (15%&#13;
a l'an 2000).&#13;
35. Le Gouvernement a conscience que I'atteinte de ces objectifs ne pourra &amp;re realisee sans,&#13;
d'une part, trouver les voies et moyens de perenniser les resultats encourageants obtenus ces trois&#13;
dernieres annees au niveau de l'amelioration de la gestion et des resultats d'exploitation, et&#13;
d'autre part, ameliorer de maniere substantielle l'efficacite et la productivite du sous secteur par&#13;
une large implication des operateurs prives. Cela necessitera une restructuration importante du&#13;
sous-secteur dont l'objectif est de: (i) confier au secteur prive la production et la distribution de&#13;
l'electricite; et (ii) promouvoir la concurrence a tous les niveaux possibles et compatibles avec les&#13;
caracteristiques du systeme electrique senegalais.&#13;
Fl- Cadre 2Cneral&#13;
36. Il est retenu d'introduire d'importants changements dans la structure de l'industrie electrique&#13;
et dans la propriete des moyens de production et de distribution de l'electricite. A cet effet, le&#13;
Gouvernement a decide la privatisation ci court ternie de la SENELEC. Par ailleurs, le&#13;
Gouvernement ne souhaite pas creer de monopole prive durable ce qui, el moyeni ternie, implique&#13;
d'introduire le plus possible de concurrence dans le secteur.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8                              Annex 9&#13;
Page 10 of 13&#13;
Dans ce cadre, il a ete decide de mettre en place un processus progressif de decouplage vertical de&#13;
la structure de l'industrie electrique. Les implications et les adaptations que ce processus&#13;
necessitera sur les lois existantes seront examinees et les modifications requises seront effectuees.&#13;
Le Gouvernement envisage egalement la creation d'une part, d'une Structure publique legere&#13;
chargee de l'lectrification rurale et d'autre part d'une Agence de maitrise de l'Energie.&#13;
37. L'introduction de la concurrence dans le secteur sera neanmoins limitee par certaines&#13;
contraintes, specifiques au secteur electrique senegalais (cf supra) et liees plus particulierement:&#13;
(i) a sa taille actuelle relativement reduite; et (ii) au faible taux de penetration de 1'electricite,&#13;
particulierement en zones rurales. Ces contraintes ont et considerees dans le processus des&#13;
reformes qui seront mises en place.&#13;
F2- Les reformes de la structure et de la propriete du sous-secteur electrigue&#13;
38. Pour atteindre l'objectif de moyen-terme qui est de creer les bases pour un cadre competitif&#13;
dans le sous-secteur, le Gouvernement a decide d'ouvrir toute nouvelle production au secteur&#13;
prive, notamment selon la formule BOO (Build, Own and Operate). Dans les localites deja&#13;
electrifiees, et A l'expiration des concessions pour la distribution, leur octroi fera l'objet d'une&#13;
procedure d'appel d'offres a des operateurs prives, des collectivites locales ou a des cooperatives.&#13;
Dans le cas des localites non electrifiees ce processus sera, autant que possible, egalement retenu.&#13;
39. Par rapport A l'objectif de court terme qui est d'ameliorer l'efficience de la societe, le&#13;
Gouvemement procedera a la privatisation immediate de la SENELEC, sur la base d'un appel&#13;
d'offres structure, en procedant au transfert d'une majorite des actions A un partenaire&#13;
strategique, au secteur prive senegalais et au personnel. Le partenaire strategique proposera dans&#13;
son offre, le niveau de participation qu'il souhaite detenir. Les responsabilites du partenaire&#13;
strategique en matiere de gestion de la societe ainsi que ses engagements en matiere de&#13;
developpement de 'electrification seront definis au travers notamment d'un nouveau cahier de&#13;
charges, et d'une nouvelle convention de concession.&#13;
40. Des son entree en fonction, le Partenaire Strategique devra introduire une comptabilite&#13;
distincte pour les trois segments de son activite a savoir:  production-P, transport-T, et&#13;
distribution-D. Toute nouvelle capacite de production jugee necessaire se fera par appel d'offres&#13;
aupres d'investisseurs prives: la SENELEC n'etant plus autorisee A developper son parc de&#13;
production.&#13;
F3- Cadre lezal&#13;
41. Le Gouvernement preparera avant la fin de I'annee 1997, une Loi sur l'electricite mettant en&#13;
place le cadre structurel et juridique dans lequel le sous-secteur devra dorenavant operer. Ce&#13;
cadre legal comprendra : (1) la structure et le mode de fonctionnement du secteur permettant&#13;
d'assurer le maximun de competition au niveau de la production et de la distribution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9                              Annex 9&#13;
Page 11 of 13&#13;
De plus la loi sur l'electricite explicitera les relations entre les differents acteurs; (2) le role de&#13;
l'Etat concernant la politique electrique, la planification et la regulation, en particulier en ce qui&#13;
conceme les principes de tarification; et (3) les modalites de fonctionnement de l'organisme de&#13;
regulation.&#13;
Enfin, cette loi devra tenir compte de la politique de decentralisation, mise en vigueur en 1997, et&#13;
du cadre futur de la cooperation regionale en matiere de production et de transport d'energie&#13;
electrique notamment au sein des pays membres de l'Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du&#13;
Fleuve Senegal, de l'Organisation pour la Mise en Valeur du Fleuve Gambie et de l'Union&#13;
Economique et Monetaire Ouest Africaine.&#13;
42. La mise en oeuvre de la Loi sur l'Electricite sera assuree par un organisme de regulation qui&#13;
devra etre cree et qui aura pour taches essentielles: (1) d'accorder (et de retirer le cas echeant) les&#13;
differentes licences d'exploitation (production independante, concessions); (2) d'interpreter et&#13;
d'appliquer les principes de tarification definis dans la Loi; et enfin (3) de definir les standards et&#13;
normes de fonctionnement du secteur electrique.&#13;
Ce sera dans un premier temps, un organisme gouvernemental situe au sein du Ministere charge&#13;
de l'Energie. Sa fonction operationnelle de reglementation sera effectuee par une petite unite&#13;
specialisee et comprenant un nombre tres limite de cadres.&#13;
Dans un premier temps, elle sera chargee de controler et d'approuver les processus d'appel&#13;
d'offres competitifs lances pour obtenir des capacites additionnelles en production d'electricite.&#13;
F4- Maitrise de V'Enerfie&#13;
43. Le Gouvernement du Senegal entend poursuivre et developper les efforts en matiere de&#13;
maitrise de l'energie avec pour objectif de reduire la facture vis a vis des produits importes, de&#13;
dimimuer les couits des facteurs de production et de contribuer a la protection de 1'environnement&#13;
global.&#13;
44. A cet effet, I'Agence pour la maitrise de I'Energie dont la creation est envisagee plus haut&#13;
aura pour taches d'identifier les potentiels d'economie d'energie et de realiser les actions&#13;
d'information, d'appui et de conseil aupres des differents operateurs. Elle etudiera d'autre part, les&#13;
mesures fiscales et reglementaires a mettre en place pour encourager la maitrise de l'energie.&#13;
F5- Electrification rurale et Oeriurbaine&#13;
45. Le developpement de 1'electricite dans les zones rurales et dans certaines zones peri-urbaines,&#13;
que cela soit par developpement des reseaux ou par moyens decentralises, est couteux et le&#13;
produit peut s'averer trop cher pour les populations concernees. Le Gouvernement envisage&#13;
d'appuyer ces extensions par l'octroi de subventions dans le cadre de sa politique sociale. Leurs&#13;
realisation et exploitation pourront etre confiees aux firmes de distribution privees les plus&#13;
proches des zones concernmes, selon des procedures d'adjudication reglementees.&#13;

46. Cet aspect devra faire l'objet d'analyses compl6mentaires et de propositions plus detaillees, en&#13;
particulier pour ce qui concerne la programmation des investissements, les sources et les&#13;
modalites de financement. Il est neanmoins attendu que la restructuration du secteur, telle qu'elle&#13;
est decrite ci-dessus, facilitera le developpement d'entites capables et interessees a d6velopper ces&#13;
activites.&#13;
G. Combustibles domesticiues&#13;
47. Le but general recherche est de: (i) valoriser de maniere durable les ressources energetiques&#13;
issues de formations forestieres nationales; (ii) faire beneficier les collectivites locales de&#13;
ressources tirees de l'exploitation forestiere, et (iii) promouvoir des combustibles de substitution&#13;
adaptes au modele de cuisson senegalais pour autant que leur faisabilite technique et economique&#13;
est assuree.&#13;
48. En vue de la realisation de ces objectifs, le code forestier, adopte en 1993 pour sa partie&#13;
legislative et en 1995 pour sa partie reglementaire, vise a introduire les reformes importantes&#13;
suivantes:&#13;
- le charbon de bois sera produit A partir de la vente de bois sur pied en consideration de la&#13;
capacite de regeneration des for8ts. C'est dans ce sens qu'un decret presidentiel pris en 1996,&#13;
vient de relever la redevance foresti&amp;e et introduit un systeme de taxation differencie suivant que&#13;
le bois provienne d'une zone amenagee ou de formations fortieres naturelles.&#13;
- les collectivites locales concernees seront les gestionnaires legaux des for8ts de leur&#13;
terroir et les beneficiaires des revenus issus de leur exploitation. A cet effet, les decrets&#13;
d'application de la regionalisation, dejA signes en janvier 1997, consacrent entre autres, le&#13;
transfert de la gestion des ressources forestieres aux collectivites locales.&#13;
49. Dans ce contexte, les dispositions legislatives et reglementaires du nouveau Code Forestier&#13;
seront revisees, avant le 30 juin 1997, pour tenir compte de la politique de regionalisation et pour&#13;
offrir des garanties en matiere de gestion de for8ts et de transfert des ressources issues de&#13;
l'exploitation forestiere vers les populations rurales.&#13;
50. Dans le cadre de cette revision, les mesures suivantes seront precisees:&#13;
1) les gestionnaires legaux des ressources concernees seront les beneficiaires des revenus&#13;
issus de la vente du bois des for8ts;&#13;
2) les quotas seront des quantites A prelever annuellement, fixees en terme de volume de&#13;
bois sur pied ou de stere, en tenant compte de la capacite de regeneration des for8ts&#13;
3) les services forestiers mettront en place avant le 30 juin 1998, les mesures necessaires&#13;
pour la realisation d'une exploitation forestiere raisonnee et contr6lee (quotas annuels) qui&#13;
devront couvrir l'ensemble des superficies forestieres du pays a l'horizon 2005. A l'an 2000, ces&#13;
mesures devront couvrir les regions de Tambacounda et de Kolda.&#13;

51. En outre, le prix de charbon de bois sera liberalise au plus tard le 31 decembre 1999. Un&#13;
systbme de regulation de la filiere sera cependant mis en place pour eviter des risques en matiere&#13;
d'approvisionnement et pour assurer une situation de reelle competitivite dans le sous secteur.&#13;
52. Un plan de suppression de la subvention sur le gaz butane sera adopte par le Gouvernement&#13;
au plus tard le 31 decembre 1997, pour tenir compte des contraintes financieres de l'Etat.&#13;
L'elimination de cette subvention se fera de facon progressive par tranches semestrielles et devra&#13;
8tre complete le 31 decembre 1999.&#13;
53. Enfin, le Gouvernement envisage la mise en aeuvre de mesures adequates en vue de diversifier&#13;
les combustibles de cuisson proposes aux menages. Il s'agira en particulier de promouvoir le&#13;
kerosene -- dont l'introduction comme combustible domestique sera entreprise avant la fin de&#13;
juin 1998 -- et valoriser d'autres ressources potentielles nationales.&#13;
H - Approche et movens a mettre en oeuvre&#13;
54. Le Gouvernement du Senegal a conscience que la mise en oeuvre de l'ambitieux programme&#13;
decrit ci-dessus demandera un effort substantiel, du temps et des ressources financieres. Le&#13;
soutien de la Banque Mondiale et d'autres bailleurs de fonds sera recherche.&#13;

            Senegal - Sustainable and Participatory
            Energy Management Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Sustainable and
            Participatory Energy Management Project is to meet an
            important part of the rapidly growing urban demand for
            household fuels, without the loss of forest cover and the
            ecosystem's carbon sequestration potential and
            biodiversity. The project will: (1) implement and monitor
            environmentally sustainable community-managed forest
            resource systems, creating a protection zone around the
            Niokolo-Koba National Park; (2) promote inter-fuel
            substitution and improved stoves initiatives; (3) strengthen
            the institutions involved in managing the sector, and
            promote the participation of the civil society (private
            sector, academic institutions, and nongovernmental
            organizations (NGO)) in operating the sector. The project
            will finance: (1) an assessment of vegetation cover, an
            assessment of dead wood and other preparatory activities;
            (2) community-based forest management activities; (3)
            promotion of rural-based micro-enterprises and private
            sector and NGO-based inter-fuel substitution activities; (4)
