1. THE ENERGY SECTOR&#13;
A. ENERGY SOURCES AND USES&#13;
1.01  The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is short of energy resources. It has&#13;
lignite, which is mostly used to generate electricity, and hydropower; which together are&#13;
sufficient to make the country more or less self-sufficient in electricity, though it&#13;
exchanges electricity with surrounding countries. There is also extensive use of firewood.&#13;
Altogether domestic energy sources are about 60% of energy supplies. The country&#13;
totally lacks oil, gas or high quality coal resources and as a result imports around 40% of&#13;
its energy consumption. Most of these imports are crude oil when the refinery is running&#13;
or petroleum products when the refinery is not running. There are also normally small&#13;
imports of coke for the steel mills and the country is just beginning the importation of&#13;
Russian Natural Gas. Over the period 1990-96 energy imports amounted to about 11-&#13;
16% of total imports depending on the strength of the economy and any build-up or run-&#13;
down of inventories which may be occurring.&#13;
1.02 The energy balances available for the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&#13;
concentrate on sources of energy and provide very limited information on energy use.&#13;
The table below shows the sources of energy for 1996. In that year about 41% of energy&#13;
was imported, mostly petroleum products. The main domestic sources of energy are: 1)&#13;
lignite, which is primarily used to generate electricity; 2) firewood, which is used&#13;
extensively by households for heating and cooking; and 3) hydropower. Hydropower in&#13;
1996 was about 4.8% of energy supply and 23% of electricity production (5.2x1o TJ).&#13;

B. ENERGY INTENSITY/CONSERVATION&#13;
1.03   The economy of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is more energy&#13;
intensive than most West European Countries, though not as energy intensive as those&#13;
countries which were members of the former Soviet bloc. For example the ratio of GDP&#13;
($) produced to energy consumed (kilograms of oil equivalent) is about 1.5 $/Kg in the&#13;
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia compared with 3-6 which would be typical of&#13;
Western Europe or 0.4-0.6 which would be typical of Eastern Europe. Energy&#13;
intensiveness in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is due to four primary&#13;
factors. First, the share of industry in GDP or GSP is relatively high, which is true of&#13;
most ex-socialist countries. Second, much of the industry is inherently quite energy&#13;
intensive including steel, non-ferrous metals, and cement. Third, the industries in the&#13;
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia use less energy efficient technology than their&#13;
Western counterparts. Finally, houses are poorly insulated.&#13;
1.04   Thus, the potential for energy conservation in the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia is substantial and has been recognized by the Government. As the economic&#13;
transition continues, companies are being privatized and budget constraints are becoming&#13;
harder for the remaining Government owned companies. As a result, industries are now&#13;
becoming very conscious of their energy costs and have developed a number of larger&#13;
energy saving investments. Financing of these investments, however, is a problem due to&#13;
the poor condition of the Macedonian Banking System and uncertainty about the long run&#13;
viability of some of the companies involved. In fact, these investments should generally&#13;
not be undertaken until it is clear that the companies involved are financially viable in a&#13;
market economy.&#13;
1.05   Also since 1988, the Government has had a modest program, administered by the&#13;
Ministry of Economy, to increase energy efficiency. This program consists of a&#13;
competition held twice a year, where enterprises compete to receive small government&#13;
loans on favorable terms for energy saving investments. However, most investments in&#13;
industry are too large for the above program.&#13;
C. SECTORORGANIZATION&#13;
1.06 The energy sector is currently largely owned by the Government, with the&#13;
principal sectoral companies being: the power company, Elektrostopanstvo na&#13;
Makedonija (ESM); the Skopje Refinery; the Skopje District Heating Company; and&#13;
Makpetrol (the petroleum products distribution company). ESM is wholly and directly&#13;
owned by the Government, while the majority of the shares in the Refinery and Skopje&#13;
District Heating Company are socially owned with a small share holding by the&#13;
employees. These socially owned shares are left from the previous SFRY self-&#13;
management system. They are owned by the Government, which can sell them, but the&#13;
companies are self-managing. Makpetrol, on the other hand, is now more than half&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
privately owned and is officially an independent company. Government controls over the&#13;
energy sector are shared by several ministries and differ somewhat between the various&#13;
entities. The key institutional relationships are as follows:&#13;
* The Council of Ministers sets prices of petroleum products and electricity and is&#13;
expected to approve natural gas prices. It makes top management appointments&#13;
for ESM and ratifies major investments by ESM.&#13;
* The Ministry of Economy has principal oversight responsibility for the energy&#13;
sector and reviews and approves the investment plans of ESM. It recommends&#13;
to the Council of Ministers the tariffs for electricity and petroleum product&#13;
prices, based upon the proposals of the interested companies. It will set natural&#13;
gas prices, subject to the approval of the Council'of Ministers. In the special&#13;
case of district heating prices, the Ministry can approve these prices without the&#13;
intervention of the Council of Ministers. It is involved in the selection of top&#13;
management for ESM.&#13;
* The Ministry of Development reviews and comments on major investment&#13;
plans, especially those of ESM. This review is mostly to see that the plans are&#13;
consistent with the overall investment plan of the country and with the country's&#13;
potential financing capacity from internal and external sources. It can also&#13;
review and comment on pricing proposals.&#13;
3 The Ministry of Finance can review and comment on pricing proposals and&#13;
reviews and comments on investments when Government Guarantees are&#13;
required for debt financing.&#13;
1.07    The general procedure in the sector to obtain approval for an increase in prices&#13;
(except for district heating, see above) is first for the sectoral company to submit a formal&#13;
request with a detailed explanation. The proposed price increase goes to the Ministry of&#13;
Economy for review with other Ministries commenting on it if they choose. After this&#13;
review, the request is sent to the Council of Ministers for action. This system has worked&#13;
satisfactorily in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, since the Council of&#13;
Ministers has generally acted responsibly. Moreover electricity prices, perhaps the most&#13;
important prices, are set under a loan agreement between the EBRD and the Government&#13;
to which the Council of Ministers has generally adhered.&#13;
-1.08 The Government needs overtime to privatize the sectoral companies (along with&#13;
most of the industry of the country). The first step has been taken with the recent&#13;
privatization of Makpetrol through a management and employee buy-out. The refinery&#13;
should also be privatized if that is feasible given its uncertain outlook. Less urgently, the&#13;
three "natural monopolies", the Skopje District Heating Company, ESM and the gas&#13;
transmission and distribution company should be privatized. As these companies are&#13;
being privatized the Government needs to ensure an adequate and transparent regulatory&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
mechanism and facilitate the development of competition especially in petroleum&#13;
retailing and in power generation. (See below.)&#13;
D. LEGISLATION&#13;
1.09    Two key pieces of legislation that affect the energy sector are the Energy Law&#13;
and the Law on Public Enterprises. The Energy Law, which has just been passed by&#13;
Parliament, establishes a basis for the operation of energy companies, though it is very&#13;
broad (covering all energy) and somewhat vague on important issues while very specific&#13;
on other minor issues. Nevertheless it clearly establishes the important principle that all&#13;
activities in the energy sector can be carried out by both public and private, foreign and&#13;
domestic individuals and organizations, though licenses would be required. Specifically&#13;
it allows these individuals and organizations to engage in production, transmission and&#13;
distribution of electricity as well as natural gas and petroleum. It also requires, inter alia,&#13;
the Government to establish and implement a methodology for setting electricity prices.&#13;
1.10 The Government, especially the Ministry of Economy, will be heavily involved in&#13;
drawing up regulations to implement the Energy Law. The Ministry is currently working&#13;
on a cost-based methodology for setting electricity prices, which it would implement&#13;
through a regulation approved by the Council of Ministers. It is also working on&#13;
regulations which would deal with the pricing system which ESM would use to pay for&#13;
the electricity it purchases from independent power producers ( IPPs) or the prices IPPs&#13;
would pay for using ESM's transmission network. This is important since there is&#13;
significant potential for IPPs both in the form of small scale hydropower plants and in the&#13;
form of cogeneration from industrial facilities. This potential has not, however, been&#13;
exploited and needs to be encouraged. This project therefore seeks to encourage IPPs by&#13;
reaching agreement with the Government that it will adopt regulations under the Energy&#13;
Law acceptable to the Bank governing the operations of IPPs by December 31,1998.&#13;
Furthermore, a GEF project is under preparation which would provide grant funding to&#13;
allow the development of two or three small hydropower sites to serve as pilot IPPs.&#13;
1.11 The Law on Public Enterprises regulates various aspects of these enterprises&#13;
including: 1) management, 2) statutes, 3) financial reporting, 4) regulations regarding&#13;
strikes, and 5) state control over public enterprises. Public enterprises are autonomous&#13;
organizations and can be organized as joint stock companies. If they are organized in that&#13;
manner they can have minority private ownership. They are also separate legal entities&#13;
which can own assets and have liabilities. They are to be financially independent and not&#13;
funded by the Government budget. They have a Managing Board, a General Manager&#13;
and a Supervisory Board. The Government appointed Managing Board is the chief&#13;
governing and decision making body of the enterprise. These provisions are consistent&#13;
with those in many other countries and do not pose any major issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. ELECTRIC POWE&#13;
A. GENERAL&#13;
2.01    Electricity is the most important form of energy used in the country with the&#13;
majority of the population using it not only for lighting and cooking, but also to a&#13;
significant extent for heating. Production of electricity in 1996 was 6.17 Twh with 4.73&#13;
Twh supplied by thermal power plants and 1.44 Twh supplied by hydropower plants -&#13;
mainly for peaking. Domestic consumption of electricity was 5.2 Twh and losses, most&#13;
of which were in distribution were .785 Twh. There were also small net exports. Of the&#13;
total consumption, 2.5 Twh or 48% were sales to households while the rest were sales&#13;
primarily to industry but also commerce and government. Of the total sales of electricity&#13;
to industry, around 1.5 Twh are at high voltage to the largest industrial companies. There&#13;
are 12 of these companies and they include steel plants, non-ferrous metals plants,&#13;
chemical works, the refinery etc. The rest of the industrial sales as well as sales to&#13;
government and commerce are at lower voltage. The system is winter peaking, due to the&#13;
use of electricity for heating, with a peak in 1996 of 1145 MW and a minimum load of&#13;
334MW.&#13;
B. BACKGROLIND&#13;
2.02    Consumption of electricity in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia&#13;
grew until the early part of this decade. Over the entire period 1970-1996 the growth rate&#13;
was 4.2%, while for the shorter period of 1983 to 1996 it was only 1.0%. During the past&#13;
several years, moreover, electricity consumption has grown very slowly as the country&#13;
entered a period of rapid economic contraction due to major external shocks - mostly&#13;
connected to the dissolution of the Yugoslav Federation. These included losses of annual&#13;
transfers from the central Government which had amounted to 5-10% of GSP, loss of&#13;
foreign exchange reserves totaling over $1 billion held at the Central Bank in Belgrade,&#13;
and the loss of export markets due to the economic sanctions imposed by the UN on the&#13;
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro). This was aggravated by the&#13;
Greek embargo in 1994-95 which disrupted trade. These factors lead to major&#13;
dislocations in the economy with a drop in GDP of about 30% between 1990 and 1995.&#13;
Electricity consumption, however, did not decline anywhere near as much as GDP in part&#13;
because of a shift towards use of electricity (which is domestically produced) and away&#13;
from petroleum products (which are imported) as the latter became less available and&#13;
more expensive. The economy hit bottom in 1995 and began to recover in 1996.&#13;
Moreover, electricity consumption began to recover even before the economy and rose in&#13;
both 1995 and 1996, by about 3% per year. Most of the increase in consurnption came&#13;
from households and other low voltage consumers, the latter consisting mostly of small&#13;
industries and commercial establishments.&#13;

C. FIMJURE DEMAND&#13;
2.03    Electricity consumption is related to the growth of the economy, but is also&#13;
impacted by external factors. Assuming the economy continues to recover and restructure&#13;
and there are no further shocks, a reasonable assumption for GDP growth might be&#13;
around 4-5% a year from 1998 to 2005. Initially electricity growth may tend to keep pace&#13;
with GDP growth as industrial output rises and household incomes improve. In the&#13;
intermediate term, however, electricity growth should be slower than GDP growth for at&#13;
least three reasons. First, the structure of the economy should shift away from heavy&#13;
industry especially metals, to lighter industry, agriculture and services and this shift&#13;
should accelerate over time. Second, the remaining heavy industry should become more&#13;
efficient in its use of electricity and energy due to the increase in energy prices, continued&#13;
enforcement of hard budget constraints and the impact of privatization. Finally, the&#13;
creation of a gas distribution system in Skopje , around the turn of the century, will shift&#13;
about 50,000 households mostly from electric heating to gas heating. It will also cause&#13;
some commercial and Governmental establishments to shift from electricity to gas.&#13;
While the exact size of this shift is unkmown, the creation of the gas distribution system&#13;
could reduce electricity consumption by around 0.5-.7 Twh. Taking these factors into&#13;
account ESM's estimates of growth for the period 1997-2005 of around 3-4% in the&#13;
nearer term slowing to 1.5-2.0% after 2002 would appear reasonable, though there are&#13;
significant uncertainties involved in all of the assumptions above, especially the GDP&#13;
forecast. ESM's forecasts are summarized in Table 2.2.&#13;

D. GEATINGCAPACI&#13;
2.04    Available electricity generating capacity in the country consists of 1431 MW&#13;
which belongs to and is operated by ESM, around 3 MW of hydropower capacity&#13;
belonging to irrigation organizations and about 39 MW of oil-fired cogenerating capacity&#13;
in four plants in the industrial sector (see Annex 2-1). This cogeneration capacity is&#13;
currently not in use. Furthermore, in order to settle its debts to ESM, Zelezara has given&#13;
ESM its cogenerating plant. ESM is considering converting this plant to natural gas and&#13;
putting it back into service. ESM's capacity (excluding the Zelezara plant) consists of&#13;
386 MW of larger hydropower plants, 40 MW of smaller hydropower plants and 1005&#13;
MW of thermal plants (see Table 2.3 below). One thermal plant, Bitola, dominates base&#13;
load electricity supply producing typically around 4 Twh or close to 70% of current&#13;
Macedonian electricity supply. The Mavrovo cascade, especially the Vrutok hydropower&#13;
plant, is the country's largest hydropower system producing about 0.5 Twh or a little&#13;
under half of the hydropower. This is overwhelmingly used for peaking purposes. The&#13;
major power plants are given in Tables 2.3 below.&#13;

2.05   Mjor Generating Unita. The major generating units in the country are described&#13;
briefly below.&#13;
2.06   The BITQLA power plant and adjacent mine is the biggest energy complex in&#13;
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. It is located close to the town of Bitola in&#13;
the southern part of the country. The power plant, with 675 MW of capacity, is a little&#13;
under half the generating capacity in the country, but typically supplies about 70% of&#13;
country electricity needs. This is because it: 1) is a base load plant, 2) uses local fuels&#13;
and thus is little effected by trade disruptions, and 3) is relatively new with good&#13;
availability. The power plant units were commissioned in 1982, 1984 and 1988 as&#13;
Russian units of 210 MW. However, at fairly low cost, the plant expanded them to 225&#13;
MW units. The adjacent open-pit mine, Suvudol, produces about 6 million tonnes of&#13;
lignite per year which mostly supplies the power plant. Lignite reserves at the Suvudol&#13;
mine are adequate to last about 20 years. The plant is generally in good condition and&#13;
well maintained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
2.07  The NEGOTINO thermal power plant, located close to the town of Negotino,&#13;
was constructed in 1978 and designed for two units of 210 MW each. The first unit was&#13;
completed in March 1978 and the second unit was never started. The plant was designed&#13;
to burn heavy fuel oil (9600 kcal/kg) but could be converted to natural gas (8000&#13;
kcal/m3) at low cost. For the past four years the plant was shut down due first to the lack&#13;
of heavy fuel oil (during the Greek Embargo) and then to its relatively high cost.&#13;
Currently it is on cold stand-by.&#13;
2.08 The OSLOMEJ power plant and lignite mine are located in the Western part of&#13;
the country and have been in operation since 1980. The mine produces about 1.1 million&#13;
tonnes of lignite per year which is used in the power plant which has one unit of 120&#13;
MW capacity. There is little potential for expansion at this time due to the limited life of&#13;
the mine.&#13;
2.09 The MAVROVO hydro scheme (also called Tito-Gostivar) is composed of the&#13;
powerhouses Vrutok, Vrben and Raven, the Mavrovo dam and reservoir and a network&#13;
of feeder canals to catch the water coming from the nearby mountains. The first power&#13;
house in line is Vrben at 12.8 MW. Water emerging from this power house goes into the&#13;
multi-year Mavrovo reservoir and then to the two power stations of Vrutok and Raven&#13;
that are supplied in series by the same penstock. The capacity of this hydro scheme is&#13;
182 MW, which is a little less than half of ESM's installed hydro capacity of 426 MW&#13;
(including the small plants). This hydro scheme typically generates around 500 Gwh&#13;
about 80% of which comes from the largest plant, Vrutok. Generation from this hydro&#13;
scheme is typically just under 50% of the hydropower production in the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and is used primarily for peaking purposes. The&#13;
powerhouses in this scheme were built back in the 1950's and need to be rehabilitated in&#13;
order to increase efficiency and reliability.&#13;
2.10  The GLOBOCICA hydro power plant is located in the southwest part of the&#13;
country on the Black Drim river, 22 km North of the town of Struga. It has been in&#13;
operation since 1965. Installed capacity is 42 MW and average annual output is around&#13;
187 Gwh. It also is in need rehabilitation.&#13;
2.11 The TIKVES hydro power plant is located on the Black River, not far from&#13;
Kavadarci. The two first units have been in operation since 1968, and units 3 and 4&#13;
since 1981. Total installed capacity is 92 MW, and average annual generation is about&#13;
185 Gwh. The plant is primarily used for peaking purposes, though it is also run when&#13;
irrigation water is needed downstream. Due to age, it is in need of rehabilitation.&#13;
2.12   The SPILJE hydro power plant is located on the Black Drim river downstream&#13;
of Globocica. In operation since 1969, its installed capacity is 70.2 MW and the average&#13;
annual generation is around 300 Gwh. The Derbar reservoir behind the Spilje dam has&#13;
moderate storage capacity and the plant operates both as a base load unit and for peaking&#13;
purposes. Again some rehabilitation is required.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
E. IRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUITIQN&#13;
2.13   While the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia was part of Yugoslavia, its&#13;
power system was part of Yugoslavia's electric utility association, JUGEL; which in turn&#13;
was part of the Western European Electricity network, UCPTE. Thus, ESM was not&#13;
designed to be a self sufficient utility but rather part of a regional (JUGEL) and&#13;
international system (UCPTE). It would still gain very significantly from being part of a&#13;
regional system and eventually re-establishing the physical link with UCPTE', which is&#13;
currently severed because of the Yugoslav Civil War. An embryonic and informal&#13;
regional system seems to be developing with Greece, Bulgaria, Romania, the Federal&#13;
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia all coordinating and exchanging power. However, a well developed, formal&#13;
system has not been established and in the short to intermediate term it is likely that the&#13;
the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's Power System will not be part of a larger&#13;
fully integrated electricity network and thus it will continue to need more domestic&#13;
reserve capacity to provide spinning reserves and frequency control. Thus the role of the&#13;
major hydropower plants, which provide peaking capacity, frequency control and&#13;
spinning reserves, is further enhanced.&#13;
2.14   The Macedonian Dispatch Center was also designed to function as part of a&#13;
regional and international system. More specifically it was one of the eight dispatch&#13;
centers in the republics and provinces of Yugoslavia which worked in conjunction with&#13;
the pool or Federation Dispatch Center in Belgrade, which in turn coordinated with&#13;
UCPTE. An energy management system (EMS), financed by the Bank (Loan 2338-&#13;
YU), was under construction for the integrated Yugoslav System when the Yugoslav&#13;
Civil War broke out. As a result of the civil war the integrated Yugoslav System&#13;
disappeared and now the Skopje dispatch center has to function in isolation. To do this&#13;
most efficiently it needs some additional hardware, software and telecommunications&#13;
equipment to improve control over and communication with the power plants especially&#13;
with the hydropower plants.&#13;
2.15   On the whole the Macedonian Transmission system is in acceptable condition.&#13;
The backbone of the system is the 400 KV line crossing the country from FR Yugoslavia&#13;
to Greece and which linked Greece to UCPTE. In total there are 256 Km of 400 KV&#13;
lines, 165 Km of 220 KV lines and 1500 km of 110 KV lines. A new transmission line&#13;
from Bitola to Skopje, financed by EBRD, has recently been finished.&#13;
2.16   On the other hand, the distribution system in the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia is overloaded. It was built some years ago and carries more electricity than it&#13;
was designed for. As a result, distribution losses, at 12-13% of distribution sales, are&#13;
I/Physically the link with UCPTE is severed in Croatia, as a result of the Yugoslav Civil War.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
quite high. It also needs rehabilitation starting with replacing some of the distribution&#13;
transformers.&#13;
F. ELECTRICIT  WPR-ICES&#13;
2.17   Electricity prices are set by the Government, but taking into account agreements&#13;
with the IFIs on this issue. More specifically electricity prices are set by the Council of&#13;
Ministers based on a request from ESM, through the Ministry of Economy. Under an&#13;
EBRD Loan to the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia a target pattern of real&#13;
electricity price increases in German Marks (DEM) has been established which is then&#13;
reinforced under the Bank's FESAC Credit. The Cabinet has generally adhered to these&#13;
agreements. Expressed in German Pfennigs, the average electricity price rose from 5.9&#13;
Pfennigs/Kwh in 1994 to 6.1 Pfennigs in 1995 and to 6.55 in 1996. While prices rose&#13;
about 10% in Denar terms in 1997, due to the devaluation of the Denar the average&#13;
electricity price in Pfennigs actually declined slightly. EBRD is concerned about this&#13;
since their covenant is to increase the price to 7.5 Pfennigs/Kwh and maintain it at that&#13;
level. This price (7.5 Pfennigs/Kwh) is 4.2-5.4 US cents/Kwh depending on the&#13;
Dollar/Mark exchange rate. While no study of long run marginal costs has yet been done,&#13;
based on ESM's relatively low operating costs (around 3.5-4.0 US cents/Kwh) and the&#13;
lack of need in the near term for additional generating capacity, it would appear that this&#13;
price of 7.5 Pfennigs is probably not far from long run marginal costs. ( See para. 4.05).&#13;
2.18    The Macedonian tariff system is consistent with principles of economic pricing&#13;
with differentiation by time of day, season, and voltage level and including capacity and&#13;
energy charges. It also avoids one mistake that is standard in ex-socialist countries. This&#13;
mistake is charging households and commercial establishments substantially less for&#13;
electricity than industry, even though it costs more to supply them. In the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia households and commercial establishments are in fact&#13;
charged more than industry. For example in 1996 the average price for electricity&#13;
supplied to the largest industries, that is industries that receive electricity directly from&#13;
the high voltage grid, was 0.93Dn/Kwh compared with an average price of 1.80 Dn/Kwh&#13;
for households.&#13;
2.19    Households/Poyety Electricity represents about 4-5%  of expenditures by&#13;
households in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. Almost all households are&#13;
connected to the grid and electricity is overwhelmingly used for lighting and is the most&#13;
common means of cooking. Electricity is less used for heating , with a substantial part of&#13;
the heat used by households being provided by burning firewood or in Skopje by the&#13;
Skopje District Heating System. While electricity is thus an important consumer item, the&#13;
Government has not felt it necessary to provide special subsidies in this area. Rather the&#13;
Government has relied on a social safety net consisting of redundancy payments,&#13;
unemployment benefits, means tested income support and pensions. The possibility&#13;
exists, however, that the Government might want to introduce a lifeline tariff system and&#13;
this would depend largely on whether the Government decides that a lifeline tariff&#13;
system would provide better targeting of subsidies to the very poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
G. ORGANIZATIONAL ISSUES&#13;
2.20   Role of Government. The power sector currently operates as a public monopoly,&#13;
with ESM as the principal entity. As such it is classified as a public enterprise and falls&#13;
under state control. The extent of state control is principally in the areas of investment&#13;
planning, management selection and pricing. These activities are spread over several&#13;
ministries and the Council of Ministers as described in para. 1.06 above.&#13;
2.21   Sector Organization. The Government of the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia, with the assistance of USAID, had a study undertaken of the organization of&#13;
the electricity sector. This study was done by Arthur Andersen and Bechtel and looked&#13;
primarily at the issue of whether the system should be unbundled or not. Their conclusion&#13;
was that given the very small size of the system and the dominant role played by the&#13;
Bitola power plant, unbundling is difficult and may not be suitable. These conclusions are&#13;
appropriate. The primary benefit from unbundling is normally the creation of competition&#13;
among power plants or groups of power plants to supply electricity. However, in the&#13;
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia there is one dominant power plant (Bitola),&#13;
which would set the price and there would be little competition. There does appear,&#13;
however, to be a useful role for IPPs in providing power and as benchmarks for gauging&#13;
the efficiency of ESM and Bitola. Under this project IPP's would be encouraged (see&#13;
para. 1.10).&#13;
2.22   Company Organization and Staffing. ESM has a General Manager, a Managing&#13;
Board and an Advisory Board. The General Manager or Chief Executive Officer is&#13;
appointed by the Government for a 4 year term. The Managing Board, which replaced the&#13;
Workers Council under the old structure, consists of 11 persons of which 7 are appointed&#13;
by the Government and four are Government approved employees of ESM including the&#13;
General Manager. This Managing Board is the chief governing and decision making&#13;
body of the enterprise. There is also an Advisory Board, appointed by the General&#13;
Manager to assist with the economic running of the enterprise and consisting of the top 7&#13;
officials of the company.&#13;
2.23   The organization, prior to downsizing included 8,626 employees. This number of&#13;
employees was too high for a utility the size of ESM, even taking into account the fact&#13;
that it mines its own coal. The company has now downsized under commitments in the&#13;
FESAC project. This downsizing eliminated about 600 jobs in non-core activities,&#13;
through spin-offs and layoffs, and another 400 jobs are being eliminated through early&#13;
retirements and restrictions on hiring.&#13;
Comparisons&#13;
2.24   The table below compares various performance indicators for the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's Power System with two of its neighbors, Thailand&#13;
and proposed Bank "Targets" for those indicators. The former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
Macedonia's system compares favorably with the "targets" in terms of losses ( due to low&#13;
transmission losses offsetting high distribution losses) and population served. The low&#13;
load factor relative to the "target" level, cannot be rapidly changed because of the high&#13;
household winter demand for electric heating. The return on assets needs to be improved,&#13;
but cash flow is substantially better than would be indicated by the low return on assets&#13;
due to a high level of depreciation.&#13;

H. INVESTMENINS&#13;
2.25 An investment program was prepared by ESM and endorsed by the Government.&#13;
This investment program includes two main categories; a) rehabilitation/ completion of&#13;
existing systems, b) construction of new capacity.&#13;
2.26   Rehabilitation and life extension of the hydro plants is given the highest priority&#13;
by both ESM and the Government. This is because the hydropower plants are generally&#13;
fairly old, older than most of the thermal generation capacity, and a significant part of&#13;
their equipment is wearing out or is now obsolete with spare parts difficult to obtain.&#13;
Furthermore these plants play a vital role in the Macedonian Power System, providing&#13;
peaking capacity, reserve capacity and frequency control. (See para. 2.13.) In addition&#13;
two other areas are in need of rehabilitation/completion. These are the Energy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
Management System (EMS) which needs to be completed and which, as was indicated in&#13;
para. 2.14 above, was begun under an earlier Bank Project and the distribution system&#13;
which is overloaded.&#13;
2.27   Based on ESM's demand forecasts new generating plants are probably not needed&#13;
for about 12 years though a lot of additional capacity may be needed in the second decade&#13;
of the next century. If only one unit at Negotino operates then additional capacity would&#13;
be needed by around 2003. If a second unit is installed at Negotino then a new plant&#13;
would not be needed until around 2009.&#13;
2.28   In the longer term, ESM has proposed to add additional hydropower capacity in&#13;
the form of dams with powerhouses on major rivers, primarily the Vardar and its&#13;
tributaries. These hydropower plants would be part of an overall development program&#13;
for the Vardar River and tributaries. These plants are, however, a very expensive way to&#13;
generate electricity - usually $1000 - $2000/Kw for capacity with limited generation&#13;
because of limited water supplies. While the hydropower plants have not been evaluated&#13;
in terms of a least cost plan, they would probably not be least cost based on their power&#13;
generation characteristics alone. Their justification, if at all, has to be based rather on a&#13;
cost benefit analysis of their multiple uses including generation, irrigation, flood control&#13;
and municipal water supply. This has not been done. Also since the Vardar river flows&#13;
2&#13;
into Greece, agreement would need to be reached with Greece on the use of the water.&#13;
(See Annex 2-1 for technical characteristics of proposed hydropower, candidate, plants).&#13;
I. RATIQNAFlOERB BINOLVMENT&#13;
2.29   The Bank's Countr Assistance Strategy (iCAS) for The Former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia ( Report 14379-MK) in 1995, recognized the importance of a&#13;
power sector rehabilitation project for the country. More specifically it identified&#13;
rehabilitation of infrastructure as one of the priority areas for Bank lending indicating that&#13;
"Bank financing would be targeted to investment projects aiming to arrest the&#13;
deterioration of key infrastructure (power, water supply)" and specifically mentions a&#13;
power project in this context. The Energy Sector Review for The Former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia (Report 15313-MK), was even more specific indicating that&#13;
rehabilitation of hydro-power plants and completion of the dispatch center had the highest&#13;
priority in the energy sector. Beginning the rehabilitation of the Macedonian distribution&#13;
system was also given a high priority. These views are completely in agreement with&#13;
those of the Macedonian Government which in both 1995 and 1996 assigned highest&#13;
priority to rehabilitation of the hydropower plants in order to prevent black outs and&#13;
brown outs.&#13;
2/ The SFRY had an agreement with Greece on the Vardar River, but this agreement does not necessarily&#13;
extend to former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
J. BANK EXPERICE IN THE SECTOR AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
2.30   This project would be the Bank's first project in the Energy Sector of the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. However, the Bank has done a large number of energy&#13;
and power projects in other countries. One of the major lessons learned is that the&#13;
conditionality must be simple and closely related to the project. Also the design of the&#13;
project should be simple with a limited set of objectives. In addition the Bank published&#13;
in 1993 a policy paper entitled The World Bank's Role in the Electric Power Sector.&#13;
Two of the most important recommendations were: 1) "Bank lending for electric power&#13;
will focus on countries with a clear commitment to improving sector performance;" and&#13;
2) "the Bank will ...support programs that will facilitate the involvement of private&#13;
investors." The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is a country which has a strong&#13;
commitment to maintaining and improving sector performance and thus a power project&#13;
is warranted. Also this project will help to open the Macedonian Power Sector to IPPs&#13;
especially to small independent hydropower plants (see para. 1.10).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.01   This project through rehabilitating hydro-power plants, completing the EMS and&#13;
starting the rehabilitation of the distribution system aims to achieve the following&#13;
objectives. First, increase the efficiency of hydro-power generation. This would result in&#13;
greater hydropower generation for any given amount of water and a resultant reduction in&#13;
system costs and a reduction in carbon dioxide emissions due to reduced thermal&#13;
generation. Secod, expand the generating capacity of the major hydro-power plants&#13;
through rehabilitation. This should enable the country to better meet its peak electricity&#13;
demands, help stabilize frequency and reduce the likelihood of brown-outs and black-&#13;
outs. Third, increase system operating efficiency through completion of a modem Energy&#13;
Management System (EMS) that would enable the electric company to optimize&#13;
operation of its power generation and transmission facilities thus reducing costs. Fourth,&#13;
begin the reduction of the high losses in the electricity distribution system.  Eifth,&#13;
facilitate the development of independent power producers (IPPs), with the initial plants&#13;
probably being mini-hydro power plants. Finally, facilitate the eventual reintegration of&#13;
ESM into UCPTE by improving its system controls.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.02   The project will consist of three components which are:&#13;
a) rehabilitation of the six largest hydro-power plants in the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia which represent 91% of the country's hydro-power&#13;
capacity;&#13;
b) improvement of the EMS for the electricity company including controls,&#13;
dispatch center and communications;&#13;
c) beginning the rehabilitation of the electricity distribution system.&#13;
3.03    Hydropower Plant Rehabilitation (base cost $31.6 Million equivalent). This&#13;
component would rehabilitate the six largest hydropower plants in the Macedonian&#13;
System. These are Globocica, Spilje, Tikves and the three power plants in the Mavrovo&#13;
Cascade ( Vrutok, Raven and Vrben). The investments are to replace worn out equipment&#13;
or totally obsolete equipment which is inefficient and for which no spare parts are&#13;
available. The rehabilitation of these plants is just getting underway with a Swiss&#13;
Government Grant of 5 million Swiss Francs for equipment for the plants in the Mavrovo&#13;
Cascade. This project would complete the rehabilitation of the plants. The Bank would&#13;
finance equipment and technical assistance as needed. It would also fund software and&#13;
measuring equipment for the dam safety unit in ESM. ESM in turn would finance some&#13;
equipment installation and limited strengthening/repairs of civil works. These repairs are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
limited repairs on a tunnel in the Mavrovo Cascade along with other minor repairs of civil&#13;
works in powerhouses and channels. The dams are generally in good shape but&#13;
depending on further studies some strengthening may be needed at the Mavrovo Dam&#13;
which would also be funded by ESM. No new civil works are required.&#13;
3.04   Energy Management System This component has three interrelated parts. First,&#13;
is modernization of the data acquisition and controls for the Power System, mainly new&#13;
remote control units and assistance with installing these units. The second sub-component&#13;
is completion of the dispatch center, hardware and software, which was begun under an&#13;
earlier Bank project for the Yugoslav Federation. The third sub-component is&#13;
improvement of ESM's telecommunications system.&#13;
3.05   Distribution This component is small and would just begin the rehabilitation of&#13;
the Macedonian distribution system, which has high losses. It is expected that this&#13;
component would consist largely of distribution transformers since in many cases the&#13;
current Macedonian transformers are overloaded. The complete rehabilitation of the&#13;
distribution system would require a second project. ESM has asked the Bank to consider&#13;
a distribution project for financing once the current project is under implementation.&#13;
C. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
3.06   The costs of the project are shown in Table 3.1 below. The costs for rehabilitation&#13;
of the hydropower plants were estimated by a Swiss Consulting Firm, Entreprises&#13;
Electriques Fribougeoises (EEF). These estimates were made in Swiss Francs and then&#13;
converted to dollars. Since much of the equipment is likely to be sourced from Europe,&#13;
the Swiss Franc cost estimates are probably more accurate than the dollar estimates.&#13;
EFF's overall estimates were similar to those prepared by ESM, though they differed&#13;
from ESM on various items. The costs for the Energy Management System (EMS) were&#13;
developed by an American specialist and ESM working together. These costs estimates&#13;
were prepared in dollars. The costs of the small distribution component are based on&#13;
ESM's recent experience purchasing transformers and were initially prepared in DEM.&#13;
The cost estimates are in line with international market based prices, but they are mostly&#13;
Swiss Franc or DEM costs converted at current exchange rates. If the dollar/Swiss Franc&#13;
exchange rate were to change sharply these cost estimates would have to be changed in&#13;
dollar terms. (The loan amount need not be changed significantly, however, since it is in&#13;
German Marks.)&#13;
3.07   About 71% of the project is for the hydropower plant rehabilitation with 19% for&#13;
the EMS and 10% for distribution. Contingencies of 12% for inflation and 6% for&#13;
physical costs were included. The inflation estimate is based on Bank forecasts and the&#13;
standard disbursement schedule shown in Table 3.4. The allowance for physical&#13;
contingencies is low because the equipment is mostly replacement parts or off the shelf&#13;
purchases. It is expected that ESM will fund all local costs. These are generally some of&#13;
the costs of removal of old equipment and installation of new equipment. However,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
minor civil works are included in local costs, primarily repairs of structures connected&#13;
with the rehabilitation of the Mavrovo and Spilje hydropower plants and a modest&#13;
amount for strengthening Mavrovo. The estimates exclude any import duties which&#13;
would be paid by ESM if due. However, it is expected that the Govenmment will exempt&#13;
this high priority national project from import duties as was done for the EBRD&#13;
Transmission project.&#13;

D. PROJECT FINANCING&#13;
3.08 The table below, Table 3.2, shows the project financing. The Bank would finance&#13;
the equivalent of $35 Million in foreign exchange for the project. In fact the Loan would&#13;
be a Libor-based single currency loan of 61.5 Million DEM. In addition to the Bank&#13;
Loan, $3.5 Million equivalent in Swiss Francs would be financed by the Swiss&#13;
Government, $0.4 million by a Japanese Grant and $12.8 Million by ESM. Foreign costs&#13;
are about 77% of the total project- with 23% local costs. ESM would finance all local&#13;
costs. No funding from IDA would be used, though the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia is eligible for IDA..&#13;

E. PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
3.09 ESM has some experience with international and Bank procurement due to its&#13;
involvement with Bank projects when it was part of the JUGEL System and due to a&#13;
recent loan from EBRD for the Bitola-Skopje 400-kV transmission line. Nevertheless,&#13;
this experience is quite limited. To mitigate the risk of delay this would pose,&#13;
procurement consultants are being selected and will be contracted prior to Board&#13;
presentation. (These consultants are being procured according to the Bank Guidelines&#13;
Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers, dated January&#13;
1997, including reviews of all documentation by the Bank.) These consultants, combined&#13;
with active Bank supervision, would strengthen adequately ESM's capabilities in&#13;
international procurement. All goods and services to be financed from the Bank loan&#13;
would be procured in ac.cordance with the Bank's Guidelines. Macedonian manufacturers&#13;
competing under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) would receive preference in&#13;
bid evaluation in accordance with Appendix 2 of the Bank's Guidelines for Procurent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits dated January 1995 as revised in January and August&#13;
1996.&#13;
3.10 Goods and services to be financed by the Bank include mechanical and electrical&#13;
equipment and materials for hydro turbine-generator modernization, 35-kV and 1 10-kV&#13;
switchgear, protective relays, computer hardware and software, fiber-optic cable, power&#13;
and distribution transformers, and various other pieces of equipment. These will be&#13;
procured in about 21 procurement packages, mostly through ICB. The majority of these&#13;
packages require the supplier to supply and install the equipment; though for a few&#13;
packages, where the Macedonians have extensive installation experience, the packages&#13;
are for goods only. For small hardware and software contracts, valued at less than&#13;
$100,000 per contract and amounting to no more than $0.2 million aggregate,&#13;
procurement will be carried out through International Shopping. Installation of Bank&#13;
financed items procured under goods contracts and minor civil works to rehabilitate the&#13;
Mavrovo Dam will be funded by ESM and carried out by ESM's own crews, or local&#13;
contractors following competitive bidding procedures acceptable to the Bank. About $3.5&#13;
million worth of contracts for mechanical and electrical equipment for the project being&#13;
financed under a Swiss grant will be procured under Swiss procedures. Table 3.3 below&#13;
shows the proposed procurement arrangements. Full details are given in Annex 3-1.&#13;

3.12   A General Procurement Notice for this Project was published in Development&#13;
Business Issue 470 of September 16, 1997. A procurement workshop for this Project is&#13;
planned after both the hydro-power plant consultants and EMS consultants have been&#13;
hired. It is expected that this workshop will occur in connection with the first supervision&#13;
mission for the Project.&#13;
F. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.13    The Bank loan will be disbursed for equipment (under supply and install&#13;
contracts) against 100% of foreign expenditures. It will also be disbursed for goods&#13;
against: (a) 100% of foreign expenditures, (b) 100% of local expenditures (ex-factory&#13;
cost) and 85% of local expenditures for other items procured locally. For consultants it&#13;
will be disbursed against 100% of the cost of consulting services. Expenditures incurred&#13;
after November 3, 1997, up to a maximum of US$ 850,000 equivalent (2.4% of total&#13;
loan), would be eligible for retroactive financing. These funds would be for advance&#13;
payments for equipment and consultants. The schedule of disbursements for the proposed&#13;
Bank Loan is summarized in Table 3.4. It indicates a disbursement period of seven years&#13;
from the approval date of the loan. This schedule is based on the Bank's "electric&#13;
power" standard disbursement profile for ECA. The physical completion of the project is&#13;
expected by December 31, 2004. The closing date of the proposed loan would be June&#13;
30, 2005.&#13;

3.14   Disbursement for all contracts for goods and equipment (under supply and install&#13;
contracts) above US$250,000 would be fully documented. All consulting contracts over&#13;
$100,000 (firms) and $50,000 (individuals) would be fully documented. All other&#13;
contracts will be disbursed against Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). The supporting&#13;
documentation will be retained by ESM, and made available for review by Bank&#13;
supervision missions and auditors. To facilitate the implementation of the project, ESM&#13;
will open and maintain a Special Account with the Central Bank or an acceptable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
commercial bank on terms and conditions acceptable to the Bank. The authorized&#13;
allocation of the Special Account would be (US$ 2,500,000 equivalent). At the start of&#13;
the project, the Special Account deposit will be limited to (US$ 570,000 equivalent) and&#13;
the remaining portion of the authorized allocation could be requested only after&#13;
cumulative disbursements reach a level of (US$ 3,400,000 equivalent). Withdrawal&#13;
applications for the replenishment of the Special Account should be sent to the Bank on a&#13;
quarterly basis, or when the balance of the Special Account is equal to about half of the&#13;
initial deposit or the authorized allocation, whichever comes first. These applications&#13;
would have to be supported by appropriate supporting documentation including a copy of&#13;
the monthly bank statement of the Special Account as well as its reconciliation with the&#13;
Special Accounts transactions. Agreement was reached that ESM would have the project&#13;
account and the Special Account audited and submitted to the Bank six months after the&#13;
end of each year. Agreement was also reached for ESM to submit audited financial&#13;
statements six months after the end of each year.&#13;
G. ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
3.15    Environmental Categoiy  In accordance with OD  4.01 (Environmental&#13;
Assessment), the proposed project has been assigned to Category B, since the project will&#13;
have little impact on the environment and the little impact it has will be generally&#13;
favorable. The project's main environmental impact will be to increase hydropower&#13;
production by about 13 Gwh. This extra hydropower generation will replace generation&#13;
which would have come from burning fossil fuels, either lignite or heavy fuel oil, both of&#13;
which create emissions of carbon dioxide and sulfur dioxide. Thus the additional&#13;
hydropower production will reduce slightly ESM's overall emissions of carbon dioxide&#13;
and sulfur dioxide.&#13;
3.16   There is a secondary environmental issue connected with the transformers in the&#13;
distribution component. The old transformers which will be replaced contain transformer&#13;
oil. ESM has agreed that the oil from these old transformers will be recycled or, if&#13;
possible, sent to the refinery for use. ESM reports that the old transformers and oils do&#13;
not contain PCBs. Furthermore, it was agreed that the new transformers and oils will not&#13;
contain PCBs.&#13;
3.17   An assessment of the safety of the dams was carried out by an independent dam&#13;
specialist. The consultant's assessment focused mainly on dam safety during exceptional&#13;
events in the following respects: (i) safety against overtopping; (ii) safety against&#13;
earthquakes; and (iii) safety against internal erosion. The assessment found no major&#13;
risks in any of these areas though some further analysis and testing were required on the&#13;
Mavrovo Dam since the phreatic line in the downstream shell appears to be high. This&#13;
testing has been completed and the analysis of the results will be undertaken this winter at&#13;
the University of Skopje and then reviewed by Bank experts. It is possible that this&#13;
analysis will indicate further strengthening is required at the Mavrovo Dam. During&#13;
negotiations agreement was reached with ESM that any further strengthening of&#13;
Mavrovo Dam which the analysis shows is needed, will be undertaken by ESM and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
completed by December 31, 1998. Agreement was also reached that ESM will maintain,&#13;
have inspected and ensure the safety of the four dams involved in the project (Mavrovo,&#13;
Spilje, Tikves, Globocica) under arrangements satisfactory to the Bank A review of the&#13;
Emergency Preparedness Plan for each dam was also conducted and found satisfactory.&#13;
However, a number of recommendations to further enhance safety, covering: review and&#13;
improvement of the dam safety regulations, supply of modem instruments and computers&#13;
for safety monitoring and analysis of information, and training of staff, have been&#13;
provided by the consultant, with the associated estimated costs, incorporated into the&#13;
project. Details are provided in Annex 3-2.&#13;
H. IMPLEMENTATION/LMONITORING&#13;
3.18   The Project Implementation Plan is provided in Annexes 3-1 and 3-3. ESM has&#13;
established a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) headed by a Director (Annex 3-3) with&#13;
the responsibility for project implementation. The organizational structure and staffing of&#13;
this unit have been reviewed by the Bank and the unit is ready to start implementing the&#13;
project with some technical assistance. Agreement was therefore reached to maintain the&#13;
PIU with its current structure until the end of the project. Moreover, it is important that&#13;
ESM engages the services of qualified and experienced consultants to assist in preparing&#13;
technical specification, bidding and contractor/vendor selection, and quality assurance.&#13;
ESM has selected the consultant to assist with the implementation of the hydropower&#13;
plant rehabilitation component and has issued bidding documents to an agreed short list&#13;
of consultants for assistance with the Energy Management System.&#13;
3.19   This project will be supervised and monitored closely by the Bank especially in&#13;
the first two years. Monitoring activities will include reports on the status of the&#13;
following performance indicators: project implementation, electricity prices, receivables,&#13;
hydropower production, hydropower capacity, and distribution losses. Agreement was&#13;
reached with ESM to report progress achieved against these performance indicators&#13;
quarterly. Agreement was also reachedfor a mid-term review in December 2000.&#13;

4. FINANCIAL ASPECTS&#13;
A. FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ESM&#13;
4.01    Table 4.1 below provides the highlights of ESM's financial performance over the&#13;
past four years. The company earns a modest operating profit. However, the company's&#13;
cash flow from operations (operating income plus depreciation) is quite good largely due&#13;
to the high level of depreciation. Furthermore, depreciation is adjusted quarterly for&#13;
inflation and thus increases regularly. However, for Macedonian accounting purposes,&#13;
the modest level of operating profits is then offset by non-operating factors leading to a&#13;
very small positive net income which is taxed.&#13;

3) Operating income plus depreciation, not accounting definition of net cash flow provided by operating&#13;

4) According to Macedonian Law not according to international accounting standards.&#13;
4.02    The relatively poorer operating results for 1995 were due to the very small&#13;
increase in average prices in that year in spite of significant inflation. Normally ESM has&#13;
different summer and winter tariffs with winter tariffs being significantly higher than&#13;
summer tariffs, which reflects the actual economic costs. In 1994, the company was&#13;
allowed to charge winter tariffs during the summer which increased average prices very&#13;
sharply. In 1995 this was not allowed and as a result the average electricity price&#13;
increased very little in spite of two significant tariff increases in the course of the year. In&#13;
1996 both winter and summer tariffs were increased.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
4.03   ESM has some non-operating income, mostly net interest income. According to&#13;
Macedonian Accounting Standards this non-operating income and the operating profits&#13;
are offset by various charges including a charge for future capital investments so that&#13;
reported income is very small. According to international accounting standards the&#13;
company is considerably more profitable, though financial statements prepared according&#13;
to international standards are available only for 1995 and 1996.&#13;
4.04   The generally favorable operating results depend heavily on the average level of&#13;
electricity prices. These have been increased steadily in order to meet the requirements of&#13;
the EBRD Loan Agreement and to be in conformity with the requirements under the&#13;
FESAC Agreement with the Bank (see para 2.17). In order to insure adequate funding&#13;
for this project and consistency with EBRD, agreement was reached with the&#13;
Government and ESM that within one year of the commencement of disbursements under&#13;
the loan electricity prices will be set in accordance with a methodology established under&#13;
the new Energy Law and the average price of electricity should be not less than 7.5&#13;
Pfennigs/Kwh or the price required to meet the financial covenants of para 4.08,&#13;
whichever is higher.&#13;
4.05   The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and ESM need to develop a long&#13;
run least cost electricity supply plan. No such plan exists currently and one is needed for&#13;
ESM's capital budgeting purposes, and to estimate its required funding. Also, such a&#13;
plan would be needed to determine long run marginal costs (LRMC). During&#13;
negotiations agreement was reached with the Government and ESM to prepare this plan&#13;
by December 31, 1999.&#13;
4.06   Qrleivakles  ESM has a receivables problem. At the end of 1994 accounts&#13;
receivable amounted to 1.8 billion Denars, about 25% of revenues. This is after the&#13;
company wrote-off 733 million Denars in bad debts during the course of that year. These&#13;
receivables are almost wholly owed by state owned enterprises. Households&#13;
overwhelmingly pay their bills. In 1995 ESM received payment for most (581 Million&#13;
Denars) of the bad debt that it had written off in 1994 in the form of shares in the&#13;
enterprises which are not paying their bills. This is clearly better than not receiving&#13;
anything but not as good as cash since the value of these shares is uncertain and there is&#13;
no ready market for them. Moreover, at the end of 1995 accounts receivable had risen to&#13;
2.5 Billion Denars or 31% of revenues, which excludes the shares. This same general&#13;
pattern was maintained in 1996. Share holdings rose another 200 million Denars. Also,&#13;
ESM's accounts receivable rose to 3.4 Billion Denars ( 34% of revenues) according to&#13;
Macedonian accounting standards (where bad and doubtful debts can be written off only&#13;
with court permission and after suing the debtors). However, for the 1996 financial&#13;
statements produced according to international standards, the international auditors&#13;
agreed with ESM that all of the bad or doubtful debt would be wholly or partially written&#13;
off depending on the likelihood of collection. This produced a large one- time write-off of&#13;
new and old receivables amounting to 650 million Denars and a reduction in accounts&#13;
receivable from 3.4 Billion Denars to 2.75 Billion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
4.07   This problem of non-payment or payment in shares is consuming a significant&#13;
part of the funds generated by the company and could place in jeopardy its capacity to&#13;
contribute the funds required to complete the project. For example, about one third of the&#13;
funds generated by operations in 1996 were used to finance receivables. To avoid this&#13;
problem, agreement was reached with ESM to reduce the ratio of accounts receivable to&#13;
revenues each year so that it attains a target level of 18% of annual revenue from sales&#13;
within four years. Payment in illiquid and potentially worthless shares also has to be&#13;
sharply reduced. Agreement was therefore reached that payments to ESMfor electricity&#13;
in the form of shares should be limited to no more than 5% of ESM's revenues from sales.&#13;
4.08 To further insure the financial health of the company, agreement was reached that&#13;
the company would achieve certain standard financial ratios starting in 1998. These&#13;
ratios are: 1) generation of funds from internal sources should be at least 30% of&#13;
investments; 2) funds generated from operations (net revenues) should be at least 150%&#13;
of debt service; 3) the current ratio must be no less than 1.2.&#13;
4.09   Debt/Equity. ESM has a very strong balance sheet. Its accounts payable, short&#13;
term debt and long term debt are all quite modest. However, most of the company's long&#13;
term debt ( about $44 Million) is in foreign exchange with significant debt repayments in&#13;
the next few years. Nevertheless, using the audited 1996 financial statements prepared&#13;
according to international accounting standards, all liabilities together are only 9% of the&#13;
value of assets with 91% of the value of assets represented by equity.&#13;
4.10    Financial Statements ESM  maintains its books according to Macedonian&#13;
accounting standards and they are audited by Macedonian Accountants, which find them&#13;
satisfactory. As a condition of the EBRD Loan they have also begun to prepare financial&#13;
statements according to international standards using one of the big international&#13;
accounting firms. (see para 4.06 above). However, the accountants do not express an&#13;
opinion on their accuracy. The main concerns of the accountants are: 1) they did not&#13;
audit the 1995 Financial Statements (another international auditor did); 2) the fixed assets&#13;
of the company should be revalued instead of just being indexed (see para. 4.01); 3) they&#13;
were unsure about the value assigned to the shares that ESM had received in payments&#13;
for certain bills (see para. 4.06 ); and 4) there were some intracompany transactions that&#13;
needed clarification. These issues were discussed with ESM which agreed to deal with&#13;
items 1 and 4 in the next six months. Item 7 will require an appraisal of fixed assets. Item&#13;
3 cannot easily be resolved since there is only a limited market for the shares. However,&#13;
any increase in the share amount would be limited by covenants proposed by the Bank&#13;
(see para 4.07 ) and should not alone result in the accountants being unwilling to express&#13;
an opinion. Agreement was therefore reached that ESM will have its fixed assets revalued&#13;
and will work with the international accountants to the extent required so that they can&#13;
express an opinion on the 1998financial statements.&#13;
4.11   Financial Operations The financial and accounting operations of the company&#13;
were reviewed both with ESM and with its international auditors. The accounting and&#13;
financial systems used by ESM are in relatively good shape since a substantial amount&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
was spent for hardware, software and technical assistance under the previous EBRD Loan&#13;
to ESM. As a result, ESM believes it now has the most advanced management&#13;
information systems in the country. These systems cover 38 separate units almost all of&#13;
whom have their own hardware and standard software. Coordination between the units&#13;
and headquarters, however, could still be firther improved though it has been improving&#13;
over the last several years and is expected to continue to improve. ( Most of the units used&#13;
to be self- managed under the old Yugoslav self-management system, but have been&#13;
steadily integrated into a single company.)&#13;
4.12   The finance and accounting area is headed by an Assistant General Manager&#13;
Finance and Accounting who reports directly to the General Manager of ESM - the chief&#13;
executive officer of the company. The Assistant General Manager has three " service&#13;
units" reporting directly to her, each headed by a Department Director. These three&#13;
service units are: finance, accounting, and planning and analysis (budgeting and&#13;
forecasting). In addition each of the separate "operating" units has a director of finance&#13;
and accounting who reports directly to the head of his/her unit but has a dotted line&#13;
relationship to the Assistant General Manager Finance and Accounting at headquarters.&#13;
There is also an internal audit department which reports directly to the General Manager.&#13;
4.13   The company prepares two complete financial reports in a year, at six months and&#13;
at the end of the year. There are, however, also monthly financial reports with&#13;
information on sales, costs, prices, receivables etc. Budgets are prepared once a year and&#13;
updated if necessary. Performance is measured against budget on a monthly basis, though&#13;
the units are not profits centers.&#13;
4.14    Spendable funds are mainly controlled by headquarters since funds are&#13;
transferred daily to headquarters from the collection accounts at the distribution units. In&#13;
addition most of the purchasing is done at headquarters by the Commercial Department,&#13;
which is responsible for procurement. The "operating" units have checking accounts on&#13;
which they can only write small checks. Moreover, any expenditure over 5000 DEM&#13;
requires the approval of the General Manager.&#13;
B. FINANCIAL FORECASTS&#13;
4.15   Table 4.2 below provides a forecast of ESM's operating revenues, operating&#13;
costs and operating income for the period 1996-2001. The 1996 figures are the audited&#13;
actual figures. The forecast figures assume a stable macro-economic situation in the&#13;
former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with 3% inflation and a stable exchange rate (55&#13;
Denars/dollar) and these assumptions are similar to those used in preparing the most&#13;
recent economic forecast for the country. The average electricity price is 7.5 Pfennigs at&#13;
the assumed exchange rate, starting in mid 1999.&#13;

Operations&#13;
4.16   The above forecast, which is similar to ESM's internal forecast, shows that ESM&#13;
is expected to have substantial operating profits throughout the forecast time period at the&#13;
agreed average price level. Furthermore, cash flow from operations (defined as operating&#13;
profits plus depreciation but excluding changes in working capital etc.) will be excellent&#13;
because of the good operating profits and the excellent depreciation. The financial&#13;
situation of the company will, however, depend largely on the level of accounts&#13;
receivable and the level of capital investments. As was pointed out in para. 4.07, it is&#13;
expected that agreement will be reached to gradually reduce the level of accounts&#13;
receivable. If this occurs the company's financial situation will further improve&#13;
substantially. The main capital requirements of the company over the next five years are&#13;
those for the rehabilitation of the hydropower plants, rehabilitation of the distribution&#13;
system and on going investments in generation and transmission. The high level of&#13;
expected cash flow from operations, including the liquidation of receivables, should be&#13;
adequate so that the company can finance most of this needed capital investments and&#13;
cover its debt service. The company is, however, currently constructing the Kozjak dam&#13;
and hydropower plant at the request of the Government and the Government could want&#13;
it to undertake other multi-purpose hydropower projects or other large projects. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
could constrain its ability to finance the current project. Therefore, agreement was&#13;
reached that ESM will not undertake large, new investments prior to the commissioning&#13;
of the Kozjak Dam and Powerhouse unless it can provide evidence satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank that it would continue to meet the financial ratios specifed in para 4.08 after&#13;
undertaking such expenditures. Table 4.3 below provides a summary statement of cash&#13;
flows.&#13;

5. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
5.01  The project has a number of benefits, largely from decreasing the costs of&#13;
operation and increasing reliability and safety with relatively low risks. The discussion of&#13;
benefits below is broken down into the three components. However, the components are&#13;
interrelated in that, for example, the improved energy management system (EMS) will&#13;
allow ESM to make better use of the increased hydropower capacity and production and&#13;
vice versa. Thus system improvement may be greater than the sum of the parts.&#13;
5.02 In general this analysis is carried out using international market-based prices and&#13;
costs. Taxes are excluded. Shadow prices could have been used for labor costs (see para.&#13;
5.14) but were not since they are not available. A sensitivity analysis assuming a lower&#13;
real cost for labor was carried out (see para. 5.16). The analysis excludes the Swiss grant&#13;
of 5 mil SF which was subject to a separate analysis conducted for the Government of&#13;
Switzerland by EEF.&#13;
A. HYDROPOWER PLANT REHABILITATION&#13;
5.03 The hydropower plants according to EEF are facing "equipment dilapidation" due&#13;
to age as well as obsolescence. As a result their generation, capacity , reliability and&#13;
safety are decreasing. Rehabilitation of these hydro-power plants is the least cost means&#13;
of providing the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia with peaking capacity.&#13;
Furthermore, as these plants continue to deteriorate from age they will become rapidly&#13;
more unreliable depriving the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia of its required&#13;
peaking capacity and leading to expensive outages. The only near term alternative, new&#13;
gas fired peaking units, would be much more expensive and increase the country's&#13;
already high reliance on imported energy. In emergencies power can sometimes be&#13;
obtained from the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's neighbors. However, this&#13;
power cannot be relied on since many of the neighboring power systems have serious&#13;
problems and political relationships in the Balkans are uncertain.&#13;
5.04 The main benefits from rehabilitation of the hydropower plants are thus: 1)&#13;
increased hydropower generating capacity leading to improved primary and secondary&#13;
regulation; 2) increased hydropower generation; 3) reduction in hydropower plant&#13;
operating costs; and 4) reduced likelihood of hydropower plant and system outages.&#13;
5.05  Increased Capaciy. The reconstruction of the turbines at the hydropower plants&#13;
will add significantly to the generating capacity of these plants by increasing the&#13;
efficiency with which the water from the penstocks is used. This additional capacity will&#13;
add to system reserves and improve primary and secondary regulation. There are two&#13;
estimates of the increase in capacity. ESM has estimated that the total capacity increase&#13;
will be about 40 MW while the consultant, EEF, has estimated that the total increase in&#13;
capacity will be 31 MW. ESM and EEF use different assumptions but the assumptions&#13;
used by EEF are more conservative. In order to be conservative, for the purpose of this&#13;
analysis an increase of 31 MW has been used. If this capacity were to be built on a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
greenfield basis it would probably cost around $1580/Kw, based on the average cost per&#13;
Kw of 16 proposed new hydropower plants in the former Yugoslav Republic of&#13;
Macedonia. (See The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Energy Review, Report&#13;
15313-Mk, Appendix B.) This would imply a replacement value of this additional&#13;
capacity of about $49 million. However, in market economies this system reserve&#13;
capacity can often be contracted from other power systems. The Macedonians have not&#13;
contracted reserve capacity but from previous work done on the adjacent Bulgarian&#13;
Electricity System, (See Staff Appraisal Report Bulgaria Energy Project, Report 11250-&#13;
BUL, page 38), it is estimated that this reserve capacity can be contracted for about&#13;
$100,000/MW/year. If this price is used for the additional Macedonian capacity it gives&#13;
it a value of $3.1 Million per year.&#13;
5.06 Increased Generafion. The increase in hydropower generation due to increased&#13;
efficiency of the turbines is estimated by EEF 13.7 Gwh per year. This is a gain of 1.9%&#13;
on average for the six plants and assumes an average year with 730 Gwh of hydropower&#13;
generation from these plants. Again this is a conservative assumption, since this 1.9%&#13;
gain in efficiency would have led to a 24.4 Gwh increase in generation last year and 16.3&#13;
Gwh increase in generation using the average of the past three years. This additional&#13;
power would be largely peaking power and generated in the winter when the demand for&#13;
power in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is at its peak due to the heating&#13;
load. It would replace either power generated from thermal power plants in the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia or power swaps with neighbors. This additional power&#13;
has been valued at 5 US cents/Kwh which is both a measure of consumers willingness to&#13;
pay (See para. 2.17.) and in the range of estimates of Long Run Marginal Cost. (See The&#13;
Forrmer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia Energy Review, para. 5.21.) Thus the value of&#13;
this additional power, without any addition for consumer's surplus, would be $ 685,000&#13;
per year.&#13;
5.07  O    iig Cot. The investments in the hydropower plants will significantly&#13;
reduce operating costs, mainly repair costs, by replacing worn out or obsolete equipment.&#13;
Current equipment is expensive to maintain with the cost of repairs (mostly spare parts)&#13;
amounting to about $ 2 million per year. EEF has estimated that with the rehabilitation of&#13;
the plants the cost of repairs could be reduced to about $ 1 million per year for a net gain&#13;
of $ 1.0 million per year. It is assumed that this would continue for 10 years and then that&#13;
repair costs would again start to rise, reaching their current level in 20 years.&#13;
5.08  Outags. Because of the age of the equipment, outages of hydropower generating&#13;
units are expected to increase rapidly unless these units are rehabilitated. As a first&#13;
approximation, EEF assumed that one power plant out of six would be out of operation&#13;
one month per year if no rehabilitation were undertaken and that this risk would be&#13;
reduced by two thirds if the plants were rehabilitated. This implies that as a result of the&#13;
rehabilitation the lost generation from outages of hydropower plants would be reduced by&#13;
about 7 Gwh per year. If in fact this electricity was unserved energy (i.e. it resulted in&#13;
brown outs or black outs) the value would be very high. Typical values for unserved&#13;
energy, used in planning studies in the US are in the range of $1.00 to $4.00 per Kwh.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
($1000-$4000/Mwh) and in planning studies in Bulgaria values of 30 US cents/Kwh or&#13;
more are used. However, we have valued this electricity at 5 US cents/Kwh as explained&#13;
above which gives this benefit a value of $350,000 per year. This assumes that the&#13;
electricity would have been replaced by electricity generated from thermal power plants&#13;
or by swaps with neighboring countries.&#13;
5.09  Total benefits, Total estimated benefits thus are about $5.13 million per year,&#13;
using quite conservative assumptions. The Economic Rate of Return ( ERR) on this&#13;
component would then be about 17%. Including the 18% contingencies in the capital&#13;
costs reduces the ERR to 14%. If less conservative assumptions are used, for example&#13;
assuming the outages described in para 5.08 above would lead to unserved energy valued&#13;
at $500/Mwh ( see para 5.13), then the ERR would be over 30%. The base case of&#13;
estimate of 17%, however, appears to be a reasonable.&#13;
B. COMPLETION OF ENERGY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM&#13;
5.10 The Energy Management System ( EMS) will increase efficiency, reliability and&#13;
security of supply in the power system. There are no good alternatives, and without the&#13;
EMS the power system would have higher operating and maintenance costs and need a&#13;
higher reserve margin to minimize loss of load probability.&#13;
5.11 The quantifiable benefits of a modern Energy Management System (EMS) are&#13;
derived from four main areas: (i) generation scheduling benefits; (ii) benefits from&#13;
improved system reliability and security; (iii) operation and maintenance cost savings;&#13;
and (iv) benefits from sharing of common spinning reserves in a large interconnected&#13;
power system, such as that of Western European Power Interconnected System (UCPTE).&#13;
The extent of these benefits depends on the structure and size of the power system.&#13;
5.12  Generation Scheduling Benefits.  The benefits arise from on-line economic&#13;
dispatch, both of units under real-time control as well as those that are controlled&#13;
manually, and economic dispatch of spinning reserve. The main benefit is fuel savings.&#13;
Large utilities with significant variations in fuel costs have claimed savings of 1% to 4%&#13;
of total annual fuel cost. For ESM, the generation component of the electric system is&#13;
dominated by the three units (3x 225 MW) of the Bitola lignite-fired power plant. On&#13;
any given operating day, the Bitola units may account for more than 75% of the power&#13;
output. As a result, ESM does not stand to gain as much from the opportunity for&#13;
exploiting diversification of generating resources, as larger electric utilities can gain from&#13;
Economic Dispatch and Unit Commitment programs. However, the opportunity does&#13;
exist to receive some benefit from hydro-thermal scheduling (including Unit&#13;
Commitment), optimal power flow, loss minimalization, and on-line Economic Dispatch.&#13;
For the ESM system, estimated savings are expected to be about 1% of total annual fuel&#13;
cost or $ 365,000 per year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
5.13 Benefits from Improved Reliability of Operations. Utilities generally have&#13;
reported gains in overall system reliability resulting from the implementation of an EMS.&#13;
Benefits arise from a decrease in outages due to an increase in overall security of&#13;
electricity supply. This in turn results from improved control over power flow through the&#13;
transmission network, and faster response and restoration after a black-out. In addition to&#13;
the revenue gains from fewer outages there are social benefits reflecting the indirect cost&#13;
to the economy of power outages. The Bank's consultant on this component as well as&#13;
ESM have estimated that an improvement in reliability of 0.025%, or 2.2 hours per year,&#13;
can be achieved by installing an EMS. In putting a value on this reduction in potential&#13;
system outages, it is assumed that these potential system outages would occur during the&#13;
winter since this is when the system is under greatest pressure due to the heating load .In&#13;
the winter a potential outage of 2.2 hours would imply a potential loss in consumption of&#13;
about 2.2 million Kwh. As pointed out above, estimates in the US of the costs of&#13;
unserved energy are high but given the lower levels of income and GNP in the former&#13;
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a lower value for unserved energy should apply.&#13;
Therefore for the purposes of this analysis a value of 50 US cents/Kwh ($500/Mwh) was&#13;
used. ( It should be noted, however, that an analysis made for the earlier EMS Project for&#13;
the Yugoslav Federation indicated a much higher value- $2000/Mwh for unserved&#13;
energy. However, this was an estimate for all of Yugoslavia, not the former Yugoslav&#13;
Republic of Macedonia which was one of the poorer parts, and the estimate was made in&#13;
much better economic circumstances) This value of $500/Mwh for unserved energy&#13;
implies in turn that the reduction in potential system outages resulting from the EMS&#13;
would be worth about $ 1.1 Million per year.&#13;
5.14  Benefits from Qperation and Maintenanc *       . ESM can gain greatly&#13;
from the efficiencies that an Energy Management System offers, particularly in&#13;
substation operations. In the United Sates, many substations are "operator-less" and&#13;
"crew-less" and are served by mobile crews. ESM has calculated a personnel benefit&#13;
based on the reduction of substation staffing from 170 to 70 staff. Similar benefits could&#13;
be realized from reduction in power plant operating staff. This implies that ESM's staff&#13;
could be reduced by about 200 persons as a result of the EMS. Given that the typical&#13;
employee costs ESM $6700 per year this implies a potential savings of about $1.34&#13;
Million per year. (This estimate of $6700 per worker is the financial savings for ESM; the&#13;
economic benefit to the country from redeploying workers over time may be less though&#13;
how much less is not clear.) These savings are unlikely to be implemented immediately&#13;
and but still they could be implemented over a few year through a reduction in new hires.&#13;
5.15  Other Benefit. These are savings that would arise from the connection of the&#13;
Macedonian network to the UCPTE network and the sharing of common spinning&#13;
reserves which would reduce the requirement for ESM to have independent spinning&#13;
reserves. A good EMS would significantly improve the ability of ESM to reconnect to&#13;
UCPTE. Estimates of these benefits are currently not included in the project benefits, due&#13;
to the current uncertainty about the timing of the reconnection to the UCPTE system.&#13;
(See para. 2.13.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
5.16 Total Benefits. The total benefits from the Energy Management System (EMS)&#13;
are about $2.8 Million per year when the system is fully operating and the number of&#13;
personnel have been reduced. Total base case costs of completion are $ 8.7 Million.&#13;
Taking into account that the attrition in personnel will likely be slow, the ERR on this&#13;
component would be about 30% using base costs. Including contingencies in capital costs&#13;
decreases the rate of return to 25%. If it were assumed that the economic benefit from&#13;
reducing the work force at ESM and employing new workers elsewhere is only one half&#13;
the financial benefit (i.e. $3350 per person instead of $6700) and using capital cost&#13;
including contingencies, then the ERR would be reduced to 19 % - still a very good real&#13;
rate of return.&#13;
C. DISTRIBUTION CPONENT&#13;
5.17 This is the smallest component and would just begin the rehabilitation of the&#13;
distribution system. It is estimated that the new transformers might reduce losses by&#13;
about 0.5% of sales. This would amount to 25 Gwh per year. Assuming again that the&#13;
value of this electricity is 5 US cents/Kwh, this implies a value of the saved electricity of&#13;
about 1.25 million dollars per year. The real economic rate of return on this component&#13;
would be quite high at 26% using base costs and 22% including contingencies.&#13;
D. TOTAL PROJECT BENEFITS&#13;
5.18 The real ERR for the project as a whole is 21% making conservative assumptions&#13;
and taking as total capital costs, base capital costs. Including 18% contingencies in&#13;
capital costs reduces the ERR to 17%. In both case the ERR is quite good since this is a&#13;
rehabilitation/completion project with high benefits attributable to relatively moderate&#13;
investments.&#13;
E. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
5.19  The risks in the project are quite low, though there is a possibility of&#13;
implementation delays since the Macedonians have little experience with Bank&#13;
procurement procedures. The delays, however, would not necessarily have a major&#13;
impact on the ERR since both outlays and benefits would be delayed. Moreover, the&#13;
process of hiring consultants to assist with engineering/procurement began before the&#13;
project was appraised and consultants for both the hydropower rehabilitation and EMS&#13;
Components should be in place prior to Loan effectiveness. This should greatly speed up&#13;
procurement and offset the Macedonians lack of experience with Bank procedures.&#13;
5.20 There is a risk that ESM may not be able to generate sufficient local counterpart&#13;
funds for the project due to inadequacy of tariff levels or over-spending on other projects.&#13;
This tariff risk is mitigated by the requirement that the Government maintain adequate&#13;
tariff levels and by the Government's past practices in this regard. Furthermore, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
company's financial health should be maintained by the various financial covenants&#13;
which it is required to meet. Other risks by components are discussed below.&#13;
5.21  Hydropower Plant Rehabilitation. Procurement on this component is somewhat&#13;
more difficult since it is mainly replacement equipment and there are a limited number of&#13;
suppliers. However, there appear to be sufficient suppliers that ICB can be used.&#13;
Furthermore, as was pointed out above, consultants will be hired to insure that&#13;
procurement is done as fast as feasible following Bank Guidelines. Costs could be higher&#13;
than anticipated, but this seems unlikely given that EFF's overall cost estimates are&#13;
similar to those produced by ESM. A continuing period of very dry weather would have&#13;
a negative impact on project performance since there would be less water available to&#13;
generate power even if the power were generated more efficiently. However, the&#13;
calculations of the ERR were based on recent Macedonian experience which has been&#13;
one of relative dryness.&#13;
5.22 EMS Cgmponent. Due to the high technology nature of the project, there are&#13;
risks associated with the fact this technology is continuously evolving and changing&#13;
rapidly. There is, therefore a risk that the staff involved in project implementation may&#13;
lack certain necessary skills at key dates. The participation of qualified consultants and&#13;
carefully scheduled training tied to the key supply contracts should minimize the risk.&#13;
5.23  Distribution. The risks in the distribution component are quite small and it&#13;
appears to be attractive as a small separate component. However, the full impact of this&#13;
component would occur only if ESM rehabilitates the entire distribution system. ESM&#13;
will need outside funding for such a major distribution project and has discussed with the&#13;
Bank the possibility of funding such a future project.&#13;
F. PROIECT SUSIAIABILITY&#13;
5.24   The project is entirely sustainable as long as the equipment is properly&#13;
maintained and the needed repairs and updating are carried out. This is in turn likely to&#13;
depend largely on the level of electricity prices. If prices are maintained at an adequate&#13;
level ESM has both the funds and the incentive to repair and update the equipment.&#13;
However, if electricity prices were to decline to the point that they only covered cash&#13;
costs or below then ESM would cut back on maintenance and the equipment would&#13;
deteriorate. It is in the interest of the Government and ESM to maintain an adequate level&#13;
of electricity prices and this is reinforced by the Bank's covenants. With adequate upkeep&#13;
the hydroelectric plants can then produce electricity almost indefinitely since their fuel&#13;
(water) is renewable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 3-2&#13;
Page 1 of 4&#13;
Dam Safr&#13;
Recommendations&#13;
This Annex summarizes the recommendations made by the dam safety consultants which&#13;
could further enhance safety. (This is in addition to the safety investments required to&#13;
reduce the phreatic line in the downstream shell at Mavrovo). All the cost figures cover&#13;
only the foreign currency component. Local currency costs would add the equivalent of&#13;
about $60,000 to the total.&#13;
1.0   Review of Macedonian Dam Safety Regulations. This recommendation is based&#13;
on the English translation of 17 Macedonian articles related to dam safety and&#13;
discussions with dam owners. It would appear from this information that Dam&#13;
Safety Regulations should be reviewed to see if they may need to be strengthened.&#13;
It is therefore recommended to prepare a good English translation of all dam-&#13;
safety related documents, and to have these reviewed by an international expert&#13;
who would discuss requirements with the dam owners ( mostly, but not entirely&#13;
ESM).&#13;
Foreign currency component: costs for a review of revised regulations by an&#13;
international expert or a review panel, e.g ...........................   $ 20,000&#13;
2.0   Software for automated data plotting of monitoring results. Data of hundreds&#13;
of instrument records are plotted in a cumbersome way by hand. This archaic way&#13;
is not only time consuming but also slow with respect to obtaining information&#13;
about unusual or changed conditions. The monitoring team is aware of the&#13;
problem and is gradually improving the situation. It is, however, recommended to&#13;
shortcut this process and acquire one of the numerous excellent software packages&#13;
which were developed for other dams.&#13;
Foreign currency component: costs for acquiring a dam-specific data processing&#13;
and plotting program including tramining ...........................$ 10,000&#13;
3.0   Training. Local budgets do not provide expenditures for professional training&#13;
such as overseas study tours, participation on international dam safety conferences&#13;
or the like. Moreover, there does not exist any means to acquire technical&#13;
literature. It is recommended that funding be provided for periodic study tours to&#13;
visit dams, meet leading personnel of dam safety institutions and attend&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3-2&#13;
Page 2 of 4&#13;
conferences on dam safety. It is also recommended to establish something like a&#13;
"dam safety library" stacked with technical literature (books, proceedings from&#13;
conferences, subscription of "Hydropower &amp; Dams" etc.)&#13;
Foreign currency component:&#13;
(a) Overseas study tour: 4 participants, duration: 2 weeks, including: air travel,&#13;
local travel and   accommodation, accompanied by local staff in the foreign&#13;
country, participation at a   conference, costs per&#13;
tour ................             $ 50,000&#13;
(b) Dam safety library   .... $ 12,000&#13;
4.0   Inspection of morning glory spillway tunnels. The transition section from shaft&#13;
to tunnel in the morning glory spillways is prone to cavitation damage. This is&#13;
particularly so if the concrete quality is poor, as in the case of Tikves dam. It is&#13;
recommended to inspect the spillway tunnels after each spilling in excess of 10%&#13;
of the spillway capacity.&#13;
5.0   Replacement of failed pressure cells by conventional standpipes. In the 4 dams&#13;
184 out of 265 electrical pressure cells (pore and total pressure) are out of order or&#13;
render unreliable results. Some of these instruments are dispensable, others are&#13;
not. It is recommended to replace those pore pressure cells in the core of Spilje&#13;
and Tikves dams, which are necessary to evaluate reliable pressure gradients by&#13;
new electrical cells or standpipes. In the case of Mavrovo dam, a review of the&#13;
downstream pore pressure pattern should support the decision which failed&#13;
piezometers, if any, should be replaced. The cost estimate below assumes the&#13;
replacement of 50 electrical piezometer cells. Drilling and other civil works is&#13;
assumed to be covered by local contractors and is therefore not considered in the&#13;
foreign currency component.&#13;
Foreign currency component: 75 electrical piezometers to be installed by&#13;
technician of the supplier ....                      $ 70,000&#13;
6.0   Upgrading of part of the existing instruments. It is recommended to create a&#13;
reserve fund for replacement and upgrading of instruments which are already, or&#13;
will become obsolete in the near future. This mainly refers to contact gauges to&#13;
measure piezometric levels and to leakage measurement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 3-2&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
Foreign currency component:&#13;
(a) 4 contact gauges with accessories ................................ $ 8,000&#13;
(b) Contingency for yet unallocated replacements ............................. $ 10,000&#13;
7.0   Automated control for leakage at Spilje and Tikves dams. Leakage at these&#13;
two dams is high and at Spilje dam it has an increasing tendency. Moreover,&#13;
sudden changes in seepage flow are possible due to the karstic geology at Spilje&#13;
dam and due to a partly permeable grout curtain at Tikves dam. It is therefore&#13;
recommended to install an automated control to record leakage for these two&#13;
dams.&#13;
Foreign currency component:&#13;
Two level meters (submergible probe) and remote control recording systems&#13;
(chart recorder) to be installed in the control room of the power houses at Spilje&#13;
and Tikves dams .........                                 $ 62,500&#13;
8.0   "No overtopping" analysis for Spilje dam. The arrangement for gate operation&#13;
of the bottom outlets is unique. Can the spillway design flood be discharged by&#13;
the spillway alone (bottom outlet inoperable) without causing overtopping? An&#13;
analysis should investigate this exceptional scenario.&#13;
............................................................................ $20,000&#13;
9.0    Review of SDF for Tikves dam. The spillway design flood for Tikves dam is&#13;
based on a hydrological recording period 1935-1963/65. It is recommended to&#13;
review the SDF based on updated hydrological&#13;
records ......                  $20,000&#13;
10    FiniteElement-analysis for earthquake loading. A FE-analysis for those dams&#13;
is recommended which were analyzed only pseudo-&#13;
dynamically ......     $20,000&#13;
Total foreign currency component:   .      ...................... $ 290,000&#13;
Local component         ....................... $60,000&#13;
Grand Total             ..                   ..................... $350,000&#13;

PROMCT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
1.    The project will be implemented by ESM with technical assistance from outside&#13;
consultants. Two groups of outside consultants will be used, one for technical assistance&#13;
with the rehabilitation of the hydropower plants and the second for technical assistance&#13;
with the completion of the Energy Management System ( EMS). No technical assistance&#13;
is required for the small distribution component. Both groups of consultants will assist&#13;
ESM with preparing specifications, helping produce the procurement packages and&#13;
assisting with designing an implementation schedule. The implementation schedule is&#13;
somewhat complex since it has to take into account the likely timing of the availability of&#13;
replacement parts and new equipment, the time required to install them and the need for&#13;
having the various units available in order to meet the daily and seasonal changes in&#13;
electricity demand. Bidding packages including terms of reference and short lists have&#13;
been prepared for both groups of consultants. The hydropower rehabilitation consultants&#13;
will be hired before the project goes to the Board and there is a significant probability that&#13;
the EMS consultants will be hired by that time also though it is not a requirement of the&#13;

3.    In Annex 3-1 are tables which show the projected timetable for various packages.&#13;
However, these dates must be considered quite tentative since, as is indicated in the first&#13;
paragraph, one of the major tasks of the consultants will be to prepare implementation&#13;
schedules taking a number of technical factors into account (need for plants, time&#13;
required for rehabilitation, water flows, availability of skilled workers, manufacturing&#13;
time for equipment etc.). These implementation schedules once prepared should be more&#13;
accurate and the current schedules are considered quite tentative.&#13;

            Macedonia - Power System Improvement Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Power System Improvement Project for
            Macedonia aims to achieve the following: 1) increase the
            efficiency of hydropower generation; 2) expand the
            generating capacity of the major hydropower plants through
            rehabilitation; 3) increase system operating efficiency and
            enable the electric company to optimize operation of its
            power generation and transmission facilities through
            reducing costs; 4) begin reducing high losses in the
            electricity distribution system; 5) facilitate the
            development of independent power producers, with the initial
            plants being mini-hydropower plants; and 6) help reintegrate
            Macedonia's power company (ESM) into UCPTE (the Western
            European Electricity network) by improving its system
            controls. The project consists of three components: 1)
            rehabilitating the six largest hydropower plants in
            Macedonia, which represent 91 percent of the country's
            hydropower capacity; 2) improving the energy management
            system including modernizing data acquisition and installing
            remote controls for the power system, completing the
            dispatch center, and improving telecommunications; and 3)
            beginning the rehabilitation of the electricity distribution system.
