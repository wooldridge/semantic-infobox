            Exchange rate risk
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Among the key risks facing foreign
            private entities investing in the infrastructure of
            developing countries is depreciation or devaluation of the
            local currency. Indeed, over the past 25 years developing
            country currencies lost 72 percent of their value relative
            to the U.S. dollar on average-and about a fifth lost more
            than 99 percent of their value. Sustainable private
            investment in infrastructure depends on addressing this risk
            well. Private infrastructure contracts in developing
            countries have usually passed much of this risk on to
            customers or the government. But because devaluations and
            large depreciations in developing countries often occur in
            the context of macroeconomic and financial upheaval, such
            risk allocations cannot always be made to work. The
            difficulty arises because the contracts raise prices
            precisely when the economy is suffering the most. If the
            government bears the risk because a state-owned utility is
            purchasing power from an independent power producer at
            prices denominated in U.S. dollars, for example, a contract
            will require steep increases in local currency prices just
            when the utility ' s revenues-and those of its owner,
            the government-are likely to be declining.
