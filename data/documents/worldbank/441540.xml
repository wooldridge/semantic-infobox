* The liberalization of gas supply provided&#13;
certain immediate benefits to industrial con-&#13;

Even the first step toward a spot market-setting&#13;

            Gas reform in Ukraine : monopolies,
            markets, and corruption
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Reform of the natural gas industry in
            Ukraine started a year later than reform of the power
            industry. Because gas reform had no blueprint, its direction
            has remained ambiguous. That ambiguity is the result of a
            conflict between those who advocate vertically integrated,
            opaque, monopolistic structures and those who want a
            transparent, competitive gas market governed by stable
            rules. This conflict will likely continue for several years,
            making the ultimate outcome difficult to predict. More by
            accident than by design, the reform produced a number of
            innovative features that might be of interest for other
            countries planning to restructure and privatize their gas industries.
