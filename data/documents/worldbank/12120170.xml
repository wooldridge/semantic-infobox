            The privatization experience of Latin
            America : sell-off helps fiscal stability
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Between 1985 and 1992, governments in
            the Latin American and Caribbean region privatized more than
            2,000 publicly owned enterprises including banks, ports,
            airlines, highways, retail shops, public utilities, and
            insurance companies. Chile and Mexico were among the first
            and most comprehensive. Their example was followed by
            Argentina, and soon most of the region had begun
            privatization programs. In nearly all countries, the primary
            motivation for this sell-off was the fiscal and debt crisis.
            With the revenues from the sale of state enterprises,
            governments were able to significantly reduce the
            hemorrhaging of public resources. In fact, what
            distinguishes this privatization effort from those in most
            other regions is its success in generating large revenues
            from public enterprise sales. More recently, however,
            divestiture policy has been based on objectives of
            efficiency, productivity, and new investment. Therefore,
            privatization was expected to result in lower prices,
            improved service delivery, and better product quality.
            Policymakers have also seen the rapid sale of state-owned
            enterprises (SOE) to a large and diverse group of new owners
            as a way of ensuring an irreversible reduction of the public sector.
