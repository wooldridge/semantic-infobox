   In this case, a scale is considered reliable if two conditions are satisfied: a factor with at least three items is generated through factor analysis with an eigenvalue&#13;
   greater than one (which measures the amount of variance each factor accounts for) and a strong internal consistency, captured by an alpha coefficient greater or&#13;
   equal to 0.70. (For more information, see A.N. Oppenheim, Questionnaire Design, Interviewing, and Attitude Measurement, Pinter and Kline, 1992; and P. Kline, An&#13;
   Easy Guide to Factor Analysis, Routledge, 1994.) The Cronbachâ&#128;&#153;s alpha calculated for the beliefs scale in Peru was 0.78.&#13;

  It is important to clarify that this category refers to households that have handwashing stations that would be considered adequate for both sanitation facilities, whether this is one&#13;
handwashing station or two. This is different from the preceding category, which accounts for households that have a designated station for at least one of the two facilities. This second&#13;
category makes the pool of potential handwashers larger.&#13;

In Peru, knowledge was simply defined by knowledge of                                Soap Attributes, Locus of Control, and Intention&#13;

            Behavioral determinants of handwashing with
            soap among mothers and caretakers : emergent learning from
            Senegal and Peru
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP)
            has supported the Global Scaling up Handwashing Project in
            Peru, Senegal, Tanzania, and Vietnam. The project has tested
            whether innovative promotional approaches to behavior change
            can generate widespread and sustained improvements in
            household hygiene practices. The implementation phase of the
            project ended in June 2011. The project has a significant
            learning objective, an important component of which is to
            ascertain the key factors that influence behavior change.
            These are known as behavioral determinants. Studies such as
            a formative research study conducted in Kenya in 2007 have
            found that while knowledge around hand-washing tends to be
            high, practice rates are low. This finding is illustrative
            of the knowledge-behavior gap encountered by anti-smoking
            and condom-use initiatives, among others, and reflects the
            complexity of human behavior. More specifically, FOAM
            (Focus, Opportunity, Ability, and Motivation) was developed
            to inform the design of formative research, interventions as
            well as monitoring to increase the effectiveness of its
            behavior change program. A key feature of the project is its
            monitoring and evaluation component, which includes
            randomized control baseline and end-line studies,
            longitudinal surveys, periodic implementation surveys, and a
            comprehensive management information system (MIS) that
            enabled continuous monitoring and improvement. These
            components have been used to measure and track key
            indicators such as diarrhea incidence. This Learning Note
            aims to highlight key findings from two studies, the impact
            evaluation baseline study conducted in Peru in 20074 and a
            'doer/non-doer' study conducted in Senegal in 2010.
