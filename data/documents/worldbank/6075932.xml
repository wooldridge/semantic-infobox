ABSTRACT&#13;
The purpose of this paper is to examine the role of the private&#13;
sector and the potential for recovering costs in the public sector in the&#13;
provision of education and health services in Indonesia. These policy options&#13;
are explored with particular attention to their budgetary and equity&#13;
implications.&#13;
The study concludes that the option of encouraging a greater role for&#13;
the private sector is feasible and desirable in both the education and health&#13;
sectors. To examine the equity question in education, the shares of school-&#13;
age children at different levels of schooling for households in different&#13;
economic classes and areas of residence are obtained from the data tapes of&#13;
the National Socioeconomic Survey (SUSENAS) of 1978. Government subsidies per&#13;
student are estimated for the different educational levels; these are applied&#13;
to the estimated numbers of public students to obtain the shares of government&#13;
subsidies going to different household groups. The conclusion is that the&#13;
present distribution of government subsidies in education is skewed toward the&#13;
rich, especially in urban areas, because the rich are more likely to use the&#13;
higher levels of service where the subsidies per student are greater. A&#13;
similar exercise ls done for health. An overall increase in user fees, which&#13;
incorporates a more progressive fee structure, would have the effect of&#13;
reducing the fiscal burden on the government while making for greater equity&#13;
in the distribution of benefits.&#13;

L'objet de cette etude est de voir quel role le secteur prive&#13;
pourrait jouer dans la fourniture des services d'education et de sant6 en&#13;
Indonesie et comment le secteur public pourrait recouvrer ses coats. On y&#13;
examine ces options en s'arretant en particulier sur leurs implications&#13;
pour le budget et sur le plan de l'equite.&#13;
La conclusion de cette etude est qu'il serait faisable et sou-&#13;
haitable d'encourager le secteur prive a jouer un plus grand role tant&#13;
dans le secteur de l'education que dans celui de la sante. En ce qui con-&#13;
cerne l'6quit6 en education, on a tire de la banque de donnees de l'Enquete&#13;
socio-6conomique nationale (SUSENAS) de 1978 les pourcentages d'enfants&#13;
d'Age scolaire inscrits dans les differents niveaux d'enseignement pour&#13;
des m6nages appartenant a diverses classes economiques et habitant dans&#13;
des zones differentes. On calcule les subventions de l'Etat par 6leve aux&#13;
differents niveaux de l'enseignement et on applique ces montants aux&#13;
effectifs estimatifs d'eleves dans l'enseignement public pour determiner&#13;
les pourcentages respectifs des subventions de l'Etat allant aux diffe-&#13;
rents groupes de menages. I1 en resulte que la repartition actuelle des&#13;
subventions de l'Etat dans le secteur de l'education favorise les riches,&#13;
dans les villes surtout, car ils sont plus nombreux aux niveaux superieurs&#13;
de l'enseignement ou les subventions par eleve sont plus elevees.    Le&#13;
secteur de la sante fait l'objet d'une etude similaire. Une augmentation&#13;
globale des frais de participation demandes aux utilisateurs, comportant&#13;
une structure plus progressive des tarifs, reduirait la charge financiere&#13;
de l'Etat tout en rendant plus equitable la repartition des avantages.&#13;

Este estudio tiene por objeto examinar el papel del sector privado y&#13;
el potencial de la recuperaci6n de costos del sector publico en lo que respecta&#13;
a la educaci6n y los servicios de salud que se ofrecen en Indonesia. Se anali-&#13;

En este estudio se concluye que la opci6n de inducir al sector privado&#13;
a que desempenie un papel mAs importante es factible y conveniente tanto en el&#13;
sector de la educaci6n como en el de la salud. Al examinar la cuesti6n de la&#13;
equidad en la educaci6n se tom6 de las cintas magneticas de datos del National&#13;
Socioeconomic Survey (Estudio socioecon6mico nacional) de 1978 informaci6n sobre&#13;
la proporci6n de ninios en edad escolar de distintos niveles de educaci6n en&#13;
diversas clases econ6micas y zonas residenciales. Se calculan los subsidios del&#13;
Gobierno para diferentes niveles educacionales; estos se aplican al numero esti-&#13;
mado de estudiantes de las escuelas publicas para obtener la proporci6n de sub-&#13;
sidios del Gobierno correspondiente a distintos grupos de familias. La conclu-&#13;
si6n es que la distribuci6n actual de los subsidios del Gobierno a la educaci6n&#13;
tiene un sesgo a favor de los ricos, especialmente en las zonas urbanas, porque&#13;
los ricos tienen mayores probabilidades de usar los servicios de nivel mas alto&#13;
en lugares en que los subsidios por estudiante son mas elevados. Se hace un&#13;
estudio semejante para la salud. Un aumento global de los cargos a usuarios, en&#13;
el cual se incorporara una estructura de cargos mAs progresiva, reduciria la&#13;
carga fiscal del Gobierno y produciria una distribuci6n mas equitativa de los&#13;
beneficios.&#13;

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION&#13;
This paper was prepared at the request of the World Bank's&#13;
East Asia and Pacific Country Programs Department to be an input into&#13;
the 1983 Country Economic Memorandum for Indonesia.     (An abridged ver-&#13;
sion of the paper appears as Annex II of the Country Economic Memoran-&#13;
dum.) The purpose is to examine the role of the private sector and the&#13;
potential for recovering costs in the public sector in the provislon of&#13;
education and health services in Indonesia.     These policy options are&#13;
explored with particular attention to their budgetary and equity impll-&#13;
cations.&#13;
The paper examines the past record of the Indonesian govern-&#13;
ment and finds that the expansion in education and health facilitles&#13;
over the last decade has been quite remarkable.      Moreover, an attempt&#13;
has been made to equalize access of services across different geograph-&#13;
ical regions and to increase the utilization of services.      However, a&#13;
great deal remains to be done to expand the provision of services fur-&#13;
ther and to reduce inequality of access.     A number of obstacles remain&#13;
in the achievement of universal primary education:      the inability or&#13;
unwillingness on the part of poor parents to send their children to&#13;
school; problems of access; and high repetition and drop-out rates.&#13;
Considerable skewness remains in the availability and use of educational&#13;
and health facilities across different socioeconomic groups: there Is a&#13;
definite urban bias in the provision of services, especially at the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
higher levels, and the poor are more likely to avail themselves of the&#13;
lower levels of services.&#13;
The deteriorating financial situation which now confronts&#13;
Indonesia makes it more and more difficult to increase even the existing&#13;
budget shares going to education and health which, by international and&#13;
regional standards, are still low.    The situation has been exacerbated&#13;
by a decline in the proportion of costs recovered through user fees.&#13;
Thus the internal allocation of the budget among competing objectives&#13;
poses major problems for those in government:     to expand higher-level&#13;
facilities; to maintain the existing facilities and finance their opera-&#13;
tion; and to improve the quality of its facilities at all levels.      In&#13;
particular, recurrent expenditures, which hold the key to quality im-&#13;
provement and maintenance, are likely to come under severe pressure over&#13;
the next few years.&#13;
The study examines the financing of the education and health&#13;
sectors, distinguishing between private and public sector activities, as&#13;
well as the direct and indirect costs to the users.&#13;
In the education sector, the private sector is a significant&#13;
provider of services.    Private secondary schools and universities now&#13;
account for nearly half of all the students; private primary schools are&#13;
relatively less significant, and account for roughly 15 percent of total&#13;
enrollment. Private students in general finance their education entire-&#13;
ly through school or university fees, while public students receive&#13;
government subsidies which are at least equal to the per student recur-&#13;
rent expenditure less fees. Aside from school fees, there are a number&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of other fees paid directly to the schools, as well as indirect costs&#13;
which are incurred by all students whether they attend private or public&#13;
schools:   the cost of books and other supplies, the cost of uniforms,&#13;
transportation to and from school, pocket money, and boarding fees for&#13;
those students who have to live away from home in order to attend&#13;
school.&#13;
In the health sector, private services are provided by private&#13;
doctors, both modern and traditional, private hospitals and clinics,&#13;
private maternity centers and a small number of private health cen-&#13;
ters.   The government provides services through the government hospi-&#13;
tals, public health centers and subcenters, and community health volun-&#13;
teers.   Private patients pay in full for hospital services, whereas&#13;
public services   are subsidized.     For public services,   considerable&#13;
additional private costs are still incurred:     drugs prescribed by the&#13;
doctor, transportation and so on.    There are three levels of financing&#13;
operating costs for government health services:      national, provincial&#13;
and local.&#13;
To examine the equity question in education, the shares of&#13;
school-age children at different levels of schooling for households in&#13;
different economic classes (poorest 40X, middle 30%, and richest 30%)&#13;
and areas of residence (urban or rural; Java or the Outer Islands) are&#13;
obtained  from the data tapes     of the National    Socioeconomic Survey&#13;
(SUSENAS) of 1978.   Variations in enrollment rates and in the propor-&#13;
tions of students in public schools across household groups mean that&#13;
the distribution of government subsidies in education across household&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
groups will be different from the distribution of school-age children.&#13;
Government per student subsidies are estimated for the different educa-&#13;
tional levels; these are applied to the estimated numbers of public&#13;
students to obtain the shares of government subsidies going to different&#13;
household groups.    Although primary-school subsidies are more or less&#13;
equitably distributed, in the sense that their shares in the different&#13;
household groups correspond closely to the shares of primary school-age&#13;
children, at higher levels of schooling the shares of subsidies become&#13;
more and more biased towards the better-off       households.   Under the&#13;
assumptions being made, children in the upper income classes account for&#13;
28 percent and 33 percent of the junior and senior secondary school-age&#13;
groups but would receive 33 percent and 55 percent of the subsidies at&#13;
these levels. Similarly, urban children account for 20 percent and 23&#13;
percent of the junior and senior secondary school-age groups while&#13;
receiving 29 percent and 50 percent of the subsidies.      University sub-&#13;
sidies are heavily biased towards rich urban households.        The upper&#13;
classes in urban areas receive 71 percent of university subsidies; they&#13;
account for only 14 percent of the relevant age group.&#13;
In a similar exercise for health, the shares of people in&#13;
different household groups who were sick at any time during a period of&#13;
one week are compared with the shares of those who visited a public&#13;
health center, a hospital or a doctor in private practice.      The middle&#13;
income classes in rural areas are the main users of public health cen-&#13;
ters; hospital visits are made by the upper income classes in both urban&#13;
and rural areas, as are visits to private doctors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Thus the study finds that the present distribution of govern-&#13;
ment subsidies in education and health Is skewed towards the rich,&#13;
especially in urban areas, since the rich are more likely to use the&#13;
higher levels of service where the subsidies are greater.    It concludes&#13;
that the option of encouraging a greater role of the private sector is&#13;
feasible and desirable in both the education and health sectors. With&#13;
respect to the public provision of services, an overall increase in user&#13;
fees which incorporates a more progressive fee structure would have the&#13;
effect of reducing the fiscal burden while making for greater equity in&#13;
the distribution of benefits.&#13;

I.  Introduction&#13;
The Government of Indonesia has, in recent years, directed greater&#13;
attention towards the social sectors by allocating a greater proportion of its&#13;
expenditures to them, as well as by enunciating more clearly its goals in&#13;
these sectors in the Outline of the Direction of the State (GHBN).&#13;
Although further progress towards these goals can be achieved by&#13;
addressing the problems of inadequate facilities, unequal geographical&#13;
distribution, and poor quality (as discussed later), two policy questions of&#13;
pivotal importance now face the government. The questions, notwithstanding&#13;
their philosophical aspects, are necessitated by economic considerations, and&#13;
concern the finding of additional and substitute resources, and the functional&#13;
balance in the allocation of those resources.&#13;
With regard to the first of these questions, there are two major&#13;
issues. First, is there a role for the private sector? If so, that role must&#13;
be defined and the means of bringing about the desired character and level of&#13;
private sector participation determined. Second, whether and haw much the&#13;
government should recover the costs of providing services through the&#13;
imposition of user fees in public facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

productivity, and the costs of the education that contributed to those higher&#13;
earnings, including foregone earnings of students who could otherwise be&#13;
contributing to the economy as well as the direct education costs, show&#13;
substantial rates of return when compared with primary education. The figures&#13;
are 22% for junior secondary graduates and 27% for senior secondary graduates&#13;
when compared to primary school graduates. These high rates of return hold up&#13;
even when there is a waiting period before a graduate gets a job. For&#13;
example, if the wait is as long as three years, the rate of return is still&#13;
14%. Thus the government as well as parents are justified in assuming that&#13;
secondary education is desirable. 1/ Estimates in another study based on the&#13;
1978 SAKERNAS data for urban males indicate social rates of return well above&#13;
any alternative discount rate for all levels of education, with the possible&#13;
exception of junior secondary education as a terminal qualification. 2/&#13;
Judged against the goals of the government, the development of the&#13;
education sector in Indonesia over the last decade has been quite&#13;
remarkable. The Second Five-Year Plan (Repelita II) included very specific&#13;
quantitative targets involving a primary school enrollment rate of 85% for the&#13;
7-12 age group by 1979, a continuation rate of 85% from primary schools to&#13;
junior secondary schools, and of 81% from junior to senior secondary&#13;

schools. 1/ The magnitude of the overall expansion in facilities has been&#13;
truly impressive. The numbers of primary and junior secondary schools&#13;
increased by 62% between 1968 and 1979, while the number of senior secondary&#13;
schools increased by 96%. Total school enrollment at all levels rose by 7.5%&#13;
per year between 1970/71 and 1980/81, with the rates of increase being greater&#13;
at the higher levels of schooling.   Whereas only 23% of first-grade pupils in&#13;
1964/65 had graduated in 1970, close to 50% of first graders in 1969/70&#13;
graduated in 1975/76. The literacy rate improved from 47% in 1960 to 61% in&#13;
1971 and 72% in 1980.&#13;
As far as public schools were concerned, much of the expansion has&#13;
taken place over a relatively short period covering Repelita II and III and&#13;
has been financed largely out of oil-export revenues: for primary school&#13;
construction through a special Presidential Instruction (INPRES-SD) item in&#13;
the development budget and for secondary school construction from the general&#13;
Department of Education and Culture development budget. From 1974 to 1976,&#13;
16,000 new primary schools were built, and in 1977 and 1978 15,000 more were&#13;
added under this program. During this period, nearly 200,000 primary school&#13;
teachers were hired.&#13;
There was a conscious attempt to equalize access of services across&#13;
different geographical regions by applying simple but effective criteria. For&#13;
example, the allocation of INPRES-SD for the construction of primary schools&#13;
has been biased in favor of the areas with fewer facilities. In Phase I of&#13;
the construction program (1973-1974) allocations were made to the provinces&#13;
based on the total number of primary school-age children (7-12) who were not&#13;

Building in East Java",   Bulletin of Indonesian Economic Studies, Vol. XIV,&#13;
No. 1, March 1978, p. 63.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
enrolled in school. The district/municipality (kabupaten/kotamadya) share of&#13;
the provincial allocation also depended on the percentage of the 7-12 age&#13;
group who were not enrolled in school. INPRES-SD also specified that each&#13;
district (kabupaten) should receive enough units to allow for at least one&#13;
building in each subdistrict (kecamatan). The criterion used in Phase II&#13;
(1975/76) was similar but was based on the projection of new pupils expected&#13;
to be accommodated in the district/municipality up to 1978. Similarly, the&#13;
current expansion of 1,000 junior secondary schools in 1982/83 will be&#13;
allocated first to subdistricts where there are no junior secondary schools at&#13;
all and then to subdistricts where there are no government junior secondary&#13;
schools.&#13;
The government also made an attempt to increase the utilization of&#13;
services. It abolished tuition fees for the first three grades in primary&#13;
schools in 1977 and for the last three grades in 1978. Writers in the early&#13;
1970's had the impression that fee levels before the abolition were already&#13;
high for many students and that raising them would limit enrollment to the&#13;
relatively well-to-do. 1/ It has also been observed that school enrollment&#13;
rates have increased dramatically, especially since school fees were&#13;
abolished. However, this statement is difficult to evaluate without taking&#13;
into account the simultaneous rapid increase in school places and the transfer&#13;
of some students from religious schools. 2/&#13;
Much of the expansion in education was carried out by the private&#13;
sector, especially at the higher levels. Private schools have sprung up to&#13;

fill the gap and absorb students. 1/ The variability in quality is greater in&#13;
private schools than in public schools: some are very selective while others&#13;
accept students who fail to earn places in government schools. While the&#13;
government has been primarily responsible for the expansion in primary&#13;
schools, the private sector has accounted for the greater part of the&#13;
expansion in secondary schools up to the end of the last decade.&#13;
In spite of the remarkable progress documented above, much still&#13;
remains to be done. The reason is that Indonesia started from a very low&#13;
base. Although education is considered to be a constitutional right and the&#13;
government is indeed providing enough school places to allow for universal&#13;
entry into primary education, some obstacles remain in the achievement of&#13;
universal primary education. First, there is inability or unwillingness on&#13;
the part of poor parents to send their children to school. Even though there&#13;
is no tuition fee at the primary level, indigent parents may not be able to&#13;
afford the entrance fees, uniforms, boarding fees, books and supplies or the&#13;
contributions that are required of them by the school-parents' BP3&#13;
(Educational Aid Association) and by the schools themselves from time to&#13;
time. In a study in 1977 it was found that the cost of uniforms and&#13;
transportation was roughly double what had to be paid to the school&#13;
directly. 2/ There is also evidence from the National Socioeconomic Survey&#13;
(SUSENAS 1978) that parents who are poor or who have had no schooling are less&#13;
likely than those with some schooling to send their children to school (see&#13;

Appendix Table 1). Moreover, each of these factors has an effect when other&#13;
factors are taken into account, including variations in access to and quality&#13;
of schooling (see Appendix Tables 2 and 3). Continuation in school is&#13;
likewise dependent on the ability of the marginal cases to keep up with the&#13;
various fees and expenses. 1/&#13;
Second, in some parts of the country the lack of demand is due simply&#13;
to problems of access. Even after the INPRES-SD program, there are some areas&#13;
which do not have schools nearby. The lack of suitable sites for schools or&#13;
the lack of funds for the purchase of such sites has meant that some INPRES-SD&#13;
schools are situated near previously existing schools rather than in a poorly-&#13;
served area. In 1976/77, 74% of all villages in rural areas had primary&#13;
schools, but the range across provinces was still large, from 26% to 100% (see&#13;
Appendix Table 4).&#13;
Third, the repetition and drop-out rates in primary schools are very&#13;
high. In 1978, one student out of six in the first grade was a repeater and&#13;
one out of eight in the second grade. 2/ In 1972/73, 10.4% of primary school&#13;
children dropped out of school and by 1975/76, the figure remained high at&#13;
6.5%. 3/ Drop-out rates are higher in the higher grades, III to V, (around&#13;
10%), while they are low in grades I and II (1% and 6%) 4/, suggesting perhaps&#13;

that children are pulled out of school to help support the family.    Analysis&#13;
of household-level data has shown that nearly half of the children aged 10-12&#13;
who are not attending school are working (see Appendix Table 5.) And a study&#13;
in East Java in 1975 found that INPRES-SD school pupils were poorer than other&#13;
primary school pupils and the grade I drop-out rate in the 52 INPRES schools&#13;
in the study was about 14%, much higher than the 2% for the province as a&#13;
whole. The evidence from the SUSENAS data suggests that it is the children&#13;
from the lower socioeconomic classes who are more likely to lag behind their&#13;
peers in school. The deviation of actual year in school for a child compared&#13;
with the average for his age is related to the level of household income and&#13;
the level of educational attainment of the parents (see Appendix Tables 6&#13;
and 7).&#13;
The reasons for the high repetition and drop-out rates include the&#13;
small number of teaching hours (2 1/2 hours per day for grades I and II on&#13;
average, which is low even by Southeast Asian standards). This results from&#13;
multiple teaching jobs held by teachers to make up for the relatively low&#13;
salary scale. 1/ In some cases it is because teachers live in a different&#13;
village from where they teach and need to get to the school on foot or by&#13;
bicycle. In addition, the general practice is to use inexperienced teachers&#13;
to teach the first grade. There is suggestion from an experiment that when&#13;
more experienced teachers, with ten or more years of teaching, were used in&#13;
1/ One study reported that 35% of junior secondary school teachers&#13;
interviewed in the survey and 61% of senior secondary school teachers had more&#13;
than one job. (C.M. Widodo, Pendapatan Guru dengan Kerja Rangkap, BP3K,&#13;
March, 1978, p. 9). Even at the primary level, it is thought that 50% of&#13;
primary school teachers in urban areas teach in more than one school. (Douglas&#13;
Lamb and Ruth Daroesman, Financing Education, Central-Local Financial&#13;
Relations Review for the Government of Indonesia, Sectoral Study No. 6, March&#13;
1982).&#13;

the first grade, the repetition rate fell. It is also claimed that drop-out&#13;
rates have declined with the abolition of the school fee in the first three&#13;
grades and that similar results may be expected with the abolition of fees in&#13;
grades IV to VI. 1/&#13;
Although there is probably no excess demand for primary school&#13;
places, the problem is different for higher levels of schooling. There is&#13;
clearly excess demand for secondary school and university places. The recent&#13;
rapid increase in primary school enrollment has led to a sharp increase in the&#13;
demand for secondary education. As pointed out earlier, the private sector&#13;
has been very active and is now supplying about half of the total number of&#13;
places in the secondary schools and universities. Entry into these&#13;
institutions is dependent, first of all, on the ability to pay the costs which&#13;
include fees, uniforms, books and supplies, transportation and boarding&#13;
expenses, the last two items being more significant where schools or&#13;
universities are not locally available. Secondary schools which have more&#13;
applicants than places select the candidates on the basis of their grades or&#13;
entrance examination results. At the university level, four different sets of&#13;
selection procedures exist for state universities, three of them involving&#13;
examinations. To give some idea of the demand for places relative to the&#13;
supply, the centralized examination (PP1) for entry into the ten most&#13;
prestigious universities had 12 applicants for each place, while the PP4&#13;
system which selects students for the ten degree-granting teachers' colleges&#13;
1/ Heneveld, "Indonesian Education in the Seventies", p. 151.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
(IKIP's) had 4 applicants for each place in 1981. 1/ Secondary-school leavers&#13;
typically sit for more than one examination and those who can afford it also&#13;
apply to private universities. A number of applicants who are admitted to&#13;
private universities eventually turn these down if they are also offered&#13;
places in a state university.&#13;
Notwithstanding the government's success thus far in reducing the&#13;
inequality of access to schooling, considerable skewness remains in the&#13;
availability and use of educational facilities across different socioeconomic&#13;
groups: there is a definite urban bias in the provision of services,&#13;
especially at the higher levels (see Appendix Table 4), and the poor are more&#13;
likely to avail themselves of the lower levels of services. At the secondary&#13;
level, schools are more available in urban areas and many students from rural&#13;
areas have to live with urban relatives in order to attend. 2/ Government&#13;
investments in different levels of service will therefore affect different&#13;
socioeconomic groups unequally. If the investment is only to improve schools&#13;
without increasing enrollments, then higher income groups who already attend&#13;
will tend to benefit disproportionately; if the investment is to enlarge&#13;
enrollment capacity, then it will tend to help ever-lower income groups.&#13;

The Problem&#13;
The increase in the size of the education sector budget over the past&#13;
decade or so has been due mainly to the increase in the size of the total&#13;
central government budget itself and, to a smaller extent, to the rising share&#13;
of education in the total budget. The central government budget has grown&#13;
from around 14% of GDP in 1970/71 to 21% in 1980/81 1/, while the share of the&#13;
education sector in the budget has risen from 8.0% in 1975/76 to 8.9% in&#13;
1980/81 and 9.4% in 1982/83. 2/ Given the deteriorating financial situation&#13;
which now confronts Indonesia, in which government revenues are increasing at&#13;
a slower rate and the government faces an increasing budget deficit, it could&#13;
become more and more difficult to increase even the existing budget share&#13;
going to education which, by international and regional standards, is still&#13;
low.&#13;
The resource situation of the government in education has been&#13;
exacerbated by the fact that the proportion of costs recovered through school&#13;
fees in total recurrent expenditures has been declining. Not only were fees&#13;
abolished for primary schools in 1977 and 1978, but the degree of cost&#13;
recovery has gone down at the secondary and university levels as well (see&#13;
Table 1). Fee income per student in constant rupiah in 1980/81 was two-thirds&#13;
of the 1975/76 level for junior secondary and university students, and just&#13;

over one-half of the 1975/76 level for senior secondary students. Thus the&#13;
proportion of total recurrent expenditures recovered through fees has declined&#13;
substantially between 1975/76 and 1980/81: from 9% to 6% for junior secondary&#13;
students; from 20% to 10% for senior secondary students; and from 18% to 13%&#13;
for university students. 1/&#13;
In addition to the paramount task of at least defending the existing&#13;
share of the education budget in the total, the internal allocation of that&#13;
budget among competing objectives poses major problems for those in&#13;
government: to expand facilities at the secondary and tertiary levels; to&#13;
maintain the existing facilities and finance their operation; and to improve&#13;
the quality of its facilities at all levels.&#13;
In particular, recurrent expenditures, which hold the key to quality&#13;
improvement and maintenance, are likely to come under severe pressure over the&#13;
next few years. The massive investments in schools of the 1970's out of&#13;
INPRES necessarily entail recurrent expenditures to finance teachers'&#13;
salaries, teaching materials, maintenance of facilities and so on in&#13;
subsequent years. The experience of the period 1974/75-1979/80 suggests that&#13;
a Rp 100 expenditure from the capital budget for education in any given year&#13;
was associated with an incremental expenditure of Rp 18 in subsequent&#13;
recurrent annual budgets. However, for the period 1980/81-1990/91, when&#13;
allowance is made for improving the salaries of teachers, the correlated&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
increase in the annual level of total recurrent expenditure on education will&#13;
be approximately Rp 31 for every Rp 100 of capital expenditure. 1/&#13;
At this juncture, however, the investment program in education is&#13;
being stepped up. For example, there are plans to build 1,000 junior&#13;
secondary schools and 150 senior secondary schools in 1982/83, so that the&#13;
development budget allocation to the Directorate-General for Primary and&#13;
Secondary Education 2/ will more than double, jumping by Rp 190 billion&#13;
between 1981/82 and 1982/83 from Rp 185 billion to Rp 375 billion. These&#13;
capital expenditures have the effect of crowding out the routine budget, which&#13;
for this Directorate-General will increase by only 11% between 1981/82 and&#13;
1982/83. Yet assuming that 75% of the planned allocation in the development&#13;
budget for 1981/82 are for capital expenditures, an increase of Rp 26 billion&#13;
per year in the annual recurrent expenditure, a 15% increase over 1981/82, is&#13;
called for from these new investments alone. Similarly, the development&#13;
budget for the Directorate-General for Higher Education will rise by 40% while&#13;
the routine budget will increase by only 4% between 1981/82 and 1982/83. The&#13;
capital expenditures in 1981/82, however, would require that the increase in&#13;
the routine budget between 1981/82 and 1982/83 be 18%. Thus the facilities&#13;
now being completed, not to mention those that are being contemplated, will&#13;
put a tremendous burden on the future recurrent budgets.&#13;
In spite of the worsening financial situation, the government&#13;
nevertheless would like to show some growth, for example 8%, in the&#13;
development budget as a whole. The result will be a squeeze on the routine&#13;

budget, for the present as well as the future, both from the recurrent&#13;
expenditures associated with past capital expenditures and from the&#13;
contemplated allocation to the development budget. Indeed, all departments&#13;
have been instructed by the Ministry of Finance to hold their routine&#13;
expenditures for 1983/84 at the 1982/83 level, even though the size of the&#13;
development budgets for the Directorates-General for Primary and Secondary&#13;
Education and for Higher Education suggest that the routine budget would have&#13;
to increase by 27%. Under the present circumstances, the question can be&#13;
raised of whether some slowing down in the rate of expansion in facilities&#13;
might not be advisable in order that existing facilities can be maintained and&#13;
the quality of schooling already being provided can be upheld.&#13;
The allocation of funds between the capital and recurrent budgets&#13;
and, within each budget, among different levels of education also has&#13;
implications on equity. As will be seen later, different socioeconomic&#13;
classes use schooling facilities to different extents. Secondary and&#13;
university education tend to serve primarily the relatively well-to-do, while&#13;
primary education is more equitably enjoyed. Whether the government gives&#13;
priority to the improvement in quality of primary schools or to the expansion&#13;
of secondary schools and, if the latter, how it finances that expansion are&#13;
therefore decisions which affect different population groups to different&#13;
extents.&#13;
Finally, the inefficiencies in the system imply great cost to the&#13;
government. For example, repetition and drop-out in primary schools mean that&#13;
resources such as classrooms, teachers and teaching materials do not serve as&#13;
many children as they should be able to. Yet the worsening resource position&#13;
of the government makes it more crucial than ever for existing resources to be&#13;
used as efficiently as possible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
Financing&#13;
The education sector is by and large financed out of the budget of&#13;
the central government and private expenditures. However, we should&#13;
distinguish between private and public sector activities.&#13;
The private sector is a significant provider of services in&#13;
education.  Private secondary schools and universities now account for nearly&#13;
half of all the students; private primary schools are relatively less&#13;
significant, and account for roughly 15% of total enrollment. Private schools&#13;
and universities are run by foundations (jajasan) which raise funds, through&#13;
fees and other means, and manage the finances of the schools or&#13;
universities. Although some of them receive assistance from the government,&#13;
in the form of government teachers and so on, this is quite small, accounting&#13;
for less than 1% of the routine budget of the Department of Education and&#13;
Culture in 1982/83. 1/ Thus, except in those cases where the foundations have&#13;
other sources of funds, students finance their education entirely through&#13;
school or university fees and hardly any of them receive scholarships or any&#13;
other kind of assistance from the schools or universities. School fees in&#13;
private schools are high compared with those collected in comparable public&#13;
schools. For example, a private senior secondary school in Nusatenggara Timur&#13;
collects Rp 2,500 per month compared with Rp 500 in a public senior secondary&#13;
school in the same district. A secretarial academy in Jakarta charges fees of&#13;
Rp 250,000 for the whole year although it does not collect entrance fees or&#13;

other levies. Private university entrance fees can amount to millions of&#13;
rupiah, while annual fees could be Rp 150,000-200,000.&#13;
Public primary schools are the responsibility of the Department of&#13;
Home Affairs, while public secondary schools and universities come under the&#13;
Department of Education and Culture. The teachers' salaries are paid for by&#13;
the central government and fees (SPP or Sumbangan Pembinaan Pendidikan) are&#13;
collected from secondary school and university students by the schools and&#13;
deposited directly into branches of the state bank (kas negara). 1/ In the&#13;
public primary schools, school fees were abolished in 1977 for grades I to III&#13;
and in 1978 for grades IV to VI. Primary schools receive SPP compensation&#13;
allocations (DPP) which are a subsidy provided by the central government to&#13;
make up for the school fees that schools would have collected under the old&#13;
system. Although there is a provision for exempting students from fees, only&#13;
2% of all secondary school and university students benefit from this. 2/ In&#13;
theory a child may be exempted from paying fees, but in practice they have to&#13;
1/ There are ten categories of SPP fees for each of the junior secondary and&#13;
senior secondary levels. The school principal and the provincial Office of&#13;
Education decide jointly on which category a school belongs to; a change in&#13;
the category has to be approved by both the Ministry of Finance and the&#13;
Department of Education and Culture.&#13;

provide a certificate of indigence from village authorities (the lurah). 1/&#13;
The central government retains 7% of the fee income and returns the remaining&#13;
93% to the provincial offices of the Department of Education and Culture (in&#13;
the form of DPP allocations). 2/ Public students thus receive government&#13;
subsidies which are at least equal to the per student recurrent expenditure&#13;
less fees. It has been estimated that, in 1970, public primary and junior&#13;
secondary schools depended on fees for 17% of their recurrent expenditures,&#13;
while public senior secondary schools depended on fees for 30% of these.&#13;
Aside from the fees, the level of which is set for each school, there&#13;
are a number of other fees paid directly to the schools, such as entrance&#13;
fees 3/, examination fees, and other contributions. In addition, each public&#13;
school has associated with it a BP3 (Badan Pembantu Penyelenggaraan Pendidikan&#13;
or Educational Aid Association); its job is to help raise funds to supplement&#13;
the income of the school, and specifically to cover the shortfall in school&#13;
needs when compared with DPP funds received from the central government,&#13;
especially since these often arrive late. Parents have no say on how DPP&#13;
funds are used, while they do participate in the decisions concerning the&#13;
collection and use of BP3 fees through their membership in the BP3.&#13;
In addition to the direct costs which students pay to schools and&#13;
universities, there are a number of indirect costs which are incurred by all&#13;
students whether they attend private or public schools: the cost of books and&#13;

other supplies, the cost of uniforms, transportation to and from school, and&#13;
pocket money. In a survey of students it was found that, for junior and&#13;
senior secondary education respectively, school fees accounted for 13% and 15%&#13;
of all expenses (excluding foregone earnings); BP3 fees for 5% and 7%; books&#13;
and supplies for 21% and 14%; cost of uniforms for 14% and 11%; transportation&#13;
for 13% and 18%; and pocket money for 26% in both cases. 1/ Moreover, there&#13;
are boarding fees for those students who have to live away from home in order&#13;
to attend school. For example, for a certain senior secondary school in&#13;
Nusatenggara Timur, the fees for the boarding house are Rp 12,000 per month&#13;
plus 10 kg of rice. This compares with a tuition fee of Rp 2,500 per&#13;
month. 2/ Boarding fees in Jakarta for students in a secretarial academy who&#13;
come from other provinces are around Rp 50,000 per month.&#13;
Who Gets What?&#13;
In this section we are concerned only with government expenditures on&#13;
education and payments to the government by parents on behalf of their&#13;
children. This reflects the strategic implications of government provision of&#13;
social services on the budgetary capacity and on the allocation of government&#13;
subsidies to different socioeconomic groups. We first examine the existing&#13;
situation and then explore in the next section the budgetary and equity&#13;

implications of a number of policy options which may come under consideration&#13;
by the government.&#13;
School enrollment rates vary by income class and geographical&#13;
location. The reasons are the differences in socioeconomic background, which&#13;
explain variations in the demand for and ability to pay the private costs of&#13;
schooling, and supply considerations like the availability, price, distance&#13;
and quality of the facilities. School enrollment rates do not vary much at&#13;
the primary level; most children of primary-school age attend school, although&#13;
the ones who stay out are also the ones from poor families whose parents are&#13;
themselves uneducated. Primary education is largely provided by the&#13;
government; so in general primary school subsidies are expected to be&#13;
reasonably equally distributed.&#13;
At higher levels of schooling, matters are quite different. Since&#13;
only about 50% of an age cohort graduate from primary schools, secondary and&#13;
university education are totally irrelevant for the remaining 50%. If&#13;
students in secondary schools and universities are not paying their own way&#13;
completely, then the 35% who enter secondary schools and the roughly 3% who&#13;
attend universities become the only potential direct beneficiaries of the&#13;
subsidies that the government provides at these levels.&#13;
In 1982/83, fully three-quarters of the budget of the Department of&#13;
Education and Culture were going to the Directorate-General for Primary and&#13;
Secondary Education and the Directorate-General for Higher Education. The net&#13;
costs per student to the government, both capital and recurrent, are greater&#13;
at higher levels of schooling, even though the fee incomes collected are also&#13;
greater in absolute terms and as proportions of government recurrent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

expenditures. Table 2 gives the recurrent expenditures and fee incomes&#13;
collected from students for different levels of education.&#13;
Appendix Tables 8, 9 and 10 represent an attempt to answer the&#13;
question of which groups in Indonesian society are benefiting from the&#13;
government provision of education. Households have been classified by&#13;
economic class, urban/rural area of residence and whether they are in Java or&#13;
the Outer Islands. The classification of economic class into the poorest 40%,&#13;
middle 30% and richest 30% of households is based on their level of per capita&#13;
expenditures. The distribution of the households according to this&#13;
classification scheme can be seen in the first panel of Appendix Table 8.&#13;
Appendix Table 8 also gives the shares of school-age children&#13;
corresponding to different levels of schooling, namely primary, junior&#13;
secondary, senior secondary and university, based on the offical age groups&#13;
(7-12; 13-15; 16-18 and 19-25). At all levels there are under-age and over-&#13;
age students, especially the latter, but the shares by household group at&#13;
least takes into account variations in household sizes, and the numbers and&#13;
age distribution of school-age children. That the size and composition of&#13;
households make a difference to the shares of school-age children in different&#13;
household groups can be seen by comparing the different panels in Appendix&#13;
Table 8.&#13;
Variations in enrollment rates and in the proportions of students in&#13;
public schools across household groups mean that the distribution of&#13;
government subsidies in education across household groups will be different&#13;
from the distribution of school-age children. The first panel of Appendix&#13;
Table 9 gives the distribution of all students across household groups by&#13;
level of schooling. This can be compared with the distribution of school-age&#13;

children in Appendix Table 8; the differences between them reflect variations&#13;
in school enrollment rates across household economic classes, area and region&#13;
of residence. The second panel of Appendix Table 9 gives the distribution of&#13;
public students across household groups by level of schooling. The SUSENAS&#13;
data do not actually give any information on whether a child is enrolled in a&#13;
public or private school. The assumption that has been made here is that&#13;
children from the poorest 40% of households all go to public schools. Using&#13;
the proportion of all students at each level in public schools, we can then&#13;
calculate the proportion in the middle and richest classes of households who&#13;
go to public schools; this is lower at each level of schooling than the&#13;
overall figure for Indonesia since all the private students have been put into&#13;
these classes. 1/&#13;
Since we use in the calculation of the distribution of subsidies the&#13;
average subsidy per public student at each level of schooling across all&#13;
household economic classes, areas and regions, the distribution of subsidies&#13;

at each level of schooling across household groups is the same as the&#13;
distribution of public students. However, when we sum across schooling&#13;
levels, the distribution of subsidies for all levels of schooling combined&#13;
takes into account differences in the average sudsidies per public student&#13;
across schooling levels. The distributions of subsidies across household&#13;
groups for each level of education and for all levels combined are given in&#13;
Appendix Table 10.&#13;
The crude allocation of subsidies presented in Appendix Table 10&#13;
shows that primary-school subsidies are more or less equitably distributed:&#13;
their shares correspond closely to the shares of primary school-age children&#13;
in the different household groups. This is not surprising, given the high&#13;
overall enrollment rates in primary schools and the fact that the vast&#13;
majority of the children attend public schools.&#13;
At higher levels of schooling, the shares of subsidies become more&#13;
and more biased towards the better-off households. Under the assumptions&#13;
being made, children in the upper income classes account for 28% and 33% of&#13;
the junior and senior secondary school-age groups but would receive 33% and&#13;
55% of the subsidies at these levels. Similarly, urban children account for&#13;
20% and 23% of the junior and senior secondary school-age groups while&#13;
receiving 29% and 50% of the subsidies. University subsidies are heavily&#13;
biased towards rich urban households. The upper classes in urban areas&#13;
receive 71% of university subsidies; they only account for 14% of the relevant&#13;
age group. And this is after we have taken into account the fact that roughly&#13;
half of them attend private institutions.&#13;
To conclude, if the assumptions given are valid, primary school&#13;
subsidies are more or less equally distributed, with the poorest classes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
receiving slightly more than their share of the total based on the number of&#13;
primary school-age children. At the secondary level, urban children are able&#13;
to take advantage of the government subsidies while at the university level&#13;
nearly all the benefits accrue to the urban upper classes, even though we have&#13;
made the assumption that all the children from the poorest households attend&#13;
public institutions and hence receive the government subsidies.&#13;
In general, urban households receive shares of subsidies greater than&#13;
what would be expected given their shares of school-age children, while rural&#13;
households receive smaller shares. Similarly, children in the Outer Islands&#13;
receive greater shares of subsidies than children in Java compared with their&#13;
shares of school-age children, reflecting the generally higher enrollment&#13;
rates there, the exception being at the university level. The fact that urban&#13;
Java, which accounts for 14% of university-age students, receives 57% of&#13;
university subsidies gives Java as a whole a slightly larger share of&#13;
university subsidies than would be expected from its share of university-age&#13;
students.&#13;
Policy Options&#13;
The tightening overall financial situation is a matter of pressing&#13;
concern to the government, given that a strong case can be made for continuing&#13;
to allocate a large share of government revenues to education. The present&#13;
level of facilities is still inadequate. Primary education is not yet&#13;
universal in the upper grades, and enrollments at the secondary and university&#13;
levels are still low by international standards. Physical access to schools&#13;
is far from equal across different geographical regions and the poor generally&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
receive less schooling. There is need for further expansion in educational&#13;
facilities for many years to come. Moreover, the existing facilities are not&#13;
being adequately maintained since insufficient resources are allocated for&#13;
this purpose. Finally, the quality of service is low and ways need to be&#13;
found for quality improvement.&#13;
Three issues confront the education planners at this juncture.&#13;
First, what resources should be available to the sector and how they should be&#13;
financed. Second, what the equity trade-off is between further expansion and&#13;
the upkeep of, as well as improvement in, existing facilities, especially at&#13;
higher levels. Third, how to find ways of using the available resources more&#13;
efficiently.&#13;
With regard to the financing of education, one option available to&#13;
the government is to foster further growth in private sector activities. The&#13;
justification for providing government assistance to private schools is the&#13;
same as that for giving subsidies to students in public schools: when the&#13;
private demand for schooling is lower than the social demand, then subsidies&#13;
are used to achieve the socially optimal level of schooling. The private&#13;
sector is already very active in the provision of secondary and university&#13;
education but so far the government has had a relatively passive, rather than&#13;
an active, role in promoting its growth. In this connection, it becomes&#13;
important for the government to define its role clearly in order to cooperate&#13;
with or complement rather than compete with the private sector. Does the&#13;
government see its role as providing basic school facilities to all children&#13;
or is it to fill the gaps left by the private sector? In primary education,&#13;
it has definitely opted for the former. Has it decided to do the same with&#13;
secondary education and, if so, is it appropriate? Might not the government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
encourage the growth of private secondary schools in all areas, for example,&#13;
while itself concentrating just on rural areas? Should it provide tax&#13;
incentives to private schools?    Should the government consider its role to be&#13;
one of setting standards for the quality of schooling and not concern itself&#13;
with regulating the profitability of private schools? The present very low&#13;
rate of cost recovery in the provision of public education (Table 2) suggests&#13;
that giving incentives to the private sector to build schools and spending&#13;
resources on supervising them may be a way of expanding the system which puts&#13;
less strain on the fiscal system and gets a higher return on investment.&#13;
Another financing option is to consider whether there are&#13;
possibilities of raising revenues from within the education sector itself.&#13;
This is a critical issue and will be explored here in some detail, since&#13;
consideration must also be given to the issue of equity.&#13;
At present only 3% of the recurrent expenditures going to the&#13;
provision of public education are recovered through fee collection. 1/ What&#13;
would be the implications on the budget and on distributional equity of&#13;
changes in the fee structure? The fee income is now collected only at the&#13;
secondary and university levels but passed to the Treasury for holding. For&#13;
the secondary schools, it is returned as a fund (DPP) to the provinces for&#13;
each school to apply for on the basis of an agreed "use plan". For the&#13;
universities the funds are returned directly to the universities for use&#13;
1/ This is the total fee income at the junior secondary, senior secondary and&#13;
university levels as a percentage of the sum of total fee income and total&#13;
government subsidies for all four levels. See Table 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
according to an agreed plan. 1/ DPP allocations are also made for primary&#13;
education even though fees have been abolished. In 1980/81. the DPP&#13;
allocation at the primary level came to more than half of the total DPP&#13;
allocation, while junior secondary, senior secondary and university education&#13;
took nearly equal shares of the remainder. The weight of primary education in&#13;
the total DPP allocation is due to sheer numbers; primary education accounted&#13;
for 87% of all public school students in 1980/81, even though the DPP&#13;
allocation per student is far smaller than those for the higher levels (see&#13;
Table 3).&#13;
The abolition of fees at the primary level accounts for something&#13;
like 3% of the routine expenditures for education which are no longer&#13;
recovered. 2/ What must be weighed against this apparent drain on the budget&#13;
are the following factors. First, because primary school enrollment is high&#13;
and relatively equitably distributed and those enrolled in private schools are&#13;
likely to be children of the well-to-do, the subsidies to public primary&#13;
school students are such that the poor get slightly more than their share&#13;
based on the numbers of primary school-age children. Second, parents are&#13;
already contributing to the total cost of primary education through informal&#13;
fees paid to the schools, BP3 fees, uniforms, books and supplies,&#13;
transportation and so on. These can be quite a burden for poor households.&#13;
1/ The DPP allocation for secondary and university education was 103% of SPP&#13;
income over the period 1975 to 1980/81. (Bureau of Planning, Department of&#13;
Education and Culture).&#13;
2/ This is estimated as the DPP allocation to primary education as a&#13;
percentage of the sum of total fee income and total government subsidies for&#13;
all schooling levels. See Table 3.&#13;

Third, enrollment rates, even at the primary level, are related to the&#13;
socioeconomic background of the children. Those children with poor and/or&#13;
uneducated parents have a lower chance of enrolling and fees are likely to&#13;
reduce enrollment among them further. Fourth, a child who is deprived of&#13;
primary education is also automatically barred from secondary and university&#13;
education. Thus it can be argued that what has been lost through the&#13;
abolition of the fees at the primary level has been gained in terms of greater&#13;
equity. Indeed, if equity and efficiency alike at the primary level are&#13;
important objectives, then the case can be made for even greater subsidies&#13;
which would be used to increase further the enrollment and continuation rates&#13;
of children from poorer families in the upper grades of primary schools.&#13;
An increase in fees at the secondary and university levels, however,&#13;
has the potential to improve equity by reducing subsidies to upper income&#13;
students while also raising revenues. To consider first the question of&#13;
revenues, Table 4 gives the degree of cost recovery through fees projected&#13;
through 1990/91 based on assumptions of constant, as well as increasing, per&#13;
student recurrent expenditures. Fees for secondary schools and universities&#13;
are assumed to be kept at existing levels, or to be gradually increased such&#13;
that the levels are doubled or quadrupled by 1990/91. (Details of the&#13;
calculations are given in Appendix Table 11).&#13;
Because of the change in the distribution of students over time&#13;
towards the higher levels of education (see Appendix Table 11), where a&#13;
greater proportion of the costs are recovered, the overall degree of cost&#13;
recovery will increase from 2.5% to 4.6% of recurrent expenditures if both the&#13;
per student recurrent expenditure and fee at each level remain unchanged in&#13;
real terms (see Table 4). If fees are doubled or quadrupled by 1990/91, the&#13;
degree of cost recovery will increase to 9% and 19% respectively by 1990/91.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
However, if per student recurrent expenditures are increased at&#13;
approximately 5.5% per year, for example in order to increase teachers'&#13;
salaries or to provide more teaching materials, then the increase in per&#13;
student recurrent expenditures offsets the shift in the distribution of&#13;
students towards the categories with greater cost recovery in such a way that&#13;
the overall degree of cost recovery remains more or less constant. However,&#13;
doubling or quadrupling fees will result in increasing cost recovery to 5.4%&#13;
or 10.8% by 1990/91.&#13;
The case can be made for increasing secondary and university fees&#13;
simply because, between 1975/76 and 1980/81, fee income per student increased&#13;
by only 26% for junior secondary and university students and by 3% for senior&#13;
secondary students in nominal terms (see Table 1). Consequently, it fell in&#13;
real terms by roughly one-third for junior secondary and university students&#13;
and by nearly one-half for senior secondary students. To give an example of&#13;
the orders of magnitude involved in fee increases, an immediate doubling of&#13;
fees, without taking into account any decline in enrollment, would increase&#13;
resources by 2% in the education budget as a whole, or 3% in the recurrent&#13;
budget. This figure has to be seen in relation to the routine budget of the&#13;
Department of Education and Culture. In 1980/81, nonsalary expenditures&#13;
amounted to a mere 15% of the routine budget excluding fees, or Rp 46&#13;
billion 1/; total fee income from secondary and university education came to&#13;

Table 13.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
Rp 29 billion and thus could potentially augment the nonsalary expenditures by&#13;
63%. 1/&#13;
The DPP allocation out of fee income is important precisely because&#13;
it constitutes a major part of the nonsalary expenditures in education. For&#13;
example, for the secondary school DPP allocation between 1975 and 1980/81,&#13;
only 26% went to honoraria for school staff, while 35% went to teaching&#13;
materials. In 1981/82, Rp 4 billion were allocated to maintenance in the&#13;
budget of the Directorate-General for Primary and Secondary Education which&#13;
excluded SPP fees at that time. This was matched by the allocation out of DPP&#13;
funds to maintenance and utilities (Rp 4 billion in 1980/81), most of which&#13;
went to the schools (83% in 1980/81). 2/&#13;
In terms of the government's concern that an increase in fees would&#13;
exclude children from poor households and hence reduce enrollments, it is&#13;
important to recognize the extent to which they are already excluded at the&#13;
secondary and university levels. Children from the richest 30% of households&#13;
in urban areas account for 71% of all university students, while representing&#13;
only 14% of university-age (19 to 25) children. They also make up 37% of all&#13;
senior secondary school students and only 15% of the children in this age&#13;
group (16-18). (See Appendix Tables 8 and 9). Thus the increase in fee would&#13;
have its biggest impact on the urban upper classes. Moreover, on average fees&#13;

2/ Bureau of Planning, Department of Education and Culture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
account for only 13% and 15% of all schooling expenses at the junior and&#13;
senior secondary levels. 1/&#13;
This is not to say that an increase in fees would not adversely&#13;
affect enrollment of poor children. Using data from SUSENAS 1978, we have&#13;
estimated the fee burden on different household groups of sending their&#13;
children to school. The results are shown in Appendix Table 12. In the top&#13;
panel, the school tuition fees reportedly paid by households in different&#13;
economic classes, areas and regions are given as percentages of the household&#13;
discretionary budget, defined as total household expenditure less expenditures&#13;
on essentials, namely food, housing and clothing. It can be seen that&#13;
households in different economic classes in rural areas do not differ a great&#13;
deal in terms of the proportions of the discretionary budget spent on tuition&#13;
fees; however, among urban households the burden is clearly greater for the&#13;
poorer households. This is true in the Outer Islands as well as Java.&#13;
The second panel gives as percentages of the discretionary budget the&#13;
total fees that would be required in order to enroll all children between ages&#13;
7 and 18 in school at the levels corresponding to the official age groups.&#13;
Except for the urban upper classes, these estimated fees are greater than what&#13;
households are actually paying. The gap is greater for poorer households,&#13;
especially in rural areas. For example, poor households in rural areas of the&#13;
Outer Islands currently spend 4% of their discretionary budgets on school&#13;
fees. To enroll all their children between ages 7 and 18 in school they would&#13;
need to spend 41% of their discretionary budgets. Households, especially poor&#13;
1/ Waskito Tjiptosasmito and William K. Cummings, The Status of Deployment of&#13;
Teachers in Indonesia, Table 3.15.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
ones, have already adjusted their demand for schooling down to what they are&#13;
able to pay by sending fewer of their children to school. It can be expected&#13;
that an increase in school fees would adversely affect enrollment rates among&#13;
them.&#13;
To ease the burden on poorer households, consideration should be&#13;
given to an expansion in the provision of student loans and scholarships, as&#13;
well as greater use of school fee reduction or rescission than is now done.&#13;
However, loan schemes are complex and some argue that they are not cost&#13;
effective because of the high administrative costs and loan defaults. At&#13;
present, the scholarship program is very small and benefits roughly one in a&#13;
thousand students. University student loans are only granted for continuation&#13;
in the university and so do not help students who cannot afford to enter in&#13;
the first place. If fees were to be doubled, then one in a hundred senior&#13;
secondary and university students could be given full scholarships and still&#13;
leave 88% of the fee increase for other purposes. The government could also&#13;
give more dormitory subsidies since boarding expenses are a major part of the&#13;
cost of schooling for students who have to live away from home.&#13;
Given the equity objectives of the government and the limited&#13;
resources which are available to the education sector, it is important to give&#13;
due consideration to the trade-off between, for example, a greater&#13;
concentration of efforts in improving enrollment rates at the primary level&#13;
among the poor and the expansion of secondary education.&#13;
The problems discussed above concerning the obstacles to universal&#13;
primary education suggest that something more than providing school places&#13;
will be required in order to achieve this objective. The government is well&#13;
aware of this and already has a number of programs which are designed to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
tackle this problem. Consideration will be given to compulsory primary&#13;
education in Repelita IV; a pilot project for this has been instituted in one&#13;
kecamatan per kabupaten. The academic calendar will be rearranged where&#13;
necessary so as not to conflict with harvest time. Flexible school hours are&#13;
being considered. The "small school" program has remote areas in mind and&#13;
there is a special program to enroll primary-school drop-outs, as well as&#13;
those over the primary-school age.&#13;
Grade repetition at the primary level represents a waste in&#13;
government resources; thus it is encouraging that there has been a significant&#13;
decline in repetition rates in primary schools over the last few years.    It&#13;
would be worthwhile to consider what improvements in the quality of teaching&#13;
would enable a greater proportion of entrants into the first grade to complete&#13;
six years of schooling: using teachers who are more qualified and with more&#13;
years of teaching, ensuring longer hours of instruction, and providing the&#13;
necessary teaching materials.&#13;
To the extent that the quality of education is in large part related&#13;
to the qualifications of the teachers and the number of teaching hours, it&#13;
would be desirable to examine if the present levels of compensation for&#13;
teachers should be increased. Although this will have the effect of&#13;
increasing the routine budget considerably, the benefits in terms of&#13;
improvement in quality and reduction in repetition and drop-out rates may well&#13;
be worth the cost.&#13;
In any case, greater incentives for teachers working in remote areas&#13;
are probably necessary. At present the government is already trying to&#13;
provide housing for teachers working in such locations. In Irian Jaya and&#13;
East Timor, monetary incentives are also given in addition to cost-of-living&#13;
adjustments which apply to all areas.&#13;

III. Health&#13;
The Record&#13;
The government's objectives in the health sector are articulated in&#13;
its Long-Term Health Development Plan. 1/ All activities in health&#13;
development are for the purpose of achieving a higher standard of health so&#13;
that everyone may live productively. More extensive, uniform and accessible&#13;
health facilities are being sought, especially for the low-income population,&#13;
whether in rural or urban areas. More extensive participation in health&#13;
activities is also being pursued.&#13;
Consistent with the goal of "Health for All by the Year 2000",&#13;
specific quantitative targets have been set in the Long-Term Health&#13;
Development Plan. By the year 2000, life expectation at birth is expected to&#13;
reach 60 years; the infant mortality rate is expected to be 45 per thousand&#13;
live births and the mortality rate for children under age 5 is expected to&#13;
decline from 40 per thousand in 1980 to 15 per thousand. 2/&#13;
As in the education sector, the government has made remarkable&#13;
progress in the provision of facilities in the health sector. For example,&#13;
the number of public health centers (PUSKESMAS) more than doubled between the&#13;
period 1973/74 and 1980/81, while the numbers of doctors and nurses increased&#13;
by 68% and 109% respectively between 1973/74 and 1978/79. The government's&#13;
concern for distributional aspects in the provision of facilities has been&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
reflected in the rule governing the construction of public health centers that&#13;
every subdistrict should eventually have a public health center; at the end of&#13;
Repelita II, about 80% of the subdistricts already had public health centers&#13;
and 800 more centers are planned for Repelita III. In 1977, the government&#13;
also lowered the public health center fee, which previously had been set by&#13;
the local authorities and showed great regional variations, to Rp 150 for all&#13;
areas of the country. In this regard, the government again showed its concern&#13;
for an equitable provision of services by attempting to ensure that the poor&#13;
would be able to afford to use the services provided by the public health&#13;
centers.&#13;
Although private health centers exist, most of the health centers&#13;
belong to the government; private hospitals, however, are a significant&#13;
proportion of the total, accounting for 48% of all hospitals and 28% of&#13;
hospital beds in 1980.&#13;
However, a great deal remains to be done in the health sector.&#13;
Although indicators of the health status for the population have shown big&#13;
improvements, the present levels are still low. The infant mortality rate&#13;
(for ages below one year) has dropped from 137 per thousand live births in&#13;
1961-1971 to 100 per thousand live births in 1980 which is still high, with&#13;
50% of infant deaths occurring during the first month. 1/ Life expectation at&#13;
birth is expected to have risen from 46.5 years for males and 49.4 years for&#13;
1/ Sistem Kesehatan Nasional, p. 29.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
females in 1976-1981 to 48.9 years for males and 51.9 years for females in&#13;
1981-1985. 1/ This compares with 60 years for all middle-income countries.&#13;
The utilization rates for health services are low in Indonesia; the&#13;
average number of visits to any type of health facility is 2.1 per capita per&#13;
year, of which 0.3 are to private doctors, 0.4 are to hospitals, and 0.5 are&#13;
to public health centers. Although there are now more than three times as&#13;
many physicians relative to the size of the population compared with 1960,&#13;
each physician serves on average 14,000 people and each nursing person 9,000&#13;
people compared with 5,800 and 2,500 for middle-income countries taken as a&#13;
whole. 2/&#13;
Whereas in the education sector, students can only avail themselves&#13;
of higher levels of schooling if they have successfully graduated from the&#13;
next lower level, there is no similar qualifying barrier in health, even&#13;
though public health services are based on a referral system. Rather, any&#13;
reluctance to use the higher levels of service, such as hospitals, is due to&#13;
the relative direct and indirect costs of visits and to lack of access to the&#13;
facilities. Government hospitals have 75% of their beds in classes II, III&#13;
and IV and private hospitals are required to put aside 25% of their in-patient&#13;
capacity in classes III and IV for poorer patients. In spite of these&#13;
provisions, the poor, especially those in rural areas, rarely use the higher-&#13;
level health facilities.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
Even though the nominal fee for a visit to a public health center is&#13;
low (Rp 150), in practice there are other charges such as drug&#13;
prescriptions. In a study in Karanganyar district in Central Java, the&#13;
average cost of a visit to a rural public health center in 1980 was found to&#13;
be Rp 209; the daily per capita income in the district was Rp 202 in&#13;
1979/80. 1/ The 1980 Household Health Survey 2/ found the average direct cost&#13;
to the patient of a visit to a public health center to be Rp 418, the figure&#13;
for rural areas of Central Java being Rp 251 which is quite comparable to the&#13;
Karanganyar study. Additional costs related to the visit are incurred, such&#13;
as transportation and loss of income in making the visits. These costs are&#13;
more critical to the poor. In a study of hospital costs, the associated costs&#13;
which included transportation, extra food for the patient, and lodging for&#13;
accompanying relatives amounted to 19% of the direct costs. 3/&#13;
While the availability of health facilities has definitely increased,&#13;
as witnessed by the fact that geographical access was cited as a reason for&#13;
not seeking treatment less frequently in 1980 compared with 1972 4/, it is&#13;
nevertheless estimated that less than 50% of the population is reached by&#13;

government or private health services. 1/ It is also the case that the&#13;
average number of visits to public health centers is related to the average&#13;
area served by them; the latter would be linked to the average distance of&#13;
households to a center. In provinces of Java and Bali, where each center&#13;
serves on average an area smaller than 100 sq. km., the average number of&#13;
visits is 55 per day; in ten other provinces, where each serves an area&#13;
between 100 and 500 sq. km. in size, the figure is 29 per day; and in the&#13;
remaining provinces it is only 23 per day. 2/ Thus lack of access to public&#13;
health centers is a bigger problem in the Outer Islands than in Java.&#13;
Finally, the quality of service in the public health centers is&#13;
discouragingly low: health personnel is inadequate and lacks supervision; the&#13;
public health centers are not always open; drug supplies are often inadequate&#13;
and so on. 3/&#13;
The Problem&#13;
In the health sector, the government faces a similar problem as it&#13;
does in education of how to expand hospitals and other facilities, maintain&#13;
and operate the public health centers and hospitals, and improve the quality&#13;
of services at all levels. The share of health in the government budget is&#13;

health centers lasts ranges from 3 months to 8 months.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
already low at 2% and the prospects for an increase are probably not good at&#13;
this time.&#13;
How to allocate the resources available to the health sector between&#13;
the capital and recurrent budgets is a serious problem for the government. As&#13;
pointed out earlier in the section on education, the level of recurrent&#13;
expenditures for a given size of past investment implies certain standards of&#13;
maintenance and quality. Once capital expenditures have been made, the&#13;
attempt to hold down the routine budget therefore probably means a sacrifice&#13;
in terms of the quality of service provided. Moreover, the manner in which&#13;
funds are allocated among competing objectives will have implications for&#13;
equity, given the differential uses of different types and levels of services&#13;
by different population groups.&#13;
Financing&#13;
In the health sector, private services are provided by private&#13;
doctors, both modern and traditional, private hospitals and clinics, a large&#13;
number of private maternity centers, and a small number of private health&#13;
centers. The government provides services through the government hospitals,&#13;
public health centers and subcenters, and community health volunteers. As in&#13;
the case of education, government assistance to private hospitals is&#13;
negligible, amounting to less than 1% of the total Ministry of Health budget,&#13;
so that private patients taken as a whole pay in full for hospital services.&#13;
For each public health center visit there is a fee of Rp 150 which is supposed&#13;
to cover the medical examination and drugs. In a few places the fee is less&#13;
than Rp 150 and in Irian Jaya the service is provided free of charge.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
Hospital in-patients pay according to the class of hospital room and the&#13;
treatment received. For public services considerable additional private costs&#13;
are still incurred: drugs prescribed by the doctor, transportation and so&#13;
on. Finally, some 10% of the population, consisting of civil servants and&#13;
pensioners, their spouses and children, are covered by health insurance&#13;
(ASKES) which is financed out of a withholding of 2% of their salaries or&#13;
pensions.&#13;
Regulation requires that revenues from public health center and&#13;
government hospital fees be sent to the appropriate level of government. In&#13;
some places, the local government allows the public health centers to retain a&#13;
certain proportion of the total fees collected.&#13;
There are three levels of financing operating costs for government&#13;
health services: national, provincial and local (kabupaten/kotamadya). Very&#13;
roughly speaking, the APBN (national) budget finances central (i.e. Ministry&#13;
of Health) hospitals; the APBD I (provincial) budget finances provincial&#13;
hospitals; while the APBD II (kabupaten/kotamadya) budget finances kabupaten&#13;
hospitals and the public health centers. In a study of health service&#13;
finance 1/, it was found that at least 93%, and probably as much as 97%, of&#13;
the total health allocations in 1980/81 came from the central government&#13;
budget and fees, with the remainder being attributable to the regional&#13;
development budgets. The breakdown in Appendix Table 13 shows that at least&#13;
83% of total health allocations come from the central government through the&#13;

1980.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
central budgets or salaries of health workers paid through the Ministry of&#13;
Finance. Fees from ASKES and general patients amount to 10% of the total.&#13;
Roughly 60% (Rp 171.4 billion) of the total allocation of Rp 286.3&#13;
billion is estimated to be in the routine budget, with the development budget&#13;
accounting for the remaining 40% (Rp 114.9 billion). The breakdown of the&#13;
routine budget and fees by level of government is shown in Table 5.&#13;
Approximately 38% of the health budget go to hospitals while 28% go to public&#13;
health centers. 1/ Making the assumption that two-thirds of the routine&#13;
budget at each level is allocated to health care, we have estimated the total&#13;
subsidies to be of the order of Rp 96 billion, with the proportion of total&#13;
health care expenditures recovered through user fees being 23%. What is&#13;
particularly interesting and makes the issue in health different from that in&#13;
education is that the degree of cost recovery at the local level which&#13;
provides the lower level of services (public health centers and kabupaten&#13;
hospitals) is far greater (36%) than that for the higher levels of services&#13;
involving primarily Ministry of Health and provincial hospitals (12%).&#13;
Who Gets What?&#13;
We compare in Appendix Table 14 the shares of people in different&#13;
household groups who were sick at any time during a period of one week with&#13;
the shares of these who visited a public health center, a hospital or a doctor&#13;

in private practice. 1/ The middle income classes in rural areas are the main&#13;
users of public health centers; hospital visits are made by the upper income&#13;
classes in both urban and rural areas, as are visits to private doctors.&#13;
Unfortunately, we are unable to obtain a breakdown of hospital visits into&#13;
out-patient and in-patient visits. Thus we cannot take into account the fact&#13;
that higher-income patients are more likely to use hospitals for out-patient&#13;
visits while the poor would use public health centers for this purpose.&#13;
In order to get very crude estimates of the subsidies going to the&#13;
different household groups, we divide the routine budget allocated to health&#13;
care between hospitals (Rp 71.846 billion) and public health centers&#13;
(Rp 52.940 billion).  For hospitals it is assumed that 12% are recovered&#13;
through fees, based on the degree of cost recovery at the APBN and APBD I&#13;
levels. Subsidies going to hospitals are thus estimated to be approximately&#13;
Rp 63.224 billion. The rest of the subsidies, Rp 32.289 billion, are assumed&#13;
to go to public health centers, with the degree of cost recovery being 39%.&#13;
The 1980 Census contained a question on whether individuals had felt&#13;
unwell during the week preceding the census date, and whether and where they&#13;
had sought treatment. This allows us to estimate the annual numbers of visits&#13;
to hospitals and public health centers, as well as other places of&#13;
treatment. In 1980, roughly 56 million visits were made to hospitals, of&#13;
which 42 million would be to government hospitals, and 80 million visits to&#13;
1/ The results are based on 1978 SUSENAS data.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
public health centers. 1/ The average subsidy for a government hospital visit&#13;
is thus estimated to be approximately Rp 1,500, while that for a public health&#13;
center visit is roughly Rp 400. Appendix Table 15 gives the shares of health&#13;
care subsidies going to different household groups under these assumptions&#13;
concerning the sizes of subsidies. The household groups that receive more&#13;
than their share (based on the total number reporting being sick during the&#13;
survey week) are the better-off households, namely the middle and upper&#13;
economic classes, particularly urban households. An implicit assumption made&#13;
here is that the same proportion of people who are sick report sickness&#13;
whether they are poor or rich. If instead it is the case, which is likely,&#13;
that the poor are less likely to report sickness than the rich, then the poor&#13;
get even less than their proportionate share of subsidies based on their need&#13;
for health services.&#13;
In a study of the two class A hospitals 2/, it has been observed that&#13;
patients who have greater financial resources stay longer in the hospital, as&#13;
do those whose bills are paid by a third party, such as an insurance company&#13;
or employers. This would suggest that actual inequalities in the distribution&#13;
of subsidies in health care by household groups are likely to be even greater&#13;
than the table indicates. However, the study also finds that the lowest&#13;
1/ Ministry of Health data on public health centers imply roughly 60 million&#13;
visits a year in 1980. However, information was only available for 25% of the&#13;
centers. Moreover, estimates based on numbers of visits reported by the&#13;
centers themselves are likely to be biased downwards since a correspondence is&#13;
expected between visits and fees sent to the kabupaten government.&#13;
2/ These are the highest class of hospitals in Indonesia; one is in Jakarta&#13;
and the other in Surabaya. See Survai Biaya Pasien Rawat di Rumah Sakit&#13;
Tipe A 1980.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 9 -&#13;
classes of hospital care (classes III and IV) are used more by the lower and&#13;
middle socioeconomic groups. Since these classes of hospital care are more&#13;
heavily subsidized, this fact would imply less inequality in the distribution&#13;
of subsidies. It is not clear what the net effect of these different forces&#13;
is on the distribution of subsidies.&#13;
Policy Options&#13;
In health, the policy options available to the government for&#13;
increasing resources are similar to those in education. The government has to&#13;
take responsibility for undertaking various activities with positive&#13;
externalities which otherwise may not be carried out by the private sector, in&#13;
particular preventive health care such as immunizations, pre-natal and post-&#13;
natal care, sanitation and nutrition, as well as providing service in the&#13;
emergency sections of hospitals which tend to be an unprofitable&#13;
undertaking. The private sector could then take a relatively greater role in&#13;
curative care. To the extent that the poor use the PUSKESMAS and the lower&#13;
classes of hospitals, it would be desirable to improve the quality of service&#13;
in these facilities. The private sector should be encouraged to step in where&#13;
it can.  There are in fact many requests for setting up private hospitals and&#13;
maternity clinics.&#13;
Greater private sector participation would reduce the pressure on the&#13;
government itself to expand; government expansion can then become more&#13;
selective, while available resources are freed to operate and maintain the&#13;
existing facilities and to improve the quality of service. It would be&#13;
desirable if physical facilities are properly maintained and all the inputs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
to increase this to 30% by the year 2000. 1/ There is a need for better&#13;
quality control in drug production by the private sector and also of educating&#13;
the public. The cost of packaging and advertising greatly increases the cost&#13;
of drugs but many patients are not satisfied unless the doctor prescribes&#13;
drugs with familiar brand names.&#13;
Most doctors in government hospitals also have private practice. In&#13;
a large number of instances they spend only a few hours a day working in the&#13;
hospital. Further study is required to determine whether government salaries&#13;
for them are too low and, if so, how this fact affects their supply. In any&#13;
case, greater incentives for working in remote areas are probably necessary.&#13;
Graduates from medical schools are required to work as either INPRES doctors&#13;
in INPRES public health centers, in which case they would get housing and&#13;
transportation facilities, as well as an honorarium given to heads of INPRES&#13;
public health centers, or non-INPRES doctors assigned to government hospitals&#13;
of types C and D, in which case they would not get housing and transportation&#13;
facilities or honoraria. While working for the government, they can work in&#13;
private practice after office hours. The length of government service is five&#13;
years in Java and three years in the Outer Islands. 2/ After satisfying this&#13;
requirement, the doctors are free to look for another assignment or to enter&#13;
specialization.&#13;
1/  Sistem Kesehatan Nasional, p. 34.&#13;
2/ For East Timor it is one year and for Irian Jaya it is two years. Since&#13;
government hospitals cannot always absorb all new graduates, some of them may&#13;
be assigned to a private hospital by the government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
Finally, it would be desirable to set up accounting systems which&#13;
would enable unit costs of different types or levels of services to be&#13;
calculated.  At present, fees in the PUSKESMAS and government hospitals are&#13;
set by the regional or central government.   Once collected, they are remitted&#13;
to the government. The facilities, however, are run out of a budget and the&#13;
job is considered done so long as all expenditures are accounted for according&#13;
to the rules and regulations. How much of the cost is covered by fees is not&#13;
a consideration. In contrast, private health centers and hospitals have to be&#13;
mindful of these issues. The purpose of calculating unit costs is not in&#13;
order to know how much to charge, but rather to be able to make decisions on&#13;
how much, if any, to subsidize a certain service and to see clearly which&#13;
activities are being taxed and which are being subsidized in order to be able&#13;
to see the impact of the fee structure on different population groups.&#13;
It would also be worthwhile to consider allowing greater local&#13;
autonomy, for example at the PUSKESMAS level, and permitting a certain&#13;
proportion of fees collected to be retained by the facilities for operating&#13;
purposes. This is already the practice for a number of PUSKESMAS in certain&#13;
localities where there are incidentally fewer complaints of insufficient drug&#13;
supplies since the PUSKESMAS can use retained fees to purchase additional&#13;
drugs for sale to the patients.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
IV. Conclusion&#13;
The less than ideal financial situation and anticipation of resource&#13;
shortfall underlie our search for new solutions.&#13;
In summary, one option considered is the encouragement of a greater&#13;
role of the private sector. This would seem to be feasible and desirable in&#13;
both the education and health sectors. A second option, not exclusive of the&#13;
first, is the increase in the recovery of costs of providing services. This&#13;
paper examines user charges with particular attention to its equity&#13;
implications. It concludes that the present distribution of government&#13;
subsidies in education and health is skewed towards the rich, especially in&#13;
urban areas, since the rich are more likely to use the higher levels of&#13;
service where the subsidies are greater. An overall increase in user fees&#13;
which incorporates a more progressive fee structure would have the effect of&#13;
reducing the fiscal burden while making for greater equity in the distribution&#13;
of benefits.&#13;
While the options considered in this paper vary in their degree of&#13;
administrative complexity and apparent palatability, they are guided&#13;
throughout by the government's objective of equity in the provision of social&#13;
services. In that spirit, efficacy alone should not be the sole criterion in&#13;
the final judgment of their relative merit.&#13;
Lastly, it remains to be said that an expeditious commencement of the&#13;
remedial process may go a long way towards lessening the risks of a disruptive&#13;
overhaul at a later date.&#13;

student grew annually at the same rate as GDP per capita, which was assumed to grow at 5.5% per year.    The rationale for&#13;
this expenditure increase was to reduce the turnover of teachers and specialists.&#13;

            Financing and equity in the social sectors
            in Indonesia : some policy options
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper examines the role of the
            private sector and the potential for recovering costs in the
            public sector in the provision of education and health
            services in Indonesia, with particular attention to their
            budgetary and equity implications.  The study concludes that
            the option of encouraging a greater role for the private
            sector is feasible and desirable in both the education and
            health sectors.  Using data from the 1978 National
            Socioeconomic Survey, government subsidies per student are
            estimated for the different educational levels.  These are
            applied to the estimated numbers of public students to
            obtain the shares of government subsidies going to different
            household groups. The concusion is that the present
            distribution of government subsidies in education is skewed
            toward the rich, especially in urban areas, because the rich
            are more likely to use the higher levels of service where
            the subsidies per student are greater.  A similar exercise
            is done for health.  An overall increase in user fees, which
            incorporates a more progressive fee structure, would have
            the effect of reducing the fiscal burden on the government
            while making for greater equity in the distribution of benefits.
