PUNJAB PRIVATE SECTOR GROUNDWATER DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
1. SECTORAL BACKGROUND&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
I . I          The groundwater use has been a major factor in the growth of agricultural production in&#13;
Pakistan over the past two decades. Groundwater tubewells not only supply additional water but have&#13;
provided flexibility to match canal water supplies with crop water requirements. Before 1960s the&#13;
development of the groundwater tubewells was limited to open dug wells operated by animal power&#13;
mostly outside the canal command areas. Large scale development of groundwater resources was first&#13;
attempted by the Government under Salinity Control and Reclamation Projects (SCARPs program) for&#13;
controlling waterlogging and salinity. Under the SCARP projects, about 13,500 publically owned and&#13;
operated tubewells were installed. In areas underlain by fresh groundwater (FGW), water from SCARP&#13;
tubewells (STWs) was used to supplement canal supplies.   SCARP tubewells had a significant&#13;
demonstrative effect in starting private tubewell development in fresh groundwater areas. As a result,&#13;
private tubewells (PTWs) grew rapidly and there are now more than 300,000 private tubewells in the&#13;
country. With rapidly growing private sector and declining performance of SCARP tubewells, there is&#13;
need for redefining the role of the Government in the groundwater development. Hence, redefinition of&#13;
this role in Punjab's groundwater development sector is the main objective of this project.&#13;
1.2            The project builds on the experiences of SCARP Transition, Irrigation Systems&#13;
Rehabilitation. On-Farm Water Management programs and Private Tubewell Development Projects. This&#13;
staff appraisal report is based on the preparation report' by the Government with assistance of UNDP2&#13;
and the findiiigs of Pre-Appraisal and Appraisal missions which visited Punjab during July, 1994 and&#13;
June, 1995. respectively.&#13;
B. Agricultural Sector&#13;
1.3            Although the share of agriculture in the economy has been slowly decreasing, it is still&#13;
the backbone of the economy, employing more than 50 percent of the labor force and earning (directly&#13;
or indirectly) 70 percent of export revenues3. Total cultivated area is 21 million hectares (ha), with&#13;
overall cropping intensity of 101 percent. About 55 percent of the cropped area is under food-grains,&#13;
the most important of which are wheat and rice. The main cash crops are cotton and sugarcane, grown&#13;
on 12.4 and 4 percent of land, respectively. Cotton and high quality rice (Basmati) are important export&#13;
crops, and Pakistan is one of the leading cotton exporters in the world. Other major crops include&#13;
fodder, fruit and vegetables.&#13;
Third SCARP Transition Project. Project Preparation Report, Associated Consulting Engineering (ACE), May 1994.&#13;
Preparation was funded under. Investment Project Preparation in Water Sector --Umbrella-1l (PAK1881016) project financed by the&#13;
Umted Nations Development Program (UNDP).&#13;
Agricultuial policy and strategies for growth are the subject of a recent Bank report, "Pakistan: A Strategy for Sustainable Agricultural&#13;
Growthi". Report No.13092 PAK, November 3, 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.4           Most of the poor live in rural areas. Agriculture has particularly strong interaction with&#13;
rural poverty. Flight from rural areas is a contributing factor to urban poverty. Although absolute&#13;
poverty in Pakistan declined from 40 percent of rural population in the early-1960s to 25 percent by the&#13;
mid 1980s, this reduction is much less than East Asian countries with similar agricultural growth rates.&#13;
Agriculture is the primary user of natural resources --land and water resources. The development in the&#13;
sector has a direct impact on the incidence and pattern of poverty, natural resource management and&#13;
environmental protection, andi therefore, on sustainable development.&#13;
1.5           The sector has generally performed well, growing by more than three percent per annum&#13;
over the last three decades. The sources of growth have changed over the years: during the 1960s,&#13;
growth was mostly the result of the rapid uptake of the improved seed, fertilizer and irrigation packages;&#13;
during the 1970s it was the intensification of water and fertilizer use; and in the 1980s it was&#13;
improvement in crop management and incentives. The Government of Pakistan (GOP) has recently&#13;
launched a major economic reform progranm with the objectives of adjustment and growth. Agriculture&#13;
would have to play an important role in this process. However. there is limited scope for expanding&#13;
cultivable land or irrigation supplies and future growth has to rely on more efficient use of limited&#13;
resources. There is a particular need to ensure efficiency and sustainability in the management of land&#13;
and water, which are the two most important natural resources.&#13;
Irrigation Sector&#13;
1.6           Pakistan's agriculture is almost wholly dependent on irrigation --irrigated land supplies&#13;
more than 90 percent of agricultural production. Agriculture in most areas is not possible without&#13;
irrigation because the climate in Pakistan is arid to semi-arid witlh low and variable rainfall. Annual&#13;
rainfall over much of area is not more than 150 mm per annum, and evaporation is very high, ranging&#13;
from 1,250 mm to 2,800 mm per annum. However, there are abundant surface water resources in the&#13;
Indus Basin, which covering 566,000 km2 (70 percent of the country), is the major source of Pakistan's&#13;
water. The Indus Basin Irrigation System commands about 14 million ha which accounts for the bulk&#13;
of the agriculturally productive land. Annual river inflows average about 180 billion m3 of which about&#13;
130 billion m3 are diverted to canals. The Indus Basin Irrigation System is composed of three major&#13;
reservoirs (Chasma, Mangla and Tarbela)4, 19 barrages, 12 link canals, 43 canal conmnands and over&#13;
107,000 watercourses. The length of the canals is about 58,000 km, with communal watercourses (W/C),&#13;
farm channels and field ditches running another 1.6 million km.&#13;
1.7           In the Indus systein, river water is diverted by barrages and weirs into main canals and&#13;
subsequently into branch canal, distributaries and minors. Open, free-flowing outlets (moghas) regulate&#13;
water flow from distributaries and minors to W/Cs. Watercourse command area (chak) is a complex&#13;
miniature irrigation system with an average length of channels of 16 km. Water distribution to the field&#13;
is governed by a weekly time rotation (warabandi) based on the size of the land holding.&#13;
1.8           The canal system is also a major source of recharge for the groundwater. In fresh areas,&#13;
groundwater is pumped by public and private tubewells to supplement canal supplies. About 11,000&#13;
publically owned and operated STWs currently pump approximately 9 billion m3 annually. Pumpage&#13;
from STWs, however, is declining. On the other hand, with rapidly growing number of private tubewells&#13;
(PTWs) pumpage from groundwater is over 60 billion mi. STWs pump water in the communal&#13;
watercourses and it is distributed through the warabandi system. PTWs are mostly located on the farms&#13;
and farmers have more flexibility in their operation. Water supply from public tubewells is relatively&#13;
less significant --less than 15 percent of total groundwater pumpage or equivalent of less than 7 percent&#13;
Total live storage capacity of three reservoirs is about 18 billion m'.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
of canal water diversions. However, public tubewells require about half of Government's irrigation&#13;
operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) expenditures.&#13;
1.9            Flat topography and lack of well-defined natural drainage in the Indus Plain create a&#13;
surface drainage problem. The problem has been compounded by the construction of roads, railways,&#13;
flood embankments and irrigation systems that obstruct natural flows. The irrigation systems were&#13;
developed without provision of drainage. Over the years, about 14,000 km of surface drains have been&#13;
constructed in Punjab and more recently in the tail reaches of Rohri and Nara canal commands in Sindh.&#13;
The surface and subsurface drainage systems are inadequate. Under SCARPs, attempts were made to&#13;
meet the subsurface drainage iieeds through deep tubewells. A limited area is provided with tile drainage.&#13;
1. 10          About 2.2 million ha of irrigated land is outside Indus canal commanded area (cca),&#13;
scattered in relatively small parcels with water coming from open wells, tubewells, lift pumps, karezes,&#13;
springs, and small diversions. Generally, water supply in these system  is uncertain and varies with&#13;
season and location. Farmers have a major role in the management of these systems and some of these&#13;
were developed by communities themselves. Normally, these system do not suffer from waterlogging&#13;
and salinity problems.&#13;
1.11           While the irrigation and drainage systems are central to Pakistan's economy, they are&#13;
facing severe problems.  Despite Government's substantial budgetary input, the system is facing a&#13;
shortage of resources and suffering from severe and worsening operational problems. In addition to water&#13;
scarcity, major problems facing the sector are: inefficient management of water systems (that is low&#13;
delivery efficiency, and inequitable distribution); waterlogging and salinity; over exploitation of&#13;
groundwater in fresh groundwater areas: inadequate O&amp;M; and insufficient cost recovery. The average&#13;
delivery efficiency is reported to be about 35 to 40 percent from the canal head to the root zone, but&#13;
actual is even worse. Most of the losses are in the watercourses. The loss of such a major part of&#13;
surface water not only reduces available water for crops but it also contributes to waterlogging and&#13;
salinity. Another serious problem is inequitable distribution. Excessive losses compared with the original&#13;
desigin also meanis that water does not reach the tail end of the system. Moreover, illegal pumping from&#13;
canals adds to the inequity of distribution. Poorly maintained watercourses have the highest incidence&#13;
of illegal diversions. Many of the above problems are worsened by an excessive Government role with&#13;
inadequate participation of the beneficiaries in the system management.&#13;
C. Groundwater Potential and Development&#13;
. 12           Most of the Indus Basin has been formed as a result of alluvium deposits derived by rivers&#13;
from the miountaini ranges in the north. These alluvial deposits consist principally of fine and medium-&#13;
grained sands and silts. although there are discontinuous lenses of silt and clay. Their depth ranges from&#13;
450( m in upper Punjab to about 60 m in lower Sindh, where it is layered with silty and heavy deltaic&#13;
sediment. There is a vast unconfined aquifer of around 6 million ha covering most of this area. The&#13;
water table is mostly high and has been rising due to lack of drainage. The hydrogeological conditions&#13;
are mostly favorable for pumping by tubewells. Groundwater quality is variable, ranging from fresh near&#13;
the major rivers to highly saline further away. In some areas, groundwater is saline even near the rivers&#13;
due to local salt deposits. In total, about 79 percent of the area in Punjab and 28 percent of the area in&#13;
Sindh has fresh groundwater5 which is suitable for irrigation. However, the residual sodium carbonate&#13;
(RSC) which results from use of groundwater is often high. Exclusive reliance on groundwater can lead&#13;
to a build-up of salts. resulting in binding of the soil structure, reduced water infiltration into the root&#13;
zone and falling yields. Ideally, groundwater should be mixed with canal water for irrigation use.&#13;
Total dissol ed salt less than 1 .200 ppm and electrical conductivity less than 2 mmhos.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
Public Tubewell Development&#13;
1.13          By the 1950s, large areas in the Indus basin became waterlogged and soil salinity&#13;
increased, adversely affecting the agricultural productivity. Government involvement in the groundwater&#13;
development began with efforts to control the "twin menaces" of waterlogging and salinity by providing&#13;
drainage. The Government embarked on a series of SCARPs in the late-1950s aimed at lowering the&#13;
groundwater table by providing "vertical drainage" through large capacity. deep tubewells (60-140 liters&#13;
per second capacities and depth of 40-120 meters). Because of better economic returns, priority was&#13;
given to locating SCARPs in the areas where groundwater quality was suitable for supplemental&#13;
irrigationi, making the drainage a by-product in effect.  Over the last three decades about 13,500 STWs&#13;
have been installed by the Government in 36 projects covering a gross area of about 3.7 million ha. Most&#13;
of the STWs were equipped with electrically powered motors and deep turbine pumps with a relatively&#13;
large capacity of about 3 cusecs (.085 cubic meters/second).  Almost 75 percent of all STWs were&#13;
installed in the Punjab --8,000 in fresh groundwater areas and 1.800 in saline groundwater areas. In&#13;
saline grounidwater areas the STWs pumped water into drains or, when this was not possible, into the&#13;
larger canals. In FGW areas, water from STWs was normally pumped into watercourses and used for&#13;
irrigation along with surface water sL, plies. Bank involvement in public tubewell development was&#13;
limitetd to ilstallation of STWs in saline areas of Punjab under SCARP VI project (Cr. 0754-PAK).&#13;
1.14   Performance and Sustainability of SCARP Tubewells.         STWs were generally successful&#13;
in meeting their objective of maintaining the groundwater tables at desirable levels and providing a&#13;
supplemilentary source of irrigation. Their performance, however, declined over time due to poor&#13;
management and inadequate availability of funds for O&amp;M. Presently, most of the STWs are very old,&#13;
equipment has worn out resulting in frequent breakdowns, and well capacities' are significantly below&#13;
their original designs. In Punjab, about half of STWs are below 50 percent of original capacity and only&#13;
15 percent have more than 80 percent. The utilization of STWs at present is considerably lower than it&#13;
was originally and water supplies have become unreliable due to the factors mentioned above and&#13;
prolonged blackouts due to power shortage and an unreliable public grid.&#13;
1.15          The O&amp;M  costs of STWs have increased mlainyfold due to rapidly increasing power&#13;
tariffs, wages and mainitenance and replacement requirements.  Presently, the Punjab Irrigation&#13;
Departmenit (PID) is responsible for all O&amp;M  costs of STWs. These cost include electricity charges,&#13;
repair and mainteniance, operation of special workshops for repairs, salary of a full-time operator and&#13;
higher managemiient, and other establishment costs. Funding for O&amp;M of these tubewells is provided to&#13;
PID by the Government of Punjab (GOPunjab) through non-development budgetary allocations.&#13;
Expenditures for O&amp;M of STWs in FGW areas of Punjab during fiscal year 1994-95 were almost equal&#13;
to O&amp;M expenditures on canals while actual requirement were even more. Budget allocations for O&amp;M&#13;
of STWs in 1995-96 exceed the allocations for canals. Annually they are more than Rs. 150,000/STW.&#13;
1.16          Water charges (abiania) are based on crop acreage and type of crop. In Punjab, farmers&#13;
receiving water from canals as well as from STWs are liable for paying double water charge (double&#13;
abianaia). (twice the amount of farmers receiving water from canals only). However, present water&#13;
charges only recover about 35 percent of provincial O&amp;M costs on the irrigation and drainage systems.&#13;
Since O&amp;M cost of STWs, per unit of water supplied, is much higher than canals, the provincial subsidy&#13;
for the O&amp;M of STWs is many times more than for canals. Despite these expenditures water delivery&#13;
service from STWs has deteriorated due to institutional deficiencies. These include lack of motivation&#13;
and accountability of agency staff, high levels of political interference and rent seeking, as well as&#13;
inadequate conicerin for the needs of users.&#13;
Specitic capacity ot the well detiined as discharge per unit leIngd Ul drawdown, e.g. cusecs per foot of drawdowit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.17           The void created due to institutional weaknesses is filled to some extent by informal&#13;
farmers' groups which have sprung up in STW areas. These groups look after daily operations, such as&#13;
switching on the pumps' and regular maintenance. They also carry out repairs using local mechanics,&#13;
electricians and other services from the local markets. Funds for these repairs are usually collected on&#13;
an ad hoc basis from the benefiting farmers. However, farmers find it difficult to carry out repairs&#13;
involving the main shaft of turbine pumps as it requires specialized equipment available from PID&#13;
workshops. Nevertheless, they do follow up and assist PID in expediting such repairs.&#13;
1.18           The operation of STWs in the public sector is unsustainable due to institutional&#13;
weaknesses as well as financial and economic reasons. The institutional weakness essentially arise from&#13;
centralized management and lack of transparency without any formal participation of beneficiaries. Due&#13;
to the overall resource scarcity Pakistan is facing presently, it is becoming increasingly difficult to&#13;
allocate adequate funds for operation of STWs, and replacement of old ones. The economic cost of&#13;
pumping water by elect:iuity operated STW  is much higher (Rs. 0.20 per cubic meter) than diesel&#13;
operated shallow tubewells (Rs. 0. 10 per cubic meter).&#13;
Private Tubewell Development&#13;
1.19           A virtuil explosion in the private tubewells development followed the introduction of&#13;
tubewell technology by the public sector. Currently there are over 300,000 PTWs installed for irrigation&#13;
purposes, of which 80 percent are in the Punjab supplying 40 percent of all irrigation water. PTWs are&#13;
predominantly small shallow wells which use locally manufactured engines and centrifugal pumps. Their&#13;
average capacity is one cusec (0.028 ml per second) with maximum  size of two cusecs.  More&#13;
importantly, as yields and input levels rose, so did the importance of timely and adequate water supplies.&#13;
By installing PTWs, farmers reduce their risks of crop failure and improve yields by smoothing out&#13;
natural and operational fluctuations ;n water supplies from the canal system. Even in the STWs areas&#13;
of Punjab there are more than 50,000 PTWs. While returns to tubewells are high, the utilization rates&#13;
are very low. PTWs are used by both headenders and tailenders, although the tailenders rely more on&#13;
groundwater. Most PTWs are owned by medium to large farmers with holdings of five hectares or more.&#13;
Presently, there is neither any mechanism for allocating groundwater rights nor for regulating its use.&#13;
Any land owner can install a tubewell and begin pumping groundwater and in some areas there has been&#13;
over-exploitation due to anarchic private tubewell development.&#13;
Community Tubewell Development&#13;
1.20           There are a very limited number of community tubewells (CTWs) in operation, many of&#13;
which date back to the early 1960s with roots in the cooperative movement. The CTWs are set up and&#13;
operated by informal farmers' organizations with day to day management entrusted to one person who&#13;
is paid an honorarium. Like STWs, CTWs pump water into watercourses and this is shared either on&#13;
the basis of fixed turns (varabandi), on demand, or a mixture of both. The basis for levying charges&#13;
also varies. Charges are levied either on the basis of irrigated land, hours supplied, or both.8 Within&#13;
the CTW  command, farmers also supplement supplies through PTWs. Recently, about 550 CTWs in&#13;
Punjab and 150 CTWs in Sindh have been installed under Second SCARP Transition Project (Cr. 2257-&#13;
PAK). Farmers' Organizations (FOs) have installed these CTWs, with project assistance, and accepted&#13;
Due to powe~r imterruptions as well as low voltage the tubewells trips off and often has to be turned on several time every day. This&#13;
is otten donie hs the farmer on whose land STW is located or whose house is nearest.&#13;
In one area CTW sk ater was charged at the rate of Rs. 5.0 per hour. However, in most months this was not enough to cover all&#13;
expenditures and additionial amounts were then collected through a levy on land holdings. Famiers paid up to Rs. 8.0 per acre in&#13;
soflic inioiithis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
full responsible for their O&amp;M. More than 1,000 registered FOs have expressed interest in replacing&#13;
STWs with CTWs and the number is increasing. Therefore, in view of promising start more STWs are&#13;
being assigned for privatization under this model.&#13;
Behavior of Groundwater Aquifers&#13;
1.21            In the Indus Basin as a whole, recharge to the groundwater aquifers and extractions' are&#13;
in balance."  However, in the fresh groundwater areas of Punjab pumpage exceeds recharge and as a&#13;
result the water table is falling. In contrast, in the saline areas the water table is rising. The same holds&#13;
true in SCARP areas. In all FGW SCARP water tables are falling." This situation has reduced the&#13;
need for drainage to lower groundwater table, and unlike the original objectives of providing drainage -&#13;
-a public good, the STWs are merely supplying irrigation water which is a private good. Therefore,&#13;
government involvement in the operation of STWs is no longer justifiable.&#13;
1.22    Regulation of Groundwater Use.            In the past rising and not falling groundwater tables were&#13;
the major problem.  Therefore, government encouraged the installation of tubewells through tax&#13;
incentives and subsidies. The situation now is reversing in most of FGW areas, therefore, for sustainable&#13;
use of groundwater resources the need for enforcement of suitable regulations is more pressing now.&#13;
Existing legislation'2 include provisions for the control over groundwater aquifers, however, these were&#13;
never implemented, mainly because regulation was seen unnecessary. The monitoring, and regulation&#13;
of groundwater exploitation is a government function. However, to enable government to regulate&#13;
groundwater use successfully, its institutional capacity has to be enhanced in groundwater monitoring,&#13;
refining regulation requirements, assessments of safe cxploitation levels and allocation of rights, staffing,&#13;
technical competence, and organizational arrangements for implementation of regulatory functions. While&#13;
the proposed National Drainage Program would strengthen national capacity for groundwater monitoring,&#13;
the project would address local monitoring for the implementation of regulations, assessment of&#13;
sustainable yields from aquifers as well as capacity for implementing regulations.&#13;
D. Bank Group Assistance Strategy&#13;
1.23            The overall objective of the Bank's assistance strategy in Pakistan is to help reduce&#13;
poverty.  To address this objective, the Bank's approach highlights two closely linked challenges:&#13;
improving the inadequate basic social services and reducing constraints to sustained growth. Expanding&#13;
access to and improving the quality of basic social services are essential to improve living standards in&#13;
Pakistan, which now has dismal social indicators. In addition to assisting the completion of fiscal&#13;
adjustment, the Bank's strategy is to support the growth objectives by focusing on structural reforms,&#13;
improving the enabling environment for the private sector, strengthening inadequate basic infrastructure,&#13;
Groundwater aquifers are recharged by rain, rivers, seepage from canals. watercourses and fields. Extractions include. evaporation&#13;
and pumpage by tubewells.&#13;

reducing constraints on agriculture productivity, and protecting Pakistan's natural resource base. In&#13;
focussing assistance on public policy, institutional development, critical public investments for private&#13;
sector led growth, and strengthening the basis for private investments, the Bank is assisting the&#13;
redefinition of the public and private sectors in Pakistan.&#13;
1.24           In agriculture, the focus of our policy dialogue is on reshaping the public and private&#13;
sector roles. The Bank supports maintaining a high rate of agricultural growth, with emphasis on further&#13;
improving the link between agricultural growth and poverty alleviation, and ensuring environmentally&#13;
sustainable agricultural development. The Bank's short- and medium-term assistance will focus on: (a)&#13;
redefining the roles of the public and private sectors in all aspects of agriculture with fundamental shifts&#13;
in the irrigation and drainage subsector towards more decentralized and participatory management&#13;
systems; (b) reducing distortions in input and output prices and trade regimes; (c) improving efficiency&#13;
of agricultural public expenditures; (d) strengthening natural resource management by emphasizing local&#13;
institutions: and (e) strengthening support services to increase productivity and diversify agriculture.&#13;
1.25           In irrigation and drainage, Bank is encouraging the Government to adopt a completely&#13;
new approach.'3 Consistent with the country assistance strategy, the goals of establishing an efficient,&#13;
self-sustaining irrigation and drainage system are to be achieved by promoting the use of market-&#13;
determined incentives for improving the supply and management of irrigation and drainage services, and&#13;
by giving the private sector a greater stake in the system. The irrigation service would be decentralized&#13;
and privatized by developing commercially oriented public utilities (PUs) on a canal command basis, and&#13;
suitable FOs. and by formalizing water rights and water markets. Autonomous provincial authorities&#13;
would be developed for water delivery to PUs and handling off-farm drainage and regulatory bodies for&#13;
regulating the PUs and groundwater resources.&#13;
1.26           The restructuring of irrigation services cannot be achieved immediately, and must be done&#13;
in steps for successful implementation. The transformation of surface systems would be implemented&#13;
through a series of canal command level pilot projects in which PUs and FOs will be formed. The total&#13;
transition may take from 15 to 20 years. These pilots are under preparation in all provinces and would&#13;
be supported through other projects or sector loans such as National Drainage and Irrigation Programs.&#13;
While implementation of the strategy in the surface systems is still evolving, considerable experience&#13;
already exists in the country in private tubewell development and divestment of public tubewells.&#13;
Building upon this experience, the proposed project would be a major step towards implementing the&#13;
irrigation and drainage strategy in groundwater sector while leading the way for reforms in the&#13;
management of the surface systems. It fits into the Bank Group's country assistance strategy as it would&#13;
provide assistance in: (a) redefining the role of government in the groundwater development; (b) assigning&#13;
groundwater rights and developing regulatory framework for ensuring sustainable use of groundwater&#13;
resources; (c) improving water use efficiency; (d) rationalizing public expenditures for O&amp;M of the&#13;
irrigation and drainage systems, and strengthening the principles of capital cost recovery in the sector;&#13;
(e) enhancing community participation, thereby, building a solid base for ultimately transferring all&#13;
irrigation systems to the beneficiaries; and (f) protecting the environment by controlling saline water&#13;
intrusion into fresh aquifers.&#13;
E. Government Policy&#13;
1.27           Since the 1980s, Pakistan has developed a comprehensive policy reform framework to&#13;
address its development challenges. The strategy concentrates on three broad development goals:&#13;
Pakistait-Irrigation and Drainage: Issues and Options, Report No. 11884-PAK. March 25, 1994.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
accelerating efforts to tackle poverty and human resources development issues; strengthening enabling&#13;
environment for the private sector; and improving management of Pakistan's natural resources and the&#13;
environment. 4&#13;
1.28            The Government agrees with  the  Bank's assistance  strategy  in agriculture, and&#13;
irrigation/drainage sectors for achieving development goals. Government strategy in irrigation and&#13;
drainage sectors reflected in the Eighth Five Year Plan (1993-98)'5 is fully in line with Bank's assistance&#13;
strategy. The Government has started the institutional reforms by initiating the formation of Area Water&#13;
Boards at the canal command level and Provincial Irrigation and Drainage Authorities at the provincial&#13;
levels.  For implementation of the strategy the government has started preparation of several pilot&#13;
projects. In the groundwater sector, a major shift in the Goverrnent's policy towards greater private&#13;
sector role dates back to the Revised Action Programme for Irrigated Agriculture (RAP, 1979).16  The&#13;
Government endorsed the RAP recommendations for transferring the groundwater development&#13;
responsibility, as well as STWs to the private sector in 1980, and adopted it as a part of revised National&#13;
Agricultural Policy. This policy has been reiterated in the Sixth (1983-88) as well as in the Seventh&#13;
(1988-93) Five Year Plans. The government is implementing these policies by instituting a moratorium&#13;
on the installation and replacement of public tubewells in the fresh groundwater areas and by supporting&#13;
projects aimed at divestment of public tubewells.   The Government is strongly  committed to&#13;
privatization  of groundwater development.   During  the current Five Year Plan  (Eighth) the&#13;
Government plans to support transfer of 8,000 STWs to the private sector. Subsequent to a pilot project&#13;
in Punjab under which 213 STWs water divested, the Government is privatizing 1,346 STWs in Punjab&#13;
and 380 STWs in Sindh under the Second Scarp Transition Project.&#13;
F. Bank Group Support and Lessons Learned&#13;
Bank Group Support&#13;
1.29            Pakistan's agricultural development efforts have attracted substantial support from  the&#13;
Bank Group. To date, about 60 agricultural (and Environment) projects in Pakistan have received&#13;
US$2.3 billion equivalent of IBRD/IDA financing (68 percent IDA'7 and 32 percent IBRD), the majority&#13;
of which has been for irrigation. Projects have also included: agricultural support services (credit,&#13;
research and extension); commercial agriculture (seeds and agro-industry), forestry, watershed,&#13;
environment protection and resource conservation; livestock development; and flood damage restoration.&#13;
Bank's involvement in the water sector dates back to the successful settlement of the apportionment of&#13;
the Indus water between Pakistan and India. Until mid-1970s, the Bank assisted with the construction&#13;
of large dams and link canals to develop additional water supplies. The Bank also assisted GOP with its&#13;
program for controlling waterlogging and salinity. In the 1980s, increasing attention was devoted to&#13;
irrigation systems rehabilitation, on-farm water management, and private tubewell development along with&#13;
controlling the problems of waterlogging and salinity, and providing an outlet to the sea through the Left&#13;
Bank Outfall Drain for disposing Indus basin's drainage effluent. In addition to providing financial&#13;
'    The Go vernmient's reform program is detailed in several major policy/operational docunients: the Fourth Policy Framework&#13;
Paper. ihe Letter of Development Policy for PSAL, the Letter of Intent for ESAF. the Social Action Program, the National&#13;
Conservation Strategy, and five year plans, particularly eighth five year plan.&#13;

assistance, the Bank has traditionally played a critical role in the water sector policies, investment&#13;
planning and donor coordination. Major sectoral planning studies have been carried out with Bank&#13;
assistance, such as Indus Special Study (1967)'8, RAP (1979), Water Sector Investment Planning Study&#13;
(1990), Drainage Sector Environrnental Assessment (1993). Bank's recent Agriculture, and Irrigation&#13;
and Drainage sector strategies are leading the sectors in new directions and its financial assistance, as well&#13;
as policy advice, have contributed to attaining self-sufficiency and export generation in the past decade.&#13;
Lessons Learned&#13;
1.30   There can be no doubt that the provision of irrigation and drainage facilities have had a major&#13;
positive impact on agricultural production in Pakistan. It is also evident that farmers generally respond&#13;
well when provided with reliable and timely irrigation service.  Nevertheless, there is room  for&#13;
considerable improvement in all aspects of planning, design, implementation and O&amp;M of irrigation&#13;
systems. The Bank-supported projects have suffered implementation delays due to slow GOP approval&#13;
process, delays in recruitment of consultants, inadequate procurement procedures and inadequately&#13;
capitalized contractors, unresponsive managemuent, and problems in inter-agency coordination. In order&#13;
to avoid delays due to GOP approvals, the preparation of PC-I`9 was started immediately following the&#13;
project appraisal and it has been approved by the Provincial Development Working Party (PDWP).&#13;
Similarly, recruitment of project implementation consultants has been completed before Board&#13;
presentation. Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (BSBDs) would be used to reduce delays due to&#13;
procurement procedures, improve transparency and attract well-capitalized reputable contractors. For&#13;
smooth implementation as well as to allow flexibility, the project would be implemented through a&#13;
separate Project Management Unit (PMU), with a minimal staff but supported by management and social&#13;
consultants.&#13;
1.31    Beneficiary Participation.    In the past, government planned, implemented and operated the&#13;
irrigation and drainage system without much consultation with the beneficiaries. Farmers started to play&#13;
a significant role under IDA assisted On-Farm Water Management Prograrn (OFWM). Under OFWM,&#13;
formal Water Users' Associations were formed and registered to contribute to the lining of watercourses.&#13;
In Punjab, WUAs' provide skilled (masons) and urskilled labor, 30 percent of the material cost in six&#13;
installments over three years, and provide assistance in supervising the implementation. The WUAs play&#13;
a critical role in improving watercourses. However, many become inactive after completion of civil&#13;
works. The main reason for their inactivity is that Government keeps control of irrigation water as well&#13;
as revenue collection, water supply increases slightly while O&amp;M requirements reduce. As a result,&#13;
WUAs do not have any function essential for operation of irrigation systems. Several measures are taken&#13;
in the proposed project towards developing sustainable FOs. FOs will be involved in planning,&#13;
implementation and O&amp;M of irrigation facilities, especially the CTWs. FOs will control water supply&#13;
from the tubewells and have a continuous function --supplying water to its members, collecting revenue&#13;
and carrying out O&amp;M without interference from any Government agency. They will remain active in&#13;
such an environment. The FOs would decide about the tubewell type (taking over STWs as such, with&#13;
modification or installing new ones, electric or diesel), machinery, size, and location of the CTWs. Other&#13;
civil works will be constructed after the successful functioning of FOs for at least one year. FOs will&#13;
collect funds, operate bank accounts, and plan and participate in the construction and improvement of&#13;
surface systems. Contrary to the OFWM in which WUAs were organized by the Government agencies,&#13;
The main purpose of die investigations resulting in the report "Water and Power Resources of West Pakistan. a Study in Sector&#13;
Planning", which became known as the Indus Special Study (1967) or Action Plan, was to develop a program of optimum&#13;
exploitation of water resources that would be available to Pakistan after implementation of the Indus Waters Treaty of 196(1.&#13;
PC-I stands for Planning Commission Proforma 1. It is GOP's project appraisal documents and its approval is a condition for&#13;
including project funding in the development program and disbursements to the implementing agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
specially trained Social Organizers working through local NGOs and village activists, will be responsible&#13;
for organizing FOs. The project will also support the training of FOs in the O&amp;M of facilities, record&#13;
keeping of expenditure and water charges, operation of bank accounts, and water deliveries to individual&#13;
users. Moreover, the full recovery of capital costs with significant recovery up front will also lead to&#13;
sustainable participatory initiatives.&#13;
1.32   SCARP Transition Projects. The outcome of SCARP Transition Pilot Project (Cr. 1693-PAK)&#13;
and available information on Second SCARP Transition Project (CR. 2257-PAK)20 show that the&#13;
objectives of privatizing the groundwater pumpage while controlling the water tables at the desired level&#13;
have been met. Experiences of these transition projects are fully incorporated into the project design.&#13;
These include: limiting assistance for CTWs only; allowing flexibility to FOs in selecting type, size and&#13;
location of CTWs; emphasis on1 transfer of STWs as such to FOs; involvement of social mobilizers and&#13;
local NGOs; implementation by an autonomous PMU; training and a redeployment package for surplus&#13;
SCARPs O&amp;M staff; linkage with watercourse renovations; and emphasis on monitoring and evaluation&#13;
(M&amp;E). Encouraging PTWs to replace STWs results in anarchy, building excessive capacity leading to&#13;
over-capitalization and excessive O&amp;M costs; danger of over-exploitation of groundwater, inequity in&#13;
water supply, as well as improper conjunctive use of canal and groundwater. Replacing STWs with&#13;
CTWs (instead of PTWs) would overcome these shortcomings2". The slow implementation of transition&#13;
projects is mainly due to conflicting interests of the implementing agency (PID) which has sole&#13;
responsibility for O&amp;M of STWs. With transition of STWs the agency looses significant budgetary&#13;
resources and is left with staff redundancies, especially the STW operators. The disgruntled STW&#13;
operators, who mostly reside in the same village served by STW create project implementation problems&#13;
and a constant source of negative publicity for the project. These problems will be minimized by placing&#13;
PMU outside PID and introducing a package for redeployment of STWs staff (including retraining and&#13;
a severance package). M&amp;E capacity at federal and provincial levels, which is generally weak, will be&#13;
enhanced under the proposed National Drainage Program. However, the project will also support M&amp;E&#13;
specifically for groundwater regulations and performance of FOs. For ensuring a timely start, M&amp;E&#13;
consultants will be recruited along with management consultants.&#13;
G. Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
1.33          Privatization of groundwater development is an important element of Government policy&#13;
which IDA supports.  However, its implementation is not easy due to problems associated with&#13;
elimination of STW's O&amp;M subsidies and reduction in agency staff. IDA has been instrumental in&#13;
shifting the emphasis from groundwater development by the public sector to the private sector, based on&#13;
close farmers' involvement. No other donor has similar experience in Pakistan. IDA support is essential&#13;
for developing sustainable FOs for operation of community tubewells which are unlikely to emerge&#13;
spontaneously. Participatory management of groundwater would provide an excellent base for launching&#13;
participatory irrigation management program at the secondary level of the canal systems&#13;
(distributaries/minors). The project would also help institutionalize FOs and move towards decentralizing&#13;
the provincial irrigation agencies at canal command level public utilities. IDA's role is crucial in&#13;
achieving project objectives of reforming the institutional structure and implementing elements of the&#13;
irrigation and drainage strategy which was developed and agreed with the Government as result of&#13;
'   About 213 STWs were divested under SCARP Transition Pilot Project in Punjab. Approximately 1,346 in Punjab and 380 STWs&#13;
in Sindh will be divested under the Second SCARP Transition Project.&#13;
Based on the finding of the preparation report of the proposed project, the Second SCARP Transition Project was restructured&#13;
and about 230 STWs in Punjab were earmarked for replacement with CTWs only on experimental basis during mid-term review.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
extensive sector work done over the last three years.22 IDA's involvement is necessary for redefining&#13;
the role of Government in the development of groundwater, development of a regulatory framework,&#13;
avoiding environmental hazards of saline water intrusion, and rationalizing public funds for O&amp;M of the&#13;
irrigation and drainage systems and improving cost recovery from beneficiaries. The project would&#13;
support IDA's poverty relief objectives through its impact on growth of income of small farmers. In&#13;
addition, the project would support IDA's environrnental, public-sector management, and private-sector&#13;
development objectives.&#13;
THE PROJECT AREA&#13;
A. Physical Features&#13;
Location&#13;
2.1             The project area lies in the central and southern parts of Punjab Province and falls within&#13;
Gujranwala, Sargodha, Faisalabad, Multan and Lahore administrative Divisions (see Maps IBRD 27738&#13;
and 27739).23 It consists of fresh groundwater areas of SCARP II (including Shahpur), SCARP III&#13;
(Rangpur Unit), SCARP IV and SCARP V (Shorkot Kamalia). It also includes saline groundwater&#13;
(SGWs) area of SCARP 11 and saline areas within24 or at the boundaries of FGW areas, where they pose&#13;
risks of contaminating the fresh groundwater aquifer. The gross area is about 1.450 million ha, of which&#13;
1.188 million ha have FGW, while the canal commanded area (cca) is about 1.295 million ha of which&#13;
about 1.071 millions ha have FGW.  SCARPs in Punjab are generally between the major rivers (doabs)&#13;
and have flat topography (Annex I Table 1). Location, gross area, and cca of the SCARPs included in&#13;
the project are given in Annex I Table 2.&#13;
Climate and Soils&#13;
2.2             The Punjab (and the project areas) have a continental sub-tropical climate, ranging from&#13;
sub-humid in the north-east to arid in the south-west, with hot summers and mild winters. The average&#13;
monthly maximum temperatures range from 20°C in the winter to over 420C in the summer, with May&#13;
and June being the hottest months prior to monsoon rains. The minimum temperatures fall below 5°C&#13;
in the winter, with December and January being the coolest months. The area lies on the fringe of the&#13;
monsoon belt, with more than 70 percent of the rain falling during the monsoon period from June to&#13;
September. Average annual rainfall ranges from about 650 mm (Lahore) to 190 nmm (Bahawalnagar),&#13;
generally decreasing from the north-east to the south-west(Annex 1, Table 3). Conversely, the annual&#13;
reference evapotranspiration (ET() ranges from about 1,650 mm in Lahore to 1,880 mm in Bahawalnagar.&#13;
2.3             The soils have been formed from alluvium derived from the mountain ranges to the north&#13;
and deposited by the present and ancestral rivers of the Indus basin. The alluvium deposits consist&#13;
2-  Irrigation and agriculture strategies are outlined in recent Bank report. "Pakistan-Irrigation and Drainage: Issues an Options", Report&#13;
No. I 1884-PAK, March 25 and "Pakistan: A Strategy for Sustainable Agricultural Growth", Report No. 13092 PAK, November 3,&#13;
1994. Dissemination of the strategies was done through a series of national and international seminars and workshops organized by&#13;
the Bank, Government, and farming communities.&#13;
23   These Divisions include Gujrat, Sargodha. lhang, Muzaffargarh, Mandi Bahauddin, Sialkot. Gujranwala, Sheikupura, and Toba Tek&#13;
Singh districts&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
principally of fine and medium-grained sand and silt, although there are discontinuous lenses of silt and&#13;
clay. As a result, the alluvial deposits, which are from 12 to 500 meters thick, form a unified and highly&#13;
transmissive aquifer. The soils are relatively fertile, suitable for growing a wide range of crops with&#13;
good yields, particularly if sufficient nitrogen and phosphate inputs are provided. About 74 percent of&#13;
the soils are of medium to moderately coarse texture, have good internal drainage and are well-suited to&#13;
irrigated agriculture. About 13 percent are coarse-textured, with low water-holding capacity, requiring&#13;
good on-farm water management and frequent irrigations. The remaining 13 percent are moderately fine-&#13;
textured, with poor internal drainage characteristics. The implementation of the SCARP program has&#13;
reduced soil salinity/sodicity problems in most fresh groundwater areas. However, the situation is&#13;
worsening in some SGW areas. From periodic soil profile tests conducted by WAPDA, the proportion&#13;
of non-saline, non-sodic soil profiles varies from as low as 40 percent in SCARP V (Shorkot-Kamalia)&#13;
to 88 percent in Shahpur. (Annex 1, Table 4).&#13;
Water Resources&#13;
2.4    Surface Water Supplies.      The Indus River and its four major tributaries (Jhelum, Chenab,&#13;
Ravi and Sutlej) flow through the Punjab. Water from these rivers is diverted by a series of barrages into&#13;
9 large canal systems serving the project area. River flows are highly seasonal with almost 60 percent&#13;
of the total annual flow occurring between June and August. Yearly variations in surface water&#13;
diversions to the canals are reducing over time, mainly due to increasing control over the river system&#13;
by reservoirs, inter-river link canals and barrages. In the fresh groundwater areas of the project, the&#13;
average canal water supply at the watercourse head from 1988-1992 was 3.51 million acre feet (4,325&#13;
million m3) and accounted for 41 percent of total irrigation supplies. In saline groundwater areas, the&#13;
surface water supply averaged 0.86 million acre feet (1,063 million m3), equivalent to 69 Percent of total&#13;
irrigation supplies. Surface water supplies are also the main source of recharge to the groundwater which&#13;
is then reused by pumping through tubewells.&#13;
2.5    Groundwater Supplies.        A total of 5,054 STWs were installed in the project area, of which&#13;
4,233 were in the fresh groundwater areas and the remaining 821 in the saline areas. In FGW areas&#13;
about 90 percent of fresh groundwater STWs (3,860) are currently operational but only 15 percent are&#13;
in good condition, capable of pumping 80 percent or more of their original capacity (Annex 1, Table 9).&#13;
The present capacity of the STWs is estimated at 9,597 cusecs (272 m3 per second) supplying about 2.32&#13;
million acre feet (2,867 million m3) of irrigation water at the watercourse heads. Pumping groundwater&#13;
at the head of the watercourse improves overall distribution as well as application efficiency, including&#13;
that of canal water. In most watercourses the canal water does not reach towards the tail when the STW&#13;
is not operating. Therefore, tail farmers lose their share of canal water and they are left with the option&#13;
of using PTW water only. The use of groundwater without canal water leads to damaging of the soils.&#13;
In saline areas of SCARP II, about 426 have marginal quality water useable only after mixing with the&#13;
canal water. These tubewells pump water into the watercourses while the remaining tubewells having&#13;
water supply unsafe for irrigation use, discharge water into canals (119 STWs ) and drains. Total&#13;
pumpage in the saline area of SCARP II is estimated at 0.25 million acre-feet (308 million m3).&#13;
2.6           In addition, low capacity (typically 0.75 to 1 cusec) PTWs have been installed where fresh&#13;
or marginal groundwater can be obtained from shallow aquifer, usually to a depth of 30 meters. There&#13;
are about 44,000 PTWs in the fresh groundwater project areas pumping 3.01 million acre-feet (3,710&#13;
million m3). Their utilization rate of PTWs is extremely low compared with STWs --below 10 percent.&#13;
In addition, there are 1,780 PTWs in the saline zones of SCARPs II that have pockets of marginally fresh&#13;
groundwater. These PTWs pump about 0.13 million acre-feet (162 million m3). The supply of irrigation&#13;
water from different sources is given in Annex 1, Table 8 and summarized in Table 2.1 below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
2.7    Groundwater Levels and Trends.    Present average depths to water tables vary between&#13;
different SCARP areas. They range from 2.4 meters in Shahpur to 4.3 meters in SCARP IV in the pre-&#13;
monsoon period. After the monsoon they range from as high as 1.5 meters in Shahpur to as low as 4.2&#13;
meters in SCARP V (Shorkot-Kamalia). The trends of groundwater levels also vary among SCARP&#13;
areas. There have been increased waterlogging problems (water table between 0 and 1.5 m) in parts of&#13;
Shahpur, indicating a need for additional pumping. Conversely, water tables are falling slightly in&#13;
SCARPs 11, and are stable in SCARPs IV, and V (Shorkot-Kamalia) (Annex 1, Table 10). In saline&#13;
groundwater areas, groundwater levels are high, resulting in high evaporation and movements of salts&#13;
to the soils.&#13;

2.8    Groundwater Quality.           Most of the STWs in the fresh groundwater areas (91 percent)&#13;
produce water of safe or marginal quality, with about 9 percent producing hazardous quality water.&#13;
Although the overall salinity of most of the pumped groundwater is low, the residual sodium carbonate&#13;
(RSC) is often high, which can result in binding of the soil structure and reduced water infiltration into&#13;
the root zone. However, as most of the STW water is pumped into watercourses and mixed with surface&#13;
water supplies, the build-up of RSC is reduced. WAPDA's SCARP Monitoring Organization's records&#13;
show that there has been little overall change in water quality over the last 10 years but there has been&#13;
a decrease in the number of safe wells at the boundaries between the fresh and saline zones in SCARP&#13;
11. primarily due to movement of groundwater from  saline aquifer towards the fresh areas. Shallow&#13;
groundwater has not been monitored systematically, but its quality is usually better because surface&#13;
irrigation system is the main sources of recharge. However, in some areas PTWs water is higher in RSC&#13;
compared with STWs (Annex 1, Tables 11 and 12). Often PTW water is pumped into the field channels&#13;
without mixing with the surface water, therefore, negative effects of RSC build up rapidly.&#13;
B. Relevant Water Sector Institutions and Legislation&#13;
Water Sector Institutions&#13;
2.9            There are several institutions directly or indirectly involved in the water sector. At the&#13;
federal level the Water and Power Development Authority (WAPDA) as an executive arn of Ministry of&#13;
Water and Power is entrusted with the responsibility for: development of water resources and supply of&#13;
irrigaiioni water; prevention and reclamation of waterlogged and saline lands and drainage; flood control;&#13;
generatioln, transmission and distribution of power; and land navigation. In respect of the water sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
projects, WAPDA acts as an agency of the Governmeit for implementation of the schemes, which upon&#13;
completion are transferred to Provincial Irrigation Departmenits. WAPDA is also responsible for O&amp;M&#13;
of multi-purpose reservoirs and some inter-river Iink canals. O&amp;M of the irrigation and drainage systems,&#13;
including public tubewells, and flood control is responsibility of the PID.  Farmers maintain the&#13;
watercourses and farn chaninels. Water charges are assessed by the PID. However, they are collected&#13;
by the Provincial Revenue Department. The PID retains institutional control over public sources of water&#13;
and public drainage facilities. The role of Punjab Agriculture Department (PAD, Directorate General On-&#13;
Farn  Water Management) in water delivery and disposal is Iimited to registering the Water Users&#13;
Association, techiical support and improvement of watercourses and on-farm drainage. The Agriculture&#13;
Department in the past also offered assistance in the installationi of PTWs by renting drilling machinery.&#13;
Provincial subsidies for installationi of PTWs were also routed through PAD. However, due to financial&#13;
constrainits, these are now disbursed only In PID implemented SCARP transition areas.&#13;
2.10           The Planninig and Developmenit (P&amp;D) Board, Federal Ministry of Planliling, and Planiling&#13;
Commission prepare five-year and aninual developmenit plans with support from sectoral agencies. They&#13;
are also responsible for project planniniig, appraisal and approval for inclusionl in the development plans.&#13;
Existing Legislation and Regulations&#13;
2.1 1          The Pun jab Canal and Drainage Act of 1 873 with subsequent amendmnents25 provides the&#13;
maini legislative basis for irrigation and drainage services. Althoughi water is a nationial resource, the Act&#13;
entitles the Provincial Government to use and control all water, rivers, streams, lakes, and subsoil water&#13;
for irrigation drainage and navigationial purposes. Even thouigil the meaning of "canal" includes tubewells,&#13;
the law  says very little about the use or control of ulidergrounid waters.  The Water and Power&#13;
Development Authority Act, 1958 extends WAPDA's control over undergrotiuid water in any region in&#13;
a province. The control is, however, in the context of controllinig waterlogging and salinity, one of the&#13;
main objectives of creating WAPDA. The Punjab Soil Reclamation Act, 1952 is most explicit about the&#13;
control of groundwater even though its objective was also to accelerate reclamation and improvemenit of&#13;
waterlogged and saline lands.  The Act gives control of all groulidwater uses except domestic and&#13;
livestock to the Pun jab Soil Reclamationi Board (clause 26).26  It provides the basis for licensing the&#13;
installationi of tubewells and authorizes the Board to close down tubewells, either temporarily or&#13;
permanently, if they negatively effect the existing use of water. Under the Act, the Board issued elaborate&#13;
rules (West Pakistan Land Water Development Board, Control over Undergrounid Waters, Rules, 1965)&#13;
for licensing the tubewell, inspection of licenses and penalties for using tubewells without a license. The&#13;
institutional structure of SCARPs and staffing was done exercising the powers under this Act. The Board&#13;
weint throughi several organizationlal structures, and in 1973, with the transfer of SCARPs to provinces,&#13;
PID  was appointed as its administrator for executing O&amp;M  of the project, while, planning and&#13;
development fuLictionis were transferr-ed to the Punjab Planniniig and Development Board.&#13;
2.12           In the past. efforts of the Board and other agencies were focused prinarily on lowering&#13;
the water tables, and tubewells were generally encouraged for drainage as well as ir-igationi purposes.&#13;
There is no evidence of restricting tubewell developmenits throughi licensing in any area In the past.&#13;
Hlowever, the legislative basis exists for regulating groundwater use. Its implemenitation would be possible&#13;
only after defininig regulatling procedLires. creating an institutionial set-up and developing implementation&#13;
arrangemenlts.&#13;

Farm Size and Tenure.&#13;
2.13           The average farm size witlhin the project area ranges from about 3.8 ha in Lalhore Division&#13;
to 5. i ha in Sargodlha Division, withi an overall average of 4.4 ia. The farm  size distribution indicates&#13;
that about 69 percent of farms are less thani 5 hia, wiliie only 8 percent are larger than 10 ha (Annex 1,&#13;
Table 13). Overall, about 80 percent of farms (less thani 6 ha in size) have hialf ot the land, wiliie 20&#13;
percent farms (thiose greater thlan 6 lha) has the other half. Land lholdings are usually fragmented, witlh&#13;
each farimier cultivating an average of three plots located in different places. The average houselhold size&#13;
is about 7 persons.&#13;
2.14           About 77 percent of the farmiers cultivate their owIn land, and about 30 percent of these&#13;
farmers also rent some land. About 23 percent of farmers are pure tenants, usually renting from  larger&#13;
farmers or landlords on a shiare-cropping or cashi-rentinig basis.&#13;
Agricultural Production&#13;
2. 15   Cropping Patterns and Intensities.   There are three major cropping patterns in the pro'ject area.&#13;
The cottonl-whieat system  is prevalenit in southern SCARPs Ill Rangpur Unit; the rice-whieat system  in&#13;
SCARP IV and the northierin part of SCARP IL. and the sugarcane-wheat system in SCARPs V and most&#13;
of SCARP 11 and Slialipur. In the rtibi (winlter) season, whieat is the most important crop in each system,&#13;
typically taking up more than 50 percent of cca. Othier important wlinter crops include fodder (berseem)&#13;
and small areas of pulses. In the kharif(summer) season, cottoIn is grown on 35 percent of cca in cotton-&#13;
wheat system; paddy takes more than 50 percent of cca in rice-wheat system (about 80 percent in Basmati&#13;
and 20 percent in hiigih-yielding IRRI varieties); and sugarcane over 15 percent in sugarcane-wheat area.&#13;
Othier importanit crops grown in the khurif season include fodder (maize and sorghum), other grains&#13;
(maize, sorghlum  and millet), and some pulses and oilseeds. Orchards hlave been increasing in recent&#13;
years, the most importanit being citrus, guava and mango, with cropped areas ranging from 3 to 1 3 percent&#13;
of cca. Overall croppling intenisities hiave been rising and currently range from  120 to 145 percent in&#13;
different SCARPs. (Aniex 1, Table 14).&#13;
2.16   Crop Yields.  Wheat yields range from about 1.6 to 2.0 toins per ha, and have been increasing&#13;
at a rate of over 2 percent a year since 1980. Average maize yields range from 1 .3 to 1 .5 tons per h1a,&#13;
withi yields increasinlg by about I percent a year. Paddy yields range from about 1 .1 to 1 .5 tons per ha&#13;
and, ulilike othier grain crops, have remained more or less static in recent years. In the sugarcane-wheat&#13;
areas, average sugarcane yields are about 40 tons per ha. Cotton yields have averaged 1 .3 to 1 .8 tons per&#13;
ha in the cotton-wheat areas. Cotton yields have doubled since 1980. However, they are declining over&#13;
tihe last three years due to wide-spread viruses. Fodder yields are rarely recorded, but estimated average&#13;
berseenii yields are in the order of 25-30 toils per ha (fresh weight), about double the yield of kharif fodder&#13;
crops sucih as maize, sorghum and millet. (Aniex 1, Table 14)&#13;
2. 7   Water Input. Water supply is one of the major constrailits to agriculture production in the&#13;
project area. The crop water requirements are much higher than the effective rainfall (Annex I Table 15).&#13;
On an afilual basis, water supplies from  canals and groundwater meet only 90 percent of irrigation&#13;
rcqui4remnents (Anniex 1. Table 16).  lowever, water shortages are very acute in peak demand periods.&#13;
vlMarchl/April and( Scptemberi/October.&#13;
2. 1 8   Agricultural Inputs and Services.    Inputs, including fertilizer and pesticides, are mostly&#13;
provided throughi the private sector, with numerous small dealers supplying these items in the market&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
towns. HIowever, fertilizer imports are normally routed througlh the Punjab Agricultural Development and&#13;
Supply Corporation to a network of dealers. In the past, Government policy was to subsidize fertilizers,&#13;
pesticides and inputs; however, input supply has now been essentially privatized and subsidies eliminated,&#13;
particularly on nitiogenious fertilizers and pesticides. Fertilizer use is genierally low. Pesticide use is&#13;
signilficanit, mainilv because 60 to 80 percenlt of the cottoni crop is sprayed.&#13;
2.19           Use of improved seed has been held back by problems of availability, accessibility, and&#13;
quality. Most farimers keep their owi seed or buy inferior quality seed from  local dealers. The Punjab&#13;
Seed Corporation is the main source of improved seed for cotton, wheat and rice. Some private suppliers&#13;
have also recently started marketing seeds for cotton, maize and some minor crops. Seed produced by&#13;
the Seed Corporation is procured by the Agricultural Development and Supply Corporation and supplied&#13;
to the farmers through their dealers.&#13;
2.20           Agricultural extension services in the project areas have been strengthened under the&#13;
Agricultural Fxteisioni and Adaptive Researcih Project. Phase 11 (AEAR-11, Cr. 1 762-PAK), whichi&#13;
introduced thc traininig and visit system all over Punjab in 1987. At the district level, a Deputy Director&#13;
Agriculture is in chiarge of extensioni services, and is supported by an Assistant Director of Agriculture&#13;
at the fehsil level and Field Assistants, averaging about one per 1,100 farm household.&#13;
Marketing&#13;
2.2 1          In Pakistan, both Government and the private sector are engaged in procurement and&#13;
marketing of farn output. Government procurement through designated agencies covers all major crops&#13;
suchi as wheat, cotton, rice, gram, potatoes, onions, oilseeds and sugarcane at a guaranteed minimum price&#13;
or support price. Support prices for these products are fixed through a consultative process taking into&#13;
accounlt the cost of production, domestic demanid, supply and stock position, domestic and interinationial&#13;
prices, possible impact on the cost of living, and intersectoral considerationis. The support prices program&#13;
is designed to combat price falls ihmediately following harvest, which could force farmers with limited&#13;
storage to sell at depressed prices. The procurement agencies must purchase all quantities offered to them&#13;
if the iiarket price falls below the support price. Fundinig these purchases is often problematic.  The&#13;
program.i, throughi risk transfer, provides incentives to farmers at substantial cost to Government, which&#13;
sometlimes leads to a situation where a support price is set but no transactions take place because no&#13;
budget is provided.  Parastatals are not efficient in the handling of crops.  They also collude witl&#13;
processors or traders to share the gains from monopolistic market positions.&#13;
2.22           Farmers sell surplus production to iiidividual buyers, Government or semi-government&#13;
procuremenit agencies and agro-processing plants, or at village markets where transactions are carried out&#13;
by brokers, traders. amid commission agents. Further up the marketing chain is a wide network of iehsil&#13;
level markets through whiclh agricultural commodities from the village markets are channeled by brokers,&#13;
wholesalers amid retailers to the larger urban centers for sale to consumers and for export. The project area&#13;
has several major marketing centers at district and tehsil levels.  Present marketing and processing&#13;
facilities are adequate to handle the project's estimated outputs.&#13;
2.23           Currently, about 60 percent of Pakistan's wheat production is consumed on the farm or&#13;
sold in the open market and the rest is marketed in the public sector. Public sector procurement is carried&#13;
out bv the Provincial Food Departments and the Pakistan Agricultural Storage and Services Corporation.&#13;
About half of Pakistan's total paddy production is consumed on the farm, while most of the marketable&#13;
surplus is bougIlt by the state-ownied Rice Export Corporation and is exported. Cotton and sugarcanie are&#13;
sold, either directly or through an intermediary, to ginneries and sugar mills. Ginned cotton is conisumned&#13;
domestically as well as exported by the state-ownied Cotton Export Corporatiomi and private firms. In areas&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
wilere there are no sugar mills, sugarcanie is usually processed into gur (raw sugar) for local consumption.&#13;
2.24           Altlhoughi direct intervenition by the Government in agricultural markets has diminished,&#13;
major interventions still remaini --subsidized imports of wheat; duty and periodic restrictions on cotton&#13;
exports, aiid protection of sugarcanie. Major indirect interventionis arise from the protection of domestic&#13;
industry, whiicih penalizes agriculture througlh the impact on sectoral relative prices. These issues were&#13;
analyzed in the recent agriculture sector strategy and it is intenided that they would be addressed through&#13;
a sector operation focussing mainly on structural and policy reforms in the agriculture sector.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives&#13;
3.1            The overall project objectives are to increase the scope and productivity of Punjab's&#13;
irrigationi and drainage subsector and increase farners' incomes. Its specific objectives are to: (a) redefine&#13;
Governimienit's role in groundwater developmenlt and provide assistance to facilitate chanige; (b) develop&#13;
a monitoring program and regulatory framework to ensure sustainable use of the grouLidwater resources;&#13;
(c) develop sustainable farmers' organizationis (FOs) which can efficiently operate and maintain&#13;
groulidwater irrigation, improve surface irrigation and establish a base for participation in the management&#13;
of the canal systems; (d) increase beneficiaries' incomiies and alleviate poverty; (e) rationalize public&#13;
expenditure on O&amp;M  of the irrigation and drainage systems as well as increase the recovery of public&#13;
expeniditures on irrigation infrastructure; and (f) avoid environimenital hlazard of saline water intrusion into&#13;
fresh grounidwater aquifers.&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
3 .2           T he proposed project covering a large part of fresh grounidwater SCARP areas in Punjab,&#13;
would be implemiienited over a period of five years. The project is designed to meet the above objectives.&#13;
The major project components are: (a) disinvestmenit of SCARP tubewells; (b) development of a&#13;
grounddwater mon itorinlg and regulatory framework; (c) improvement of irrigation conveyanice facilities;&#13;
(d) preventioni of saline groundwater intrusion in fresh aquifers; (e) monitoring and evaluation of the&#13;
project imipact: and (f) project management, and technical assistance and training.&#13;
3.3            The proiect would be a major step towards self-sustainability of the irrigation and drainage&#13;
systems in Pun jab by developing sustainable FOs and transferring to them responsibility for O&amp;M  of&#13;
STWs, whichi requires over forty percent of provincial current irrigation expenditure. At the same time,&#13;
distributioll of irrigation water from tubewells would be transferred from provincial irrigation agency to&#13;
the private sector. While decentralization of management and water markets in surface irrigation requires&#13;
experimentation throughi pilot projects, much experience exists on the involvement of the private sector&#13;
in groulidwater development. Tubewell water sales are common and development of FOs around tubewell&#13;
installationis is easier. Well-developed FOs and a framework for groundwater regulation would help in&#13;
the decenitralizationi of surface irrigation system  at canal command level, which would be addressed&#13;
throughi a series of pilot projects under sector loans.&#13;
Tubewells Disinvestment (Base Cost USS27.4 million)&#13;
3.4    Transfer of SCARP Tubewells (Base Cost US$12.5 million).              All  public   SCARP&#13;
tubewells presently operational in the fresh groundwater areas of the project would be transferred to thle&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
private sector. The project would provide assistance in the development of FOs and transfer of STWs to&#13;
them. Watercourse level FOs with minimum  membership of 51 percent of the water users on the&#13;
watercourse would be registered prior to formation of CTW FOs. CTW FOs would consist of a minimum&#13;
of 30 percent of the water users on the watercourse.&#13;
3.5           It is estimated that there are about 4.233 SCARP tubewells with an actual pumping&#13;
capacity of about 9,597 cusecs (Aninex I, Tables 6 and 9). Of these about 642 tubewells are in good&#13;
conditioni with effective capacity (ECAP) more than 80 percent (called Class A tubewells), about 1,077&#13;
are in medium condition (ECAP 80-50 percent, Class B) and about 1,788 in bad condition (ECAP less&#13;
thani 50%, Class C). About 353 STWs are not operational, and no data are available for about 373 STWs.&#13;
3.6           The transfer program is designed not to exceed the present pumping capacity of STWs,&#13;
and allowing flexibility of choices to the FOs. Farmers in the project area would be persuaded through&#13;
a social mobilization program  for forming FOs to take over the STWs and run those as community&#13;
tubewells (CTWs). FOs would chose the transfer and managemenit method suitable for their area. The&#13;
following are the likely options: (i) jointly take over STW as such and run as CTW (transfer mode); (ii)&#13;
jointly take over the STW  with modificalion and run as CTW; (iii) install new CTWs serving all or part&#13;
of the farmers served by STW; and (iv) replace lost pumpage with existing or new PTWs. The project&#13;
would provide assistance for CTWs only. The project would support one to two CTWs per watercourse&#13;
with a discharge capacity of one to two cusecs (average 1.5 cusecs), each pumping into the communal&#13;
watercourse (preferably at the head) with a maximum of four CTWs per STW (only for STWs serving&#13;
more than one watercourse). In case of transfer mode only one CTW would be needed as it is likely to&#13;
have sufficient capacity to serve all farmers on the watercourse.&#13;
3.7           Under the transfer mode, FOs would carry out minor repairs to starters, switches, motors,&#13;
pumpset couplings and make a security deposit for electrical connection. Under the modified mode, they&#13;
would replace the turbine pump with a centrifugal pump of lower capacity (average 1.5 cusecs) and the&#13;
electrical motor with a diesel enginie. The new CTWs are likely to be below 2 cusecs capacity with&#13;
ceentrifugal pumps operated by diesel engines.&#13;
3.8           It is estinated that (and assumed for costing and financing) all STWs in the project area&#13;
would be replaced by about 6,360 CTWs under the three transfer modes (Annex 2 Table 1). This&#13;
averages to 1.5 CTW per STW or about 1.2 CTW per watercourse or 60 percent of the watercourses&#13;
participating in the program with two CTWs each. It is estimated that about 150 STWs" in good&#13;
conditioni (Class A) would be taken over by FOs in the transfer mode. Some 1,643 STWs would be&#13;
modified and converted to CTWs. These would inciude all those working moderately well, and some of&#13;
those in poor condition. About 4,567 new CTWs would be installed. The number of tubewells under&#13;
different categories are indicative and may change during the course of project implementation. The&#13;
project would provide one tine finanicial assistance of Rs. 20,000 for modified and Rs. 30,000 for new&#13;
CTWs. This represents about 45 percenlt of the cost for new CTW and about 50 percent for modified&#13;
CTWs (Aninex 2, Table 3). The incentive structure would encourage the transfer and modified modes.&#13;
FOs would provide unskilled labor and bear remaining costs of CTWs. They would be responsible for&#13;
O&amp;M of CTWs and deposit an amount equivalent of one seasons's (six months) O&amp;M  in their Bank&#13;
AccouLit to be eligible for finanicial assistance.&#13;
3.9           In addition to the SCARP tubewells there are about 1,535 irrigation tubewells, in Punjab&#13;
owned by the Goverinment. Most of these tubewells are not operational. However, a significant amount&#13;
of funds are allocated in the recurrent budget to meet their fixed costs. Assurance were obtained from&#13;
Including 50 STWs in SCARP Shahpur whicih are shallow and fitted with centrifugal pumps.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
GOPunjab that Government owned irrigation tubewells would be formally closed by June 30, 1998. and&#13;
GOPunjab would. (a) eliminate the provincial program for subsidizing individually owned private&#13;
tubewells in areas supplied by canal waler by September 30, 1996; and (b) initiate a study for the&#13;
preparation of a plan to phase out subsidies to the individually-owned private tubewells in areas not&#13;
supplied by canal water and where private tubewells are the sole source of irrigation water, and&#13;
implement such plan by December 31, 1997.&#13;
3.10   Community Development and Support (Base Cost US$6.7 million).          To achieve project&#13;
objectives, a basic requirement would be effective communllity participation in all phases of the&#13;
developmenit process. An essential activity is to set up, train and technilcally support FOs so that they are&#13;
able to effectively manage and sustaini the operation of CTWs. The FOs would be used as nuclei bodies&#13;
for other project activities such as improvement of irrigation and drainage systems. For developing&#13;
effective FOs, the project would support a social mobilization program. The PMU would have overall&#13;
responsibility for social mobilizationi working through a communily development and support group&#13;
(CDSG) recruited as consultancy services. The team would consist of core staff at the central level for&#13;
training, managing and coordinating the community participation program, social coordinators (SCs) in&#13;
the project area, and social organizers (SOs) working with the help of local NGOs and village level&#13;
activists. In order to recruit SOs who reside in the project areas and maintain relationship with farmers,&#13;
they would be recruited from local-level NGOs. The terms of reference for social mobilization team are&#13;
given in Annex 3.&#13;
3.11          PMU would also utilize the services of OFWM staff especially where they are involved&#13;
in the inproveinenit of watercourses. The OFWM teams would privatize 1,500 STWs, including 500&#13;
STWs on already improved watercourses, 500 on the watercourses improved under the project and 500&#13;
on ullimproved watercourses. The OFWM teams would be modified to include social organizers, who&#13;
would be trained by the CDSG.&#13;
3.12          A detailed community development plan is given in Annex 4.  The community&#13;
mobilizationi efforts would be carried out in three successive waves. First, a baseline survey of the STW&#13;
area would be carried out hy surveyors for collecting pertinent information about the STW and&#13;
watercourse comimianid. This inforimiationi would cover physical features, agricultural aspects, as well as&#13;
socio-economic factors.  Based on this information, SOs would prepare a suitable plan and initiate&#13;
dialogue with the farmers for replacing STW pumpage. The SOs would make an initial visit followed&#13;
by several return visits. The After-care Social Organizers (ASOs) would also participate in some of the&#13;
returni visits. Each SO would be visiting up to four STWs within the same geographical area at a given&#13;
time. To take advantage of the demonstrative effect, the visit schedule would be a rolling process,&#13;
whereby the SO would advance to the next closest STW. If an FO is formed for converting an STW to&#13;
CTW, the SO would arrange visits of technical staff to assist FO in deciding type of tubewell, size,&#13;
location and other technical issues. When a CTW is established by an FO, follow-up and training would&#13;
be carried out by SOs supported by the ASOs. They would assist FOs in electing/appointing the necessary&#13;
officers and assign specific responsibilities to FO members, open bank accounts, and provide training in&#13;
book-keeping. preparing and implementing water distribution and maintenanlce schedules, amid dispute&#13;
resolutioii technilques. The ASOs would make regular visits to provide support in the post-transition&#13;
period until the FO begins to function satisfactorily. ASOs would also monitor the performance of the&#13;
FOs. The work of SOs would be supervised by Social Coordinators (SCs). The SCs would also be&#13;
supported by a technical team (Technical Coordinator, Irrigation Engineer and Agricultural Economist)&#13;
and a survey team (Irrigation Engineer, Agricultural Economist and two surveyors). The CDSG would&#13;
have its main office in Lahore and four field offices (Chart 2).&#13;
3.13          Under the community development program, the project would provide support for about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
445 staff years for social mobilization field staff. Of these, about 225 staff years would be for social&#13;
organizers (primary and after-care), 20 staff years of Social Coordinators and remaining for technical staff,&#13;
survey teams and support staff. The core team (125 staff months) at the Lahore office would consist of&#13;
a Team Leader supported by a Deputy Team Leader, a Social Mobilization Specialist (15 staff months)&#13;
and a Training Specialist (5 staff months). Strong back-up support would be provided for the SOs through&#13;
a training program (one month) and expert advice from the core team. The Training Specialist would help&#13;
to develop trainin1g and promotional material, an appropriate book-keeping system, and an implementation&#13;
hanidbook. The project would also support one week training of FOs and farmlers' leaders.&#13;
3.14   Redeployment of STWs Staff (Base Cost US$8.2 million).  The staff presently employed for&#13;
O&amp;M of STWs would have to be redeployed as the transfer of public tubewells proceeds. Presently about&#13;
7,100 Governmelt employees are employed for the O&amp;M of these tubewells (Annlex 2, Table 4). Of&#13;
these, about 1,000 (14 percent) who have more thani 25 years of service and are eligible for full pension&#13;
at retirement, are likely to take retirement during restructuring of PID. The project would support a&#13;
training program for about 3,100 staff (44 percent). After taking the training they can be redeployed in&#13;
other branchies of the Government or find employment in the private sector. About 3,000 staff would need&#13;
to be offered attractive incentives if they are to voluntarily leave PlD's service. IDA would provide funds&#13;
for the training program.  However, the Government would finance from  its own resources&#13;
retirement/severanice benefits for the employees leaving the Government service. The Government would&#13;
make use of skilled humani resources development specialists for the implementationi of the staff re-&#13;
deploymenit program  and for counselling and providing assistance and advice to the STWs staff.&#13;
Assurance were obtained that GOPunjab wouldJfinalize the training program and severance packages by&#13;
Decemnber 31, 1996 in consultation with the STWs staff  The GOPunjab would make provisions in its&#13;
operating b7udget/for retirement/severance benefits (as appropriate) for the staff whose employment would&#13;
cease cduring the following fiscal year and ensure that such benefits are made available to the eligible&#13;
stafjf: The statf receiving severance benefits would not be re-hired within a period of seven years from the&#13;
dlate theY cease to be emnployed by the Governnment.&#13;
Development of Groundwater Regulatory Framework (Base Cost US$2.8 million)&#13;
3.15         In Punljab, groundwater extractions have been increasinig consistenltly, as a result the falling&#13;
water tables in some fresh groundwater areas is a matter of considerable concerin. Over exploitation&#13;
threatenis the quality of the resource --lower level aquifers are generally more saline, and significant&#13;
differences between fresh and saline areas induce intrusion of saline water. As the rate of groundwater&#13;
use is approaching its potential availability, determination of groundwater rights (at individual and&#13;
comm1iulnity level) and regulation of its use are essential for sustainable and equitable use of this common&#13;
resoLirce.  The project would support the development as well as implementationi of a regulatory&#13;
framework. It would strengthen capacity for intensive monitoring in critical areas, develop capacity for&#13;
determining safe yields of aquifers and allocation of groundwater rights, as well as develop and support&#13;
for the institutionial setip for implementing groundwater regulations in critical areas. Detailed program&#13;
for the development and implementationi of regulatory framework is provided il Annex 5.&#13;
3.16          Presently, the SCARPs Monitorinig Organization (SMO) of WAPDA  monitors the&#13;
grounidwater aquifers, especially in the SCARP areas. SMO's capacity for country wide monitoring would&#13;
be strengthenied under the proposed National Drainage Program. The proposed project would strengthen&#13;
Pull jab's capacity for intensive monitorinig of the areas identified as critical for groundwater control on&#13;
the basis of SMOs general monitoring results. In addition to the groundwater monitoring database,&#13;
simulation  models would be employed in determining the safe yield of aquifers and its allocation by&#13;
distributary, watercourse and individual level. Detailed rules for control and licensing, as well as the&#13;
methodology and institutional setup would be developed. The development work would be completed in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
first three years of the project, while the institutional setup for enforcemenit of regulation in critical areas&#13;
would be put in place during the remaining two years. As part of developing effective groundwater&#13;
regulation strategy, a few pilots would be implemented before refining the regulation procedures. The&#13;
objectives of the pilots would be to test and evolve most effective methods for groundwater managemenit,&#13;
assessment of the extent of regulation required, effectiveness of allocation and distribution of grounldwater&#13;
rights, and roles of the regulating and monitoring agencies, surface water and drainage agencies, the&#13;
farmers and their organizationis, local governmeits and NGOs in implementationi of the grounidwater&#13;
regulations. For development of a regulatory framework, the project would provide support for about 280&#13;
staff monithis of' internationally and nationially recruited specialists.  In addition assistance uould be&#13;
provided for support staff and installatioii of moniitoriig equipmenit. and computers.  Funding is also&#13;
ilided for about 250 staff monithis along withi support staff for the institutional setup to be established&#13;
for entorcing the regulationis. The project would also support training in groundwater modelinig and&#13;
regulation. and visits to othier countries whiere such measures have been implemented.&#13;
Improvement of Irrigation Facilities in Fresh Groundwater Areas (Base Cost US$33.6 million)&#13;
3.17    Watercourse Renovations (Base Cost US$30.5 million).  Watercourses generally command&#13;
between 75 to 200 ha anid serve about 25 to 70 farmers.  The communal watercourse (sarktiri khal)&#13;
represent about 20 percent of W/C lengthi with the remaininig 80 percent being farm  branchies anid field&#13;
ditches. With closure ot' STWs the water flow rate in W/Cs as well as pattern of flows would change&#13;
sign ificantly"v. Depending upon the location of CTW, the flow would be reduced to hialf in miost W/Cs.&#13;
Therelore, the W/Cs svould have to be remodelled to convey the new water flows efficiently and equitably.&#13;
3. 18           The communal W/C whicih conveys a large portion of the irrigation water would be&#13;
realigined and rebuilt with clean compacted soil to improve coniveyance of the canal as well as CTW  water.&#13;
Precast outlets (pIwcc  nlaC''cus) would be installed to reduce channel deterioration and water loss, arid to&#13;
improve water control. The critical sections of communal W/C prone to speedy deterioration would be&#13;
lhied with bricks or three-piece precast concrete slabs.29  Normally, head reaches of W/Cs. havilng&#13;
maximum  flows aiid hydraulic head wvould be Ihied. However, other reaches having excessive water&#13;
losses because of elevation, soil conditioiis. chronic sedimentation problems, and higih traffic areas around&#13;
villages and alonig the roads would also be eligible for pucca lining. The Iining would not exceed 15&#13;
percent of the total length of communal W/CI  lowever, greater flexibility would be allowed to FOs in&#13;
selecting the sections for Iining. Culverts would be installed at major crossings, and a limited nuimber of&#13;
check/drop strictures, animiial wallos/buffalo baths and laundry sites would be provided as required.&#13;
3.19            The project would only support renovation of W/Cs on which CTWs are installed. There&#13;
are about 5,266 W/Cs in the project area, however, the project would support renovation of about 1,500&#13;
W/Cs in the FGjW  areas. W/C renovationi would be undertaken after FO have successfully operated the&#13;
CTW  for at least one year. FOs would provide unskilled and skilled labor (masons) costs. They would&#13;
contribute at least 30 percent of the material costs up-froiit and 45 percenit of the material cost would be&#13;
payable in six histalniiients over a three year period (Annex 2 Table 5). FOs could use the income from&#13;
sale of CTW  water to finaiice cash contributions. The SOs would provide assistance in deterniining&#13;
appropriate sales price for CTW  water in order to fund cash contributions; and training in collection,&#13;
keep ing separate records and operation of bank accounts.&#13;
The STNs generalls pump three time the discharge from canals in the W/Cs. With the closure of STW and without CTW at the head&#13;
ot the WIC the discharge will be reduced to one third in most cases, furthermore, the pattern of flows would differ depending upon&#13;
the location as well as number of CTWs on a watercourse.&#13;
'    The liing will be a rectangular double-brick masonry wall (23 cm) and a brick masonry bed (7 cm) plastered inside and on top of&#13;
the wall. Three-piece precast slabs. costing about the same, could be a substitute where good quality bricks are difficult to hioid.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
3.20          The annual program for W/Cs renovations would be prepared at the beginning of the each&#13;
fiscal year. W/Cs would have to meet two specific criteria to be considered for imuprovemnents. First, they&#13;
must have had a registered W/C level association in the previous fiscal year, and second, they must score&#13;
highest according to the criteria outlined in Table 3. I.  The criteria assigns highi priority to the&#13;
watercoLirses with large nuinber of small farmiers. The rank of each watercourse would be determinied&#13;
based on numnber of beneficiaries (500 points), comimiand area (200 points) and up-front contributioni&#13;
towards the cost ot materials. The score between the points given in the table would be determinied usiig&#13;

3.21   The OFWM  Directorate would assigni 20 field teams and 4 area teams to improve these&#13;
watel-coLirses. T he composition of the field teams is giveni in Ann1ex 2, Table 6. TIhe field team staff has&#13;
been reduced from the present level employed for W/C improvemenit uLider the Third On-farm Water&#13;
Managemiienit project. However, the team would be supplemented with a Commniiiuity Development Officer&#13;
to enhlanice its social mobilizationl capacity.  TIhese teams would also be trained by the in social&#13;
mobilizationi by the Core Team of the CDSG.&#13;
3.22   Rehabilitation of Canal Structures (Base Cost US$3.1 million).    With the closure of STWs,&#13;
a large numilber of farmers in the project area would rely on canal water alone until the CTWs become&#13;
operational. To ensure a reliable supply of canal water during this period, as well as conjunctive use of&#13;
groundwater after CTWs become operational, the project would provide assistance to remove major&#13;
physical obstructions in the delivery of canal water. This would include repair of distributary gates,&#13;
rehabilitationi of diversion structures, desilting and improving critical sections of the canial and other&#13;
adjustments to enable delivery of authorized disclharge. Before closing STWs in ain area, a survey would&#13;
be caried out and a plaii 'Aould be prepared for rehabilitation of the distribution system. These works&#13;
would not cover complete remodelling of the distributaries and should cost below Rs 200 per acre (fiscal&#13;
near 1995). The works would be identified and proposed by Social Mobilization Field Teams and the PID&#13;
durinig tile project implemenitation. The canal lining consultants would review and prepare detailed designs&#13;
for the rehabilitation works in consultations with the FOs and Social Mobilization Field Teams.&#13;
Prevention of Saline Groundwater Intrusion (Base Cost US$24.7 million)&#13;
3.23          Even in tile FGW SCARP areas the groundwater quality varies over a wide range witlh&#13;
fresh and saline areas interminigled at some locations. SCARP 11 have a large saline zone where the water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
table is higher than the adjoining fresh groundwater areas and saliie intrusions are occurring. The project&#13;
would support measures to control spreading of the saline groundwater aquifer iito fresh areas. This&#13;
would be achieved by rehabilitating and improving the drainage facilities in the saline areas bordering the&#13;
freshwater aquifers. as well as by reducing drainage requirements through preventive measures and by&#13;
improving delivery efficiencies of canals and watercourses.&#13;
3.24   Improvement of Drainage Facilities (Base Cost US$0.2 million).   In SCARP 11, about 35&#13;
saline tubewells (with a pumping capacity of 2 cusecs). would be installed to replace the pumpage of&#13;
existing drainage tubewells whichi have either deteriorated to a very low capacity or have been abandoned.&#13;
These drainage wells would be installed in the vicinity of Shah Jiwana and Ara units of SCARP-II, and&#13;
effluent would be pumped into existing surface drains. Bordering Shall Jiwana unit, the replacement&#13;
tubewells would be provided along Faqarian-Sillanlwali drain (8 tubewells) and Sobagha drain (12&#13;
tubewells); and in Ara unit along lower Raniwah drain (15 tubewells). This capacity, together with&#13;
proposed preventive measures, would be sufficient to balance recharge and extractions and maintain the&#13;
grounidwater tables at an appropriate level in the saline areas bordering with FGW, and help prevent their&#13;
spread.&#13;
3.25           While the O&amp;M of all STWs has generally been plagued by problems arising from poor&#13;
management and budgetary shortfalls, the salile STWs are the worst hit, primarily because, unlike the&#13;
fresh groundwater STWs. farmers are not interested in their O&amp;M. Most of the saline tubewells are either&#13;
permaniently closed or in highily deteriorated conditioni. To avoid a similar fate of the saline STWs&#13;
proposed to be rehabilitated or replaced in the SCARP 11 area, the O&amp;M of these saline STWs would be&#13;
contracted out to the private sector under "performance contracts". In addition efforts would be made&#13;
throughi tihe social mobilization teams to involve farmers in watch and ward, monitoring of hours of&#13;
operation and general O&amp;M of these tubewells.&#13;
3.26   Canal Improvements (Base Cost US$9.2 million).  In addition to rehabilitation of drainage&#13;
facilities, water conservation measures (by improving the delivery efficiency of canals and watercourses)&#13;
would be used for controlling the groundwater tables and reducing the drainage requirements in saliie&#13;
areas at the interface with the fresh groundwater areas. About 26 channels in SCARP 11 with capacity&#13;
upto about 100 cusecs (2.8 m3/sec) capacity would be provided with improved water control structures&#13;
as well as lining where found appropriate30 (Annex 2. Table 7). All of the chaniels selected il SCARP&#13;
11 area are supplied by Lower Jehlum Canal. The total length of the liied sections would be about 180&#13;
kim. Several of these chanlnels cross a depression running parallel to the branch canal therefore their&#13;
middle section is significanitly highier than the ground level. Breaches often occur at these sections&#13;
crossing the depression resulting in significant loss in water and crop failures in the tail. Lining these&#13;
reaches would result in water savings as well as improved distribution of water towards the tail.&#13;
3.27           The liied section would be designed to carry the actual discharge, and adequate freeboard&#13;
would be provided for safe operation. Moghas would be remodelled, canal structures would be improved,&#13;
and control structures would be provided to meet water management requirements. The lining would&#13;
conisist of concrete placed on compacted subgrade. Trapezoidal sections with side slope of 1:1 for up to&#13;
0.85 cumecs and 1.5:1 for higher discharge with non-silting velocities would be used. Parabolic sections&#13;
would be considered for small size sections (less than 0.5 cumecs).&#13;
3.28           PID would consult the farmers benefiting from these improvement at the start of the&#13;
project. The channels on which farmers agree to pay at least 5 percent of the capital costs of works up-&#13;
front, and 50 percent of the capital cost over a period of 8 years would be considered for improvements.&#13;
'" Seepage tests would be carried out before finalizing the canal lining designs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
IPreference wouild be given to those channels where farmiers would make higher up-fronit contributions.&#13;
3.29           These improvemiients wvould reduce thc losses significanitly and, as the area is uliderlain&#13;
by SGA'. would coniserve valuable sulface water. Improvemiient in ~Nater conitrol and remaodellinig of&#13;
tnuoghav would reCSlt in an overall increase in water use efficiency and equitable water delivery to&#13;
watercourses, especially towards the tail-end reaches of the canals.&#13;
33(0   Watercourse Improvements (Base Cost US$15.3 million).   About 100 watercourses in the&#13;
saline pockets and 400 in saline areas adjoininig the fresh groundwater aquifers would be inproved under&#13;
a voluntary and participatory program (preference would be give to saline pockets). Specifications and&#13;
the selcction criteria for W/C improvements would be similar to the one's in fresh grounldwater areas&#13;
-xcept lip to 30 percenit of the length of comImIllulial W/C woruld be provide(d with liniing. Five field tcamiis&#13;
would be assigned to tills com1ponelt.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation (Base Cost US$2.6 million)&#13;
3.3 1          Physical and finanicial monitorinig of project progress would be the responsibility of Project&#13;
Managemilenit Unit (PMU). Data on key project indicators would be collected and analyzed regularly to&#13;
assess progress, exercise control and identify possible problems. The key indicators would include project&#13;
planning, programming and budgeting, performanice of the consultanits and contractors, cost recovery from&#13;
Lisers, effectiveness of operations, delivery of water and drainage services, water-logginig and salinity.&#13;
heneficiary participation and activities of the FOs.&#13;
3.3    Project Impact Evaluation.  The pro'ect would also include a programll tor monitoring and&#13;
evxaluation of project imipact. Either consultanlts or an indepenidenit organizationi would be engaged to carry&#13;
out project impact studies. Limited input from expatriate specialists would also be provided. [he project&#13;
imipact evaluationi studies would foCus on1: (i) agricultural growth and crop diversification: (ii) impact on&#13;
incomiie and employmeit, and secondary effects on regional econoimy; (iii) impact on groundwater aquifers&#13;
anid water quality: (iv) imipact on water use and equity in distribution: and (v) performance of FOs.&#13;
Baseline surveys would be completed withinl one year of the start of the project.  During project&#13;
implemilenitation, baseline data would be compared to oil-goinig data collected in terms of the development&#13;
indicators, to monitor and evaluate the progress made towards achieving project objectives. Draft terms&#13;
of referenice for the impact evaluationi studies are giveni in Ann1ex 6.&#13;
Project Management (Base Cost US$1.7 million)&#13;
).33           The Project Managemenit Unit (PMU). established  in the Punjab  Planninig and&#13;
Developimienit Board would maniage and coordinate overall project implemenitationi. and directly implemilenit&#13;
some of the project components. The PMU would be composed of a full time Project Director (PD), two&#13;
ex-officio Members (one each from  the Irrigation Department aiid the Directorate General of Water&#13;
Managenment), and three Directors as well as support staff. The PMU would be supported by consultants&#13;
for: (i) social mobilization/organization, (ii) management and engineering consultants; (iii) development&#13;
of groulidwater regulatory framework: (iii) M&amp;E: and (iv) project impact evaluation. To assist PMU&#13;
ulidertake its implemilenitationi responisibilities, the project would provide the cost of office buildings,&#13;
firillitire, office and field equipment, computers. and vehicles (Anniex 2. Table 7). The project would also&#13;
provide fuLids for an initial project lauLIcIh workshop, followed by two procuremilenlt guidelinles workshops.&#13;
mid-term  review and services for detailed third-party supervision on behalf of the Government. The&#13;
Planning and Developmenit Board would hire, indepenidenitly of the PMU, the services of two or more&#13;
specialists to carry out detailed supervision of the project oii belialf of the GOPunjab fromii time to time&#13;
(aboLit twice a year) and submit full supervision reports. The PMU would be responsible tor qualitN&#13;

control of all civil works carried out under the project. Assurances were obtained fron GOPunljab thal&#13;
proper specifications and design criteria would be observed for all civil works constructed under ihe&#13;
project and measures would be taken to control quality of construction acceptable to IDA.&#13;
Technical Assistance and Training (USS2.4 million).&#13;
3.34          Technical Assistance and traininig is an integral part of the project. Each component&#13;
includes required TA and traininig. In addition, the project would provide for national and interinationial&#13;
study tours. TA and traininig in beneficiary participation, community development and strengthleniiig,&#13;
project plaiinililg and managemenit; and moderin constructioni and contract adm in istrationi techiniques. The&#13;

bidding documents, short-term training including overseas training for the project staff and preparation&#13;
of a follow up project for privatiziig remaining public tubewells in the province. The TA would also&#13;
support pilot projects to enhance agricultural productivity by improving water use efficiency at the farn&#13;
level. water maniagemlienit. farmers training, farmers participation in drainage, and developing methods of&#13;
construction at the canal level and contractinig arrangements with full participation by the farmers.&#13;
Assurances wvere obtainedfrom GOPunjab that PMU wouldfurnish proposalsfor staff training under ihe&#13;
project to IDA fbr its prior review and approval.  In addition the PMU would carry out a study on&#13;
feasibility of FOs raising resources throughi public borrowing. The purpose would be for a selected&#13;
nuinber of FOs to augment their internal cash generation with public borrowing in order to finanice a&#13;
greater portion of future investment with non-governmental funds. The PMU would prepare the TOR for&#13;
this study in consultationi with IDA. The study would be completed by March 31, 1999. The PMU would&#13;
also carry out a study for the preparation of a plan to phase out subsidies to the individually-owned private&#13;
tubewells in areas not supplied by canal water and where private tubewells are the sole source of irrigation&#13;
water (para 3.9).&#13;
3.36          Assurances were obtained from he Government that consultants would be recruited&#13;
following Bank guidelines under terms of reference acceptable to IDA.  The project implementation&#13;
consultants would be duly employed and are on location and ready to commence operations before credit&#13;
efJectiveness. The technilcal proposals for consulting services for project implementation have been invited&#13;
from the short listed firms, the consultants selection would be completed before the Board approval. For&#13;
recruitment of Monitorinig and Evaluation consultants, proposals have been invited from the short listed&#13;

IV. COST ESTIMATES, FINANCING AND DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
A. Project Costs Estimates&#13;
4.1                 Total Project costs are estimated at US$104.8  million (Rs. 4,139  million) equivalent,&#13;
includinig  physical and price contingenicies, and US$10 millioni (Rs. 389 million) in local taxes.  The&#13;
foreigii excliange componenlt is estimated at US$10.2 milliol (Rs. 398 million), or about 10 percent of&#13;
project costs.  Project cost summmaries are given  in Tables 4.1  and 4.2 and detailed  costs are given  in&#13;
Aninex 7.  Project base costs are expressed in April 1996 prices (negotiations period).  Base costs were&#13;
derived from  detailed cost analysis of recent works undertalken in ongoinig projects and market surveys.&#13;
The cost of tubewells are based  on  field  surveys anid  market prices of equipment.  The watercourse&#13;
renovationi  costs are  based  oii similar works carried  out in  PuLnjab  under oin-going  on-farm   water&#13;
maniagemilenit projects. The drainage improvemenits and canal lining costs are based on average quantities&#13;
and recenit contracts for similar works. Similarly. velicles and equipment costs, and consultancy services&#13;
costs are based oni recent contracts for comparable services in Punjab and Pakistan.  The cost estimates&#13;
include physical contingenicies applied to the base costs at the rates of 10 percent for canal lining and&#13;
drainage civil works.&#13;

4.3           Table 4.4 shows the proposed project financing plan.  Farmers' Organizations (30&#13;
percent), GOPunjab/GOP (16 percent), and IDA (54 percent) would jointly finance the project. FOs&#13;
would provide about Rs. 1,256 million (US$31.8 million), of which roughly Rs. 657 million (US$16.8&#13;
million) would be in civil works and materials and Rs. 599 million (US$15 million) in skilled and&#13;
unskilled labor. IDA would provide a credit of SDR 38.5 million (US$56 million, equivalent to Rs.&#13;
2,220 million), and GOPunjab/GOP the remaining Rs 663 million (US$17 million). IDA's credit would&#13;
finance 54 percent of project costs, including 100 percent of foreign exchange costs and 48 percent of&#13;
local costs. IDA's financing is about 77 percent of the project costs excluding FOs share, and 89 percent&#13;
excluding duties and taxes.  GOPunjab/GOP would provide its share of project finances to the&#13;

jurisdiction of the Member (Irrigation). Specifically the PID would:&#13;
a.    issue official notifications for and implement closure of STWs according to work plans&#13;
agreed with the PD PMU;&#13;
b.     ensure timely retrieval of closed STWs' machinery, to free-up boreholes for installation&#13;
of CTWs, through contracts or auction;&#13;
c.    identify minor and distributary canals to be lined, based on measurement of water losses,&#13;
This would done thirough open auction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
risk of breaching, and willingness of FOs in meeting the full capital cost;&#13;
d.     encourage formation of FOs along the canals with assistance from the CDSG;&#13;
e.     award and manage contracts for canal lining, improvement of structures, and&#13;
rehabilitation of drainage tubewells;&#13;
f.     encourage farmer participation in the watch and ward, and O&amp;M of drainage tubewells&#13;
rehabilitated under the project, and award "performance contracts" for O&amp;M; and&#13;
g.     implement the staff re-deployment package.&#13;
5.8    The PAD, through the Directorate General of Water Management, would be responsible for&#13;
improving watercourses. and establishing FOs and CTWs in designated areas.  The DG Water&#13;
Management would designate a Project Manager. and assign four Area and twenty five Field teams to&#13;
carry out these activities. The Member (Water Management) would, inter alia, be responsible for: (i)&#13;
ensuring close coordination between the PMU and the Directorate General of Water Management; (ii)&#13;
drafting necessary bye laws for WUAs and FOs to allow ownership and/or leasing of CTWs/land; and&#13;
(ifi) preparing innovative designs for layout of CTWs so that they could be installed on the public land&#13;
along the watercourses. Specifically, the PAD would:&#13;
a.     carry out Watercourse Assessment Surveys in areas designated by the PMU;&#13;
b.     deploy trained Social Organizers in the designated areas to mobilize farmer support for&#13;
the STW privatization, and assist farmers in forming viable FOs and installing CTWs;&#13;
c.     disburse financial incentives for CTWs in a timely manner33;&#13;
d.     provide follow-on "after-care" services to FOs to ensure organizational sustainability, and&#13;
provide technical assistance in tubewell operation and maintenance, improved water&#13;
management and improved agronomic practices;&#13;
e.     liaise closely with the CDSG of the PMU to avail training programs for SOs. and&#13;
maintain consistency of approach and methodology for social mobilization activities;&#13;
f.     establish water users associations and improve watercourses;&#13;
g      ensure timely recovery of farmers' share of watercourse improvement costs; and&#13;
h.     submit periodic progress reports to the PMU.&#13;
5.9    NGO's Role.   Currently there are no NGOs in Punjab with experience in establishing FOs and&#13;
capable of assuming full responsibility for managing an extensive social mobilization program needed for&#13;
the project. However, some local service NGOs have working relationships with local community based&#13;
organizations (CBOs) and/or local activists who could help mobilize farmer participation in the project.&#13;
Wherever feasible, the PMU will seek cooperation of local service NGOs and CBOs either directly or&#13;
through the PIA consultants to assist with community mobilization. In selecting NGOs/CBOs, it would&#13;
be ensured that they: (a) are legally registered and maintain accounts that are audited annually; (b) are&#13;
involved in rural development as their main objective and they are not affiliated with any political&#13;
organization; (c) have adequate number of field staff conversant with local languages and customs, and&#13;
have good knowledge and understanding of the socio-economic conditions in the area; and (d) are&#13;
supportive of the project objectives and can work in harmony with the rest of the project team.&#13;
5.10   FO's Role.    FO's would play a critical role in project implementation. They would be eligible&#13;
for receiving project assistance for establishing CTWs if they have membership of at least one-third of&#13;
the farmers within the command of an STW. FOs wishing to establish CTWs would be required to&#13;
register themselves as a water users association or its sub-group (e.g. a tubewell committee) under the&#13;
Punjab Water Users Associations Ordinance of 1981. The FOs at the CTW level would, inter alia, havc&#13;
the following responsibilities: (a) interacting with the field teams of PMU and/or OFWM staff to prepare&#13;
V The PD PMU will advance funds to the Member (Water Management) on a yearly basis based on estimated targets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
work plans for transfer of STWs; (b) determining the best option for replacing STW pumpage, in terms&#13;
of type, size and location of CTWs; (c) installing, operating and maintaining CTW, and distributing water&#13;
to its members according to agreed shares and schedules; (d) maintaining bank accounts and collecting&#13;
members' share ot capital, operation and maintenance and replacement costs; (e) maintaining capital and&#13;
O&amp;M accounts and log books; (f) improving water management in the watercourse command; and (g)&#13;
participating in watercourse and canal improvement programs.&#13;
5.11          The watercourses with working FOs where the majority of farmers agree to cooperate&#13;
for improving the watercourse and managing water deliveries at the chak level would be considered for&#13;
improvement.  In the fresh groundwater areas these FOs would qualify for project assistance for&#13;
watercourse improvements after they have effectively operated and maintained their CTWs for a period&#13;
of one year. During this period they would: (i) elect their executive committee, including a Chairman,&#13;
a General Secretary, and a Treasurer; (ii) improve distribution of canal as well as CTW water, and the&#13;
coimnmunlity and farm channels: (iii) open a bank account, generate funds for up-front contribution for&#13;
W/C improvement, from sales of CTW water and contributions from FO members; (iv) collect farmers'&#13;
shares for repayment of material costs to the government; and (v) participate in improving water&#13;
distribution at the distributary level, and collecting contributions for the capital cost of improving&#13;
distributaries.&#13;
5.12   WAPDA's Role.        WAPDA would provide electric connections to FOs who are close to&#13;
electric supply and decide to install electric CTWs. Where STWs are converted to CTWs as such under&#13;
the transferinode, WAPDA will transfer the title of electrical connection to FOs against normally needed&#13;
security deposits. It would also assist FOs in removing unnecessary electrical wiring and equipment.&#13;
B. Project Coordination&#13;
Project Coordination Committee&#13;
5.13                 At the project level, an existing Project Coordination Committee (PCC) would&#13;
be responisible for ensuring coordination among various agencies and facilitating project implementation.&#13;
The PCC would be chaired by PD of PMU and have the following members: (i) from PID: SE's of&#13;
concernedJ SCARP, canal and drainage Circles; (ii) from the PAD: the Area Coordinator of OFWM; and&#13;
the Deputy Director Agriculture; (iii) a representative of District Administration; and (iv) representatives&#13;
of selected FOs. The PCC would meet once every month. The PMU would also act as its secretariat.&#13;
Provincial Policy Committee&#13;
5.14                 The existing Provincial Policy Committee (PPC) would provide policy guidance&#13;
and steer project implementation by providing inter-agency coordination at the highest level. The PPC&#13;
would be chaired by the Chairman P&amp;D Board and the Secretaries of Irrigation, Agriculture, and Finance&#13;
would be its members. The PD of PMU would act as its secretary. The PPC would meet at least every&#13;
six months. or whenever issues requiring resolution are submitted for its consideration. The main&#13;
functions of the PPC would be to: (i) resolve issues not settled by the PCC; (ii) ensure provision of&#13;
adequate budgetary allocations for project implementation as well as operation and maintenance (O&amp;M);&#13;
(iii) ensure adequacy and continuity of PMU staff; (iv) ensure that the project complies with legal&#13;
covenants; and (v) recruit and supervise consultants to carry out full supervision of the project twice a&#13;
year, independently of the PMU.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
C. Implemnentation and Supervision&#13;
5.15   Project Start-up Activities.   The project would be implemented over a five year period&#13;
(FY1997-FY2001). The project works require relatively simple engineering designs for watercourse&#13;
improvements and canal lining, that are prepared routinely by PID, OFWM in close cooperation with&#13;
farmners. Similarly. farmers in Punjab have considerable experience in installing as well as operating and&#13;
maintaining tubewells. Drilling facilities. tubewell equipment (pumps, prime movers, screens, pipes,&#13;
etc.) and repair workshops are available locally at the village level in most areas. Project activities are,&#13;
therefore, expected to pick up as soon as the community mobilization activities are initiated. Staff for&#13;
implementationi of canal, drainage and W/Cs improvement works are already in position. Immediately&#13;
following appraisal in June 1995, GOPunijab notified the establishment of the PMU and assigned part-&#13;
time staff Assurances would be obtained at during negotiations that recruitment of full time core staff&#13;
*for the PMU (U'ull time Project Director and Directors and support staff) would be completed by September&#13;
30, 1996. The acting PD PMU has initiated procurement of consultants and equipment. GOPunjab have&#13;
approved a PC-lI that would authorize project start-up expenditures. IDA would retroactively finance&#13;
eligible start-up expenditures incurred after June 1995. The project PC-I would be submitted to PDWP&#13;
for before negotiations and its approval be a condition for the Board presentation. The implementation&#13;
plan for various project components and key performance indicators are given in Annex 9.&#13;
5.16   Project Launch Workshop. To facilitate project start-up, the PMU in collaboration with PID&#13;
and PAD, would hold a project launcil workshop sooIn after Credit signing. The workshop would, inter&#13;
atia, familiarize project staff (as well as officials of conicerned implementing and cooperating agencies)&#13;
with the project objectives, components, implementation schedule and institutional arrangements,&#13;
procurement and disbursement procedures, and monitoring and evaluation aspects of the project.&#13;
5.17   Procurement Workshops.    Several procurement workshops would be conducted to provide&#13;
assistance in the procurement planning, the use of Banks Standard Bidding document, preparation of bid&#13;
documents, evaluation of bids and award of contracts. These workshops would be organized to train local&#13;
staff in procuremenit with the aim to enhance general capability in this area and, in addition to the project&#13;
staff will be open to staff of other agencies involved in procurement under large projects.&#13;
5.18   Annual Work Plans and Progress Reporting.       The MIS of the PMU would be designed&#13;
to meet the monitoring and reporting requirements of all project components. The PIA consultants would&#13;
design an appropriate MIS system to track key project indicators and develop an "issues and actions&#13;
oriented" progress reporting format acceptable to the PMU and IDA. The PMU. with inputs from PID&#13;
and PAD, would also prepare detailed annual plans/work programs and budgets, as well as requests for&#13;
allocation of funds in the federal/provincial annual development programs. The annual plans would duly&#13;
take into account feedback from project impact evaluation studies. The PID and PAD would submit&#13;
monthly progress reports to the PMU. The PMU in turn would integrate them and submit periodic&#13;
progress reports covering all project components to the P&amp;D Board, PID, PAD and IDA.  The PMU&#13;
would also periodically prepare working papers for the PCC and PPC nmeetings. Assurances would be&#13;
obtained that by March 31 each year, the PMU would submit to IDA for its review and approval, a draft&#13;
Alnnual Plan, includinig work program and the proposed budgetary allocation for the following fiscal year.&#13;
5.19   Enhanced Governument Supervision of the Project.  In line with the decision taken during the&#13;
1995 Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR). the project provides resources to support enhanced&#13;
project supervision by GOPunjab. The P&amp;D Board would hire, independently of the PMU, services of&#13;
specialists in various fields to carry out detailed supervision of the project on behalf of GOPunjab from&#13;
time to time (cn average two times a year) and submit detailed suipervision reports. TOR of these&#13;
specialists as well as their reports would be shared with IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
5.20   IDA Supervision.    IDA would supervise the project twice a year on average. 11 required&#13;
supervision would occur more frequently during the first two years to help steer it through the start-up&#13;
stage. The project launch and procurement workshops would also be organized during this period. The&#13;
IDA supervision would comprise of one mzain supervision mission annually in the second semester of the&#13;
fiscal year, supplemented by a shorter mission in the first semester, and correspondence ani( clearances&#13;
as needed. Intensity of supervision missions would be reduced after the project is successfully past this&#13;
start-up stage. and a regime of enhaniced Government supervision has been established. Intenisive IDA&#13;
supervision during the start-up stage is justified given the nature of the project which, unlike convenitional&#13;
irrigation projects, is "software" intensive rather thani "hardware" intensive. Community mobilization&#13;
is a crucial elemenit of the project. This is a relatively new area in irrigation projects in Pakistan and&#13;
requires greater supervision inputs by IDA. Annex 9 contains IDA's proposed supervision plan. and&#13;
details of staff inputs and skill mix requirements for supervision missions. IDA supervision would be&#13;
facilitated by the proposed arrangements for enhanced Government supervision.&#13;
5.2 1         Mid-Term Review.   To evaluate the project's progress, and prospects of meeting its&#13;
objectives, a (letailed mild-term r-eviemt (MTR) would be carried out jointlv by GOPunjab, GOP and IDA&#13;
during the third year ot 'iplemien1'iation not Iitter ithan March 31, 1999. The MTR would evaluate the&#13;
overall progress and assess need for adjustments in the project scope and design, implementation approach&#13;
and methodology, and policy aspects. to ensure timely completion and achievement of project objectives.&#13;
The PMU would submit draft TOR for the MTR tor the P&amp;D Board's and IDA's review by September&#13;
30, 1998, and an MTR Preparation Report compiled with the assistance of the PIA and PIE consultants,&#13;
or other specialists by December 31. 1998.&#13;
D. Operation, Maintenance and Cost Recovery&#13;
Operation and Maintenance&#13;
, 922         FOs would be responsible for O&amp;M of tubewells as well as watercourses improved under&#13;
the project, while PID would be responsible for O&amp;M  of distributary canals and drainage facilities.&#13;
Punjab annual O&amp;M  budget for irrigation and drainage systems is about Rs. 3.9 billion (in FY 1996,&#13;
Table 5.1). The O&amp;M expenditure is lower than the requirements. The gap between the requirements&#13;
and O&amp;M expenditures varies over years. In 1994-95 it was about 13 percent compared to around 30&#13;
percent in 1993-94. Presently. O&amp;M requirement of public tubewells represent about 40 percent of total&#13;
budget requirements for O&amp;M of the irrigation and drainage systerms in the Punjab. With divestment of&#13;
STWs, GOPunjab's lhabi,ity for O&amp;M would decrease significantly (Table 5.1), thus improving its&#13;
capacity to provide adequate budget to PID for O&amp;M  of provincial irrigation and drainage systems.&#13;
Assurances were obtained during negotiations that GOPunjab will discuss wvith IDA by February, 15 of&#13;
each fiscal vear the lev'el offunding requiredfor operation and .iaintenance of the irrigation and drainage&#13;
svsrenis in Puninb.for the following fiscal vear, and basea on mutually agreed funding levels, provide&#13;
adequate budgetary allocations.&#13;
5.23          While these measures would provide relief in the short-term, it would still be difficult to&#13;
maintain the enhanced level of O&amp;M expenditures on the surface irrigation system in the long-run&#13;
because: (i) there would be competing demands for funds from other sectors; and (ii) the revenues&#13;
collected from water charges are less than 40 percent of O&amp;M expenditures. Therefore, for the long-&#13;
term self-sustainability of the irrigation and drainage, GOPunjab would initiate implementation of pilot&#13;
projects for decentralizing management at the canal command level and enhancing beneficiaries&#13;
participation in the O&amp;M of the system at distributary/minor level. To this end, the GOPunjab would&#13;
appraiseJiirst pilot project during fiscal year 1996-97 and start its implemnentation by July 1, 1998.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
5.24          The O&amp;M and cost recovery agreements reached under the Fordwah Eastern Sadiqia&#13;
(South) Project (CR. 2410-PAK) would remain in effect. These agreements require GOPunjab to: (a)&#13;
expedite disinvestment of the public tubewells as being undertaken under the proposed project; (d) discuss&#13;
and mutually agree with IDA, by February 15, each fiscal year, the level of funding required for O&amp;M,&#13;
and provide such funds for the following fiscal year (para 5.22); and (c) enhance cost recovery so as to&#13;
achieve by July 1, 1998 and then after maintain full recovery of O&amp;M costs through improving revenue&#13;
collection as well as increasing water charges.&#13;

Recovery of Capital Costs&#13;
5.25          The capital cost recovery arrangements would vary for different types of works undertaken&#13;
under the project. For SCARP Tubewells transferred as such to FOs, GOPunjab would charge them Rs.&#13;
10,000 for each STW. GOPunjab would provide a one time cash incentive of Rs. 20,000 to FOs for&#13;
installing modified CTW and Rs. 30,000 for installation of new CTW. These amounts represent about 50&#13;
percent of ihe cost of an average modified CTW and 45 percent of a new CTW. FOs would meet the&#13;
remaining capital costs. For watercourse improvements, FOs would provide skilled (masonis) and&#13;
unskilled labor, and a minimum of 30 percent of the materials costs up-front.  FOs total up-front&#13;
contributioni would thus be about 53 percent of the capital cost in FGW areas and 49 percent in saline&#13;
areas. In addition, FOs would pay back 45 percent of materials cost in six installments over a three-year&#13;
period. This results in 77 percent recovery in net present value terms, assuming an aniual interest rate&#13;
of 12 percent. Similarly, for distributaries and minors lined under the project, the beneficiaries would&#13;
contribute 5 percent of the capital cost up-front and pay another 50 percent of capital cost in installments&#13;
over a period of eight years. This results in 36 percent recovery in net present value term taking an&#13;
aniual interest rate of 12 percent. Assurance were obtained from GOPunjab for implemlentation of the&#13;
proposed capilal cost recovery plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
5.26           About 1,500 watercourses would be improved in fresh groundwater areas and about 500&#13;
in saline areas. The saline watercourses involve some exteinalities as reduction in drainage and salinity&#13;
also benefits to the farmers outside the command of the watercourses. Similarly, the canal lining works&#13;
are proposed to be carried out in areas with saline groundwater for reducing the drainage and salinity&#13;
problems and protecting fresil groundwater at the interface of fresh and saline groundwater areas. The&#13;
farmers at the tail of the lined canal would have additional water supply but a signiificant amount of&#13;
benefits would be outside the command area. Considering these externalities and the current practice of&#13;
very low and in some cases no cost recovery of capital works in irrigation and drainage sector, the&#13;
proposed capital cost recovery plan is a considerable break-through in Pakistan. In case of watercourse&#13;
improvements 77 percent recovery is a significant improvement over the current practice of recovering&#13;
only 47 percent. Similarly, in case of canal lininig works for whlich presently there is no cost recovery.&#13;
A significanit amount of up-front recover) would enhlance the real recovery levels while ensuring&#13;
participationi of farimers before the carrying out the improvemiienit works.&#13;
5.27           The capital cost recovery levels are well witliln the farmers capacity to pay. Tlley would&#13;
pay about Rs 133. Rs. 253 and Rs. 493 per ha for CTWs installed by STWs transfer, modification and&#13;
for new diesel ttibewells respectively. These cost represenit about 2, 4 and 8 percent of net annual income&#13;
from  crops of large farms and slightly less for small farms. The farmers could finance watercourse&#13;
renovationis either throughi sale of CTW water or through cash contributions. A sale price of about Rs 47&#13;
per hour (Rs. 375 per acre feet) would be enoughi to provide required funds for initial contribution and&#13;
ahout Rs. 17 per hour (Rs. 134 per AF) for installments during remaining three years. These are much&#13;
below the market price of Rs. 60 per hour for 1.5 cusec tubewells. Alternatively, the beneficiaries could&#13;
finanice these works through cash contributioni. Average zontributions are shown in Table 5.2. These&#13;
represenit a small portion of present annual farn income from crops.&#13;

5.28           Average cost of canal lining is about Rs. 4,500 per ha of cca (June, 1995 prices). The&#13;
initial conitribution would be Rs. 225 per ha with an annual instalment of Rs. 281 for 8 years. This&#13;
reflects about 3 percent of farm income (from crops).&#13;
5.29           The fariners would pay for the capital cost of installing CTWs in the first year. If they&#13;
choose to improve their watercourse, they would pay for up-front cost contributions for labor and materials&#13;
in the second year. The remaining cost of material would be paid starting form the third year. The canal&#13;
improvements would be undertaken only in saline area where the CTWs would not be installed. The&#13;
farmers could easily pay for capital costs of these works with the proposed phasing.&#13;
VI. AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, MARKETING, PRICES AND FARM INCOMES&#13;
A. Agricultural Production&#13;
6.1    The project would increase agricultural production over about 1.3 million ha, of which 1. I millionl&#13;
ha have fresh and remaining 0.2 million ha has saline groundwater. In these areas. crop production would&#13;
iicrease with project due to improved water supply and conjunctive use of surface and groundwater,&#13;
thereby helping to alleviate the deficit crop water requirements, expand the cropped area, and improve soil&#13;
conditions.&#13;
Water Availability&#13;
6.2            The condition and effectiveness of STWs would continue to decline, as it has been in the&#13;
past, and their delivery of water would likely fall to virtually nothinig over the next ten years. In the fresh&#13;
groundwater areas this would mean an overall reduction in irrigation supplies by about 26 percent. In&#13;
saline areas which depend on canals only, the irrigation water delivery at the farm level would contilnue&#13;
to decline due to deteriorating infrastructure. A significant number of large farmers already have PTWs.&#13;
After closure of STWs others who can afford them might install PTWs to replace the lost supply. This&#13;
would result in excessive installed capacity than safe aquifer yields, higher investment costs and increased&#13;
incidence of secondary soil salinity. Small farmers, on the other hand, would not be able to install PTWs.&#13;
Some would purchase PTW water from the large farms, and some small farmers, especially with&#13;
fragmented land holding, would not be able to get PTW water and their groundwater use would reduce.&#13;
With the closure of STWs the distribution of canal water would be affected adversely towards the tail of&#13;
the watercourses. The total amount of water available to small farms would fall, with a consequent&#13;
reduction in yields and cropping intensities. There are several limitations to distributing PTW water over&#13;
wider areas.:  These include: location of PTW; absence of a distribution network to other farms; higi&#13;
conveyance losses of small flows through open temporarily constructed chaninels; and difficulties in&#13;
schedulinig PTW  water during critical periods35. Although PTW  water is commonly traded among the&#13;
neighborilng farms, due to the above factors replacement of STW water with PTWs over the whole W/C&#13;
command would not be feasible without installing jointly managed and suitably located CTWs.&#13;
6.3            With the project, in areas where STWs are to be taken over by the FOs, or replaced with&#13;
modified and new CTWs, the water supply would be maintained at present levels. This, along with&#13;
improvements in the surface system, would result in an increase in aggregate water supply in the project&#13;
Recent studies show that utilization of PTWs ranges from 4 to 13 percent indicating limitation to water distributioii fromil PTWs over&#13;
a wide area.&#13;
During critical periods the PTW owners apply water to their own farms before giving to others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
area by over 10 percent. The timeliness of water supplies would improve due to less reliance on the&#13;
public grid as well as O&amp;M system. The water quality would improve due to pumping from shallow&#13;
depths and better conjunctive use of surface and groundwater supplies, and reduced saline groundwater&#13;
intrusions.&#13;
Methodology of Project Impact Assessment&#13;
6.4           For the purpose of project impact analysis, it is assumed for the future base-case that after&#13;
closure of STWs the lost pumpage would be replaced with PTWs (future without project). Large farmers&#13;
would install PTWs. use water for themselves and sell water to small farmers. PTWs pumping costs are&#13;
much below the STWs but much highier thani the CTWs (Aniex 10, Table 2). It is further assumed that&#13;
there will not be any chanige in production due to transfer of STWs pumpage to PTWs or CTWs. The&#13;
project benefits arise from reduction in pumping cost with CTWs instead of PTWs, mainly due to better&#13;
utilization of the installations (future with project). In addition, the system improvements carried out in&#13;
fresh and saline areas would result in increased production mainly due to higher cropping intensities and&#13;
reduced pumnpage costs because of higher delivery efficiency (future with project and system&#13;
improvements). It is assumed that 75 percent of the farms in the project area would participate in the&#13;
project, or in other words 75 percent of the STWs pumpage would be replaced with CTWs, while farms&#13;
not participating may (or may not) replace pumpage by existing or new PTWs.  Surface system&#13;
improvements would take place in the areas/watercourses participating in the CTW program. Based on&#13;
the field experience, these assumptions are very conservative, hence the resulting benefits estimates may&#13;
be understated.&#13;
Impact on Production&#13;
6.5    Crop Yields.  Over the next ten years the crop yield in the project area would increase by about&#13;
five percent. It is assumed, however, that crop yields would be the same without or with STWs transfer&#13;
as well as with system improvement. (Annex I1, Table 2).&#13;
6.6    Cropping Intensities. Presently, average cropping intensities in different SCARP areas range&#13;
from 1 17 to 145 percent with small farms having a higher average intensity (about 140 percent) than the&#13;
large farms (121 percent). The same cropping intensity is assumed for future without or with transfer of&#13;
STWs. The cropping intensities would, however, increase by about 10 percent with surface system&#13;
improvement due to additional water availability from canals and tubewells resulting from improved&#13;
delivery efficiency (Annex 1 1, Table 3).&#13;
6.7    Cropping Patterns.   Major changes are not expected in the cropping patterns, except in areas&#13;
where surface systems are improved. In these areas, there would be a shift towards cotton and fruits in&#13;
Cotton-Wheat and Sugarcane-Wheat cropping systems, and towards Basmati, in Rice-Wheat systems.&#13;
6.8    Production.   Overall production in the future, without or with transfer of STWs, is assumed&#13;
to be the samc. However, production would increase in the systems improvement situation on the&#13;
participating farms. The increase in Basmati, Cotton, and Wheat is expected to be about 7,590, 12,770,&#13;
and 6,71 0 tons, respectively, on participating small farms and 15,150, 16,090, 4,650 tons on participating&#13;
large farms respectively (see Annex I 1, Table 5 for details).&#13;
B. Markets and Prices&#13;
6.9    Markets.      The project area, which covers some of the most productive agricultural areas in&#13;
the country, has a wetl developed transport network and there are a large number of rice, flour, sugar and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
cotton ginniniig mills as well as milk processing plants. The Provincial Food Departmenit and the Pakistan&#13;
Agricultural Supply and Services Corporation are involved in procuremenit of rice, wheat, cotton and&#13;
sugarcane. Farmers also have easy access to a number of major agricultural markets in large towins nearby&#13;
such as Lahore, Faisalabad, SheikIlupura, Multan and Sarghoda.  The relatively small increase in&#13;
productic n would be either consumed on-farm or easily sold.&#13;
6.10   Input Supply. 'Ilhe incremenltal requirements would be readily available throughi the norimial input&#13;
supply mechanism.  Similarly, no difficulty is anticipated in supplying the very limiited increased&#13;
requirements for planting materials and pesticides.&#13;
6.11   Prices. Prices for various agricultural goods are determined by domestic supply and demanld, as&#13;
well as by Government policies with regard to interniationial trade, and taxes and subsidies. Until the&#13;
early- I 980s, agricultural output prices were kept low in order to containi the cost of living, while fertilizers&#13;
were subsidized to promote greater use. Since theni, output prices have been raised althoughi they are&#13;
generally still below international levels. Also, fertilizer subsidies are being removed and have already&#13;
been eliminated in the case of urea. Farn budget analysis is based on prevailing market prices (Aninex&#13;
10, Table 1 ) which may inciease in the future as the Government continiues to more closely align domestic&#13;
and internationial prices.&#13;
C. Farm Income&#13;
Farm Models&#13;
6.12          Farm models were developed ftor the three prevalent production systems found in the&#13;
project area: the Cotton-Wheat system representative of SCARP Ill Rangpur Ullit; the Sugarcanie-Wlheat&#13;
system representative of SCARP V, and most of SCARP 11 and Shalipur; and the Rice-Wheat system&#13;
representative of SCARP IV. Withinl each production system, models were developed for small farmers&#13;
(2.5 ha) and large farmers ( 10 ha). The small farn models represent 80 percent of farmers with less than&#13;
6 ha, who farm about 50 percent of the land; while the large farm models represent 20 percent of farmers&#13;
with more than 6 ha have the remaining 50 percent of the land. Crop budgets of major crops in financial&#13;
prices and economic returns are given in Annex I1, Table 2. In line with the prevailing situation, larger&#13;
farmers would: have higher yields; use more fertilizer; have lower cropping intenisities and employ hired&#13;
labor; and use tractors rather thanl bullocks. The farm models have been used to analyze the impact of&#13;
CTWs alone, as well as in combination with improving the surface systemiis. They are suLmiiiarized in&#13;
Aniex  I Table 3 and Table 4.&#13;
Impact on Farm Incomes&#13;
6.13          With the transfer of STWs to CTWs the cost of water for participating small farms would&#13;
be reduced by 64 percent (from Rs. 2,650 to 970) hence their net income from crops would increase by&#13;
about 8 percent. The cost of water to participating large farms would reduce by 40 percent (from Rs.&#13;
634,000 to 387,000 ) and their net incomes would increase by about 4 percent.  With system&#13;
improvements, net incomes (from crops) of participating small and large farms would increase by 9 and&#13;
10 percent respectively. Since, both small and large farmers would benefit from the project. they would&#13;
participate in the CTWs program. The detailed results of' farm11 modlels arc sho%% n in Annex I. 'I ahles&#13;

VII. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. Benefits and Justification&#13;
Quantified Benefits&#13;
7. 1             As described in the preceding chapter (para 6.2 to 6.4), in the future without the project&#13;
the PTWs are expected to replace the pumpage of STWs as these become derelict. The project would&#13;
generate benefits through installation of CTWs which are a lower cost alternative to the operation of&#13;
PTWs (Annex 10, Table 2). Although there is a likelihood that agricultural production would decline&#13;
with the closure of STWs, the benefits due to avoiding this loss with the project have not been quantified.&#13;
However, the benefits due to increased agricultural production with watercourses and canals&#13;
improvements in fresh and saline groundwater areas have been quantified. The project benefit streams,&#13;
therefore, include: (a) the benefits due to reduction in pumping costs --CTWs instead of PTWs; and (b)&#13;
the benefits due to increased agricultural production from increased water supply with system&#13;
improvements in fresh and saline groundwater areas. The benefits due to reduction in waterlogging and&#13;
salinity with measures under the Prevention of Saline Groundwater Intrusion component, as well as with&#13;
the development of a groundwater regulatory framework, and benefits of pilot projects and training under&#13;
the Technical Assistance component are not included.&#13;
7.2              The analysis based on these conservative assumptions shows that the project would&#13;
generate substantial economic benefits in the short- and long-term. The cost of pumping groundwater&#13;
with STWs is about Rs. 685 million (pumping about 2.32 MAF of groundwater in June 1995 economic&#13;
prices). By closing the STWs and replacing the same pumpage with PTWs the cost of pumping would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
reduce by Rs. 114 million. With the project, assuming 75 percent participation in the CTW program,&#13;
the cost of pumping would reduce further by Rs. 174 million at full development. The returns to closing&#13;
the STWs are extremely high and even greater by replacing those with CTWs. With surface system&#13;
improvements, the value of production would increase by about Rs. 883.4 million (Annex 11, Table 6).&#13;
The project would directly benefit some 380,000 farm families, particularly the 80 percent with small&#13;
farms. On-farm employment would increase slightly, by about 3 percent in situations with CTWs only&#13;
and about 15 percent with CTWs and surface improvements.&#13;
Other Benefits&#13;
7.3            The project would also generate substantial environmental and other benefits. The high&#13;
capital investment required to set up PTWs and anarchic development of groundwater would be avoided.&#13;
The increased availability of electricity resulting from the shut down of STWs would also contribute to&#13;
overcoming some of the chronic electricity shortages in the country. It would encourage the participatory&#13;
irrigation management and development of FOs; and would lead to forming sustainable participation of&#13;
farmers at the higher level of the canal system. The introduction of groundwater regulations would&#13;
promote and guide private investments, and ensure environmentally sustainable exploitation of&#13;
groundwater. CTWs would improve the distribution of ground and surface water. Since CTWs are&#13;
easier to nmonitor and have self-regulating characteristics, costs of monitoring and regulation would be&#13;
lower. Finally, privatization of highly inefficient STWs would substantially reduce the O&amp;M burden on&#13;
the Government. This would allow to re-direct resources to improve O&amp;M of canals and drainage&#13;
systems, as well as increase investments in activities where the private sector cannot take a lead, such as&#13;
off-farm drainage, large canals and inter-river transfer facilities.&#13;
B. Economic Analysis&#13;
7.4            The economic viability of the project has been tested through estimation of an economic&#13;
rate of return (ERR).  The economic value of project benefits has been calculated by evaluating&#13;
incremental outputs and inputs at economic prices and, in the case of non-traded commodities, by using&#13;
a standard conversion factor (SCF) of 0.9 (Annex 10, Tables I and 2). Economic costs have been&#13;
calculated from total project costs, including physical contingencies, with the local cost component being&#13;
adjusted by the SCF and excluding taxes and duties.&#13;
7.5            The ERR for the CTWs component is estimated at 19 percent, for the surface&#13;
improvements component the ERR is 26 percent and for the overall project 24 percent (Annex 11, Tables&#13;
7),3  As explained above, the returns on the CTWs component are due to reduction in operating and&#13;
capital cost of CTWs compared with PTWs having low utilization rates. The returns on the surface&#13;
improvements, are due to increased water supply and improved conjunctive use of surface and&#13;
groundwater resulting in increased agricultural production.&#13;
C. Enviromnental Effects&#13;
7.6            The project would have a number of positive effects on the environment. It would control&#13;
waterlogging and the rising water table in that area. By promoting conjunctive use of surface and&#13;
groundwater, it would improve water quality and reduce risks of soil salinity. Lastly, it would help&#13;
control the intrusion of saline water into the fresh groundwater aquifer. The monitoring program&#13;
Benefit build up for STWs transfer is assumed to be 5. 25. 50. 85, 100 percent starting from year 2 of the project and&#13;
5,15,35.55,75.85 and 100 percent of full development starting from project year 3 for surface system improvements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
supported by the project and the development of a regulatory framework for province wide groundwater&#13;
use would be a major step towards sustainability of groundwater aquifers.&#13;
7.7            The effluent from drainage facilities to be rehabilitated under the project would not be&#13;
significant, and it would be disposed in the existing drainage systems. The detailed analysis carried out&#13;
under the Sectoral Environmental Assessment --National Drainage Program studies demonstrates that the&#13;
effluent quantity and quality disposed by the systems under consideration are far below the level that&#13;
could impact downstream  adversely. The impact of pollutants from diesel tubewells, as opposed to&#13;
electrical tubewells, would be insignificant because they would be scattered over a wide area.&#13;
7.8    Land Acquisition.    There are no on-going or anticipated future resettlemenit and rehabilitation&#13;
(R&amp;R) is-.ues related to project activities.&#13;
7.9    Program Objective Category.           The project would support IDA's poverty relief objective,&#13;
through ;ts impact on growth of income of small and marginal farmers, private sector development,&#13;
public sector management and environmental objectives.  Farmers' participation in the irrigation&#13;
management would be instituted by development of effective FOs, therefore, the project would advance&#13;
IDA's private sector development objectives as well. The public sector management objectives would&#13;
be met by rationalizing the public sector O&amp;M  expenditures. Lastly, it would support environmental&#13;
objectives by putting in place a moniitorinig program for groundwater aquifers, developing a regulatory&#13;
framework for their use, controlling the spread of saline aquifers, and improvinig the efficiency of usinig&#13;
the water resources.&#13;
D. Risks and Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
Project Risks&#13;
7.10           There are three main risks to the project. Firstly, lower participation by the farmers&#13;
lxcause: (a' farmers may prefer to have their own PTWs; (b) the public tubewells are a source of cheap&#13;
it rigation water for many farmers, who may, especially the influential ones, pressure the Government to&#13;
stop or delay their closure; and (c) the PID staff which is presently engaged in the O&amp;M of STWs would&#13;
become redundant with the divestment of public tubewells and may try to retard the project progress.&#13;
This risk would be minimized by: (a) launchiiig an extensive social mobilization program  for&#13;
demonstrating to the farmers the benefits of participatory irrigation management, and for developing&#13;
effective FOs; (b, providing incentives for installation of CTWs; and (c) assigning the responsibility of&#13;
privatization of tubewells to the PMU and by providing a training program and severance package for&#13;
redeployinent of PID staff. Participation in the CTWs is not mandatory, in fact it is a choice and a&#13;
superior sohluion for sustainable use of groundwater resources.&#13;
7.11           Secondly, there is risk of waterlogging and salinity in some areas when the operation of&#13;
public tubewells is stopped and replacement CTWs are not yet installed. This risks would only be in&#13;
limited project areas where water table is very shallow. This aspect would be minimized by careful&#13;
scheduling of the project activities especially the farmers support program.&#13;
7.12           The third risk relates to implementation of the investment program in a timely manner.&#13;
Apart from initial start-up delays, the GOPunjab demonstrated an improvement in the implementation of&#13;
water sector projects in the recent years. Punjab's pace for implementing Second Irrigation System&#13;
Rehabilitation Project (CR. 1 888-PAK) was considerably faster than other provinces. The implementation&#13;
of On-farm Water Management Program, consisting of small works jointly constructed by farmers and&#13;
the Government, is generally better than other projects with large civil works. Nevertheless, in order&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
to ensure timely completion, several start-up actions are being taken before project approval. PMU has&#13;
been established, the project implementation consultants have been selected, PC-I has been prepared,&#13;
recruitment of M&amp;E consultants is underway, and bid documents for procurement of vehicles and&#13;
equipment have been finalized. In addition to these actions, the review and coordination arrangements&#13;
proposed for the project and support to PMU for building of project MIS would minimize this risk.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
7. 13         The project ERR is very robust and not very sensitive to variations in project costs or&#13;
benefits. The sensitivity analysis, based on the above risks, shows that it is highly unlikely that&#13;
unfavorable developments would reduce the project ERR to opportunity cost of capital (OCC) --taken as&#13;
12 percent. Even if the participation is only half of the anticipated level (37 percent), ERR of CTW&#13;
component would be equal to OCC while overall project ERR would be about 17 percent (Annex II&#13;
Table 7b). The benefits from surface system improvements would have to fall by more than 60 percent&#13;
for ERR to decline to OCC. Alternately, ERR would be equal to OCC if costs increase by about 100&#13;
percent. ERR response to different combinations of changes in costs and benefits ranging from -50 to&#13;
50 percent is shown in Annex 11, Figure 1.  Annex 11, Figure 2 shows combinations of changes in&#13;
overall costs and benefits where ERR would switch from being acceptable to falling below the OCC. A&#13;
few points fi-om this curve are given in Table 7. 1. It shows that if costs uniformly increase by 20&#13;
percent, the project's performance would still be satisfactory as long as the reduction in benefits is less&#13;
than 40 percent. Delays of one or two years in realizing benefits are not expected to affect the project's&#13;
performance significantly.&#13;

VII. Agreements and Recommendations&#13;
8.1    Assurances have been obtained from GOP and GOPunjab as appropriate that:&#13;
(a)    GOPunjab would formally close all Governrment-owned irrigation tubewells by June 30,&#13;
1998. The GOPunjab would also: (i) eliminate the provincial program for subsidizing&#13;
individually owned private tubewells in areas supplied by canal water by September 30,&#13;
1996; and (ii) initiate a study for preparation of a plan to phase out subsidies to the&#13;
individually-owned private tubewells in areas not supplied by canal water and where&#13;
private tubewells are the sole source of irrigation water, and implement such plan by&#13;
December 31, 1997 (para 3.9);&#13;
(b)    GOPunjab would finalize the training program and severance packages by December 31,&#13;
1996 in consultation with the STWs staff. The GOPunjab would make provisions in its&#13;
operating budget for retirement/severance benefits (as appropriate) for the staff whose&#13;
employment would cease during the following fiscal year and ensure that such benefits&#13;
are madit available to the eligible staff. The staff receiving severance benefits would not&#13;
be re-hired by the Government within a period of seven years from the date they cease&#13;
to be employed by the Government (para 3.14);&#13;
(c)    proper specifications and design criteria would be observed for all civil works constructed&#13;
under the project and measures would be taken to control quality of construction&#13;
acceptable to IDA (para 3.33);&#13;
(d)    PMtI would furnish proposals for staff training under the project to IDA for its prior&#13;
review and approval (para 3.35);&#13;
(e)    project accounts including Special Account, would be maintained and audited annually&#13;
in accordance with sound auditing standards consistently applied by independent and&#13;
qualified auditors acceptable to IDA. The auditors would issue separate opinions on the&#13;
project accounts, disbursements from the special account, and SOEs and supporting&#13;
documents used as a basis for disbursements from the credit. PMU would provide&#13;
project accounts to its auditors unaudited within three months after each fiscal year (by&#13;
September 30), and would submit an audited report of project accounts to IDA within six&#13;
imonths (December 31) (para 4. 10);&#13;
(f)    the PMU, PPC and PCC would be maintained with composition and TOR acceptable to&#13;
IDA until the project completion (para 5.1);&#13;
(g)    by March 31 each year, the PMU would submit to IDA for its review and approval, a&#13;
draft Annual Plan, including work program and the proposed budgetary allocation for the&#13;
following fiscal year (para 5.18);&#13;
(h)    the PMU would prepare a mid-term review report by December 31, 1998 and detailed&#13;
mid-termii review (MTR) would be carried out jointly by GOPunjab, GOP and IDA by&#13;
March 31. 1999 (para 5.21);&#13;
(i)    GOPunjab will discuss with IDA by February, 15 of each fiscal year the level of funding&#13;
required for operation and maintenance of the irrigation and drainage systems in Punjab&#13;
for the following fiscal year, and based on mutually agreed funding levels, provide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
adequate budgetary allocations (para 5.22);&#13;
(j)    GOPunjab would initiate implementation of pilot projects for decentralizing management&#13;
at the canal command level and enhancing beneficiaries participation in the O&amp;M of the&#13;
system at distributary/minor level. To this end, the GOPunjab would appraise first pilot&#13;
project during fiscal year 1996-97 and start its implementation by July 1, 1998 (5.23);&#13;
(k)    for recovery of capital cost of works constructed under the project the following recovery&#13;
plan would be implemented. For each SCARP tubewell transferred to the farmers as&#13;
such for operation as CTW, the Government would charge Rs. 10,000. For CTWs&#13;
installed by modifying a SCARP tubewell, the Government would provide one time&#13;
financial assistance of Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 30,000 for installation of a new CTW, while&#13;
the remaining costs would be borne by the FOs. For watercourse improvement, FOs&#13;
would contribute skilled (masons) and unskilled labor and 30 percent of the materials cost&#13;
up-front. In addition, FOs would pay back 45 percent of material costs in 6 installments&#13;
over a three-year period. Similarly, for canal lining, farmers would pay 5 percent of the&#13;
cost up-front and another 50 percent in installments over a period of eight years (para&#13;
5.25); and&#13;
(l)    the Planiing and Development Board would hire, independently of the PMU, services&#13;
of specialists in various fields to carry out detailed supervision of the project on behalf&#13;
of GOPunjab from time to time (on average two times a year) and submit detailed&#13;
supervision reports (para 5.19).&#13;
8.2    Condition of Effectiveness.   Following would be conditions of effectiveness:&#13;
(a)    full approval by the Executive Committee of the National Economic Council (ECNEC)&#13;
of the project's Planning Commission Form No. 1 (PC-l) and sanctioning of project&#13;
expenditures would be a condition of credit effectiveness (para 4.3);&#13;
(b)    the project implementation consultants are duly employed and are on location and ready&#13;
to commence operations (para 3.36); and&#13;
(c)    recruitment of full time core staff for the PMU (full time Project Director, Directors and&#13;
Support staff)(para 5.15);&#13;
8.3           With the above assurances and conditions, the project would be suitable for an IDA credit&#13;
of SDR 38.5 million (US$56.0 million equivalent) on standard terms with a 35 year maturity. The&#13;
Borrower would be the Islamic Republic of Pakistan&#13;

O'      Calculated using CROPWAT.&#13;
Irrigation Requirement at watercourse head are estimated using 57 percent delivery and application efficiency.&#13;
d:r     The reported SCARP Tube-Well (STW) water supply is from log-book data, while estimated is based on utilization&#13;
rates collected by the SCARP Monitoring Organization (SMO) of WAPDA.&#13;
e/      Surface water supply plus estimated STW water supply plus PTW water supply&#13;
fV      Assumed that pumpage would be the same after transfer of STWs as in the present situation.&#13;
g/      Assumed that large farmers would increase pumpage from Private Tube-Wells (PTWs) to replace water supply lost&#13;
due to clo-;ure of STWs.&#13;

Terms of Reference&#13;
For&#13;
Project Implementation Assistance Consultants&#13;
1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.            The Government of Pakistan (GOP) has requested the International Development&#13;
Association (IDA) for a Credit to meet part of the cost of the proposed Punjab Private Sector Groundwater&#13;
Development. The project is being implemented by the Government of Punjab (GOPunjab). A Project&#13;
Management Unit (PMU) in the Planning &amp; Development Board of GOPunjab is responsible for overall&#13;
project management and coordination. The Punjab Irrigation Department (PID) and the Directorate&#13;
General of Water Management (OFWM) in the Agricultural Departments are the co-implementing&#13;
agencies. These terms of reference are for consultancy services in various fields for providing&#13;
implementation assistance to the PMU, PID, and OFWM.&#13;
2.     Project Objectives.   The overall objectives of the PGWD Project are to increase the scope and&#13;
productivity of Punjab's irrigation and drainage subsector and increase farmer's incomes. Its specific&#13;
objectives are to: (a) redefine govemment's role in groundwater development with a greater role for the&#13;
private sector; (b) develop a regulatory framework and a monitoring program to ensure sustainable use&#13;
of the groundwater resources; (c) develop sustainable farmers organizations (FOs) which can efficiently&#13;
operate and maintain groundwater irrigation, improve surface irrigation, and establish a base for&#13;
participation in the management of the canal systems; (d) rationalize public expenditure on O&amp;M of the&#13;
irrigation and drainage systems as well as increase the recovery of public expenditures on irrigation&#13;
infrastructure; and (e) avoid environmental hazard of saline water intrusion into fresh groundwater&#13;
aquifers.&#13;
3.     Project Description.  The proposed five-year (FY97-2001) project would cover the fresh&#13;
groundwater areas (FGW) of SCARP 11 (including Shahpur), SCARP III (Rangpur Unit), SCARP IV and&#13;
SCARP V (Shorkot Kamnalia) located in administrative divisions of Sargodha, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, and&#13;
Lahore. It also includes saline groundwater (SGWs) areas within or at the boundaries of FGW areas. The&#13;
gross area is about 1.455 million ha of which about 1.193 million ha have FGW, while the CCA is about&#13;
1.292 million hectares of which about 1.068 million hectares have FGW. The major project components&#13;
are: (a) privatization of SCARP tubewells (STWs); (b) development of groundwater monitoring and&#13;
regulatory framework; (c) improvement of irrigation facilities in fresh groundwater areas, including&#13;
improvement of watercourses and lining of minor canals; (d) prevention of saline groundwater intrusion&#13;
into fresh aquifers, including rehabilitation of drainage tubewells, and lining of watercourses in saline&#13;
groundwater areas; (e) monitoring and evaluation; (f) technical assistance and training; (g) project&#13;
management and supervision.&#13;

II. SCOPE OF CONSULTING SERVICES&#13;
4.            The project requires multi-/interdisciplinary consultancy services in the following four&#13;
categories:&#13;
A.    Project management support;&#13;
B.    Community mobilization and formation of farmer organizations (FOs) for privatizing&#13;
STWs, and promoting farmer participation in canal lining;&#13;
C.    Engineering services for surveys, design and construction supervision of civil works (canal&#13;
lining, watercourse improvement, and rehabilitation of drainage tubewells), including role&#13;
of the "Engineer" in contract management; and&#13;
D.    Preparation of groundwater regulatory framework.&#13;
A. Project Management Support&#13;
5.            This includes assistance to the Project Director (PD) PMU and other core staff of the PMU&#13;
for, inter alia: (i) procurement planning and processing and ensuring compliance with IDA procurement&#13;
guidelines at all stages (receipt of bids, evaluation and award of contracts); (ii) maintenance of&#13;
consolidated project accounts and arranging for timely annual audits; (iii) preparation of consolidated&#13;
annual work plans for all project components; (iv) preparation of annual budgetary requests; (v)&#13;
establishment of an MIS, and preparation of periodic progress reports and project implementation&#13;
completion report; (vi) preparation and implementation of training programs; and (vii) preparation of&#13;
project supervision plans for the P&amp;D Board. These services would be provided by the Project Manager&#13;
of the consultants with inputs of MIS and Accounting and Financial Management Specialists and&#13;
support staff. Total input is estimated at 60 staff months (SMs).&#13;
B. Community Mobilization for Divestment of SCARP tubewells and Canal Lining&#13;
6.       The proposed project will privatize approximately 4,200 SCARP tubewells (STWs)'. The&#13;
project will support the formation of FOs, and, through them, the establishment of privately operated&#13;
community tubewells (CTWs) to replace govemment-operated STWs throughout the project area. The&#13;
objective of this project activity is to develop FOs that can efficiently operate and maintain surface and&#13;
groundwater resources for irrigated agriculture in Punjab on a sustainable basis. To achieve this objective,&#13;
the project will support the development of a social mobilization program within the Project Management&#13;
Unit (PMU). The PMU will have overall responsibility for the project's social mobilization efforts&#13;
through a Community Development Support Group (CDSG) recruited as consultancy services. The CDSG&#13;
team will consist of: (a) core staff responsible for CDSG field staff training and management, and social&#13;
mobilization program coordination; and (b) field staff of Social Organizers (SOs) working with the help&#13;
of NGOs and village level social activists to mobilize farmer participation in project activities. CDSG will&#13;
have responsibility for the privatization of approximately 2,700, or two-thirds of the STWs targeted for&#13;
privatization. The CDSG will also be responsible for assisting the PID in promoting farmer&#13;
participation in canal lining, and watch and ward as well as operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of&#13;
Of which 2,458 STWs are located in SCARPs II and Shahpur, 1,001 in SCARP IV, 570 in SCARP III (Rangpur unit), and 101 in&#13;
SCARP V.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

drainage tubewell rehabilitated under the project. The Directorate of OFWM will be responsible for&#13;
privatizing the remaining 1,500 STWs in conjunction with a program of project-supported watercourse&#13;
improvement. The PMU will have the overall responsibility for coordination and supervision of all STW&#13;
privatization and FO development activities supported by the project, including those undertaken by&#13;
OFWM.&#13;
7.            The CDSG will report to the PD PMU through the Director (Project Management and&#13;
Community Development) of the PMU. It will comprise of international and national consultants and&#13;
provide management, technical and implementation services in support of the project's social mobilization&#13;
program. The consultancy team will undertake two interrelated activities: (a) to assist the PMU in the&#13;
management and coordination of the project's social mobilization efforts, including the training and&#13;
supervision of field-level technical and support staff, and coordination of field activities with those of&#13;
OFWM; and (b) to mobilize farmer participation in the privatization of STWs, and in the improved&#13;
management of surface and groundwater resources. The CDSG will also be responsible for engaging local&#13;
Non Governmental Organizations (NGOs) for mobilizing farmer participation in the project.&#13;
8.     Management, Coordination and Training Activities.         A core group of consultants within&#13;
the CDSG will provide management, coordination and training services for the social mobilization&#13;
program of the project. This core group will:&#13;
a.     develop and field test a standardized model for the formation of FOs, and ensure its&#13;
adoption by all agencies involved in the project's social mobilization efforts (i.e.,&#13;
consultants, NGOs and OFWM)2;&#13;
b.     develop and implement a comprehensive training program  for all social&#13;
mobilization field staff in the principles of participatory community development,&#13;
and in appropriate methods for mobilizing farmer participation in FOs;&#13;
c.     design and supervise Watercourse Assessment Surveys to be carried out over the entire&#13;
project area to collect baseline data on socio-economic, agronomic, hydrological and&#13;
infrastructure conditions prevailing in the watercourse CCA served by each STW targeted&#13;
for transition;&#13;
d.     prepare coordinated and detailed annual work plans for the deployment of CDSG field&#13;
staff throughout the project area, and the achievement of STW transition and FO&#13;
formation targets;&#13;
e.     provide regular supervision to all CDSG field staff during the initial phases of project&#13;
implementation, and provide on-going guidance to the project's supervisory Social&#13;
Coordinators in the management of the field personnel under their supervision;&#13;
f.    in coordination with the PMU, develop standardized project monitoring and evaluation&#13;
procedures and general reporting formats for documenting project performance;&#13;
g.     develop a set of criteria for the monitoring and evaluation of project impact in building&#13;
sustainable FOs that can be integrated into the overall project MIS.&#13;
2   The model developed under the Second SCARP Transition Project would be used as a starting point and further refinements&#13;
would be made.&#13;

9.     Social Mobilization Activities.    The main objective of these activities is to establish viable&#13;
FOs that would install and subsequently operate and maintain CTWs. FOs would have the option to: (i)&#13;
takeover the SCARP tubewells as such and operate them as community tubewell (CTWs); (ii) modify&#13;
STWs and run them as CTW; (iii) install new CTWs; or (iv) replace the STWs' pumpage with existing&#13;
or new private tubewells (PTWs). The project would provide one time financial assistance of Rs. 20,000&#13;
for modified and new CTWs only. This amount represents approximately 30 percent of the capital cost&#13;
of a new CTW. The remaining cost will be borne by the FO membership. For the transferred STWs the&#13;
FOs would be charged Rs. 10,000 per STW. The project would support installation of one to two CTWs&#13;
on each watercourse (W/C), with a maximum of four CTWs per STWs (only for those STWs that serve&#13;
more than one watercourse). The discharge capacities of CTWs would range from 1-2 cusecs (average&#13;
1.5 cusecs). The project would have built in safeguards to ensure that the total capacity of CTWs, and&#13;
existing and new PTWs, does not exceed the present operational capacity of the STWs. The CTWs would&#13;
be located along the communal watercourse, on public land or on the land purchased/leased by the FOs.&#13;
The CDSG will undertake the following activities:&#13;
a.     carry out Watercourse Assessment Surveys in the entire project area, and make&#13;
recommendations to the PMU regarding the location and scheduling of project&#13;
implementation activities;&#13;
b.     deploy trained Social Organizers throughout the project area to mobilize farmer support&#13;
for the STW privatization and canal lining, and assist farmers in forming viable FOs and&#13;
installing CTWs;&#13;
c.     provide follow-on "after-care" services to FOs to ensure organizational sustainability. and&#13;
provide technical assistance in tubewell operation and maintenance, improved water&#13;
management and improved agronomic practices;&#13;
d.     coordinate and provide management supervision of all social mobilization activities&#13;
implemented as sub-projects by NGOs;&#13;
e.     provide regular progress reports on STW transition and FO formation efforts to the PMU.&#13;
10.    Organization and Composition of CDSG.   Theconsultantscore staffwould consistof aTeam&#13;
Leader3, a Social Mobilization Specialist and a Training Specialist. The core consultants will be based&#13;
in Lahore and housed in the offices of the PMU. In addition field offices of the CDSG will be established&#13;
at Mandi Bahauddin and Sargodha to serve the SCARP 11 and Shahpur areas, at Garh Maharajah to serve&#13;
SCARP III (Rangpur Unit) and SCARP V (Shorkot Kamalia), and at Sharqpur for the SCARP IV area.&#13;
Other core staff will comprise a Field Operations Management team, based in Lahore, four Watercourse&#13;
Assessment Survey Teams, and four social mobilization field teams whose size will be expanded as project&#13;
activities increase in geographical scope. In addition to support staff, each field team will typically&#13;
include: one Social Coordinator (SC), with responsibilities for managing the field office; Technical&#13;
Coordinators (TCs); Social Organizers (SOs), After-care Social Organizers (ASOs), and a Watercourse&#13;
Assessment Survey Team.&#13;
A   The Project Manager of the consultants team will also perform the functions of the CDSG teamn leader.&#13;

12.    Consultants Field Staff&#13;
a.     Social Coordinators (SCs).   Four SCs are required to train, manage and supervise ten&#13;
SOs and five ASOs each. Each SC will be responsible for the day-to-day operation of&#13;
his/her CDSG field office, and report directly to the Field Operations Manager. The SCs&#13;
will be expected to commence the social mobilization activities of each field office and&#13;
gradually turn over the work to the SOs/ASOs under his supervision. The SCs will also&#13;
work closely with project management to establish and maintain a system for monitoring&#13;
the performance of social mobilization field staff. SCs should hold an Masters degree in&#13;
Rural Sociology, or related disciplines, and have three-five years of progressively&#13;
responsible experience in rural development projects in Pakistan, preferably in Punjab.&#13;
Experience with the supervision of junior professionals and familiarity with ongoing&#13;
participatory community development projects in Pakistan, such as the ongoing Second&#13;
SCARP Transition Project, the Agha Khan Rural Support Project, and the Mansehra&#13;
Village Support Program, is highly desirable.&#13;
b.     Technical Coordinators (TCs).      TCs are required to provide technical guidance to&#13;
SOs, ASOs and directly to FOs in the selection of tubewell technology, the efficient&#13;
management of water resources and the introduction of improved agronomic practices.&#13;
A senior Irrigation Engineer (4) with knowledge of tubewell technology, and a senior&#13;
Agronomist or Agricultural Extension Specialist (4) will be assigned to each of the CDSG&#13;
field teams. Each TC should hold an advanced degree in his/her respective discipline and&#13;
have a minimum of five years experience in rural development projects in Punjab.&#13;
c.     Social Organizers (SOs).    SOs are required to mobilize farmer participation in STW&#13;
privatization. SOs will be responsible for the day-to-day support of FOs in every phase&#13;
of their formation from their organization and registration to the installation and operation&#13;
of their CTWs. SOs should hold a Masters degree in Rural Sociology, or related&#13;
disciplines, and have a minimum of two years community organization experience&#13;
working with villagers in Punjab. Alternatively, five years community organization&#13;
experience may be considered in lieu of the requirement for an advanced academic&#13;
degree. SOs must be fluent in local languages, highly motivated, willing to work and live&#13;
under difficult physical conditions, and be capable of interacting effectively with farmers&#13;
and government officials from various departments.&#13;
d.     After-care Social Organizers (ASOs).      ASOs are required to support the ongoing&#13;
activities of each FO once it has installed a CTW. One ASO will provide support to two&#13;
SOs in the formation of FOs. However, the primary responsibilities of the ASO will be&#13;
to monitor the performance of each FO according to the conditions of its formation,&#13;
provide guidance to FO membership in the maintenance of records and management of&#13;
its financial resources, and provide technical support to farmers willing to adopt improved&#13;
water management and agronomic practices. ASOs should hold a Masters degree in&#13;
Agronomy or Agricultural Extension and have a minimum of two years experience&#13;
working in agricultural development in Punjab. Like the SOs, ASOs must be fluent in&#13;
local languages, highly motivated, willing to work and live under difficult physical&#13;
conditions and capable of interacting effectively with farmers and government officials&#13;
from various departments.&#13;

e.     Watercourse Assessment Survey Teams.    The survey teams will conduct a baseline&#13;
survey of the watercourse of each STW targeted for transition under the project. One&#13;
team will be attached to each CDSG field office under the supervision of the senior&#13;
Irrigation Engineer/Technical Coordinator. A field office SO will accompany the team&#13;
and participate in the survey of each watercourse for which that SO will be responsible.&#13;
The survey team will be composed of a qualified Irrigation Engineers, an Agricultural&#13;
Economist and two Surveyors. Draftsmen attached to each CDSG field office will&#13;
prepare detailed maps of each targeted watercourse to be used in the planning and&#13;
monitoring of social mobilization activities.&#13;
13.          The deployment of field staff will be staggered throughout an individual cluster. An SO&#13;
or ASO will participate in each Watercourse Assessment Survey conducted in his/her cluster and return&#13;
to previously surveyed watercourses to promote FO formation or service existing FOs on a regular basis.&#13;
TCs will be called upon to support FOs at any point in the transition or post-transition process.  This&#13;
process will continue until the transition stage in all targeted watercourses in a cluster has been completed,&#13;
at which point the SO will move on to his/her next designated cluster to continue the process.&#13;
14.           Field staff capacity and farmer receptivity will both factor significantly in the timing and&#13;
success of CDSG field operations. The size and deployment of field staff will also be influenced by the&#13;
extent to which NGOs are engaged in field implementation of CDSG social mobilization activities. For&#13;
these reasons, the CDSG's overall field staff requirement presented below is intended to be indicative of&#13;
the range of services required. The shortlisted Consultants are encouraged to suggest alternative staffing&#13;
and field implementation strategies to maximize project resources and accelerate the achievement of&#13;
project targets.&#13;

D. Preparation of Groundwater Regulatory Framework&#13;
20.          In Punjab, groundwater extractions have been increasing consistently over the last two&#13;
decades. As a result, the water tables are falling in some of the fresh groundwater areas. This is a matter&#13;
of considerable concern. Over exploitation threatens the quality of the resource --lower level aquifers are&#13;
generally more saline, and significant differences of groundwater levels between fresh and saline areas&#13;
induce intrusion of saline water.  As the rate of use of groundwater is approaching its potential&#13;
availability, determination of groundwater rights (at individual and community level) and regulation of&#13;
its use, is essential for sustainable and equitable use of this common resource. The project would support&#13;
the development and implementation of a regulatory framework. It would strengthen capacity for&#13;
intensive monitoring in critical areas, develop capacity for determining safe yields of aquifers and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-78-                                           Annex 3&#13;

allocation of groundwater rights, as well as development and support for the institutional setup for&#13;
implementing groundwater regulations in critical areas.&#13;
21.            Currently, the SCARPs Monitoring Organization (SMO) of WAPDA  monitors the&#13;
groundwater aquifers especially in the SCARP areas. SMO's capacity for country wide monitoring would&#13;
be strengthened under the National Drainage Program.  The proposed project would strengthen&#13;
GOPunjab's capacity for intensive monitoring of the areas identified as critical for groundwater control&#13;
on the basis of SMO's general monitoring results. In addition to groundwater monitoring database,&#13;
simulation models would be employed in determining the safe yield of aquifers and its allocation by&#13;
distributary, watercourse and individual users.  Detailed rules for control and licensing as well as&#13;
methodology and institutional setup would be developed. The development work would be completed in&#13;
first three years of the project while the institutional setup for enforcement of regulation in critical areas&#13;
would be put in place during the remaining two years.&#13;
22.    Scope of Work.        The program of developing regulations and their implementation would&#13;
consist of three phases; (i) in the first phase, the groundwater management areas will be established based&#13;
on the existhig inforination ; (ii) in the second phase, critical areas for groundwater management would&#13;
be identified, detailed data collection and monitoring would be carried out in the critical areas, and safe&#13;
yields of aquifers and groundwater rights would be determined; and (iii) in the third phase, a procedure&#13;
for regulating the groundwater use in each critical area, and institutional arrangemiients would be&#13;
developed.&#13;
23.    Establishment of Management Areas.           The consultants will complete the following tasks&#13;
wvithin tde first year of their assignment:&#13;
a.     For ease in management of the groundwater basins, classify aquifers in Punjab in different&#13;
Groundwater Management areas, based on existing data, and considerinig behavior and&#13;
quality of aquifers, hydrological and meteorological data, topographic and geological&#13;
information, canal command areas, surface water application, efficiency of use, and&#13;
cropping patterns, etc.;&#13;
b.     Develop a database consisting of basic information for each managemenit area and update&#13;
it on a continuous basis; and&#13;
c.     Identify in each management area the sources of major aquifer recharge as well as&#13;
extractions.&#13;
24.    Identification of Critical Areas and Establishment of Groundwater Rights.         This shall&#13;
involve the following tasks which would be completed during the second year of the project:&#13;
a.     In parallel to establishing the Groundwater Management areas, identify critical areas&#13;
requiring extensive management;&#13;
h.     Develop and calibrate Groundwater models to simulate the groundwater behavior over a&#13;
long period including wet and dry cycles;&#13;
c.     carry out detailed data collection for calibration of the model, and develop a database for&#13;
eventual regulation of groundwater use for the critical areas; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 11 of 12&#13;
d.    Using the simulation models and monitoring information, develop proposals for&#13;
establishing rights to the groundwater by distributary command area, watercourse&#13;
command (chak) and by farm.&#13;
25.   Development of Procedures for Regulation and Institutional Structure. The following tasks&#13;
would be completed during the third year of the project.&#13;
a.    Based on the safe yields of the aquifer in the long run (considering wet and dry cycles),&#13;
pattern of groundwater water use in the critical areas, utilization rates of private,&#13;
community and public tubewells, estimates safe installed capacity by watercourse&#13;
command, as well as by distributaries. (For foreseeable future the regulation will be&#13;
based on the installed capacity of the tubewells which will be correlated to the actual&#13;
groundwater extractions through empirical studies and simulation models);&#13;
b.    develop proposals for a program for licensing the groundwater tubewells with an objective&#13;
towards achieving safe installed capacity. (In issuing the tubewell licenses preference will&#13;
be give to community tubewells supplying to several users in any chak);&#13;
c.    develop proposals for detailed institutional setups for groundwater management in each&#13;
management area, according to the type and the severity of the problem;&#13;
d.    implement pilots to test and evolve effective methods of groundwater monitoring and&#13;
regulation, roles of local and regulating institutions, farmers and their organizations, and&#13;
NGOs before refining the regulation procedures; and&#13;
e.    develop proposals for any new  legislation that may be required for facilitating&#13;
implementation of the regulatory framework.&#13;
26.   Estimate of Consultants' Inputs.    The following inputs would be required:&#13;

PAKISTAN&#13;
Punjab Private Sector Groundwater Development Project&#13;
Farmer Participation Plan&#13;
I1.            A growing body of evidence indicates that the privatization of public tubewells supplying&#13;
irrigation water provides farmers with better control over the joint use of surface and groundwater&#13;
resources. Improved control over these resources results in improved irrigation efficiencies and increased&#13;
agricultural productivity.4 When privatization strategies are designed to promote the organization of&#13;
farmers for the joint-ownership of pump irrigation schemes, improvements in the equity of irrigation water&#13;
distribution are more or less guaranteed. Joint-ownership leads to better management of both surface and&#13;
sub-surface water resources, establishes a foundation for the regulation of groundwater extraction (through&#13;
cooperative management) and sets the precedent , through the strengthening of participatory management&#13;
processes, for greater farmer involvement in increasingly more complex levels of resource management....&#13;
2.              The proposed project would transfer the ownership of approximately 4,200 public&#13;
tubewells -- installed in the 1960s and 1970s under successive Salinization Control and Reclamation&#13;
Projects (SCARPs) -- to farmer groups in four SCARP regions of Punjab Province. The project will&#13;
support the formation of approximately 6,300 Farmer Organizations (FOs) and their development of&#13;
privately operated community tubewells (CTWs) to replace govemment-operated SCARP tubewells&#13;
(STWs) throughout the project area. The objective of the project's farmer participation plan is to develop&#13;
FOs that can efficiently operate and maintain surface and groundwater resources for irrigated agriculture&#13;
in Punjab on a sustainable basis.&#13;
3.              Central to the success of public tubewell (STW) privatization would be the project's&#13;
promotion of farmer participation in the development and management of private groundwater extraction,&#13;
i.e., in the collective investment in community tubewells, the operation and maintenance of those&#13;
tubewells, and the effective and sustainable use of groundwater resources in conjunction with surface water&#13;
supplies. The encouragement of CTW  development is necessary to ensure that all farmers retain access&#13;
to sufficient supplies of groundwater to augment surface supplies when STWs are taken out of operation.&#13;
In addition, the project's successful promotion of CTW operation would to enhance the equity of water&#13;
resource distribution by improving water supplies to farmers with small land holdings at the tailend of&#13;
the tertiary conveyance systems.&#13;
4.              There has been a proliferation of private tubewell development in Punjab over the last two&#13;
decades.5    However, the costs of tubewell installation, and the marginal return on the investment in&#13;

The use of groundwater in agriculture in Pakistan was almost nil in 1960. Today, groundwater provides an&#13;
estimated 40 percent of the water reaching farmer's fields. Besides increasing the total amount of water available to&#13;
farmers for irrigation purposes, private wells have also eliminated much of the uncertainty associated with the&#13;
timing and volume of public irrigation supplies. See Robert Johnson. Factors Determining Groundwater Usefor&#13;
Irrigation in Pakistan's Punjab. Report prepared for the United States Agency for Intemational Development by&#13;

terms of crop yields on small landholdings, discourages the majority of farmers in Punjab from risking&#13;
the investment.6 In addition, while there is a well established system for the sharing of perennial surface&#13;
irrigation water (warabandi), Pakistani farmers have limited experience with the collective management&#13;
of groundwater extraction to augment surface supplies. Although there is evidence of informal "joint&#13;
ownership" and operation of small tubewells by farm families throughout Punjab, wide inequities in&#13;
patterns of land ownership, fragmentation of landholdings, particularly those of small landholders, a&#13;
relatively hierarchical social structure, the heterogeneity of many farming communities, and traditional&#13;
rivalries among, and between, lineages discourage widespread collaboration in capital investment to&#13;
improve agricultural production.&#13;
5.              The promotion of sustainable FOs and their operation of CTWs will require an intensive&#13;
institutional development effort. Evaluation of past and disappointing experiences in the promotion of&#13;
Water Users Associations for the improvement and maintenance of surface water conveyance systems in&#13;
Pakistan indicates that: (i) beneficiaries were not given sufficient autonomy in the planning, participation&#13;
and management of the watercourse improvements; (ii) the implementing agencies lacked the required&#13;
skills to build effective Associations; (iii) the amount of resources required to support sustainable&#13;
Associations, particularly in terms of institution building and follow-up visits by field staff, were vastly&#13;
underestimated; and (iv) incentives for farmer participation in the Associations were short-lived. The&#13;
farmer participation plan proposed for the Punjab Private Sector Groundwater Development Project takes&#13;
stock of this experience and incorporates the lessons learned into a new strategy for the development of&#13;
FOs. The approach is being tested under the on-going Second SCARP Transition Project in which 230&#13;
STWs were earmarked for transfer to FOs promoted through a recently developed farmer participation&#13;
program. The farmers' response has been good, nearly 800 FOs had been established and about 550&#13;
CTWs have been installed.&#13;
6.              Participatory approaches are gaining increased acceptance in donor-supported development&#13;
efforts as an effective means of promoting the sustainability of project benefits. However, participatory&#13;
approaches are not without their costs in terms of the time and effort required to recruit and train field&#13;
staff, to mobilize farmer support, and to carry out the socioeconomic research essential for effective&#13;
project implementation, monitoring and evaluation. Nevertheless, experience has demonstrated that these&#13;
additional costs are usually offset by subsequent improvements in the pace and quality of project&#13;
implementation, improved cost recovery rates, and sustainable systems of infrastructure operation and&#13;
maintenance.&#13;
7.              The proposed project will require a high level of staff resources over the five year life of&#13;
the project for the successful implementation of the farner participation plan. To place this level of&#13;
resource requirement in context, the following sections review the rational for farmer participation in the&#13;
irrigation sector, the experience of participatory approaches developed in Pakistan; the development of that&#13;
experience as it has been applied to the Second SCARP Transition Project; and the use to which the&#13;
lessons learned have been used to refine the farmer participation plan proposed for the Private Sector&#13;
Groundwater Development Project.&#13;
Based on data from the 1980 Agricultural Census, the average farrn size in the project area has been estimated at&#13;
4.4 hectares. Analysis of this data indicates that approximately 80 percent of all farms in the project area are&#13;
smaller than six hectares, while only ten percent are larger than ten hectares. Farms of less than six hectares&#13;
account for approximately 50 percent of the cultivated land area. The remaining 20 percent of farms account for&#13;
the remaining 50 percent of the land area. Landholdings are typically fragmented (especially in northeast and&#13;
central Punjab SCARP areas), with farmers cultivating an average of three non-contiguous plots. Average&#13;
household size is estimated at 7 persons. Considerable caution must be used in the use of the Agricultural Census&#13;
data which often disguise the failure of successive land reforms to break up the extensive landholdings.&#13;

Rationale for a Participatory Approach&#13;
8.             Community participation in rural development involves beneficiaries in the identification,&#13;
design, financing and implementation of their own development projects. Community participation&#13;
directly supports projects suited to the needs and abilities of the people whom the projects are intended&#13;
to benefit. In contrast, conventional approaches involving donor-to-government development grant or loan&#13;
assistance typically seek to strengthen the capacity of host-country institutions to deliver assistance.&#13;
Conventional projects are typically identified by outsiders (project managers, government officials,&#13;
technical experts) or project committees made up of local notables who represent their community to&#13;
outsiders. Neither of these groups is bound by community preference in the selection of projects. As a&#13;
result, conventional projects often fall short of providing the intended benefits to the community. Not&#13;
surprisingly, there is little incentive for the community to support or participate in a project that it did not&#13;
request and that may not serve its needs.&#13;
9.             The impact of participatory approaches has been particularly well documented in the&#13;
irrigation sector.7 Since the 1950s, large amounts of money have been invested to improve irrigated&#13;
agriculture worldwide. While initial investments in infrastructure contributed to a significant expansion&#13;
of food production, a growing share of investments in the irrigation sector over the past 20 years have&#13;
been targeted for the rehabilitation of irrigation infrastructure that the governments and water users have&#13;
failed to maintain. With fiscal crises in most developing countries, weaknesses of government delivery&#13;
of water services have become apparent. The deterioration of irrigation systems throughout the world has&#13;
exposed serious institutional deficiencies and resulting government failures in most water resources&#13;
agencies. This includes lack of motivation and accountability of agency staff, high levels of political&#13;
interference and rent seeking, as well as inadequate concern for needs of users. Consequently, without&#13;
reliable service, users are not willing to share in the investment, operation and maintenance costs.&#13;
Reliance on overextended government agencies that have neglected financial accountability, user&#13;
participation, and charging while not delivering services effectively to the users and particularly to the&#13;
poor is a major concern. The Bank's review of twenty-one irrigation projects found meaningful cost&#13;
recovery only in those projects in which water management and O&amp;M had been entrusted to water users.&#13;
10.            Because of their limited financial and administrative resources, governments need to be&#13;
selective in the responsibility they assume for water resources. An operational principle is that nothing&#13;
should be done at a higher level of government that can be done satisfactorily at a lower level. Thus,&#13;
where local or private capabilities exist the water delivery service should be transferred to private sector,&#13;
financially autonomous public corporations, and to community organizations. The lessons of experience&#13;
suggest that an important principle in restructuring public service agencies is their conversion into&#13;
financially autonomous entities, with effective authority to charge and collect fees and with freedom to&#13;
manage without political interference. Such entities need to work under hard budget constraint that&#13;
enhances incentives for efficiency and revenue generation.  Participation empowers stakeholder to&#13;
influence the formulation of policy, the choice of design and investment, an management decision&#13;
affecting their communities. It establishes necessary sense of ownership, bringing user discipline, and&#13;

accountability for service delivery. This would not only reduce public expenditures but ensure better&#13;
O&amp;M by making water users responsible for the facilities from which they benefitted.8&#13;
11.              User participation in irrigation management is not new. Communal irrigation systems have&#13;
existed in other countries, such as Thailand, India, Sri Lanka, Bali, Indonesia, the Philippines, Nepal,&#13;
Mexico, Argentina, Columbia, and the Dominican Republic. Experience indicates that active farmer&#13;
involvement in irrigation is very cost effective in mobilization of local resources, improvement and&#13;
maintenance activities, reduction of irrigation department staff time, reduction in the destruction of&#13;
facilities, fee and fine collection, resolution of disputes, and provision of an organized means for extension&#13;
and farmer trainilng. Recognition of these benefits (and a realization that many of irrigation performance&#13;
problems were poor O&amp;M, brought on by government institutional failures'") led to a marked increase&#13;
in the development of user associations in the past 20 years." Developing country experiences with&#13;
WUAs vary considerably, but valuable lessons can be drawn for Pakistan's strategy.  Histories of&#13;
successful indigenous system development, however, reveal a common pattern: successful user associations&#13;
develop simultaneously with the planning, construction and expansion or creation of the physical system--&#13;
often over a period of many years.'2&#13;
12.             One of the successful government efforts to promote user participation in irrigation&#13;
management is the Philippines. There, more than 5,600 communal irrigation schemes cover almost half&#13;
of the irrigated land. They conduct O&amp;M  and operate on a self-financing basis with technical assistance&#13;
from  a network of Irrigation Community Organizers.&#13;
13.             In Indonesia, the government sought to turnover small-scale irrigation systems to WlJAs,&#13;
when under-financing of O&amp;M began to threaten system sustainability. The WUAs were given legal&#13;
rights and technical assistance to take on management responsibilities. Since 1987, the government has&#13;
transferred more than 400 systems, covering more than 34,000 ha, to WUAs. Success of the program is&#13;
said to be due to early inclusion of farmers in design and creation of the WUAs.&#13;
14.              In Nepal, 70 percent of all irrigation is now  under farmer control.  Expansion of the&#13;
system  in recent years has been helped by a Bank-financed Irrigation Line of Credit Pilot Project. The&#13;
project extends credit to WUAs which contribute to capital costs for construction of new subsystems and&#13;
take over O&amp;M.&#13;
15.              In Turkey, Irrigation Department's plans for completing transfer of irrigation system by&#13;
the turn of the century are progressing well with more than 200,000 ha transferred so far. Many states&#13;

of India, such as Tamil Nadu, Orissa, Maharashtra and Haryana are embarking on the same approach of&#13;
greater users participation.&#13;
16.           Interest in (and new approaches to) farmer-managed irrigation schemes has grown in Latin&#13;
America as well, most recently in Mexico where large irrigation systems have been transferred to the&#13;
farmers organizations and their federations. More than 2 million ha have been transferred and some of&#13;
the main and branchi canals are managed by the users. In Argentina, traditional user organizations (whose&#13;
members held a total of 100 to 500 ha) were found to be too small to meet the associated costs.&#13;
Maintenance was insufficient, water management was weak, and headenders benefitted disproportionately.&#13;
To capture the economies of scale, these associations merged into larger ones with 5,000 to 15,000 ha.&#13;
Twenty-onie new organizations were formed, covering 200,000 ha. Each organization is autonomous,&#13;
finances its own expenditures, and issues its own regulatioiis in accordance with the newly-enacted water&#13;
law. Each hires professional managers to take charge of for example, water delivery, cost recovery, and&#13;
maintenance. Not only are administrative costs are lower, but the larger organizations have increased&#13;
conveyance efficiency by 10 percent.&#13;
17.           In the Dominican Republic, management of irrigation and drainage systems is transferred&#13;
to WUAs in two project areas, Azua (YSURA) and Santiago (PYRN Contract 1), with total area of 14,400&#13;
ha, serving 6,000 farm  families.  A water users group (Nucleos) was formed on each sublateral.&#13;
Distribution of irrigationi water is controlled by Nucleos after it leaves the lateral canal. The Nucleos on&#13;
an irrigationi lateral subsequently formed a WUA (Junta) that encompassed a complete lateral. After&#13;
transferring the system to the WUAs the cost recovery and O&amp;M of the system has improved significantly.&#13;
18.           In Colombia, management of two large irrigation districts is in the hands WUAs. WUAs&#13;
recover O&amp;M costs through a combination of fixed and volumetric charges, and partly from equipment&#13;
rentals and bank interests.&#13;
19.            The World Bank has played a major role in promoting participatory approaches  to&#13;
irrigation system development and management throughout the world. A recent review of that experience&#13;
has summarized the benefits of an increase in user participation as follows:'3&#13;
(a)    Improved system performance -- clear gains in efficiency and in the standard of service&#13;
are achieved wheni system design and management are transferred to farmers;&#13;
(b)    Reduced governmenr expendilure -- farmer associations have proven to be more effective&#13;
collectors of user fees than government agencies;&#13;
(c)    Sustainability -- farmer participation in the design and construction of irrigation systems&#13;
promotes their sense of "ownership" of the system, and gives farmers a greater level of&#13;
incentive to maintain systems than those constructed by the government; physical and&#13;
financial sustainability of systems are enhanced when O&amp;M costs are met from user fees&#13;
rather than government subsidies;&#13;
(d)    Equity -- a more equitable distribution of water resources to potential beneficiaries is&#13;
achieved in participatory systems than in non-participatory systems;&#13;

(e)    Multiplier Effects -- skills developed by farmers in the participatory framework can be&#13;
expanded to take on greater levels of administrative responsibility and resource&#13;
management; these same skills can be applied to community relations with other&#13;
developmental agencies.&#13;
20.            The community management of groundwater development in conjunction with public&#13;
surface water irrigation schemes has enormous potential for increasing irrigation efficiencies and&#13;
improving agricultural production by putting resource management more directly in the hands of the&#13;
resource users. However, the kinds of institutions required in situations of conjunctive use are very&#13;
different from the Water User Associations conventionally promoted for the management of surface water&#13;
conveyance structures. In conjunctive use situations, individual farmers who have their own tubewells&#13;
have fewer incentives to participate in groundwater development than those dependent on surface irrigation&#13;
water. Nevertheless, farners can derive benefits from common management of groundwater extraction&#13;
by reducing their investment costs, reducing risk of over exploitation and by pressuring the government&#13;
to amend surface water allocations to take advantage of new crop market options available to them.'4&#13;
The proposed project attempts to capitalize on Pakistan's accumulated experience in promoting&#13;
participatory development to build those institutions required for effective irrigation water management&#13;
Farmer Participation: The Pakistan Experience&#13;
2].            The participatory development approach in Pakistan is characterized by the organization&#13;
of small farmiers into decentralized, broad-based and homogeneous interest groups called Village&#13;
Organizations (VO). The approach has its origins in the small farmer development initiatives conceived&#13;
during the cooperative movement of the 1970s. These included the Comila Project in what is now&#13;
Bangladesh and the Daudzai Project near Peshawar implemented by the Pakistan Academy of Rural&#13;
Development. The approach assumes that villagers with relatively homogeneous resources, who own their&#13;
crop land, and who collectively manage the distribution of public resources such as irrigation water and&#13;
common grazing land, will cooperate to finance, manage, and maintain village-level infrastructure projects&#13;
that benefit all villagers.  As the approach has evolved, in the context of donor-supported rural&#13;
development initiatives, local communities establish their own institutions, identify their development&#13;
priorities, organize their resources, manage their development agenda, and create the necessary links for&#13;
continuing technical and financial assistance by outside agencies. The supporting agency -- either&#13;
governmental or nongovernmental -- provides technical and financial assistance, but it does not infringe&#13;
on the autonomy of the village organization. Decision-making rests with the community, which can reject&#13;
the advice and judgement of the project experts."&#13;
22.            The Village Organization approach has had its most long-lived application in the&#13;
development efforts of the Agha Khan Foundation in Pakistan's remote Northern Areas. Since 1982, the&#13;
Agha Khan Rural Support Program (AKRSP) has been developing a model of village self-reliance that&#13;
has been adapted to a wide variety of developmental activities throughout the country.&#13;

Members of the VO meet on a regular basis to identify potential projects, discuss their feasibility, and&#13;
develop a work plan to carry out the project selected for implementation.  The VO  designs and&#13;
implemiienits the project witlh the assistance of AKRSP staff and technical consultants. Members of the VO&#13;
contribute to a collective savings accoun1t that is used to help finance the project, and AKRSP grants the&#13;
village organizationi funds in installmenits as work on the initial infrastructure project proceeds, largely to&#13;
supplement labor costs. All subsequenlt village organizationi activities, including maintenance of the&#13;

Bank, t ISAI.) ClD)A, ODA, Oxflam, the Ford Foundation and the Government of Pakistan, AKRSP has&#13;
expended over $20 millioni to establislh more than 1,400 village organizationis, with a membership that&#13;
includes more tlhan half of all rural househIolds in the project area. These village organizations have&#13;
ulidertakeni mole thani 1,000 village infrastructure schemiies worth $30 million. By any standard of success,&#13;
AKRSP has been a catalyst for local decision making and collective action in rural development.&#13;
Althlough AKRSP functions independently of any government line department operating in the northem&#13;
areas, village organizationis have become vehicles through which villagers make collective demands on&#13;
tile local governm11eint for improvements in public services."6&#13;
25.            The success of the AKRSP is largely responsible for the growing emphasis on community&#13;
participationi in developiment initiatives in recent years throughout Pakistan. For example, the Government&#13;
of Nortlh West Frontier Province, witth assistance from USAID, sanctioiied the creation of the Sarhad Rural&#13;
Support Corporation in 1990 to assist the provincial governlment in the implementation of donor-funded&#13;
area development projects."7  A number of donor-supported natural resource management projects in&#13;
S'indlh, B3alochistani, Punjab and Azad Jammu and Kashmir have also been designed to incorporate villager&#13;
participation in tlleir implementation.  In 1992, the AKRSP approach was adopted at the national level&#13;
with the creation of the National Rural Support Program to implement the Government's multi-sectoral&#13;
Social Action Plan on a nation-wide scale.&#13;
26.            At the time that the AKRSP VO approachi was being developed in Pakistan's remote areas,&#13;
donors were attempting to apply the growinig world-wide experience with participatory development in&#13;
the irrigation sector to the improved delivery of surface water for irrigated agriculture in Pakistan's&#13;
densely populated Indus Basin. The cornerstonie of this approach was the organization of farmers into&#13;
Water User Associations for the improvement of canal infrastructure and the improved management of&#13;
irrigation water.&#13;

Management Pilot Project (1976-81) in which farmers supplied all unskilled labor for watercourse&#13;
improvement -- cleaning, realignment, and lining with bricks and mortar -- while the government provided&#13;
materials and technical assistance. Systems restored under this project deteriorated rapidly because farmers&#13;
were not organized to maintain the improved watercourses once they were improved. The World Bank&#13;
built upon the lessons learned from the USAID-supported effort through the development of the On-Farm&#13;
Water Management Program (OFWM). The general aim of OFWM program has been to promote the&#13;
formation of local-level Water User Associations (WUA) that can assume the operations and maintenance&#13;
of tertiary irrigation channels, or watercourses. The program works through WUAs to mobilize labor and&#13;
funds for the improvement and maintenance of watercourses, with watercourse lining serving as the major&#13;
incentive for farmer participation in the program.  The Bank required that each of the four provinces&#13;
implementing the program establish legal ordinance formalizing the procedures for the organization and&#13;
registration of WUA at the watercourse command level. OFWM programs also attempt to link farmers&#13;
with specialized public services that introduce cultivation practices for maximizing available water use.&#13;
These services include contract grading, precision land leveling and improved agricultural extension.&#13;
28.           In Punjab, a Directorate of On-Farm  Water Management was created within the&#13;
Agriculture Department to provide training to WUA leadership and field-level assistance to help farmers&#13;
organize WUAs. WUAs proved to be effective institutions for mobilizing labor to improve watercourses&#13;
and more than 17,000 have been registered. However, because the farmers were legally organized and&#13;
empowered solely to improve the physical infrastructure of the watercourse, there was little incentive&#13;
beyond the immediate inputs of the project for farmers to maintain the WUA or the watercourses. As a&#13;
result, the improvement of civil works alone had little or no positive effect on equity of water delivery,&#13;
even though there has been some increase in supply at tailend farms. Seepage losses were diminished if&#13;
not eliminated with canal lining but there remain considerable water losses along channels because of&#13;
operational waste and theft of water through outlet tampering.'8&#13;
29.           The disappointing results of OFWM efforts to date are largely due to organizational&#13;
inequities both within the beneficiary communities and the public agencies mandated to serve those&#13;
communities.  Watercourses are a classic common property resource shared by 20 to 100 farmers.&#13;
However, there are many different categories of farmers in the irrigated areas of Punjab. They are defined&#13;
by such factors as: the size and tenure arrangements of their land holdings; social and economic status;&#13;
ethnic and kinship identities; political affiliations; varying access to bureaucracy; and linkages with the&#13;
national economy. Farmers may have too few common interests to sustain multipurpose joint action.&#13;
Conversely, sub-groups within a WUA (e.g., extended families and lineages, or biradari) have interests&#13;
that are not common to the entire community of water users.&#13;
30.           Moreover, WIUAs have little influence as institutions aside from the mobilization of labor&#13;
to achieve the objectives of the OFWM program. While the Punjab Water User Association ordinance of&#13;
1981 established the WUAs as legal entities vis-a-vis the Irrigation Department and the Directorate of&#13;
OFWM, other government agencies are not bound to recognize WUAs, and the WUAs have no authority&#13;
to deal with other government departments. Yet, even minor water management issues and repairs to&#13;
watercourse may involve other government agencies, for example, the Revenue Department, which levies&#13;
taxes on WUA members, not the WUA itself. In effect, the WUA has no legal mandate for systems&#13;
operation and water resource management. While scarcity helped stimulate the formation of WUAs, once&#13;

the surface supply of water improved as a result of improvements to physical infrastructure, the&#13;
organizations became dormant.'9 As one analyst notes, the OFWM experience demonstrates that, to&#13;
ensure sustainable farmer organizations, a working agreement and its legal framework must provide&#13;
farmiers with rights and benefits as well as with duties and responsibilities.20&#13;
3 1.           The proliferation of affordable lift technology for the private extraction of groundwater&#13;
has revolutionized small-farmer production systems in Punjab.  It has also called into question the&#13;
continuing efficiency of public institutions in the management of the irrigation sector. However, the&#13;
relatively unrestricted pumping of groundwater by private farmers poses enonnous economic and&#13;
environmental risks for irrigated agriculture in Punjab. As the following section points out, participatory&#13;
development of groundwater resources represents a balanced strategy for the sustainable management of&#13;
irrigation water.&#13;
The Transition from Public to Private Development of Groundwater Resources&#13;
32.            Over the last three decades, approximately 13,500 public tubewells have been installed&#13;
by the Government of Pakistan to control waterlogging and saline soil conditions throughout the irrigated&#13;
areas of the Indus River Basin under a succession of Salinity Control and Reclamation Projects (SCARP).&#13;
Nearly 75 percent of these tubewells were installed in Punjab Province. In saline groundwater areas,&#13;
SCARP tubewells pumped water into surface drains or main canals. In fresh groundwater areas, water&#13;
from STWs was normally pumped into tertiary watercourses and used to augment surface irrigation water&#13;
supplies. The SCARP projects were generally successful in meeting the objectives of controlling the depth&#13;
of water tables and supplementing surface irrigation water supplies. However, STW performance has&#13;
declined over tine due to poor management, political interference and inadequate funding for O&amp;M. Half&#13;
of all STWs in Punjab operate at below 50 percent capacity, and only 15 percent operate at better than&#13;
80 percent capacity.&#13;
33.            Poor STW  performance has in a number of areas been compensated by informal farmers&#13;
groups that have formed spontaneously. These groups look after daily operations of the pump and its&#13;
routine maintenance. These groups also finance major repairs using local mechanics, electricians and other&#13;
services from local markets. However, farmers find it difficult to carry out repairs involving the main&#13;
shaft of the turbine because such repairs require specialized equipment available only with Punjab&#13;
Irrigation Department (PID) workshops. Nevertheless, farmers follow-up and assist PID in expediting such&#13;
repairs.&#13;
34.            SCARP Transition    Beginning in 1991, with a series of SCARP Transition Project,&#13;
the Bank sought to counter the impact of the deteriorating  STW  performance by supporting the&#13;
privatization of groundwater extraction and application. By offering subsidies and credit to farmers for&#13;
the installation of private tubewells (PTWs), the Bank sought to: (i) increase agricultural production&#13;
through improved and timely provision of supplementary irrigation water; (ii) control water table levels&#13;
so that they do not adversely effect production; (iii) reduce the PID's budgetary burden by closing all&#13;
STWs and replacing them with privately-operated and maintained tubewells. However, the closure of the&#13;
STWs posed a significant problem for farmers at the tailend of watercourses, particularly those farmers&#13;

who cannot afford to install PTWs. The supplemental flows that the STW contribute to surface water&#13;
delivery systems increase the reliability of water reaching the tailend of the watercourse. With the closure&#13;
of the STWs, surface water supplies would no longer reach the tail. Consequently, tailend farmers have&#13;
to rely more or less entirely on groundwater. However, even though the number of PTWs is quite high&#13;
in some of the project areas, farmers without PTWs do not have an assured supply of groundwater.&#13;
Instead, they must rely on those that do to sell surplus water at high rates. In areas where groundwater&#13;
is saline. exclusive dependence on groundwater for irrigation inevitably leads to deterioration of soil&#13;
conditions and decrease in crop yields.&#13;
35.           The Bank determined that the promotion of PTW development was inappropriate because&#13;
it led to farmers installing excessive pumping capacity, which in turn led to them incurring excessive&#13;
operations and maintenianice costs. Excess pumping capacity leads to the over exploitation of groundwater,&#13;
promotes greater inequity in water supply, and the improper conjunctive use of canal and groundwater.&#13;
The Mid-Term Review of the Second SCARP Transition Project (SSTP) determined the best remedy to&#13;
this situation was to eliminate continued subsidies for PTWs.  Instead, the Mid-Term  Review&#13;
recommended the promotion of collective investment by farmers in Community Tubewells (CTWs) to&#13;
replace STWs at the head or middle reaches of the watercourse, and the continued improvement of&#13;
conveyance efficiencies throughi watercourse lining.2&#13;
36.    The Introduction of Farmer Participation.  Following  the Mid-Term  Review, a social&#13;
mobilization strategy was developed for the SSTP to establish Farmer Organizations (FO) throughout the&#13;
project area capable of installing, operating and maintaining CTWs. In the absence of significant&#13;
experience mobilizling community participation, four different approaches for establishing FOs were&#13;
developed.  One approach relies on the SSTP implementation consultants to train and field Social&#13;
Organizers who work intensively with farmers to build FOs. Another approach utilizes a national rural&#13;
service NGO, the National Farm Guides, that works under the supervision of the of the SSTP consultants&#13;
to establish FOs. A third approach utilizes the services of the Irrigation Agronomy Teams of the&#13;
Directorate of OFWM to establish FOs in those areas of SSTP where it is implementing watercourse&#13;
improvement in conjunction witil the projects groundwater privatization efforts. Finally, a fourth approach&#13;
utilizes the services of the canal paItwari or field-level revenue agents of the Provincial Irrigation&#13;
Department (PID).&#13;
37.           Under the SSTP farmer participation strategy, FOs are required to have a membership of&#13;
approximately one-third of the water users (shareholders) on a targeted watercourse. The FOs may choose&#13;
to register as a formal legal entity or as a subset of a Water User Association (if one exists on the&#13;
watercourse) under the Provincial Water User Association Ordinance. FOs have three options for the&#13;
establishment of a CTW: (I) purchase the original STW from the PID and utilize the original equipment;&#13;
(ii) replace the bore and pump of the existing STW with project (partial) financial and technical&#13;
assistance; (iii) or install a new tubewell at another site along the watercourse. FOs must nominate a&#13;
management committee, establish a bank account, and deposit funds for their share of CTW installation&#13;
costs plus the estimated cost of one year's operation and maintenance.  A fund for the eventual&#13;
replacement of the CTW is generated from the sale of water to FO members or to non-members. In the&#13;
case of option iii, FOs must also secure an agreement from the landowner on whose property the new&#13;
CTW will be installed for unrestricted access by the FO members. Once the CTW is installed, each&#13;
member pays a fixed rate -- established by the FO to meet operation and maintenance costs -- to the&#13;
management committee for each hour of pumping required to water his fields.&#13;

38.            Under the revised SSTP, a Project Impact Evaluation Study (PIES) was funded to monitor&#13;
and evaluate the formation of FOs. The Interim  Report of the PIES consultants evaluated the farmer&#13;
participation approach implemented by the SSTP consultants most favorably in terms of SO training,&#13;
reconnaissance and familiarizing farmers with the aims of the project, efforts to facilitate formation and&#13;
provide continiuotis support to FOs, and overall performance in meeting targets (i.e., number of FOs&#13;
established and CTWs installed against the number of STWs for which they were responsible).22  The&#13;
evaluationi results were based on only three months of field implementation. Thus, the results cannot be&#13;
considered an effective indicator of sustainability of project initiatives, nor the sustainability of the FOs&#13;
themilselves. Hlowever, the study results indicate that a large-scale and effective farmer participation effort&#13;
can be mobilized in a relatively short period of time. The success of Social Organizers in meeting&#13;
physical targets also suggests that there is considerable receptivity among farmers to the development of&#13;
CTWs.&#13;
39.            During the Appraisal mission for the proposed project -- after more than six months of&#13;
SSTP's efforts to promote farmer participation -- the Appraisal Team assessed SSTP's social mobilization&#13;
approacih througil a review of project monitorinig and evaluation reports, interviews with Social Organizers&#13;
and( field visits to Farmer Organizations formed utilizing each of the four approaches supported by SSTP.&#13;
The most frequently cited obstacles that SOs faced in mobilizing farner participation in CTW  schemes&#13;
iniclude the Following:&#13;
(a)    Conflicts and rivalries based in traditional political, class, communal, and inter-fanilial&#13;
alliances in rural Punjab typically discourage local-level collaboration.&#13;
(b)    Opposition of farmers with large landholdings who derive the most significant benefits&#13;
from functioniing STWs -- both in terms of low cost water and high application rates --&#13;
to the closing of STWs. These farmers attempt to use political influence to prevent the&#13;
STW  closing, and to dissuade smaller farmers who share the watercourse from organizing&#13;
and taking advantage of project benefits.&#13;
(c)     Fanner demand for larger subsidies and concessions from the project to compensate for&#13;
the sharp increase in the cost of groundwater that results from the closure of STWs.&#13;
(d)    Opposition of farmers with PTWs who fear that a proliferation of CTWs will undernine&#13;
their market for surplus groundwater.&#13;
40.            There is ample evidence of collective action among farming households in Punjab to&#13;
suggest that these conflicts and rivalries are not an insurmounitable obstacle to FO  formation and&#13;
sustainabilitv. Warabandi, the system by whicih farilers share surface irrigation water supplies in turn,&#13;
has been in continuous operation throughout the irrigated areas of the Indus Basin for well over 100 years.&#13;
Farn families throughlout the Punjab typically exchange labor during peak agricultural production periods&#13;
in a system known as warang. The evidence of informal farmers groups that have taken over the&#13;
operation and maintenance of STWs, and of private tubewells operated by small numbers of farm families&#13;
in the project area also indicates that there exists a potential for collective capital investment and enduring&#13;
cooperation in the operation and maintenance of capital goods at the farm level. SOs can build on these&#13;
traditional and spontaneous institutions of cooperation to promote support for the FO&#13;

41.    Equity Issues. With regard to the influence of large landholders, or those who have heretofore&#13;
monopolized capital investment and water markets, there is evidence to suggest that this influence may&#13;
effect the equity of the water distribution, which the proposed project attempts to promote in a number&#13;
of areas. From the Appraisal Team's field investigations, it was evident that certain members of a group&#13;
were financing the membership of poorer shareholders by subsidizing their cash contribution to the FO.&#13;
It is possible that more influential and wealthy farmers may use their advantage to dominate the FO and&#13;
monopolize some, or all, of the resources of the CTW. In these circumstances of a very hierarchical&#13;
social structure and an inequitable distribution of assets and resources, it may be unrealistic to expect that&#13;
truly equitable and democratic Farmer Organizations can be supported throughout the project area. As&#13;
the recent World Bank assessment of participation in the irrigation sector notes, participation may be at&#13;
odds with equity objectives where some groups have more influence than others. In a number of areas,&#13;
powerful farmers are likely to have more influence than others in irrigation associations -- ironically, they&#13;
may function more effectively as the result of the influence of powerful farmers. While inequities cannot&#13;
be eliminated altogether, efforts can be made to structure organizations and target project resources to&#13;
maximize the potential for equitable distribution of resources.23 For example, the proposed project will&#13;
attempt to target tailend farners by encouraging FOs to cite CTWs in the middle of the watercourse, rather&#13;
that at the head, in an attempt to improve the reliability of water delivery to the tailend.24&#13;
42.             A key element in the success of the farmer participation plan implemented by the SSTP&#13;
consultants is the extent that the SOs serve as intermediaries between the FO membership and the&#13;
government functionaries who sanction FO formation. SOs effectively "level the playing field" for all&#13;
farmers to participate in project activities by intervening on behalf of an FO's membership in activities&#13;
that would ordinarily cost farmers considerable time and money. These activities include the opening of&#13;
an FO bank account, registering the FO, and attesting the FO's registration and bank balance to the project&#13;
authorities to secure financial assistance for CTW installation.&#13;
43.             Another key element in the initial success of the SSTP farmer participation approach is&#13;
the promotion of farmer collaboration in productive investments, i.e., a CTW that provides FO&#13;
membership greater control over the application of irrigation water.  As the AKRSP experience&#13;
demonstrates, collective investment activities show the most promise for improving the sustainability of&#13;
farmer organizations. In contrast, OFWM efforts to build sustainable WUAs by providing improved&#13;
agricultural extension services fell short. Recent research indicates that Pakistan's farmers use available&#13;
water supplies with maximum efficiency. While OFWM interventions may have improved the reliability&#13;
of surface water deliveries, they did not improve that level of reliability enough to enable middle and&#13;
tailend farmners to increase the profitability of their farms in the way that PTWs and CTWs do.25&#13;
21   Meinzen-Dick, et al. 1995. op. cit.&#13;
2    An example of the impact of more equitable distribution of water resources can be found among FOs established&#13;
under the SSTP in Jaranwala Tehsil, Faisalabad District. Two CTWs were installed at a bifurcation of the main&#13;
watercourse supplied by the upper branch of the Rakh Canal and supplemented by water pumped from STW No.&#13;
JW 118. Because of improved water supply, each member of the FO situated at the tailend of the watercourse&#13;
reported sowing a rice crop on land that had previously not been cultivated due to lack of irrigation water.&#13;
25   Goldensohn, 1994. op. cit. The ADB-supported Second Community Irrigation Project in Muzzafarabad District of&#13;
Punjab has applied the principal of productive investment in the promotion of FO organization and installation of&#13;
CTWs. Under this project, FOs are organized among watercourse shareholders and provided incentives to take over&#13;
the operation of the existing STWs. In addition, the project provides farm implements to the FO, which rents these&#13;
implements to members.&#13;

Lessons Learned&#13;
44.           From the review of farmer participation in Pakistan, and specifically in the irrigation&#13;
sector, the following lessons can be drawn:&#13;
(a)    The conjunctive use of surface and groundwater resources improves irrigation efficiencies&#13;
and the equity of resource distribution.&#13;
(b)    In comparison with public and private (individual) systems of pump irrigation, inigation&#13;
efficiencies and equity of water distribution improve when farming communities&#13;
collaborate to operate and maintain tubewells and the conjunctive use of surface and&#13;
groundwater resources.&#13;
(c)    The sustainability of farmer organizations is directly proportional to the extent that they&#13;
are organized around productive investment and they have true control over the&#13;
management of those resources to maximize return on the investment.&#13;
(d)    The formation of enduring farmer organizations requires continuous support at the social&#13;
as well as the technical level to ensure that the organization endures potential social,&#13;
economic and political conflicts that discourage collective action.&#13;
(e)    Under current circumstances in Punjab, consultants are likely to provide the best level of&#13;
support to FOs. Government departments do not have the capacity or experience to&#13;
support FOs, and ingrained procedures prevent government bureaucracies from readily&#13;
adapting to what has been considered more effective procedures.&#13;
(f)    NGO capacity in Punjab is oriented towards the promotion of social welfare and not&#13;
participatory rural development. However, the their social activism and familiarity with&#13;
rural social relations can be tapped and used effectively when consultants provide capacity&#13;
building and administrative support to NGO staff.&#13;
45.           These lessons have been incorporated into the proposed plan for farmer participation in&#13;
the proposed Project described in the following section.&#13;
Farmer Participation Under the Project&#13;
46.    The Institutional Framework.       The proposed project aims to convert approximately 4,200&#13;
STWs in four SCARP regions of Punjab Province over a period of five years. The project will support&#13;
the formation of approximately 6,300 village-level Farmer Organizations (FOs) and their development of&#13;
privately operated community tubewells (CTWs) to replace government-operated STWs throughout the&#13;
project area. The objective of this project activity is to develop FOs that can efficiently operate and&#13;
maintain surface and groundwater resources for irrigated agriculture in Punjab on a sustainable basis. The&#13;
achievement of this objective will require considerable human and financial resources. A grass roots effort&#13;
of this type requires an organization with specific skills and experience in social mobilization and a&#13;
network of local level contacts. The Bank's pre-appraisal mission explored the possibility of using NGOs&#13;
to assume responsibility for managing the social mobilization aspects of the project. However, it was&#13;
mission's assessment that NGO capacity in Punjab is too limited to handle the extensive task. Therefore,&#13;
the preferred alternative is to establish an institutional framework consisting of a Project Management Unit&#13;
(PMU); social mobilization consultants and local level NGOs with the participation of PAD and PID.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
-94-                                  Page 14 of 17&#13;
47.           The project will support the development of a farmer participation program within the&#13;
PMU. The PMU will have overall responsibility for the project's social mobilization efforts through a&#13;
Community Development Support Group (CDSG) recruited as consultancy services. The CDSG team will&#13;
consist of: i) a core staff responsible for CDSG field staff training and management, and social&#13;
mobilization program coordination; and ii) a field staff of Social Organizers (SOs) working with the help&#13;
of NGOs and village level social activists to mobilize farmer participation in project activities. CDSG will&#13;
have responsibility for the privatization of approximately 2700, or two-thirds of the STWs targeted for&#13;
privatization. The Directorate of On Farm Water Management (OFWM) will be responsible for the&#13;
privatization of the remaining targeted STWs in conjunction with a program of project-supported&#13;
watercourse improvement. The PMU will have responsibility for coordination and supervision of all STW&#13;
privatization and FO development activities supported by the project, including those undertaken by&#13;
OFWM&#13;
48.            The CDSG core staff will be comprised of internationally recruited consultants.  The&#13;
core team will include a Team Leader (45 sm), a Deputy Team Leader (60 sm), a Social Mobilization&#13;
Specialist (15 sin) and a Training Specialist (5 sm). The core consultants will be based in Lahore and&#13;
housed in the offices of the PMU. The core team will be responsible for training SOs in farmer group&#13;
formation and social assessment, as well as develop farmer training packages for SOs in basic literacy,&#13;
financial management (bookkeeping, credit management, savings), legal requirements of FOs, operations&#13;
and maintenance (including water sales), interaction with Government agencies, and dispute resolution.&#13;
49.           The consultants would provide up to 445 staff years of services over the five year life of&#13;
the project. These consultants would comprise a Field Operations Management team, based in Lahore,&#13;
four Watercourse Assessment Survey Teams, and four social mobilization field teams whose size will be&#13;
expanded as project activities increase in geographical scope. In addition to support staff, each field team&#13;
will typically include: one Social Coordinator (SC), with responsibilities for managing the field office; two&#13;
Technical Coordiniators (TCs); up to ten Social Organizers (SOs), up to five After-care Social Organizers&#13;
(ASOs). and a Watercourse Assessment Survey Team. Wherever possible, SOs and ASOs will be&#13;
recruited through local NGOs throughout the project area to promote the development of effective&#13;
relationshilps with potential beneficiaries.&#13;
50.    Social Mobilization Strategy.      The project will promote the formation of at least one FO&#13;
per watercourse supplied by each STW targeted for privatization. The participation of at least 30 percent&#13;
of the farmers who are watercourse shareholders is required to form an FO. Once established, the FO will&#13;
be offered financial assistance amounting to Rs. 20,000 towards the modification/rehabilitation of an&#13;
existing STW or the installation of a new CTW. This amount represents approximately 30 percent of the&#13;
capital cost of a new CTW. The remaining cost will be borne by the FO membership. FOs choosing to&#13;
assume ownership and operation of the existing STW will be charged Rs. 10,000 for the capital transfer.&#13;
51.           Based on the SSTP's experience with promoting farmer participation, it is estimated that&#13;
one trained SO can complete the privatization of 15 STWs per year. It is also estimated that the STW&#13;
transition -- from the initial point of contact between SO and potential members of an FO to the&#13;
completion of CTW installation -- will require as much as 16 weeks of ongoing support from CDSG field&#13;
office staff, at least in the introductory stages of the social mobilization program in the target areas. An&#13;
additional 14 to 24 months of field staff effort will be dedicated to supporting the ongoing functions of&#13;
each FO. Each SO will be assigned a cluster of 30 STWS within which he/she will concentrate his/her&#13;
efforts for a period of eighteen months to two years. The scope of field staff activities required to support&#13;
FO formation can be divided into three distinct stages -- pre-STW transition, transition and post-transition.&#13;
An illustrative scope of these activities is as follows:&#13;

(a)    the closure of the STW;&#13;
(b)    the benefits of a CTW  such as lower financial costs of installation of a CTW&#13;

holders; lower O&amp;M costs; benefits of conjunctive use of CTW  with surface&#13;
supplies, which are not available with a PTW, greater equity in distribution of&#13;

Transition Stage&#13;
Weeks 4-8     SO and ASOs assist in the organization of shareholders into FOs to take advantage of the&#13;
project's financial incentives for developing CTWs. This assistance, provided through&#13;
weekly or more frequent visits, as required, includes: verification of each FO member's&#13;
share holding; the designation of FO office bearers (President, Vice-President, Secretary&#13;
and Treasurer); the opening of an FO bank account with donations made by each member&#13;
pro-rated against the size of his/her landholding; development of an administrative&#13;
capacity within the FO through counseling in organizational methods, conflict resolution&#13;
and training in record and accounts keeping; and technical advice (from the TCs) on&#13;
tubewell location, installation, and selection, operation and maintenance of pumpsets.&#13;
Weeks 8-16    SOs and ASOs supervise CTW  installation and facilitate the processing of project's&#13;
financial assistance payment to the FO.&#13;
Post-Transition Stage&#13;
Weeks 17-24  ASOs make regular visits to the FO to monitor continuity of farmer participation; discuss&#13;
and promote improved agronomic and water management practices; mediate disputes and&#13;
collect quantitative and qualitative data to monitor project impact.&#13;

52.           The deployment of field staff will be staggered throughout an individual cluster. An SO&#13;
or ASO will participate in each Watercourse Assessment Survey conducted in his/her cluster and return&#13;
to previously surveyed watercourses to promote FO formation or service existing FOs on a regular basis.&#13;
TCs sNill be called upOnl to support FOs at any point in the transition or post-transition process.  This&#13;
process v ill conti11ue until the transition stage in all targeted watercourses in a cluster has been completed,&#13;
at wNhicch point the SO will move on to his/lher next desigilated cluster to continue the process.&#13;
53.            Field staff capacity and farner receptivity will both factor significantly il the timing and&#13;
success of CDSG field operations. The size and deployment of field staff will also be influenced by the&#13;
extent to whiich NGOs are engaged in field implementation of CDSG social mobilization activities.&#13;
54.    Training.      The CDSG core staff will develop curriculum and materials for training the social&#13;
mobi I ization field staff in the principles of participatory community development, and appropriate methods&#13;
for mobilizling farmer participation in FOs. Core staff will also develop training modules for FOs in&#13;
record keeping and fiianicial manageinent that can be taught by SOs in the field. The core staff will&#13;
organize and facilitate all project start-up traininig workshops and semilars, and subsequent refresher&#13;
courses for project field staff. In addition, the core staff will also work with the Department of Irrigation&#13;
and OFWM  to develop short introductory courses in hydrology, irrigation engineering, tubewell&#13;
mechianiics, watcr resource management and agronomy for the social mobilization field team members.&#13;
55.           Semin1ars will be organized for field staff every three months. These seminars will create&#13;
an opportunity for SOs to share experiences and lessons learned in their efforts to organize farmers. The&#13;
seminiars will also provide an opportunity to improve field training materials and to fine-tune the project's&#13;
overall farner participation approach. SOs will also bring together a number of FO leaders three times&#13;
per year for discussions on water resource management, problem solving, and the sharing of information&#13;
and experience. These discussions will serve as a foundation for developing a model for the establishment&#13;
of federations of FOs to manage the secondary levels of the canal systems such as distributaries and minor&#13;
canals.&#13;
56.    The Farmer Organization Development Plan.           The Government of Punjab has established&#13;
PMU and its staffing would be completed by the negotiations. The recruitment of social and management&#13;
consultanlts has started and it would be completed by June, 1996. Social mobilization consultants will be&#13;
in the field by end July, 1996 and start recruitment of SOs. Recruitment of SOs (about 20 SOs and&#13;
support staff for transferring first batch of STWs) and establishment of field offices will be completed by&#13;
the end September, 1996 (Chart- I ). Training of SOs will be a continuous process, however, the first batch&#13;
will be completed by the end of November, 1996. Social mobilization will start fully from January, 1997&#13;
and about 300 STWs would be transferred by June 30, 1997. The cumulative transfer progress would&#13;
be about 1,300 by June 30, 1998, 2,300 by June 30, 1999, about 3,300 by June 30, 2000 and 4,233 by&#13;
Junie 30. 2001.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
57.           Local consultancy services in project monitoring and evaluation will be required to study&#13;
and assess the success of the project in meeting the objectives cited above, and to assess the physical,&#13;
social and economic impact of the project on the project area and its inhabitants.  The Project&#13;
Implementation and Evaluation (PIES) consultanits will assess: (i) impact of the project on water use and&#13;
equity in the distribution of water resources; (ii) performance of likely sustainability of FOs; and (iii)&#13;
performance of technical assistance contractors in supporting the management and implementation of all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

project initiatives.&#13;
58.           PIE consultants will be required to develop a case study methodology to monitor and&#13;
assess the effectiveness of both CDSG and OFWM FO formation efforts, and the impact that the transition&#13;
from reliance on STWs to CTWs installed by FOs has on the equitable distribution of water resources and&#13;
the incomes of participating farmers.  Specifically, the PIE consultants will consider:&#13;
(a)    The effectiveness of CDSG training and support to Social Organizers responsible for the&#13;
implementation of its social mobilization program, particularly in the formation of FOs&#13;
and the subsequent provision of technical services to improve on farm water management;&#13;
(b)    The extent to which FOs are formed and successfully install, operate and maintain CTWs.&#13;
(c)    The impact of transition from STWs to CTWs on the conjunctive use of water for&#13;
irrigation, and the consequences for water supply reliability for watercourse tailend users.&#13;
(d)    Changes in cropping patterns, including a shift towards production of higher value crops,&#13;
increased cropping intensities and improved crop yields that result from project activities;&#13;
59.           PIE studies will combine both quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative methods&#13;
will include socio-economic baseline surveys of a purposive sample of targeted watercourses . The&#13;
watercourse survey sample will include watercourses targeted by the project as well as watercourses that&#13;
lie outside of the project area. These non-project area watercourses will constitute a control that provides&#13;
project managers with data on socioeconomic, agronomic and hydrological developments independent of&#13;
project inputs. Sample watercourses will be monitored on a biannual basis during the course of the rabi&#13;
and kharif cropping seasons over the life of the project to measure project impact against baseline data.&#13;
60.           Qualitative data gathering methods will be employed to compile more detailed and&#13;
continuous data on project impact and sustainability than is generally derived from quantitative survey&#13;
instruments, and as a check on the reliability of survey data. Data gathering methods will include regular&#13;
semi-structured interviews of key informants and focus groups, and participant observation (e.g., overnight&#13;
stays in villages and participation in FO activities).&#13;

PAKISTAN&#13;
Punjab Private Sector Groundwater Development Project&#13;
Groundwater Management and Regulation&#13;
L. BACKGROUND&#13;
Agriculture is the main economic base of Pakistan. Because of climatic conditions&#13;
irrigatioii is essential for sustained agricultural production.  Even though irrigation has existed for&#13;
centuries. the relatively recent expansion of surface water delivery systems has resulted in significant&#13;
hydrological changes. The additional supplies of surface water to the irrigated land without appropriate&#13;
drainage facilities has resulted in increased groundwater levels causing either waterlogged areas or saline&#13;
intrusioni or both. The Salinity Control and Reclamation Projects (SCARP) were commenced in the&#13;
1960's to conitrol waterlogginig and salinity in irrigated areas.  Large size tubewells operated and&#13;
maintained by the Government were installed under these projects. While the SCARP tubewells were&#13;
largely successful in controlling waterlogging and salinity their performance declined due to lack of funds&#13;
for O&amp;M and poor management. In addition to drainage, tubewells in fresh groundwater area provide&#13;
substantial irrigation supplies, supplementing the canal water. Because the farmers saw the viability and&#13;
advantages of groundwater development, a very large number of private tubewells (PTW) have been&#13;
installed. This had the affect of lowering groundwater levels, and in some locations, encouraging saline&#13;
water intrision inito fresh water zones.  There are several reasons for excessive pumpage from&#13;
grounidwater. Due to inequitable distribution of surface supplies in some areas groundwater is the only&#13;
source for irrigation specifically towards the tails of the surface systems. Lack of knowledge about crop&#13;
water requirements and the use of flat rate charges for electricity are also contributing factors to the&#13;
overdraft.&#13;
2.            The groundwater records indicate that the water tables in fresh areas in general are falling&#13;
slowly. This coupled with the continued proliferation of PTWs could potentially damage the groundwater&#13;
aquifers. A plan for managinig the groundwater resources should be considered at this stage to avoid&#13;
problems whiich could arise due unregulated development.  Therefore, as a part of the project, a&#13;
groundwater management plan applicable to all aquifers in Punjab would be developed. This annex&#13;
provides an outlile of methodology for developing groundwater management and regulation and plan for&#13;
its implementation.&#13;
11. EXISTING LEGISLATION &amp; REGULATIONS&#13;
I.     Punjab Soil Reclamation Act, 1952&#13;
Applicable Provisions&#13;
defines tube-well as "well worked with electric or thermal power to draw out sub-soil&#13;
water" (Chapter I para 2).&#13;
authorizes the Board, to prevent waterlogging and salinity, "to provide for the installation,&#13;
management and maintenance of tubewells and disposal of underground water by other&#13;
means"; "the draining of villages and land"; "replacement of canal water supply by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

tubewell or open well in part or whole"; "the temporary increase or decrease of water&#13;
allowance to any area or total curtailment of water supply"; "the prohibition of growing&#13;
of any crops or laying down any specific crop rotation". (Chapter IV, para 17).&#13;
"As soon as a scheme ... is sanctioned as notified ... the use of underground waters in that&#13;
area except the water used for domestic purposes or for watering livestock shall come&#13;
Linder control of the Board". (Chapter IV, para 26).&#13;
In the area for whichi the scheme has been sanctioned the Board may order any tubewell&#13;
for using groundwater, to be closed down either temporarily during specified period of&#13;
the year or permanently, provided that such shall order not prohibit use of underground&#13;
waters by any owner or occupier of land for domestic purposes and for watering livestock.&#13;
For the improvement, reclamation and lowering of sub-soil water table in any local area...&#13;
the Board may - direct in respect to any area - the permitting by the owners and occupiers&#13;
of setting tubewells and borings and use of water therefrom in place of that canal".&#13;
(Chapter V, para 28)&#13;
Discussion&#13;
Although the main objective of the Soil Reclamation Act at the time of its enactment was&#13;
controlling waterlogging and salinity, the Act has provision for controlling the&#13;
groundwater use when such use has adverse effect on the resources.&#13;
T he Punjab Government issues a series of rules (1965) for safe exploitation of&#13;
groundwater aquifers. These rules included requirement for a license for installing&#13;
tubewells in the areas declared as project by the Government, procedures and forms for&#13;
obtaining license, and established license fees.&#13;
Powers of the Board changed from time to time. The executive powers are now exercised&#13;
by the Secretary, Irrigation and Power Development (effective January 3 1, 1973).&#13;
T here is no evidence that the Rule above was ever implemented.&#13;
2.     West Pakistan Water and Power Development Authority, Act 1958.&#13;
Applicable Provisions&#13;
-      "subject to the provision of any other law for the time being in force, the Authority --shall&#13;
have control over the underground water resources of any regime in West Pakistan" (para&#13;
11).&#13;
-      "before the Authority exercises control ... the area over which and the extent to which and&#13;
the extent to which control is intended to be exercised shall be agreed to and notified by&#13;
the Government in the official Gazette" (para I I).&#13;
Discussion&#13;
No evidence of any issuing of required rules.&#13;
WAPDA is a Federal agency and since the Pakistan Constitution reserves the control over&#13;
water to the Provinces there is some question as to the actual authority of WAPDA to&#13;
regulate groundwater.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.     Punjab Local Government Ordinance, 1979&#13;
(Similar Ordinances for the Provinces - both rural and urban councils).&#13;
Applicable Provision&#13;
-      "All private sources of water supply within the local area of the urban local council shall&#13;
be subject to control, regulation and inspection by the urban local council".&#13;
Discussion:   No known regulation or enforcement.&#13;
Related Matters&#13;
4.     The Preamble to the WAPDA Act provides for the unified and coordinated development of the&#13;
water and power resources of Pakistan. It also extends WAPDA's control over the groundwater aquifers,&#13;
however, this control is in the context of controlling waterlogging and salinity. In accordance with the&#13;
Preamble WAPDA collects, analyzes and publishes surface and groundwater data. Although water quality&#13;
data collection is now limited to SCARP areas with increased staff the program could cover the whole&#13;
country. WAPDA also collects climatology data nationally.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
5.     Neither the Government of Pakistan nor any Provincial Government has undertaken groundwater&#13;
regulation except for spacing of wells in SCARP areas. The control provisions in WAPDA Act may be&#13;
limited by the Constitutional provision of water being the subject of Provinces. The Soil Reclamation Act&#13;
of 1952 with its amendments appears to be most specific legislation about controlling installation of&#13;
tubewells where these have ill effects oii the resources.&#13;
6.    In any event WAPDA would be responsible for overall monitoring of the basins' surface and&#13;
groundwater resource, inter-provincial transfers of surface, ground and drainage waters. Even though&#13;
WAPDA could perhaps be designated as the groundwater regulating agency with some relatively minor&#13;
legal changes, a conflict could arise between the development arm of WAPDA and the regulatory element&#13;
which is better suited for provincial and local Governments. Therefore, separate institutional setup with&#13;
representative of the Govermnent and water users or Farmers' Organizations should be considered for&#13;
enforcing groundwater regulations. In addition regulatory framework should have a mechanism for self-&#13;
management at the local level. The detailed institutional structure for implementation of regulations would&#13;
be developed during the project as part of the groundwater regulatory program.&#13;
III. DEVELOPMENT OF REGULATORY FRAMEWORK&#13;
7.            No work has been done in Pakistan about developing a regulatory framework to manage&#13;
the groundwater aquifer with falling water tables. This is due to the reason that until now rising and not&#13;
falling water tables were the major problem affecting the agricultural production. Considerable amount&#13;
of data gathering, modelling and analysis is needed before starting the enforcement of regulations&#13;
controlling the groundwater use. The program of developing regulation and their implementation would&#13;
consist of three phases; (i) in the first phase, the groundwater management areas will be established based&#13;
on the existing information ; (ii) in the second phase critical areas for groundwater management would&#13;
be identified, detailed data collection and monitoring would be carried out in the critical areas, and safe&#13;
yields of aquifers and groundwater rights would be determined; (iii) in the third phase a procedure for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-101-                                      Annex 5&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
regulating the groundwater use in each critical areas, and institutional structure would be developed.&#13;
8.     Establishment of Management Areas.        For ease in management of the groundwater basins&#13;
the groundwater aquifers in Punjab will be divided into different Groundwater Management areas, based&#13;
on existing data, and considering behavior and quality of groundwater aquifers, hydrological and&#13;
meteorological data, topographic and geological information, canal command areas, surface water&#13;
application, efficiency of use, and cropping patterns, etc. During this phase a database consisting of basic&#13;
information for each management areas would also be developed which will be updated on a continuous&#13;
basis. The sources of major aquifer recharge as well as extractions will be identified in each management&#13;
area. This phase would be completed in a period of one year.&#13;
9.     Establishing Critical Areas and Groundwater Rights.     In parallel to establishing the&#13;
Groundwater Management areas, the critical areas requiring extensive management would be identified.&#13;
The groundwater models would be developed, and calibrated to simulate the groundwater behavior over&#13;
a long period including wet and dry cycles. Using the simulation models and monitoring information,&#13;
rights to the groundwater will be established by distributary command area, watercourse command (chak)&#13;
and by farm. Detailed data collection will be carried out for calibration of the model, and developing a&#13;
database for eventual regulation of groundwater use for the critical areas. This phase will be completed&#13;
by the second year of the project.&#13;
10.    Procedures for Regulation and Institutional Structure.   In preparing the groundwater&#13;
regulation procedure the emphasis would be given to simple rules, and self regulating systems tested&#13;
around some pilot operations. Basing on the safe yields of the aquifer in the long run (considering wet&#13;
and dry cycles), pattern of groundwater water use in the critical areas, utilization rates of private,&#13;
community and public tubewells, estimates will be made for safe installed capacity by watercourse&#13;
command, as well as by distributaries. For foreseeable future the regulation will be based on the installed&#13;
capacity of the tubewells which will be correlated to the actual groundwater extractions through empirical&#13;
studies and simulation models. A program for licensing the groundwater tubewells with an objective&#13;
towards achieving safe installed capacity will be instituted. In issuing the tubewell licenses preference will&#13;
be give to community tubewells supplying to several users in chak. The detailed institutional setup for&#13;
groundwater management in each management area will vary depending upon the type and the severity&#13;
of the problem. Overall responsibility for regulation of groundwater would be given to an independent&#13;
body. This phase would be completed in third project year.&#13;
11.    Pilots for Groundwater Management.        As part of developing effective groundwater&#13;
regulation strategy a few pilots would be implemented before refining the regulation procedures. The&#13;
objectives of the pilots would be to test and evolve most effective methods for groundwater management,&#13;
assessment of the extent of regulation required, effectiveness of allocation and distribution of groundwater&#13;
rights, and roles of the regulating and monitoring agencies, surface water and drainage agencies, the&#13;
farmers and their organizations, local governments and NGOs in implementation of the groundwater&#13;
regulations.&#13;
12.   Implementation.       The implementation strategy for groundwater management would depend&#13;
on the type of groundwater problem in each management area. In areas where water table is still rising,&#13;
installation of community tubewells will be encouraged by forming effective FOs through social&#13;
mobilization programs, dissemination of the groundwater monitoring information to FOs and teaching&#13;
effective water conservation measures to reduce the surface water losses to the groundwater. In areas with&#13;
marginal quality groundwater, techniques of improved conjunctive use and saline irrigation would be&#13;
disseminated to the FOs. A complete solution would be developed in such areas as the capability of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-102-                          ~~~~~~~Annex 5&#13;
-102-                                   Page 5 of 5&#13;
FOs build up, its size becomes larger, covering more than a watercourse command (preferably a&#13;
distributary), major problems of inequity in surface water distribution are addressed (to some extent), as&#13;
well as provincial capability for regulation in these areas builds up.&#13;
13.          In areas where a balance have been achieved or water tables are falling, a program of&#13;
licensing the groundwater tubewells will be started during the last two years of the project. At the same&#13;
time, suitable mechanisms for increasing the recharge to the fresh groundwater aquifers would be&#13;
investigated. A comprehensive public information program would be developed outlining the current&#13;
groundwater situation and consequences if the present situation continues. Forming FOs would be a&#13;
condition for issuing tubewell licenses. For these areas a local as well as umbrella regulating agency&#13;
would be developed. Other important elements of regulation would include, development of self-&#13;
regulating systems, and regulation of drilling operations.&#13;
14.    Self Regulating Systems.    The best way to a create suitable environment for the development&#13;
self regulating system is to install community tubewells (CTWs) instead of individually owned tubewells.&#13;
With CTWs excessive installation could be avoided, taking better advantage of conjunctive surface and&#13;
groundwater use, and pumpage would be regulated by the availability and the capacity of the surface&#13;
system itself. In order to make the system fully self regulating the FOs should be large enough so that&#13;
over pumping or saline water intrusion has a direct impact on their cost of operation. This would be a&#13;
longer term objective and it has to be achieved through reforms in the surface water distribution systems,&#13;
where canal command level management would be entrusted to the Public Utilities and effective FOs&#13;
would be developed to management the O&amp;M of the distributary systems.&#13;
15.    Drilling Operations.  Licensing drillers could include a testing of the driller's knowledge of&#13;
tubewell drilling, requirements of regulatory agency and groundwater protection. To begin with as an&#13;
alternative to licensing the drillers, regulating agency would maintain a register of drillers in the&#13;
management area. In the longer run, however, the drillers would have to be licensed. In any event,&#13;
drillers would be required to provide certain information (depth, formations, depth to water, water samples,&#13;
etc.) to the regulatory agency for the continuing purpose of evaluating the groundwater basins.&#13;
16.    Permit to Install tubewell.   A permit to drill could be accommodated before the drilling&#13;
operation phase and a permit to withdraw handled later. However, in most cases a water user would&#13;
accomplish both prior to drilling. Permits could be conditioned on discharge capacity limits, depth to&#13;
water limit, size of casing, size of pump, and type electric or diesel. However, with the possibility of self-&#13;
regulation the FOR may want the individual users to measure or estimate pumping (keeping logbooks,&#13;
measuring drawdown, etc.). Tubewells for domestic, and livestock purposes would be exempted from&#13;
permits.&#13;

Punjab Private Sector Groundwater Development Project&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
for&#13;
Project Impact Evaluation (PIE)&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.            The Government of Pakistan (GOP) has requested the International Development&#13;
Association (IDA) for a Credit to meet part of the cost of the proposed Punjab Private Sector Groundwater&#13;
Development (PGD) Project.  The project is being implemented by the Government of Punjab&#13;
(GOPunjab). A Project Management Unit (PMU) in the Planning &amp; Development Board of GOPunjab&#13;
is responsible for overall project management and coordination. The Punjab Irrigation Department (PID)&#13;
and the Directorate Gieneral of Water Management (OFWM) in the Agricultural Departments are the co-&#13;
implementing agencies. These terms of reference are for professional and technical services in various&#13;
fields for carrying out project impact evaluation studies (PIES).&#13;
2.     Project Objectives.   The overall objectives of the PGD Project are to increase the scope and&#13;
productivity of Punjab's irrigation and drainage subsector and increase farmer's incomes. Its specific&#13;
objectives are to: (a) redefine government's role in groundwater development with a greater role for the&#13;
private sector; (b) develop a regulatory framework and a monitoring program to ensure sustainable use&#13;
of the groundwater resources; (c) develop sustainable farmers organizations (FOs) which can efficiently&#13;
operate and maintain groundwater irrigation, improve surface irrigation, and establish a base for&#13;
participation in the management of the canal systems; (d) rationalize public expenditure on O&amp;M of the&#13;
irrigation and drainage systems as well as increase the recovery of public expenditures on irrigation&#13;
infrastructure; and (e) avoid environmental hazard of saline water intrusioni into freshi grounidwater&#13;
aquifers.&#13;
3.     Project Description.  The proposed five-year (FY97-2001) project would cover the fresh&#13;
groundwater areas (FGW) of SCARP 11 (including Shahpur), SCARP Ill (Rangpur Unit), SCARP IV and&#13;
SCARP V (Shorkot Kamalia) located in administrative divisions of Sargodha, Gujranwala, Faisalabad, and&#13;
Lahore. It also includes saline groundwater (SGWs) areas within or at the boundaries of FGW areas. The&#13;
gross area is about 1.455 million ha of which about 1.193 million ha have FGW, while the CCA is about&#13;
1.292 million hectares of which about 1.068 million hectares have FGW. The major project components&#13;
are: (a) privatization of SCARP tubewells (STWs); (b) development of groundwater monitoring and&#13;
regulatory framework; (c) improvement of irrigation facilities in fresh groundwater areas, including&#13;
improvement of watercourses; (d) prevention of saline groundwater intrusion into fresh aquifers, including&#13;
rehabilitation of drainage tubewells, aild lining of watercourses in saline groundwater areas; (e) monitoring&#13;
and evaluation; (f) technical assistance and training; (g) project management and supervision.&#13;
4.            The proposed project will privatize approximately 4,200 SCARP tubewells (STWs)26.&#13;
The project will support the formation of FOs, and, through them, the establishment of privately operated&#13;
community tubewells (CTWs) to replace government-operated STWs throughout the project area. The&#13;
objective of this project activity is to develop FOs that can efficiently operate and maintain surface and&#13;
Ofwhich 2,458 STWs are located in SCARPs 11 and Shahpur, 1,001 in SCARP IV, 570 in SCARP III (Rangpur unit),&#13;

groundwater resources for irrigated agriculture in Punjab on a sustainable basis. To achieve this objective,&#13;
the project will support the development of a social mobilization program within the Project Management&#13;
Unit (PMU). The PMU will have overall responsibility for the project's social mobilization efforts&#13;
through a Community Development Support Group (CDSG) recruited as consultancy services. The CDSG&#13;
team will consist of: (a) core staff responsible for CDSG field staff training and management, and social&#13;
mobilization program coordination; and (b) field staff of Social Organizers (SOs) working with the help&#13;
of NGOs and village level social activists to mobilize farmer participation in project activities. CDSG will&#13;
have responsibility for the privatization of approximately 2,700, or two-thirds of the STWs targeted for&#13;
privatization. The CDSG will also be responsible for assisting the PID in promoting farmer&#13;
participation in canal lining, and watch and ward as well as O&amp;M of drainage tubewells&#13;
rehabilitated under the project. The Directorate of OFWM will be responsible for privatizing the&#13;
remaining 1,500 STWs in conjunction with a program of project-supported w/c improvement.&#13;
II. SCOPE OF PIE CONSULTING SERVICES&#13;
Description of Assignment&#13;
5.            The PMU will engage a consulting firm or an independent organization, following IDA&#13;
guidelines, to carry out project impact evaluation studies (PIES). The main objectives of PIES are to&#13;
evaluate the success in meeting the project objectives, and to assess its physical, agricultural, social,&#13;
financial/fiscal, and economic impact. The PIES would also provide independent and continuous feed&#13;
back to the implementing agencies on the project's performance and impact of its various components,&#13;
so that corrective action or fine tuning could be undertaken in a timely manner. The PIE studies would&#13;
include, but not be limited to, monitoring and evaluating the following:&#13;
a.     Physical Aspects:&#13;
i.    The capacity utilization of private tubewells (PTWs), and Community tubewells&#13;
(CTWs), the impact of the project on total groundwater abstraction, the&#13;
groundwater table and sustainability of aquifer;&#13;
ii.    the types, capacities, costs, and operating factors of STWs, PTWs, CTWs; and the&#13;
relative efficiencies of use of water from STWs, PTWs, and CTWs;&#13;
iii.   the nature and extent of water markets, seasonal variations in water sales by&#13;
PTWs and CTWs, and their relative impact on equity of groundwater distribution;&#13;
iv.    the impact on shallow as well as deep water quality and the sustainability of&#13;
groundwater use for agriculture;&#13;
v.    the impact on soil salinity (surface and profile);&#13;
vi.   the efficacy of the project interventions --canal and watercourse lining, and&#13;
rehabilitation of drainage wells-- in preventing saline water intrusion in fresh&#13;
groundwater aquifers; and&#13;
vii.   the impact of watercourse improvements on conveyance efficiencies and savings&#13;
of canal and CTWs water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

cropping patterns, intensities, and yields; and&#13;
v.     the impact of canal lining on reliability of surface water supplies, particularly in&#13;
the tail reaches.&#13;
c.     Sociological Aspects:&#13;
i.     Case studies and random monitoring of FOs would be carried out to assess:&#13;
(I)    their financial viability and sustainability prospects;&#13;
(2)    the equity of CTWs water distribution amongst members of FOs, and cost&#13;
sharing and O&amp;M arrangements;&#13;
(3)    the success or failure of FOs in operating and maintaining CTWs for the&#13;
benefit of all its members;&#13;
(4)    the impact on small farmers and contribution to poverty alleviation;&#13;
(5)    the size and composition of FOs benefiting from CTWs, and those that&#13;
rely on canal and canal pus PTWs water only, following the closure of&#13;
STWs;&#13;
(6)    the potential of FOs to play an increasing role in management of surface&#13;
water supplies, O&amp;M of watercourses, minor and distributary canals,&#13;
drainage tubewells, and small surface drains; and collection of canal&#13;
water charges.&#13;
ii.    the effectiveness of the project's approach to community mobilization and the&#13;
appropriateness, and timeliness (or otherwise) of the delivery of the project's&#13;
incentive package;&#13;
iii.   the performance of the community mobilization consultants, OFWM  staff, and&#13;
NGOs in establishing viable FOs;&#13;
iv.    the impact of transition from STWs to CTWs on the conjunctive use of canal and&#13;
groundwater for irrigation, and the consequences for water supply reliability for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

d.     Financial and Fiscal Aspects:&#13;
i.    the impact on the gross and net farm incomes of farmers, including both members&#13;
and non-members of FOs;&#13;
ii.    the capacity of farmers to pay their share of the costs of CTWs, watercourse&#13;
improvement, and canal lining;&#13;
iii.   the reduction in the fiscal burden of GOPunjab as a result of the privatization of&#13;
STWs; and&#13;
iv.    the effectiveness of the altemate use of the funds that become available as a result&#13;
of privatization of STWs (i.e whether or not saved funds have been allocated for&#13;
O&amp;M of canals).&#13;
e.     Economic Aspects:&#13;
i.    estimation of the project's overall economic rate of return (ERR) on "before and&#13;
after" as well as "with and without project" basis;&#13;
ii.    assessment of CTWs versus PTWs as the least cost solution to replacing the&#13;
STWs;&#13;
iii.   comparison of economic costs of water pumped by PTWs and CTWs;&#13;
iv.    assessment of prospects of long term sustainability of fresh groundwater aquifers&#13;
in the "with" and "without" project scenarios; and&#13;
v.     assessment of the secondary impact of the project on economic activity in the&#13;
project area.&#13;
Study Methodology&#13;
6.            The PIE consultants would make the best use of the MIS and data base developed by the&#13;
PMU and PIA consultants. However, they would be responsible for developing their own data base for&#13;
appropriate key indicators of the project's impact. They would, augment the PIA consultants' data base,&#13;
as necessary, through field observations and studies. The PIE consultants would develop their own&#13;
methodology for monitoring and evaluating the impact of various project components. This will include&#13;
design, development, testing, and operationalizing a system for monitoring and evaluating the project&#13;
impact.&#13;

C. Implementation Arrangements&#13;
3.     General.     The project would be implemented by a Project Management Unit (PMU) in the&#13;
Punjab Planning and Development (P&amp;D) Department, Punjab Irrigation (PID), Agriculture (PAD), and&#13;
FOs in collaboration with WAPDA. The existing Provincial Policy Committee (PPC) and the Project&#13;
Coordination Committees (PCC) established under the ongoing Second SCARP Transition Project would&#13;
provide policy guidance, assist with inter-Departmental coordination, and hold periodic reviews of progress&#13;
at the provincial and field levels, respectively. The proposed organization is shown in Charts I and 2,&#13;
and the roles of implementing agencies are described below.&#13;
4.     The Project management Unit (PMU).       The PMU would have minimal staff only for the&#13;
duration of the project and it would be supported mainly by the consultants. PMU would be composed&#13;
of a full time Project Director (PD), two ex-officio Members (one each from PID and the Directorate&#13;
General of Water Management (DGWM), and three Directors as well as support staff. The Directors&#13;
would be recruited from the open market or supplied by a management consulting firms on fixed-term&#13;
contracts for the duration of the project. The PD would be a senior official of the P&amp;D Board of the level&#13;
of Member of the Board. The PMU would be supported by a multi-disciplinary team of consultants who&#13;
would provide project implementation assistance (PIA) in project management, community mobilization,&#13;
engineering design and construction supervision, and development of groundwater regulatory framework&#13;
(terms of reference are in Annex 3). The PMU would also employ an independent organization or&#13;
consulting firm to carry out project impact evaluation studies (PIES) (TOR are in Annex 6).&#13;
5.    The PD PMN  would be responsible for overseeing overall project implementation. The Director&#13;
[MIS, Administration, Budget and Accounts (MABA)I would be an experienced Chartered Accountant&#13;
(or equivalent) with experience in maintaining an MIS, administration, preparation of budgets and&#13;
maintenance of accounts. With the assistance of the MIS, as well as budget and accounts specialist&#13;
supplied by the PIA consultants, the Director (MABA) would establish an MIS for the project and submit&#13;
periodic progress reports on all project components to PMU, and IDA, be responsible for administrative&#13;
matters relating to the PMU, and prepare annual budgets and requests for appropriation of funds in the&#13;
Annual Development Programs.  The Director [Community Development (CD)] would be a&#13;
sociologist/anthropologist with experience in community mobilization and participatory irrigation&#13;
management, preferably in groundwater management. With the assistance of the CDSG teamn supplied&#13;
by the PIA consultants, the Director (CD) would, inter alia, be responsible for managing and supervising&#13;
the operations of the project's four field offices, the CDSG team of PIA consultants, and the NGOs&#13;
involved in community mobilization, maintaining consistency of community mobilization methodology&#13;
and approach followed by the PIA consultants, OFWM  field teams and NGOs.  The Director&#13;
[Regulation] would be a groundwater specialist with experience in legal aspects of groundwater&#13;
management and regulation, as well as monitoring and evaluation of groundwater projects. The main&#13;
responsibilities of this position would include managing and supervising the PIE consultants, and the PIA&#13;
consultants team responsible for developing groundwater regulatory framework.&#13;
6.    The PID through the Member (Irrigation) of PMU, would be responsible for STWs closures&#13;
and retrieval of machinery from the boreholes and their capping (this would be done through open&#13;
auctions), canal rehabilitation/lining, drainage rehabilitation, performance contracts for O&amp;M, and re-&#13;
deployment of redundant staff. For this purpose, PID would put all the SCARPs included in the project,&#13;
and one canal construction division under the jurisdiction of the Member (Irrigation). The PAD,&#13;
through the Directorate General of Water Management, would be responsible for improving&#13;
watercourses, and establishing FOs and CTWs in designated areas. The DG Water Management would&#13;
designate a Project Manager, and assign four Area and twenty five Field teams to carry out these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-127-                                      Annex 9&#13;
Page 3 of 14&#13;
activities. The Member (Water Management) would, inter alia. be responsible for: (i) ensuring close&#13;
coordination between the PMU and the Directorate General of Water Management; (ii) drafting necessary&#13;
bye laws for WUAs and FOs to allow ownership and/or leasing of CTWs/land; and (iii) preparing&#13;
innovative designs for layout of CTWs so that they could be installed on the public land along the&#13;
watercourses.&#13;
7.     NGO's Role.   Currently there are no NGOs in Punjab with experience in establishing FOs and&#13;
capable of assuming full responsibility for managing an extensive social mobilization program needed for&#13;
the project. However, some local service NGOs have working relationships with local community based&#13;
organizations CBOs and/or local activists who could help mobilize farmer participation in the project.&#13;
Wherever feasible, the PMU will seek cooperation of local service NGOs and CBOs either directly or&#13;
through the PIA consultants to assist with community mobilization. In selecting NGOs/CBOs, it would&#13;
be ensured that they: (a) are legally registered and maintain accounts that are audited annually; (b) are&#13;
involved in the rural development as their main objective and they are not affiliated with any political&#13;
organization; (c) have adequate number of field staff conversant with local languages and customs, and&#13;
have good knowledge and understanding of the socio-economic conditions in the area; and (d) are&#13;
supportive of the project objectives and can work in harmony with the rest of the project team.&#13;
8.     FO's Role.    FO's would play a critical role in project implementation. They would be eligible&#13;
for receiving project assistance for establishing CTWs if they have membership of at least one-third of&#13;
the farmers within the command of an STW. FOs wishing to establish CTWs would be required to&#13;
register themselves as a water users association or its sub-group (e.g. a tubewell committee) under the&#13;
Punjab Water Users Associations Ordinance of 1981. The FOs at the CTW level would, inter alia, have&#13;
the following responsibilities: (a) interacting with the field tearns of PMU and/or OFWM staff to prepare&#13;
work plans for transfer of STWs; (b) determining the best option for replacing STW pumpage, in terms&#13;
of type, size and location of CTWs; (c) installing, operating and maintaining CTW, and distributing water&#13;
to its members according to agreed shares and schedules; (d) maintaining bank accounts and collecting&#13;
members' share of capital, operation and maintenance and replacement costs; (e) maintaining capital and&#13;
O&amp;M accounts and log books; (f) improving water management in the watercourse command; and (f)&#13;
participating in watercourse and canal improvement programs.&#13;
9.            Watercourses would be improved in areas where the majority of farrmers on a watercourse&#13;
agree to cooperate and manage water deliveries at the chak level. In fresh groundwater areas these FOs&#13;
would qualify for project assistance for watercourse improvements after they have effectively operated and&#13;
maintained their CTWs for a period of one year. During this period they would: (i) elect their executive&#13;
committee, including a Chairman, a General Secretary, and a Treasurer; (ii) improve distribution of canal&#13;
as well as CTW water, and the community and farn channels; (iii) open a bank account, generate funds&#13;
for up-front contribution for W/C improvement, from sales of CTW water and contributions from FO&#13;
members; (iv) collect farmers' shares for repayment of material costs to the government; and (v)&#13;
participate in improving water distribution at the distributary level, and collecting contributions for the&#13;
capital cost of improving distributaries.&#13;
10.    WAPDA's Role.        WAPDA would provide electric connections to FOs who are close to&#13;
electric supply and decide to install electric CTWs. Where STWs are converted to CTWs as such under&#13;
the transfer mode, WAPDA will transfer the title of electrical connection to FOs against normally needed&#13;
security deposits. WAPDA would also assist FOs in removing electrical equipment and wiring no longer&#13;
needed.&#13;

Project Coordination Committee&#13;
11.                 At the project level, an existing Project Coordination Committee (PCC) would be&#13;
responsible for ensuring coordination among various agencies and facilitating project implementation. The&#13;
PCC would be chaired by PD of PMU and have the following members: (i) from PID: SE's of concerned&#13;
SCARP, canal and drainage Circles; (ii) from the PAD: the Area Coordinator of OFWM; and the Deputy&#13;
Director Agriculture; (iii) a representative of District Administration; and (iv) representatives of selected&#13;
FOs. The PCC would meet once every month. The PMU would also act as its secretariat.&#13;
Provincial Policy Committee&#13;
12.                 The existing Provincial Policy Committee (PPC) would provide policy guidance&#13;
and steer project implementation by providing inter-agency coordination at the highest level. The PPC&#13;
would be chaired by the Chairman P&amp;D Board and the Secretaries of Irrigation, Agriculture, and Finance&#13;
would be its members. The PD of PMU would act as its secretary. The PPC would meet at least every&#13;
six months, or whenever issues requiring resolution are submitted for its consideration. The main&#13;
functionls of the PPC would be to: (i) resolve issues not settled by the PCC; (ii) ensure provision of&#13;
adequate budgetary allocations for project implementation as well as operation and maintenance (O&amp;M);&#13;
(iii) ensure adequacy and continuity of PMU staff; (iv) ensure that the project complies with legal&#13;
covenanits; and (v) recruit and supervise consultants to carry out full supervision of the project twice a&#13;
year, independently of the PMU.&#13;
C. Implementation Schedule&#13;
13.          A summary of implementation schedule for the project is given in Table 1. Details by&#13;
project components is given in their respective sections and annexes. A summary description is give&#13;
below.&#13;
14.    Documents Processing and Approvals.      The project was jointly appraised by IDA and&#13;
FAO/CP in June/July, 1995. The Yellow cover was finalized in December, 1995. The credit negotiations&#13;
with would be held in April, 1996 and the project is expected to be approved by Board in May, 1996.&#13;
On the Government side the preparation of PC-I started in November, 1996 and approved by the Punjab,&#13;
Irrigation, Agriculture departments in February, 1996. The P&amp;D would process the PC-I and submit for&#13;
the approval of the Provincial Development Working Party (PDWP) in April, 1996. The PDWP approval&#13;
would be obtain in May, 1996. The ECNEC would give full approval of PC- I by September 30, 1996.&#13;
15.    Recruitment of Consulting Services. The short-list of consulting firms for the project&#13;
implementation have been completed by the PMU and cleared by IDA. The Letter of Invitation for&#13;
technical and financial proposals have been launched on March 3, 1996. The proposals would be&#13;
submitted by the short-listed firms by March 18, 1996. The evaluation of the technical and financial&#13;
proposals would be completed by the May 31, 1996. The consultants selections would be completed and&#13;
a consultancy contact would be signed by June 30, 1996. The consultants would mobilize in July, 1996&#13;
and establishment of the field offices would be completed by October 30, 1996.&#13;
16.          For recruitment of M&amp;E consultants, in December, 1995 the Government have invited&#13;
expression of interest from the consulting firms for preparation of a long-list. The short-list would be&#13;
completed by April 15, 1996. Technical and financial proposals from the short-listed firms would be&#13;
invited by June 30, 1996 after IDA clearance of the invitation package. The consultants selection would&#13;
&#13;

Annex 9&#13;
-129-                                 Page 5 of 14&#13;
be completed November 30, 1996 and the consultants would mobilize and establish the field offices by&#13;
December 31, 1996.&#13;
17.    Procurement of Vehicles and Equipment.   Contrary  to  previous project in  Pakistan,&#13;
procurement of all vehicles and equipment needed for the project would be procured by one agency, PMU&#13;
through a single bid package. The package would be launched well in advance so the vehicles and&#13;
equipment would be available at the time of mobilization of staff and the consultants. The procurement&#13;
package have been prepared with several sub-packages consisting of homogeneous items. The package&#13;
would be launched by March 31, 1996 and the supply contracts would be signed by June 31, 1996. The&#13;
procuremenit would be completed by September 30, 1996.&#13;
18.    Disinvestment of SCARP Tubewells. All field offices would begin to function fully by&#13;
December, 1996/January 1997. All the social mobilization staff both field and headquarter would start&#13;
functioning by January 31, 1997 except the social organizers who will be recruited as required by the&#13;
speed of implementation. In the first fiscal year only 20 SOs would be in place the number would&#13;
increase to 60 or more (as needed) in the following years. By June, 1997 about 800 FOs would be&#13;
formed for installation of CTWs and about 200 STWs would be replaced with 300 CTWs. In project&#13;
years (PY) two to four about 1,590 CTWs would be installed annually and target of 6,360 would be&#13;
completed in project year 5.&#13;
19.    Watercourse (W/C) Improvements.  In fresh groundwater area the about 400 watercourse level&#13;
FOs would be formed by June 30, 1997. Watercourse improvements in fresh area would start from the&#13;
second year of the project on watercourse where CTWs have worked successfully for one year. It is&#13;
estimated that about 100 W/Cs would be improved in PY2. The number would increase to 300 in PY3,&#13;
600 in PY4 and 500 in the last year. In the saline areas the OFWM staff will concentrate on developing&#13;
W/C level FOs in the first project year. In the PY2 about 50 watercourse would be improved, about 200&#13;
in PY3 and PY4, and about 50 in PY5.&#13;
20.    Canal Improvements. Preparation of detailed canal designs would start in January, 1996 and&#13;
would be completed by November 30, 1997. The tender documents would be finalized by December 31,&#13;
1997. The bids would be invited through ICB in January, 1998 and the work would start in July, 1998.&#13;
About 30 percent of the works would be completed in PY3 followed by 40 and 30 percent in PY4 and&#13;
PY S.&#13;
21.    Drainage Works.    About 10 saline tubewells would be rehabilitated in the saline unit of&#13;
SCARP-II in PY3 and remaining 15 in PY4.&#13;
D. Key Performance Indicators&#13;
22.           The performance indicators which would be monitored during the project implementation&#13;
to evaluate the performance of the project are classified in four groups, the input indicators, the output&#13;
indicators, process indicators and the impact indicators. These would be monitored by the PMU through&#13;
field visits and observations, third party supervision missions, and the monitoring and evaluation studies.&#13;
The IDA missions would also monitor these indicator during field visits project supervision missions. The&#13;
summary of key indicators are provided in Table 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Annex 9&#13;
-130-                                  Page 6 of 14&#13;
E. Supervision Plan&#13;
IDA Supervision Input and Key Activities.&#13;
23.           IDA would supervise the project twice a year on average. If required supervision would&#13;
occur more frequently during the first two years to help steer it through the start-up stage. The project&#13;
launchi and procurement workshops would also be organized during this period. The IDA supervision&#13;
would comprise of one main supervision mission annually in the second semester of the fiscal year,&#13;
supplemented by a shorter mission in the first semester, and correspondence and clearances as needed.&#13;
Intensity of supervision missions would be reduced after the project is successfully past this start-up stage,&#13;
and a regime of enihanced Government has been established. Intensive IDA supervision during the start-up&#13;
stage is justified given the nature of the project, which unlike conventional irrigation projects, is&#13;
"software" intensive rather than "hardware" intensive. Community mobilization is a crucial element of&#13;
the project. This is a relatively new area in irrigation projects in Pakistan and requires greater supervision&#13;
inputs by IDA. Table 3 contains IDA's proposed supervision plan, and details of staff inputs and skill&#13;
mix requirements for supervision missions. IDA supervision would be facilitated by the proposed&#13;
arrangemenits for enhanced Government supervision.&#13;
Borrowers Contribution to Supervision&#13;
24.           The PMU would have a lead role in supervision the project implementation, and&#13;
responsible for ensuring that all project components are appropriately monitored, based on the key&#13;
indicators and regularly measured to give an idea of the project's impact and success in meeting its&#13;
objectives. The PMU would have primary responsibility for re-directing and restructuring of the project,&#13;
chaniginig the levels and types of inputs, and processes to ensure that the project objectives are met and&#13;
implemenitationi proceeds smoothly and according to the schedule. The PMU would make use of the&#13;
moniitoring and evaluation studies, Management Information Systems and budgeting and accounting&#13;
meclianiisins and third party supervision for rigorous superior of the project.&#13;
25.    Third Party Supervision.    In line with the decision taken during the 1995 Country Portfolio&#13;
Perfornmance Review (CPPR), the project provides resources to support enhanced project supervision by&#13;
GOPunjab. The P&amp;D Board would hire, independently of the PMU, services of specialists in various&#13;
fields to carry out detailed supervision of the project on behalf of GOPunjab from time to time (on&#13;
average two times a year) and submit detailed supervision reports. TOR of these specialists as well as&#13;
their reports would be shared with IDA.&#13;
26.    Annual Work Plans and Progress Reporting.        The MIS of the PMU would be designed&#13;
to meet the monitoring and reporting requirements of all project components. The PIA consultants would&#13;
identify the key progress indicators and design an appropriate MIS system, including an "issues and&#13;
actions oriented" progress reporting format acceptable to the PMU and IDA. The PMU, with inputs from&#13;
PID and PAD, would also prepare detailed annual plans/work programs and budgets, as well as requests&#13;
for allocation of funds in the federal/provincial annual development programs. The annual plans would&#13;
duly take into account feedback from project impact evaluation studies. The PID and PAD would submit&#13;
monthly progress reports to the PMU. The PMU in turn would integrate them and submit periodic&#13;
progress reports covering all project components to the P&amp;D Board, PID, PAD and IDA. The PMU&#13;
would also periodically prepare working papers for the PCC and PPC meetings. Assurances would be&#13;
obtained that by March 31 each year, the PMU would submit to IDA for its review, a draft Annual Plan,&#13;
including work program and the proposed budgetary allocation for the following fiscal year, cleared by&#13;
the PPC.&#13;

27.    Project Launch Workshop. To facilitate project start-up. the PMU in collaboration with PID&#13;
and PAD, would hold a project launch workshop soon after Credit signing (in early FY97). The&#13;
workshop would, inter alia, familiarize project staff (as well as officials of concerned implementing and&#13;
cooperating agencies) with the project objectives, components, implementation schedule and institutional&#13;
arrangements, procurement and disbursement procedures, and monitoring and evaluation aspects of the&#13;
project.&#13;
28.    Procurement Workshops.    Several procurement workshops would be conducted to provide&#13;
assistance in the procurement planning, the use of Banks Standard Bidding document, preparation of bid&#13;
documents, evaluation of bids and award of contracts. These workshops would be organized to train local&#13;
staff in procurement with the aim to enhance general capability in this area and, in addition to the project&#13;
staff will be open to staff of other agencies involved in procurement under large projects.&#13;
29.    Mid-Term Review.   To evaluate the project's progress, and prospects of meeting its objectives,&#13;
a detailed mid-term review (MTR) would be carried out jointly by GOPunjab, GOP and IDA during the&#13;
third year of implementation, not latter than March 31, 1999.  The MTR would evaluate the overall&#13;
progress and assess need for adjustments in the project scope and design, implementation approach and&#13;
methodology, and policy aspects, to ensure timely completion and achievement of project objectives. The&#13;
PMU would submit draft TOR for the MTR for the P&amp;D Board's and IDA's review by September 30,&#13;
1998, and an MTR Preparation Report compiled with the assistance of the PIA and PIE consultants, or&#13;
other specialists by January 31, 1999.&#13;

            Pakistan - Punjab Private Sector
            Groundwater Development Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall objectives of the Punjab
            Private Sector Groundwater Development Project are to
            increase the scope and productivity of Punjab's
            irrigation and drainage subsector and increase farmers'
            incomes. The specific objectives are to: (a) redefine
            Government's role in groundwater development and
            provide assistance to facilitate change; (b) develop a
            monitoring program and regulatory framework to ensure
            sustainable use of the groundwater resources; (c) develop
            sustainable farmers' organizations; (d) increase
            beneficiaries' incomes and alleviate poverty; (e)
            rationalize public expenditure on operation and management
            of the irrigation and drainage systems as well as increase
            the recovery of public expenditures on irrigation
            infrastructure; and (f) avoid environmental hazard of saline
            water intrusion into fresh groundwater aquifers. The project
            covering a large part of fresh groundwater Salinity Control
            and Reclamation Project (SCARP) areas in Punjab will be
            implemented over a period of five years. The major
            components are: (a) disinvestment of SCARP tubewells; (b)
            development of a groundwater monitoring and regulatory
            framework; (c) improvement of irrigation conveyance
            facilities; (d) prevention of saline groundwater intrusion
            in fresh aquifers; (e) monitoring and evaluation of the
            project; and (f) project management, and technical
            assistance and training.
