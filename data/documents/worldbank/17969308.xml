                         E. PATRICK COADY&#13;
                             Interview&#13;
                         Volume I - Tape A&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     MR. BECKER:     I'm William Becker, from George Washington&#13;
&#13;
University, and also the Business History Group.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. MILOBSKY:     I'm David Milobsky, from the World Bank&#13;
&#13;
History Office.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:     I'm Pat Coady, the United States Executive&#13;
&#13;
Director of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   Mr. Coady, we'd like to begin by asking how you&#13;
&#13;
came to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:     I was in town after the Bush election and&#13;
&#13;
one of my former partners, Nicholas Brady, was Secretary of&#13;
&#13;
the Treasury at the time.     He asked me to join the&#13;
&#13;
Administration in late 1988.     Based on some conversations&#13;
&#13;
with him, I agreed to put myself forward as a potential U.S.&#13;
&#13;
Executive Director at the World Bank.     Part of the reason for&#13;
&#13;
my interest in the Bank had to do with the firm I worked for&#13;
&#13;
in Wall street, Dillon, Read &amp; Co.     Dillon Read had a long&#13;
&#13;
history of public service in Washington, so you couldn't be&#13;
&#13;
around the firm for very long without having some interest in&#13;
&#13;
a position like the USED.     One of my mentors was a fellow&#13;
&#13;
named Peter Flanigan, who was in the Nixon Administration.&#13;
&#13;
James Forestal, the first Secretary of Defense, had been&#13;
&#13;
president of Dillon, Read. Douglas Dillon had been Secretary&#13;
&#13;
of the Treasury.     There was a sense that this was something&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Coady, Page 2&#13;
&#13;
which you did, so when Brady asked me, I was predisposed to&#13;
&#13;
take the job.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:    Had you followed issues related to the World Bank?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:    No, not directly.   My career had taken a&#13;
&#13;
turn toward the international side in late '69, mostly toward&#13;
&#13;
work in Japan, Korea and the Philippines, and I had probably&#13;
&#13;
spent somewhere between fifty and a hundred percent of my&#13;
&#13;
time on international merchant banking.      From '66 through the&#13;
&#13;
early '80s I had had a large dose of international merchant&#13;
&#13;
banking.   Most of my contact with the World Bank was usually&#13;
&#13;
through a series of dinners hosted by Dillon, Read during the&#13;
&#13;
annual meetings.    When I worked on the first public bond&#13;
&#13;
issue for Brazil and the first private financing in Korea,&#13;
&#13;
the Bank was a natural place to come to capture information.&#13;
&#13;
These activities aside, I really had very little&#13;
&#13;
understanding of the World Bank, and I'd say no understanding&#13;
&#13;
of the IFC at that point in time.      I didn't think that the&#13;
&#13;
IFC was someone the private sector could work with.      That had&#13;
&#13;
been one of the best kept secrets.     I think investment banks,&#13;
&#13;
at that point i~ time, were principally focused on the World&#13;
&#13;
Bank as a source of credit enhancement.     They were trying to&#13;
&#13;
take advantage of the Bank's guarantee.       I didn't have much&#13;
&#13;
contact with the Bank on policy issues. I didn't have much of&#13;
&#13;
a relationship with the World Bank.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                           Coady, Page 3&#13;
&#13;
     Q:      Before taking the position here, you had moved to&#13;
&#13;
Washington with your own company, Coady &amp; Co., and also The&#13;
&#13;
Acacia Group?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:           No.   I had had my own boutique investment&#13;
&#13;
bank together with a fellow who used to be a partner at&#13;
&#13;
Goldman, Sachs.           But that was in the world Trade Center in&#13;
&#13;
New York--&#13;
&#13;
     Q:      I see.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:           --through 1985.   One of our clients that we&#13;
&#13;
picked up was The Acacia Group.             I had done a number of&#13;
&#13;
acquisitions for them, one of them being the Calvert group of&#13;
&#13;
mutual funds here in town.            As a result of that work, The&#13;
&#13;
Acacia Group recruited me to be their Chief Financial&#13;
&#13;
Officer.     So I joined them in '85, and worked with The Acacia&#13;
&#13;
Group til early       1&#13;
                          89.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:      The Acacia Group was also located in New York?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:           No.   They were located here.   I came to&#13;
&#13;
Washington in 1985 to work for The Acacia Group.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:      I see.        Now, we'd like to turn to some questions&#13;
&#13;
about relationships with groups of people in other parts of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank.     The first thing we'd like to ask about is your&#13;
&#13;
dual role as the representative of the United States within&#13;
&#13;
the Bank and also as a spokesman to the U.S. for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
I'd like to know a little bit about how you perceive these&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                           Coady, Page 4&#13;
&#13;
responsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:       Well, I think the dominant force at work&#13;
&#13;
here is the realization of the unique position of the United&#13;
&#13;
States in the Bank.         In preparing for this job that position&#13;
&#13;
became even more clear.        The   u.s.    was prominent in the&#13;
&#13;
founding of the Bank.        The tradition is to have a U.S.&#13;
&#13;
president.     The   us   is the largest shareholder of the Bank. I&#13;
&#13;
tried to grasp what that meant.             To me, becoming an ED meant&#13;
&#13;
inheriting a special set of responsibilities for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Some of them were not always pleasant.             I had to be both the&#13;
&#13;
Bank's best friend and best critic.             You end up with&#13;
&#13;
schizophrenia, because without         u.s.    leadership, it's hard for&#13;
&#13;
the Bank to change.        The Bank resists change.       Unless there&#13;
&#13;
is some force applied, nothing happens.             I think that this is&#13;
&#13;
often interpreted by many others--other Directors, other&#13;
&#13;
countries--as a form of heavy-handedness.             such feelings are&#13;
&#13;
nothing new.     There has been a long history of tension&#13;
&#13;
between the US and the Bank's other member countries.               This&#13;
&#13;
was especially true during the Reagan era, when the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
inherent value was questioned.          As USED, I've tried to come&#13;
&#13;
to grips with these sentiments while remaining aware of the&#13;
&#13;
United States' uniquely global views and responsibilities.                 I&#13;
&#13;
found borrowing countries felt a certain obligation to be&#13;
&#13;
less vocal, for fear of compromising their relationship with&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Coady, Page 5&#13;
&#13;
the staff.     Thus I discovered very quickly that half the&#13;
&#13;
Board was silent on most issues--most contentious issues--&#13;
&#13;
many of the other Board members and countries have very&#13;
&#13;
regional policy interests.     On issues of financial policy or&#13;
&#13;
lending strategies and disciplines, I think that if the       u.s.&#13;
didn't speak up there would be less attention to those&#13;
&#13;
issues.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:      Now, on the question of your role within the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
Government, did you ever feel that you had to defend the Bank&#13;
&#13;
to the U.S. officials that you dealt with?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:     The principal interlocutories for me at the&#13;
&#13;
U.S. Treasury and the people that work with the Bank are&#13;
&#13;
familiar with the Bank.     The committees of Congress, however&#13;
&#13;
critical and constrictive and cantankerous they may be, know&#13;
&#13;
the Bank.     In some cases they knew it better than I did.&#13;
&#13;
They took trips and they met with staff.     There are channels&#13;
&#13;
that don't go through this office, so there are many people&#13;
&#13;
who know the Bank very well.     I'd say at that point in time&#13;
&#13;
the only group that really had to be dealt with in a very&#13;
&#13;
practical way was the environmental community and their&#13;
&#13;
surrogates in the U.S. Government.     They were the most&#13;
&#13;
critical of the Bank, and they had a lot of reasons to be&#13;
&#13;
critical.     We spent a lot of time dealing with that issue.&#13;
&#13;
I'd also say that the traditional agencies of government that&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Coady, Page 6&#13;
&#13;
work with the Bank, the Treasury, the State Department, AID,&#13;
&#13;
all have long working relationships.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:     So you didn't see your role as an advocate for the&#13;
&#13;
Bank with those critics?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:     No.   Congress was a little funny, because&#13;
&#13;
one of my first meetings as ED was with Ed Fried, one of my&#13;
&#13;
predecessors here at the Bank. I asked him a whole variety of&#13;
&#13;
questions: what his priorities were; what was important for&#13;
&#13;
him when he was here; and how he spent his time.      I was&#13;
&#13;
really taken aback by the fact that he said he spent&#13;
&#13;
somewhere between thirty and forty percent of his time on&#13;
&#13;
Capitol Hill.     And that was neither the sense I had from my&#13;
&#13;
immediate predecessors nor from the way the issues were&#13;
&#13;
evolving for me.     I had discovered that he felt a distinct&#13;
&#13;
responsibility to sell the Bank on Capitol Hill and Ed spent&#13;
&#13;
a huge amount of time doing that.      I haven't felt the same&#13;
&#13;
obligation.     In fact, I wasn't really invited to the Hill by&#13;
&#13;
the legislative affairs people at Treasury.      I also&#13;
&#13;
discovered that there was a very small group of people on&#13;
&#13;
Capitol Hill that were really experts on the Bank, and no one&#13;
&#13;
else in either house really wanted to be an expert on it.&#13;
&#13;
The committees were, in fact, the congressional spokesmen for&#13;
&#13;
the Bank.     Whatever the dynamic was at Ed Fried's time, it&#13;
&#13;
wasn't really there for me.     The Treasury had their own&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Coady, Page 7&#13;
&#13;
mechanisms to sell The Hill, and the traditional agencies&#13;
&#13;
were used to dealing with the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   Did you ever have difficulty trying to define where&#13;
&#13;
all these different boundaries between these different&#13;
&#13;
agencies lay?     Was there any sort of an adjustment process&#13;
&#13;
for you as you tried to find the right position between&#13;
&#13;
Treasury and State and the appropriate governmental agencies?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:     No, because the official channel of the   u.s.&#13;
Government is the Treasury and the agencies' official channel&#13;
&#13;
is the Treasury.     Occasionally people kind of wander off the&#13;
&#13;
reservation, but if they get caught there are usually some&#13;
&#13;
real reprimands involved. In addition, I went out of my way&#13;
&#13;
on projects to invite agencies in, reach out to interested&#13;
&#13;
parties and build bridges.     I think we've tried to set a&#13;
&#13;
different tone here, but, in fact, the processes of policy&#13;
&#13;
making, whether it's on individual loans or policies, was&#13;
&#13;
pretty well established when I arrived.     Treasury runs a&#13;
&#13;
weekly meeting for all agencies on loans, and that's the&#13;
&#13;
official forum for all lending issues.     On policy papers, I&#13;
&#13;
host meetings arid invite people in to give their views.      For&#13;
&#13;
AID, we host meetings, but that organization has their own&#13;
&#13;
direct channels at the Bank.    A lot of these channels are&#13;
&#13;
pretty well established.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   Who did you work with most closely at Treasury?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Coady, Page 8&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:     Well, I think one of the complications of&#13;
&#13;
this job is that you have to work closely with a lot of&#13;
&#13;
people, and that's a real unresolved problem.      The person I&#13;
&#13;
work most closely with is the World Bank Desk Officer at&#13;
&#13;
Treasury.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:      And who is that?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:     Well, right now it's a fellow named Brian&#13;
&#13;
Crowe.    He used to be in my office here.    He had been here&#13;
&#13;
about five years, and then went over to take his current job.&#13;
&#13;
The chain of command at Treasury, in my view, is not very&#13;
&#13;
efficient.     There is an Office Director, a Deputy Assistant&#13;
&#13;
Secretary, an Assistant Secretary, an under secretary.         Then&#13;
&#13;
there's the Secretary, and a Deputy Secretary.      If there's a&#13;
&#13;
contentious issue, or a very important issue, they all may&#13;
&#13;
have different views.     They don't talk to each other very&#13;
&#13;
efficiently.     It's a real problem.   On day to day stuff,&#13;
&#13;
however, the Desk Officer is the channel to the rest of them.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:      On a big issue, then, how do you get some reading&#13;
&#13;
of the U.S. Government's position on something, if all these&#13;
&#13;
people disagree?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:     Well, in my early days I tried to honor the&#13;
&#13;
system, which meant working with the Desk Officer to put&#13;
&#13;
together a decision memo which eventually floated up the&#13;
&#13;
chain.    After about a month of that, I discovered that&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Coady, Page 9&#13;
&#13;
nothing ever got out of people's "In" boxes,       so I tried a&#13;
&#13;
different approach.       I judiciously toured the chain of&#13;
&#13;
command, talking to people and learning who had the greatest&#13;
&#13;
interest in a particular issue the furthest up the line.          The&#13;
&#13;
next step was to call him up and say, "This thing needs&#13;
&#13;
someone's attention.      Here's what it is, and there's a memo&#13;
&#13;
down there if you want to chase it."&#13;
&#13;
     Q:    Sounds like the University.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:    Yes.    It sounds like any organization.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:    Speaking about the Board, I'd like to turn inward&#13;
&#13;
again.    You mentioned that half the Board was silent, and I'd&#13;
&#13;
like to ask you some questions about how the Board works.          To&#13;
&#13;
an outsider, it's quite remarkable that the Board seems to&#13;
&#13;
have the degree of consensus that it has, when one considers&#13;
&#13;
the divisions between the G-3 and the G-7 and the G-10, not&#13;
&#13;
to mention the numerous ideological and regional differences.&#13;
&#13;
How does the Board reach consensus?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:    It's rare to have a confrontation in the&#13;
&#13;
Board, and there is this tradition of consensus at the Board.&#13;
&#13;
Now, one of the~Â·reasons that this can be sustained is that,&#13;
&#13;
on contentious issues, there is a lot of discussion between&#13;
&#13;
Management and Directors, and among Directors, in order to&#13;
&#13;
find a middle ground early on.       In other words, the real&#13;
&#13;
debate takes place over the weeks and months prior to the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Coady, Page 10&#13;
&#13;
evolution of the issue.     There 1 s usually a history to it as&#13;
&#13;
well, whether it is a debate over the amount of reserves, or&#13;
&#13;
what amounts is required for loan provisioning.           There's a&#13;
&#13;
whole background to each ED's position and all these forces&#13;
&#13;
become transformed and compromised over time.           I would say&#13;
&#13;
Management is probably an expert at     11&#13;
                                             divide and conquer. 11   on&#13;
&#13;
many issues, the   u.s.   is isolated and we might be out voted.&#13;
&#13;
Some issues are resolved expeditiously, but others may go&#13;
&#13;
unresolved until the time of a capital increase because&#13;
&#13;
that's the time that you have more control.          Conversely, if&#13;
&#13;
there are issues where the donor countries mobilize in a very&#13;
&#13;
concerted way, they can generate changes.          I'd say Management&#13;
&#13;
is really an expert at dividing, conquering and compromising.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:     You've mentioned that you oftentimes found yourself&#13;
&#13;
isolated.   How would you typically find yourself in that&#13;
&#13;
position?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:    We might have a loan that we oppose, and we&#13;
&#13;
are unsuccessful in either having it put on the shelf for&#13;
&#13;
restructuring or whatever else.     Eventually, it ends up going&#13;
&#13;
to the Board and we may be active ourselves in trying to get&#13;
&#13;
other people to join us in our position.          If it's a loan,&#13;
&#13;
there are very few exceptions to the rule that borrowing&#13;
&#13;
countries will not vote against a loan.          Management can&#13;
&#13;
usually count on China and India--the two biggest borrowers--&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Coady, Page 11&#13;
&#13;
to say how wonderful a loan it is to start off the Board&#13;
&#13;
discussion.     If itâ&#128;¢s a loan in Asia very likely they are able&#13;
&#13;
to peel off Japan to speak in favor of the loan.       If itâ&#128;¢s a&#13;
&#13;
loan to West Africa, they can peel off the French.       If itâ&#128;¢s a&#13;
&#13;
loan to East Africa or India, they can peel off the British.&#13;
&#13;
They can make and create divisions within the donor&#13;
&#13;
community, and they have the unanimity of the borrowing&#13;
&#13;
community.     It doesn 1 t take much to end up being isolated.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:      Speaking about the way Management operates, I have&#13;
&#13;
a couple of questions about the relationship between your&#13;
&#13;
work and Management.     Have you seen changes in this&#13;
&#13;
relationship during your time here between, President Conable&#13;
&#13;
and President Preston?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:     Well, I would say in both the Conable and&#13;
&#13;
Preston Administrations the relationship was not as good as&#13;
&#13;
it should be or it can be, for slightly different reasons.&#13;
&#13;
Conable was very affable.     He was very outreaching.    I think&#13;
&#13;
he liked to have a constructive, harmonious consensus, and I&#13;
&#13;
think he worked at it with some of the staff, or had them&#13;
&#13;
work at it.     I also think that the Board felt that they had&#13;
&#13;
access to him.     He worked late; you could call him up and you&#13;
&#13;
go in there five minutes later.      The dean of the Board, on&#13;
&#13;
the other hand was a true polarizing factor between the&#13;
&#13;
borrowing countries and the donor countries.      He lived off&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Coady, Page 12&#13;
&#13;
that conflict.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:     The dean, you said?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:     Yes.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:     And that was?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:    Al-Sultan.     He was the Kuwaiti Director of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank.    I think I was the only one who felt strange about&#13;
&#13;
the fact that he also chaired the G-9 borrowers meetings.          He&#13;
&#13;
wore two hats it would seem.      The new dean doesn't do that.&#13;
&#13;
We've eliminated that conflict on both sides, but the Al-&#13;
&#13;
Sultan situation was awkward.       He lived off of conflict and&#13;
&#13;
in being tough.     Of course, he had some very tough&#13;
&#13;
constituents.     At that point, he had Iraq in his&#13;
&#13;
constituency.     I think the individual views of Directors can&#13;
&#13;
play a big role.     We had some Directors who, in my opinion,&#13;
&#13;
had a view of development which reflected views which weren't&#13;
&#13;
really in the emerging consensus.&#13;
&#13;
     I think Conable had a fractious Board, but I think it's&#13;
&#13;
been--and it's no secret--more difficult with Preston.       I&#13;
&#13;
think he carne out of a corporate system where he controlled&#13;
&#13;
his board, and he didn't have to deal with it on a weekly&#13;
&#13;
basis.    I always said that this institution is a chief&#13;
&#13;
executive's nightmare because you have a live-in Board of&#13;
&#13;
Directors, and it meets often.       The Articles demand that the&#13;
&#13;
Board take on more decisions than a normal Board.       It's very&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Coady, Page 13&#13;
&#13;
complicated, but I think it's been more difficult because of&#13;
&#13;
the personality of Preston.     In some regards, the Board is&#13;
&#13;
not as cohesive as during Conable's term.     Personalities have&#13;
&#13;
a lot to do with this.   I think that the personalities of the&#13;
&#13;
Board since the election last September have, in my view,&#13;
&#13;
dramatically upgraded the Board.     I think there are more&#13;
&#13;
people who are more anxious to have the Board work together,&#13;
&#13;
who have more of a consensus of policies and of development&#13;
&#13;
priorities.   There are a couple of Directors from borrowing&#13;
&#13;
countries who are willing to be critical of loans and bring&#13;
&#13;
their expertise to the Board. Moreover, the Swiss and Russian&#13;
&#13;
membership have changed the debate as well.     With the swiss&#13;
&#13;
representing some borrowing countries, the Dutch representing&#13;
&#13;
borrowing countries, the Belgians and the Italians&#13;
&#13;
representing borrowing countries, the Russians not thinking&#13;
&#13;
of themselves as a developing country, and the Eastern&#13;
&#13;
Europeans not thinking of themselves as developing countries,&#13;
&#13;
you have a greater consenus on most issues from both the&#13;
&#13;
donor and the borrowing side.     Furthermore, I also think that&#13;
&#13;
there are some excellent people on the Board.    They are&#13;
&#13;
better diplomats.   There are some good economists.    I really&#13;
&#13;
like the current Board, and that's making a difference.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:    And how would you say the Board gets along with&#13;
&#13;
Preston?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Coady, Page 14&#13;
&#13;
        MR. COADY:     Well, I think it's very tenuous.&#13;
&#13;
        Q:     Even with the new upgrading of personalities that&#13;
&#13;
you mentioned?&#13;
&#13;
        'MR. COADY:    I think the Board gets along better with&#13;
&#13;
itself, but not necessarily with the President.&#13;
&#13;
        Q:     On the question of the role of the Board in policy-&#13;
&#13;
making, which I gather is not a new new question, isn't it&#13;
&#13;
thought that it's the President that takes the initiative and&#13;
&#13;
proposes policy?        And doesn't some of the tension arise from&#13;
&#13;
the fact that the President sees the Board as proposing&#13;
&#13;
policy?&#13;
&#13;
        MR. COADY:    Well, I'm going to re-phrase your questions.&#13;
&#13;
I don't know whether I know the answers.        I think the Board&#13;
&#13;
is very ineffective at developing policy.        I just don't think&#13;
&#13;
they have the capability.        There are too many interests at&#13;
&#13;
work.        Every time I've been involved in even the simplest of&#13;
&#13;
Board decisions, we cannot come to a consensus.           It is a&#13;
&#13;
totally hopeless process.        Although I was complaining earlier&#13;
&#13;
about the fact that Management divides and conquers, in fact,&#13;
&#13;
it has to, particularly with respect to policy.           If it didn't&#13;
&#13;
play an active role in policy development and negotiating&#13;
&#13;
among Directors, you'd never have any policy in this place.&#13;
&#13;
Where I think the problem of friction with this President,&#13;
&#13;
with all the Presidents, lies is in the Board's tendency to&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Coady, Page 15&#13;
&#13;
micro-manage issues.      This tendency stems from two factors.&#13;
&#13;
One is the Bank's unique Articles of Agreement, which give&#13;
&#13;
the Board more management responsibilities than in a typical&#13;
&#13;
organization.      The founders gave the Board these powers.&#13;
&#13;
This becomes a slippery slope because the Board's powers were&#13;
&#13;
never clear.     If you look at the history of various debates&#13;
&#13;
as to what the rights of the Board and Management are, you&#13;
&#13;
see a long, continuous debate which never ends.      It's always&#13;
&#13;
active and contentious about where that dividing line should&#13;
&#13;
be.&#13;
&#13;
      Q:      In terms of helping to define where that line is&#13;
&#13;
drawn, does Preston has a firmer idea of where the line is?&#13;
&#13;
That policy is to be initiated from his office?      Or--?&#13;
&#13;
      MR. COADY:     Well, I have no evidence to say that Preston&#13;
&#13;
has ever expressed a view that policy is developed in his&#13;
&#13;
office.     I think what he says is "My job is to run the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
and I'll let you know what you need to know.''     So, the debate&#13;
&#13;
is not so much on policy, but on the level of communication.&#13;
&#13;
The other issue is a question of trust.      I don't think the&#13;
&#13;
Board trusts Management.      And I don't think the Board trusts&#13;
&#13;
Preston--&#13;
&#13;
      Q:    What are the issues that feed this lack of trust?&#13;
&#13;
What is it that the Board doesn't trust in Management?&#13;
&#13;
      MR. COADY:     Management tries to sell two things to the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Coady, Page 16&#13;
&#13;
Board and to the outside world.        One,   it knows all the&#13;
&#13;
answers.   And two, it's never wrong.         I get loan documents&#13;
&#13;
that describe a country situation in Kenya which are&#13;
&#13;
completely out of line with what we hear from our own&#13;
&#13;
embassy, our own AID programs, or our own staff.          It's an&#13;
&#13;
attempt to protect the country, yet I feel that I'm not&#13;
&#13;
getting the whole story; that I'm being manipulated; that I'm&#13;
&#13;
not being made a real partner.        In essence, Management is&#13;
&#13;
saying: "We are happy to have your money.         We know we have to&#13;
&#13;
have your vote because the Articles say so, but otherwise,&#13;
&#13;
we'd just as soon you weren't around.         And the more we tell&#13;
&#13;
you, the more you ask for."        That's a losing game, so, as a&#13;
&#13;
result, the game becomes,   11&#13;
                                 we are going to tell you as little&#13;
&#13;
as possible, involve you as little as possible, and inform&#13;
&#13;
you as little as possible."       Unfortunately, from the Board's&#13;
&#13;
point of view, that becomes a matter of distrust and you take&#13;
&#13;
more interest in trying to micro-manage things.          It's just&#13;
&#13;
not a healthy process.   Having said all this, this place&#13;
&#13;
probably runs better than anything that ever came out of the&#13;
&#13;
U.N. kind of multilateral system.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:    The issue, from what you say, is more than just&#13;
&#13;
personalities involved here.        It's a structural set of&#13;
&#13;
problems, so how would you deal with that?         If you were given&#13;
&#13;
the power to make suggestions about how to deal with this set&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  Coady, Page 17&#13;
&#13;
of problems?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:     I think, during my four years, there has&#13;
&#13;
been a re-thinking of the Bank's major polices.     This has to&#13;
&#13;
take place on a regular basis, but, in many areas--the&#13;
&#13;
environment, power, the role of women in development, poverty&#13;
&#13;
reduction, and measuring progress in the portfolio--this&#13;
&#13;
systematic reevaluation was the first of its kind.     There's&#13;
&#13;
been a very healthy, although contentious, period of re-&#13;
&#13;
defining the Bank, and I think there is exhaustion on both&#13;
&#13;
sides--Board and Management, but I think that there's also a&#13;
&#13;
feeling now that we need to implement those policies.     I&#13;
&#13;
forsee some progress in these areas in the near future.&#13;
&#13;
That's my brand of optimism.    However fractious the process&#13;
&#13;
was, I believe that things are getting better.     There is a&#13;
&#13;
better consensus among the Board and Management about what&#13;
&#13;
ought to be done.&#13;
&#13;
     What would I do if I were President?     I would provide&#13;
&#13;
the Board with more information.    The Board members are a&#13;
&#13;
piece of cake.    It actually takes very little to keep us&#13;
&#13;
happy.   Most ot"it is just being honest, informing us, and&#13;
&#13;
meeting with us regularly.     I think a lot of progress could&#13;
&#13;
be made just by making the Bank more of a partner with the&#13;
&#13;
Directors and the outside world.     We need to look inward for&#13;
&#13;
answers and solutions.    We need to be more open to the fact&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Coady, Page 18&#13;
&#13;
that the Bank is really a massive venture capital operation&#13;
&#13;
working in the most difficult countries with the most&#13;
&#13;
difficult circumstances.      Moreover, it's very likely that&#13;
&#13;
not everything it does is going to work.      Everyone ought to&#13;
&#13;
acknowledge that up front, and bring the Bank's constituents-&#13;
&#13;
-shareholders, borrowing countries, environmental groups and&#13;
&#13;
poverty groups--closer together.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:      You characterized the relationship between the&#13;
&#13;
Board and Management as a frustrating one, yet you seem to be&#13;
&#13;
a pretty calm and composed person.     How do you handle this&#13;
&#13;
relationship on a day-to-day basis?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:     Well, I must admit that I have a sense of "I&#13;
&#13;
wish I had done things differently during my four years," to&#13;
&#13;
some large extent.     I wish I had spent more time with fellow&#13;
&#13;
Directors and more time with more people in Management.         I&#13;
&#13;
wish I had tried to find better ways to sell the issues and&#13;
&#13;
to be more of a consensus builder.      I don't know if I could&#13;
&#13;
have done it or not.      Part of the problem is the process, the&#13;
&#13;
way stuff is delivered.     This relates to some of the things&#13;
&#13;
we were   talkin~Â·about   earlier--about how papers get dumped on&#13;
&#13;
the Board.     First you get a final paper.   If you have a&#13;
&#13;
problem with the paper, they [Management] could either know&#13;
&#13;
or have guessed you are going to have a problem.      At that&#13;
&#13;
point in time, you become an enemy if you don't agree with&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Coady, Page 19&#13;
&#13;
the paper.        It's now gone through all levels of Management.&#13;
&#13;
It's gone through councils and planning session.           By the time&#13;
&#13;
it hits my desk it's the Management position.           If I don't&#13;
&#13;
like it, I've got a choice of either accepting it or fighting&#13;
&#13;
it.     Fighting it means lobbying and facing Management's&#13;
&#13;
counter-lobbying.           The process creates this confrontation.&#13;
&#13;
        Q:      Do you ever find yourself in a situation where you&#13;
&#13;
signed on with something that you were not completely happy&#13;
&#13;
with in hopes of shaping it, or having an opportunity to&#13;
&#13;
shape it later down the line?&#13;
&#13;
        MR. COADY:        There's always an element of that.   In any&#13;
&#13;
political process you're never going to hit one hundred&#13;
&#13;
percent, so that's always an element.           I think my frustration&#13;
&#13;
is probably shared by a lot of other Directors.           One of the&#13;
&#13;
bases of my optimism for the future is that we spent the&#13;
&#13;
better part of two years reviewing Board procedures.           That&#13;
&#13;
represents a major reform within the Board, and between the&#13;
&#13;
Board and Management.           It greatly streamlined the policy&#13;
&#13;
formulation process.           If the Bank is trying to develop a new&#13;
&#13;
policy, it could be that there's one set of right things to&#13;
&#13;
do.     Management can put together a paper and we can vote on&#13;
&#13;
it.     However, in all likelihood,       it's not going to be that&#13;
&#13;
easy.        Therefore,    it's more important to have a two- or&#13;
&#13;
three-stage process.           First, where there is an approach&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Coady, Page 20&#13;
&#13;
paper, so that the Board can sit down and debate the terms of&#13;
&#13;
reference of the new policy.        Secondly, we can have a draft&#13;
&#13;
policy, and ask that it take account of outside views--those&#13;
&#13;
of environmental groups, poverty groups, or technical experts&#13;
&#13;
in the power sector.        In any case, there will be a conscious&#13;
&#13;
outreach.        Third, we'll fine-tune that draft policy and&#13;
&#13;
construct a final policy.        That's an example of a new Board&#13;
&#13;
procedure to deal with policy development which really&#13;
&#13;
attempts to overcome some of these past problems.         That's&#13;
&#13;
been in place for a little less than a year.         It has&#13;
&#13;
certainly streamlined procedures, helping us to make better&#13;
&#13;
use of our time.        Furthermore, we're attempting to focus more&#13;
&#13;
on policy and less on micro-management.         I think that's going&#13;
&#13;
to be an important reform that will overcome a lot of the&#13;
&#13;
frustrations that I've felt and probably some other Directors&#13;
&#13;
feel.&#13;
&#13;
        Q:      What has Management's response been to these&#13;
&#13;
changed procedures?&#13;
&#13;
        MR. COADY:     Oh, they love them.   We gave them a good&#13;
&#13;
deal.        There was one Bank-Fund collaboration policy framework&#13;
&#13;
paper (PFP) which took up about ten percent of Board time.&#13;
&#13;
We did away with mandating Board discussion.         PFPs were&#13;
&#13;
really boring, so that was a real bonus to Management.&#13;
&#13;
Moreover, probably less than half the loans will be open to&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Coady, Page 21&#13;
&#13;
Board discussion now.        we will focus on country-assistance&#13;
&#13;
strategies.        I think we 1 ve systematized the policy debate.     I&#13;
&#13;
think that Management was a piece of cake on Board procedures&#13;
&#13;
because they were a real beneficiary.&#13;
&#13;
        Q:      You 1 ve been involved with a number of issues that&#13;
&#13;
we'd like to turn to.        In reviewing material benefits, what&#13;
&#13;
surprised me the most was your proposing to withhold that&#13;
&#13;
$1.3 billion increase capital contributions to the IFC.           It&#13;
&#13;
struck me that the IFC was the part of the Bank that is&#13;
&#13;
really interested in the private sector.         I   want to ask you&#13;
&#13;
what your position was, again, on that issue.&#13;
&#13;
        MR. COADY:     I guess this office spent about two years on&#13;
&#13;
that.        Let 1 s see, that was June of '91, if I remember, and--I&#13;
&#13;
can almost remember, I think it was January 5th, 1990 when&#13;
&#13;
the IFC carne in with a White Paper, outlining a rationale for&#13;
&#13;
a capital increase. I had been here about six months at that&#13;
&#13;
time.        Coming from the private sector (merchant banking),&#13;
&#13;
I'd found the IFC's operation to be very, very good in terms&#13;
&#13;
of how they reported things.        It depends on the specific&#13;
&#13;
issues, but I had very few problems with the IFC.         They asked&#13;
&#13;
us for our opinion, so we said we 1 d take a couple of months&#13;
&#13;
to think it through.        We started a dialogue with World Bank&#13;
&#13;
authorities on the issue, and took a look at the background&#13;
&#13;
and the rationale.        Generally, our early analysis showed that&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                            Coady, Page 22&#13;
&#13;
they had, in our view, plenty of lending capacity.               They&#13;
&#13;
argued they didn't.          That early debate was mostly on&#13;
&#13;
different views of IFC's future growth rate.&#13;
&#13;
        Q:      I'm sorry.   What do you mean by   11&#13;
                                                        lending capacity"?&#13;
&#13;
        MR. COADY:     Well, they have their ability to make new&#13;
&#13;
commitments, and therefore their need for new capital depends&#13;
&#13;
on a certain number of financial ratios.           Most of our early&#13;
&#13;
discussions with them were really on the timing of any&#13;
&#13;
capital increase, not the composition or the conditions of&#13;
&#13;
it, but as to when it would be needed.          Our feeling was that&#13;
&#13;
their request was premature.         We didn't believe the amount&#13;
&#13;
that they had asked for.         We felt they asked for too much.&#13;
&#13;
Moreover, as a matter of policy, the IFC replenishment&#13;
&#13;
provided a rare chance to debate the mandate of the&#13;
&#13;
organization.        In any of the United States multilateral&#13;
&#13;
committments 1 the only real chance to debate the mandates is&#13;
&#13;
when you put in new capital.          In short, we were not&#13;
&#13;
particularly anxious to create a situation where we could go&#13;
&#13;
ten years without discussing the IFC's mandate, and we also&#13;
&#13;
thought that the amount they were asking for seemed out of&#13;
&#13;
line.        The rationale wasn't there for it.         We thought that&#13;
&#13;
the assumptions made about the future growth of the IFC were&#13;
&#13;
not entirely prudent.         We thought that they had been growing&#13;
&#13;
too fast, and that they would develop a portfolio which was&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                           Coady, Page 23&#13;
&#13;
too risky.   We wanted to slow their growth rate.             Under the&#13;
&#13;
scenario with slower growth rate, you didn't need to add new&#13;
&#13;
capital in 1990.&#13;
&#13;
     Most of the debate during 1990 was a friendly discussion&#13;
&#13;
about growth rates and about rationale.              During that time,&#13;
&#13;
however, Eastern Europe evolved, generating new demands on&#13;
&#13;
the Bank's resources and some new priorities, but we had also&#13;
&#13;
kind of gotten into bigger issues.           What is the role of the&#13;
&#13;
private sector in the World Bank?        The Knapp commission&#13;
&#13;
researched this question.   In   1&#13;
                                     88 or    1&#13;
                                                  89 it published a&#13;
&#13;
report which stated, in typical World Bank-ese, "Everything&#13;
&#13;
is going fine, but we might strengthen and add some few&#13;
&#13;
things--like everything."   It laid out some of the agenda&#13;
&#13;
items for World Bank's role and what they could do to be&#13;
&#13;
supportive of the private sector.        A Board paper on the&#13;
&#13;
private sector in development action plans followed the Knapp&#13;
&#13;
commission report.   Analyzing that report, we felt that the&#13;
&#13;
World Bank's own commitment to the private sector was de&#13;
&#13;
minimis, lackluster, incomplete.&#13;
&#13;
     The idea of replenishing the IFC without some clear&#13;
&#13;
commitment from the World Bank for their own side of the&#13;
&#13;
fence wasn't something we were going to do, and that was&#13;
&#13;
contentious because most people thought that was dirty pool.&#13;
&#13;
If you were just replenishing IFC you couldn't debate World&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Coady, Page 24&#13;
&#13;
Bank policies.     Well, the    u.s.,    being the largest shareholder&#13;
&#13;
of both, didn't agree with that.           We felt that we could have&#13;
&#13;
that debate if we wanted to have that debate and, on the IFC&#13;
&#13;
side, our analysis led us to a couple of conclusions.            One&#13;
&#13;
was that they could achieve higher profitability by having&#13;
&#13;
more market-based pricing.        Also, they could realize capital&#13;
&#13;
gains.     They had $500 million in unrealized capital gains&#13;
&#13;
which they weren't realizing.           They could pursue a slower&#13;
&#13;
growth rate.     Therefore, the debate about the size of the&#13;
&#13;
capital increase was, I thought, an honest debate.             In other&#13;
&#13;
words, if you are sitting with unrealized capital gains--&#13;
&#13;
which we had already paid for--and brought that into the&#13;
&#13;
system and if you charged slightly less than full-market&#13;
&#13;
rate, they had a pre-tax return on equity of about six&#13;
&#13;
percent.    Most merchant banks have a return of forty percent,&#13;
&#13;
so we thought that if they went from six to eight, that was&#13;
&#13;
reasonable.    They also provisioned too high for potential&#13;
&#13;
loan losses.&#13;
&#13;
     We had a whole debate about financial policies, growth&#13;
&#13;
rates, and unrealized capital gains.          That debate went on for&#13;
&#13;
a long time.     Now, within the Board you had other debates&#13;
&#13;
going on.     I wouldn't say that the borrowing countries'&#13;
&#13;
agenda is limited, but I think their view of a capital&#13;
&#13;
increase is.     The more the    u.s.   puts in, the better.     There&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Coady, Page 25&#13;
&#13;
wasn't much interest in our debate.         Another issue was&#13;
&#13;
whether the IFC was really following a development strategy.&#13;
&#13;
We found that the World Bank could be reforming the financial&#13;
&#13;
sector in a particular country/ but the IFC wasn't making any&#13;
&#13;
investments in that sector.     They weren't working with the&#13;
&#13;
capital markets.     In another country, the World Bank would&#13;
&#13;
be privatizing the agricultural sector, but the IFC wouldn't&#13;
&#13;
be making any supporting loans.     In short, we found that they&#13;
&#13;
were marching to two different tunes 1 which, in terms of&#13;
&#13;
leveraging our funds and achieving development goals, didn't&#13;
&#13;
help very much.    It seemed like the Bank and the IFC were&#13;
&#13;
working at cross-purposes.&#13;
&#13;
     I suppose it could have been done differently, but, from&#13;
&#13;
my point of view 1 the other Directors didn't show a lot of&#13;
&#13;
interest on these issues.     Since I, and most of Treasury,&#13;
&#13;
came out of investment banking 1 we were a lot more into the&#13;
&#13;
private sector than the typical Board member who came out of&#13;
&#13;
a government bureaucracy.     Most of them view this as a kind&#13;
&#13;
of private sector money machine, and IFC seemed to be running&#13;
&#13;
so much better than everything else that they were touching&#13;
&#13;
that they said, "let's give it some more money and let it go&#13;
&#13;
on its way.''   We became isolated in the debate, but we had&#13;
&#13;
the veto power over the debate.    We could afford to be&#13;
&#13;
isolated.   It was a classic case of   11&#13;
                                            Damned if you do, damned&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Coady, Page 26&#13;
&#13;
if you don't."       No one else was interested in our issues, but&#13;
&#13;
they didn't want us negotiating without them.        That created&#13;
&#13;
kind of a poisoned atmosphere.       Many of the Directors felt&#13;
&#13;
the   us    was micro-managing.   It was a very tough--very tough--&#13;
&#13;
contentious issue ,and it grew into a personalized&#13;
&#13;
controversy.       There aren't many of those at the World Bank,&#13;
&#13;
so when the press found one, they loved it.        Then I guess I&#13;
&#13;
did something which you don't do.        We finally had it wrapped&#13;
&#13;
up.    They not only agreed to support the program, but at the&#13;
&#13;
Board meeting, everyone, every Director, well, virtually&#13;
&#13;
every Director, all morning long said, "We support the&#13;
&#13;
program as outlined.       We support the capital increase.    But&#13;
&#13;
we want to tell you.       we really don't believe in the private&#13;
&#13;
sector.       We don't like to negotiate with only one&#13;
&#13;
shareholder."       So, I'm thinking, why are we voting for the&#13;
&#13;
capital increase?       Why should the U.S. put $250 million in&#13;
&#13;
the hands of a Board who doesn't believe in the policy&#13;
&#13;
framework?       No one in the world would write a check for $250&#13;
&#13;
million based on that Board discussion.        So at lunchtime I&#13;
&#13;
said, "I don't think we can support it."        I said, "We think&#13;
&#13;
you just want the money and don't want the policies."&#13;
&#13;
       Q:      Is that the source of the idea that fifty percent&#13;
&#13;
of the Bank's loans have to be to the private sector?         Or did&#13;
&#13;
that idea come from some other source?&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Coady, Page 27&#13;
&#13;
       MR. COADY:     I'll tell you the frank truth.    We thought&#13;
&#13;
that there was very little private sector expertise within&#13;
&#13;
the World Bank.      We wanted the Bank, if it could, to go out&#13;
&#13;
and hire twenty people who actually had worked in the private&#13;
&#13;
sector in developing countries.       Sprinkling twenty through a&#13;
&#13;
Bank staff of seven thousand didn't seem like too much to&#13;
&#13;
ask.   We also wanted some other things.       We wanted a&#13;
&#13;
majority of Bank loans, not to lend to the private sector,&#13;
&#13;
but to take account of the private sector in their&#13;
&#13;
implementation.      On health services loans, it would take a&#13;
&#13;
look at ways to deliver health services other than through&#13;
&#13;
government agencies.       On road contracts, we didn't want to&#13;
&#13;
settle for having a government road contractor, but to try to&#13;
&#13;
stimulate the development of local institutional capacity.&#13;
&#13;
In short, we wanted the Bank, if it made any sense, to look&#13;
&#13;
at the concept of privatization before giving money to public&#13;
&#13;
institutions.       Basically, someone in the Bank leaked the&#13;
&#13;
issue inaccurately to the press, and the press wrote it up as&#13;
&#13;
a demand that the Bank lend to the private sector.         This&#13;
&#13;
didn't make anyÂ· sense, because the Articles prohibit it.&#13;
&#13;
That's not what we asked for.       What we asked for was that the&#13;
&#13;
majority of Bank loans look at ways to help support the&#13;
&#13;
private sector, but it had to be in the context of the loan.&#13;
&#13;
The funds did not have to go directly to the private sector.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Coady, Page 28&#13;
&#13;
     Separately, we asked the Bank to do a study of the&#13;
&#13;
Articles of the Bank to determine how much they limited the&#13;
&#13;
Bank's ability to support the private sector.      The Articles&#13;
&#13;
require the Bank to take a government guarantee from its&#13;
&#13;
borrowers.    The Inter-American Development Bank doesn't have&#13;
&#13;
that restriction.    The Asian Development Bank doesn't have&#13;
&#13;
that restriction.    The U.S.,   in recent negotiations at that&#13;
&#13;
time with the European Bank for Reconstruction and&#13;
&#13;
Development, mandated that sixty percent of the loans had to&#13;
&#13;
go directly to the private sector.     The issue for the United&#13;
&#13;
States was,    in terms of their view of how these institutions&#13;
&#13;
best served development, that the World Bank had the most&#13;
&#13;
restrictive Articles.    A large proportion of our research&#13;
&#13;
within the Bank implied that this was, in fact, a real&#13;
&#13;
problem.     For example, the Fred Levy Report, the World&#13;
&#13;
Development Report for 1989, I think it was, documented the&#13;
&#13;
failure of financial intermediaries in developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
Most of them were bankrupt, and most of them were created in&#13;
&#13;
order to get around the fact that the Bank has to lend&#13;
&#13;
through governments.    We had all these financial&#13;
&#13;
intermediaries designed to take World Bank funds on lend to&#13;
&#13;
the private sectors, and the funds were corrupted through&#13;
&#13;
that channel.    They didn't go to the right place;    they&#13;
&#13;
didn't go to the targeted projects; and there was no&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Coady, Page 29&#13;
&#13;
discipline.      There's no question it was a legitimate&#13;
&#13;
concern, but it became lost in the the whole milieu of the&#13;
&#13;
debate. In any case, I think it was one of the most enjoyable&#13;
&#13;
parts of my time .here.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:     You briefly touched on the issue of coordination&#13;
&#13;
between World Bank lending and IFC lending.      Was that a big&#13;
&#13;
component of what you were asking for?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:     Yes.   And in the agreement there was a&#13;
&#13;
presumption that where the IFC could play a role, it should.&#13;
&#13;
I must say six months ago they violated that, but--&#13;
&#13;
     Q:     In what way?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:     Well, World Bank made a loan to the&#13;
&#13;
Philippine Long Distance Telephone Company, which was listed&#13;
&#13;
on the New York Stock Exchange, and the Pacific Stock&#13;
&#13;
Exchange.     First Boston was doing a $300 million underwriting&#13;
&#13;
at the same time.     The IFC had made three previous&#13;
&#13;
operations, so, that information didn't get to that part of&#13;
&#13;
the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:     Was a compromise worked out?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:     Well, once again, if you looked at the Knapp&#13;
&#13;
Report and the Private Sector Development Action Plan, one of&#13;
&#13;
the things it identified in 1988 was the fact that the&#13;
&#13;
collaboration between the IFC and the World Bank was&#13;
&#13;
terrible.     If you talk to the people at the IFC they will&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                        Coady, Page 30&#13;
&#13;
tell you that the marching orders from the senior management&#13;
&#13;
of the IFC tell them stay as far away as you can from the&#13;
&#13;
World Bank as possible.       The IFC views the Bank as too&#13;
&#13;
bureaucratic.     The Bank takes forever to make a decision.&#13;
&#13;
The IFC thought they would never get anything done if forced&#13;
&#13;
to deal with the Bank.        It wasn't a big secret.     Knapp had&#13;
&#13;
identified the conflict.       Everyone had identified it.      And we&#13;
&#13;
simply asked the Bank and the IFC if they would work&#13;
&#13;
together.     It was like doing a marriage.     We asked the Bank&#13;
&#13;
and the IFC if they would renew their vows like we&#13;
&#13;
occasionally ask the Bank and the Fund to renew their vows.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:     Do you think this has worked out?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:      Today?&#13;
&#13;
     Q:     Today.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:     It's working better?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:      There's been some very good examples of&#13;
&#13;
better collaboration, but I would say it's not working well&#13;
&#13;
yet, at all.     I think there is still a big cultural&#13;
&#13;
difference.     I'm very sympathetic to the IFC.        I think the&#13;
&#13;
World Bank is very tough to work with.        They take a very long&#13;
&#13;
time to do things.      I think thethe Bank and the IFC attract&#13;
&#13;
two different kinds of people.       The two institutions have&#13;
&#13;
different kinds of operating systems.        I think it's very&#13;
&#13;
tough but, one success story that comes to mind is Morocco.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Coady, Page 31&#13;
&#13;
I think the Morocco case is a product of two people who&#13;
&#13;
really believe it's a good idea to collaborate.        There have&#13;
&#13;
been some other countries.        I don't know how it is picking up&#13;
&#13;
steam, but there are a lot of countries where it still isn't,&#13;
&#13;
like the Philippines.     The IFC loans to the public sector&#13;
&#13;
while the World Bank loans to the private sector, and this&#13;
&#13;
was all in the last six months.        In Uruguay, the World Bank&#13;
&#13;
had a financial sector reform loan where they took the three&#13;
&#13;
largest banks, privatized them, and cleaned up the loan&#13;
&#13;
portfolio.    About a year later, the IFC made an investment in&#13;
&#13;
one of them, totally independent of the previous operation,&#13;
&#13;
without any references in the loan documentation.        They&#13;
&#13;
hadn't talked to each other.&#13;
&#13;
     I just saw a loan for an East European country.        It&#13;
&#13;
happened to have a reference to the IFC in it.        It has three&#13;
&#13;
paragraphs on the IFC collaboration with the Bank.        I showed&#13;
&#13;
it to him.    [an IFC official)    He says, I've never seen this.&#13;
&#13;
No one from the IFC wrote this.       So, anyway, it has a long&#13;
&#13;
way to go.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:      Another issue that you've become identified with is&#13;
&#13;
the question of the environment.       And I'd like to talk just a&#13;
&#13;
little bit about what it is you've been doing with the Bank&#13;
&#13;
on environmental issues.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:     Well, I would say I have probably spent over&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Coady, Page 32&#13;
&#13;
twenty-five percent of all my time at the Bank on&#13;
&#13;
environmental issues.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:      How did you personally get interested 1n that set&#13;
&#13;
of issues?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:      Well, I do have a personal interest in it,&#13;
&#13;
but it was also clear to me that this was going to be very&#13;
&#13;
important for this office and for the Bank.       We just had to&#13;
&#13;
look at the letters that were coming in, what Congress was up&#13;
&#13;
to, and the other kinds of questi6ns people were raising.&#13;
&#13;
When I arrived here, it was just the start of the IDA-9&#13;
&#13;
negotiations, and Congresswoman Pelosi had introduced&#13;
&#13;
legislation regarding environmental assessment procedures.&#13;
&#13;
Debt-for-nature transactions were the rage.       The Rio&#13;
&#13;
Conference was on the horizon.       People were still recovering&#13;
&#13;
from resettlement debates over the infamous road project in&#13;
&#13;
Rondonia, Brazil.       The Tropical Forest Action Plan was going&#13;
&#13;
full blast.     Energy efficiency was emerging as an issue.&#13;
&#13;
Environmental issues popped up every place you looked, and I&#13;
&#13;
think the    u.s.   and Canadian governments were really&#13;
&#13;
concerned. I wasn't here for the Berlin Annual Meeting, but I&#13;
&#13;
understand it was particularly contentious.       All of the   u.s.&#13;
environmental groups applied for admission to the annual&#13;
&#13;
meetings through this office.       Of course, most of them ended&#13;
&#13;
up getting arrested.       You have to sort through that and deny&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Coady, Page 33&#13;
&#13;
some of them visitor status because they wouldn't promise not&#13;
&#13;
to be arrested.&#13;
&#13;
     Of the policy portion of the IDA-9 negotiations,&#13;
&#13;
probably seventy-five percent of the discussions focused on&#13;
&#13;
environmental issues.     The decisions that emerged from those&#13;
&#13;
discussions had to be implemented.&#13;
&#13;
     The World Bank, FAO, and WRI were co-sponsors of the&#13;
&#13;
Tropical Forest Action Plan which was in the process of&#13;
&#13;
collapsing at the time, and I became very much involved in&#13;
&#13;
the creation of a new forestry policy paper, which looked at&#13;
&#13;
the World Bank's role in the forestry sector.       Not long after&#13;
&#13;
that, the Global Environmental Facility was proposed by the&#13;
&#13;
Germans and the French.    Since no one wanted to head the U.S.&#13;
&#13;
delegation, I ended up heading it from the first meeting&#13;
&#13;
until recently.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   Why wouldn't anyone else?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:   Well, because the   u.s.   answer was No.    When&#13;
&#13;
someone is supposed to go to all these meetings and say No,&#13;
&#13;
it is not an attractive job.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   You didn't mind being the person?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:   No.   I didn't mind being the person.       After&#13;
&#13;
the IFC, I could say No, and still survive.       There was also&#13;
&#13;
the feeling in the U.s. Government that they were not going&#13;
&#13;
to be left out of the process, and that the U.S. should try&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                    Coady, Page 34&#13;
&#13;
to be constructive.      My view of the situation was different.&#13;
&#13;
The GEF was proposed at the World Bank Annual Meetings, and&#13;
&#13;
the World Bank was going to be running the Trust Fund and be&#13;
&#13;
the principal project implementer. This made some sense.         My&#13;
&#13;
office and the    u.s.   Government felt the Global Environmental&#13;
&#13;
Facility should be lock-stepped with everything else that was&#13;
&#13;
going on at the World Bank in terms of the IDA-9 agenda.         It&#13;
&#13;
seemed to us that we needed to integrate these initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
They were going to be Siamese twins.      They were presumably&#13;
&#13;
separate but not separable.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   Isn't one focused on things like the quality of&#13;
&#13;
water, and health issues, and the GEF is looking at the&#13;
&#13;
larger environmental kinds of issues?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:     That stream can run either way.    I tend&#13;
&#13;
conceptually to think of it this way.       If the World Bank does&#13;
&#13;
what it probably has to do, and should do, with respect to&#13;
&#13;
the Rio Conference, and encourages a proper relationship&#13;
&#13;
between the environment and development, in ten years the&#13;
&#13;
Global Environmental Facility won't be necessary. Actions&#13;
&#13;
that nations take in their own self-interest will probably&#13;
&#13;
address their international environmental responsibilities&#13;
&#13;
simultaneously.     In other words, you are really not going to&#13;
&#13;
be able to separate local and global environmental issues.&#13;
&#13;
On the other hand, the GEF was meant to take a look at those&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                 Coady, Page 35&#13;
&#13;
issues which had a clear global impact or benefit, and&#13;
&#13;
evaluate the costs of addressing them.    Whether it was&#13;
&#13;
climate, biodiversity, international waters, or the ozone,&#13;
&#13;
the GEF was intended to be a mechanism that would give some&#13;
&#13;
encouragement to countries to take action more quickly on&#13;
&#13;
global issues that might not enter their own thinking until&#13;
&#13;
later.   Ultimately, however, global and local issues merge.&#13;
&#13;
Taking climate as an example, if Nigeria or Iran subsidizes&#13;
&#13;
energy, whether it's flaring of gas or a lack of pollution&#13;
&#13;
control, they promote its missuse. The right fix to that&#13;
&#13;
situation is mostly pricing, and also some pollution control&#13;
&#13;
devices to which the national benefits--in terms of proper&#13;
&#13;
economic management--are so overwhelming that we ought to&#13;
&#13;
move on them regardless of the Global Environmental Facility.&#13;
&#13;
Look at Bangkok, where over the past twenty years the average&#13;
&#13;
I.Q. fell by four or five points because of lead pollution.&#13;
&#13;
They ought to fix that.   Countries can't afford to have large&#13;
&#13;
environmental problems, like those in Mexico City, on their&#13;
&#13;
hands.   They can't afford to have that, but if they fix it, a&#13;
&#13;
lot of their cll~ate problems go away.    Conversely, if you&#13;
&#13;
are providing grant money to the Global Environmental&#13;
&#13;
Facility and they aren't fixing the pricing problem, it's&#13;
&#13;
like throwing that money down the tube.    If you don't have a&#13;
&#13;
policy framework which integrates both local and global&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                      Coady, Page 36&#13;
&#13;
instruments, you are undermining both .&#13;
                               .&#13;
     Q:    It seems that a lot of environmental groups had a&#13;
&#13;
hard time understanding this philosophy.&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:   Well, I don't think they have a hard time.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:    You don't think so?&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:   They just wanted something different.          They&#13;
&#13;
wanted an institution where they had a bigger voice.            It was&#13;
&#13;
easy for them to say the World Bank had a terrible track&#13;
&#13;
record on the environment.         I think the World Bank did some&#13;
&#13;
things which were pretty bad.        The World Bank deserved that&#13;
&#13;
kind of criticism, but the environmental groups made a&#13;
&#13;
judgment that it would be hard to reform the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
They wanted an institution where they had a seat at the&#13;
&#13;
table, and they didn't see one emerging at the World Bank or&#13;
&#13;
the other Development Banks.        Therefore, they sought to form&#13;
&#13;
an alliance with the developing countries, who were hoping to&#13;
&#13;
get a new pot of money that they could draw upon with less&#13;
&#13;
conditionality.   It was a marriage of interests.        In a&#13;
&#13;
certain sense, the evironmental groups weren't totally honest&#13;
&#13;
because they ha'l:f a different agenda.     They had different&#13;
&#13;
goals.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:   How would you evaluate the relationship now between&#13;
&#13;
the Bank and these groups?      Has it improved?     It appeared to&#13;
&#13;
reach a high point   a   couple of years back, and since then,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                         Coady, Page 37&#13;
&#13;
has there been a retrenchment, or have things remained status&#13;
&#13;
quo?&#13;
&#13;
        MR. COADY:        With the hiring of environmental&#13;
&#13;
specialists and with fresh policies, the Bank has made huge&#13;
&#13;
strides toward making the environment a central concern of&#13;
&#13;
their development projects.          The speed and comprehensiveness&#13;
&#13;
of this transformation has been miraculous.            I think the&#13;
&#13;
environmental groups recognize that, and I think they are&#13;
&#13;
willing to say the Bank has made great progress.&#13;
&#13;
Nevertheless, some groups will never be satisfied.&#13;
&#13;
        Q:      I have a final question.&#13;
&#13;
        MR. COADY:     Yes.&#13;
&#13;
        Q:      It has to do with a perennial issue at the World&#13;
&#13;
Bank.        I don't recall if you spoke about World Bank salaries.&#13;
&#13;
        MR. COADY:     Oh, my God!&#13;
&#13;
        Q:     Speaking as someone who has come from the private&#13;
&#13;
sector and knows how expensive talent can be, what are your&#13;
&#13;
thoughts about the whole issue of salaries within the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
        MR. COADY:     Well, the   u.s.   has voted against the staff&#13;
&#13;
compensation prtipqsals each of the four years I've been here,&#13;
&#13;
including last week,' and I've been an enthusiastic supporter&#13;
&#13;
of that No vote.          There is an irony to it because there was a&#13;
&#13;
Joint Committee on Compensation here in the Bank and the&#13;
&#13;
Fund, and the      u.s.    was instrumental in having that Joint&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                     Coady, Page 38&#13;
&#13;
Committee created.     It probably held up its final&#13;
&#13;
recommendations to get some points that it wanted, but&#13;
&#13;
finally signed on to it.    The first management proposal after&#13;
&#13;
that, in our view, walked away from the recommendations of&#13;
&#13;
that Joint Committee.    The hope of the   u.s.   was that those&#13;
&#13;
recommendations would have created a system which would have&#13;
&#13;
paid Bank staff basically the seventy-fifth percentile of a&#13;
&#13;
comparative group which was drawn mostly from the private&#13;
&#13;
sector.    For support staff, it would created a system which&#13;
&#13;
says, "We are going to pay above average, and we'll try to&#13;
&#13;
pay for the kind of top-flight professional staff we want to&#13;
&#13;
have."    The Joint Committee's system was systematic and&#13;
&#13;
transparent.    It could have gotten us out of the salary&#13;
&#13;
debate, but it was implemented in such a way that, rather&#13;
&#13;
than create a separate pay line for support staff, it created&#13;
&#13;
a pay line which was an extrapolation of higher-level staff.&#13;
&#13;
As a result, you ended up paying close to a hundred percent&#13;
&#13;
of the Washington market.    Moreover, the Bank doesn't even&#13;
&#13;
hire Americans from the Washington market.        It recruits&#13;
&#13;
Filipinos, Paki~tanis, and Argentines, and flies them over&#13;
&#13;
here and hires them.     In the current situation, where you&#13;
&#13;
have sixty-nine percent of higher level Bank staff working in&#13;
&#13;
four grade levels, which makes very few distinctions between&#13;
&#13;
skill mixes that they use out in the marketplace.        If you&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                   Coady, Page 39&#13;
&#13;
really wanted to get a good engineer, a good lawyer, a good&#13;
&#13;
private sector specialist, or something else, you probably&#13;
&#13;
can't pay them enough, and the people that you can get a lot&#13;
&#13;
of, you overpay. In my view, you have a system which doesn't&#13;
&#13;
permit the Bank to pay for the quality people it needs, and&#13;
&#13;
overpays others.     This creates a private sector pay scale,&#13;
&#13;
but with civil service security.     This results in rigidity,&#13;
&#13;
impeding the Banks ability to regenerate its staff.        I don't&#13;
&#13;
think the Bank's payscale is a healthy human resource&#13;
&#13;
instrument.     That's my view.   It's expensive, and I think a&#13;
&#13;
lot of the people in the Staff Association would agree with&#13;
&#13;
me on that.     There are complications we have with the&#13;
&#13;
Administrative Tribunal, which argues that a cost-of-living&#13;
&#13;
increase is a God-given right.     Now, that's not my experience&#13;
&#13;
in the private sector, but the Administrative Tribunal seems&#13;
&#13;
to think so.     You try to bend it to be able to recruit in&#13;
&#13;
strong currency markets, the Netherlands, Germany, France,&#13;
&#13;
and Japan, but then we're basically boosting the entire&#13;
&#13;
7,000-person pay line upward to recruit thirty-three people,&#13;
&#13;
which isn't thei~right answer to the problem.     It hasn't&#13;
&#13;
worked.     You've got ~he pay scale and you still can't get the&#13;
&#13;
Italians, Germans, French, and Japanese to come here because&#13;
&#13;
of cultural reasons.     At any rate, I just think the system is&#13;
&#13;
terrible.     It doesn't permit you to get the top-flight&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                       Coady, Page 40&#13;
&#13;
people, and, in fact, encourages people to stay when there&#13;
&#13;
ought to be some natural turnover.         The irony for me&#13;
&#13;
personally is that I'm a great believer in human resource&#13;
&#13;
motivation and in paying market value.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:      I'm sorry we had to end on such a sour note, but--&#13;
&#13;
     MR. COADY:     I don't mind ending on that, because I think&#13;
&#13;
that this is a place you walk into some mornings and it's so&#13;
&#13;
exciting and the issues are so grave, and the Bank is so&#13;
&#13;
effective, so great, so responsive, and the people are so&#13;
&#13;
terrific, that you just feel like a million dollars.          On the&#13;
&#13;
other hand, there are other days you just want to lock all&#13;
&#13;
the doors and send everybody home.          It's a really roller-&#13;
&#13;
coaster, emotional ride in this place, and it probably always&#13;
&#13;
has been.     I think the    u.s.   Director's roller coaster has an&#13;
&#13;
extra element of thrills.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:      Oh, well, it's happier to end on that note, then.&#13;
&#13;
Thank you.&#13;
&#13;
     Q:      Thank you very much.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

            In April 1993, E. Patrick Coady was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by William Becker and David Milobsky. During
            his tenure at the Bank from 1989 to 1993, Mr. Coady served
            as executive director representing the United States. He
            discusses this dual role both as representative of and as
            spokesman to the United States for the World Bank. His
            transcript addresses in detail the request of the
            International Finance Corporation (IFC) in January 1990 for
            a $250 million capital increase, his involvement therein,
            and the rationale of the organization versus that of the
            United States government. He concludes discussing the pros
            and cons of the salary system at the World Bank.
