Understanding Small Scale&#13;
Providers of Sanitation Services:&#13;
A Case Study of Kibera&#13;
&#13;
Little is understood of the work of Small Scale Providers of Sanitation Services and their central&#13;
role in sanitation provision but now researchers and urban planners are starting to pay attention.&#13;
Focusing on sanitation providers in the informal settlement of Kibera in Nairobi, this field note&#13;
provides better understanding of who the SSPSS are, the range of services they offer, and&#13;
recommends options for improving the quality and efficiency of their services.&#13;

Kibera a sprawling informal settlement in&#13;
Nairobi, Kenya, is home to half a million&#13;
people. Here, Small Scale Providers of&#13;
Sanitation Services (SSPSS) play a&#13;
central role in sanitation provision,&#13;
including the management of public&#13;
toilet blocks, the construction of latrines,&#13;
and the removal of sludge.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Until now, little work has been done to&#13;
understand and evaluate the work of&#13;
SSPs, but their importance in the             Kibera's streets are characterized by uncollected garbage and clogged drainage channels&#13;

The business of&#13;
building latrines&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Latrines in Kibera are normally simple&#13;
constructions of mud, wood and&#13;
sheets of corrugated iron erected by&#13;
unskilled workers, so there is little&#13;
demand for builders with specialized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                         7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The three main emptying techniques          Box 1: The manual pit emptiers' burden&#13;
employed in Kibera are manual,&#13;
mechanical, and gravitational.&#13;
                                            Few manual emptiers can afford basic protective gear such as gloves and boots&#13;
&#13;
Manual emptying: an                         for their work. Lack of equipment exposes them to infections and diseases,&#13;
&#13;
irreplaceable activity                      especially when working directly in the pit, which they commonly refer to as the&#13;
&#13;
                                            `kitchen'. Here, the manual pit emptiers are in direct contact with excreta, broken&#13;
Manual emptying of pit latrines is the      glass, and other discarded waste thrown in the pits and, as a result, are likely to&#13;
method of choice for 28 percent of&#13;

households in Kibera (see Graph 2). It&#13;
is well suited to slum conditions such      In addition to being difficult and unhealthy, the work has a very negative social&#13;
&#13;
as chronic overcrowding, poor               image and they are often obliged to work at night. Frequently excluded and&#13;
&#13;
vehicular access and heavy sludge,          stigmatized, these workers express frustration and would like the importance of&#13;
&#13;
which is difficult to pump up into          their work to be recognized. Moreover, manual emptiers are ignored by public&#13;
&#13;
trucks.                                     authorities, despite the role they play in the domestic pit emptying market. They&#13;
&#13;
                                            are often harassed by youth groups who use violence to extort bribes from them.&#13;
&#13;
This sector comprises small groups of       There is a mistaken perception that manual emptying is illegal.&#13;
&#13;
people working together on a regular&#13;
basis, and some individual operators        Manual emptying will remain as a necessary method for exhausting pit latrines for&#13;
&#13;
who work on an occasional basis.            as long as vehicle access is limited in Kibera.&#13;
&#13;
Since manual emptying is largely a&#13;
seasonal activity it is not necessarily&#13;
the main source of income for either&#13;
group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Estimates suggest there are between&#13;
50 - 100 manual emptiers working in&#13;
Kibera, resulting in competition around&#13;
service quality and features such as&#13;
the use of a handcart, wheelbarrow or&#13;
buckets for transport.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The use of 0.2m3 (200 liters) capacity&#13;
drums does not allow the workers to&#13;
fully empty a pit in one trip as pit&#13;
capacity ranges from 2m3 to 3m3.&#13;
When working as a group, people pool&#13;
together and use personal savings&#13;
(US$39-US$104) to buy equipment,&#13;
but individuals working alone are&#13;
usually not able to afford this type of&#13;
investment. Incomes are irregular and&#13;
modest, but still above the minimum&#13;
&#13;
wage for a general laborer in Nairobi&#13;
(see Graph 1).&#13;

Limited access hinders real&#13;
&#13;
competition in mechanical&#13;
emptying services&#13;
&#13;
Mechanical emptying is the first choice&#13;
of households (See Graph 2), as it is&#13;
the cheapest, most hygienic and&#13;
fastest method. Nevertheless, the&#13;
presence of sludge and solid waste in&#13;
the pit hampers the process.&#13;
Accessibility is also a huge problem for&#13;
mechanical emptiers and is the&#13;
greatest deterrent to real competition in&#13;

emptying is a seasonal activity with&#13;
&#13;
peak periods corresponding to rainy&#13;

seasons, when the sludge is washed&#13;
away by rainwater. Manual and&#13;
gravitational emptying are compromise&#13;
solutions to the sanitation problems of&#13;
Kibera. They enable the residents to&#13;
&#13;
clear their latrines but with adverse&#13;
consequences for health and the&#13;
environment. Improper excreta&#13;
disposal is a major health risk and&#13;
contaminates the river water. Blocked&#13;
drains and heaps of uncollected&#13;
garbage are unsightly, unpleasant and&#13;
provide breeding sites for mosquitoes&#13;
and flies.&#13;

    sector. Regulating mechanisms need to be developed                     sludge disposal options, which would lead to the&#13;
&#13;
    to avoid the formation of cartels.                                     development of a sludge disposal policy that would&#13;

2. Promote a stakeholders' dialogue                                        specify accountable roles and enable the construction&#13;
&#13;
    Dialogue between the various stakeholders (SSPSS,                      of appropriate facilities.&#13;
&#13;
    public authorities, utilities, development organizations)         6. Facilitate and regulate the use of sewer manholes&#13;

    articulate activities of the various actors, and to make               in Kibera as a solution to liquid sludge disposal should&#13;

    better use of the skills and know-how of the local                     be encouraged and regulated through a licence issued&#13;

    Better coordination between NGOs, who are often&#13;
&#13;
    project pioneers who link donors with communities,                7. Support private investment into public latrines&#13;

    would greatly improve the efficiency of assistance to                  Public authorities should support and encourage&#13;

4. Create an enabling framework for SSPSS                                  blocks. This would include assurance of investment&#13;

    Start discussion between public sanitation authorities                 durability through property titles, and discounted rates&#13;
&#13;
    and SSPSS to develop agreements, and good                              for water supply. Commercial management of latrine&#13;
&#13;
    professional practices especially with regard to sludge                blocks needs to be encouraged and regulated.&#13;
&#13;
    disposal. This framework should not restrain SSPSS,               8. Train masons for latrine construction&#13;
&#13;
    but rather take advantage of their flexibility.                        Government and NGOs should support the training of&#13;

            Understanding small scale providers of
            sanitation services : a case study of Kibera
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Little is understood of the work of
            Small Scale Providers of Sanitation Services (SSPSS) and
            their central role in sanitation provision but now
            researchers and urban planners are starting to pay
            attention. Focusing on sanitation providers in the informal
            settlement of Kibera in Nairobi, this field note provides
            better understanding of who the SSPSS are, the range of
            services they offer, and recommends options for improving
            the quality and efficiency of their services.
