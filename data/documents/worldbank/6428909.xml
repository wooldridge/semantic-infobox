&#13;
The Little Data Book 2005 is a pocket edition of World Development&#13;
&#13;
Indicators. It is intended as a quick reference for users of the World&#13;

&#13;
and span 40 years.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The 207 country pages in The Little Data Book present the latest available&#13;
&#13;
data for World Bank member countries and other economies with populations&#13;
&#13;
of more than 30,000. The 14 summary pages cover regional and income&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Data notes&#13;
&#13;
The data in this book are for 1990, 2002, and 2003 or the most recent year&#13;
&#13;
for which data are available unless otherwise noted in the glossary.&#13;
&#13;
    ·    Growth rates are proportional changes from the previous year unless&#13;
&#13;
         otherwise noted.&#13;
&#13;
    ·    Regional aggregates include data for low- and middle-income&#13;
&#13;
         economies only.&#13;
&#13;
    ·    Figures in italics indicate data for years or periods other than those&#13;
&#13;
         specified.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Symbols used:&#13;
&#13;
           ..  means that data are not available or that aggregates cannot be&#13;
&#13;
               calculated because of missing data.&#13;
&#13;
   0 or 0.0    means zero or less than half the unit shown.&#13;
&#13;
           $   means current U.S. dollars.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Data are shown for economies with populations greater than 30,000 and for&#13;
&#13;
smaller economies if they are members of the World Bank. The term country&#13;
&#13;
(used interchangeably with economy) does not imply political independence&#13;
&#13;
or official recognition by the World Bank but refers to any economy for which&#13;
&#13;
the authorities report separate social or economic statistics.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In keeping with World Development Indicators 2005, The Little Data Book 2005&#13;
&#13;
uses terminology in line with the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA). In par-&#13;
&#13;
ticular, gross national product (GNP) is replaced by gross national income (GNI).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Since 2003 the selection of indicators in these pages has been updated to&#13;
&#13;
include some of the indicators being used to monitor progress toward the&#13;
&#13;
Millennium Development Goals. For more information about the eight goals--&#13;
&#13;
halving poverty and increasing well-being by 2015--please visit the web site&#13;

Indicators series.&#13;

&#13;
For operational and analytical purposes the World Bank's main criterion for&#13;
&#13;
classifying economies is gross national income (GNI) per capita. Every econ-&#13;
&#13;
omy is classified as low income, middle income (subdivided into lower middle&#13;
&#13;
and upper middle), or high income. Low- and middle-income economies are&#13;
&#13;
sometimes referred to as developing economies. The use of the term is con-&#13;
&#13;
venient; it is not intended to imply that all economies in the group are expe-&#13;
&#13;
riencing similar development or that other economies have reached a&#13;
&#13;
preferred or final stage of development. Note that classification by income&#13;
&#13;
does not necessarily reflect development status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Low-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $765 or less in 2003.&#13;
&#13;
Middle-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of more than $765&#13;
&#13;
but less than $9,386.&#13;
&#13;
Lower-middle-income and upper-middle-income economies are separated at&#13;
&#13;
a GNI per capita of $3,035.&#13;
&#13;
High-income economies are those with a GNI per capita of $9,386 or more.&#13;
&#13;

China. On July 1, 1997, China resumed its exercise of sovereignty over Hong&#13;
Kong, and on December 20, 1999, it resumed its exercise of sovereignty over&#13;
Macao. Unless otherwise noted, data for China do not include data for Hong&#13;
Kong, China; Taiwan, China; or Macao, China.&#13;
&#13;
Democratic Republic of Congo. Data for the Democratic Republic of Congo&#13;
(Congo, Dem. Rep., in the table listings) refer to the former Zaire. (The&#13;
Republic of Congo is referred to as Congo, Rep., in the table listings.)&#13;
&#13;
Czech Republic and Slovak Republic. Data are shown whenever possible for&#13;
the individual countries formed from the former Czechoslovakia--the Czech&#13;
Republic and the Slovak Republic.&#13;
&#13;
Eritrea. Data are shown for Eritrea whenever possible, but in most cases&#13;
before 1992 Eritrea is included in the data for Ethiopia.&#13;
&#13;
Germany. Data for Germany refer to the unified Germany unless otherwise&#13;
noted.&#13;
&#13;
Serbia and Montenegro. On February 4, 2003, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia&#13;
changed its name to Serbia and Montenegro.&#13;
&#13;
Timor-Leste. On May 20, 2002, Timor-Leste became an independent country.&#13;
Data for Indonesia include Timor-Leste through 1999 unless otherwise noted.&#13;
&#13;
Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. In 1991 the Union of Soviet Socialist&#13;
Republics came to an end. Available data are shown for the individual coun-&#13;
tries now existing on its former territory (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus,&#13;
Estonia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, Moldova,&#13;
Russian Federation, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, and Uzbekistan).&#13;
External debt data presented for the Russian Federation prior to 1992 are for&#13;
the former Soviet Union. The debt of the former Soviet Union is included in&#13;
the Russian Federation data after 1992 on the assumption that 100 percent&#13;
of all outstanding external debt as of December 1991 has become a liability&#13;
of the Russian Federation. Beginning in 1993 the data for the Russian&#13;
Federation have been revised to include obligations to members of the former&#13;
Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and other countries in the form of&#13;
trade-related credits amounting to $15.4 billion as of the end of 1996.&#13;
&#13;
República Bolivariana de Venezuela. In December 1999 the official name of&#13;
Venezuela was changed to República Bolivariana de Venezuela (Venezuela,&#13;
RB, in the table listings).&#13;
&#13;
Republic of Yemen. Data for the Republic of Yemen refer to that country from&#13;
1990 onward; data for previous years refer to aggregated data for the former&#13;
People's Democratic Republic of Yemen and the former Yemen Arab Republic&#13;
unless otherwise noted.&#13;

Glossary&#13;
Access to an improved water source is the percentage of the population with&#13;
    reasonable access to an adequate amount of water from an improved&#13;
    source, such as a household connection, public standpipe, borehole, pro-&#13;
    tected well or spring, or rainwater collection. Unimproved sources include&#13;
    vendors, tanker trucks, and unprotected wells and springs. Reasonable&#13;
    access is defined as the availability of at least 20 liters a person a day&#13;
    from a source within 1 kilometer of the dwelling. (World Health&#13;
    Organization/United Nations Children's Fund Joint Monitoring Programme)&#13;
&#13;
Access to improved sanitation facilities is the percentage of the population&#13;
    with at least adequate excreta disposal facilities (private or shared, but&#13;
    not public) that can effectively prevent human, animal, and insect con-&#13;
    tact with excreta. Improved facilities range from simple but protected pit&#13;
    latrines to flush toilets with a sewerage connection. To be effective, facil-&#13;
    ities must be correctly constructed and properly maintained. (World&#13;
    Health Organization/United Nations Children's Fund Joint Monitoring&#13;
    Programme)&#13;
&#13;
Aid per capita is official development assistance and official aid received from&#13;
    members of the OECD, Development Assistance Committee and other offi-&#13;
    cial donors. (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)&#13;
&#13;
Aircraft departures are the number of domestic and international takeoffs of air&#13;
    carriers registered in the country. (International Civil Aviation Organization)&#13;
&#13;
Births attended by skilled health staff are the percentage of deliveries&#13;
    attended by personnel trained to give the necessary supervision, care,&#13;
    and advice to women during pregnancy, labor and the postpartum period,&#13;
    to conduct deliveries on their own, and to care for newborns. (World Health&#13;
    Organization)&#13;
&#13;
Carbon dioxide emissions are emissions stemming from the burning of fos-&#13;
    sil fuels and the manufacture of cement. They include carbon dioxide pro-&#13;
    duced during consumption of solid, liquid, and gas fuels and gas flaring.&#13;
    (Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center)&#13;
&#13;
Cash surplus/deficit is revenue (including grants) minus expense, minus net&#13;
    acquisition of nonfinancial assets. In the earlier version nonfinancial&#13;
    assets were included under revenue and expenditure in gross terms. This&#13;
    is the closest to the earlier overall budget balance (still missing is the lend-&#13;
    ing minus repayments which have been brought below as a financing item&#13;
    under net acquisition of financial assets). (International Monetary Fund)&#13;
&#13;
Central government revenue is cash receipts from taxes, social contributions,&#13;
    and other revenue such as fines, fees, rent, and income from property&#13;
    sales. Grants are also considered revenue but are excluded here.&#13;
&#13;
Child immunization, measles is the percentage of children ages 12­23&#13;
    months at the time of the survey who received a dose of measles vaccine&#13;
    by 12 months, or at any time before the interview date. A child is consid-&#13;
    ered adequately immunized against measles after receiving one dose of&#13;
    vaccine. (World Health Organization and United Nations Children's Fund)&#13;
&#13;
Child malnutrition is the percentage of children under age five whose weight&#13;
    for age are more than two standard deviations below the median for the&#13;
    international reference population ages 0­59 months. The reference pop-&#13;
    ulation, adopted by the World Health Organization in 1983, is based on&#13;
    children from the United States, who are assumed to be well nourished.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Little Green Data Book 2005 is a
            pocket edition of the World Development Indicators (WDI)
            2005. It is intended as a quick reference tool for users of
            the WDI 2005 book and CD-ROM and WDi Online, our electronic
            subscription database. Together, they cover more than 600
            indicators and span of 40 years. The 207 country pages in
            the Little Data Book presents the latest available data of
            World Bank member countries and other economies with
            populations of more than 30,000. The 14 summary pages cover
            regional and income group aggregates. The data in this book
            are for 1990, 2001, and 2003, or the most recent year for
            which data are available, unless otherwise noted in the
            glossary. 1) Growth rates are proportional changes from the
            previous year, unless otherwise noted; 2) Regional
            aggregates include data for low- and middle-income economies
            only; 3) Figures in italics indicate data for years, or
            periods other than those specified. Like the World
            Development Indicators 2005, this edition of The Little Data
            Book uses terminology in line with the 1993 System of
            National Accounts (SNA). In particular, gross national
            product (GNP) is replaced by gross national income (GNI).
            Since 2003, the selection of indicators in these pages has
            been updated to include some of those being used to monitor
            progress toward the Millennium Development Goals.
