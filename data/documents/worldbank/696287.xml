1. JUNIOR SECONDARY EDUCATION ISSUES IN FIVE&#13;
SUMATRA PROVINCES: DI ACEH, WEST SUMATRA,&#13;
JAMBI, SOUTH SUMATRA, AND LAMPUNG&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1   Over the last 25 years, the Government of Indonesia has demonstrated a strong&#13;
commitment to education and as a result, the country has made impressive gains.  The&#13;
Government led a substantial school building program and enrollment drive in the 1970s (SD&#13;
INPRES) sharply increasing primary school enrollment. The gross enrollment rate stood at 75&#13;
percent in the early 1970s but had increased to about 90 percent by the end of that decade. Since&#13;
the mid-1980s, gross enrollment rates have exceeded 100 percent. The effort is not complete&#13;
because of quality concerns and the need to increase retention rates, but the achievements at the&#13;
primary level have been substantial in this diverse and far-flung archipelago.&#13;
1.2   The Government of Indonesia (GOI) is looking to future needs, and has reiterated its&#13;
commitment to a proactive program in the future with expansion of junior secondary education&#13;
as a priority. While maintaining its commitment to primary education, the Government is aiming&#13;
for universal basic education (years 1-9) coverage, to meet the human resource requirements for&#13;
transforming the economy from one based on natural resources to one based more on industry&#13;
and technology.&#13;
1.3   The decision to expand junior secondary education participation as rapidly as feasible is&#13;
justified for several reasons. First, expansion appears to be a precondition for the rapid growth of&#13;
the Indonesian economy in the medium term. Recent research on the development of East Asian&#13;
economies indicates that with the achievement of near universal primary education, secondary&#13;
(junior and senior) education has had a strong impact on economic growth. Secondary education&#13;
plays the role of providing educated entrants to the labor force, enhancing the trainability of&#13;
workers, and providing qualified inputs into higher levels of education.&#13;
1.4   In this regard, the Indonesian economy and labor market is in the midst of a structural&#13;
transformation. Since 1990, there has been a marked slow-down in employment creation in&#13;
agriculture and an acceleration in the rate of growth of job creation in manufacturing,&#13;
construction, transport and communication. After a period of wage stagnation in the 1980s, there&#13;
are strong indications of rising real wage rates throughout the country and an absolute decline in&#13;
agricultural employment. If sustained nationally for a decade or so, these trends imply the&#13;
absorption of remaining pockets of surplus labor, and as happened in other NICs, the&#13;
transformation from an agrarian economy to one relying on the education and productivity of its&#13;
workers. Social rates of return to education computed for 1986-92 indicate that returns to junior&#13;
secondary education are the highest among the education subsectors.&#13;
1.5   The second justification for significant Government attention to junior secondary&#13;
education is that the number of school places is still limited relative to demand, despite&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                     Sumatra Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
substantial outlays by parents and a significant private sector response. This inadequacy is&#13;
evident from continued strong demand for generally more costly and often lower quality private&#13;
education, large numbers of unsuccessful applicants to schools, the prevalence of double shifts&#13;
and large classes in schools, and the use of libraries and laboratories for classroom teaching.&#13;
1.6    A third rationale for Government intervention is to assist in removing barriers of cost and&#13;
isolation that keep many of the rural poor out of school. In rural Sumatra, for example, total&#13;
expenditure per junior secondary student is equivalent to approximately 86 percent of per capita&#13;
expenditure in households of the lowest quintile. Junior secondary education is therefore beyond&#13;
the reach of many of the poor and near poor. The opportunity costs of keeping children in&#13;
school exacerbate the problem. Expansion of junior secondary education, especially in remote&#13;
rural and fast growing areas with low enrollment rates will be of direct benefit to the poor,&#13;
especially girls who are sometimes disadvantaged in these areas.&#13;
1.7    A fourth rationale relates to likely externalities associated with investments in secondary&#13;
education. Research from other countries has pointed to externalities such as reduced fertility&#13;
and child mortality and improved nutritional status that correlate with female secondary&#13;
education. For Indonesia, survey results indicate that a mother's education is an important&#13;
determinant of prenatal care utilization: more than 90 percent of women with junior secondary&#13;
education use prenatal care, in contrast to only 75 percent of women with some primary&#13;
education. Furthermore, analysis of nutritional status in Indonesia finds a strong effect of&#13;
maternal education on children's nutritional status: for women with between zero and five years&#13;
of education, an additional year of education has no impact on the child's nutritional status,&#13;
while, among women with six to twelve years of education (or more), an additional year of&#13;
education improves nutritional status significantly.&#13;
1.8    The role of the Government would therefore be to (a) help expand the number of school&#13;
places through a combination of direct investment and measures to stimulate further private&#13;
sector/community participation in the provision of school places; (b) improve the teaching -&#13;
learning quality of the existing and new junior secondary schools; and (c) ensure that the poor&#13;
are given increased opportunity to participate in the expansion process.&#13;
Sector Financing Plan&#13;
1.9    Achieving universal nine-year basic education will require significant additional public&#13;
resources to be directed to the education sector overall and to basic education in particular.&#13;
Estimates of the total costs of the junior secondary expansion program come to approximately&#13;
$7.6 billion to be implemented over a 15-year period. The cost estimates assume that the private&#13;
sector will maintain its share of total enrollment of about 40 percent. Additional financing of an&#13;
average $120 million during the next ten years of expansion (assuming 6 percent p.a. growth of&#13;
the budget) would be required, implying that the budgetary allocation to junior secondary&#13;
education would need to increase from the current 13 percent of the education budget to&#13;
approximately 16 percent in the next few years. Overall, Indonesia would need to increase its&#13;
allocation to education as a proportion of GDP by approximately 0.2 percent (this does not take&#13;
into account, however, increases in other education subsectors, which may equally be required).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
StaffAppraisal Report                               3&#13;
1.10 Government has demonstrated its commitment to expansion of junior secondary&#13;
education through increases in its education investments. In its most recent budget allocations&#13;
(1996/97) the education sector budget was increased by 20 percent, one of the highest increases&#13;
amongst all sectors. The budget for junior secondary education saw a 24 percent rise over last&#13;
year's budget allocation. GOI is also requesting help from donors, including the World Bank, to&#13;
close the financing gap.&#13;
Structure of the Education System&#13;
1.11   The Indonesian education system consists of a six-year primary school cycle, junior and&#13;
senior secondary school cycles of three years each, and a postsecondary system ranging from one&#13;
to six years. Primary education is largely the domain of Government: nearly five out of six&#13;
pupils are enrolled in public schools. Private schooling plays a much greater role in secondary&#13;
education. Private schools account for 41 percent of enrollment in junior secondary education&#13;
and 54 percent in senior secondary. Junior secondary education is provided through 8,712 public&#13;
(46 percent) and 10,279 private (54 percent) general junior secondary schools (SMP). The&#13;
Ministry of Religious Affairs (MORA) administers the 582 public and 7,547 private madrasah&#13;
tsanawiyah muslim schools (MTs) at the junior secondary level. At the senior secondary level,&#13;
3,241 public and 10,380 private schools enroll a total of 4.2 million students, for a gross&#13;
enrollment rate of 34 percent.&#13;
1.12   When a private junior secondary school is established, it is "registered" and evaluated&#13;
after graduating its first students. Private schools can advance in accreditation from"registered"&#13;
to "recognized" and finally to the status of "equivalent" to public schools. Most equivalent&#13;
schools are owned and operated by religious organizations. Registered and recognized schools&#13;
are in general owned and operated by teachers' associations and other nonprofit organizations&#13;
(yayasans), although some are owned by religious organizations or small communities. Most&#13;
registered schools are owned and operated by small rural communities that do not have a public&#13;
school nearby. Almost invariably, schools established by communities aspire to complete&#13;
Government takeover, while private yayasans often prefer partial Government support so they&#13;
can maintain control. Schools established by teachers' associations often use public school&#13;
facilities after hours and employ public school teachers as instructors.&#13;
B.    SECTOR ISSUES AND NATIONAL INITIATIVES&#13;
1.13   Despite high gross enrollment rates, about 22 percent of primary school pupils, especially&#13;
in the more difficult remote areas, do not complete the full six years of education. Universal&#13;
nine-year education, however, depends on improving the efficiency of the primary system and&#13;
producing an expanded pool of candidates for junior secondary school. The Government has&#13;
started addressing this issue through a series of initiatives, including the Primary Education&#13;
Quality Improvement Project (Ln. 3448-lND) which is piloting measures for improving&#13;
education quality.&#13;
1.14  In spite of the constraints to access and quality at the junior secondary level, Indonesia&#13;
has made great strides in gender equality in both primary and junior secondary education. Only&#13;
slightly fewer girls than boys are enrolled in school at the national level. Girls also have lower&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4                     Sumatra Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
drop-out and repeater rates than boys and are often higher achievers. However, rural conditions&#13;
similar to those which present obstacles to the development of junior secondary education also&#13;
adversely affect the participation of girls. When schools are located a long way from homes,&#13;
parents are less willing to let their daughters commute long distances or to undertake the costly&#13;
expenditures of relocation to urban areas.&#13;
1.15  In addition to access and quality, all provinces face new and existing management&#13;
challenges as a result of the deconcentration of tasks from the center to the provinces, a process&#13;
this project will support. For historical and political reasons, public administration in Indonesia&#13;
has been highly centralized and decision making is tightly controlled by central Government in&#13;
Jakarta. The center has traditionally set objectives for education expansion and development,&#13;
with few inputs from the provinces. However, the differences of local conditions in each province&#13;
and district, accentuated by the great distances of the outer islands from the administrative center,&#13;
make it increasingly difficult for central administration to devise and implement satisfactory&#13;
solutions to local problems. Although Jakarta will retain a significant role in providing policy&#13;
guidelines and promoting regional equity and overall economic development, the Government has&#13;
decided gradually to devolve authority to the provinces and districts. This devolution will result in&#13;
a deconcentration of the functions of the MOEC to provincial (Kanwil) and district&#13;
(Kandep/Kanin) education offices.&#13;
Initiatives Related to Access&#13;
1.16   GOI is aware of these problems and a number of initiatives have been put in place to&#13;
address them. To improve access, the policy of establishing a minimum size of nine classrooms&#13;
for Government schools, which has prevented opening schools in small communities, is being&#13;
changed to make it easier for schools with fewer classrooms to be built.&#13;
1.17   Private schools supported by local communities, private educational foundations and&#13;
religious groups account for about 40 percent of total enrollment at the junior secondary level.&#13;
GO! supports these schools through a variety of measures, including provision of teachers, but&#13;
they are generally of lower quality and cost more to parents. The low quality in these schools is&#13;
explained by poor quality teachers and  scarcity of educational materials.  Unit costs of&#13;
operations in these schools is, however, lower than in public schools. Current and proposed GOI&#13;
support for private education would help maintain or increase its share of enrollment and&#13;
improve quality. In the more southern provinces of Sumatra (Jambi, South Sumatra and&#13;
Lampung), private schools are responsible for 30-50% of enrollment; in Aceh and West&#13;
Sumatra, however, only for about 17%.&#13;
1.18  In some sparsely populated areas, regular schools still will be far away for most students.&#13;
The SMP Terbuka ("open SMP") programs have been established to meet the needs of students&#13;
who cannot attend regular schools because of distance or high direct and opportunity costs.&#13;
These are non-fee-paying schools, and students attend afternoon classes one or more times a&#13;
week, usually at a junior secondary school, supplemented by tutorials in their villages.&#13;
1.19   To assist rural families who cannot afford to pay for education, GOI has established a&#13;
scholarship program for children of low economic background and satisfactory academic&#13;
achievement. This program covers all costs related to junior secondary education; within the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
StaffAppraisal Report                               5&#13;
eligible group, priority is given to children from remote areas, orphans, and girls. GOI plans to&#13;
expand this program, to improve its effectiveness.&#13;
Initiatives Related to Quality&#13;
1.20   Various initiatives have also been introduced to improve the quality of junior secondary&#13;
education, including efforts to bring good teachers to underserved areas. Although there is an&#13;
excess number of teachers in the aggregate, there is an unequal distribution of teachers between&#13;
urban and rural areas within provinces because most rural teaching positions are considered&#13;
undesirable. To address this issue of shortages of (particularly core subject) teachers in rural and&#13;
remote areas, "contract teachers" are being proposed in rural schools in core academic areas.&#13;
Some rural communities have also provided their teachers with dormitories. In addition, the&#13;
Government is already providing some financial compensation for service in hardship areas.&#13;
Over the longer term, local recruitment is one practice that will help to keep teachers in rural&#13;
areas.&#13;
1.21   Developed from an initiative taken by the subject teacher quality improvement forum&#13;
(MGMP), an in-service teacher training program called PKG was introduced in 1983 to improve&#13;
the subject-matter knowledge and skills of teachers. This program was highly successful in&#13;
improving the pedagogical skills of teachers in the selected subject areas and created a positive&#13;
attitude among teachers where it was provided. There were however some serious shortcomings&#13;
of the program. The subject-matter knowledge of teachers was not fully addressed, development&#13;
of skills in identifying learning difficulties was neglected, and teachers in rural areas could not be&#13;
covered because of high costs and logistical difficulties. Training was provided every weekend&#13;
followed by classroom visits, and trainees were supposed to develop their own materials. Some&#13;
of the rural teachers who could be reached could not take full advantage of the program because&#13;
of weak qualifications. Revitalization of content and decentralization of the PKG and MGMP&#13;
system to the district level and the systematic involvement of regional MOEC staff, including&#13;
supervisors and principals in the training program, would help address this issue.&#13;
C.  JUNIOR SECONDARY EDUCATION IN THE SUMATRA PROVINCES&#13;
General Description of Project Provinces&#13;
1.22   The Sumatra Junior Secondary Education Project covers five of the country's 27&#13;
provinces: (a) DI Aceh, (b) West Sumatra, (c) Jambi, (d) South Sumatra, and (e) Lampung.&#13;
Other recently approved projects are the East Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
and the Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project. The project provinces face&#13;
challenges in the provision of junior secondary education that are common to all provinces in&#13;
Indonesia, though not to the same extent. These challenges are (a) to expand equitable access to&#13;
junior secondary education; (b) to improve the quality of education throughout the provinces;&#13;
and (c) to make education management more efficient as the provinces assume increased&#13;
responsibility. Access is restricted mainly by the lack of places; high direct and opportunity&#13;
costs; and great distances and limited transportation networks in some provinces. In some&#13;
instances, parents in very remote or difficult areas do not express interest in junior secondary&#13;
education because they think it is beyond their reach. The most important factors affecting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6                         Sumatra Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
quality and internal efficiency are: teacher knowledge and skills; the availability of textbooks,&#13;
teaching materials, and equipment; the curriculum; pedagogical supervision; the flexibility of the&#13;
school calendar; school management; and examinations and educational assessment.&#13;

1.23    The five project provinces have populations of about three to seven million each,&#13;
accounting each for less than 4% of the total population in Indonesia, and less than 12% in the&#13;
aggregate. Except for Lampung, (at 181 people per km 2), population density is lower than in the&#13;
country nationally, with substantial remote and sparsely populated areas in all provinces.&#13;

Staff,Appraisal Report                               7&#13;
Population growth, however, over the last ten years is higher than for Indonesia as a whole, due&#13;
to higher than average fertility rates and in-migration from Java in most of these provinces&#13;
(except West Sumatra).&#13;
1.24 All five provinces remain predominately rural and agriculture still accounts for two-&#13;
thirds or more of total employment, while industry accounts for 18 to 20%, compared to 32%&#13;
nationally. Average GDP growth per year for the five provinces remains around the national&#13;
average, while GDP per capita (without oil) for 1993, however, in all provinces is below the&#13;
national average (from Rp. 803,000 for Lampung, to Rp. 1,302,000 for Aceh, against Rp.&#13;
1,436,000 nationally). With regard to the incidence of poverty, the provinces are similar to the&#13;
national average, while calorie and protein consumption are at the national average or better. As&#13;
is the case in the rest of the country, the poverty incidence has been declining.&#13;

8                     Sumatra Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
1.25   A number of common constraints bear on further development of junior secondary&#13;
education in the five project provinces on Sumatra island, reflecting the geographic and&#13;
economic conditions of these provinces. With regard to primary and junior secondary education,&#13;
these provinces exhibit the following similar characteristics (See Table 1.2):&#13;
In primary schools:&#13;
*      A gross enrollment rate as high or higher than the national average.&#13;
*      A repetition rate higher than the national average and a lower than average&#13;
retention rate.&#13;
In junior secondary schools:&#13;
*      Gross enrollment rates lower than the national average for the three southern&#13;
provinces (Jambi, South Sumatra and Lampung), but higher for Aceh and West&#13;
Sumatra.&#13;
*      Similarly, lower transition rates from  primary schools for the same three&#13;
provinces vs. higher ones for the last two.&#13;
*      Wide differences between provinces in drop-out and repetition rates.&#13;
Generally, the education programs in these provinces face the following challenges:&#13;
(a)    All provinces have in varying degrees remote-access and sparsely populated&#13;
areas in mountainous regions, swamp areas and forested islands, making it&#13;
difficult to provide access widely through regular schools. Alternatives, such as&#13;
SMP Terbuka, are therefore appropriate.&#13;
(b)    The existence of substantial remote and rural areas has resulted in a particularly&#13;
severe problem of imbalance in teacher distribution, with rural schools lacking&#13;
teachers in all provinces.&#13;
(c)    The three southern provinces, Jambi, South Sumatra and Lampung, are subjected&#13;
to heavy and continuous in-migration from Java, both planned and spontaneous.&#13;
Education administrators need to be especially skilled in school expansion&#13;
planning under these conditions.&#13;
(d)    For junior secondary education, enrollments and other indicators are generally&#13;
below the national averages, although not by much, perhaps reflecting the more&#13;
difficult geographic conditions. These provinces, therefore, will need to make a&#13;
greater effort in reaching the targets.&#13;
DI ACEH&#13;
1.26   DI Aceh is located on the northern tip of the island of Sumatra and facing northern&#13;
Malaysia. From the perspective of the project, what distinguishes this province is:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
StaffAppraisal Report                              9&#13;
*     In line with higher average household incomes and living standards, a better than&#13;
average education: some 36% of the labor force is educated at junior secondary&#13;
school level and above, compared with only 27% for the country as a whole.&#13;
*     As a result of higher family income and parental educational attainment, the&#13;
demand for junior secondary school is likely to remain high.&#13;
*     In primary education, Aceh is ahead of the country, with 99% of its primary&#13;
school age population enrolled in this cycle compared with 96% for the country&#13;
as a whole.&#13;
*     The primary-junior secondary school transition rate was over 78% compared&#13;
with 67% for the country as whole. However, due to the lower completion rate at&#13;
primary school, the junior secondary school enrollment rates were similar to&#13;
those of the country as a whole, at 59% for the gross enrollment rate, and 45%&#13;
for the net enrollment rate.&#13;
*     Access to junior secondary schools for the remote population living away from the&#13;
populated coastal areas is a problem.&#13;
WEST SUMATRA&#13;
1.27   West Sumatra is composed of three distinct regions, a volcanic highland, a long coastal&#13;
plain which is swampy in places and cultivated in others, and a string of forested islands lying&#13;
about 100 km offshore. Distinguishing characteristics of this province are:&#13;
*     Out-migration of 1.78 per thousand in 1980-90, with population density over the&#13;
1980-90 period increasing by less than the country average, and a population&#13;
growth rate, at 1.6% p.a. lower than the country average.&#13;
*     Some 33% of the labor force is educated at junior secondary school level and&#13;
above, compared with only 27% for the country as a whole. Similarly, illiteracy&#13;
rates are among the lowest in the country, at 8% versus 14% for Indonesia.&#13;
*     A diverse physical environment of the province and the presence of a large island&#13;
population resulting in uneven enrollment levels.&#13;
*     A high primary school repetition rate at 10%, compared with the country average&#13;
of 7.6%, perhaps due to children absenteeism in this mountainous province.&#13;
*     A primary-junior secondary school transition rate of 71% compared with 67%&#13;
nationally, with a high enrollment rate of 67% versus 58%.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                    Sumatra Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
JAMBI&#13;
1.28   The sparsely populated province of Jambi consists of a lowland basin of dense jungle,&#13;
peat bogs and swamps, drained by Sumatra's longest river, the Batang Hari, and its tributaries.&#13;
Distinguishing characteristics of this province are:&#13;
*      Vigorous in-migration (10.8 per thousand in 1980-90) with population density&#13;
increasing by 40% and high population growth rate.&#13;
*      Illiteracy rates are among the lowest in the country, at 7%  versus 14%  for&#13;
Indonesia.&#13;
*     Jambi's primary school net enrollment rate increased by about 8% in the 1991-92 to&#13;
1994-95 period, presumably because of the continuous arrival of migrant families&#13;
into the province, resulting in a significant improvement in the primary school&#13;
completion rate.&#13;
*      Low junior secondary education enrollment rates, due to the difficult terrain and&#13;
rapidly expanding population due to in-migration. (Note: Because of the large flow&#13;
of migrants into Jambi, educational statistics are difficult to interpret, particularly&#13;
levels and trends in enrollment rates.)&#13;
SOUTH SUMATRA&#13;
1.29   South Sumatra is the most populated of the five project provinces. Significant&#13;
characteristics from the project's perspective are:&#13;
*      Due to substantial in-migration from  Java (5.2 per thousand in 1980-90),&#13;
population density increased over the 1980-90 period by more than a third, and&#13;
population growth rate increased, at 3.1% p.a., much higher than the country&#13;
average of 2.0% in this period.&#13;
*     A lower-than-average performance in Primary Education on all indicators: Net&#13;
Enrollment Rate of 94.3, completion rate of 71.9, drop-out rate of 4.9 and&#13;
repetition rate of 9.1.&#13;
*     Junior secondary school gross enrollment rates lower than for Indonesia, at 52%&#13;
versus 58%.&#13;
LAMPUNG&#13;
1.30   Lampung occupies the southern most tip of Sumatra, separated from Java by the shallow&#13;
Sunda straits. From the project's perspective, distinguishing characteristics are:&#13;
*      A densely populated province similar in nature to Java, 181 persons per square&#13;
kilometer in 1990, three times the average for Sumatra, and twice the Indonesian&#13;
average of 93 persons per square kilometer nevertheless continuing to experience&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                          11&#13;
in-migration from Java (1.8 per thousand in 1980-90), with population density&#13;
over the 1980-90 period increasing by over 30%.&#13;
*     Per capita income, at $400 p.a., is only 56% of the national average of $718 per&#13;
annum; average household expenditure levels were also 30% lower than the&#13;
country average, and did not rise in the 1990-1993 period compared with a 13%&#13;
rise for the country as whole.&#13;
*     Despite lower incomes and wages, average calorie and protein consumption was&#13;
somewhat higher than the country average, and then levels were maintained in&#13;
the 1990-1993 period. Consequently poverty incidence, at 11.6%, was lower than&#13;
the country average of 13.7% in 1993, and declined by 1.5% since 1990.&#13;
*     In line with lower income and the predominantly rural character of this province,&#13;
the educational level of the people of Lampung is lower than for the country as a&#13;
whole. Some 24% of the labor force was educated at junior school level and above&#13;
compared with 27% for Indonesia.&#13;
*     The province's primary school completion rate, at 62%, was 20% lower than the&#13;
national rate of 82% in 1994-95. Drop-out rates before 1991-92 were unusually&#13;
high at 16%-17%, affecting the output of the primary education system in the mid-&#13;
i990s. With drop-out rates down to about 3%, however, the completion rate is&#13;
likely to improve dramatically in the coming years.&#13;
*     The junior secondary school gross enrollment rates were lower than for Indonesia,&#13;
at 54% versus 58%.&#13;
The expansion of junior secondary education must address the relatively low&#13;
completion rate at the primary school level, which is 20% below the national&#13;
average. Although drop-out and repeater rates have fallen drastically, more may&#13;
need to be done to ensure that all primary school age children actually complete&#13;
this cycle.&#13;

2. GOVERNMENT AND BANK STRATEGY&#13;
AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
A.  GOVERNMENT STRATEGY&#13;
2.1    As part of the Repelita VI (1994/99) program, the Government set the important goal of&#13;
extending access to high quality junior secondary education. This objective is integral to the&#13;
goal of attaining universal coverage of nine-years of basic education by the end of Repelita VII&#13;
(2004/05). To support this goal, the Government has adopted several policy measures and&#13;
strategies: (a) it plans to provide additional resources to basic education; (b) it has abolished&#13;
junior secondary school fees; (c) it is providing free textbooks for all primary and junior&#13;
secondary schoolchildren; (d) it is supporting private junior secondary schools with public&#13;
teachers and other inputs to maintain and even increase their significant enrollment participation&#13;
at this school level; (e) it continues to upgrade teachers' skills for both public and private schools&#13;
through in-service programs; (f) it has started the construction or development of regular or&#13;
alternative schools in rural and remote villages; (g) it has phased out all diploma courses for the&#13;
preservice education of secondary school teachers (junior and senior) so all new teachers at that&#13;
level now need to have an SI (undergraduate degree); (h) it is upgrading existing junior&#13;
secondary school teachers to D-III (three-year post-secondary diploma); and (i) it is extending&#13;
subsidies (scholarships) to capable but poor students to begin or continue junior secondary&#13;
education.&#13;
B.  LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
2.2   Integration of the following lessons from previous Bank projects would help build on the&#13;
exceptional performance of the Bank in the education sector in Indonesia. All the 21 previous&#13;
projects have been judged satisfactory by OED, and they have set the stage for the more&#13;
challenging tasks in this sector. OED Document, No. 9752, Indonesian Education and the&#13;
World Bank: an Assessment of Two Decades of Lending, 1991: a) found that each of the&#13;
previous projects was successfully implemented; b) concluded that Bank support in education&#13;
projects was timely and gave valuable encouragement to the Government; and c) pointed out&#13;
that the projects were successes and achieved important goals, but also indicated shortcomings in&#13;
the quality of education and fragmented management and coordination --issues being addressed&#13;
by the present project.&#13;
2.3    OED Report. The 1991 report has several conclusions and recommendations that are&#13;
relevant for this project:&#13;
Issue: Institution building is basic to the long-term goal of increasing the self-sufficiency&#13;
of the Indonesian education system (p. 58).&#13;
Project response: Increased emphasis on institution building and self-management at&#13;
provincial and district levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                             13&#13;
Issue: Projects must be discussed within the framework of the policy dialogue (p. 65).&#13;
Project response: Regular discussions between MOEC and the Bank on development&#13;
priorities and the role of the Bank related to other donors are instrumental in determining&#13;
agenda for Bank lending.&#13;
Issue: Despite explicit goals, projects have not always achieved equitable distribution of&#13;
project benefits to the poor (p. 68).&#13;
Project response: Several project interventions are specifically targeted to the poor:&#13;
school construction in rural areas, SMP Terbuka and scholarship program.&#13;
Issue: Previous projects (mainly national in scope) were often overly complex or&#13;
underestimated absorption constraints and experience, resulting in unsatisfactory&#13;
implementation (p. 70).&#13;
Project response: The project has been designed with extensive participation from&#13;
communities, existing schools, district and provincial MOEC staff.&#13;
Issue: GOI should spend a greater amount of its budget on education, to achieve the&#13;
necessary quality and institutional objectives (p. 78).&#13;
Project response: Indonesia's education expenditures are 14 percent of total government&#13;
budget; The 1996/97 budget shows an increase of 20 percent over last year, of which 72&#13;
percent is spent on basic education (primary and junior secondary).&#13;
Issue: Despite its support from GOI and the Bank (p.79) role in providing educational&#13;
opportunities, the private system has received limited support from GOI and the Bank&#13;
(p. 79).&#13;
Project response: GOI is now committed to ensuring that the involvement of the private&#13;
sector in junior secondary education is maintained and strengthened. Recent projects have&#13;
helped private schools improve their quality.&#13;
2.4    Lessons from completed and ongoing projects in secondary education. Other lessons&#13;
have been drawn or confirmed by the General Operational Review of Secondary Education&#13;
Projects by HDD. Implementation of the Indonesia Secondary Education Project (Ln. 2472-&#13;
IND) and the ongoing Second Secondary Education and Management Project (Ln. 3158-lND) are&#13;
particularly relevant in this respect.&#13;
(a)    Overall Project Design. The completed and ongoing secondary education&#13;
projects have demonstrated that the expansion of secondary education should be&#13;
addressed through a dual strategy of increasing school places and improving the&#13;
quality of education. The proposed project would include both expansion and&#13;
quality improvement objectives, to ensure continuing demand for education and&#13;
to improve repetition and drop-out rates.&#13;
(b)    Flexibility in the Design of Components.  Attempts to impose standard&#13;
solutions to the variety of conditions in Indonesia (as in all large countries) have&#13;
not been successful, and GOI is working to correct this situation, the policy of&#13;
limiting the size of government schools to a minimum of nine classrooms has&#13;
been reviewed, to allow government schools to be established in communities&#13;

models of junior secondary education.&#13;
(c)    Ownership and Participation. Local communities contribute significantly to&#13;
the development of education in their areas. Stakeholders and clients are also&#13;
well placed to evaluate project outcomes. They know when children are learning&#13;
and how investments in schools are being used. Stakeholder involvement (which&#13;
was emphasized during the preparation process) is critical to fully measure&#13;
project outcomes, to understand how a project is unfolding and to help develop&#13;
appropriate corrective measures when necessary. The project will promote and&#13;
supplement the use of local resources for education by providing assistance in&#13;
kind and incentives for both private and public education.&#13;
C.  BANK STRATEGY AND RATIONALE FOR INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.5    This project, the third in a series of junior secondary education investments financed by&#13;
the Bank, supports the Bank's 1995 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Indonesia, which was&#13;
presented to the Board on March 21, 1995 and updated on June 4, 1996. The CAS endorses&#13;
Government's role towards establishing a regulatory framework and in supporting&#13;
decentralization and participation. In addition, the CAS highlights the importance of continued&#13;
emphasis on human resource development to promote economic growth, competitiveness, and&#13;
structural transformation, and on a more selective, efficient use of public resources. The design&#13;
of the proposed project is also consistent with the Bank's strategy of balanced assistance to the&#13;
education sector, which includes on-going and proposed assistance for (a) improving the quality&#13;
of primary education, including possible interventions in early childhood development; (b)&#13;
expansion and quality improvement of lower-secondary education; (c) quality improvement of&#13;
upper-secondary education; (d) selective interventions in higher education; and (e) an active&#13;
policy dialogue designed to redefine and refocus the Government's role in the education sector.&#13;
Before continuing with further projects in Basic Education in Indonesia, the Board and GOI will&#13;
hold a joint seminar, to discuss future strategy and Bank involvement.&#13;
2.6   The Bank's comparative advantage in supporting junior secondary education is based on&#13;
its long-standing and close working relationship with MOEC. The Bank has engaged in a&#13;
comprehensive dialogue with MOEC that reaches far beyond this project itself, since it has&#13;
helped to: (a) establish a solid conceptual and economic framework for the expansion and&#13;
improvement of junior secondary education and basic education in Indonesia over the next 20&#13;
years; (b) identify the comparative advantages for the Bank's and other donors' role in the&#13;
planned expansion and quality improvement process; and (c) strengthen the decentralizing trends&#13;
toward sub-central levels, province-specific projects, and local ownership. As a result of this&#13;
dialogue, the previous higlhly centralized, uniform approach to project design and implementation&#13;
has been abandoned and has been replaced by an approach that will rest on provincially based&#13;
projects. This approach recognizes the need to take into account specific provincial situations,&#13;
including economic growth trends and prospects, the existing education needs, labor market&#13;
conditions, private sector delivery capacity, levels of poverty, and geographic conditions. The&#13;
Bank has also been an active partner in the discussions on the priorities governing basic&#13;
education delivery, on the role of the private sector in secondary education and on the share of&#13;
Government spending that should be allocated to basic education.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                            15&#13;
2.7   The Bank is a trusted partner in basic education in Indonesia and has substantial&#13;
experience working with the Indonesian Government in this sector. Based on the Bank's&#13;
worldwide experience, GOI sought the Bank's advice on such issues as lower-cost alternatives&#13;
for junior secondary education, how to improve quality and how to tailor the proposed increased&#13;
access programs to local needs. The proposed project represents one in an overall program of&#13;
Bank support for expansion and quality improvements in basic education. Currently, the Bank is&#13;
starting two other secondary education projects (East Java/NTT Junior Secondary Education and&#13;
Central Indonesia Junior Secondary Education) and the Government has requested that the Bank&#13;
provide both financial and technical assistance for future projects.  The junior secondary&#13;
education development program is supported by other donors, including ADB and OECF. This&#13;
project complements the assistance to basic education provided by several ongoing projects:&#13;
(a)    Second Secondary Education and Management Project. This project (Ln.&#13;
3158-IND), approved in 1990, supports: provision of quality inputs in secondary&#13;
schools (teacher training, equipment and books); review and redesign of the&#13;
student assessment system; and redesign of the information management system.&#13;
After initial problems, mainly due to the large national scope, the project was&#13;
restructured to operate in five pilot provinces, with satisfactory results. The&#13;
implementation experience from this project has provided the basis for the design&#13;
of the current project. In addition, the Bank is now very familiar with the issues&#13;
and the agencies involved in this subsector at the provincial level.&#13;
(b)    The Primary and Secondary School Teacher Development Projects. These&#13;
two projects (Ln. 3496-IND and 3979-IND) address pre-service training of&#13;
primary and secondary school teachers respectively.  They complement the&#13;
current project in the preparation and quality improvements of teachers and&#13;
substantial coordination between pre-service and in-service training is achieved&#13;
through the concurrent implementation of these projects. The Bank is also&#13;
heavily involved in ensuring that maximum coordination is achieved between&#13;
Teacher Development Projects and the in-service training components of the&#13;
Secondary Education Development Projects.&#13;
(c)    The Primary Education Quality Improvement Project. Approved in 1992,&#13;
this project (Ln. 3448-IND) provides quality inputs in primary schools in six&#13;
provinces. The issues related to primary schools that impact on transition,&#13;
enrollments and quality in junior secondary schools are being addressed in this&#13;
project on a limited scale. Project impact is now being reviewed, to determine&#13;
the further strategies for implementation on a larger scale.&#13;
(d)    The Book and Reading Development Project. (Ln. 3887-IND). The project&#13;
became effective in September 1995 and provides free textbooks to every&#13;
primary and junior secondary education student in all subjects. Books will be&#13;
provided both to public and private schools. The project provides one of the&#13;
most essential quality inputs into basic education on a systematic basis, and&#13;
complements the Secondary Education Development Projects, which will focus&#13;
on supporting non-textbook educational materials and teaching aids.&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A.    PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1    The project would assist the MOEC in achieving a greater number of junior&#13;
secondary school graduates of better quality upon graduation. This would be pursued by:&#13;
(a)    expanding access to junior secondary education in a cost-effective and&#13;
equitable way;&#13;
(b)   improving the quality of junior secondary education; and&#13;
(c)   strengthening the education management capacity at all levels.&#13;
B.  PERFORMANCE INDICATORS AND CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS&#13;
3.2   Project impact will be assessed using the following indicators (see Annex 10):&#13;
(a)    achievement of project enrollment targets by province (satisfactory if 75&#13;
percent achieved) in new junior secondary schools constructed under the&#13;
project, by project completion date;&#13;
(b)   an increase in student examination scores for core subjects by at least 10&#13;
percent for each subject by the end of the project (on a score of I to 10, with&#13;
current averages between 3.5 and 6); and&#13;
(c)   implementation of at least 80 percent of the annual work program as&#13;
measured by the physical targets and budget spent each fiscal year for project&#13;
and routine activities in each province.&#13;
C.    PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
Project Components&#13;
3.3   To meet the objectives of increasing access to junior secondary education, improving&#13;
the quality of junior secondary education, and enhancing education management, activities&#13;
related to the following components and subcomponents would be implemented selectively&#13;
and in varying degrees in the public and private systems of the five project provinces. The&#13;
total cost of the project is US$144.0 million, including contingencies.&#13;
3.4    Expand Access (estimated base costs of US$78.5 million). To improve access to&#13;
junior secondary education, the project would (a) create a total of 53,520 student school&#13;
places by building regular junior secondary schools with priority for underserved rural areas&#13;
where female participation is also lowest; (b) gradually expand alternative equivalency&#13;
programs by creating 27,600 places with greater quality inputs for those who cannot attend&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
StaffAppraisal Report                             17&#13;
regular schools, and monitor the programs' effectiveness; (c) student and teacher&#13;
accommodations for public schools in rural and remote areas; and (e) finance scholarships&#13;
for 32,600 talented poor students with priority given to girls in public and private schools.&#13;
See Annex 4 for more details on options for increasing access. During negotiations, the&#13;
Government gave assurances that it will (i) select locations for construction in accordance&#13;
with criteria agreed with the Bank and (ii) award scholarships in accordance with criteria&#13;
acceptable to the Bank (See para 6.01 [a]).&#13;
3.5    New schools will be built only in rural areas, where no existing schools are yet&#13;
available, either public or private. School location will be determined based on local&#13;
planning, which will take into account existing SMP schools and the locations of the feeder&#13;
SD schools. Six-classroom schools are preferred in these provinces, since once established&#13;
and filled, they are less costly to run than the smaller 3-classroom schools, which require a&#13;
larger number of teachers relative to the number of students.&#13;
3.6   Improve Quality (estimated base costs of US$35.2 million). To improve the quality&#13;
of junior secondary education, the project would (a) strengthen school teachers' subject-&#13;
matter knowledge and pedagogical skills, including identification of learning difficulties,&#13;
through inservice and upgrading training programs, and support measures to bring teachers&#13;
to rural areas; (b) enhance the learning environment by providing schools with tools for&#13;
teaching and learning, including educational equipment and materials; science teaching aids;&#13;
new teaching rooms; and library and reference books; and (c) provide contract teachers for&#13;
rural areas. All public schools, including schools supported by MOEC and by MORA, will&#13;
be included in the project. All private schools, subject to certain criteria, will also be eligible&#13;
for quality improvement inputs. Criteria for private school inclusion are all schools with: (a)&#13;
classroom size equal or greater than the provincial private school average; (b) own land and&#13;
school buildings; and (c) at least half of teachers as regular, full-time teachers. These access&#13;
and quality interventions would help increase access of girls in areas where gender&#13;
disparities still exist. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it will&#13;
employ contract teachers during the project, in the numbers and locations and with the&#13;
criteria as agreed with the Bank (See para 6.01 [a]).&#13;
3.7    Strengthen Education Management (estimated base costs of US$5.1 million). To&#13;
strengthen the management of the education system, the project would (a) train school&#13;
principals and other administrators in managing schools and providing pedagogical support&#13;
to teachers; and (b) develop managerial and data analysis capacity to allow provincial and&#13;
district staff to effectively handle their increasing responsibilities for education planning and&#13;
management. During negotiations, the Government gave assurances that it will carry out the&#13;
management training in accordance with criteria acceptable to the Bank (See para 6.01 [a]).&#13;
3.8    Project Management (estimated base costs of US$7.3 million). The project would&#13;
support the strengthening of institutional capacities as well as the operational costs of project&#13;
management by the Kanwils and Kandeps. Coordination requirements by the MOEC&#13;
Directorate of Secondary Education (Dikmenum) would be provided under the Central&#13;
Indonesia Junior Secondary Education Project.&#13;

financing (APBN).&#13;
3.10   Alternative Equivalency Programs.  (US$1.4 million equivalent, excluding&#13;
contingencies). As an alternative to the regular schools, support will be provided to establish&#13;
22 SMP Terbuka (open SMP), each enrolling about 200 students, for a total of 4,400&#13;
students. The project would provide the necessary books and equipment for each of the SMP&#13;
Terbuka; it would also provide motorcycles to allow teachers to visit the satellite sites served&#13;
by the SMP mother schools and which are often not easily reachable by public&#13;
transportation.&#13;
3.11   Construction of Teacher Houses and Student Dormitories. (US$1.1 million&#13;
equivalent, excluding contingencies).  In isolated areas, where it is difficult to attract&#13;
teachers or where most students live too far away from the school, dormitories will be&#13;
constructed. The project will support the construction of teacher housing for 23 remote&#13;
schools and 7 student dormitories during the five year project period.&#13;
3.12   Student Scholarships. (US$2.1 million equivalent, excluding contingencies). The&#13;
project would support an expansion of the existing Kanwil-managed scholarship scheme,&#13;
after evaluation of its impact and review of its implementation mechanisms. The scholarship&#13;
would provide Rp 25,000 per month (for 12 months and normally for three years) to selected&#13;
students. Eligibility criteria would focus principally on the family's income level and the&#13;
student's school performance. The scholarship would be offered to 5,300 SMP students in&#13;
Aceh.&#13;

Dikmenum and Kanwil; and (c) school education data management by Kandeps. The project&#13;
would provide technical assistance for the development of the functions, analytical and skills&#13;
training for staff, software and equipment.&#13;
D.  PROJECT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
3.54   The economic analysis conducted for the project consisted of. (a) analysis of&#13;
educational demand and the rationale for public investment in junior secondary education;&#13;
(b) fiscal analysis; (c) review of alternatives; and (d) cost-benefit analysis. Details are&#13;
provided in Annex 1.&#13;
3.55   There are both efficiency and equity grounds for additional public intervention in&#13;
junior secondary education in Indonesia today. It is primarily the poor and near-poor (and&#13;
mostly those in rural areas) who are not enrolling in school and whose participation declined&#13;
in the late 1980s to early 1990s. One of the primary factors explaining the low demand is the&#13;
high direct costs of education. A second factor is indirect (opportunity) costs which&#13;
exacerbated the effect of high direct costs. Coupled with stagnant real wages in the I 980s&#13;
and the effects of cuts in public expenditure on basic education in the mid-I 980s (school&#13;
construction came to a virtual halt), these factors contributed to faltering demand. The past&#13;
two years have seen the reversal of these trends as enrollment rates have risen significantly&#13;
in all provinces.&#13;
3.56   Since investment in junior secondary education is desirable on both efficiency and&#13;
equity grounds, the key questions for the Government are the budgetary implications of the&#13;
expansion and how to expand the system. The budgetary implications of the expansion are&#13;
sizable (8.7 billion; see Annex 1), but estimation shows that the policy is attainable if the&#13;
economy continues to grow at the rate attained in recent decades, additional funds are made&#13;
available to junior secondary including external borrowing, and the private sector retains its&#13;
current significant share.&#13;
3.57   Assuming 6%  per annum  real growth of the budget, the project's incremental&#13;
recurrent costs will take from 2 to 4% of the educational budgets, depending on the province,&#13;
to support investments representing 22.4% of total requirements (See Table 3.1).&#13;

3.58   The analysis of alternatives considered the role of the private sector in the expansion&#13;
program and the fiscal implications of mainly public expansions versus one which made&#13;
room for private expansion. The budgetary implications double in the second scenario (14.5&#13;
billion compared to 7.6 billion). There are additional merits to preserving the private sector.&#13;
First, given the current and projected surplus of teachers, a robust private sector is an&#13;
effective means for helping to clear the market for teachers. Second, Madrasah schools&#13;
(religious schools which currently enroll about 20 percent of junior secondary students) offer&#13;
access to junior secondary in small, poor communities and at a cost that is significantly lower&#13;
than even MOEC-supervised private schools. These schools also enroll a higher proportion&#13;
of girls than boys, reflecting the preference pattern of some families for non-secular&#13;
education. Third, maintaining the share of private schools at the junior secondary level&#13;
establishes the basis for sustaining the even larger share of private schools at the senior&#13;
secondary level (54 percent of enrollments in 1993/94).&#13;
3.59   Beyond the public/private alternatives, the Government has experimented with&#13;
alternative modes of delivering junior secondary education (in respect of the regular SMP&#13;
model). These include: SMP Kecil, SMP Terbuka and Paket B. While not entirely substitutes&#13;
for each other (or to the regular SMPs), and experimentation to improve their quality is still&#13;
ongoing, preliminary unit cost comparisons indicate that gains can be achieved by utilizing&#13;
these less costly alternative models ofjunior secondary education in rural and remote areas.&#13;
3.60   The economic rate of return for the project investment is estimated by province and&#13;
component (increasing access and enhancing quality, but excluding the management&#13;
component). The estimates are obtained by solving for the internal rate of return that equates&#13;
a stream of benefits and costs resulting from the investment over a thirty year horizon. The&#13;
benefits of the projects are derived from the increased numbers of students enrolled in junior&#13;
secondary in any given year, but also include the additional stream of students expected to&#13;
proceed to senior secondary and tertiary education. A monetary value of the benefits of each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28                   Sumatra Junior Secondary Educalion Project&#13;
stream of beneficiaries is estimated using the difference in wages between one level of&#13;
education and the next. Benefits will also accrue from investments in enhancing quality of&#13;
junior secondary. A benchmark assumption of a 15 percent additional wage premium earned&#13;
by a higher quality graduate is made. High returns were found for both quality and access&#13;
components, with returns on quality enhancements generally higher than for expansion of&#13;
access.&#13;
E.  PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND SUPERVISION&#13;
Project Management&#13;
3.61   Provincial Project Implementation  Units (PPIU). The project would  be&#13;
implemented by Provincial Project Implementation Units in each of provincial capitals&#13;
(Banda Aceh, Padang, Jambi, Palembang and Bandar Lampung), and would be overseen by a&#13;
Central Program Coordination Unit at MOEC's Directorate General for Secondary Education&#13;
(Dikmenum) in Jakarta (see Annex 8).  Each Kanwil would establish within their&#13;
administrative structure a Provincial Project Implementation Unit preferably headed by the&#13;
provincial Head of Division of Secondary Education (Kabid Dikmenum), assisted by a&#13;
Procurement Officer, a Disbursement Officer and a Teacher Development Officer. The&#13;
PPIU would be overseen by a Provincial Project Advisory Committee which would be&#13;
chaired by the head of MOEC provincial office (Kakanwil), and would include the provincial&#13;
directors of Secondary Education, Planning, Procurement, and Finance, representatives of&#13;
Dinas and Public Work, and a representative of the provincial office of MORA. At&#13;
negotiations, assurances were received from the Government that it would: (a) establish and&#13;
staff the five Provincial Project Implementation Units in accordance with terms of reference&#13;
acceptable to the Bank; and (b) establish the Central Project Advisory Committees with the&#13;
composition and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, no later than March 1, 1997 and&#13;
maintain them until the completion of the project (See para 6.01 [b]and [c]).&#13;
3.62   The PPIU would be responsible for managing the implementation of various project&#13;
components through the services of Kanwil and Kandep sectors, and would be responsible&#13;
for preparing an annual implementation plan and budget to be submitted to the CPCU. The&#13;
PPIU would also be in charge of producing annual implementation performance reports. At&#13;
the Kandep level, implementation would be insured by a Task Force headed by the Kandep&#13;
Director (Kakandep) assisted by the head of planning section. Kandeps will be involved in&#13;
the following project activities:  (a) selection of contract teacher candidates; (b)&#13;
determination of school locations; (c) construction monitoring; (d) supervision of teacher&#13;
training activities; and (e) selection of scholarship candidates. Appropriate budget support to&#13;
carry out these activities will be made available to each Kandep.&#13;
3.63   Central Program Coordination Unit (CPCU). To support the junior secondary&#13;
education expansion program, Dikmenum will establish within its central structure a Central&#13;
Program Coordination Unit headed by the Director of Dikmenum, assisted by a National&#13;
Advisor, an International Advisor, a Procurement Officer, a Disbursement Officer, a&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation Officer, and project-specific Liaison Officers for the different&#13;
Junior Secondary Education Projects. The CPCU will insure that the overall and annual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
StaffAppraisal Report                           29&#13;
project implementation plans and budgets prepared by the PPIUs be in accordance with&#13;
project objectives. The CPCU will also supervise and provide broad technical guidance to&#13;
the PPIUs of all secondary education projects. At negotiations, Government assurances were&#13;
received that it will: (a) maintain the Central Program Coordination Unit in accordance with&#13;
terms of reference acceptable to the Bank; and (b) establish the Central Program Advisory&#13;
Committee with the composition and terms of reference acceptable to the Bank, no later than&#13;
March 1, 1997, and maintain them until the completion of the project.&#13;
3.64   The Central Program Advisory Committee would facilitate CPCU consultation and&#13;
coordination on major project implementation issues. It would include senior officials from&#13;
the MOEC, BAPPENAS, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Religious Affairs, Ministry of&#13;
Home Affairs, State Ministry for Administration Reform (MENPAN), the State Civil Service&#13;
Commission (BAKN), and all five project Kakanwils.&#13;
3.65   Implementation Schedule. The proposed project would be implemented over a&#13;
period of five years, the completion date being March 31, 2002. The detailed schedules of&#13;
implementation of all project activities (Annex 12), costs by year and components (Annex&#13;
13) procurement (Annex 15), and disbursement (Annex 16) will serve as the basis for project&#13;
implementation and will be updated annually by the CPCU and the PPIUs. The closing date&#13;
of the project is September 30, 2002.&#13;
3.66   Technical Assistance. A total of 1,215 person/month will be required at a base cost&#13;
of US$4.8 million. In all project components, the technical assistance requirements would&#13;
be satisfied largely (90 percent) by national consultants. International consultants (10&#13;
percent) would be recruited only in areas in which local expertise is limited. International&#13;
expert assistance is designed as institution building particularly at the province level rather&#13;
than "substitutive" services directly rendered as part of project implementation activities (see&#13;
Annex 14).&#13;
3.67   Project Launch Workshop. A project launch workshop will be conducted to&#13;
facilitate project start-up activities, familiarize PPIU and CPCU staff and Kanwil project-&#13;
associated staff with project and Bank procedures--especially for procurement--and&#13;
guarantee thereby adequate and timely project implementation. This workshop has a crucial&#13;
importance for project implementation due to the province-based management structure and&#13;
the incipient experience with project-related Bank requirements at province level.&#13;
3.68   Project Implementation  Plan.   For the  day-by-day  practice  of project&#13;
implementation CPCU, PPIU and Kandep staff will rely upon the Project Implementation&#13;
Plan. The PIP will describe in detail and in concrete terms the methodology, procedures and&#13;
multiple steps of project implementation and project monitoring. The PIP is expected to: (a)&#13;
become the key and uniform point of reference for all levels of project management; (b)&#13;
provide users with ready answer for problem solving; and (c) offset the relatively insufficient&#13;
lack of experience with project management at the provincial level.&#13;

Project Supervision&#13;
3.69   Monitoring and Evaluation. Monitoring of project implementation will be the&#13;
responsibility of the PPIUs at the provincial level, and of the CPCU at the central level,&#13;
which has a Monitoring and Evaluation Officer. The implementation progress of the project&#13;
will be assessed through monitoring activities and formative evaluation using the&#13;
performance indicators as indicated in para 3.2 and Annex 10, and will be carried out by an&#13;
independent agency or party. The above indicators will also form the basis of technical&#13;
supervision by the Bank. The supervision plan is summarized in Annex 11. Data from the&#13;
detailed performance indicators for monitoring and evaluation (Annex 10) would be&#13;
incorporated in the annual progress reports prepared by the Government and submitted to the&#13;
Bank. At negotiations, Government assurances were received that it would implement&#13;
policies and procedures to enable adequate project moniitorinig and evaluation in accordance&#13;
with agreed indicators (See para 6.01 [e]).&#13;
3.70   Annual Implementation Reviews. Reviews would take place each project year to:&#13;
(a) analyze the previous year's performance and budget execution against project objectives&#13;
and indicators; (b) analyze the proposed work plan and budget for the following year; (c)&#13;
discuss adjustments to be made in the project's implementation schedule; and (d) analyze the&#13;
results of the project evaluation. The proposed work plan and budget for the following year&#13;
would have to be previously defined at the central and provincial levels and contain a&#13;
detailed description of targets and planned activities. Plans for civil works would specify&#13;
type and schedule of construction and provide evidence of ownership or donation of school&#13;
or dormitory site and of adequate assignment of school teachers and staff. At negotiations,&#13;
Government assurances were received that it will: (a) prepare and present to the Bank annual&#13;
reports on budgets for the next year, by October 31 of each year, starting in 1997; and (b)&#13;
prepare and present to the Bank annual progress reports by June 30, starting 1998, of project&#13;
implementation of the previous fiscal year (See para 6.01 [g], and [h]).&#13;
3.71   Mid-term  Review.  A comprehensive mid-term review would be conducted to&#13;
assess project performance and initial impact in light of project objectives and expressed in&#13;
project indicators and Government policies in addition to review activities normally covered&#13;
under annual implementation reviews. The mid-term review would have a strong focus on&#13;
the formulation and carrying out of sectoral policies, particularly for institutional&#13;
strengthening at both province and district levels, and on redefining the component or&#13;
element where major problems were positively identified. The PPIU and the CPCU would&#13;
be responsible for hiring consultants and preparing the final terms of reference for the mid-&#13;
term review, based on experience accumulated under the project and the final or preliminary&#13;
results of studies, satisfactory to the Bank, and for preparing the report with&#13;
recommendations. At negotiations, Government assurances were received that it will&#13;
prepare and present to the Bank a mid-term report on project implementation and plans for&#13;
the remaining years of the project, by June 30, 1999; and review the report together with the&#13;
Bank by October 31, 1999. (See para 6.01 [i]).&#13;
3.72   Technical Audits. Dikmenum has the overall responisibility to monitor all project&#13;
activities and routine monitoring would be done through annual reviews. However, because&#13;
a large number of contracts would be financed under SOE procedures, an independent,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
StaffAppraisal Report                            31&#13;
qualified firm with external technical assistance would be hired to conduct technical audits&#13;
of key project activities. The audits would cover activities in progress and post reviews of&#13;
completed actions to examine whether implementation of the various project components are&#13;
technically appropriate and to recommend corrective measures if necessary. At negotiations,&#13;
Government assurances were received that technical audits would be carried out every year&#13;
during the implementation of the project in accordance with terms of reference and in a&#13;
manner acceptable to the Bank, and that copies of the technical audit reports will be&#13;
furnished to the Bank for comments no later than three months after the end of each Fiscal&#13;
Year (See para 6.01 [f]).&#13;
3.73   Completion Report. A project implementation completion report is due no later&#13;
than six months after the Closing Date of the loan or such later date as may be agreed for this&#13;
purpose between the Borrower and the Bank. The report to be compiled by MOEC is&#13;
expected to provide a critical overview of project inputs, processes and outcomes. More&#13;
precisely the completion report will summarize (a) project results and impact on the basis of&#13;
indicators; (b) key project activities and management; (c) institutional lessons learned from&#13;
project implementation; (d) the project's financial status; (e) implementation issues and&#13;
recommendations; and (f) the plan designed to ensure the continued achievement of the&#13;
objectives of the project. At negotiations, Government assurances were received that it will&#13;
furnish to the Bank within six months after the project closing date a plan designed to ensure&#13;
the continued effectiveness of the project (See para 6.01 U]).&#13;

4. PROJECT COSTS, FINANCING, PROCUREMENT AND&#13;
DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
A.    PROJECT COSTS&#13;
4.1    Summary of Costs. The total cost of the project is estimated at US$144.0 million&#13;
equivalent (Rp 335.7 billion), including contingencies and identifiable taxes and duties. Tables&#13;
4.1 a, 4.1 b, 4.2a and 4.2b summarize the estimated costs by project component, category of&#13;
expenditure and by implementing agency, respectively. Detailed project costs are given in&#13;
Annex 13.&#13;
4.2    Bases of Cost Estimates. Baseline costs are estimated at June 1996 prices. Costs of&#13;
construction of school facilities are based on the GOI standard unit costsa per square meter&#13;
for such facilities and on review of costs of comparable facilities under other projects.&#13;
Equipment costs are based on recent costs available from other education projects. Costs of&#13;
educational materials are based on prices currently being paid for similar items under ongoing&#13;
education projects. Costs of domestic and international consultants are in line with recent&#13;
education and training projects for appropriately qualified experts. Costs of in-country training&#13;
(in-service teacher training, management training, seminars and workshops) are derived from&#13;
experiences under the ongoing secondary education and management project and vary widely&#13;
depending on the type of training being given and its duration and location, and they are in line&#13;
with the government guidelines. Scholarship grants are about US$130 per scholarship-year.&#13;
Operational costs are based on standard government allowances for honoraria, travel, per diem&#13;
and consumable materials.&#13;
4.3    Contingency Allowances. The project consists of a large number of items of small&#13;
monetary value. As the exact number of these items is not vital to the success of the project, no&#13;
physical contingencies have been included. A contingency allowance of US$17.9 million&#13;
equivalent represents 14 percent of the baseline costs for estimated price increases. Price&#13;
contingencies have been calculated at 8.7 percent per year for local costs and at 2.4 percent for&#13;
foreign costs.&#13;
4.4    Foreign Exchange Costs. Foreign exchange costs are estimated at US$28.4 million,&#13;
representing about 20 percent of total project costs, and are based on a detailed analysis of&#13;
expenditures under similar projects in Indonesia. The foreign exchange percentages for the&#13;
major expenditure categories are estimated as follows: (a) civil works and furniture - 30&#13;
percent; (b) equipment - 70 percent; (c) international consultants - 80 percent; (d) in-country&#13;
training, and educational materials - 15 percent; and (e) domestic consultants and operating&#13;
costs - 10 percent.&#13;
a GOI issues and updates annually the standard construction unit costs per square meter for every district.&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report                                      33&#13;
4.5     Taxes and Duties. Taxes and duties are estimated at Rp 14.3 billion (US$6.2 million&#13;
equivalent) based on the current 10 percent value added tax on all contracts for civil works,&#13;
equipment and other goods and tax exemption of educational books. This would be financed&#13;
fully by the Government of Indonesia.&#13;
4.6     Recurrent Costs.  Under the proposed project additional recurrent costs would be&#13;
generated by the recruitment of additional teachers, maintenance of new school facilities and&#13;
running of the new schools. The annual additional recurrent costs generated by these items are&#13;
estimated from Rp 1.8 billion (for Jambi) to Rp 6.0 billion (for Lampung) at January 1996&#13;
prices, for the different provinces, after the project is completed. These represent between 2%&#13;
and 4% of the education budgets (see Annex 2 for details). Thus, the long-term recurrent cost&#13;
implications of the project in all provinces are small and manageable.&#13;

B. FINANCING&#13;
4.7   The total project cost of US$144.0 million equivalent would be financed by a proposed&#13;
Bank loan of US$98.0 million equivalent, covering 71 percent of total project costs excluding&#13;
taxes (99 percent of foreign and 61 percent of local expenditures). The Government would&#13;
finance the remaining costs of US$46.0 million equivalent including taxes (32 percent of total&#13;
project costs including taxes), as detailed in Table 4.3 below. The provincial budget allocation&#13;
would be done through annual provincial-level development budget.&#13;

C. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.8   The procurement division of the Kanwil Office in each province would be in charge of&#13;
procurement under the general guidance of the designated project manager (Pimpro) in each&#13;
province. Whenever necessary (such as in the case of conducting ICB), the procurement&#13;
division at the provincial level could request the assistance of specialized expertise from the&#13;
MOEC Directorate for Secondary Education (Dikmenum). The construction activities for the&#13;
proposed project would be supervised from Dikmenum by a local consulting architect/engineer&#13;
who would be hired under the Project. This person would be a technical link between local&#13;
monitors in the procurement division in each Kanwil, the CPCU in MOEC in Jakarta and the&#13;
Bank, including in particular its procurement staff in RSI. He/she would ensure, inter alia, that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38                 Sumatra Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
the bidding procedures and contract awards are implemented in accordance with the agreed&#13;
rules and procedures. Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 4.4.&#13;
4.9   The loan proceeds would be used to finance procurement of works, goods and services&#13;
under all project components. All procurement of works and goods would be done in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits"&#13;
(dated January 1995 and revised in January 1996) for the following:&#13;
(a)    Civil Works (estimated total value US$58.0 million equivalent). Civil works&#13;
would comprise construction of over 300 new six-classroom schools, teacher&#13;
houses and student dormitories, largely in rural areas. Individual contracts for&#13;
specific location, which are expected to average about US$200,000 equivalent&#13;
each, are not expected to attract foreign bidders. Because of the large number&#13;
of small size contracts in rural areas, and the need to decentralize management&#13;
of sub-projects, all works would be contracted by national competitive bidding&#13;
(NCB), advertised nationally and following government's procedures and&#13;
regulations acceptable to the Bank. Small works estimated to cost less than&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent per contract, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed&#13;
US$6.0 million, may be awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three&#13;
qualified domestic contractors.&#13;
(b)   Equipment and Educational Materials (estimated total value US$21.7&#13;
million equivalent). Equipment includes, inter alia, computers and peripheral&#13;
for information management at provincial and district offices and selected&#13;
schools. Educational materials include teaching aids and simple kits for all&#13;
subjects for junior secondary schools, library books and modules for SMP&#13;
Terbuka. To the extent practicable, contracts for goods except for library books&#13;
and modules would be grouped in bid packages estimated to cost US$200,000&#13;
equivalent or more. Educational materials and equipment packages valued at or&#13;
above US$200,000 would be awarded through international competitive&#13;
bidding (ICB) procedures, and using the Bank's standard bidding documents&#13;
for procurement of goods, which have already been used under the ongoing&#13;
Second Secondary Education and Management Project (Ln. 3158-IND).&#13;
Locally manufactured goods would be granted a domestic margin of preference&#13;
of 15 percent of the CIF price or the import taxes and duties which a non-&#13;
exempt importer would have to pay, whichever is lower. Contract packages&#13;
valued at less than US$200,000 equivalent and up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$5.5 million equivalent would be awarded through NCB procedures&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. Contract packages for goods (except library books,&#13;
modules and other published materials) valued at less than US$50,000&#13;
equivalent, up to an aggregate amount not exceeding US$2.4 million&#13;
equivalent, may be purchased through national shopping on the basis of a&#13;
minimum of three price quotations. In view of the wide variety of available&#13;
books for school libraries and the relatively small number of copies ordered&#13;
from each book, contracts for supply of library and reading books to the&#13;
schools, up to an aggregate amount not to exceed US$5.3 million equivalent,&#13;
will be awarded on the basis of national shopping procedures with at least three&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                           39&#13;
price quotations, following government procedures acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Because of their availability from single sources only, library books, modules&#13;
and earlier published educational materials, which are of a proprietary nature.&#13;
up to an aggregate amount of US$2.5 million equivalent, may, with the Bank's&#13;
prior agreement, be procured from publishers or local distributors through&#13;
direct contracting.&#13;
(c)    Furniture (total estimated value US$5.6 million equivalent). Most furniture&#13;
contracts are not expected to exceed US$200,000 equivalent. They would be&#13;
procured through NCB procedures acceptable to the Bank. Furniture contracts&#13;
costing less than US$50,000 equivalent may be purchased through national&#13;
shopping procedures with at least three price quotations up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$1.2 million equivalent.&#13;
(d)    Training (estimated total value US$26.7 million equivalent). In-service&#13;
teacher training (PKG Model C and MGMP), guru inti training, upgrading to&#13;
D3 program for underqualified social science and Bahasa Indonesia teachers,&#13;
certificate training, management training for staff of the project provinces.&#13;
districts, and school principals and deputies, seminars and workshops, would&#13;
be organized and contracted out in accordance with government procedures&#13;
acceptable to the Bank, using standard forms of contract acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
(e)    Scholarships (estimated total value US$12.6 million equivalent). Scholarships&#13;
would be awarded in accordance with the criteria agreed with the Bank and the&#13;
Government administrative procedures.&#13;
(f)    Contract teachers (estimated total value US$4.6 million equivalent) would be&#13;
selected in accordance with the procedures and criteria acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
(g)    Technical Assistance (estimated total value US$5.6 million equivalent).&#13;
Domestic  and  intemational  consultants  for  project  implementation,&#13;
procurement, monitoring and evaluation, and studies, would be selected in&#13;
accordance with the Bank Guidelines, "Use of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers and the World Bank as Executing Agency" (Washington, D.C.,&#13;
August 1981). All training and consultancy contracts would use the Bank's&#13;
standard form of contract for consultants.&#13;
(h)    Project operating costs totaling US$3.7 million would be met following&#13;
Government administrative procedures, acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
4.10   Procurement Review. The following are the guidelines regarding procurement&#13;
review:&#13;
(a)    All contracts for goods valued at or over US$200,000 equivalent, and the first&#13;
five civil works contracts in each fiscal year in each of the five project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40                 Sumatra Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
provinces would be subject to prior review by the Bank, whereas all other&#13;
contracts would be subject to random post review.&#13;
(b)    All individual consultants' contracts valued at or over US$50,000 equivalent&#13;
and contracts with consulting firms valued at or over US$100,000 equivalent&#13;
would be subject to prior review by the Bank. Other consultants' contracts&#13;
would be subject to random post-review. However, all terms of reference and&#13;
single-source selection of consultants would be subject to prior review.&#13;
(c)    Annual training plans for each year would be submitted to the Bank for review&#13;
and discussion. Training contracts would be subject to random post-review.&#13;
(d)    Annual implementation plans and budgets would be subject to annual reviews&#13;
and discussions between the Government and the Bank.&#13;
4.11   There would be no contract exceeding US$5 million under this project. Roughly 62&#13;
percent of civil works contracts and 48 percent of goods contracts procured under the project&#13;
are estimated to be subject to prior review. The relatively low proportion covered by prior&#13;
review is due to the large number of contracts expected to cover small amount as shown in&#13;
Annex 15; all these contracts are the responsibility of the PPIUs. The procurement consultant&#13;
will help ensure that the bidding procedures and contract awards are implemented in&#13;
accordance with the agreed rules and procedures. For contracts not covered by prior review,&#13;
post-review of such contracts would be carried out by RSI staff supported by the procurement&#13;
consultant in the CPCU. For new implementing agencies, one out of five such contracts would&#13;
be post-reviewed for the first year of implementation, followed by one out of 20 such contracts&#13;
in succeeding years.&#13;

D. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
4.12   The proposed loan of US$98.0 million equivalent would be disbursed over a period of&#13;
six years (Annex 16). The project is expected to be completed by March 31, 2002 and the loan&#13;
would be closed six months later on September 30, 2002. The disbursement schedule is based&#13;
on the implementation schedule and the standard disbursement profile for education projects in&#13;
Indonesia. Disbursements estimated for FY97 are based on the proposed initial deposit into the&#13;
project Special Account and replenishment. Disbursements would be made as follows:&#13;
Category                 Amount        % of expenditures to be financed&#13;

Total                    98.0&#13;
4.13   Disbursement from the loan for all contracts for goods valued at or above US$200,000&#13;
equivalent per contract, the first five contracts in each Project Province and in any fiscal year,&#13;
and consultant firm contracts valued at or above US$100,000 equivalent and individual&#13;
consultant contracts valued at or above US$50,000 equivalent per contract, would be made&#13;
against full documentation. All other disbursements would be made against statements of&#13;
expenditure procedures for which relevant documents would be retained by responsible&#13;
agencies and made available for review as requested by visiting Bank missions. In order to&#13;
facilitate disbursements, a Special Account in the amount up to US$6.0 million, which is based&#13;
on the need for funds to cover the expenditures on average for four months, would be&#13;
established at Bank Indonesia. This account would be maintained by the Directorate General&#13;
of Budget, Ministry of Finance. The special account would be used for all eligible foreign and&#13;
local expenditures. Replenishment applications to the Special Account will be made on a&#13;
monthly basis, or when 20 percent of the initial deposit has been used, whichever comes first.&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report                          43&#13;
E. ACCOUNTS, AUDITS AND REPORTS&#13;
4.14   Designated government authorities would establish separate project accounts for all&#13;
project expenditures, to be maintained by each of the implementing agencies (Kanwils in DI&#13;
Aceh, West Sumatra. Jambi, South Sumatra and Lampung, and MOEC) for their respective&#13;
expenditures in accordance with sound accounting practices. Accounts and documentation&#13;
supporting the Statement of Expenditures and Special Account would be maintained separately&#13;
by DG Budget, MOF. Consolidated project account statements would be prepared annually as&#13;
part of the project progress report by the CPCU in MOEC, based on the provincial project&#13;
accounts statements.  Annex 1 7 provides sample reporting formats for project account&#13;
statements.  The consolidated project account statements would be audited annually in&#13;
accordance with Bank guidelines, by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The audit&#13;
report would contain a separate opinion by the auditors on1 the statement of expenditures used&#13;
as a basis for disbursement. Certified copies of the consolidated project accounts statements for&#13;
each fiscal year, together with the auditor's statement, would be furnished to the Bank as soon&#13;
as available, but not later than nine months after the end of each government fiscal year.&#13;
During negotiations, the Government provided assurances that the project accounts including&#13;
the special account and SOEs would be audited annually by independent auditors satisfactory&#13;
to the Bank and audit reports would be furnished to the Bank within nine months of the end of&#13;
the Government's fiscal year.&#13;
4.15   The CPCU would monitor progress in project implementation and submit annual&#13;
progress reports to the Bank. Within six months after the project completion, the CPCU would&#13;
submit an implementation completion report to the Bank.&#13;

A. BENEFITS&#13;
5.1    The benefits of the proposed project derive from meeting the high demand for junior&#13;
secondary education where it exists and stimulating demand where it may be constrained due to&#13;
low income and/or credit market failures. The expected outcomes of the investment are: (a)&#13;
increased numbers of higher quality junior secondary graduates; (b) more students at higher&#13;
levels of education as approximately 80 percent of junior secondary graduates proceed to the&#13;
next level and another 30 percent continue to tertiary education; (c) poverty reduction and&#13;
greater distribution gains in the economy as a result of focused junior secondary education&#13;
improvement for low income and rural students; (d) externalities derived from girls' education&#13;
such as lower fertility, increased prenatal care utilization, their families' improved health and&#13;
nutrition status and children's higher educational attainment; (e) greater professional&#13;
qualification of teaching and managerial staff; and (f) better quality data on students' and&#13;
schools' performance.&#13;
5.2    Outcomes (a) and (b) above are expected to result from the increased access and&#13;
enhanced quality that the project investment will ensure. Table 5.1 below presents the stream&#13;
of beneficiaries as a result of access and quality interventions over the next ten years (see&#13;
Annex I for details).&#13;

Impact on Poverty&#13;
5.3   Those not enrolled in junior secondary today are predominantly from the lowest four&#13;
income deciles. The project will reach these poor and near-poor through its poverty-targeted&#13;
sub-components. Approximately 32,600 scholarships will be awarded to poor (and capable)&#13;
students. A total of 53,520 school places, will be built in rural areas, with priority given to the&#13;
poorest villages. Another 27,600 places in alternative programs, which are free to parents, will&#13;
benefit areas where direct and opportunity costs are highest. In all, the project will contribute to&#13;
offsetting the geographical and financial obstacles barring poorer children from junior&#13;
secondary schools, thus reducing social inequality in education access.&#13;

Staff Appraisal Report                            45&#13;
Impact on Women&#13;
5.4    Enrollment figures by province reveal no great disparities between male and female&#13;
participation in junior secondary education in the four project provinces. In 1994/95, females&#13;
accounted for 48-50 percent of total enrollment in the provinces and about 49 percent of the&#13;
cohort populations. Kabupaten-level data suggest that there may be somewhat more significant&#13;
disparities in certain pockets of the project provinces, particularly in rural areas. Distance from&#13;
home to school is one of the main reasons for local disparities- parents are often reluctant to&#13;
allow their daughters to travel far to school. The following components can be expected to&#13;
improve female access to junior secondary schools:&#13;
(a)    Expansion of school places in rural areas, where female participation is lowest;&#13;
(b)    Significant expansion of the junior secondary schools in rural communities;&#13;
(c)    Expansion of SMP Terbuka;&#13;
(d)    Scholarships to low-income students, with priority given to girls; and&#13;
(e)    Quality improvements at private schools, including Madrasahs which usually&#13;
have a higher female enrollment.&#13;
5.5    Although these actions can be expected to continue closing the remaining gaps between&#13;
male and female participation, progress should be monitored throughout the life of the project.&#13;
Impact on the Environment&#13;
5.6    The project would have no direct environmental effects and is classified as a Category&#13;
C project. The proposed project would positively effect the environment indirectly through&#13;
greater emphasis on environmental concerns in teacher training, the content of library books,&#13;
and the development of science education that makes students more aware of their natural&#13;
world.&#13;
B. RISKS&#13;
5.7    The main risks associated with the proposed project are:&#13;
a)    Private sector participation in junior secondary may decline in absolute or&#13;
relative terms iw'hich would have significant budgetary implications for the&#13;
public sector. If the share of the private sector in JSE enrollment declines but&#13;
remains at its current absolute level of about 3 million students nationally&#13;
(which means a decline in relative share from the current 40 percent to about 20&#13;
percent), the budgetary shortfall in the next five years would be twice the&#13;
shortfall if the private sector retains its 40 percent share (see Annex 1, Section&#13;
11 for details). Furthermore, if private enrollment is phased out (except for&#13;
enrollment in religious schools), the budgetary shortfall in the next five years&#13;
would be three times the level of shortfall if the private sector continues its&#13;
significant role. The risk of the decline in the private sector participation is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46                  Sumatra Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
partly mitigated by the involvement of project advisory committees at all levels&#13;
which represent stakeholders interests. This risk would also be mitigated by the&#13;
involvement of project steering committees at the central and provincial levels,&#13;
and the participation of the MOEC Directorate for private education in these&#13;
committees.&#13;
b)     The quality improvement component of the project may prove to be costlier and&#13;
take longer than initially planned, thus postponing or reducing its expected&#13;
benefits. The risks from the labor market side lie in not rewarding higher&#13;
quality graduates with a sufficiently high wage premium to generate the&#13;
estimated economic rate of return of the quality component of the project: the&#13;
base case estimate of the economic rate of return assumes that higher quality&#13;
graduates will reap a 10 percent additional wage premium in the labor market.&#13;
This generates a rate of return to quality ranging from 15 percent for Lampung&#13;
to 24 percent for Jambi (see Annex 1, Section IV).  Sensitivity analysis&#13;
indicates that a 5 percent (versus 10 percent) quality wage premium will reduce&#13;
the rate of return to 17 percent in Jambi, for example.&#13;
c)    Implementation by PIUs in the provincial and district offices operating in an&#13;
institutional environment still in transition to less centralized procedures. The&#13;
issue is to what extent local management can successfully implement these&#13;
provincial projects when budgets and all incentive systems, particularly in&#13;
personnel management, are under central control.&#13;
d)     The lack of, or limited capacity at the provincial and district offices to manage&#13;
all aspects of the project implementation process without previous experience&#13;
with Bank requirements and procedures.&#13;
5.8    The proposed project would reduce the risks of:&#13;
a)    private decline by re-enforcing the mechanisms for school mapping in the&#13;
project provinces, so as to avoid construction of public schools in the catchment&#13;
areas of existing private schools, and by providing support to private schools&#13;
(teacher training, library books and teaching aids) to increase their role in the&#13;
system and including the Directorate of Private Education in the Central and&#13;
Provincial Project Steering Committees;&#13;
b)    slower quality improvement by using training programs which have already a&#13;
long, positive track-record and supporting further improvement of these&#13;
programs (such as PKG for teacher training and the MOEC program for&#13;
teacher-librarian training); providing the PPIUs with detailed Terms of&#13;
Reference;&#13;
c)    ongoing deconcentration by confirming assurances from the Government that it&#13;
is committed towards the deconcentration of responsibilities, and that it will set&#13;
up: (a) Project Implementation Units in each project province to manage the&#13;
project at provincial level in coordination with Kandeps (district offices); and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report                            47&#13;
(b) a Central Project Coordination Unit designed to provide technical assistance&#13;
and to monitor and assess project implementation.&#13;
d)    insufficient implementation experience by providing assistance (launch seminar&#13;
and training, distribution of project implementation handbooks, coordination by&#13;
CPCU, national and international consultants) to the PPIUs; establishing&#13;
criteria for inter- and intra-provincial equitable distribution of poverty-targeted&#13;
components; and provision of regular feedback from World Bank supervision&#13;
missions.&#13;
C.    SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
5.9    The fiscal impact of the project on the four provinces is estimated below (see Annex 1,&#13;
Section II for details). The estimates are based on the following assumptions: (a) the education&#13;
budget in each province will increase at the national historical growth rate of GDP (6 percent&#13;
per annum in real terms); and (b) the share of the junior secondary education budget out of the&#13;
total provincial education budget would also have to increase during the capital-intensive&#13;
phase.&#13;

Sumatra Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE JUNIOR SECONDARY EDUCATION&#13;
PROGRAM AND PROJECT&#13;
The economic analysis conducted for the Sumatra Secondary Education Project&#13;
consists of: (i) demand analysis and rationale for public investment in junior secondary; (ii)&#13;
fiscal analysis; (iii) analysis of alternatives; and (iv) cost-benefit analysis.&#13;
The economic analysis first aims to understand the determinants of demand for junior&#13;
secondary education in Indonesia particularly since there have been variations in the past&#13;
decade and there are significant disparities among socio-economic groups (Section 1). This&#13;
section establishes that the main determinants of demand are household incomes, costs of&#13;
schooling and distance to school; the latter two are variables that Government can affect&#13;
through this project. The rationale for additional public investment in junior secondary is&#13;
investigated subsequently (Section 1), and it is argued that on both efficiency and equity&#13;
grounds, there are justifications for additional public intervention in expanding junior&#13;
secondary.&#13;
The cost implications of the Government's expansion program (Section II) are then&#13;
considered. A key element is the future role of the private sector in the provision of junior&#13;
secondary education. The conclusions reached are that a sizable budgetary effort will be&#13;
required, but that the policy is attainable if the economy continues to grow at its historical&#13;
rate, additional funds are made available to junior secondary including external borrowing&#13;
and the private sector retains its current large share.&#13;
The next question that arises is how best to provide junior secondary education. The&#13;
Government has at its reach both demand and supply policy instruments and within the latter&#13;
several alternative modes of junior secondary exist. These are analyzed in Section 1I1.&#13;
Finally, the costs and benefits of the specific project design are laid out and an&#13;
economic rate of return is calculated (Section IV). The financial impact of the project on the&#13;
provincial budgets and prospects of sustainability is analyzed in Section II.&#13;
1. DEMAND ANALYSIS AND RATIONALE FOR PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN JUNIOR SECONDARY&#13;
Enrollment at the junior secondary level expanded rapidly between the late 1960's&#13;
and 1980's, reaching 63 percent in gross terms in 1988 (47 percent NER).' For the next five&#13;
years, however, enrollment fell to 52 percent (41 percent NER) by 1993 (declining in&#13;
absolute terms from 7.8 million to 7.1 million students). Recent data indicate a resurgence of&#13;
demand in the last two years (GER and NER rose to 58 percent and 47 percent respectively&#13;
by 1995) almost restoring the pre-decline enrollment rates.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 1: Page 2of 17                               51&#13;
There remain significant differences in enrollments, however, among income groups&#13;
and urban-rural residents. In 1994, the net enrollment rate among the top quintile was 66&#13;
percent compared to 25 percent for the lowest quintile.2 Significant differences also exist&#13;
among urban and rural enrollment rates: 62 percent of urban children aged 13-15 years old&#13;
are in junior secondary, compared to 33 percent of rural children. When decomposed by&#13;
income and urban-rural levels, enrollments are low for the poor and near-poor children in&#13;
both rural and urban areas, and the middle income rural children.3&#13;
High direct costs are one.of the primary factors explaining the low junLior secondary&#13;
enrollment rates among the poor and near-poor. Overall, the cost to families of educating a&#13;
child in junior secondary comes to an annual average of Rp2 10,000 (1994). This is more than&#13;
two-and-a-half times the cost of primary education (an average Rp8O,OOO).4 For households&#13;
in the lowest quintile, total expenditure per junior secondary student is equivalent to&#13;
approximately 80 percent of per capita household expenditure. Particularly significant are&#13;
the up-front registration (entrance) fees that parents must pay: in 1994, the average entrance&#13;
fee for junior secondary was Rp47,500, which for those in the two lower quintiles was five&#13;
times more than the registration fee paid for primary education.&#13;
Indirect (opportunity) costs of junior secondary education are significant in rural&#13;
areas. and this exacerbates the effect of high direct costs especially among the poor. Schools&#13;
are in short supply in rural areas which imposes high travel time and costs. The longer the&#13;
travel time, the higher the opportunity cost of schooling, and the more reluctant parents will&#13;
be to send their children to school. Though the difference between average travel time to&#13;
primary school for urban versus rural residents is insignificant, the national average travel&#13;
time to junior secondary schools in rural areas is 50 percent higher than in urban areas.'&#13;
Eamings foregone while attending school can also be significant among the poor.&#13;
Parents' decisions to send a child to junior secondary education depends on the&#13;
aforementioned costs and also on:&#13;
1)     income constraints and credit markets failure. The poor have not only low income&#13;
but also greater difficulty to borrow. Particularly in the area of human capital investments,&#13;
the possibility of borrowing is practically non-existent even among better off families. This&#13;
implies that private demand for junior secondary and, as a result, current enrollnent, is lower&#13;
than its social optimum.&#13;
2)     the benefits of junior secondary education. A tangible benefit associated with junior&#13;
secondary education is the additional labor income that would accrue to the graduate&#13;
compared to someone who left school after completion of primary education. Under normal&#13;
(steady-state) conditions, the wage differentials between primary and junior secondary&#13;
education should reflect the socially optimum  amounts of education in the labor force&#13;
rendering corrective action by the government unnecessary. However, Indonesia is in a state&#13;

5 Ibid. Since travel times are reported by parents whose children are enrolled in school, they are likely to&#13;
underestimate the travel time tamilies face when making a decision regarding whether or not to enroll their child.&#13;
The survey reports average travel time in rural areas of 30 minutes versus 19 for urban areas.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
52                            Annex 1: Page 3 of 17&#13;
of rapid transition. Examining the behavior of the labor market, a conclusion that emerges is&#13;
that formal sector employment is growing relatively slowly (compared to education output)&#13;
and wage differentials have been compressed (due to fast growvth in enrollment among the&#13;
better off).6 These pattems give the short-term but false "signal" to poor families that junior&#13;
secondary education has neither direct wage rewards nor significant employment prospects&#13;
outside agriculture or the informal sector. Indeed, in the period 1988 to 1991 even absolute&#13;
enrollments in junior secondary education declined. This disequilibrium phenomena works&#13;
against long-term investments, such as those in human capital, and justify Government&#13;
support to stabilize short-run variations and to steadily increase junior secondary&#13;
enrollments.&#13;
3)     how farsighted parents are. Parents are making decisions today in light of the fact&#13;
that jobs in the formal sector are expanding at a lower pace than education (hence the&#13;
aforementioned wage compression and also the higher rates of unemployment among the&#13;
educated). However, as the economy approaches the turning point (expected to take place&#13;
within the decade) and as has happened in other NICs, the transformation of the economy&#13;
from an agrarian one to one that relies heavily on the education and productivity of its&#13;
workers would be fast. At that point, corrective action in the form of training is typically&#13;
expensive. For example, it is estimated that training requires six times the costs of basic&#13;
7&#13;
education in order to achieve the same effect on productivity and wages.&#13;
4)     the prospects of continuing to senior secondary. Since junior secondary education is&#13;
the stepping stone for proceeding to senior secondary (and tertiary) education, families can&#13;
give consideration to the costs and benefits of completing senior secondary education. The&#13;
cost of senior secondary is more than double that of junior secondary (Rp460,000 per year)&#13;
and may in turn deter parents from investing in junior secondary. Also, as with the earnings&#13;
of junior secondary graduates, the wage premium of senior secondary education has declined&#13;
significantly over time.&#13;
In short, enrollments in junior secondary education can increase if direct costs of&#13;
education are reduced (such as through scholarships, fee reductions, etc.) and if indirect costs&#13;
are alleviated (e.g. through more and better geographical distribution of schools). On the&#13;
benefit side, though little can usually be done with the respect to how the relative supply and&#13;
demand of educated/less educated workers operate in the labor market, there are policies that&#13;
increase the value of education through improving its quality. Quality also affects the&#13;
decision of parents to enroll their children and a child's progress through school. There are&#13;
improvements to be made on the input aspects of quality, for example, 30 percent of junior&#13;
secondary students still do not have mathematics textbooks. But the more important (and&#13;
complex) area of improvement appears to be in the process of how inputs are combined to&#13;
educate students and the interactions between teachers and students. Evidence on this for&#13;
junior secondary in Indonesia is scant, but findings from research conducted in primary&#13;
schools indicates that the problem may lie in the teacher's inability to identify, diagnose and&#13;
6 See Training and the Labor Market in Indonesia: Policiesfor Productivity Gains and Employment Growth, World&#13;
Bank (1996) Chapter 1. The wage premium for urban junior secondary graduates relative to primary have declined&#13;
over the past decade (while still positive) from 80 percent to 30 percent for males and 166 percent to 60 percent for&#13;
females. (Ibid.)&#13;

address student progress in the classroom.8 Another indicator of quality is the relative low&#13;
scores in reading competency tests of Indonesian students by international standards.&#13;
Externalities. Research from other countries has pointed to the existence of p2ositive&#13;
extenmaities such as reduced fertility and child mortality and improved nutritional status that&#13;
correlate with female secondary education. For Indonesia, survey results indicate that a&#13;
mother's education is an important determinant of prenatal care utilization: 25 percent of&#13;
women with some primary education do not use prenatal care compared to less than 10&#13;
percent of women with junior secondary education.'0 Furthermore, analysis of nutritional&#13;
status in Indonesia finds a strong effect of maternal education on children's nutritional status:&#13;
for women with between zero and five years of education, an additional year of education&#13;
has no impact on the child's nutritional status, while, among women with six to twelve years&#13;
of education (or more), an additional year of education improves nutritional status&#13;
significantly.' '&#13;
The four reasons given earlier on why private considerations may lead to a social&#13;
underinvestment in junior secondary and the externalities from women's education all point&#13;
to the need for greater public involvement. Though we do not quantify the extent of market&#13;
failure associated with these reasons (e.g., does credit market failure affect 10 or 10,000 poor&#13;
children) some additional insight may be gained by looking at social rates of return to&#13;
education that have been computed from  1986-1992. The estimates indicate that returns to&#13;
junior secondary education are the highest among other education subsectors (Table 1).&#13;
Furthermore, while returns for all the subsectors may have declined during this period, those&#13;
for junior secondary saw the smallest reduction.&#13;

In conclusion, there are both efficiency and equity grounds for public intervention in&#13;
junior secondary education. The appropriate public interventions include building school&#13;
facilities in rural areas, providing scholarships to poor students, and enhancing quality.&#13;
8 "Some Basic Number Skills in Twelve Primary Schools: An Exploratory Study", Tony Somerset (1995)&#13;
9 Subbarao and Raney (1993) examine the determinants of desired family size in 72 countries and find that after&#13;
controlling for level of economic development and other factors, female secondary education is highly significant.&#13;
Secondary education for females reduces fertility and mortality in several ways: (i) by enhancing the opportunity&#13;
cost of a woman's time in economic activities relative to child-bearing; (ii) by promoting child health which in turn&#13;
affects desired family size; and (iii) by promoting more effective contraceptive use and willingness to use modern&#13;
contraceptive methods.&#13;

II. FISCAL ANALYSIS&#13;
An analysis of the likely costs and implications for the public budget of achieving&#13;
universal enrollment in junior secondary education by the year 2010 is presented below. The&#13;
fiscal impact of this project is then estimated.&#13;
A. Fiscal Implications of the Junior Secondary Education Expansion Program&#13;
The overall education expenditure in Indonesia is currently reasonably balanced&#13;
across primary (46%), secondary (13%  junior, 15%  senior) and tertiary (13%) levels.&#13;
However, it has been subject to significant variations in the past and has not always been&#13;
protected from  budgetary cuts. Indeed, public expenditure on education has declined over&#13;
time as the graphs below demonstrate.  This is relevant in light of the Government's plans&#13;
to achieve universal nine years of education, which will require significant additional public&#13;
resources to be spent on the junior secondary sub-sector, as well as on primary education.'3&#13;

Achieving universal junior secondary enrollment in 15 years is a formidable task as it&#13;
requires increasing enrollments by 1.8 times (from 7.5 million to 13.5 million). It is therefore&#13;
important to define the role of the public and private sectors. Currently, the ratio of&#13;
public/private enrollment is about 60/40. We evaluate the cost implications of three&#13;
alternative public/private scenarios, that is, universal junior secondary enrollnent is achieved&#13;
in year 20 1 0 and:&#13;
1)     the public/private share stays at its current 60/40 ratio;&#13;
2)     private enrollment stays at its current 3.5 million/year; or&#13;
3)     private enrollment is phased out except for enrollment in religious schools which&#13;
is assumed to remain at its current level of I million students/year.&#13;
Under the 60/40 public/private scenario, enrollments in public schools are assumed&#13;
to increase annually by 240,000 students. Under the other two scenarios the annual increase&#13;
will be 400,000 and 533,000 students. In all scenarios it is assumed that the level of recurrent&#13;
funding remains at its present level of $110 per student/year which implies that there would&#13;
12 The last two years are preliminary estimates.&#13;
13 The exercise conducted here assumes that the graduation rate from primary school will increase from the current&#13;
rate of 75% to 100%. This will require additional investments at the primary level to increase retention.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex ]: Page 6 of 1 7                         5&#13;
be no quality gains. Development costs (building new schools) are estimated to be around&#13;
$900 per additional student. To address credit market failures and enable expansion among&#13;
the poor, it is assumed that 10 percent of additional students in excess of the current 7.5&#13;
million will receive a scholarship of $90/year. Students enrolled in private schools are&#13;
assumed to receive an average annual subsidy of $40 per student to help raise the quality of&#13;
private schools (Appendix Table B).&#13;
The results of the scenarios indicate that achieving universal basic education will&#13;
have sizable budgetary implications. Even if the current public/private ratio of 60/40 is&#13;
preserved, this would imply that public enrollnent increases from 4.5 million to 8.1 million.&#13;
What is required to finance this expansion (whiclh is desirable on both efficiency and equity&#13;
grounds) is a combination of significantly increased allocations to junior secondary&#13;
education, a decline in the funding of other education sub-sectors (such as senior secondary&#13;
or tertiary education) unless there is an increase in the overall education budget (if&#13;
sectoral allocations are to be preserved, especially with respect to primary education), and&#13;
large funding from donors.&#13;
The estimates below indicate that under all scenarios a significant financing effort&#13;
will be required (Table 2). In addition, the difference in enrollments between the three&#13;
scenarios point to a substantial increase in total public costs if the private sector ceases to&#13;
play the role it does today. More specifically, the total additional public funds that would be&#13;
required through year 2010 come to about: $7.6 billion in the public/private scenario; $11.1&#13;
billion if the current level of private enrollment is maintained; and $14.5 billion under the&#13;
pure public scenario (if the private sector is phased out except for religious schools).&#13;

How can the expansion be financed? Let us assume that the education budget&#13;
increases annually by 6 percent, that is, as much as the historic growth rate of GDP. This will&#13;
add nearly $7.5 billion to the junior secondary education budget. Compared to the additional&#13;
public funds required for the expansion, this implies a shortfall of $543 million, $4 billion&#13;
and $7.4 billion under the three scenarios (Table 3). The last two scenarios appear&#13;

unattainable, but the (60/40) public/private scenario also has a caveat: it is heavily front&#13;
loaded. More precisely, additional funding comes to $1.2 billion in the first ten years though&#13;
no additional resources will be required thereafter when the system reaches relative maturity&#13;
(after year 2005 the percentage increases in public enrollments will be significantly less than&#13;
6 percent growth in the budget). The (60/40) public/private scenario though affordable at&#13;
face value, will require additional funding of an average $120 million during the first ten&#13;
years of expansion (and considerably more, as much as $150-$200 million in the first five&#13;
years). The budgetary shortfall (in $ million) is shown graphically in Figure 3.&#13;

The three scenarios would require that the budgetary allocation to junior secondary&#13;
education increase from the current 13 percent of the education budget to approximately 16&#13;
percent, 19 percent and 21 percent in the next few years (and in the case of the mainly public&#13;
scenario it will have to remain at more than 16 percent in the steady-state compared to the&#13;
public/private scenario where the share stabilizes at 11 percent) (Table 4). These figures&#13;
amount respectively to increases of 23, 46 and 62 percent of the current allocation.&#13;

The cost estimates presented above incorporate estimates of scholarships for poor&#13;
students and subsidies paid to private schools. It is legitimate to plan for such public&#13;
expenditure because alleviating supply constraints (e.g., building schools in rural areas) will&#13;
not alone remove demand constraints (that is, the opportunity cost of attending education).&#13;
Assuming that the poorest 10 percent of the additional enrollment each year receives a&#13;
scholarship of $90, the total cost of the scheme over the 15 year period will come to an&#13;
annual average of $29 million in all scenarios (increasing from $3.6 million in 1996 to $54&#13;
million in 2010). In the public/private scenario, scholarships will amount to 6 percent of the&#13;
total public cost of expansion (ranging from 1.4 percent in 1996 to 7 percent in 2010). On the&#13;
other hand, the budgetary savings from phasing out private schools and the subsidy they&#13;
receive (assumed at $40/student) will be only $1.6 million/year. This saving is small (I&#13;
percent of the additional funds) and can prove counterproductive as it will take place at the&#13;
expense of the current co-financing of junior secondary education between Government and&#13;
families.&#13;
What do these estimates imply for the total public budget allocated to education&#13;
relative to GDP? Public expenditure on education is today approximately 2.7 percent of&#13;
GDP. To fund the expected expansion of junior secondary education this figure should&#13;
increase to approximately 3.0 percent and 3.2 percent under the 60/40 public/private and&#13;
pure public scenarios, respectively. These figures assume that allocations to other sectors&#13;
increase annually by 6 percent (GDP growth).&#13;
In conclusion, achieving universal enrollment in junior secondary is desirable on&#13;
both equity and efficiency grounds, but will require a sizable budgetary effort. The policy is&#13;
attainable if the economy continues to grow at its historical rate, additional funds are made&#13;
available to junior secondary including external borrowing, and the private sector retains its&#13;
share.&#13;
B. Fiscal Impact of the Project&#13;
Utilizing the results of the above scenarios and assuming the 60/40 public/private&#13;
case as the "desirable" scenario, the fiscal impact of the project on the five provinces is&#13;
estimated below. The estimates are based on the following assumptions: (i) the education&#13;
budget in each province will increase at the national historical growth rate of GDP (6% per&#13;
annum in real terms); and (ii) the share of the junior secondary education budget out of the&#13;
total provincial education budget would also have to increase during the capital-intensive&#13;
phase (as in the national scenario; see Table 4 above).&#13;
Aceh. Based on the above assumptions, total project costs for Aceh (including physical and&#13;
price contingencies, and taxes) estimated at US$26.07 million, would account for about&#13;
5.5% of the Aceh education budget, on average, during the project period (1997/98-2001/02).&#13;
Incremental recurrent expenditures, which are negligible in the first two years of the project&#13;
increase from US$0.2 million in 1998/99 to US$1.8 million in the last year of the project,&#13;
and stabilize at US$1.8 after the project is completed, representing 2% of the education&#13;
budget.  Thus the long-term  recurrent cost implications of the project are small and&#13;
manageable.&#13;

West Sumatra. Based on the above assumptions, total project costs for West Sumatra&#13;
(including physical and price contingencies, and taxes) estimated at US$28.73 million,&#13;
would account for about 1 0 % of the West Sumatra education budget, on average, during the&#13;

.11. ANALYSIS OF ALTERNATIVES&#13;
A. Alternative Modes of Junior Secondary Education&#13;
GOI has available to it various alternatives to the regular (9 classroom) SMP school.&#13;
These include: SMP Kecil (small schools of 3 classrooms), SMP Terbuka (open/distance&#13;
school), and Paket B (non-formal education). An analysis of their unit costs and effectiveness&#13;
is presented below. Two words of caution are in order, however: (i) the alternative programs&#13;
are not perfect substitutes for each other or even to the regular SMP (see below); and (ii) the&#13;
programs are in an early stage of development, particularly the SMP Terbuka and are&#13;
undergoing continuous revisions, hence their unit costs and outcomes are expected to change&#13;
over time. The analysis below, therefore, is preliminary and will be updated during the&#13;
course of the project.&#13;
Following is a characterization of the main advantages and disadvantages of each&#13;
program:&#13;

Following are estimates of unit costs of each alternative program:&#13;
Unit Cost                   Unit Cost&#13;

SMP Terbuka                          360,000                     100,000&#13;

1/ including amortization of building&#13;
As mentioned above, the three alternatives are not perfect substitutes. SMP Terbuka&#13;
needs a 9-classroom regular SMP school within reasonable distance to function as a mother&#13;
school, providing subject matter teachers. Thus the program cannot be introduced in very&#13;
remote areas where regular SMPs are not available. Paket B is more flexible, but does not&#13;
lead to an EBTANAS examination yet; thus it is not well accepted in all areas. An SMP&#13;
kecil, always accepted despite some of the draw-backs in terms of teachers' quality, requires&#13;
a capital investment (and subsequent maintenance and amortization). In addition, MOEC has&#13;
to find regular teachers willing to stay in remote areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex ]: Page 14 of 17                           63&#13;
Learning Achievement.  It is difficult at present to compare learning achievement&#13;
between the three types of schooling. SMP Terbuka is a very recent program; NEM scores&#13;
exist for only one year, thus there is limited basis for analysis. Paket B has its own&#13;
examination which does not produce any NEM scores; its examination scores are not&#13;
comparable with those of the other two programs. So far, only one comparative study of&#13;
learning achievements has been conducted.14 Students in the sample, subdivided into two&#13;
groups according to whether they had just entered the program (Group I) or they had&#13;
attended the program for one year (Group 11), were administered the same test, which gave&#13;
the following mean test results:&#13;
Program                        Group I           Group 11&#13;
Paket B                           34.0               41.0&#13;
Regular SMP                       42.5               51.3&#13;
SMP Terbuka                        31.1              34.3&#13;
Students of SMP Terbuka scored the lowest grades. The study further calculates the "gain&#13;
points average" for each alternative, which shows that the highest gain was obtained by the&#13;
regular SMP, followed by Paket B and SMP Terbuka.&#13;
The above mentioned study represents one case study and should not be considered&#13;
as conclusive. As the three alternative programs are further developed under the project (and&#13;
other projects such as the Non-formal Education Project), they will be monitored and&#13;
outcomes measured in order to produce more conclusive conclusions.&#13;
B. Public versus Private Provision of Junior Secondary Education&#13;
A second analysis of alternatives is that covered under Section II on the role of the&#13;
private sector. The earlier discussion highlighted the budgetary implications of the expansion&#13;
program if the role of the private sector declines. There are additional merits to preserving&#13;
the private sector. First, given the current and projected surplus of teachers, a robust private&#13;
sector is an effective means for helping to clear the market for teachers. Second, madrasah&#13;
schools (religious schools which currently enroll about 20% of junior secondary students)&#13;
offer access to junior secondary in small, poor communities and at a cost that is significantly&#13;
lower than even MOEC-supervised private schools. These schools also enroll a higher&#13;
proportion of girls than boys, reflecting the preference pattern of some families for non-&#13;
conventional education. Third, maintaining the share of private schools at the junior&#13;
secondary level establishes the basis for sustaining the even larger share of private schools at&#13;
the senior secondary level (54% of enrollments in 1993/94).&#13;

IV. COST-BENEFIT ANALYSIS&#13;
The economic rate of return for the project investment is estimated by province and&#13;
component (increasing access and enhancing quality, but excluding the management&#13;
component). The estimates are obtained by solving for the internal rate of return that equates&#13;
a stream of benefits and costs resulting from the investment over a thirty year horizon.&#13;
Table I presents the rates of return for the two project provinces by component.&#13;
Overall returns for the two provinces are high and those to quality enhancements are higher&#13;
than for expansion of access.&#13;

The remainder of the section explains how the estimates were made and provides an&#13;
indication of the sensitivity of the estimates to some of the underlying assumptions.&#13;
A. Benefits&#13;
Increasing Access.   The project investments are expected to lead to an increase in&#13;
the number of students enrolled in and graduating from junior secondary in any given year.&#13;
Most junior secondary graduates, however, do not stop at this level: nationally about 84&#13;
percent proceed to senior secondary and another 30 percent proceed to tertiary. Thus, the&#13;
stream of output resulting from the project investments is modeled as a function of the&#13;
following five levels of outflows:&#13;
1. Junior secondary graduates;&#13;
2. Junior secondary graduates who proceed to senior secondary and then drop out;&#13;
3. Junior secondary graduates who succeed in graduating from senior secondary;&#13;
4. Senior secondary graduates who proceed to university and then drop out; and&#13;
5. University graduates.&#13;
The total number of the above outflow over a thirty year period amounts to&#13;
approximately 540,000 beneficiaries (Table 2).' The benefits of each of the beneficiaries are&#13;
estimated as the difference in wages between one level of education and the next. No&#13;
additional wage premiums are assumed to accrue to dropouts (they earn the same wage as&#13;
that of the education level they drop from). Provincial data on wages, drop out rates (by&#13;
grade), and transition rates are utilized in the estimation of outflows and benefits.'6&#13;
15 These outflows assume that there will not be a capacity constraint at the senior secondary and higher education&#13;
levels. Give the rapid growth of the private sector at these levels in the past decade, this assumption is not&#13;
unreasonable to make (coupled with some additional public investment).&#13;
16 In cases where provincial wage rates are not reliable, national wages were used as an approximation.&#13;

Enhancing Quality.  Investments to enhance quality will extend to (a high&#13;
proportion of) existing students as well as the new students generated by the project. Over&#13;
the thirty years of the calculation, the total number of quality beneficiaries amount to&#13;
approximately 6.8 million. We assume that a 10 percent additional wage premium can be&#13;
earned by higher quality graduates (equivalent to about an extra $1.5-2.5 per month,&#13;
depending upon provincial wages).&#13;
B. Costs&#13;
Investment costs are divided into those related to increasing access and those which&#13;
enhance quality, for each of the four provinces. They are spread over six years, with very&#13;
little investment in the first year of the project, followed by several years of heavy capital&#13;
outlays and tapering off in the sixth year. A provincial average annual per student recurrent&#13;
cost is imposed throughout the project and subsequently for the remaining twenty-five years&#13;
(amounting to about $100). Similarly, annual recurrent costs for senior secondary and&#13;
university education are added to total costs since a significant portion of the benefits accrue&#13;
as a result of junior secondary students proceeding up the system. On the quality side, an&#13;
increment of $8 is assumed to represent the recurrent cost of additional quality&#13;
improvements. No quality enhancements are factored for senior secondary and tertiary.&#13;
C. Sensitivity to Assumptions&#13;
Simulations were run varying some of the underlying assumptions. Following are&#13;
results for selected provinces:&#13;
Change                                   New rate of return (base casel Table 1)&#13;
Only a 5% increase in additional wage&#13;
premium for higher quality graduates:&#13;
West Sumatra                              11% (17%)&#13;
Jambi                                     17% (24%)&#13;
JS/Primary wage differential by 20%:&#13;
South Sumatra                             17% (16%)&#13;
Aceh                                      16% (15%)&#13;
SS/JS wage differential increases by 20%:&#13;
South Sumatra                             17.6% (16%)&#13;
Aceh                                      16% (15%)&#13;

Increase in JS recurrent costs by 30%:&#13;

West Sumatra                              14% (17%)&#13;
Incremental recurrent costs for quality&#13;
improvement increase form $8/student to&#13;
$12 /student&#13;
Lampung                                   12% (15%)&#13;
West Sumatra                             14% (17%)&#13;
In all, the main variables to which the system appears to be most sensitive are those&#13;
affecting quality. This is not surprising given the large numbers of beneficiaries which are&#13;
impacted by this investment.&#13;

OPTIONS FOR INCREASING ACCESS&#13;
To increase access to junior secondary education, a variety of strategies will be&#13;
employed according to their appropriateness in each of the provinces, including activities to:&#13;
(a) increase the number of places in public schools in order to meet demand; (b) provide&#13;
cost-effective alternative solutions besides traditional schools in targeted areas; (c) support&#13;
low-income junior secondary students through scholarships; and (d) other strategies to&#13;
increase access including the provision of accommodation at existing schools for students&#13;
who live too far to travel.&#13;
Increasing Places in Public Schools. To increase the opportunities for junior&#13;
secondary education, building or expanding traditional junior secondary schools as well as&#13;
developing the small SMP, or SMP Kecil, are the first options. Each of these options will-be&#13;
appropriate and cost-effective only in certain circumstances and will be introduced when&#13;
compatible with local conditions in each of the provinces, as determined by specific criteria&#13;
drawn up by each province.&#13;
Regular SMP and SMP Kecil. Standard building designs for regular SMPs call for 9,&#13;
18, or 27 classrooms. In densely populated areas, regular SMPs remain the obvious solution&#13;
to increase access. However, schools of standard size are too large to serve rural areas with&#13;
small, scattered populations, which nevertheless have sufficient cohort populations to justify&#13;
a new small school. To increase access in these areas, the Government plans to use the SMP&#13;
Kecil, which has fewer than nine classrooms. There would be fewer teachers than the usual&#13;
requirement (at least five subject teachers for this type of schools). The main advantage of&#13;
the SMP Kecil is that it would allow the services of traditional schools to be provided to&#13;
underserved areas with small numbers of potential students.&#13;
In some situations, SMP Kecils are an appropriate and cost-effective option for&#13;
expanding education. General criteria used by the provinces for the establishment of an&#13;
SMP Kecil include: (a) a number of local feeder schools would ensure a minimum of about&#13;
30 graduates per year; (b) except for those students provided with dormitories, the maximum&#13;
distance for students to reach the school should be 5 kilometers or, alternatively, a one-hour&#13;
trip; (c) the school should guarantee the availability of at least three teachers, with&#13;
qualifications among them to teach math, science, Bahasa Indonesia, social sciences, local&#13;
content, and English; (d) rural, remote and poor areas are given priority; (e) priority is given&#13;
to kabupaten and kecamatan with the lowest gross enrollment or transition rates; and&#13;
(f) schools should not be in areas served by an existing public or private school. Once the&#13;
decision is made, teachers would be offered added incentives to teach in isolated areas (e.g.,&#13;
accommodation where appropriate) and education authorities would provide a minimum set&#13;
of teaching aids. An attachment shows the criteria for school location.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Education for Difficult Areas. Some areas have an insufficient number of feeder&#13;
primary students within a reasonable distance, or a large number of young people who are&#13;
not able to attend school at normal times for work-related reasons. In other instances, youth&#13;
do not attend school because parents cannot afford to pay for school expenses. The&#13;
expansion of access by means of regular schools will not catch these potential students.&#13;
Flexible, community-based schooling that requires no separate infrastructure development is&#13;
often part of the solution. At present the Government offers programs, parallel to regular&#13;
secondary education, such as the SMP Terbuka program (open secondary schooling). SMP&#13;
Terbuka programs do not charge fees to students. Criteria for applying these programs are&#13;
similar to the ones for the SMP Kecils in terms of walking distance. A minimal class size of&#13;
about a dozen students would suffice. These programs would target the rural population in&#13;
distant areas, where the establishment of a "small" school is not feasible, and would&#13;
represent the minimum educational service that education authorities needs to provide to&#13;
these areas.&#13;
SMP Terbuka. The SMP Terbuka program, now in operation for only the second&#13;
year, is conceived as a major alternative for school-age children who fail to enter a regular&#13;
public school because of financial difficulties in entering a public or private school, low&#13;
grades in the end-of-level Ebtanas examinations, and/or lack of facilities in the area.&#13;
Students in Terbuka programs are free only at certain times of the day, often in the mornings&#13;
- most of them help their parents in farming, fishing, or home chores. In most cases,&#13;
students attend classes in a regular SMP in the afternoons once or twice a week (a total of&#13;
three to four hours), with teachers from the "mother" SMP school. Four or five other&#13;
afternoons in the week, students do their home assignment, using specially prepared&#13;
modules. in a learning post in the village under the supervision of a tutor.&#13;
Such alternative programs as SMP Terbuka meet a need in deprived areas: they do&#13;
not involve high costs for parents (practically only transportation), are flexible in the timing,&#13;
and do reach a certain percentage of out-of-school youngsters. The main weaknesses are (a)&#13;
the often low qualifications and competence of tutors; (b) the relatively high costs of&#13;
transportation, which adversely affect attendance in some cases; (c) the qualifications of&#13;
students attending these programs, many of whom are bound to be those with low&#13;
achievement in primary schools; (d) a shortage of student modules; and (e) reduced class&#13;
attendance and contact with qualified teachers compared to regular SMP. Some parents&#13;
recognize these weaknesses and reject SMP Terbuka because it is not a "regular" school.&#13;
To improve the quality and effectiveness of the program: (a) tutors would be given&#13;
intensive training (at present Terbuka tutors attend only a 5-day training course, which&#13;
appears inadequate); (b) village chiefs, parents, and community members would be&#13;
sensitized and mobilized to ensure that students do attend tutorial classes regularly;&#13;
(c) transportation costs in particularly difficult or remote areas would be subsidized by the&#13;
Government; and (d) consideration should be given to increasing the length of the program;&#13;
(e) students will be required to pass the Ebtanas final examination like other regular SMP&#13;
students; (f) Government is considering providing subsidies to students with good learning&#13;
achievements to compensate for direct and opportunity costs. The effectiveness of the&#13;
Terbuka program will be evaluated during the project.&#13;

Annex 4. Page 3 of 4                       71&#13;
Scholarship Program. Families in the lower income deciles bear large financial&#13;
burdens when their children attend junior secondary school, relative to the total monthly&#13;
family expenditures (between 40% and 80%). These costs include school registration fees,&#13;
tuition, parental contributions, expenses for unifroms, transport, books and other costs.&#13;
Furthermore, children from poor families attending school incur additional costs in the form&#13;
of foregone income they could earn within or outside the household. Simulations, based on&#13;
econometric modeling indicate that abolishing school fees would raise the transition rate&#13;
from primary schools to junior secondary by 12%; subsidizing all school-related direct costs&#13;
would raise the rate by 32%, primarily bringing into school those children, whose parents&#13;
value education, but cannot afford to pay.&#13;
GOI is currently operating a nationwide scholarship program covering some 27,000&#13;
junior secondary students. The scholarship consists of financial support amounting to&#13;
Rp 25,000 per month for twelve months, an ample amount to cover all school-related costs.&#13;
A new fund distribution mechanism has recently been implemented, with funds being&#13;
distributed through the post office. The fund provides scholarships to children of low&#13;
economic background and satisfactory academic achievement and personality. Within these&#13;
criteria, preference is given to children from remote areas, orphans and girls. The fund is&#13;
operating well, and though very limited, is much appreciated.&#13;
It is proposed in the project, to expand the scholarship program to cover a much&#13;
larger target group, to make a greater impact in bringing poor children into SLTP. The&#13;
current program would be augmented, with adaptations as follows: (a) scholarships would be&#13;
provided to 32,600 students; (b) unit costs would be set at Rp 25,000 average per student per&#13;
month; and (c) a simple monitoring mechanism will be implemented to make sure that funds&#13;
reach the recipients intact and that selection criteria are followed. By project mid-term&#13;
review, the entire program will be evaluated for impact. An attachment to this Annex&#13;
contains details of the criteria for award and monitoring the program.&#13;
Other Strategies to Increase Access. In addition to these strategies to increase&#13;
access by expanding the number of places in junior secondary education, the Government&#13;
has proposed other measures including supporting community construction of student&#13;
dormitories to increase opportunities for dispersed populations in rural areas. In many such&#13;
areas, students have already built, on their own, temporary accommodation, often of poor&#13;
quality and often beyond the financial resources of parents. The project would support their&#13;
efforts. Dormitories would be located according to priority in areas with low enrollment&#13;
rates, where such accommodation is culturally acceptable.&#13;
The lack of teachers in such areas is also a problem, and quality expansion relies on&#13;
attracting and retaining adequately trained staff. Options include increasing the number of&#13;
teachers in underserved areas through redeployment and support for the construction of&#13;
teacher accommodation. In many rural areas, there is no accommodation provided and none&#13;
to be rented. In some cases, teacher housing has been provided especially for single&#13;
teachers. An attachment describes criteria for providing financial assistance for student&#13;
dormitories and teacher accommodation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
72                       Annex 4: Page 4 of 4&#13;
The Project would also pilot a scheme for hiring contract teachers in schools in the&#13;
rural areas. Schools would be given contract positions for teachers, to allow them to hire&#13;
new teachers when a teacher leaves their position without authorization. This would reduce&#13;
turnover and absenteeism.&#13;

secondary by 12%; subsidizing all school-related direct costs would raise the rate by 32%,&#13;
primarily bringing into school those children, whose parents value education, but cannot&#13;
afford to pay.&#13;
GOI is currently operating a nationwide scholarship program covering some 27,000&#13;
SLTP students. The scholarship consists of financial support amounting to RP 25,000 per&#13;
month for twelve months, an ample amount to cover all SLTP-related costs. A new fund&#13;
distribution mechanism has recently been implemented, with funds being distributed through&#13;

It is proposed to expand the scholarship program to cover a much larger target group&#13;
in the project area, so as to make a greater impact in bringing poor children into SLTP. The&#13;
current program would be augmented along the following lines: (a) scholarships would be&#13;
provided to 5,300 students in Aceh, 6,600 students in West Sumatra, 3,600 students in Jambi,&#13;
8,500 students in South Sumatra, and 8,600 students in Lampung; (b) unit costs would be set&#13;
at Rp 300,000 per student per year; and (c) a simple monitoring mechanism will be&#13;
implemented to make sure that recipients receive their full allocation and that selection&#13;
criteria are followed. By project mid-term review, the entire program will be evaluated for&#13;
impact.&#13;
B. Selection Criteria For Scholarship Recipients&#13;
1. The candidate is in grade six of primary school or is a primary school graduate.&#13;
2. Priority will be given to Kecamatan or less developed areas with low gross enrollment&#13;
rates at junior secondary education or low primary-secondary transition rates.&#13;
3. Priority will be given to students from low economic background (refer to a letter of&#13;
reference from head of the village where the student lives), to orphans and to females.&#13;
4. Preference will be given to students with good academic achievement scores validated&#13;
by the school principal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

to the head of MOEC district office (Kakandep) or to the head of MOEC provincial&#13;
office (Kakanwil).&#13;
2. The selection, reviewing, and awarding will be performed by the Scholarship Committee&#13;
at the Kanwil Office.&#13;
3. The scholarship recipient will receive a monthly stipend for twelve consecutive months,&#13;
starting from July until June of the following year. Funds will be made available through&#13;
the post office nearest to his/her school.&#13;
4. Stipend amount will be defined by MOEC and must be agreed upon by the Bank.&#13;
5. Scholarship funds will be disbursed by the Provincial Project's account and sent to the&#13;
head of Provincial Giro Office account, who will make them available to the recipients&#13;
through the Post Office.&#13;

back to the Provincial Project Manager.&#13;
7. The effectiveness of the above distribution system will be monitored quarterly by&#13;
auditing the receipt forms filled out by the scholarship recipients. In addition, the&#13;
Scholarship Committee at Kanwil Office will monitor the system in the field by&#13;
interviewing a representative sample of scholarship recipients every year.&#13;
8. The above criteria would be applied according to an agreed weighted scoring system&#13;
using data from agreed sources.&#13;

INDONESIA&#13;
Sumatra Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
TEACHER TRAINING AND SUPPORT&#13;
A.    Background&#13;
l.    Over the past twenty years the Indonesian government has provided two major kinds of&#13;
teacher education activities for its junior secondary school (SMP) teachers, pre-service education&#13;
and in-service education. In the 1 970s and 1 980s, when access to secondary education was&#13;
expanding very rapidly, there were chronic shortages of secondary school teachers. Thus, various&#13;
diploma programs were created to provide post-secondary pre-service teacher education&#13;
opportunities for new teachers. For many years the government operated a special one-year training&#13;
program (PGSMTP) for SMP teachers which provided D-1 certification; gradually preparation&#13;
shifted to IKIPs and FKIPs which offered two year D-ll programs. By the end of the 1980s, as&#13;
supply began to catch up with demand, all PGSMTP programs had been closed and D-11 programs&#13;
were being phased out. By the early 1990s, all secondary school teachers, SMA and SMP, were&#13;
expected to earn an SI university degree. At the same time, new elementary school teachers were&#13;
required to obtain D-II certification and practicing teachers assisted in upgrading to the D-ll level.&#13;
Under these conditions, it was considered necessary to provide D-III upgrading for SMP teachers.&#13;
This has been a large task since a majority of teachers still have D-1 or D-I1 qualifications. (The&#13;
proportion with below D-1I1 qualifications as of 1994/95 varied from 55% in West Sumatra to 95%&#13;
in Jambi.) D-III upgrading is now well underway in Science, Math, and English; it has recently&#13;
begun in Bahasa Indonesia; it has yet to begin in Social Studies.&#13;
2.    Also, as a consequence of the policy requiring 9 years of basic education (SD + SMP), more&#13;
SMPs are being opened in rural areas. Given the size of the catchment area in such areas, many of&#13;
these SMPs are quite small, having perhaps one or two classes per grade. In such circumstances it is&#13;
difficult to justify a full complement of teachers covering all subject areas. This means that many&#13;
teachers have to teach in more than one subject area. Under the recently launched, Bank-supported&#13;
Secondary School Teacher Education project many new SMP teachers will be prepared during pre-&#13;
service teacher education to teach more than one subject. For those who have already been pressed&#13;
into such service, special teacher certification programs are needed to help them become better&#13;
prepared to teach subjects in which they have not been trained.&#13;
3.    With respect to inservice of education, the country has succeeded over the past twenty years&#13;
in developing an extensive group of secondary school teachers into teacher trainers both at the&#13;
provincial and district levels. At the provincial level, instructors have been trained, many at the&#13;
advanced graduate level (MA) to plan school-based teacher education efforts (originally called&#13;
Pemantapan Kerja Guru or PGK, now usually referred to us Musyawara Guru Mata Pelajaran or&#13;
MGMP), to train the local tutors for those programs (Guru Inti), and to manage special PKG&#13;
programs (Model C) for teachers from remote area schools. Guru Inti (key teachers) have been&#13;
trained and commissioned to provide in-service activities at the district and sometimes school cluster&#13;
level. Whereas this program has provided invaluable human resources for school-based quality&#13;
improvement activities, in recent years the program has become routinized and therefore less&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6: Page 2 of 4                             81&#13;
effective than original pilot activities. Now evidence of improved pedagogy is hard to find outside&#13;
the most favored schools in large urban centers. It can be said that Indonesian junior secondary&#13;
educators deliver a body of planned curricular content, but pay insufficient attention to what and&#13;
how pupils are learning. Thus, in order to improve teachers' classroom effectiveness, changes in&#13;
school-based teacher development activities are suggested in three areas:  curriculum  content,&#13;
delivery mechanisms and training program management. The recommendations for the reform of&#13;
the in-service teacher training component of the project are based on findings of the JGF-sponsored&#13;
report, "Secondary Education in Indonesia:  Strengthening Teacher Competency and Student&#13;
Learning."&#13;
B.    Project Activities&#13;
4.    The teacher training component of the current project will consist of three kinds of activities&#13;
for SMP teachers: a) strengthening and supporting teacher D-111 teacher upgrading activities; b)&#13;
supporting second-subject teacher certification activities; and c) reforming and supporting the&#13;
delivery of school-based teacher development activities.&#13;
5.    D-III Upgrading. This project element will consist of three sequenced stages:&#13;
first, a careful evaluation of past upgrading activities, focusing on the relevance of the curriculum&#13;
and training to teacher knowledge-development needs and the impact of programs on teacher and&#13;
student classroom performance; second, redesign of the upgrading program, including curriculum,&#13;
delivery systems, and evaluation methods, based on the evaluation results, and third, the&#13;
implementation of the D-III upgrading for up to 3900 teachers in the project's five Sumatra&#13;
provinces in the field of IPS and Bahasa Indonesia.&#13;
6.    Second-Subject Teacher Certification. This project element will provide teachers with the&#13;
opportunity for second-subject certification. Certification activities, managed either by the Open&#13;
Learning University (for distance education) or local teacher training Institutes or Faculties (lecture&#13;
mode), will cover 18-20 credit hours and will last about one year (two semesters). The program&#13;
focuses on the subject matter contained in the SMP curriculum (revised 1994). Participants are&#13;
expected to study in fields related to that of their original certification: science majors can certify in&#13;
math and vice-versa; history in geography and vice-versa, and Indonesia majors in English and vice-&#13;
versa.&#13;
7.    Although there are many teachers in other fields who are underutilized in small SMPs (e.g.,&#13;
art, music, skills, health and PE), this project will only cover those teachers who are known to be&#13;
teaching in two or more of the above interrelated fields. This project will thus begin by the&#13;
Kabupaten's drawing up a list of all teachers who qualify, complete with the subject areas in which&#13;
candidates need second-subject certification. This will be submitted to Kanwil which will develop a&#13;
plan for this activity, using either local instructions or the Open Learning University system,&#13;
depending on local circumstances.&#13;
8.    School-Based Teacher Development Activities. This project element will consist of two&#13;
distinct types of activities:  first, reforming the content of existing teacher in-service training&#13;
programs, and second, providing support for the reformed delivery and management of such teacher&#13;
training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
82                       Annex 6: Page 3 of 4&#13;
Training program reform. The content of all in-servicing activities are expected to be&#13;
revitalized, and as a result, future programs will pay much more attention to promoting&#13;
student learning than they do at present. Emphasis will be given to the development of&#13;
effective presenting, explaining, questioning, and probing techniques, so that teachers&#13;
become skilled in identifying and addressing students' learning strategies and difficulties.&#13;
Teachers will learn to construct open-ended formative tests for use in the classroom, and to&#13;
use the results to improve learning. The reform activity will be spearheaded under the East&#13;
Java and NTT Junior Secondary Education Project and its results will be applied to this&#13;
project.&#13;
Training Program Delivery and Management. There will be two basic delivery mechanisms&#13;
in the project for on-going teacher in-service education. The first is for teachers who work in&#13;
remote area schools, those for which travel to the nearest neighbor school takes a day or&#13;
more. This mechanism is currently referred to as PKG, Model C. Teachers from these&#13;
schools will receive in-service education having the following features:&#13;
* participating teachers (those teaching the 6 core curricular subjects) will receive block in-&#13;
service education at the province level managed by instructors. There will be three blocks in&#13;
a year before the beginning of trimester three (one week). In-service blocks will emphasize&#13;
the development of teacher skills in promoting student learning as mentioned in the&#13;
"program reform" section above; this they will do through discussion of essential subject&#13;
matter concepts and student misconceptions, observation of mastery lessons, and live&#13;
teaching opportunities.&#13;
* receiving "on-service" visits from the instructor at least three times a year, after every in-&#13;
service block. During these on-service visits, teachers will be observed teaching a lesson in&#13;
which they try to incorporate ideas covered during their in-service blocks; receive feedback&#13;
and guidance from the instructor; observe a model lesson presented by the instructor, if one&#13;
is considered useful; and discuss teaching progress and problems with the instructors,&#13;
together the school who are not currently in the in-service cycle.)&#13;
9.     The second mechanism  of in-service education is that provided within the context of a&#13;
cluster of schools, a new variation of the system now being called Musyawara Guru Mata Pelajaran&#13;
(MGMP), designed especially for schools in cities and easily accessible rural areas. This mechanism&#13;
will be implemented at the district level and will operate through clusters of neighboring schools&#13;
(five to eight, including private schools and madrasah tsanawiyah). Teachers will gather at the&#13;
cluster center for in-service activities at least five times a trimester under the leadership of the guru&#13;
inti, following which teachers will each receive on-service visits from the guru inti. These activities&#13;
will be essentially independent and self-financing, but will be eligible for Project support under&#13;
certain conditions (criteria to be defined in the implementation plan). More detailed features of the&#13;
system and its management are as follows:&#13;
*Management. The program will be managed by Ka Kandep or his/her representative,&#13;
working with group head teachers, who themselves represent the heads of their cluster of&#13;
schools. The management team will divide the district into clusters of appropriate size, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 6.: Page 4 of 4                              83&#13;
will be responsible for finances (particularly yearly requests for Project funding), the&#13;
maintenance of records, and arranging the guru inti's work schedules.&#13;
*Guru inti. Several sets of guru inti have already been trained at the district level. Given the&#13;
organization of school clusters as the site for cluster-based training, several more sets of guru&#13;
inti will need to be trained under the project (an average of 160 per province; training to be&#13;
at PPPGs in Java during two consecutive years). Two inodels of guru inti deployment are&#13;
possible (preferences to be refined during implementation planning): a) several sets of guru&#13;
inti will be selected from district schools -- but not necessarily all clusters -- and deployed in&#13;
cluster training and visits according to a district level deployment plan; b) one set will be&#13;
selected and trained from each school cluster and deployed in that cluster. In either    case,&#13;
official arrangements will need to be made (SKs) to maintain the guru inti's teaching load at&#13;
their own school at a reduced level (an average of 12 hours per week).&#13;
*Meetings. Cluster level teachers meetings will be held on a regular basis, approximately 15&#13;
times per year.  A cluster level management team  consisting of the head teachers of&#13;
theparticipating schools will set the timetable, but the guri inti will be responsible for&#13;
organizing and running the all-day meetings.&#13;
*School visits. Guru inti will carry out systematic visits to all junior secondary schools in the&#13;
cluster, public and private (if they are receptive), on a regular basis. During the visits, the&#13;
guru inti will observe a lesson taught by every teacher in her/his specialty area, provide&#13;
feedback and write a report highlighting achievements as well as identifying areas where&#13;
there is need for improvement. A file of reports will be maintained.&#13;
*Visits for the Provincial Team. Subject specialist pengawas (supervisors) and instructors&#13;
will visit each district on a regular basis to guide and monitor the guru inti 's work. They will&#13;
review the guru inti's work. They will review the guru inti's school reports and visit cluster&#13;
meetings.&#13;
*Incentives for improvement will be introduced including the display of outstanding&#13;
students' work at the cluster center, the presentation of model lessons by outstanding&#13;
teachers at special cluster meetings, and opportunities for upgrading (to SI) and promotion&#13;
for guru inti.&#13;
*Funding. The project will provide funding for guru inti training, travel to and preparation&#13;
for cluster meetings, travel for school visits. It will also contribute a small amount (Rp&#13;
25,000 per cluster) for materials and supplies. Teacher travel expenses and consumables&#13;
(e.g. meals and snacks) should be covered by their own schools (swadana) unless the&#13;
school's discretionary funds (BP3) are so small and/or travel is so expensive that the school&#13;
cannot cover them. In this case, the school is eligible to apply for project support to cover its&#13;
teachers' participation in cluster activities (up to Rp 1 0,000 per teacher per cluster meeting).&#13;

Sumatra Junior Secondary Education Project&#13;
INFORMATION MANAGEMENT AND UTILIZATION COMPONENT&#13;
1.    Goals and Objectives of the Information Management and Utilization&#13;
Component&#13;
The overall goal of the IMUC is to have MOEC managers and staff making effective&#13;
management decisions and resource allocations based on timely, useful and accurate&#13;
information. To reach this goal, the IMUC proposes a strategy for improving information&#13;
management and utilization by MOEC managers and staff.&#13;
The basic approach is to make data available to user groups, provide them with tools&#13;
to analyze the data, train them to understand what the information means, and cultivate an&#13;
appreciation of information based decision making. This approach will focus on three&#13;
ingredients necessary for an effective JSEP-MIS: tools, skills and appreciation.&#13;
Each of the four information components have specific objectives:&#13;
FPM-Forecasting Planning and Monitoring: Kandep offices are able to produce&#13;
annual plans and monitor inputs, processes and outcomes throughout the year. This,&#13;
in turn, will lead to better planning, efficient allocation of resources and solution of&#13;
management problems.&#13;
SEMINS-Secondary Education Management Information System: Kandep,&#13;
Kanwil and PUSAT information staff are able to maintain data warehouses&#13;
(consisting of existing data sets) and use reporting tools to support decision making.&#13;
Similar to the FPM, managers will be able to analyze trends, identify problems and&#13;
follow up. Information and analytical tools are now placed closer to the providers&#13;
and immediate supervisors (i.e. Kandep offices and schools).&#13;
STOKK-School To Kandep and Kanwil information: School are better able to&#13;
manage and plan their resources, and Kandep offices provide direct support to&#13;
schools. Schools send quarterly data to Kandep offices (four indicators). Kandep&#13;
directly collect and process, and use the information produced for management&#13;
purposes (reduce dropouts, improve Ebtanes scores, reduce teacher classroom&#13;
absenteeism, etc.). Feedback reports are periodically sent to schools and followed&#13;
up.  As a result, the school management role of Kandep offices is significantly&#13;
increased, and they play a more active and supportive role.&#13;
Informatic Support: Hardware, software, skills and organization are available in&#13;
PUSAT, Kanwil and Kandep offices to support the management of information and&#13;
decision making. PUSAT and Kanwil offices will now have the tools, resources and&#13;
know-how to support their own managers, as well as Kandep offices and schools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7: Page 2 of 4                       85&#13;
2.    Methodology and Subcomponent Description&#13;
The FPM is a forecasting, planning and monitoring tool to used for managing and&#13;
planning the JSEP. The SEMINS provides new information tools and skills to better use&#13;
existing data for decision making. The STOKK component is design to assist Kandep and&#13;
Kanwil offices to better support schools through the periodic collection and analysis of&#13;
school data. The informatic support component provides the tools, skills and other inputs&#13;
required by the FPM, SEMINS and STOKK.&#13;
(a) FPM: Forecasting, Planning and Monitoring Tool. The objective is to provide&#13;
reliable information on educational resource needs, develop plans based on needs and&#13;
available resources, monitor and manage the implementation process, and annually re-&#13;
plan to reach targets and utilize resources efficiently and effectively. Computerized&#13;
applications and manual forms will be developed and used for forecasting, planning and&#13;
monitoring. Technical guides will also be developed, and staff trained. The FPM is&#13;
developed largely for the JSEP and will be used to improve the current MOEC planning&#13;
process by providing a comprehensive analysis of past results, and explicit projections of&#13;
future objectives and required inputs.&#13;
The FPM is an information tool for translating SMP needs and available resources into&#13;
Kandep/Kanwil plans, monitoring the execution of JSEP results and activities, and then&#13;
reviewing the results and annually.  A cyclical planning-management approach is&#13;
proposed that forecasts needs, develops a plan (activities, time and budget), monitors and&#13;
manages the implementation process, and reviews and re-plans annually.&#13;
(b) SEMINS: Secondary Education Management Information System for Improved&#13;
Management Decision Making. The objective of SEMINS is to improve management&#13;
decision making and resource allocation through 1) providing timely/reliable information&#13;
in accessible formats, 2) improving data management, utilization skills and appreciation,&#13;
and 3) providing requisite hardware/software and support systems to insure data&#13;
processing and information production. The problem facing the JSEP is there are too&#13;
much data but limited information, analysis and utilization.   The SEMINS  aims to&#13;
better use existing data sets to monitor key indicators, identify problem areas and&#13;
implement solutions. The strategy is to provide information management tools, skills,&#13;
improved internal and external data sets, and management appreciation for informed&#13;
decision making. Information processing and analysis tools will be provided, and staff&#13;
will be trained how to use the tools and the information produced. The SEMINS will use&#13;
database applications and GIS to produce information in tabular, graphic and map&#13;
formats.&#13;
The SEMINS approach is to provide data analysis tools to managers who have been&#13;
trained to collect/process key data, identify problems and achievements, and utilize the&#13;
value of information for routine management and planning. The SEMINS will begin&#13;
with the formulation of a team, a systematic audit of existing information, selection of&#13;
key indicators to be viewed over time and cross-sectionally, followed by the design or&#13;
application of computer tools such GIS or interactive query programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
86                     Annex 7: Page 3 of 4&#13;
(c) STOKK: Collection and Use of School Data in the Kecamaten, and Kandep and&#13;
Kanwil DIKMENUM Offices. The STOKK data management component will support&#13;
primarily Kandep and Kanwil offices by focusing on data from school and the direct&#13;
supervision and support by Kandep staff. Data from schools go directly to Kanwil and/or&#13;
PUSAT offices or are simply passed through Kandep offices with little processing,&#13;
analysis and feedback to schools. As a result, Kandep offices are often viewed as passive&#13;
conduits for data going to Kanwil and PUSAT offices.  Moreover, little feedback&#13;
information is received from higher level offices and virtually none is fed back to schools&#13;
(the basic information providers).  The STOKK approach proposes to address this&#13;
problem by providing information tools, skills and new roles to Kandep level staff.&#13;
The objective of the STOKK is to improve the direct management of schools by Kandep&#13;
offices (and the internal management of schools themselves) by providing Kandep&#13;
offices with the means to identify key problems areas and provide remedial action or&#13;
support.&#13;
The STOKK approach proposes to collect quarterly data from schools, compile the data&#13;
and analyze at the Kandep level, then feedback results to schools accompanied with&#13;
support and other remedial action. The content is very limited and focuses only on key&#13;
indicators: I ) quarterly Ebtanas scores. 2) teacher availability by subject area, 3)&#13;
coverage of classroom sessions by teachers, 4) number of students and dropouts, and 5)&#13;
availability of local school funds. The initial collection and scanning of Ebtanes sheets&#13;
would still be carried out in Kanwil offices (were OMRs)l but the results will be&#13;
immediately fed back to Kanwil offices and included on a Kanwil database showing&#13;
average scores for schools and trends. Items 2, 3, 4 and 5 will be collected on a small&#13;
form and transferred to Kandep offices directly. Kandep offices will be provided with&#13;
data management tools and skills to compile and use the information for routine&#13;
management and planning.&#13;
(d)    Informatics  Support  (hardware, softwvare, organization  and  skills).&#13;
Improvements in the information systems of' PUSAT, Kanwil and Kandep offices are&#13;
necessary to support the FPM, SEMINS and STOKK componenits. The following is a&#13;
description of the information improvement areas. These include 1) the development of&#13;
LANs in Kanwil offices that link data sets and users, 2) the maintenance of data bases in&#13;
PUSAT, Kanwil and Kandep level offices that allow access to key indicators by time, 3)&#13;
the provision of stand-alone computers to Kandep offices, 4) skill development and&#13;
guidelines, and 5) technical assistance to develop these systems. These improvements&#13;
will require the following informatic inputs: procurement and maintenance of hardware&#13;
(computers and peripheral equipment), software applications (off-the-self and custom&#13;
applications), and data sets (internal and external).&#13;
Related with the three core components is an effort to increase the appreciation of&#13;
managers regarding the utility and value of informationi. This will require improving the&#13;
accuracy and relevance of data for short and long-range decision making. Moreover&#13;
managers will require that information can be produced in formats that can be understand&#13;
and address salient questions. As a result, the plan for Informatic Support stresses the&#13;
need to develop informatic skills and organization at the PUSAT and Kanwil levels&#13;
Funding for the OMR readers to process Ebtanes scoresheets is not included in this budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 7. Page 4 of 4                         87&#13;
which can, in turn, support Kandep staff and school head masters utilize information&#13;
more effectively.&#13;
LAN: procurement, allocation and deployment of Kanwil LAN: Kanwil LAN&#13;
systems that network various bidang and support data processing and reporting tools&#13;
will permit the sharing of data and improve access. The objective is to support a&#13;
Kanwil data warehouse (with data from schools, Kandep offices, Kanwil bidang and&#13;
the PUSAT office) that can be accessed by any Kanwil level bidang. A central&#13;
Information Unit (IU) should be established (with client workstations) to maintain&#13;
the LAN while cables would link all of the key bidang offices. Several Kanwil&#13;
offices already have a LAN and trained support staff that could serve as a model, as&#13;
well as the central DIKMENUM office.&#13;
Client Server Database Systems. Data warehouses of existing data, plus FPM and&#13;
STOKK, will require client server hardware and software support at the PUSAT and&#13;
Kanwil levels. Only stand alone (un-networked) PC's will be used in Kanwil offices.&#13;
Client server database software will be installed on the PUSAT and Kanwil level&#13;
LAN systems. Desktop versions of the same (or reduced) databases will be installed&#13;
on Kanwil computers.&#13;
Desktop "Stand-alone" Systems. Stand-alone computer systems will only be&#13;
installed in Kandep offices that have met certain criteria and are certified. Section&#13;
3.4.3 describes the hardware, software, training and technical assistance&#13;
requirements. Since Kandep offices will not receive computers until established&#13;
criteria are met, installation will be phased in over the first 1-2 years of the JSEP,&#13;
thus allowing all Kandep offices time for meeting the criteria and training of staff.&#13;
By the third year of the project, all Kandep offices are expected to have trained staff&#13;
and 3 operational computers.&#13;
Technical Assistance for Designing and Developing the 3 subcomponents. In each&#13;
of the four main information system components, technical assistance will be&#13;
provided by technical advisors, MOEC teams, Information Unit (largely for training&#13;
and maintenance support) staff, and Local Computer Groups.&#13;

Composition. The Provincial Project Advisory Committee will be chaired by&#13;
KaKanwil and its membership will be comprised of related agencies and institutions dealing&#13;
with the education system.&#13;
Tasks. The advisory committee will give guidance to project implementors on the&#13;
merits of proposals submitted. The committee will review proposals from kabupaten and&#13;
kecamatan to make sure that annual work plans are in line with implementation criteria and&#13;
guidelines. This committee will work closely with the existing provincial Coordination Team&#13;
for Nine Years Basic Education (Tim Koordinasi Wajar). The advisory committee will meet at&#13;
least twice a year, or whenever major project decisions need to be made.&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
Central Program Coordination Unit&#13;
Objectives. The Central Program Coordination Unit (CPCU) will have three&#13;
objectives: (a) it will monitor overall progress, and ensure that project implementation (as it&#13;
unfolds through the Annual Work Plan and Budget process) is in accordance with project&#13;
objectives and agreed project criteria, rules and guidelines; (b) it will guide the provinces and&#13;
provide (or locate the sources of) the necessary technical assistance to ensure that the project&#13;
implements as planned; and (c) it will carry out central program activities that may affect more&#13;
than one project.&#13;
Composition Existing staff in Dikmenum, augmented as necessary by project-&#13;
financed consultants will be at the core of the management team.&#13;
Tasks, Roles and Responsibilities. The Director of Dikmenum will head the Central&#13;
Program Coordination Unit and coordinate the overall program of expanding junior secondary&#13;
education. An important function of the Central Program Coordination Unit will be to monitor&#13;
implementation achievements in the different provinces through progress reports and&#13;
monitoring indicators and to keep the Govemment and the Bank informed in this respect.&#13;
Dikmenum's role as the national level program coordination unit will be distinctly&#13;
different from the roles of the provincial (Kanwil) offices. As a program coordinator, its role&#13;
will be that of oversight and facilitation -- not implementation. Dikmenum will therefore: (a)&#13;
ensure that provincial implementation focuses on achieving their agreed project objectives as&#13;
measured through the agreed project-specific monitoring indicators; (b) assist the provinces in&#13;
establishing appropriate annual work plans and monitor that these are carried out in accordance&#13;
with agreed priorities, criteria and procedures; (c) help ensure timely preparation of regional&#13;
project budgets (DIP); (d) assist in establishing appropriate management information systems&#13;
(both financial and substantive) for use at the Kanwil level as well as at the National level; (e)&#13;
disseminate infornation to the provinces in order to highlight promising regional approaches in&#13;
the design of Annual Work Plans and Budgets; and (f) identify or provide technical assistance&#13;
to the provinces to ensure compliance with agreed project-specific criteria, rules and&#13;
regulations.&#13;

Linkages to the Provincial Teams. Dikmenum will also help design and implement&#13;
national and provincial capacity building plans as the project unfolds. This will include&#13;
assisting the provinces establish appropriate project information systems and procedures on the&#13;
principle that relevant information from one system will feed into the next system, and that&#13;
there will be meaningful back and forth flow of information across administrative levels.&#13;
Supervisory Functions. Dikmenum will have a procurement supervisory function to&#13;
help ensure that the project is implemented in accordance with the stipulations of the Loan&#13;
Agreement and the Bank's Procurement Guidelines. The CPCU will appoint procurement&#13;
specialists to provide training and technical assistance to PPIUs in the preparation of&#13;
procurement documents and to review documents from the provinces to ensure that they are in&#13;
line with project procurement guidelines.&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
Provincial Project Implementation Unit&#13;
Objectives. In order to get the project effectively implemented, the projects will be&#13;
executed through existing line authorities at the Kanwil level. There will be no expansion of&#13;
staff positions: existing positions will be used, and/or converted temporarily for project use as&#13;
and when necessary. Similarly, there will be no structural changes in the administrative&#13;
system.&#13;
Team, Organization and Responsibilities. Project-specific task forces, commensurate&#13;
with the focus and specificity of each of the provincial projects will be established as&#13;
necessary. Each of these task forces will be composed of existing staff at the Kanwil-level, and&#13;
-- where appropriate -- at the Kandep level. These task forces will grow and contract as&#13;
necessary during project implementation.&#13;
KaKanwil in each Province will be responsible for project implementation. To lend a&#13;
focal point to the proposed implementation arrangements, a Provincial Project Implementation&#13;
Unit (PPIU) under the overall leadership of KaKanwil, will be established in each Province.&#13;
This PPIU, managed by the head of the secondary education group (Kabid-Dikmenum) or a&#13;
Dikmenum staff member working under his/her supervision, will form the core of the proposed&#13;
implementation arrangement. The manager of the PPIU will be responsible for the day-to-day&#13;
management of the project and will report to KaKanwil on all matters pertaining to the project.&#13;
He/she will also keep the project authorities in Jakarta (Dikmenum) informed about progress,&#13;
including any events that threatened progress, such as the lack of human or financial resources&#13;
to resolve emerging problems. If necessary, one full-time monitoring officer and one or two&#13;
support staff will assist the manager of the PPIU in keeping track of implementation progress.&#13;
The PPIU will be assisted by a technical resource group in each province for the&#13;
duration of the project. The duties of this group, including that of consultants, will be to assist&#13;
in technical analysis of sector issues, prepare annual plans and detailed project designs,&#13;
troubleshoot on an ad-hoc basis, and conduct staff training/guidance. The technical resource&#13;
group will have access to other staff resources (including those from IKIPs/Universities) with&#13;
specialized project-related skills.&#13;

PROJECT MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    This Annex describes how project progress will be monitored and impact will be&#13;
evaluated. Reporting on monitoring and evaluation results will be done within the context of&#13;
Bank progress reporting. Project progress reporting will be on a semi-annual cycle. The&#13;
half-yearly progress report will cover the project status (physical progress. financial and&#13;
performance status) and will include status of the perforimanice indicators. The program&#13;
report will be prepared in advance of the half-yearly Batik supervisioni missions. Details of&#13;
progress reporting are described here.&#13;
Project Monitoring Indicators&#13;
2.     Project status will be monitored through performiance and output indicators (see&#13;
Annex 13). Project progress and performance will be monitored on the basis of several types&#13;
of indicators:&#13;
(a)    Progress Monitoring Agaitist the Implementation Plan&#13;
Annex 12 (Implementation Plan) gives hinformationi on the milestones, dates&#13;
and tasks to be carried out during the implementation process. At each&#13;
supervision mission, these will be reviewed, their status assessed, and the&#13;
Plan updated to reflect progress. The updated version of the lmplementation&#13;
Plan would indicate actual versus planned  ilmplementation and slhow&#13;
adjustments made accordingly.&#13;
(b)    Ouantitative Indicators&#13;
In each progress report and at each supervision, the indicators as listed in&#13;
Annex 10 will be reviewed. The actual against planned data will be filled out&#13;
by the PlUs, and will be discussed during supervision.&#13;
(c)    Qualitative Indicators&#13;
At each supervision mission, an evaluation will be undertaken by the&#13;
supervision team of progress regarding qualitative indicators. The PlUs will&#13;
mention, in the progress report, the status of these indicators, which will then&#13;
form the basis for the supervision discussion. For each indicators, specific&#13;
evidence of progress should be provided.&#13;
&#13;

expense and by component and status of civil works (number of&#13;
contracts, location, type of school covered and cost for each contract);&#13;
* Training activities (SAR plan and current status): number and type of&#13;
training courses, number of participants, duration of each course, cost of&#13;
each course;&#13;
*  Status of Technical Assistance contracts (foreign and local): number of&#13;
person/months planned and currently used, costs of contracts and status&#13;
of disbursement.&#13;
(f)    A report from the auditing consultants (whenever available).&#13;
Additional Reports and Reviews&#13;
4.    A few special reviews will also be carried out during project implementation, to&#13;
further support monitoring of progress. These reviews will be carried out by independent&#13;
external consultants and will be managed by the Project Coordination Unit in Dikmenum.&#13;
(a)    Survey, in preparation for mid-term, to evaluated progress in improving&#13;
management skills and processes in Kanwils and Kandeps;&#13;
(b)    Annually, a review of expenditures of government funds by private schools;&#13;

Supervision Schedule&#13;
5.    Supervision missions will be held twice a year, during the project implementation&#13;
period. A planned mission schedule is listed in Annex 11. The mid-term review mission will&#13;
consist of a more thorough review; this mission will review overall progress since the&#13;
beginning of the implementation period, and will evaluate the need for adjustments or&#13;

            Indonesia - Sumatra Junior Secondary
            Education Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Sumatra Junior Secondary Education
            Project will assist the Ministry of Education and Culture
            (MOEC) in achieving a greater number of junior secondary
            school graduates of better quality upon graduation. This
            will be pursued by: 1) expanding access to junior secondary
            education in a cost-effective and equitable way; 2)
            improving the quality of junior secondary education; and 3)
            strengthening the education management capacity at all
            levels. To meet these objectives, the following components
            and subcomponents will be implemented selectively and in
            varying degrees in the public and private systems of the
            five project provinces: DI Aceh, West Sumatra, Jambi, South
            Sumatra, and Lampung. The first objective will involve: 1)
            creation of a total of 53,520 student school places; 2)
            gradual expansion of alternative equivalency programs; 3)
            student and teacher accommodations for public schools in
            rural and remote areas; and 4) financing of scholarships for
            32,600 talented poor students with priority given to girls.
            The second objective will require: 1) strengthening of
            teachers' subject-matter knowledge and pedagogical
            skills; 2) enhancement of learning environment; and 3)
            provision of contract teachers for rural areas. The third
            objective will be achieved by: 1) training school principals
            and other administrators in managing schools and providing
            pedagogical support to teachers; and 2) developing
            managerial and data analysis capacity.
