AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROGRAM&#13;
SUPPORT PROJECT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. PROJECT BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1    Madagascar is a country with considerable unfulfilled growth potential.  With low&#13;
population density, and available supply of labor, it has good soils and climate and an environment&#13;
and ecosystem  potentially attractive to tourism.  However, poor economic policies since&#13;
independence in 1960, coupled with population growth of about 2.8 percent per annum have&#13;
resulted in the persistence of low, and recently declining, per capita income (US$240 in 1993),&#13;
making Madagascar one of the world's poorest nations.&#13;
1.2    Madagascar does not figure among the top performners in Africa in terms of annual&#13;
agricultural growth (which averaged 2.8 percent between 1986-91). Although the recent history of&#13;
economic development in Madagascar has been mixed, the country does possess today some of&#13;
those characteristics which allow for a certain optimism in terms of longer term successful&#13;
agricultural sector performance. The macro-policy environment for the agricultural sector has&#13;
begun to improve, there are few price distortions, the marketing of agricultural production is no&#13;
longer regulated, and there is a relative openness to private sector investment in agricultural&#13;
marketing and processing and liberal support for farmners' groups and associations. With these&#13;
factors in place in Madagascar, the agricultural economy has begun to grow after a period of&#13;
decline.&#13;
1.3    Over past years, attempts to redress the weaknesses of poor government services in the&#13;
agricultural sector by extemal donors have resulted in the creation of a plethora of projects (more&#13;
than seventy in the 1994 PIP), exacerbating problems of coordination and sustainability. In the late&#13;
1980s, the Government successfully tested the introduction of pilot extension and research&#13;
management and field level training systems, to reduce the reliance on, and the wastefulness of, a&#13;
multiplicity of autonomous operations. The Bank supported this initiative through the National&#13;
Agricultural Research program (Cr. 2042-MAG) and the National Extension Pilot project&#13;
(Cr. 2150-MAG).&#13;
B. ECONOMIC BACKGROUND&#13;
General&#13;
1.4    Madagascar is the world's fourth largest island, 1,500 km long, with an area of 590,000&#13;
km2 (slightly larger than France). It is characterized by a rough topography, variations in soils and&#13;
climate, some mineral endowment and unique flora and fauna. Rice is the country's main staple&#13;
and the major exports are coffee, vanilla, cloves and shellfish. The population in 1995 is estimated&#13;
at about 13.0 million inhabitants, growing at a rate of 2.8 percent per year; its distribution is very&#13;
uneven, with an average of 18.5 per kM2, but exceeding 100 per km2 in the central highlands.&#13;
Close to one-half of the urban population of 3 million lives in the capital, Antananarivo. Poor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2                  MADAGASCAR: Agricultural Extension Program Support Project&#13;
economic performance characterized the 1970s and early 1980s and stemmed largely from&#13;
inappropriate economic policies, with emphasis on public investment financed from external&#13;
borrowing - mostly for economically non-viable projects, with nationalization of foreign-owned&#13;
enterprises, extensive consumer subsidies and pervasive controls over private economic activity.&#13;
The predominantly agricultural economy, which had grown modestly in the late 1980s, following a&#13;
decade of decline, has been disrupted by political developments since 1991. Output fell by almost 6&#13;
percent in 1991, recovering to a growth of only 1 and 2 percent respectively in 1992 and 1993.&#13;
Annual inflation which remained at about 13 percent over the same period increased significantly&#13;
in late 1994 to almost 50 percent.&#13;
Structural Adjustment Policies and Results&#13;
1.5    The govermment's reform program has been supported since 1985 by four IDA sector&#13;
adjustment credits covering industry, agriculture, trade, and the public sector. A number of&#13;
important reforms were undertaken with the support of these credits. In industry, the government&#13;
eliminated most price controls and export taxes, reduced controls on profit margins, and began to&#13;
dismantle the heavy administrative regulations, which were a disincentive to private activity. In&#13;
agriculture, it liberalized the pricing and domestic marketing of rice, eliminated most state&#13;
monopolies, and abolished export taxes, except for vanilla. In the external sector, the government&#13;
substantially eased administrative export restrictions, greatly enhanced the country's international&#13;
competitiveness through a series of devaluations of the Malagasy franc (FMG), ended quantitative&#13;
import restrictions, introduced an automatic allocation of foreign exchange for merchandise&#13;
imports through an open general licensing (OGL) system, and initiated major tariff reform to&#13;
reduce effective protection. An improved budgetary system and process for public investment&#13;
programming was introduiced. Steps were taken to withdraw the state from productive activities,&#13;
and to close down a number of long-standing projects which absorbed an inordinate amount of&#13;
domestic financing. Financial institutions were partially privatized, and the sector was opened to&#13;
privately-owned banks.&#13;
1.6    During the period of political change between 1991 and 1993, while the country was&#13;
achieving a successful transition to multi-party democracy, Madagascar's economy encountered&#13;
difficulties. Budgetary discipline deteriorated, monetary management was lax, external arrears&#13;
accumulated and GDP grew at less than the population growth rate, underscoring the need for&#13;
reform. It was only in April 1994 that the Government committed itself to resume the economic&#13;
reform process and took some initial steps. A floating exchange rate was introduced, import&#13;
restrictions were lifted and a new value-added tax was introduced to replace a regressive indirect&#13;
tax introduced in late 1993. Time was lost however in firming up negotiations with the IMF, when&#13;
some officials pursued ill-advised parallel financing deals, portrayed as an alternative to agreement&#13;
with the Bretton Woods Institutions. It was not until early 1995 that the government finally&#13;
reached a new agreement with the IMF on a program to bring down the rate of inflation. Up-front&#13;
measures under this program have been implemented including sharp price increases in energy&#13;
products and increases in excise taxes. The Government has also revised the 1995 budget and PIP&#13;
to make them consistent with the agreed strategy. These moves have helped to restore the&#13;
Government's credibility and prepare the ground for further IMF and Bank support and possible&#13;
debt relief from the Paris Club.&#13;

Chapter J. Background                                                                    3&#13;
C. THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR&#13;
Agriculture in the Economy&#13;
1.7    Agriculture is the most important contributor to the national economy (33 percent of&#13;
GDP). The sector employs over 80 percent of the active population and, with agro-industries,&#13;
accounts for 60 percent of export earnings. The sector supplies the primary inputs to the food and&#13;
textile industries which together account for 75 percent of the value added of the industrial sector.&#13;
1.8    Although most tropical and temperate climate crops can be found in Madagascar, only&#13;
about 2.3 million ha, i.e. about 6 percent of the country's arable land, are cultivated. Rice&#13;
production is the most important agricultural activity, accounting for 41 percent of agricultural&#13;
output (1992).  Fishing is the second most important activity (20 percent of agricultural&#13;
production). The traditional export crops (coffee, vanilla, cloves and pepper) together account for&#13;
7 percent of agricultural output. Root crops and maize contribute 11 percent. Vegetables and&#13;
fruits contribute 10 percent, industrial crops 3 percent and livestock 5 percent. During recent&#13;
years, there has been a shift in the relative importance of export products. The share of traditional&#13;
exports has declined to about 40 percent in 1991, while the share of non-traditional products, such&#13;
as shrimps and lobsters, which now account for about 15 percent of total exports, has been rapidly&#13;
growing by over 20 percent per year since 1986.&#13;
Recent Agricultural Developments&#13;
1.9    The response from the agricultural sector to the adjustment measures of the 1980s has&#13;
been mixed. Fisheries and non-traditional exports, which benefited from early trade liberalization&#13;
and adjustment measures, expanded significantly after 1983 (industrial fisheries more than doubled&#13;
over the next decade); similarly, non-rice agricultural activities (dairy products, potatoes, sweet&#13;
potatoes, maize, barley, wheat) in the central highlands - wvhere communications are more&#13;
favorable (proximity to large urban markets, adequacy of physical infrastructure and agricultural&#13;
services) - responded positively to improved price incentives. On the contrary, the traditional&#13;
exports (coffee, vanilla, cloves, pepper) and the cotton sub-sector and their corresponding regions&#13;
(East Coast, Northern region, South West Coast) did not respond to the adjustment measures,&#13;
partly because of the drop in world market prices (coffee, cloves) and partly due to the continued&#13;
deterioration of communications and the absence of full trade liberalization (vanilla).  The&#13;
production of rice, after first responding to the market liberalization measures in 1986, has&#13;
stagnated because of ineffective agricultural advisory services, dilapidated irrigation infrastructure,&#13;
poor market infrastructure, and the lack of price incentives. encouraged by the artificially high&#13;
value of the FMG (until 1994), favoring cheap imports.&#13;
Potential for Agricultural Growth&#13;
1.10   Madagascar possesses a considerable potential for agricultural growth. It has a&#13;
comparative advantage in agricultural production based on low labor costs and availability of land&#13;
in different ecological zones. It can produce a variety of temperate and tropical crops for the&#13;
domestic and export markets.  It possesses an extensive irrigation infrastructure requiring&#13;
rehabilitation, but largely underutilized and representing an important asset to enable&#13;
intensification and diversification. Moreover, crop yields are uniformly low and the potential to&#13;
increase yields on the basis of known technologies is high.&#13;
&#13;

4                  MADAGASCAR: Agricultural Extension Program Support Project&#13;
Constraints to Agricultural Development&#13;
1.11   Sustained growth of the sector has been constrained by macroeconomic policy and poor&#13;
agricultural services (research and extension) to encourage the transfer of technology, the lack of&#13;
reliable transport and communication infrastructure linking farmers with a market, poor control&#13;
and lack of management of water resources and inadequate protection of watershed areas. Public&#13;
investment m the agricultural sector has concentrated too heavily over recent years on undertaking&#13;
activities which could be carried out by farmers themselves and too little on providing basic&#13;
services and creating an environment which would enable farmers to fend better for themselves.&#13;
The Government has invited donors to contribute to finding a solution to these constraints, and the&#13;
Bank's current lending portfolio includes support to five major programs (Research, Extension,&#13;
Livestock, Environment, Irrigation Rehabilitation), a pilot rural credit scheme and an agricultural&#13;
export promotion project, which is yet to be negotiated. The Government is also developing, with&#13;
Bank support, approaches to rural infrastructure, focusing on feeder roads and market&#13;
infrastructure improvements, working through local decentralized organizations.&#13;
Government Strategy for Rural Development&#13;
1.12   Government recognizes that a rural development policy based on the intensification of the&#13;
small farm sector in the high potential areas of Madagascar would accelerate the development of&#13;
the entire rural non-farm economy, increase the size of the domestic market and provide sizable&#13;
farm and off-farm employment opportunities, thus reducing poverty. The driving force for&#13;
agricultural growth and development would be the increased integration of the agricultural sector&#13;
into the market economy. Government's rural development policy aims to achieve the following&#13;
objectives: (a) reduce poverty and improve the conditions of life in the rural areas; (b) improve&#13;
agricultural productivity: (c) optimize the use of available resources; and (d) protect the&#13;
environment.&#13;
1.13   To achieve the objective of increasing integration of the agricultural sector into the market&#13;
economy, the Ministry of Rural Development published a policy statement in February 1994,&#13;
which targets (i) the creation of an environment (economic, technical, institutional and&#13;
infrastructural) to favor economic activity in the rural areas and to optimize the conditions for&#13;
savings, investment and production within the framework of economic liberalization; (ii) the&#13;
redefinition of the role of the state in activities of promotion, support, coordination, monitoring and&#13;
control, leaving production activities and marketing to farmers, farmers' organizations and the&#13;
private sector; and (iii) the encouragement of producers to associate to undertake projects of&#13;
common interest and to improve their collective bargaining power. A key element of Government's&#13;
rural development strategy recognizes that the establishment and effective operation of a&#13;
professional agricultural extension service can contribute to increasing incomes for a large number&#13;
of rural farmers, thus making a significant contribution to national output and growth.&#13;
National Agricultural Extension Strategy&#13;
1.14   The objectives of the national agricultural extension program are to increase agricultural&#13;
productivity and farmers' incomes in an environmentally sustainable manner and to rationalize the&#13;
use of public resources in support of agricultural services.&#13;
1.15   The principles guiding the implementation of a national agricultural extension progran are&#13;
based on the successful experience of the National Extension Pilot Project (paras. 2.1 - 2.7). They&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2. THE PILOT AGRICULTURAL EXTENSION PROJECT&#13;
2.1    Objectives. The pilot project (Credit 2150-MAG) was to test a sustainable extension&#13;
strategy in five pilot extension districts, which, if successful, could be replicated in the remainder&#13;
of the country. Its objective was to define a cost-effective approach to improving the quality of the&#13;
field services for the effective transfer of agricultural technology to farmers throughout&#13;
Madagascar.&#13;
2.2   Implementation. During the 4-year pilot phase, started in 1990, an improved extension&#13;
management system linked with tested principles of extension was introduced in six extension&#13;
districts, of the country's 28 districts, with a farming population of 260,000. The project started&#13;
slowly due to internal constraints (lack of local funding, delayed  procurement, poor staff&#13;
selection), exogenous constraints (political upheaval and a civil service strike) and insufficient&#13;
farmer and management oriented supervision. Major improvements in project performance were&#13;
achieved in 1993 following the nomination of key staff to positions of responsibility at the central&#13;
and provincial levels and the effective application of the management principles upon which the&#13;
project had been originally launched. Regular links between researchers and extension agents at&#13;
monthly technological review meetings were confirmed through agreements drawn up between&#13;
national and regional research and extension institutions. Training and field level diagnosis of&#13;
farmers' real needs were intensified and the number of field level demonstration plots was&#13;
increased from 3,120 in 1992 to 13,750 in 1994.&#13;
2.3    Lessons from the Pilot Project. The proposed project is based on the experience and&#13;
lessons of the pilot extension. Less than satisfactory results in the first two years of the pilot&#13;
project were due (i) a poor national coordination team and (ii) lack of commitment to implement&#13;
the detailed stages of an extension management approach, which although relatively new in&#13;
Madagascar, had produced impressive results elsewhere.  Once the new management team,&#13;
appointed in 1992, had defined and applied the principles of the management system in place&#13;
today, results and feedback from farmers and field staff increased significantly. Poor coordination&#13;
with ongoing projects and other extension activities in the pilot areas led to a misunderstanding of&#13;
the program's objectives. This has been redressed in the launch of new districts under the&#13;
proposed project.&#13;
2.4    The pilot project demonstrated that good results can be obtained at a low cost by a large&#13;
number of farmers from existing agricultural staff, using systematic work programming, regular&#13;
training, and diagnosis of results between farmers and field staff. As an example, rice yields on&#13;
some 1,700 demonstration plots in farmers' fields, with good water control, increased by an&#13;
average of almost 100 percent compared with control plots using traditional techniques. On more&#13;
than 1,350 separate demonstration plots where the technical improvement was early transplanting&#13;
(without improved water management), yields were on average 53 per cent higher than on control&#13;
plots. (For fuller details see Table 4.1). In both cases, these results were achieved without any&#13;
cash investment, using techniques adopted directly by the farmers. The gross margins generated by&#13;
application of these techniques represent approximately US$300 and US$125 per hectare&#13;
respectively. Extension staff work with contact groups, with an average of 11 farmers per group&#13;
and three demonstration plots per group. About 15 percent of all farmers in the pilot areas have&#13;
adopted a new technique within the past three years. The incremental production in rice alone for&#13;

Chapter 1: Background                                                               5&#13;
include: (a) a single line of command, through the field level officer (AVB) who can respond to&#13;
farmners' felt extension needs. Each agent has a clear line of responsibility to a single chief The&#13;
main objective of each person working within the system is to provide technical support and&#13;
training to the AVB; (b) extension staff efforts concentrated on the sole objective of advising the&#13;
farners on how to improve their techniques and revenue, free of other functions, which should be&#13;
delegated to qualified staff specifically recruited to handle them; (c) regular training. Two levels&#13;
of training are critical - the fortnightly training for the AVB and the monthly technological review&#13;
(AMRT), associating research staff, subject matter specialists and farmers; (d) close links&#13;
between extension and research to renew technical advice; (e) monitoring and evaluation of&#13;
extension to ensure that the extension system is operating as designed; and (f) the preparation of a&#13;
work program as the key to ensuring regular farmer presence during extension visits and as an aid&#13;
to supervision and training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.  THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT RATIONALE&#13;
3.1    Government strategy recognizes that growth and income increases are possible for a large&#13;
number of farmers in Madagascar, if supported by professional agricultural services. Government&#13;
also recognizes that the multiplicity of efforts in support of agricultural extension, under numerous&#13;
projects supported by different public and non-governmental agencies throughout Madagascar has&#13;
achieved few sustainable results over past years and does not make the best use of scarce resources&#13;
provided in the public investment program. By introducing a national system, to which different&#13;
donors can contribute over time, the Government intends to reduce the number of separate efforts&#13;
being made to bring technical advice to farmers. In a letter addressed to all donors in February&#13;
1995, Government has confirmed its policy to follow a national program approach and invited&#13;
donors to contribute accordingly (Annex 111).  The proposed Agricultural Extension Program&#13;
support project provides funding for the next four years to ensure that the program is launched&#13;
nationwide.&#13;
3.2    One of the basic principles of the national program acknowledges that the provision of&#13;
agricultural extension information is by nature a public good. Delivery of this good may be carried&#13;
out by private, NGO or public services. Payment for extension services is expected to be&#13;
principally from public funds, whatever agency is responsible for extension. The project will&#13;
support extension currently being provided by private and semi-public institutions, (such as the&#13;
national cotton company) and will encourage (and fund) pilot initiatives providing agricultural&#13;
advice to farmers, on the condition that such initiatives are cost-effective. A number of agreements&#13;
have already been drawn up between the DNVA and private/parapublic partners. The current&#13;
environment in Madagascar and the value of individual output of the majority of Madagascar's&#13;
farmers does not permit a wholly market driven provision of extension services at this stage.&#13;
3.3    Project Design and the Recent Operations Evaluation Department (OED) Study on&#13;
Agricultural Extension. A recent OED study of agricultural extension experience by the Bank&#13;
underlined the following major considerations for successful extension projects: (i) careful&#13;
definition of institutions and farmers in the design of extension strategy; (ii) past support for&#13;
extension and government commitment; (iii) a system which acknowledges the specific&#13;
requirements of farmers; (iv) full involvement of clients in planning and program implementation;&#13;
(v) a technology stock and capacity to generate new relevant technologies; (vi) the capacities of&#13;
agencies and staff to deliver different services and the potential for private agencies to provide&#13;
services; (vii) the importance given to gender issues; (viii) the potential of mass media for&#13;
complementing other forms of extension; (ix) the importance of needs-based staff training&#13;
programs; (x) accountability of the service providers to the clients and a system to monitor its&#13;
effectiveness. The proposed project responds positively on nine of the ten foregoing points.&#13;
Malagasy extension strategy is based on a close evaluation of experience over the last thirty years&#13;
and a process of consultation between farmers, researchers, extension staff and NGOs in the&#13;
expansion of the current pilot effort. Government commitment has been reiterated in a recent&#13;
public policy statement, addressed to external donors, while 41 percent of the Ministry of Rural&#13;
Development's 1995 budget is currently devoted to projects with a vocation for agricultural&#13;
extension. The extension system is based on a process of diagnosis of farmer needs, jointly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 2: The Pilot Agricultural Extension Project                                    7&#13;
1994 was about 15,000 tons or the equivalent of US$1.9 million from about ten percent of all local&#13;
rice producers.&#13;
2.5    The pilot project has demonstrated that the application of a structured and systematic&#13;
approach to agricultural extension, using existing resources and applying low-cost and simple&#13;
techniques, readily accessible to national technicians, can have a rapid and significant impact on&#13;
farmer incomes and productivity and contribute to reducing rural poverty. The system can be&#13;
managed independently from the central coordination unit in the rural extension districts, provided&#13;
there is a sufficient budget and a regular flow of funds. The role of the central coordination unit&#13;
becomes one of ensuring regular supervision, monitoring and evaluation, providing material&#13;
support and training for launching new areas and centralizing budget and financial accounting.&#13;
The experience of the 6 initial pilot areas can be replicated on a national scale - to all 28 extension&#13;
districts - with appropriate programming.&#13;
2.6    The pilot project has also demonstrated the efficacy of certain other principles to be&#13;
respected in order to achieve contact with a maximum number of farmers. These include (a)&#13;
regular and progranumed contact with farmers, through regular visits with contact groups (rather&#13;
than individual farmers) according to a fixed itinerary and timetable, joint diagnosis of problems&#13;
encountered and the use of demonstration plots for farmers to prove to themselves the effectiveness&#13;
(or ineffectiveness) of recommendations: (b) a clear organization chart with manageable ratios of&#13;
supervisory and training staff and farmers per extension agent; (c) extension advice which can be&#13;
readily adopted by farmers, without supplementary investments, to ensure rapid impact; and (d)&#13;
regular supervision to observe technical results, to assess work organization, to evaluate the&#13;
relationship between farmers and field staff and, above all, to design future technical messages on&#13;
the basis of farmers' needs.&#13;
2.7    The pilot project has also shown that, in order to carry out the above, a certain minimum&#13;
material support is necessary for the different levels of staff within the system, including means of&#13;
transport, operating costs of such transport, equipment and materials for extension and training and&#13;
subsistence allowances for staff who are required to spend a high proportion of their time away&#13;
from their base.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 3: The Project                                                             9&#13;
undertaken by subject matter specialists, farmers and extension agents. Very close involvement of&#13;
clients has been ensured during project preparation and 30 percent of project preparation time has&#13;
been spent in the field. Over 80 simple technical messages were introduced during the past year&#13;
under the pilot program. T'he extension system envisages the association of non-governmental&#13;
agencies in the shared delivery of services and will select the best of available staff. Almost fifty&#13;
percent of the central staff of the national service are women, as an indicator of the importance&#13;
given to gender issues. Investments in on-the-job and long termn training figure prominently in&#13;
project design. Both internal and external monitoring of the extension delivery system are&#13;
envisaged. Although use has been made of mass media during the pilot phase, no major investment&#13;
is currently envisaged for complementary support to such activities. The demand on management&#13;
to ensure training, research linkages, support to farmer organizations, logistical support and&#13;
monitoring and evaluation is such for the next four years that the Ministry of Rural Development&#13;
considers it too early to invest in a major mass media effort. During the course of the project, such&#13;
proposals will be prepared for the next stage of the program.&#13;
B. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.4    The objectives of the national agricultural extension program are to increase agricultural&#13;
productivity and farmers' incomes in an environmentally sustainable manner and to rationalize the&#13;
use of public resources in support of agricultural services. The proposed program is central to the&#13;
Government's strategy to (a) reduce poverty and improve the conditions of life in the rural areas,&#13;
(b) improve agricultural productivity; (c) optimize the use of available resources; and (d) protect&#13;
the environment by generalizing the delivery of professional agricultura'. services to all levels of the&#13;
fanming community. The project will fund actions to ensure the realization of these objectives.&#13;
C. STATUS OF PROJECT PREPARATION&#13;
3.5    Government and Bank staff provided a commitment to rapid preparation and processing of&#13;
a national extension program in June 1994, while ensuring that beneficiaries and stakeholders were&#13;
closely associated in the process. For its part Government circulated for comment its national&#13;
extension policy proposal in June 1994, undertook an evaluation of the pilot extension experience&#13;
and moved immediately to launch three new extension districts. The Bank fielded three missions in&#13;
October 1994, January and March 1995 and appointed a new extension specialist to the resident&#13;
mission to provide full support on the ground. A three-monthly progress review workshop, bringing&#13;
together the majority of key staff from the pilot areas, in Antananarivo in October 1994 provided a&#13;
visiting Bank mission with the opportunity to appreciate the strengths and weaknesses of the&#13;
implementation of the national agricultural extension program to date. A launch workshop to&#13;
introduce the principles of the national program to the extension districts of Toliary, Diego Suarez&#13;
and Mahajanga and systematic visits to discuss extension needs with farmers followed in October&#13;
1994, January and April 1995 respectively. Representatives of all local institutions, both public&#13;
and private, involved in rural development were invited to exchange views on how agricultural&#13;
extension could be improved in their area.  Representatives of the Ministry responsible for&#13;
Agriculture met with Bank officials in March 1995 in Washington to review and contribute to an&#13;
early draft of this report. All these actions favor brisk project start-up. Launch workshops and&#13;
consultation with farmers will continue during 1996, 1997 and 1998 in an attempt to define the&#13;
nature of the extension structtire to be adopted for each new region. Since program planning is an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10                  MADA GASCAR: Agricultural Extension Program Support Project&#13;
integral part of these workshops, detailed project preparation will continue during project&#13;
implementation. Intensive supervision by the Bank during implementation will be assured by the&#13;
full-time extension specialist based in Antananarivo and regular supervision from Headquarters&#13;
staff of the Bank.&#13;
3.6    Close coordination with staff involved with ongoing IDA projects supporting manpower&#13;
training (Cr. 2382-MAG), Agricultural Research (Cr. 2042-MAG), Livestock Sector Development&#13;
(Cr. 2243-MAG), Irrigation Rehabilitation (Cr. 2644-MAG) and Environment (Cr. 2125-MAG)&#13;
has been ensured throughout the project preparation cycle. Activities of all five projects are closely&#13;
linked and will contribute to the implementation of the proposed project. Where the Food Security&#13;
and Nutrition project (Cr. 2474-MAG) provides support for agricultural production activities in&#13;
the new extension districts, coordination will be ensured with this project too.&#13;
D. SUMMARY OF PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
3.7    The project would build on the experience of the pilot agricultural extension project&#13;
(funded under Cr. 2150-MAG). It would fund the first four-year phase of a long-term (15-20&#13;
years) national agricultural extension program to upgrade agricultural services countrywide. The&#13;
project would also strengthen the training capacity and key management systems in the Ministry of&#13;
Rural Development and Land Reforrn. The main project components are:&#13;
(a)    Strengthening the delivery of the agricultural extension services and&#13;
providing support for farmers' organizations through the provision of&#13;
transport, equipment, rehabilitation of facilities and incremental operating&#13;
costs;&#13;
(b)   Improving the technical and management capacity of agricultural staff&#13;
through training by the provision of equipment, supplies, facilities and&#13;
transport for regular in-service training of extension staff and the&#13;
rehabilitation of at least two agricultural training colleges;&#13;
(c)    Support for financial management, accounting  and  auditing,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation and regular supervision at all levels of the&#13;
national agricultural extension system.&#13;
E. DETAILED FEATURES&#13;
3.8    Agricultural extension, research linkages and support for farmer organizations&#13;
(estimated cost US$30.5 million, including contingencies). The national agricultural extension&#13;
program will be introduced to the country's 28 extension districts over a four-year period. Details&#13;
are shown in Annex IV and in the attached Map I (IBRD Number 28673). In addition to the six&#13;
pilot extension districts, three new districts will become operational in 1995. A further seven&#13;
districts will be operational in 1996 and 1997 respectively, with the remaining five districts to be&#13;
launched in 1998. Criteria for selection of the districts include (i) the desire to achieve national&#13;
coverage (at least one district in each of the 6 regions) in the early years; (ii) consistency with the&#13;
evolution of the national agricultural research program, to ensure good extensionlresearch&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 3: The Project                                                              11&#13;
linkages; and (iii) recognition of the closing dates of ongoing extension projects, to ensure a smooth&#13;
transition, when current external funding ceases.&#13;
3.9    As defined in the document "Le Systeme National de Vulgarisation Agricole a&#13;
Madagascar" dated February 1995, the main agricultural extension delivery mechanism would be&#13;
regular visits by field level extension staff (AVB) to contact groups of farmers under a system of&#13;
extension management involving a fixed schedule of visits to farmers, regular training of extension&#13;
staff and clearly defined training and supervision responsibilities. Extension recommendations will&#13;
be developed for crop, animal husbandry production and natural resource management practices&#13;
through a process of diagnosis of farmer needs involving researchers, subject matter specialists,&#13;
extension staff and farmers themselves.&#13;
3.10   Extension management would be decentralized, enabling the regional extension units to&#13;
function largely independently in diagnosing local farmer problems and in defining appropriate&#13;
extension recommendations. The capacity of staff to deal with specific sociological aspects such&#13;
as the selection of contact farmers/contact groups and intensifying contact with women farmers&#13;
will be improved through training and short-term consultancy support.&#13;
3.11   Almost 3,000 field level extension staff will be involved by the fourth year of the project&#13;
with the objective of making extension services available to the country's approximately 1.5&#13;
million farm families. Extension agents will be expected to cover between 400 and 600 farm&#13;
families each, depending upon local population density and constraints imposed by poor rural&#13;
infrastructure and communications. Current ratios are lower than this, in the absence of field staff&#13;
transportation means. Training and redeployment will be required to ensure more cost-effective&#13;
use of existing resources. Approximately 1,200 staff are already employed as field extension&#13;
workers under the Directorate of Agriculture. At least as many more are employed by individual&#13;
projects or other Directorates of the MEADR, such as Livestock, Protection des Vegetaux or Eaux&#13;
et Forets, either as field extension or as technical support staff. Field staff working for parastatal&#13;
organizations, or for NGOs in the rural areas would also provide the complement of staff to&#13;
provide full national coverage. It is not expected that there will be a net increase in the numbers of&#13;
extension staff, although a net improvement in the quality of such staff can be expected. Formal&#13;
agreements would be drawn up between providers of extension services (NGOs, private sector,&#13;
parastatals) and the DNVA. defining the terms and conditions for the provision of extension&#13;
services, where the former are prepared to substitute for direct state-provided services.&#13;
3.12    The process of integrating ongoing donor-funded activities under the national extension&#13;
program umbrella has already begun. During the workshops held to launch the national program&#13;
in each new extension district, the representatives of ongoing projects and donors have participated&#13;
to review the relevance of the national program to their ongoing activities. Several ongoing donor-&#13;
funded projects, especially those targeted at specific commodities (maize, groundnuts, oilseeds)&#13;
view the national program as an opportunity to broaden the dissemination of technical messages to&#13;
a wider audience. Because of this advantage and the cost/effective approach, these projects have&#13;
already reoriented their activities and agreed to assume extension responsibility for a given&#13;
geographical area in the new districts. Over time, as agreements for the funding of separate&#13;
projects come up for renewal, it is expected that independent project structures, with separate&#13;
management and financial services, will be integrated into the national program management&#13;
structure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12                   MADAGASCAR: Agricultural Extension Program Support Project&#13;
3.13   To enable the extension system to function effectively, the project would fund vehicles,&#13;
equipment and incremental operating costs during an initial four year period. Offices of the&#13;
regional and district extension services would be rehabilitated using simple techniques and local&#13;
building firms. Most field staff would be provided with motor bicycles. Headquarters and regional&#13;
staff would be provided with four-wheel drive vehicles.&#13;
3.14   Launch workshops would be held in each new extension district to evaluate the strengths&#13;
and weaknesses of the existing extension services being offered to farmers from different sources.&#13;
The launch workshops, which have already been undertaken successfully in three districts, would&#13;
associate institutions, projects, NGOs and private operators with an interest in agricultural&#13;
extension, training and research and support to farmers' associations. These workshops would&#13;
provide an opportunity for the different participants to exchange their experiences and prepare&#13;
together the content and the program for setting up a more effective field advisory service to&#13;
farmers, based on the principles defined under the national program. A detailed action program&#13;
would be drawn up as an output of these workshops. Training of all staff would follow. Services&#13;
to be subcontracted to non-government agencies would be governed by a specific agreement&#13;
identifying the roles of each party and the resources to be funded by the Directorate of Agriculture.&#13;
3.15   If extension staff are to concentrate their activities on field advisory work, there is a need&#13;
to ensure the provision of other farmer support functions, which have traditionally also been the&#13;
responsibility of the extension agents. These include assistance in marketing, access to credit, seeds&#13;
improvement and multiplication, and organizing to ensure commercial input deliveries. Drawing&#13;
on the experience of the Conseiller Animateur under the Irrigation Rehabilitation project, farmer&#13;
organization specialists (SOPs), working at the same level in the organizational structure of the&#13;
DNVA as subject matter specialists (TS) will provide practical advice to farners in organizing and&#13;
managing groups and associations. They will provide a liaison between farmers groups and&#13;
commercial marketing and supply outlets, with credit institutions, and with seed producers, plant&#13;
and improved livestock breeders. They will support the work and activities of groups or&#13;
associations such as Water Users' Associations (WUAs), marketing associations and seed&#13;
multiplication groups. Recent experience with the spontaneous creation of farmers' groups has&#13;
been encouraging throughout Madagascar. WUAs on irrigation schemes now number almost one&#13;
hundred against zero eight years ago. Groups and associations are being established in areas&#13;
where credit and marketing structures have improved. Both crop and livestock producers are&#13;
increasingly seeing the advantages of voluntary association.&#13;
3.16   While the national extension program aims to rationalize public expenditure on farmer&#13;
advisory services and coordinate closely with agricultural research, it makes no pretcnsion to unify&#13;
all Government services in the rural areas. Services such as quarantine, livestock health, quality&#13;
control, agricultural statistics collection, information diffusion and control of hazardous products&#13;
will remain under the responsibility of separate directorates. Continuing support for such services&#13;
is important.&#13;
3.17   Training and Human Resource Management (estimated cost US$3.3 million including&#13;
contingencies). Training is critical to improving the capacity of extension staff and farmers to&#13;
adopt new technology. Many field staff have received no formal technical education after leaving&#13;
school and very little service training has taken place over the past 15 to 20 vears. The project will&#13;
support the technical training of extension agents, staff of the national agricultural extension&#13;
system, researchers and farmers. During project appraisal, a training program has been prepared,&#13;
identifying staff and training courses to be organized during the next four years (annex in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 3: The Project                                                              13&#13;
Implementation Volume refers). A total of almost 3,000 extension agents will be i place at the&#13;
end of 4 years (see Annex MV). Fortnightly on-the-job training of these staff will be undertaken by&#13;
subject matter specialists, who will in tum receive regular training from research and other&#13;
specialist staff. Monthly technology review meetings (AMRT) will bring together extension staff,&#13;
researchers and farmers to review the relevance of technical messages which have been introduced.&#13;
3.18   Following initial launch workshops (par. 3.14), training of key staff in the elements of the&#13;
extension management system will be provided by trainers from the national coordination team.&#13;
Initial training has already been provided to key staff of the first three new extension districts.&#13;
Similar training by up to three teams of trainers is programmed for key staff between March and&#13;
October each year, for 7 districts in 1996 and 1997 and 5 new districts in 1998. Staff who receive&#13;
initial training (about 40-50 per district) will then share that training with the remainder of staff&#13;
from their district, thus ensuring that all staff are aware of the new system within a relatively short&#13;
period of time (2-3 months) (for details of programming see Annex IV) . Specific training is also&#13;
programmed (i) for farmer organization specialists; (ii) in field diagnosis; (iii) in monitoring and&#13;
evaluation and surveys; (iv) for training of trainers; (v) in human resource management; (vi) in&#13;
supervisory techniques; (vii) in internal audit; (viii) in computer use; (ix) in management; (x) in&#13;
techniques for carrying out tests in farmers' fields; and (xi) in documentation. Provision has also&#13;
been made for overseas study tours.&#13;
3.19   In the longer term, sustainable agricultural production will require more sophisticated&#13;
techniques to achieve higher levels of productivity, to maintain soil fertility and to adapt to&#13;
changing market conditions. Currently few agricultural field staff have more than a basic training&#13;
in agriculture. In order to prepare for the longer term need for more qualified staff, provision has&#13;
been made for the rehabilitation of the Agricultural Colleges at Bezaha and Ambanja, which have&#13;
been virtually inoperative for the past three years, to provide skills upgrading training for field staff&#13;
and also initial training fox staff who will be joining agricultural services in years to come. The&#13;
rehabilitation of these two colleges, which includes repairs to buildings, reequipping and&#13;
refurbishing, will be considered a pilot experience and work on rehabilitating the remaining four&#13;
colleges, during the final two years of the project, will only start on condition that the first two&#13;
colleges are completed and operating effectively.&#13;
3.20   The Human Resources Management Directorate (DGRH) of the Ministry of Rural&#13;
Development responsible for agriculture will be closely associated with the implementation of the&#13;
national program and will provide support and advice on staffing and training decisions to the&#13;
national extension services director. Provision is made for computers to strengthen the capacity for&#13;
handling data on personnel of the Ministry responsible for agriculture both at the regional and&#13;
central levels.&#13;
3.21   Financial Management, Accounting and Internal Audit (estimated cost US$0.2 million&#13;
including contingencies).   The project will make a significant contribution to increasing the&#13;
degree of financial autonomy in the decentralized regions and extension districts of the Ministry&#13;
responsible for agriculture. A system of financial management will be introduced which will&#13;
respond to modern management information requirements, improving upon the regulatory&#13;
framework set by the Malagasy public accounting laws. Existing budgeting and accounting&#13;
procedures will be improved in two ways: setting up budget preparation, monitoring and evaluation&#13;
systems that meet the project's operational and management information requirements, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

introducing double entry and accrual-based accounting as recommended under IASC's guidelines&#13;
applicable to public accounting. The system's architecture will be based on the concept of&#13;
integrated financial management, capturing accounting data at source and once only. Appropriate&#13;
PC based computer software will be used to support the system. The system's functional process is&#13;
presented in a separate annex of the Implementation Volume.&#13;
3.22   Monitoring and Evaluation (estimated cost US$0.5 million including contingencies).&#13;
The project will support monitoring and evaluation of the impact of the extension program in each&#13;
district and will ensure regular feed-back to regional staff and to central coordination staff. Details&#13;
of program monitoring indicators are included at Annex V. Although more diverse data are being&#13;
and will continue to be collected by the M &amp; E teams, the monitoring of the effectiveness of the&#13;
project will be based upon its impact on rice production. Since rice is grown in all regions of&#13;
Madagascar, this is an appropriate criterion for monitoring purposes and will help simplify data&#13;
collection requirements.&#13;
3.23   Supervision by the National Agricultural Extension Service Directorate (estimated&#13;
cost US$2.2 million including contingencies). The project will fund transportation and office&#13;
equipment to facilitate supervision and internal auditing functions by the central extension,&#13;
training, financial management, farner organization and support services. Office rehabilitation&#13;
both in Antananarivo and at the provincial and district headquarters will be funded under this&#13;
componet, as'Il be the sub-contracting of extension activities to be carried out by third parties.&#13;

F. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
3.24   Project Cost. The project would be implemented over four years. Total project costs,&#13;
including price and physical contingencies, are estimnated at FMG 211,668 million (US$36.6&#13;
million) of which 34 percent is estimated as foreign exchange costs and 13 percent taxes. Base&#13;
costs are estimated at US$34.4 million equivalent and contingencies amount to US$2.2 million&#13;
equivalent ( 6 percent of total costs). Project costs by conmponent are summarized in Table 3.1&#13;
below and detailed cost tables by year and by component are provided in Annex I. Unit costs are&#13;
based on early 1995 prices and/or the most recent actual costs incurred under the pilot project.&#13;

3.25   Financing.    No cofinancing of the project had been negotiated at the time of appraisal.&#13;
However, funds from ongoing projects in support of agricultural extension may be available in&#13;
specific areas as the program expands. The Government has invited external donors to make&#13;
proposals on howv they might support future stages of expansion of the national program and plans&#13;
to ensure the necessary coordination to bring about the integration of different individual efforts&#13;
into the national program. During project preparation and appraisal, emphasis was placed on the&#13;
responsibility of Government in donor coordination. Discussions have started with donors on&#13;
possible forms of support for the program once on-going donor-funded extension research and&#13;
training projects have come to a close.&#13;
3.26   The proposed IDA Credit of US$25.2 million equivalent would finance 100 percent of&#13;
foreign expcnditures and 75 percent of local costs for equipment, vehicles and civil works and&#13;
would also finance 100 percent of training and consulting services, excluding duties and taxes.&#13;
The Credit would fund 100 percent of foreign expenditures and 95 percent of the local costs of&#13;
field allowances and incremental operating expenses, excluding salaries. The Government would&#13;
meet the salaries and social costs of all personnel employed in the extension program, whether civil&#13;
servants or contractual staff. Agreements drawn up with agencies subcontracting extension and&#13;
research tasks would specify the proportion of staffing costs to be borne by the Government. The&#13;
project would finance part of the rehabilitation] costs of the agricultural colleges at Ambanja and&#13;
Bezaha (the ongoing Manpower Training project (Cr. 2382-MAG) will finance the balance&#13;
needed). The operating costs of these two colleges would be fully met by the Government. The&#13;
resulting share between IDA and the Government of Madagascar would be 79 percent and 21&#13;
percent, respectively, net of taxes and duties. The financing plan, which includes taxes and duties,&#13;
is presented in Table 3.2.&#13;

3.27   The main project elements, their estimated costs and methods of procurement are&#13;
summanized in Table 3.3. The proposed timetable for the procurement of major goods and services&#13;
is included in Annex VHIl. During and following project appraisal, the main procurement&#13;
documents for the procurement of goods in Year 1 of the project were finalized, to ensure efficient&#13;
project start-up.&#13;

3.28   Civil Works. Contracts estimated to cost US$200,000 or more should be carried out&#13;
under International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. Bidding documents for such contracts&#13;
will be sent to the IDA for prior review and non-objection. The main item of civil works will be&#13;
the rehabilitation of the two agricultural colleges at Ambanja and Bezaha. At an estimnated cost of&#13;
US$574,000 and US$497,000 respectively, the renovation of buildings and annexes for each&#13;
college will be subject to ICB procedures, in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for Procurement&#13;
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995). Other rehabilitation work of regional and&#13;
district agricultural extension offices is not expected to exceed US$40,000 per building and will be&#13;
carried out using National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures.  Civil works contracts&#13;
procured using NCB procedures would not exceed US$ 1.7 million in aggregate.&#13;
3.29   Goods financed under the project include vehicles and spare parts, office furmiture,&#13;
outfitting and extension materials, demonstration equipment and teaching tools. Most of these&#13;
goods would be grouped into packages costing more than US$100,000 equivalent and procured&#13;
through ICB procedures, in accordance with IDA's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD&#13;
Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995). Bidding documents for such contracts will be sent to&#13;
IDA for prior review and non-objection. Contracts for goods procured under ICB would total&#13;
US$15.1 million, of which a significant proportion (82%) would be for motorcycles and vehicles.&#13;
Where ICB procedures are used, a preferential margin of 15 percent, or the applicable customs&#13;
duty, whichever is the lower, over the c.i.f prices of competing goods would be given to domestic&#13;
manufacturers in accordance with IDA guidelines. Contracts for furniture and other small items&#13;
below US$100,000 each, totaling US$500,000, required over a period of time and available locally&#13;
at competitive prices, for which foreign firms would not be interested, would be procured by NCB.&#13;
Goods contracts each estimated at US$30,000 or less and not exceeding US$200,000 in aggregate&#13;
would be procured by National Shopping. Procurement would be spread over the four years of the&#13;
project. Details are included in a separate annex in the Implementation Volume to this report.&#13;
3.30   Consultancies and Training. The details of the training program have been summarized&#13;
in the Implementation Volume. As part of the annual work program, MEADR would submit for&#13;

IDA review and approval annual training and study tour programs for each of the courses. From&#13;
the second year the program would include an evaluation of the previous year's training program.&#13;
Contracts for short term consultants (including auditors and external trainers) to be hired under the&#13;
project would be awarded following Bank guidelines with terms of reference, qualifications and&#13;
conditions of service satisfactory to IDA. No external long term consultants are envisaged.&#13;
Contracts for consultants/training expected to cost more than US$ 100,000 for consultant firms and&#13;
US$50,000 for individuals should be sent to IDA for prior review and nonobjection.&#13;
3.31   Procurement information will be collected and recorded as follows:&#13;
(a) prompt reporting of contract award information by the Borrower;&#13;
(b) comprehensive quarterly reports to IDA by the Borrower indicating:&#13;
(i)  updated cost estimates for individual contracts and for the total project,&#13;
including best estimates of allowances for physical and price contingencies:&#13;
(ii) revisecl timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract&#13;
award and completion time for individual contracts; and&#13;
(iii) compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.&#13;
H. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.32   The IDA Credit is expected to be effective by October 1995 and the project will run over&#13;
the following four years. Prior to effectiveness, in order to maintain the momentum started under&#13;
the Pilot Extension project (Cr. 2150-MAG), which closes end June 1995, eligible operating costs&#13;
of the project incurred between July 1, 1995 and the date of credit effectiveness will be prefinanced&#13;
from the local budget and reinsured out of the credit up to an amount not exceeding the equivalent&#13;
of US$500,000. Once the proposed credit is effective, these expenses will be reimbursed by the&#13;
credit.&#13;
3.33   Once agreement has been reached on the annual work program and budgets, withdrawals&#13;
from the Credit will be claimed using the standard procedures, including reimbursement of&#13;
expenses prefinanced by the Ministry responsible for agriculture against presentation of a&#13;
withdrawal request, direct payment to suppliers or replenishment of the special account. To&#13;
facilitate disbursement locally, IDA will advance the sum of US$300,000 into a special account&#13;
with a commercial bank acceptable to IDA in convertible currency to be opened by the PNVA.&#13;
Upon effectiveness US$200,000 will be deposited to the special account. The remaining balance&#13;
of US$100,000 will be paid as needed. Expenditures should be grouped for replenishment of this&#13;
special account and submitted for reimbursement every month or more frequently, if necessary,&#13;
through the standard channel of the Ministry of Finance. The account may be used to pay for&#13;
expenditures in either local currency or foreign exchange through the commercial banking system,&#13;
against any category of eligible expenditure. All expenditures less than 20 percent of the initial&#13;
deposit would be paid from the special account. All replenishments should be fully documented&#13;
except in cases where Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) are authorized. Monthly bank statements&#13;
and reconciliation of the Special Account statement would accompany replenishment requests.&#13;
3.34   A project advance account in local currency, operated by the Deputy Director of&#13;
Agriculture, would be established in a commercial bank with an initial deposit equivalent to&#13;
US$100,000 to cover Government's contribution to project expenditures during start-up. This&#13;
advance account would be replenished from a deposit account opened either at the Treasury or the&#13;
Central Bank, which would be created to receive the totality of the Government's counterpart&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18                  MADAGASCAR: Agricultural Extension Program Support Project&#13;
contribution each year. The advance account would be replenished by Government, against&#13;
presentation of supporting documentation, every two months or whenever the balance falls to one&#13;
third of the original amount, whichever comes first. The deposit of an initial amount equivalent&#13;
to US$100,000 shall be a condition of effectiveness of the credit (para 5.2).&#13;
3.35   Disbursement by IDA against Statements of Expenditure (SOEs).   Appropriate&#13;
arrangements for accounting and auditing are in place and the MEADR possesses the ability to&#13;
process and maintain SOE documentation in a manner satisfactory to IDA.  The project&#13;
coordination unit would claim reimbursement on the basis of SOEs for: (i) civil works costing&#13;
less than US$200,000 equivalent; (ii) goods and equipment contracts less than US$100,000. (iii)&#13;
contracts with consulting firms valued at less than US$100,000; (iv) contracts with individual&#13;
consultants costing less than US$50,000 (including amendments); and (v) all operating costs and&#13;
training.&#13;
3.36   The project will retain all the relevant supporting documentation for reimbursement claims&#13;
under SOEs for inspection by supervision missions. During the course of the annual audit of the&#13;
project's accounts, the auditor will certify that all expenditures claimed under SOEs during the&#13;
year have been properly incurred for the project.&#13;

3.37   The Credit closing date is fixed as December 31, 2000, which provides five years for the&#13;
disbursement of expenditures under this four year project. The disbursement categories for the&#13;
Credit are presented in Table 3.4. IDA will finance 100 percent of all categories of foreign costs,&#13;
expenditures, excluding identifiable taxes and duties, 75 percent of local costs of vehicles,&#13;
equipment and civil works, 95 percent of local operating costs and 100 percent of costs of&#13;
consultants, subcontracts, audit and training, excluding identifiable taxes and duties, up to the&#13;
amount agreed in the annual work program. The annual work program will be subject to approval&#13;
by IDA. The expected disbursement profile is given in the Table 3.5 below. Disbursements are&#13;
expected to proceed more briskly than the standard disbursement profile for the agricultural sector&#13;
in Madagascar since a large proportion of expenditure will be disbursed against a few major&#13;
contracts or incremental recurrent expenditure. Thirty months after project effectiveness, if the&#13;
experience of the first phase is conclusive, preparation will begin on a second phase to provide&#13;
continued support to the program.&#13;

I. AccouNTs, AUDITING AND REPORTING PROCEDURES&#13;
3.38   Accounting.  The project's key functional processes, budgeting, purchasing, paying,&#13;
recording and reporting have been designed to operate in line with the Government of&#13;
Madagascar's decision to decentralize day-to-day management of operations to the regional level,&#13;
and were applied for Credit 2150-MAG, for which audit reports have been satisfactory. Further&#13;
simplification of accounting systems is to be introduced with the support of financial management&#13;
consultants.  The improvements should be in place by September 1995.  Financial and&#13;
administrative functions will thus be represented at three levels, central, provincial and district,&#13;
with the lowest management unit being the agricultural extension district (circonscription&#13;
agricole). A fully detailed annex in the Implementation Volume, together with the organization&#13;
chart for the Finance and Administrative department, reflects this process. Functional relations&#13;
between the national extension director's finance department and the regional management centers&#13;
will be established through financial rules and procedures. Their application will be monitored with&#13;
the support of the newly created Internal Audit (IA) unit staffed initially with four experienced&#13;
accountants. Each regional management unit will be visited by them and reports will be sent to the&#13;
Deputy Director of Agriculture on a monthly basis. The IA staff will combine control functions&#13;
with on-the-job training functions. They will themselves be trained as trainers at the outset and&#13;
benefit subsequently from technical advice on a regular basis from subject matter specialists&#13;
recruited from the private sector. The IA unit will thus function on principles similar to those of the&#13;
national extension system Terms of reference for the IA unit are included in the Implementation&#13;
Volume.&#13;
3.39   Audit of the project accounts will be facilitated by the IA's year round verification of&#13;
internal controls, and by the application of IASC guidelines on accounting. The project's accounts&#13;
will be audited by private audit firms recruited under ICB procedures, having demonstrated&#13;
professional training and applying auditing standards recognized under LASC's auditing guidelines.&#13;
Financial reporting standards will be in conformity with recent Bank's guidelines on financial&#13;
statements and norms of the IASC. Financial statements submitted for auditing will comprise as a&#13;
minimum, a statement of net position (balance sheet equivalent), source and application of funds, a&#13;
summary budget execution statement, a summary statement on the IDA Special Account and&#13;
withdrawals claimed on the basis of SOEs. Audit reports will be submitted within six months of&#13;
the end of the fiscal year to which they refer. Assurances to this effect were obtained at&#13;
negotiations (para 5.1 (i)).&#13;
3.40   A draft annual work program, a budget and financing plan incorporating the annual&#13;
training program, details of procurement and other agreed project details would be prepared and&#13;
submitted to IDA for comments and approval by the end of September of the preceding year.&#13;
Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations (para 5.1 (ii))&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

3.41   Reports on project implementation progress would be submitted to IDA semi-annually at&#13;
the end of March and at the end of September each year. The September report would be&#13;
submitted to coincide with discussion of the draft annual work program for the following year.&#13;
Assurances to this effect were obtained during negotiations (para 5.1 (ii))&#13;
J. PROJECT IMPACT ON GOVERNMENT BUDGET&#13;
3.42   Overall Program Costs and Financial Sustainability. The counterpart contribution from&#13;
the Government to the project is the equivalent of US$2.8 million per annum, mainly comprising&#13;
salaries and social security costs of the staff of the national extension system. The 1995 budget for&#13;
salaries of the Directorate for Agriculture was US$1.8 million equivalent. Since the majority of&#13;
staff for the extension system will come from the existing establishment of the Directorate of&#13;
Agriculture, there will be no incremental salary costs in the Directorate's recurrent budget. In&#13;
1994, the Directorate of Agriculture was responsible for the management of fourteen projects&#13;
under its investment budget (PIP), either directly concerned with agricultural extension or with&#13;
agricultural extension components. The total cost of these projects as reflected in the 1994 PIP&#13;
was US$12.9 million of which Government's counterpart contribution for project activities was&#13;
US$2.3 million equivalent. As these projects close down, counterpart funds will be released to&#13;
meet the national program's funding needs. Expenditure on agricultural extension under other&#13;
directorates represents a further call on counterpart funding. A large proportion of the activities&#13;
undertaken by these projects will be integrated under the national agricultural extension program&#13;
over the next four years. At full development, the annual cost of extension would be US$7.5&#13;
million per annum, of which US$3.85 in recurrent costs (salaries, field allowances, maintenance&#13;
and operating expenses). This represents about 8 percent of total public expenditure for the&#13;
agricultural sector in 1994. The program would not represent an incremental charge to public&#13;
funding (aggregate national and external funding), but it would result in some savings. In view of&#13;
current budgetary difficulties, in the interests of simplicity and given the lead time necessary for&#13;
ongoing projects to terminate or be integrated into the national system, IDA will fund a fixed&#13;
proportion of recurrent costs over the first four years of the program. Thereafter, Government will&#13;
assume an increasing proportion of such costs.&#13;
3.43   Unit costs of extension services per farm family provided by ongoing projects vary from&#13;
twice to eighty times that of the pilot agricultural extension project, according to a recent study.&#13;
Use of the guideline figure of limiting extension service costs to around US$5 per farm family will&#13;
facilitate the budget review process and provide a benchmark for establishing how well the project&#13;
is meeting cost-effectiveness criteria.&#13;
3.44   In support of the rationalization of ongoing extension projects as part of the national&#13;
extension program, the Government shall, no later than October 31 each year carry out, an&#13;
annual review of the Public Expenditure Program for the agricultural sector (para 5.1 iii)).&#13;

4. PROJECT ORGANIZATION AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. PROJECT ORGANIZATION&#13;
4.1    The national agricultural extension program  will support the existing organizational&#13;
structure of the Ministry of Rural Development and be managed by the Deputy Director of&#13;
Agriculture, who is responsible to the national Director for Agriculture. He will be supported by&#13;
three central services (Extension and Research Linkages, Training and Human Resource&#13;
Management and Support for Farmer Organizations), one division responsible for Administration,&#13;
Logistic Support and Finance and two operational units (Internal Audit and Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation). Details arc presented in Annex II. The responsibilities of the national director for&#13;
extension includc decision-making on: (a) technical matters; (b) financial matters; and (c) jointly&#13;
with the Director for Agriculture, the nomination and posting of staff working within the national&#13;
agricultural extension system. He will be the main interlocutor for all partners involved with&#13;
research or extension under the program. He is responsible for the preparation of the annual work&#13;
program, for progress reports, for the bidding process of the main contracts under the program and&#13;
for the coordination of the program's accounts.&#13;
4.2    At the regional level, the head of the extension district (chef de circonscription) will be&#13;
responsible for the dailv implementation of the program, under the auspices of the head of the&#13;
provincial extension service, who in turn is responsible directly to the Deputy Director of&#13;
Agriculture. The head of the extension district will be supported by one or more assistants,&#13;
depending upon the number of extension supervisors under his control.&#13;
4.3    Expansion of the extension system to new districts will be based on careful organization&#13;
and programming by the central training team and on close liaison between the national research&#13;
center (FOFIFA) and the Extension and Research Linkages Division.  The capacity and&#13;
effectiveness of these teams at work were witnessed and confirmed by the Bank appraisal team&#13;
during the October 1994, .lanuary and April 1995 launch workshops.&#13;
4.4    To ensure efficient mobility and maintenance of equipment provided, motorcycles will be&#13;
provided provisionally to field staff as their personal property. Full personal title will be confirmed&#13;
at the end of four years. when the motorbikes will be replaced. The terms under which these&#13;
motorcycles will be provided to staff and the details of how they will be maintained were&#13;
agreed during negotiations. The details of how such equipment will be provided to third partv&#13;
institutions such as NGOs, private agencies or parastatal companies will be included in agreements&#13;
to be negotiated on a case by case basis with such institutions.&#13;
4.5    The Madagascar Agricultural Extension Program is already very much aware of the&#13;
important role of women in the effective achievement of results. Already half of the key posts in&#13;
the central services are filled by women (24 women), and female members of the staff of regional&#13;
teams have already played an active role in efforts to launch new districts. Specific extension&#13;
themes concerned with the needs of women will be identified by women themselves, in the process&#13;
of diagnosis of farmer needs.&#13;

B. EXTENSION/RESEARCH LINKAGE AND SUPPORT FOR FARMERS' ORGANIZATIONS&#13;
4.6    On the basis of a diagnosis carried out jointly by the farmers, the extension and the&#13;
research staff, priority listing of technical recommendations will be renewed each season. The&#13;
monthly technology review workshops (AMRT) will be held in each extension district and will&#13;
facilitate leaming and exchange of experiences between subject matter specialists, researchers and&#13;
farmers. Trials undertaken in farmers' fields will provide validation of research results under local&#13;
conditions and will provide an opportunity to identify rapidly the problems limiting the application&#13;
of recommendations for problems earlier identified. Demonstration plots will be used to compare&#13;
new methods proposed by extension staff with farmers' existing practices as control plots.&#13;
4.7    Farmer Organization Specialists (SOPs) would participate in monthly training organized&#13;
by the regional heads of service for support to farmer organizations, at which representatives of&#13;
private sector suppliers, credit institutions and NGOs would be invited. In particular, SOPs will&#13;
help farmers identify: (i) the justification for their working together, such as undertaking a&#13;
common project, bulk purchasing, collective transportation or sales; (ii) how to mobilize savings or&#13;
capital for an investment project; (iii) how to obtain credit. (iv) how to prepare the necessary&#13;
documentation to ensure sound operation as a group; (v) how to prepare a work program to ensure&#13;
the optimum benefits from those services which exist to support them; (vi) how to give specific&#13;
attention to the needs of women or young members of their community; and (vii) how to negotiate&#13;
purchase or sales contracts.&#13;
4.8   Improvements in agricultural practices among farmers in the pilot areas have demonstrated&#13;
the potential for improving yields in a variety of crops and production techniques. Table 4.1 shows&#13;
a summary of a selection from some of the eighty different technical messages which have been&#13;
outreached in the pilot area and the upper and lower limits of the impact they had on farmers'&#13;
yields in 1993/4. The significant differences between yields on control plots using the farmers'&#13;
traditional practices and yields by farmers who have adopted the technique underline the potential.&#13;
Similar results are anticipated as the program develops nationwide.&#13;

C. TRAINING AND HUMAN RESOURCES MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.9    The details of the training courses to be carried out under the project are presented in the&#13;
Implementation Volume The basis for the success of the agricultural extension program is the&#13;
fortnightlv training provided to the agricultural extension staff  This training will have an&#13;
immediate impact on the level of technical competence of the field level staff. In the longer term,&#13;
the more promising of these staff will receive training in the agricultural colleges, which will also&#13;
ensure basic agricultural training for new staff who will join the technical services in years to&#13;
come. Rehabilitation of the first two of six existing agricultural colleges at Bezaha, in the Tulear&#13;
province and at Ambanja in the province of Antsirananana will be completed during the first year&#13;
of the project.&#13;
D. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, ACCOUNTING AND INTERNAL AUDIT&#13;
4.10   The organization of the financial and administrative services will take account of the&#13;
functional demands of the integrated financial management system proposed for the project. The&#13;
system favors the production of budget and accounting information for use by the project&#13;
management, in the place of the existing demotivating bureaucratic financial control system, which&#13;
is administratively slow and based on outdated principles. The details of the organizational&#13;
structure are presented in the Implementation Volume to this report. The different elements of the&#13;
system will include analytical and budget accounting, general accounting, fund management and&#13;
the management of purchases and inventory. The requirements of the public finance system will be&#13;
taken into account. An accelerated training program to ensure staff capacity to handle the new&#13;
system will be implemented shortly after credit effectiveness anid be followed by in-service training&#13;
throughout the project to ensure that the principles of the system are fully applied.&#13;
E. MONITORING AND EVALUATION&#13;
4.11   Experience has shown that two principal indicators provide a measure of the external&#13;
effectiveness of any extension service: (a) the level of participation of farmers (men and women),&#13;
which provides an indication of the level of interest of farmers and thus of the relevance of the&#13;
technical messages and/or the capacity of the extension work to persuade the farmers to undertake&#13;
demonstrations on their own farms; and (ii) the rate of adoption of the technical messages being&#13;
promoted. The rate of adoption is an excellent measure of the effectiveness of extension and&#13;
research staff to propose innovations which provide solutions to the real needs of farmers and&#13;
which can be adopted with the means at their disposal. Thus, monitoring and evaluation indicators&#13;
will include, in addition to the rate of adoption: (a) the participation rate of farmers (men and&#13;
women) potentially interested in a given extension theme attending fortnightly meetings; (b) the&#13;
total number of contact groups; (c) the number of demonstration plots and trial plots; (d)&#13;
comparison of yields on demonstration plots and on control plots; and (e) the evolution of the&#13;
national production of rice.  Quarterly meetings of extension agents, using data provided by&#13;
farmers, are held to review changes in indicators and to determine what remedial actions are&#13;
needed. In addition, an independent beneficiary assessment focused on farmners and field staff will&#13;
be carried out two years after project start-up to determine the cffectiveness of the extension&#13;
services and of these simplified monitoring and evaluation criteria&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24                   MA DA CASCAR: Agricultural Extension Program Support Project&#13;
4.12   The monitoring and evaluation unit will ensure rapid centralization of data generated by&#13;
the monitoring units at the regional level on the evolution of the performance indicators, to measure&#13;
the effectiveness of extension. A first round of analysis of data collected by the survey staff will&#13;
take place with field level extension staff during their fortnightlv meeting with their supervisors.&#13;
Data will bc transmitted to the provincial monitoring and evaluation units and fonvarded to the&#13;
central service after having been summarized. The three monthly review meetings held among staff&#13;
responsible for the national program will provide an opportunity to distribute and analyze the data.&#13;
Appropriate recommendations will be made and steps taken by all levels of staff concemed.&#13;
4. 13   An independent evaluation of the impact of extension will be undertaken two years after&#13;
project start-up. The Bank's resident staff will provide special support to the monitoring and&#13;
evaluation effort. If implementation slows for any reason. these will be reflected in a modified&#13;
annual work program.&#13;
4.14   Approximately thirty months after credit effectiveness and in no case later than October&#13;
31. 1998. a mid-term review of the project would be carried out to evaluate results and make&#13;
recommendations for the preparation of the next phase of the program, including proposals for&#13;
such changes as mav be necessary. The review will be based on the progress report on project&#13;
implementation (para. 3.41) and the annual work program, budget, financing plan, etc. (para 3.40)&#13;
to be prepared by September 30, 1998. The documentation prepared for the mid-term review will&#13;
present an analysis of project implementation experience and will contain proposals for a new cycle&#13;
of investments in support of the next phase of the agricultural extension program. Assurances to&#13;
this effect were received during negotiations (par. 5.1 (iii)).&#13;
F. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY, BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
4.15   Environmental Impact.  In the light of the neutral or marginally positive environmental&#13;
impact of the projcct, a category C rating has been assigned to it for environmental assessment&#13;
purposes.  No separate environment assessment has therefore been prepared.  Technical&#13;
recommendations, including environmental protection measures such as the adoption of soil&#13;
protection recommendations on the hill slopes and catchment areas above irrigation schemes, and&#13;
the integration of livestock husbandry' and fertility maintenance through composting, which have&#13;
already begun to be adopted under the pilot extension project (Credit 2150-MAG), will continue.&#13;
Field staff training already emphasizes environmental conservation, which will be intensified as&#13;
the program expands. An efficient agricultural extension service could be one of the key elements&#13;
of a national environmental monitoring system, which is currently being developed under the&#13;
National Environment Progyram. The project will ensure close collaboration with the national&#13;
agencies (Ministry of Environment/ONE) responsible for environment control and monitoring.&#13;
4.16   Project Sustainability.  The cost of ongoing extension projects in the 1994 budget was&#13;
over US$12.9 million, of which Government counterpart funding was US$2.3 million. As ongoing&#13;
projects integrate the national extension program, these funds will be available for funding the&#13;
national program. The proposed funding for four years is expected to be a first tranche in support&#13;
of this effort and additional Bank funding for extension could be considered if the program is&#13;
successful and it remains as a priority in the CAS. To ensure long term sustainability, the annual&#13;
cost of extension services wvill be limited to the equivalent of US$5 per farm family per annum,&#13;
which is considerably lower than the unit cost of ongoing extension initiatives. Through more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Chapter 4: Project Organization and Implementation                                25&#13;
professional and regular farm extension services, which will require a continuing financial&#13;
commitment from the Government, the project will also contribute to reestablish a degree of&#13;
confidence between the administration and the farming community, which is currently lacking and&#13;
which should, if successful, ensure longer term sustainability of project efforts. Over time,&#13;
improved prosperity of the farming sector may permit cost recovery and generate a demand for&#13;
extension services from sources other than those funded publicly.&#13;
4.17   Benefits. The project is expected to result in: (i) sustained increases in the production and&#13;
productivity of crop and livestock activities and thus improved farmer incomes; (ii) access to&#13;
improved agricultural services for a significant proportion of the country's 1.5 million rural&#13;
agricultural families. This population comprises several of the poorest segments of the rural&#13;
population including women; (iii) improved extension-research-farmer linkages, with research and&#13;
extension being more demand-driven and oriented to the farmers' needs through farmer contact and&#13;
the AMRT process; (iv) better coordination and complementarity in the delivery of agricultural&#13;
services between the public and private sectors; and (v) human resource development, as a result of&#13;
continuous training and education programs for farmers, herders and government staff; (v) greater&#13;
environmental sustainability of agricultural practices. A number of independent extension and&#13;
training projects will be brought together over time to support the single national program, thus&#13;
rationalizing the use of scarce resources. This will result in a net reduction of public expenditure&#13;
in the agricultural sector.&#13;
4.18   Expected increases from the adoption of simple improved techniques for rice production,&#13;
requiring little or no incremental monetary investment, as well as increases in acreage, are&#13;
anticipated to represent a cumulative increase in production of 460,000 tons by the end of Year 4,&#13;
or an incremental production of 30,000 tons in 1995, 65,000 tons in 1996, 140,000 tons in 1997&#13;
and 225,000 tons in 1998 . This represents a gross margin of approximately US$55 million to&#13;
farmers at a farm gate price of FMG 500/kg (Annex VII) for rice alone. Response to improved&#13;
techniques for off-season production or production of dryland crops has been impressive under the&#13;
pilot project, with returns rivaling those from rice production. Increases in average yields recorded&#13;
in the six pilot districts in 1993/94 from adopting intensive rice production techniques vary from&#13;
2.3 to 4.4 tons/ha or the equivalent gross margin of US$275 to US$525 per ha. Average&#13;
incremental yields of rice applying less labor intensive recommendations have varied between 1.0&#13;
and 3.0 tons/ha in irrigated rice and 0.9 and 1.4 tons/ha for rainfed rice. Maize yields have&#13;
increased from 0.60 to 2.0 tons/ha, yields of beans from 0.2 to 1.3 tons per hectare, yields of&#13;
groundnuts from 0.3 to 0.6 tons/ha and cassava from 8 to 10 tons per hectare. Similar results may&#13;
be expected as the program expands to other areas of the country.&#13;
4.19   A most detailed and independent evaluation of the benefits of the agricultural extension&#13;
system which is being introduced in Madagascar was carried out for Kenya and Burkina Faso in&#13;
3&#13;
1993. Results showed that (a) about 45 percent of farmers surveyed in both countries receive&#13;
direct extension advice within 10 years of system introduction; (b) about 70 percent of all farmers&#13;
had adopted simple new technologies; and (c) crop yields in Burkina were 30 percent higher for&#13;
farmers who belonged to extension groups than for farmers who did not. Rates of return for the&#13;
investments in both countries were estimated to be in excess of 100 percent. Similarly, a high&#13;
return on the proposed investment is expected for this project. A subsequent evaluation estimnated&#13;

that well managed, well disciplined and competent extension programs, such as those being&#13;
pursued across Africa, could contribute as much as 2 percent to the gross domestic product over&#13;
the next ten years.&#13;
4.20   Madagascar has already benefited from the accumulated experience of the agricultural&#13;
extension systems initiated elsewhere in Africa and recent progress under the pilot project has&#13;
shown the potential for emulating these successful experiences. Benefits will be closely monitored&#13;
to provide further substantive evidence of the effectiveness of agricultural extension delivery, as&#13;
described in the document "Le Systeme National de Vulgarisation Agricole Li Madagascar",&#13;
reproduced in the Implementation Volume to this report.&#13;
4.21   Risks. Pilot project experience suggests the following risks, but various elements of the&#13;
proposed project are expected to reduce their impact: (i) good management is essential to&#13;
successful project implementation.  The present management team  has demonstrated sound&#13;
capacity. Nomination of staff for key regional posts will be closely monitored. (ii) In the new&#13;
extension districts, representatives of all ongoing projects, government services, NGOs and private&#13;
companies with a vocation in extension or research will be associated to reduce the risk of poor&#13;
collaboration between different services. (iii) As regards the risk of shortage of counterpart funds&#13;
and long term fiscal sustainability, provision of an initial contribution of local funds will be made a&#13;
condition of effectiveness. Thereafter, the reduction of independent projects will increase the&#13;
capacity of the Government to fund the single national program. More than forty percent of the&#13;
public expenditure in the agricultural sector is currently being devoted to agricultural extension&#13;
activities through a plethora of separate and uncoordinated projects. (iv) Monitoring of close&#13;
collaboration between research and extension and programming of training will be major themes&#13;
for project supervision to ensure longer terrn improved technical capacity. The case for funding the&#13;
rehabilitation of the country's six agricultural colleges is based on the need to meet the anticipated&#13;
risk of longer term insufficient supply of qualified agricultural staff. (v) There is finally the risk&#13;
that integration of other projects into the national system may not take place, thus reducing the cost&#13;
savings envisaged from reducing demands on counterpart funds.  The Government will be&#13;
encouraged to continue to coordinate efforts among donors to ensure maximum support for its&#13;
national policy.&#13;

5. AGREEMENTS TO BE REACHED WITH THE BORROWER,&#13;
CONDITIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
5.1    The following assurances were obtained during negotiations:&#13;
i) The project's accounts will be audited by independent auditors acceptable to IDA, and&#13;
in accordance with appropriate auditing principles, consistently applied (para 3.39);&#13;
ii) A draft annual work program, a budget and financing plan incorporating the annual&#13;
training program, details of procurement and other agreed project details will be prepared&#13;
and submitted to IDA for comments and approval by the end of September of the&#13;
preceding year (para 3.40); and half-yearly progress reports will be submitted to IDA at&#13;
the end of March and at the end of September each year (para 3.41)&#13;
iii) Government shall, (a) no later than October 31 each year carry out an annual review,&#13;
including a review of the Public Expenditure Program for the agricultural sector (para&#13;
3.44); and (b) not later than October 31, 1998, a mid-term review of the project (para&#13;
4.14);&#13;
5.2    The following would be a condition of effectiveness of the credit:&#13;
The deposit of an initial amount equivalent to US$ 100,000 by Government to the project&#13;
advance account (para 3.34).&#13;
5.3    With the above assurances and conditions, the above project is suitable for an IDA Credit&#13;
of SDR 16.2 million.&#13;

Subject. Aide-memoire of World Bank supervision mission for the&#13;
National Agricultural Extension Program (October 7-21, 1994)&#13;
MEADR extension policy&#13;
Reference: CFD's letter No. 3990 of September 27 and December 1994 letter bearing joint signature&#13;
Gentlemen,&#13;
In June 1994, the representatives of your respective delegations attended the working meeting that I convened&#13;
for the purpose of presenting both my Government's agricultural extension policy and a proposal for setting&#13;
up a national professional agricultural extension system. The details of this system are set down in the&#13;
document sent to you prior to the June meeting. Following that meeting, at which few substantive comments&#13;
were offered, my staff proceeded to implement the new national system, taking as a basis the positive&#13;
experiences acquired during the Agricultural Extension Pilot Project financed by the World Bank in the six&#13;
extension districts of the Faritany of Toamasina and Antananarivo.&#13;
As part of the implementation process, a workshop was held at Toliary, attended by representatives of your&#13;
respective delegations and of the World Bank  The Director of Agriculture, who chaired the opemng&#13;
sessions, presented the guidelines of the national agricultural extension policy and listed the workshop's&#13;
objectives. This was a good opportunity for the representatives of all projects, agencies and services in the&#13;
region connected with technical training, research or extension to come together and formulate joint&#13;
proposals for the components and various stages of implementation of a cohesive and harmonized system&#13;
enabling all actors and beneficiaries concerned to make mutually productive use of their individual&#13;
experiences and resources.&#13;
In your letter to me of December 1994 concerning the aide-memoire of the Bank's supervision mission, you&#13;
mention the reservations expressed by your three institutions concerning the approach agreed at Toliary&#13;
within the PNVA framework. Your reservations have been noted by my staff, and will be borne in mind&#13;
whenever the program is launched in any of the regions concerned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40                                                                                Annex III&#13;
Once again, I wish to confirm my department's decision to set up a national agricultural extension system&#13;
based on principles that were clearly expressed during the various interviews at the Ministry and in the field&#13;
and specifically outlined in the documents forwarded in June 1994. As you know, the system is based on the&#13;
following principles:&#13;
-well-organized work plans&#13;
-systematic and continuing training of extension agents&#13;
-close links among research, extension, and farmers&#13;
-monitoring and evaluation of the system's costs and performance under real conditions&#13;
I should emphasize that the harmonized extension system comprises three sets of activities: conveyance of&#13;
technical messages concerning agriculture in the broad sense (fanning, stodcraising, fruit and vegetables,&#13;
environment, fish fanning) to contact farmer groups; fanming research, developed through close&#13;
collaboration among researchers, extension agents and farmers; and advice on business organization and&#13;
management for professional fanmer associations and groups. It is my sincere hope that the experience&#13;
gleaned and know-how demonstrated in the projects you finance will contribute to the success of this&#13;
program, particularly by serving as support for the associations and groups, and that the actions undertaken&#13;
will help to curtail duplication of efforts and costs while producing rapid and effective results within the&#13;
farming community. I trust that the meeting chaired by the Director General of Technical Services on&#13;
January 31, 1995 has succeeded in removing the "question marks" concerning implementation of the&#13;
niational extension system and will trigger the appropriate consultations on the subject.&#13;
As you will realize, the national system is to be implemented with a high degree of participation by all actors&#13;
on the development scene. Its aim is not to monopolize the services provided to the fanmers or to subsume&#13;
other projects or service providers, but rather to maximize the effectiveness of the public extension and&#13;
research services in close liaison with the various projects, private firms and NGOs, seeking the highest&#13;
return on the respective investments while making optimum use of available human, material and financial&#13;
resources.&#13;
I should be happy to receive any proposals relevant to our policy that could supplement the national system,&#13;
now being progressively implemented in all regions&#13;
I wish to reiterate my sincere appreciation for the assistance you are providing for the development of my&#13;
country's agriculture sector, and to assure you that I am at your disposal for any further information.&#13;
Very truly yours,&#13;

            The objectives of the National
            Agricultural Extension Program Support Project are to
            increase agricultural productivity and farmers' incomes
            in an environmentally sustainable manner and to rationalize
            the use of public resources in support of agricultural
            services. The program is central to the Government's
            strategy to: 1) reduce poverty and improve the conditions of
            life in the rural areas; 2) improve agricultural
            productivity; 3) optimize the use of available resources;
            and 4) protect the environment by generalizing the delivery
            of professional agricultural services to all levels of the
            farming community. The main project components are: 1)
            strengthening the delivery of the agricultural extension
            services and providing support for farmers'
            organizations through the provision of transport, equipment,
            rehabilitation of facilities and incremental operating
            costs; 2) improving the technical and management capacity of
            agricultural staff through training by the provision of
            equipment, supplies, facilities and transport for regular
            in-service training of extension staff and the
            rehabilitation of at least two agricultural training
            colleges; and 3) support for financial management,
            accounting and auditing, monitoring and evaluation and
            regular supervision at all levels of the national
            agricultural extension system.
