ADJUSTMENT TO EXTERNAL SHOCKS IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES&#13;
A Background Study for World Development Report 1981&#13;
This paper analyzes adjustments to external shocks, in the form&#13;
of changes in the terms of trade and the slowdown in foreign export demand,&#13;
in twenty-eight developing economies, classified according to the character&#13;
of external shocks, the level of industrial development, and the policies&#13;
applied. It is shown that newly industrializing economies (NICs) responded&#13;
to adverse external shocks through domestic adjustment policies in the form&#13;
of export promotion, import substitution, and a (temporary) slowdown in the&#13;
rate of economic growth, whereas less developed economies (LDCs) placed&#13;
reliance largely on foreign borrowing.&#13;
At the same time, within both the NIC and the LDC groups, outward-&#13;
oriented economies made more successful domestic adjustment through increases&#13;
in export shares and import substitution than inward-oriented economies.&#13;
Correspondingly, after an initial slowdown, economic growth accelerated in&#13;
the first group, whereas the opposite result is observed in the second. The&#13;
results are confirmed by a cross-section investigation of the twenty-four&#13;
developing economies that suffered adverse external shocks in the period&#13;
1974-1978.&#13;
The observed difference in rates of economic growth are explained by&#13;
the fact that outward-oriented economies had lower incremental capital-output&#13;
ratios and higher savings ratios than inward-oriented economies. In turn, in&#13;
developing economies benefiting from favorable external shocks, ambitious&#13;
investment programs gave rise to high incremental capital-output ratios that&#13;
largely offset increases in their savings ratios.&#13;

I. Analyzing Adjustment Policies in Developing Economies&#13;
Drawing in large part on the results of two earlier studies, 1/ this&#13;
paper will analyze adjustments to external shocks in twenty-eight developing&#13;
economies that cover a broad range in terms of the level of development, the&#13;
character of external shocks, and the policies applied. The investigation&#13;
does not, however, include the poorest countries of Africa and Asia, where&#13;
overall development problems predominate.&#13;
Introduction&#13;
In the 1974-78 period, developing economies experienced external&#13;
shocks in the form of changes in the terms of trade and the slowdown of&#13;
demand for their exports. The quadrupling of oil prices adversely affected&#13;
the balance of payments of most non-OPEC developing economies. These effects&#13;
were aggravated by the deterioration of the non-oil terms of trade in some&#13;
cases and were alleviated by price improvements in others. In most non-OPEC&#13;
developing economies, a net deterioration of the terms of trade ensued, but&#13;
several economies experienced a net improvement.&#13;
The slowdown of foreign demand f'ound its origin in the world&#13;
recession of 1974-75 and the subsequent slow recovery. It adversely affected&#13;
the balance of payments of all developing economies, thereby aggravating the&#13;
negative terms-of-trade effects suffered by most of the non-OPEC group. Some&#13;
developing economies, in particular those exporting cocoa and coffee, however,&#13;
experienced favorable external shocks as improvements in their terms of trade&#13;
more than offset the negative export-volume effects.&#13;

Oil Crisis," Weltwirtschaftliches Archiv, Band 117, Heft 1, and The Policy&#13;
Experience of Twelve Less Developed 'Countries, 1973-79, World Bank Staff&#13;

provide the formulas used in the process of estimation.&#13;

Developing countries that experienced unfavorable external shocks&#13;
had various policy measures at their disposal to adjust to these shocks. The&#13;
policy alternatives included increasing reliance on external financing as&#13;
well as domestic adjustment policies in the form of export promotion, import&#13;
substitution, and temporary lowering of the rate of economic growth through&#13;
restrictive macroeconomic policies. In turn, developing countries where the&#13;
net effects of external shocks were favorable may have curtailed their&#13;
reliance on external financing, reduced efforts aimed at export promotion and&#13;
import substitution, or followed expansionary policies.&#13;
Particular policy measures may also have been taken independently of&#13;
external shocks and may themselves constitute an "internal shock." An excessively&#13;
expansionary policy, financed by foreign borrowing, provides an example of such a&#13;
shock; the economic effects of political change, including revolution, provide&#13;
another.&#13;
Country Coverage&#13;
Among the twenty-eight developing economies whose policy experience is&#13;
analyzed in this paper, twelve belong to the newly industrializing group, defined&#13;
to include developing economies where per capita incomes were between $1100 and&#13;
$3500 in 1978 and where the share of the manufacturing sector in the gross&#13;
domestic product (GDP) was 20 percent or higher in 1977 (Table 1). The investi-&#13;
gation includes every newly industrializing economy except Greece, Hong Kong, and&#13;
Spain. 1/&#13;
1/ The data have been derived from the World Bank, World Development Report, 1979&#13;
(New York: Oxford University Press, 1979) and World Bank Atlas, 1979 (Washington,&#13;
D.C., 1980). Following the practice of various international organizations,&#13;
Ireland, with a per capita income of $3470 has been excluded from the group.&#13;

All newly industrializing economies experienced adverse external shocks&#13;
during the period under consideration, but they differed in terms of the policies&#13;
applied. In the early 1960s the three Far Eastern economies -- Korea, Singapore,&#13;
and Taiwan -- adopted an outward-oriented development strategy, providing similar&#13;
incentives to sales in domestic and in foreign markets, and continued with this&#13;
strategy after 1973. They were joined by Chile and Uruguay, which had earlier&#13;
applied an inward-oriented strategy but turned outward following the external&#13;
shocks of 1974-75. In turn, after earlier efforts to reduce the bias in the&#13;
incentive system against exports, Brazil, Israel, Portugal, and Yugoslavia again&#13;
increased the degree of inward orientation, whereas Argentina, Mexico, and Turkey&#13;
maintained their relatively inward-oriented stance. At the same time, in three of&#13;
the newly industrializing economies internal shocks predominated; they took the&#13;
form of excessive expansionary policies in Argentina and Mexico, and they reflected&#13;
the economic effects of the April 1974 Revolution in Portugal.&#13;
The paper further analyzes the experience of twelve less developed&#13;
economies, which cover the spectrum between the newly industrializing and the&#13;
least developed economies, that experienced adverse external shocks after 1973.&#13;
Four of them -- Kenya, Mauritius, Thailand, and Tunisia -- may be categorized as&#13;
having applied outward-oriented policies, whereas the remaining eight followed an&#13;
inward-oriented development strategy. Within the latter group, Jamaica, Peru, and&#13;
Tanzania experienced internal shocks in the form of economic disruptions resulting&#13;
from government policies; such was not the case in the other five economies of the&#13;
group (Egypt, India, Morocco, the Philippines, and Zambia).&#13;
Finally, the investigation includes four developing economies that&#13;
experienced favorable external shocks. These economies are: Indonesia and&#13;
Nigeria, which benefited from the rise of oil prices; the Ivory Coast, where&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
increases in the price of cocoa and coffee more than offset the adverse effects of&#13;
higher oil prices; and Colombia, which enjoyed the rise in coffee prices without&#13;
being burdened by the higher prices of petroleum. (Table 2 summarizes the estimates&#13;
made for each of the twenty-eight developing economies.)&#13;
External Shocks&#13;
The balance-of-payments effects of external shocks, in the form of&#13;
changes in the terms of trade and the slowdown of foreign demand, have been&#13;
estimated by postulating a situation that would have existed in the absence of&#13;
external shocks. Terms-of-trade effects have been calculated as the difference&#13;
between the current price values of exports and imports and their constant price&#13;
values, estimated in the prices of the 1971-73 ("1972") base period. They have&#13;
further been decomposed into a "pure terms-of-trade effect," calculated on the&#13;
assumption that the balance of trade expressed in "1972" prices was in equilibrium,&#13;
and an "unbalanced trade effect," indicating the impact of the rise of import&#13;
prices on the deficit (surplus) in the balance of trade expressed in "1972" prices.&#13;
This procedure reflects the assumption that price increases since "1972" have&#13;
been due to external shocks, in particular the direct and indirect effects of the&#13;
quadrupling of oil prices.&#13;
The effects of the slowdown of foreign demand on exports have been&#13;
calculated as the difference between the trend value of exports and hypothetical&#13;
exports. The trend value of exports has been derived on the assumptions that the&#13;
growth rate of foreign demand for particular export products and product groups&#13;
remained the same as in the 1963-73 period and that the particular economy main-&#13;
tained its "1972" share of these exports. In turn, hypothetical exports have been&#13;
estimated on the assumption that the economy in question maintained its "1972"&#13;
market share in the actual exports of individual products and product groups&#13;
during the period under consideration.&#13;

Estimates have been made for traditional primary exports, defined to&#13;
include products that constituted at least 1.5 percent of total exports in "1972,"&#13;
taken individually, as well as for nontraditional primary products, fuels, and&#13;
manufactured goods. In regard to manufactured goods, the effects of changes in&#13;
foreign gross national product (GNP) growth rates and of changes in foreign income&#13;
elasticities of import demand (the ratio of the rate of growth of imports to that&#13;
of GNP) have further been distinguished.&#13;
Adjustment Policies&#13;
The balance-of-payments effects of adjustment policies have also been&#13;
estimated by hypothesizing a situation thaLt would have existed in the absence of&#13;
external shocks. However, the methodology applied does not permit separating the&#13;
effects of policy changes undertaken in response to external shocks from those of&#13;
autonomous policy changes, which may themselves constitute an internal shock. The&#13;
distinction between the two necessarily becomes a matter of interpretation.&#13;
Additional net external financing has been derived as the difference&#13;
between the actual merchandise trade balance and the trade balance that would have&#13;
been obtained if trends in imports and exports observed in the 1963-73 period had&#13;
continued and import and export prices had remained at their "1972" level. Nonfactor&#13;
services and private transfers do not enter into the calculation of additional net&#13;
external financing because they are assumed to be unaffected by external shocks.&#13;
The effects of export promotion have been calculated as the changes in&#13;
exports that result from changes in the country's "1972" export market shares. In&#13;
turn, import substitution has been defined as the savings in imports associated&#13;
with a decrease in the income elasticity of import demand as compared with the&#13;
1963-73 period.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Finally, the effects on imports of changes in GNP growth rates in&#13;
response to the macroeconomic policies followed have been calculated on the&#13;
assumption of unchanged income elasticities of import demand. This pertains&#13;
to the impact of short-term policies, whereas long-term growth performance is&#13;
affected by the allocation of existing and incremental resources and the rate&#13;
of savings.&#13;
II. The Balance-of-Payments Effects of External Shocks&#13;
This section will provide estimates of the balance-of-payments effects&#13;
of external shocks, in the form of terms-of-trade effects and export-volume&#13;
effects, for groups of the twenty-eight developing economies. Table 3A presents&#13;
estimates for the years 1974 to 1978, taken individually, as well as averages for&#13;
these years, and appendix Table A-1 shows average results for the period in a&#13;
disaggregated framework. Table 3B relates terms-of-trade effects to the average&#13;
of exports and imports and to GNP, all expressed in "1972" prices.&#13;
Terms-of-Trade Effects&#13;
In the twenty-four developing economies experiencing adverse external&#13;
shocks, average terms-of-trade effects (expressed as a percentage of GNP) reached&#13;
a peak of 4.7 percent in 1975, declined to 2.9 percent by 1977, and increased again&#13;
to 3.6 percent in 1978; the average figure for the 1974-78 period was 3.5 percent.&#13;
The ratio of the terms-of-trade loss to the average value of exports and imports&#13;
showed a similar pattern over time and averaged 34.9 percent in the 1974-78 period.&#13;
Variations in terms-of-trade effects are largely explained by changes in&#13;
the relative prices of fuel and nonfuel primary commodities. Expressed in constant&#13;
dollars by deflating with the export prices of manufactured goods, oil prices&#13;
increased threefold in 1974 and declined afterwards to four-fifths of the 1974&#13;
level in 1978. The index of constant dollar prices of other primary products&#13;

reached a peak -- exceeding the 1973 leveL by one-tenth -- in 1974 when the&#13;
effects of the 1972-73 world economic boom were still apparent. The index fell&#13;
by over one-fifth in 1975 in response to the world recession, regained one-half&#13;
of its loss by 1977, and declined to 80 percent of the 1973 level in 1978 when&#13;
the prices of tropical beverages slumped.&#13;
Similar patterns were observed in the newly industrializing (NIC) as&#13;
well as in the less developed (LDC) groups, except that in the latter case the&#13;
terms-of-trade loss reached a peak in 1978 rather than 1975. This is because&#13;
the LDCs suffered the adverse effects of increases in the prices of manufactured&#13;
goods, which account for a larger share of their imports and for a smaller&#13;
share of their exports than in the case of the NICs. For the same reason, the&#13;
ratio of the terms-of-trade loss to GNP was somewhat greater in the LDCs than&#13;
in the NICs. The difference was larger, nearly one-sixth, if the terms-of-trade&#13;
loss was related to the average value of exports and imports, since the share&#13;
of foreign trade in GNP was higher in the NICs than in the LDCs.&#13;
Among the LDCs and, in particular, among the NICs, outward-oriented&#13;
economies suffered substantially larger terms-of-trade losses in relation to&#13;
their GNPs than did inward-oriented economies. The differences are explained&#13;
by the higher share of foreign trade in GNP under outward orientation; the&#13;
opposite result was obtained in relating terms-of-trade losses to the average&#13;
value of exports and imports.&#13;
Terms-of-trade gains for the group of economies experiencing favorable&#13;
external shocks varied between 9.2 percent and 14.4 percent of GNP, with an&#13;
average of 11.8 percent in the 1974-78 period. In the same period, the terms-&#13;
of-trade gain slightly exceeded the average value of exports and imports,&#13;
measured in "1972" prices.&#13;

Export-Volume Effects&#13;
In the twenty-four developing economies experiencing adverse&#13;
external shocks, the unfavorable export-volume effects increased from 0.2&#13;
percent of GNP in 1974 to 1.6 percent in 1978, with fluctuations over time in&#13;
response to the business cycle; the average ratio was 1.0 percent for the whole&#13;
period. A similar pattern was obtained in relating the export shortfall to the&#13;
value of exports, with an average of 11.7 percent for the entire period.&#13;
The export shortfall was larger, averaging 1.8 percent of GNP and&#13;
18.8 percent of export value, in economies experiencing gains in the terms of&#13;
trade. The differences are explained mainly by the slowdown in the growth of&#13;
foreign demand for petroleum in response to higher prices that adversely&#13;
affected Indonesia and Nigeria in the group.&#13;
Among economies experiencing unfavorable external shocks, the adverse&#13;
export-volume effects, expressed as a percentage of GNP, were slightly larger&#13;
for the LDCs than for the NICs; the difference exceeded one-third if the export&#13;
shortfall was related to the value of exports, and this reflects the higher&#13;
export shares of the NICs. At the same time, outward-oriented economies&#13;
experienced a smaller export shortfall, expressed as a percentage of export&#13;
value, than did inward-oriented economies, largely because of relatively&#13;
favorable changes in demand for manufactured goods, which account for a higher&#13;
share in the exports of the former group.&#13;
In fact, the ex post income elasticity of demand in the developed&#13;
countries for the manufactured goods originating in the developing economies&#13;
(defined as the ratio of the rate of growth of imports to that of GNP) increased&#13;
over time and offset about one-fourth of the export shortfall due to the deceler-&#13;
ation of economic growth in the developed countries. At the same time, increases&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
in the income elasticity of demand enhanced the favorable effects of the&#13;
acceleration of economic growth in the developing economies, although this was&#13;
in large part offset by the combined effects of decreases in GNP growth rates&#13;
and in the income elasticity of demand in the centrally planned economies.&#13;
Within the newly industrializing group, however, the ratio of the&#13;
export shortfall to GNP was substantially higher in outward-oriented than in&#13;
inward-oriented economies because the share of exports in GNP was larger in the&#13;
former than in the latter. The difference between the results was reduced, but&#13;
a reversal did not occur in the LDC group, where the decline in the rate of&#13;
growth of demand for bauxite and alumina in Jamaica raised the export shortfall&#13;
to a considerable extent.&#13;
Terms-of-Trade versus Export-Volume Effects&#13;
The ratio of terms-of-trade effects to export-volume effects showed&#13;
a declining tendency over time in economies experiencing adverse external&#13;
shocks. Nevertheless, in 1978 the average terms-of-trade loss was still more&#13;
than twice the amount of export shortfall in the group. For the entire period,&#13;
terms-of-trade effects exceeded export-volume effects more than three times,&#13;
with little difference shown between the NICs and the LDCs.&#13;
The results indicate the importance of the quadrupling of oil prices,&#13;
which accounted for much of the deterioration of the terms of trade of the&#13;
non-OPEC developing economies, and conflict with the conventional wisdom that&#13;
places emphasis on the unfavorable effects of the 1974-75 world recession and&#13;
the subsequent slow recovery. This conclusion gains in force if we consider&#13;
that the quadrupling of oil prices contributed to the 1974-75 world recession,&#13;
both directly and indirectly, by triggering the application of strong deflationary&#13;
policies to reduce the rate of inflation and safeguard the balance of payments&#13;
in the developed economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
In turn, higher oil prices accounted for practically the entire gain&#13;
in the terms of trade of the four developing economies experiencing favorable&#13;
external shocks. In the 1974-78 period, their terms-of-trade gains on the&#13;
average exceeded the shortfall of exports more than six times, with the favorable&#13;
balance-of-payments effects of external shocks averaging 10.0 percent of GNP.&#13;
In contrast, the adverse balance-of-payments effects of external&#13;
shocks averaged 4.5 percent of GNP in the twenty-four developing economies that&#13;
experienced unfavorable external shocks. These adverse effects were greater for&#13;
the LDCs (5.0 percent) than for the NICs (4.3 percent) because of the larger&#13;
terms-of-trade and export-volume effects in the former group.&#13;
Among the NICs, the adverse balance-of-payments effects of external&#13;
shocks were substantially greater in outward-oriented (8.0 percent of GNP) than&#13;
in inward-oriented (3.6 percent) economies. External shocks were also larger&#13;
under outward orientation (6.1 percent) than under inward orientation (4.9&#13;
percent) in LDCs, but the differences were smaller in this case.&#13;
III. The Balance-of-Payments Effects of the Policies Applied&#13;
The preceding section analyzed the impact of external shocks, in the&#13;
form of terms-of-trade effects and export-volume effects, on the balance of&#13;
payments of various groups of twenty-eight developing economies. This section&#13;
will analyze the balance-of-payments effects of the policies applied, with&#13;
distinction made between additional net external financing and domestic adjust-&#13;
ment policies in the form of export promotion, import substitution, and&#13;
(temporary) lowering of the rate of economic growth.&#13;
The balance-of-payments effects of the policies applied are shown in&#13;
Table 3A, and Table 3B relates the results to the value of exports, imports,&#13;
average trade, and GNP, as the case may be, with all values expressed in "1972&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
prices. Mlore detailed estimates are shown in appendix Table A-1. In turn,&#13;
Table 4 provides information on the financing of the resource gap and Table 5&#13;
on the debt service and the external debt.&#13;
Additional Net External Financing&#13;
The twenty-four developing economies experiencing adverse external&#13;
shocks more than offset the balance-of-payments effects of these shocks by&#13;
additional net external financing in 1974. Additional net external financing&#13;
declined in subsequent years but increased again in 1978, when it offset 40&#13;
percent of the balance-of-payments effects of external shocks; the average&#13;
ratio for the entire period was 68 percent.&#13;
Total external financing -- the sum of the actual resource gap&#13;
(net external financing), interest payments, and dividends -- showed a similar&#13;
pattern, except that interest payments on debt contracted in earlier years&#13;
raised financing requirements to a considerable extent in later years. As a&#13;
result, the ratio of the gross debt service (including interest payments as&#13;
well as amortization) to merchandise exports increased from 26 percent in 1973&#13;
to 37 percent in 1978. Even larger increases were shown in the ratio of the&#13;
gross external debt to GNP: an increase from 16 percent in 1973 to 24 percent&#13;
in 1978. 1/&#13;
In 1974 additional net external financing exceeded the balance-of-&#13;
payments effects of external shocks in both the NICs and the LDCs. But although&#13;
in the NICs additional net external financing turned negative after 1975, it&#13;
continued to exceed the balance-of-payments effects of external shocks in the LDCs.&#13;
With the growing burden of servicing the debt contracted to finance the&#13;
balance-of-payments deficits of earlier years and reserve accumulation in later&#13;
1/ All further references will relate to the gross debt service ratio and to the&#13;
gross external debt ratio.&#13;

years, debt service ratios and external debt ratios nevertheless continued&#13;
to rise in the NICs. Increases in these ratios were concentrated in inward-&#13;
oriented economies, whereas little change occurred in outward-oriented economies&#13;
that relied on domestic policies of adjustment.&#13;
Notwithstanding reliance on external financing in the LDCs, debt&#13;
service ratios rose only slightly more, and external debt ratios less, in the&#13;
LDCs than in the NICs. This result is explained by the fact that several less&#13;
developed economies received foreign grants and concessional loans.&#13;
Outward-oriented LDCs relied to a large extent on domestic adjustment&#13;
policies to adjust to external shocks and, correspondingly, experienced little&#13;
change in debt service ratios, whereas this ratio increased by one-half in inward-&#13;
oriented LDCs. Nor did the average external debt ratio of the outward-oriented&#13;
group reach the levels observed in the inward-oriented group, although the latter&#13;
includes recipients of foreign grants.&#13;
By far the highest debt service and external debt ratios were observed&#13;
in economies that experienced internal shocks. This result occurred even though,&#13;
due to liquidity problems, several members of the group had to cut back foreign&#13;
borrowing to a considerable extent toward the end of the period.&#13;
Finally, domestic policies increasingly burdened the balance of pay-&#13;
ments of economies experiencing favorable external shocks. With substantial&#13;
dividends paid to foreign investors in these economies, their total external&#13;
financing in fact increased in absolute terms after 1975. As a result, these&#13;
economies experienced an increase in the external debt ratio from 14 percent&#13;
in 1973 to 16 percent in 1978, although their debt service ratio remained at&#13;
7 percent.&#13;
&#13;

Domestic Adjustment Policies&#13;
In the twenty-four developing economies experiencing external shocks,&#13;
export promotion and import substitution assumed increasing importance over time,&#13;
whereas the slowdown of economic growth affected imports considerably in 1975,&#13;
with smaller increases afterwards.  Thus, losses in export market shares averaging&#13;
5 percent of export value in 1974 gave place to a gain of 5 percent in 1978;&#13;
negative import substitution equaling 7 percent of import value in 1974 turned&#13;
into positive import substitution of 14 percent by 1978; and the 6 percent decline&#13;
in imports due to the slowdown of economic growth in 1975 reached 9 percent in&#13;
1978. For the 1974-78 period on average, increases in export shares offset&#13;
2 percent of the balance-of-payments effects of external shocks; the corresponding&#13;
figures for import substitution and for the import effect of lower GNP growth rates&#13;
were 15 percent and 16 percent, respectively (Table 6).&#13;
Considerable differences in domestic adjustment policies, however,&#13;
were observed between the NICs and the LDCs. In the first group, on the average&#13;
export promotion offset 6 percent, import substitution 33 percent, and import&#13;
savings due to lower GNP growth rates 23 percent of the balance-of-payments&#13;
effects of external shocks in the 1974-78 period. In contrast, the LDCs exper-&#13;
ienced losses in export market shares (-10 percent of the balance-of-payments&#13;
effects of external shocks in 1974-78), negative import substitution (-26 percent),&#13;
and practically no import savings due to lower GNP growth rates (1 percent).&#13;
The average results for the NIC and the LDC groups, however, show&#13;
considerable differences between outward-oriented and inward-oriented economies.&#13;
In the case of NICs characterized by outward orientation, export promotion&#13;
(50 percent) nearly matched import substitution (54 percent) in cushioning the&#13;
balance-of-payments effects of external shocks in the 1974-78 period, whereas in&#13;
the case of inward-oriented NICs import substitution (24 percent) was accompanied&#13;

by losses in export market shares (-11 percent). The corresponding ratios for&#13;
outward-oriented and inward-oriented LDCs, respectively, were 20 percent and&#13;
-16 percent for export promotion and 19 percent and -36 percent for import&#13;
substitition.&#13;
The results indicate that, within both the NIC and the LDC groups,&#13;
outward-oriented economies made successful domestic adjustment, since they&#13;
not only gained export market shares but also did better in import substitution&#13;
than did inward-oriented economies. This result -- at first sight surprising --&#13;
may be explained by a reference to the effects of the policies applied. For&#13;
one thing, a low extent of discrimination against primary activities, a&#13;
relatively small degree of variation in iLncentive rates, and cost reductions&#13;
through the exploitation of economies of scale in export industries contributed&#13;
to efficient import substitution in outward-oriented economies. For another&#13;
thing, continued import substitution behind high protection brought diminishing&#13;
returns in net foreign exchange savings, and entailed considerable cost, under&#13;
inward orientation. _/&#13;
At the same time, import savings associated with the slowdown of&#13;
economic growth decreased after 1975 in economies pursuing an outward-oriented&#13;
development strategy, whereas the opposite conclusion applies to economies&#13;
characterized by inward orientation. The contrast is particularly pronounced&#13;
in the case of the NICs. Although outward-oriented NICs accepted a temporary&#13;
deceleration of economic growth, representing an import saving of 15 percent in&#13;
1975, their successful efforts in export promotion and import substitution led&#13;
to an acceleration of economic growth in subsequent years, with import savings&#13;

declining to 3 percent of import value in 1978. In turn, inward-oriented&#13;
NICs attempted to avoid a slowdown in economic growth through increased&#13;
import substitution, but the rate of economic growth fell in subsequent years&#13;
as import substitution proved to be increasingly costly, so that the ratio of&#13;
import savings to import value increased from -1 percent in 1974 to 19 percent&#13;
in 1978. Increases were even larger, from zero to 27 percent, in NICs&#13;
experiencing internal shocks; these economies also experienced considerable&#13;
losses in export market shares, equaling 18 percent of export value in the&#13;
1976-77 period, while import substitution was zero.&#13;
In the same period, import savings associated with the slowdown of&#13;
economic growth changed from slightly above zero to -5 percent of import value&#13;
in LDCs characterized by outward orientation, whereas an increase from zero to&#13;
2 percent occurred in inward-oriented LDCs. Within the latter group, the&#13;
slowdown of economic growth was especially pronounced in countries experiencing&#13;
internal shocks, with the resultant import savings increasing from 3 percent of&#13;
import value in 1974 to 28 percent in 1978. The results reflect the economic&#13;
dislocation associated with internal shocks, which also led to substantial&#13;
losses in export market shares, surpassing 17 percent of export value in the&#13;
1974-78 period. At the same time, increased protection and foreign exchange&#13;
stringency gave rise to some import substitution in these economies.&#13;
Economies benefiting from favorable external shocks showed small gains&#13;
in export shares and practically no change in imports because of changes in GNP&#13;
growth rates. However, they exhibited increasingly large negative import substi-&#13;
tution that offset 87 percent of the favorable balance-of-payments effects of&#13;
external shocks by 1978. This is largely explained by the high import intensity&#13;
of large-scale investments, which were undertaken by utilizing the increment in&#13;
export receipts and the proceeds of foreign borrowing.&#13;

IV. A Comparative Evaluation of the Results&#13;
We have shown that outward-oriented economies have been more success-&#13;
ful in overcoming the effects of external shocks through domestic adjustment,&#13;
involving export promotion as well as import substitution, than have inward-&#13;
oriented economies.  This is reflected in the growth performance of the two&#13;
groups.&#13;
Development Strategies and Economic Growth&#13;
Among the NICs, the average annual rate of growth of GNP in economies&#13;
pursuing an outward-oriented development strategy declined from 7.4 percent in&#13;
1963-73 to 5.9 percent in 1973-76 as several of them adopted deflationary&#13;
policies, but it rose again to 9.7 percent in 1976-79 (Table 7). 1/ In contrast,&#13;
in economies following inward-oriented po:Licies, rates of economic growth declined&#13;
from 6.9 percent in 1963-73 to 5.0 percent in 1973-76 and remained at this level&#13;
in 1976-79. The decline was even more pronounced in the case of NICs experiencing&#13;
internal shocks: a decrease from 5.5 percent in 1963-73 to 1.9 percent in&#13;
1973-76, with an increase to 4.4 percent :in 1976-79.&#13;
Among the LDCs, outward-oriented economies experienced a decline in&#13;
their average GNP growth rate from 7.3 percent in 1963-73 to 7.1 percent in&#13;
1973-76, followed by an increase to 7.9 percent in 1976-79. In turn, inward-&#13;
oriented LDCs increased their rates of economic growth from 3.9 percent in&#13;
1963-73 to 5.1 percent in 1973-76 but experienced a decline to 4.1 percent in&#13;
1976-79. Within the inward-oriented group, an uninterrupted decline is shown&#13;
for LDCs experiencing internal shocks, from 4.6 percent in 1963-73 to 3.0&#13;
percent in 1973-76 and, again, to 0.8 percent in 1976-79.&#13;
1/ Growth rates have been derived by regression analysis that has a margin of&#13;
error, particularly for short periods.&#13;

Finally, the data indicate that economies experiencing favorable external&#13;
shocks were not able to translate these gains into higher rates of economic growth&#13;
in a sustained fashion. Thus, although their average GNP growth rate increased&#13;
from 6.2 percent in 1963-73 to 8.0 percent: in 1973-76, the growth rate declined&#13;
again to 6.1 percent in 1976-79.&#13;
The favorable effects of an outward-oriented development strategy on&#13;
economic growth are also indicated by a cross-section investigation of the twenty-&#13;
four developing economies experiencing unfavorable external shocks. For the&#13;
1973-79 period taken as a whole, the Spearman rank correlation coefficient between&#13;
the extent of reliance on export promotion in response to external shocks (defined&#13;
as the ratio of export expansion associated with increases in export market shares&#13;
to the balance-of-payments effects of external shocks) and the rate of growth of GNP&#13;
was 0.60, statistically significant at the 1 percent level.&#13;
This result cannot be explained by differences in the extent of external&#13;
shocks, market size, incomes per head, or the composition of exports (the share of&#13;
manufactured goods in merchandise exports and the commodity concentration of exports).&#13;
Thus, in a cross-section analysis, none of these variables has been found to be&#13;
significantly correlated with reliance on export promotion in response to external&#13;
shocks.&#13;
At the same time, there is a positive correlation between the extent of&#13;
reliance on export promotion and the rate of growth of GNP for the NICs and for the&#13;
LDCs, taken separately. The Spearman ranlk correlation coefficients were 0.59 and&#13;
0.66, respectively, in these two cases, statistically significant at the 5 percent&#13;
level. In contrast, reliance on import substitution and rates of economic growth&#13;
were negatively correlated in the case of the LDCs, with a Spearman rank correlation&#13;

coefficient of -0.54 (statistically significant at the 5 percent level), whereas no&#13;
correlation was shown for the NICs. 1/&#13;
Factors Affecting Growth Performance&#13;
Outward-oriented economies had a more favorable growth experience after&#13;
1973, even though they experienced substantially larger external shocks than did&#13;
economies characterized by inward orientation. In the 1974-78 period, the balance-&#13;
of-payments effects of these shocks averaged 7.5 percent of GNP in the first case&#13;
and 3.9 percent in the second. Various considerations may explain these results.&#13;
Under an outward-oriented strategy, imports include goods competing with&#13;
domestic production and extend from raw materials to final consumer goods. In&#13;
contrast, economies pursuing inward-oriented strategies generally preclude imports&#13;
competing with domestic production and limit imports to material inputs and&#13;
machinery. Accordingly, there is greater latitude to reduce imports in response to&#13;
external shocks under an outward-oriented than under an inward-oriented strategy,&#13;
and the loss of production due to the decline in the capacity to import tends to be&#13;
larger in the latter case than in the former. This observation is supported by an&#13;
analysis of the effects of external shocks in archetypes of alternative development&#13;
strategies in a general equilibrium framework. 2/&#13;
Furthermore, the flexibility of the economy is greater under an outward-&#13;
oriented than under an inward-oriented strategy. Under outward orientation, firms&#13;
have been exposed to competition in world markets and have acquired experience in&#13;
changing their product composition in response to shifts in foreign demand. Under&#13;
inward orientation, however, there is generally limited competition in the confines&#13;

experiencing unfavorable external shocks.&#13;

of the narrow domestic market, and firms have little of the inducement to&#13;
innovate that is necessary under outward orientation to meet competition from&#13;
abroad.&#13;
Exporting also permits exploiting economies of scale, which reduce&#13;
costs in production for both foreign and domestic markets, as noted above.&#13;
Finally, existing resources and increments in resources are allocated more&#13;
efficiently under an outward-oriented than under an inward-orientd development&#13;
strategy. 1/ In fact, with increased protection in response to external shocks,&#13;
the efficiency of resource allocation has deteriorated in several cases where&#13;
inward-oriented policies were applied with greater vigor after 1973.&#13;
Efficiency differences are reflected in incremental capital-output&#13;
ratios that remained at relatively low levels in outward-oriented economies but&#13;
showed substantial increases in economies characterized by inward orientation.&#13;
Between 1963-73 and 1973-79, these ratios rose from 3.0 to 3.4 in outward-oriented&#13;
NICs and from 3.1 to 4.6 in inward-oriented NICs. In turn, incremental capital-&#13;
output ratios declined from 3.2 to 3.1 in outward-oriented LDCs and increased&#13;
from 5.1 to 5.2 in inward-oriented LDCs.&#13;
Savings performance was also more favorable under outward orientation&#13;
than under inward orientation. Among the NICs, average domestic savings ratios&#13;
increased from 16.9 percent in 1963-73 to 23.5 percent in 1973-79 in outward-&#13;
oriented economies, whereas practically no change (from 20.3 percent to 20.7&#13;
percent) occurred in inward-oriented economies. And although inward- and outward-&#13;
oriented LDCs experienced changes of similar magnitude -- from 20.3 percent to 22.4&#13;
percent in the first case and from 16.6 percent to 18.9 percent in the second --&#13;
1/  Apart from the existence of an anti-export bias, this result is due to&#13;
distortions in the form of the high dispersion of incentives under an inward-&#13;
oriented strategy. See Bela Balassa and others, Development Strategies in&#13;
Semi-Industrial Economies (Baltimore, Md.: The Johns Hopkins University Press,&#13;
forthcoming), chapter 2.&#13;

domestic savings ratios remained higher in countries characterized by outward&#13;
orientation.&#13;
Various factors contributed to these results. To begin with, there is&#13;
evidence that a larger than average proportion of incomes derived from exports is&#13;
saved. 1/ Also, with marginal savings ratios exceeding the average, higher GNP&#13;
growth rates raised the average savings ratios in outward-oriented economies.&#13;
Finally, interest rate policies and investment incentives were generally more&#13;
conducive to savings in economies applying an outward-oriented strategy than in&#13;
economies with inward orientation.&#13;
Among countries characterized by internal shocks, incremental capital-&#13;
output ratios rose from 3.4 to 6.1 in NICs and from 3.7 to 10.1 in LDCs between&#13;
1963-73 and 1973-79. In turn, domestic savings ratios rose from 19.5 percent to&#13;
22.9 percent in the first group and declined from 18.3 percent to 13.7 percent in&#13;
the second. These results indicate the adverse effects of internal shocks on the&#13;
efficiency of resource use and on savings; the exception is the NICs, where&#13;
increased savings derived from oil earnings in Mexico and from workers remit-&#13;
tances in Turkey influenced the outcome to a considerable extent.&#13;
Incremental capital-output ratios increased more than the average, from&#13;
2.1 in 1963-73 to 3.7 in 1973-79, in economies experiencing favorable external&#13;
shocks, and this largely reflects inefficiencies in the allocation of new invest-&#13;
ment funds. However, these economies utilized increases in their foreign exchange&#13;
receipts to raise domestic savings ratios from 13.8 percent to 26.0 percent during&#13;
the period.&#13;

The implications of the observed differences in incremental capital-&#13;
output ratios (I/AY) and savings ratios (S/Y) on the rate of economic growth (y)&#13;
are indicated by the results of regression analysis for the period 1973-79. The&#13;
relation, however, is not wholly undirectional, inasmuch as changes in economic&#13;
growth rates due to external causes will affect incremental capital-output ratios,&#13;
and domestic savings ratios, too, may be influenced by the rate of economic growth:&#13;
2&#13;
y = 2.97  +  0.54AY/I  +  0.20 S/Y  +  0.20 F/Y;   R  =  0.86.&#13;
(2.50)   (9.53)        (4.47)        (3.25)&#13;
As shown in the equation, rates of economic growth are also affected by the inflow&#13;
of external capital (F). But foreign borrowing also raises debt service charges&#13;
that will limit future growth unless the proceeds are productively used, in the&#13;
sense that they are invested at economic rates of return at least equal to the real&#13;
rate of interest paid on loans.&#13;
In the 1973-79 period, there was a negative correlation between the debt&#13;
service ratio and the GNP growth rate, with a Spearman rank correlation coefficient&#13;
of -0.35 (statistically significant at the 10 percent level). This result points&#13;
to the conclusion that increases in debt service charges eventually constrained&#13;
growth in cases where reliance was based on foreign borrowing in response to&#13;
external shocks.&#13;
V. Conclusions&#13;
The findings of this study indicate the advantages of outward&#13;
orientation in coping with external shocks. Outward-oriented economies suffered&#13;
greater external shocks than did economies characterized by inward orientation but&#13;
were nevertheless more successful in overcoming the effects of these shocks. Apart&#13;
from export expansion, economies pursuing an outward-oriented development strategy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
also experienced more import substitution than did inward-oriented economies.&#13;
Furthermore, after a temporary decline, their economic growth accelerated,&#13;
whereas growth rates fell in economies following an inward-oriented develop-&#13;
ment strategy.&#13;
Differences in growth rates largely reflect differences in&#13;
incremental capital-output ratios and in domestic savings ratios. Higher&#13;
efficiency in the allocation of existing resources and of increments in&#13;
resources, together with the exploitation of economies of scale, permitted&#13;
maintaining incremental capital-output ratios at low levels in outward-&#13;
oriented economies. The former group was also more successful in generating&#13;
domestic savings through the establishment of realistic interest rates and&#13;
investment incentives.&#13;
The use of domestic adjustment policies further permitted minimizing&#13;
increases in debt service charges in economies pursuing an outward-oriented&#13;
strategy. In turn, debt service charges increased substantially in economies&#13;
following inward-oriented policies because these economies relied to a con-&#13;
siderable extent on foreign borrowing to cushion the effects of external&#13;
shock.&#13;
These conclusions have obvious implications for policies that&#13;
may be followed in response to the second oil shock. They indicate the need&#13;
for domestic adjustment that would require, among other things, establishing&#13;
realistic exchange rates, avoiding a bias against exports, and providing&#13;
incentives for savings and investment. In this way, it may be ensured that&#13;
adjustment would occur through increases in output rather than through&#13;
reductions in expenditures.&#13;

            Adjustment to external shocks in developing economies
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            It is shown that newly industrializing
            economies (NICs) responded to adverse external shocks
            through domestic adjustment policies in the form of export
            promotion, import substitution, and a temporary slowdown in
            the rate of economic growth, whereas LDCs placed reliance
            largely on foreign borrowing. At the same time, within both
            the NIC and the LDC groups, outward-oriented economies made
            more successful domestic adjustment through increases in
            export shares and import substitution than inward-oriented
            economies. Correspondingly, after an initial slowdown,
            economic growth accelerated in the first group, whereas the
            opposite result is observed in the second. The results are
            confirmed by a cross-section investigation of the
            twenty-four developing economies that suffered adverse
            external shocks in the period 1974-1978. The observed
            difference in rates of economic growth are explained by the
            fact that outward-oriented economies had lower incremental
            capital-output ratios and higher savings ratios than
            inward-oriented economies. In turn, in developing economies
            benefitting from favorable external shocks, ambitious
            investment programs gave rise to high incremental
            capital-output ratios that largely offset increases in their
            savings ratios.
