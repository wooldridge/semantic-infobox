Background and Objectives&#13;
&#13;
This note is dedicated to laying out a set of principles that a technical working group of IFIs1&#13;
agreed should be applied to GHG assessment of their interventions in the transport sector.&#13;
&#13;
It is drafted as a sector-specific follow-up to the IFI Framework for Harmonized approach to&#13;
GHG Accounting2.&#13;
&#13;
Definition of transport projects&#13;
&#13;
Transport projects include any type of projects involving the provision of services to help the&#13;
movement of goods and passengers.&#13;
&#13;
Projects considered fall in one or several of the following categories:&#13;
&#13;
    -   Links - e.g.:&#13;
            o Roads&#13;
            o Public transport networks&#13;
            o Railways&#13;
            o Waterways&#13;
    -   Nodes - e.g.:&#13;
            o Ports&#13;
            o Airports&#13;
    -   Equipment - e.g.:&#13;
            o Freight and logistics&#13;
            o Vehicle acquisition, retrofit and renewal&#13;
    -   Non-physical interventions impacting the transport sector such as Policy and operational&#13;
        interventions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Agreed Principles for GHG assessment&#13;
&#13;
    1. Scope of GHG calculations: The majority of GHG emissions for the transport sector&#13;
       arise from vehicles whose movements occur on or due to the infrastructure. This means&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
  AFD, AfDB, ADB, EBRD, EIB, GEF, GIB, IDB, NIB, IFC, and the World Bank with support from the UNFCCC; to be&#13;
widened to include more IFIs as work progresses. This note will be reviewed and updated periodically by the IFIs.&#13;
2&#13;
  See â&#128;&#156;International Financial Institution Framework for a Harmonized Approach to Greenhouse Gas Accounting,&#13;
Oct .2015â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                    1&#13;
&amp;#12;        that this type of Scope 33 emissions relating to use of the infrastructure must be a primary&#13;
        consideration for GHG assessment of transport projects. Other scope 3 emissions that&#13;
        relate to the construction of the transport infrastructure may be included in the analysis&#13;
        for certain types of transport sector projects where such emissions are known to&#13;
        constitute a large part of total emissions4.&#13;
&#13;
    2. CO2 comprises the majority of transport GHG emissions. Unless there are reasons to&#13;
       believe that other GHGs are significantly affected by the project (e.g. use of bio-methane&#13;
       as the transport fuel, N2O), the assessment should focus on CO2 emissions.&#13;
&#13;
    3. Demand analysis:&#13;
&#13;
             a. Whenever scope 3 is considered, GHG assessment should be derived from a&#13;
                cross-modal 5 demand analysis on how transport policies and projects induce&#13;
                changes in transport demands, fossil fuel use, and GHG emissions. This analysis&#13;
                should take account of the main drivers of user behaviour, in particular income,&#13;
                monetary travel cost, and travel time.&#13;
&#13;
             b. Boundary for scope 3 GHG analysis: material changes in demand determined by&#13;
                the cross modal demand analysis will inform the definition of boundaries for the&#13;
                GHG analysis.&#13;
&#13;
             c. The distinction between induced and diverted traffic is essential for GHG&#13;
                analysis.&#13;
&#13;
    4. The complexity of traffic modelling will vary with the project circumstances. The quality&#13;
       and robustness of traffic forecasts will largely determine the validity of the GHG&#13;
       assessment. Therefore, IFIs should take care that traffic modelling used to inform GHG&#13;
       assessment is defensible and robust.&#13;
&#13;
    5. Alignment with economic or financial analysis, assessment period: Economic or&#13;
       financial analysis and GHG assessment should have consistent assumptions regarding&#13;
       analysesâ&#128;&#153; boundaries, demand scenarios and impacts, and assessment period.&#13;
&#13;
    6. Representative year:&#13;
&#13;
        A representative value for annual GHG emissions will be derived from an average of&#13;
        emissions over the assessment period.&#13;
&#13;
3&#13;
  See â&#128;&#156;International Financial Institution Framework for a Harmonized Approach to Greenhouse Gas Accounting,&#13;
Oct .2015â&#128;&#157;&#13;
4&#13;
  Emissions related to energy carriers, e.g. construction of infrastructure dedicated to the provision of new fuel&#13;
upstream of projects , can be also significant in some instances ; while the principle of their systematic inclusion in&#13;
the scope of emissions calculation would be difficult to implement, project ad-hoc approaches may be developed&#13;
by IFIs on this matter&#13;
5&#13;
  Where necessary&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                      2&#13;
&amp;#12;7. Basic construct of transport GHG emissions:&#13;
&#13;
   Transport GHG emissions are calculated as a product of level of Activity, modal&#13;
   Structure, Intensity of fuel use and Fuel carbon content (ASIF in short -please refer to&#13;
   Appendix 1 for illustration-), whereby:&#13;
&#13;
        a. Activity reflects demand expressed in passenger kilometres or ton kilometres;&#13;
        b. Structure reflects the share of that demand broken down by mode;&#13;
        c. Intensity is the fuel consumption of the considered mode (depending notably on&#13;
           load factors); and&#13;
        d. Fuel is the GHG emissions per unit of fuel.&#13;
&#13;
   The forecasts in relation to Activity and modal Structure are addressed in principles under&#13;
   paragraphs 3 to 6 above.&#13;
&#13;
8. Factors that inform an appropriate Intensity level should be matched to relevant local&#13;
   context, and may include:&#13;
&#13;
          . Vehicle characteristics;&#13;
          . Speed (potentially affected by congestion and safety considerations)&#13;
          . Vehicle loading;&#13;
          . Driving cycles; and&#13;
          . Driver behaviour.&#13;
  Where project-specific data on Intensity and Fuel carbon content -to be used as a priority&#13;
  where possible- are not available, IFIs should rely on authoritative sources, for example&#13;
  UNFCCC.&#13;
&#13;
9. Choice of specific tools and methodologies:&#13;
&#13;
The choice of specific assessment tool and/or methodology should be left to the discretion of&#13;
each IFI, as long as the tool and/or methodology adheres to the basic principles laid out in&#13;
this document.&#13;
&#13;
10. Baseline for calculation of net emissions:&#13;
&#13;
The baseline for the assessment of the net GHG footprint will refer to a situation when the&#13;
project is not implemented. In most cases, this base line corresponds to a situation without&#13;
an alternative new project, while trend investments to ensure the integrity of existing&#13;
infrastructure and cater for demand, if any, would be included.&#13;
&#13;
The baseline will in all cases be dynamic regarding the demand and the parameters&#13;
impacting it. In any case, a GHG calculation baseline entailing consistency with the economic&#13;
analysis is to be adopted, and the emissions associated to it should follow the same&#13;
calculation principles as those adopted for â&#128;&#156;with-projectâ&#128;&#157; emissions.&#13;
&#13;
For grid connected projects, the grid emission factor is to be calculated according to the IFI&#13;
Approach to GHG Assessment in Renewable Energy Sector.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                            3&#13;
&amp;#12;      Conservatism in terms of assumptions implying emissions reductions within the net GHG&#13;
      emission calculation is an overarching general principle.&#13;
&#13;
Information recording and disclosure principles, and continuation of harmonisation&#13;
efforts:&#13;
&#13;
Where individual project level emissions forecasts are made public, the essential information&#13;
and assumptions relating to the calculation should be available along with the forecasts, inter&#13;
alia: sources of emissions; physical boundaries; effect of induced traffic; length of assessment&#13;
period; source of data if not project specific.&#13;
&#13;
The IFI working group commits to continue its harmonisation efforts regarding the GHG&#13;
assessment of transport projects, in coordination with the MDB Working group on sustainable&#13;
transport. This concerns notably the sharing of experience relating to demand scenario&#13;
analyses carried out by the IFIs in the framework of transport projects, specific topics 6 and&#13;
mutual comparison and enrichment of databases with regard to aggregated emissions factors in&#13;
particular.&#13;
