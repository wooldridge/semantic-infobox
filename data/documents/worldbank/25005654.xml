THE ICSID CASELOAD â&#128;&#147;&#13;
     STATISTICS&#13;
    (ISSUE 2015-2)&#13;
&amp;#12;            The ICSID Caseload â&#128;&#147; Statistics&#13;
                                                (Issue 2015-2)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This issue of the ICSID Caseload â&#128;&#147; Statistics updates the profile of the ICSID caseload, historically&#13;
and for the Centreâ&#128;&#153;s Fiscal Year 2015 (FY2015). It is based on cases registered or administered by&#13;
ICSID as of June 30, 2015.&#13;
&#13;
As in the previous issues, this document illustrates: the number of cases registered under the&#13;
ICSID Convention and Additional Facility Rules; the number of other cases administered by the&#13;
ICSID Secretariat; the basis of consent to ICSID jurisdiction invoked in registered arbitration and&#13;
conciliation cases; the geographic distribution of ICSID cases by the State party to the dispute,&#13;
and the economic sectors involved in ICSID disputes. It also contains data on outcomes in ICSID&#13;
arbitration and conciliation proceedings, including further information on disputes decided by&#13;
arbitral tribunals, data on discontinued ICSID arbitration proceedings, and outcomes to date in&#13;
annulment proceedings under the ICSID Convention. The nationalities and geographic origins of&#13;
arbitrators, conciliators and ad hoc committee members appointed in ICSID cases are also&#13;
featured.&#13;
&#13;
The Secretariat will continue to publish the ICSID Caseload â&#128;&#147; Statistics on a bi-annual basis, and&#13;
welcomes any comments or suggestions by email at ICSIDsecretariat@worldbank.org.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
      The ICSID Secretariat offers various levels of administrative and organizational support for non-ICSID dispute&#13;
      settlement in State-State or investor-State proceedings. Among the State-State cases administered in the&#13;
      past decade are the Southern Bluefin Tuna case (Australia and New Zealand v. Japan), an expert&#13;
      determination proceeding under the Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, and an arbitration under the Softwood&#13;
      Lumber Agreement of 2006 (United States v. Canada).&#13;
&#13;
      The Centre also frequently provides administrative assistance to investor-State arbitrations under the&#13;
      UNCITRAL Rules or other ad hoc dispute settlement provisions. The Centreâ&#128;&#153;s services in these proceedings&#13;
      range from support with the organization of hearings to administrative services comparable to those&#13;
      provided in ICSID cases. The Secretariat also acts as appointing authority, and decides proposals for&#13;
      disqualification of arbitrators, upon request. In addition to administering UNCITRAL arbitrations, ICSID has&#13;
      also assisted with the organization of hearings in arbitration proceedings conducted under the auspices of&#13;
      the ICC, LCIA, PCA, and other institutions.&#13;
