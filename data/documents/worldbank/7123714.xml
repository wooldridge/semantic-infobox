            Self-dealing : sneaking corporate value
            through the back door
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Self-dealing, prevalent in emerging
            markets, often harms minority shareholders. The
            related-party transaction is one common technique,
            especially in markets with weak law enforcement. Beyond
            self-dealing, other methods of expropriation, such as
            insider trading and dilution of share value, can also harm
            minorities. Countries can use several tactics to combat
            self-dealing, including improving disclosure, strengthening
            regulatory enforcement, and increasing public awareness of
            good governance and investor rights. While not always
            successful, these measures often go a long way toward
            protecting minority investors.
