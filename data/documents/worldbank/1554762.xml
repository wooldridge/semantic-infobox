FOREWORD&#13;
This paper is one in a special series of World Bank Staff&#13;
Working Papers on population change and development. Prepared as&#13;
background papers for the World Development Report 1984, they provide&#13;
more detailed treatment and documentation of the issues dealt with in&#13;
Part II of the Report. The papers cover a range of topics, including&#13;
the effects of fertility and mortality, the links between population&#13;
growth and internal and international migration, and the management,&#13;
financing, and effectiveness of family planning programs. They include&#13;
several country and regional studies of fertility change and population&#13;
policy.&#13;
The background papers draw on a large number of published and&#13;
unpublished studies of individual researchers, on Bank policy analysis&#13;
and research, and on reports of other organizations working on popula-&#13;
tion and development programs and issues. The papers are the work of&#13;
individuals and the views and interpretations expressed in them do not&#13;
necessarily coincide with the views and interpretations of the Report&#13;
itself.&#13;
I hope these detailed studies will supplement the World&#13;
Development Report 1984 in furthering understanding of population and&#13;
development issues among students and practitioners of development.&#13;

Abstract&#13;
This analysis considers changing patterns of population&#13;
mobility in terms of shifts in productive structure and social&#13;
relations of production. It is based on the premise that migration&#13;
analysis cannot be divorced from an historical perspective, and in&#13;
particular that in many low-income regions recent changes in population&#13;
mobility have to be understood in terms of the colonial legacy and the&#13;
attempted transition to capitalist industrialization. In that context,&#13;
it concludes with a critical review of government policies designed or&#13;
expected to influence migration rates and patterns, arguing that often&#13;
the policies have effects quite contrary to those intended by their&#13;
advocates.&#13;

en la prem:isa de que el anAlisis de la migracion no puede separarse de una&#13;
perspectiva hist6rica y, en particular, que en muchas regiones de bajos&#13;

comprenderse en terminos de la herencia colonial y el intento de&#13;

concluye con un anAlisis critico de las politicas gubernamentales&#13;
destinadas a influir en las tasas y esquemas de la migraci6n, o que se&#13;

efectos muy contrarios a los que se proponian sus defensores.&#13;

1. IratroductLon&#13;
Population mobility has become one of the most pressing and con-&#13;
fusing demographic and social issues of the latter part of the twentieth&#13;
century, both a symptom of profound changes in productive structures,&#13;
and in national and international divisions of labour, and a contributing&#13;
factor to such changes.   Governments of all political hues in most&#13;
parts of the world have long come to regard population distribution as a&#13;
greater cause of long-term concern than population growth per se, as&#13;
revealed in the much-cited United Nations' surveys of government&#13;
perceptions.   This is illustrated by the 1980 survey, which showed&#13;
that in every part of the world more governments regarded the spatial&#13;
distribution of their population as a cause of concern than their fertility&#13;
levels (table 1).&#13;
Social scientists who have attempted to assess the phenomenon&#13;
have been split.  Some have regarded migration as growing at a rapid&#13;
rate in recent years, contributing to "excessive urbanisation" and the&#13;
growth of huge "mega-cities", to chronic urban-open unemployment,&#13;
worsening income inequality, ecological stress, population maldistribution&#13;
and a growing threat to the social fabric.  Others have been far less&#13;
alarmed, depicting mobility as a necessary part of economic growth,&#13;
evidence of equilibrating tendencies, a factor facilitating industrialisation,&#13;
improving income distribution, inducing technical change in agriculture,&#13;
reducing population growth and easing social tensions, mainly but not&#13;
only in those areas from which the migrants move.  Overlaying those&#13;
two admittedly extreme views are two "policy" perspectives.  There are&#13;
those who readily admit that the evidence is far from conclusive that&#13;
migration causes various adverse trends but that governments would be&#13;
advised to check migration for some social, economic or political benefit.&#13;
Conversely, there are those who admit there may be (short-term)&#13;
adverse effects but that freedom of movement is a basic human right,&#13;
1 Thus even according to the 1978 survey, the overwhelming&#13;
majority of "developing" country governments saw population distribution&#13;
as a greater source of development problems than population growth.&#13;

such that any policies to restrict it can only be justified after empirical&#13;
demonstration that the benefits outweigh the costs.  The "liberal"&#13;
position is that a person who moves chooses to do so and is doing so to&#13;
improve his welfare, so that interference with that choice reduces that&#13;
welfare.&#13;
These contrasting views have been expressed in their extreme form&#13;
to illustrate the range of opinion and the significance of the issues.&#13;
But analysis and policy prescription have scarcely been helped by&#13;
several basic failings.  First of all, the extent of population mobility&#13;
has been grossly underestimated, for two main reasons.  The concepts&#13;
used to indicate population mobility have been inadequate in most&#13;
censuses and surveys, and in studies based on them, while the type&#13;
and extent of data collected on mobility have been relatively scanty and&#13;
neglected compared with that relating to other demographic phenomena.&#13;
Conceptually, there has been a persistant tendency to limit the per-&#13;
ception of population mobility to "long-term changes in residence", and&#13;
even there dilemmas have remained over whether that should be restricted&#13;
to changes in place of usual (de jure) residence or whether it should&#13;
be extended to changes in de facto residence, the latter being likely to&#13;
give much higher measures of population movement.  Typically, attention&#13;
has been concentrated on rural-urban migration and/or moves that&#13;
involve crossing a regional or state boundary.  Such practices not&#13;
only result in underestimates of mobility but are liable to give distorted&#13;
images of the underlying patterns.  Thus, to give a simple example, in&#13;
India 1971 census data based on inter-state long-term migration suggested&#13;
that male mobility greatly exceeded female; but in fact women predomi-&#13;
nated in intra-state migration, often moving for marriage but also for&#13;
other reasons.   Similarly, various studies have indicated that long-&#13;
distance, rural-urban changes in usual residence tend to be selective of&#13;
the relatively educated; however, in many countries short-distance,&#13;
intra-rural, short-term mobility is both more common than other types&#13;
and almost certainly selective of the relatively uneducated; data that&#13;

measuring population mobility, see G. Standing:  Conceptualising&#13;

reveal the one and not the other cannot in all seriousness be used to&#13;
indicate that "education increases t:he propensity to migrate, ergo rising&#13;
educational levels will lead to growing population mobility".&#13;
One might contend that planners, statisticians and researchers are&#13;
primarily interested in long-term r esidential changes, rather than other&#13;
forms of mobility, because they have the most social, economic and&#13;
demographic significance.  That is by no means proven, and is unlikely&#13;
to be, for other forms of mobility may have similar or quite different&#13;
implications.  That leads to a fundamental concern, which is that, with&#13;
the current state of knowledge, recommended "migration policies" are&#13;
likely to be ill-conceived, poorly implemented or inadequately monitored.&#13;
Briefly, there are three main reasons for that.  First, with the&#13;
shortcomings of most available data, policies geared to one sort of&#13;
mobility may be implemented when another form of migration is actually&#13;
far more widespread.    Second, the methodologies for analysing the&#13;
efficacy of policies - even for fully identifying the objectives and the&#13;
direct and incdirect effects to be considered - are scarcely developed.&#13;
Third, the two theoretical models that dominate the extensive&#13;
literature on migration are oversimplifications of a complex reality,&#13;
failing to link migration to social, demographic and economic change,&#13;
often so cdivorced from historical reality that they help conceal more&#13;
than they reveal.2  The two dominant models are somewhat related but&#13;
reflect different levels of abstraction.  The neo-classical "human capital"&#13;
and "expected income" model - with its numerous slight variants -&#13;
focuses on individual potential migrrants, and trivialises the phenomenon&#13;
by reaching such startling conclusions as that, holding much else&#13;
1  For example, if policy-makers were concerned with the growth&#13;
of cities and perceived the problem as rural emigration the-y might&#13;
introduce controls or incentives to restrict rural-urban migrration.&#13;
However, if the actual situation consisted of step-migration from smaller&#13;
towns to the cities the policy could be a costly failure and even counter-&#13;
productive, perhaps by making escape from rural poverty more desirable.&#13;
2  An alternative perspective is reiterated later, but of course&#13;
there have been various approacies by geographers, sociologists and&#13;
othe socia] sciences.  For an exhaustive and exhausting compendium of&#13;
"psycho-analytical" analyses of rnigration behaviour, see G .F. de Jong&#13;
and R.W. Gardner (eds.): Migration decision making: Multidisciplinary&#13;
approaches to microlevel studies in developed countries  (New  York,&#13;
Pergamon Press, 1981).&#13;

constant, people will migrate if they expect to do better than they&#13;
probably would if they did not move.   One should not dismiss the&#13;
usefulness of neo-classical-type models, but should be wary about&#13;
hinging much of the explanation of mobility on their abstract elegance,&#13;
especially as they have stark policy implications.  The second can be&#13;
termed the dualistic model, which concentrates on sectoral flows, typically&#13;
derived from work by Lewis, Ranis and Fei and their followers.  In&#13;
this schema, one typically finds dichotomies that are at best contrived&#13;
abstractions - "modern" vs. "traditional', "formal' vs. "informal",&#13;
"subsistence" vs. "non-subsistence" sectors, and the like.  There has&#13;
tended to be some convergence between the human capital and dualistic&#13;
models, with the postulation of somewhat more disaggregated sectors&#13;
that focus on individual behaviour in ways that the early dualistic&#13;
models did not entertain.  Yet it is interesting that the earlier dualistic&#13;
framework essentially saw migration as an equilibrating phenomenon,&#13;
something to be encouraged as a means of achieving a transition to&#13;
industrial growth, whereas the later human-capital and opportunity-&#13;
income models tended to regard migration as a cause of concern - a&#13;
"bad thing" - for which remedies had to be found.  Their changing&#13;
relative dominance in the economic literature has almost certainly mirrored&#13;
changes in the pattern of mobility in many industrialising countries,&#13;
which neither model adequately explained.  But it is sterile to merely&#13;
point to the inadequacies of the human capital and dualistic models&#13;
without at least presenting the nucleus of an alternative approach.&#13;
Such an alternative should surely treat population growth, productive&#13;
relations and migration policies as endogenous in explaining patterns of&#13;
mobility and immobility.&#13;
1 One sizmple policy message that has been deduced from a widely-&#13;
known model of this genre is that the migration elasticity of urban&#13;
wages is greater than the corresponding elasticity of the urban unem-&#13;
ployment rate, so that cutting urban wages would be an effective means&#13;
of reducing rural-urban migration and urban unemployment.&#13;

:II. Pre-colonial and Pre-capitalist Mobility Patterns&#13;
The human species is not a migratory one.   But in rudimentary&#13;
societies mobility has bee:ni a way of survival - the first mode of&#13;
existence, as Marx called it.  TID be able to trace the inter-relationships&#13;
between social relations, population growth and territorial mobility, it is&#13;
essential to identify "early" forms of mobility, in part because many&#13;
r emain highly relevant in the world and in part because socio-economic&#13;
change can be expected to have different effects on different forms of&#13;
population mobility.  Schematically, territorial mobility in pre-capitalist&#13;
eras can be split into ecological migration, immobilisation and social&#13;
migration.  The first has been lound throughout history and persists&#13;
today in certain undeveloped parts of the world.  Essentially, it reflects&#13;
an imbalance between natural resources and population, given available&#13;
technology.   Survival in such circumstances has been best pursued&#13;
through mobility, as a way of life and of subsistence.  One should&#13;
further distinguish between collective and individualistic forms of&#13;
ecological trigration, as surnmarised in figure 1.&#13;
There are four main forms of collective mobility.  The first is&#13;
Inomadic movement - a terrn derived from the Greek "to pasture' - and&#13;
consists of herders who move over an extensive territory seasonally and&#13;
cyclically, as dictated by climate and local resources.  These tend to&#13;
be omitted from discussions of migration, but are possibly the closest to&#13;
the lay impression of the meaning of migration.  They remain a major&#13;
phenomenort in some parts of the world, although sedentisation has&#13;
reduced their prominence in recent years.&#13;
The second and third forms of ecological migration are hunting-and-&#13;
gathering and cultivating, both of which have been less predictable in&#13;
character than nomadic mobility, and less inclined to be circulating.&#13;
Hunters and gatherers roam in search of food, hunting and picking the&#13;
vegetation in any area through which they pass until it is nearly&#13;
exhausted, when they resume their travelling.  Cultivating migration&#13;
embraces those communities who have traditionally been forced to pursue&#13;
non-sedentary or shifting cultivalion, notably through forms of "slash-&#13;
and-burn" cultivation.&#13;
&#13;

Finally, there have always been ecologically-induced collective&#13;
movements resulting in longer-term  settlements.  In many regions of&#13;
the world, mass resettlement migrations have occasionally taken place as&#13;
groups have moved to previously unsettled land, as occurred in Java in&#13;
the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.  It is sobering to contemplate&#13;
that about 2,000 years ago the rulers of the Chinese organised the mass&#13;
movements of more than a million people, and provided some of the&#13;
migrants with travel allowances.'&#13;
Collective movements have also occurred in response to epidemics&#13;
or famines induced by floods or droughts.   These movements have&#13;
depended on low population density, simply to allow resettlements on&#13;
such a scale.   But where local populations have relied on seasonal&#13;

rainfall, the vagaries of the weather have made their livelihood peculiarly&#13;
sensitive to crop failures, which have often impelled them to rnove.&#13;
Other forms of ecological migration have been more indivridualistic&#13;
in character, even where large nlunbers of particular communities have&#13;
participated. Throughout history, to a greater or lesser ext:ent depend-&#13;
ing on the nature of local ecology, cultivation and other productive&#13;
activity, villagers have resorted ito circulation, moving temporarily in&#13;
search of piece--work, casual labour or some other form of income-earning&#13;
activity to complement local productive activities, or indulging in what&#13;
some have described as sociological travelling - visiting kin, strengthen-&#13;
ing reciprocal ties between villages (a particularly valued mechanism&#13;
where the threat of famine, drought, floods or harvest failure has been&#13;
endemic), and so on.   Such movernent has been an integral ipart of the&#13;
lives of such communities, complernenting rather than competing with&#13;
other activities, but reflecting ecological limitations on the economic&#13;
base of village life. They contrast sharply with patterns of temporary&#13;
migration in class-structured societies, whether "feudal" or uLndergoing&#13;
partial or total transformation to capitalist production, and most strikingly&#13;
perhaps in the colonies of Central and South America, Africa and Asia.&#13;
Unlike ecological migration, immobilisation is based crucially on the&#13;
existence of social classes and exploitative relations of procluction.1&#13;
Of course, there have been many reasons for immobility, including&#13;
ignorance, :fear of the unknown and physical incapacity.  Yet there&#13;
have been pervasive forms of social control restricting mobility or&#13;
directing it which have been far more prevalent in some types of society&#13;
than in others.  Resort to surch controls has in part been a function of&#13;
population density and growth, but has fundamentally reflected the&#13;
social relations of production and distribution.&#13;
In rudimentary societies with low population densities, landlords or&#13;
other ruling elites have extracted surplus from large proportions of the&#13;
1  As a general point, it is surely an error to identify and seek&#13;
explanations for migration rather than both movement and non-movement.&#13;
If there were large income differentials between areas what should be&#13;
regarded as remarkable is not that 5 per cent migrate but that 95 per&#13;
cent do not.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
population by tight coercive controls.  The most restrictive form of&#13;
immobility has been slavery, which persists in a few low population&#13;
density areas, notably in parts of Central Africa.  Scarcely less&#13;
restrictive has been serfdom.  In feudal Europe serfs were "tied to the&#13;
soil" by legal and extra-legal regulations.  And in the eighteenth and&#13;
nineteenth centuries landlords and other ruling groups in colonial&#13;
territories in Latin America, the Caribbean, Africa and much of Asia&#13;
responded to the typically low population density by tying peasants to&#13;
small plots of land by rental obligations, often forcing them to serve&#13;
regular and protracted periods of labour service.  Again, these situ-&#13;
ations have persisted in some places late into the twentieth century;&#13;
but in many places where they were used to control mobility they have&#13;
been replaced, for reasons discussed later.&#13;
Involving less coercion but nevertheless considerable localised&#13;
pressures and sanctions have been social controls, whereby tribes,&#13;
kinship groups and villages of cultivators have evolved webs of recipro-&#13;
cal obligations based on kinship or lineage relations dictating the&#13;
communal division of labour and the extent and form of movement.  It&#13;
is the breakdown of such reciprocities in communities under stress that&#13;
has contributed to the growth of some forms of territorial mobility.&#13;
A related form of restriction on mobility in "pre-capitalist" com-&#13;
munities is the practice of patronage, used to considerable effect by&#13;
colornal landowners, but long predating colonialism.  Often this has&#13;
taken the form of paternalism, whereby peasants would place themselves&#13;
under the protection of a powerful landlord and in return provide rent,&#13;
in the form of labour, a share of the produce or cash rent.  Ccmmonly,&#13;
the patron-client relation extended to fictive kinship, as in many parts&#13;
of Latin America, whereby the landlord adopted a peasant's child or&#13;
acted as a godfather.   Typically, such peasants or their forebears&#13;
have been coerced into a state of dependent insecurity, and if trans-&#13;
gressing some local "law" have been subject to summary justice.&#13;
1 The following touches on issues discussed in more detail else-&#13;
where.   G. Standing:   "Migration and modes of exploitation:  Social&#13;
origins of immobility and mobility", in Journal of Peasant Studies, Jan.&#13;
1981, Vol. 8, No. 1, pp. 173-211.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
Nevertheless, there is much evidence to suggest that patron-client&#13;
relations have induced a passivity on the part of the oppressed, through&#13;
a sense of dependent insecurity they have fostered.&#13;
Apart from the immobility and ecological migration in pre-capitalist&#13;
societies there has also been social migration, which has been more&#13;
individualistic than collect.ive in nature.  It is of course true that&#13;
there have been many mass movements associated with local wars or&#13;
flight from a conquering force.  But perhaps of much greater signifi-&#13;
cance have been individualistic movements in what could be described as&#13;
stress migration.  In this, the role of population growth has been&#13;
twofold.   Growth of peasant farnilies has led to land fragmentation,&#13;
with descendents sharing land, often subdivided into small parcels&#13;
scattered across a village;  this in itself has reduced living standards&#13;
and land productivity, and made work on the land more onerous and&#13;
time-consurning.  In many rural areas, the contrived absence of a land&#13;
market has limited the ability of peasant communities to overcome this&#13;
tendency through land sales and consolidation.  In Malaysian kampongs,&#13;
to take an example that has persisted into the 1980s, the result has&#13;
been temporary and longer-term out-migration coupled with chronic&#13;
underutilisation of land, with the lack of drainage on one plot under-&#13;
mining the productivity of adjoining plots.&#13;
Another major impact of population growth has been through its&#13;
influence on the forms and levels of exploitation in agrarian communities.&#13;
Where landlords (or other groups controlling the means of production or&#13;
in a position to extract surplus from the peasants) have stipulated&#13;
rents and imposed local "taxes", the growth in size of peasant households&#13;
has reduced their ability to pay.  But the demographic expansion of&#13;
landlords' households has also had an impact, through increasing their&#13;
need for revenue to maintain their accustomed standard of living.&#13;
There have, of course, been other factors raising that need for revenue&#13;
and reducing the peasants' ability to pay accustomed rents.  But a&#13;
common result has been rising rents with constant or declining peasant&#13;
incomes, forcing some to migrate temporarily in search of additional&#13;
income or a cash income.   Historians can point to many instances in&#13;
which lancdlords subjected peasants to such high rents that many of&#13;
them fled, as was often t'he case in parts of Thailand and Viet Nam,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
where overexploited peasants went into the jungle to survive as squatters&#13;
or to other areas where they could obtain land.   In many places, a&#13;
related tendency has been for local or national ruling elites to impose&#13;
local taxes that have grown excessive for similar reasons, leading to&#13;
mass flight.   Often, stress migration has been a mass movement, but&#13;
it has been individualistic in character.&#13;
A quite different form of individualistic migration long predating&#13;
the penetration of capitalist relations of production is trade migration.&#13;
Merchants have commonly come from ethnic or religious minorities and&#13;
have been instrumental in setting up new ports or market towns, gather-&#13;
ing round them a retinue of servants, workers and others supplying&#13;
them with goods, so that merchants have been pioneer migrants drawing&#13;
residents from other areas because of the incomes they were generating.3&#13;
Somewhat related has been transilient migration, that is a life of regular&#13;
movement in response to localised economic fluctuations, consisting&#13;
primarily of itinerant traders and migratory labourers who have been a&#13;
large category of populations throughout history.&#13;
Another traditional, persisting form of social migration is what can&#13;
be called life-cycle stage migration. In many parts of the world,&#13;
youths -mostly men - would be expected to leave their villages for a&#13;
period to gain experience, skills and petty spoils.  As a rite de&#13;
passage, this has been a necessary part of gaining adulthood and a&#13;
means of ensuring a man social status in the village on his return.&#13;
Such temporary migration has commonly acted as a safety valve for the&#13;
village social structure, depriving the village of potentially disruptive&#13;
younger elements who might otherwise be inclined to challenge the&#13;
traditional authority structure and oppose the rule or status of the&#13;

Scott: The moral economy of the peasant (New Haven, Yale University&#13;
Press, 1976).&#13;
2 A celebrated case was in Egypt under the Cortes in the sixteenth&#13;
century, when tax rises were restricted by the tendency for peasants&#13;
to flee if they went beyond levels perceived to be tolerable.&#13;
3 An early typology of migrants distinguished between "innovative"&#13;
and "conservative" migrants.  W. Petersen:   "A general typology of&#13;
migration", in American Sociological Review, June 1958, Vol. 23, No. 2,&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
"elders'.  More generally, safety-valve migration has been a means of&#13;
preserving social relations of production under stress.  It has often&#13;
reflected population pressu re on resources, a growing inability to meet&#13;
-the demands of landlords, village elders or other groups, or a growing&#13;
:nability to maintain land quality through proper use of fallow periods,&#13;
avoidance of excessive interplanting, etc.  As such, it has been a&#13;
ineans of reduc:ing household "underemployment" and enabling ismallholders&#13;
to pay rent or taxes.1   Stress migration may have benefited such&#13;
hxouseholds, butL typically it has irLnrolved a sorry process.  And although&#13;
the image is of young men being involved, some of the worst forms of&#13;
such migration have involved young women.   In India, for example,&#13;
chronic indebtedness in rural areas has induced families to take the&#13;
desperate step of sending wives and daughters to towns to earii uinoney&#13;
through prostitution to help them retain land or paltry assetis.2  In&#13;
Thailand, village girls have long flocked to Bangkok to work for a few&#13;
months or years as masseuses and prostitutes to help maintain rural&#13;
households.3   Elsewhere, the labour migration pattern has been more&#13;
integrated into the rural ec:onamy.  Thus, to give just one example, in&#13;
central Peru short-term migration has helped maintain rural smallholder&#13;
production by strengthening reciprocal labour obligations between&#13;
geographically split "household confederations". 4&#13;
The st:abilising role of safety-valve migration, as well as its extent,&#13;
should not be cverlooked.  However, it has rarely arrested the process&#13;
that induces it.  Not only are return-migrants less likely to accept&#13;
traditional forms of oppression, control and even life styles (a point to&#13;
which we shall return), but there has been a pervasive tendency for&#13;
The notion of "householdn is not always appropriate, for in&#13;
many peasant communities the kin-communal relations of production&#13;
involve reciprocities that extend well beyond any concept of household.&#13;

sbort-term migration geared to the needs of the rural economy to give&#13;
way to migration patterns geared to the needs of "receiving" areas,&#13;
often implying a reduction in the seasonal character of population&#13;
mobility.1  Those changes in themselves have reduced labour avail-&#13;
ability at critical seasonal periods, tending to lead to a stagnation or&#13;
deterioration of smallholder agriculture.  Moreover, by being selective&#13;
of young adults with potentially relatively high productivity in agricul-&#13;
tural work, even short-term migration has adversely affected rural&#13;
production by leaving aged rural labour forces and households in which&#13;
women and children have had to assume a much greater work burden.2&#13;
It certainly cannot be presumed that safety-valve migration has typically&#13;
resulted in an improvement in rural living standards.  Rather the&#13;
reverse, for it has commonly undermined the viability of reciprocal&#13;
arrangements, such as communal and exchange labour, which have been&#13;
a necessary basis for pre-capitalist productive relations.&#13;
In sum, population mobility in areas characterised by peasant,&#13;
tribal or other pre-capitalist forms of production and distribution should&#13;
not be underestimated, either in its scale or in its impact or "function".3&#13;
There have been collective, mass and individual streams of migration,&#13;
some of which have been circular and short-term in character, some a&#13;
matter of ecological or social adaptation involving long-term resettlement.&#13;

It is, to reiterate, partly because of gross inadequacy of&#13;
migration concepts and the type of data that reflect them that "tra-&#13;
ditional" forms of population mobility have been underestimated.  This&#13;
has tended to lead to expectation of unilinear developments; thus&#13;

steady growth of "personal mobility" with progressive modernisation.&#13;

foundly changed with the penetration of capitalist forms and social&#13;
relations of production, first with the impact of colonialism anel in more&#13;
recent years with the spread of indigenous agro-export and manufac-&#13;
turing industrialisation.&#13;
III. Colonialism: Its Legacy for Mobility&#13;
Although it cannot be presumed that patterns of population mobility&#13;
that occurred in countries that have industrialised will be reproduced in&#13;
countries undergoing industrialisation, it would also be a mistake to&#13;
think that many similar patterns would not emerge there.  History does&#13;
have lessons and should not be ignored.   In that regard, both the.&#13;
experience of European transitions to industrial capitalism and the&#13;
legacy of colonialism are instructiNre for understanding current patterns&#13;
of population mobiLity in industrialising countries.&#13;
A few features of the European transition deserve to be kept in&#13;
mind.    Capitalist centres of expansion tended to emerge outside old&#13;
established urban centres in newly urbanising areas, where an influx of&#13;
wage labour ers was required.  Older towns tended to contain barriers&#13;
to expansion, notably craft guilds and their like, which had carefully&#13;
limited the number of workers with productive skills and prevented&#13;
extensions in the detailed division of labour.  The protection afforded&#13;
to strategic groups of skilled workers in the older towns encouraged&#13;
entrepreneurs to expand elsewlhere, and made it likely that enterprises&#13;
]Located elsewhere would be those that would flourish.&#13;
Wherever located, the need for low-cost labour led employers and&#13;
their representatives to encourage an increase in population mobility.&#13;
In practice, this meant efforts to secure a "free" labour force in the&#13;
classic double sense of being free of the means of production and free&#13;
to hire themselves out as wage wcrkers, wherever they were required&#13;
at wages largely dictated by the employers.  In effect, those "demand-&#13;
ing" labour took steps to increase the "supply" of wage labour, which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
included state policies to undermine social relations in agriculture and&#13;
the various practices that had been preserved by urban guilds and&#13;
burghers.   Similar reactions have characterised recent transitions in&#13;
industrialising countries, as will be discussed later.&#13;
In Western Europe, population growth contributed to satisfying the&#13;
employers' need for cheap migrant labour.  But the State played a&#13;
very active part in stimulating rural out-migration.  In Britain, mass&#13;
expulsions came with the legislated enclosure of much of the countryside,&#13;
while changes in the system of poor relief - crystallised in the 1834&#13;
Poor Law - drove many landless, rural unemployed to migrate to the&#13;
new centres of industry.  This was a time when a surplus population&#13;
was needed - to provide an adequate supply of exploitable labour, to -&#13;
provide downward pressure on wages and to be a disciplining element in&#13;
the labour force.  Only later, when technological improvements had&#13;
helped create a more stagnant (urban) pool of surplus labourers, did&#13;
another form of population mobility begin in earnest.  During the&#13;
nineteenth century, growing numbers of impoverished workers, including&#13;
many craftsmen and skilled workers displaced by advances in the tech-&#13;
nical division of labour, fled from Europe, flocking to the USA as well&#13;
as to the numerous colonies of the European powers.  Between 1800&#13;
and 1914 the net emigration from Europe was about 50 million, and as&#13;
many returned the gross figure may have been something like 65 million.&#13;
The colonising process itself involved colonies specialising in&#13;
commercial exports to the neglect or active dislocation of the indigenous&#13;
economic peasants in the countries concerned, as well as the limited&#13;
growth of urban centres of industry.   In many areas, the colonial&#13;
authorities and commercially-minded immigrant settlers acquired the most&#13;
fertile land on which to grow export crops such as sugar cane, tobacco,&#13;
tea and coffee.  In some cases, they evicted smallholder cultivators, in&#13;
1  For example, the period of most intense colonial exploitation of&#13;
Latin America was marked by some de-urbanisation.  There may have&#13;
been a U-shaped curve in the ratio of urban to rural population from&#13;
the mid-eighteenth to late nineteenth century.  R.M. Morse:  "The&#13;
development of urban systems in the Americas in the nineteenth century",&#13;
in Journal of Inter-American Studies, Feb. 1975, Vol. 17, No. 1, p. 7.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 --&#13;
others thev acquired land at artificially deflated prices, and in others&#13;
they obtained land for whiLch there was no recognised title.  This led&#13;
to distress migration, as peasants were squeezed onto the more marginally&#13;
productive land, often far from the fertile plains, in the less accessible,&#13;
less fertile areas or more inhospitable highlands.&#13;
In the early phase of European colonisation, slavery involved a&#13;
heavy flow of international migrants, who often made colonial expansion&#13;
possible.  Later, indentured labour involved many hundreds of thousands&#13;
being transported, having signed away their "freedom" of movement for&#13;
at least the period of indenture.  For a long time, the colonial authonities&#13;
connived with the plantations anrc other users of those workers to&#13;
ensure they remained indentured for longer, and helped maintain the&#13;
ignorance and mentality of op pressed passivity that has continued in&#13;
many estate areas, where out-migration has remained limited despite&#13;
appalling living and working conditions.1&#13;
There were several other long-term implications of the forced&#13;
international migrations in the colonial era.  For over a century, the&#13;
slave trade and the flow of indentured labourers and contract coolie&#13;
labour had meant the mass relocation of people of diverse ethnic,&#13;
religious, cultural and economic backgrounds.  It thereby created a&#13;
host of what have been calLed plural societies, fostering raciaal stereo-&#13;
types though distinctive racial divisions of labour, and creating group-&#13;
specific distributions of populations that in turn influenced subsequent&#13;
patterns of mobility, sincie it created social divisions of labour with&#13;
barriers to entry and upward mobility for individuals from groups&#13;
traditionally excluded from specific activities.&#13;
Slavery and indentured labour gave way in part because population&#13;
growth and effective land control by settler elites produced surplus&#13;
populations - making expensive import of labour supply unnecessary -&#13;
and in part because technological advances made labour requirements on&#13;
estates and plantations mostly seasonal, so making it unnecessary to&#13;
maintain an immobilised labour force throughout the year.  But the&#13;

the State in Guyana", in P. Peek and G. Standing (eds.):   State&#13;
paolicies and migration: Studies in Latin America and the Caribbean&#13;

- 17 -&#13;
extra-economic coercion of those forms of labour persisted in many&#13;
parts of the world, often bolstered by State legislation.  Increasingly,&#13;
the coercive practices that emerged were geared to increasing labour&#13;
circulation rather than prolonged immobilisation.  Thus, many large&#13;
haciendas and other estates appointed agents to seek migrant labourers&#13;
from peasant areas, and did not press them to adopt scrupulous methods&#13;
in doing so.  A well-documented example is a group of sugar estates&#13;
in Gujarat in India, where employers have continued to rely on migrant&#13;
labourers hired by labour contractors into signing contracts to work on&#13;
the estates during the harvest, in terrible conditions, for pitifully small&#13;
wages and subject to the whims of the contractors.  In such cases,&#13;
examples of which could be cited for many countries, employers, whether&#13;
local or foreign enterprises, have kept their distance from the reality of&#13;
popuation mobility on which they conveniently rely.&#13;
A feature of such labour systems is that indebtedness has been&#13;
used to direct as well as to limit mobility.  Usury and debt bondage&#13;
have continued to be means by which landlords induce immobility in&#13;
areas still dominated by landlords.  But indebtedness has also been&#13;
used to induce migration.  In large parts of Latin America and in&#13;
parts of Asia and Africa, plantations and haciendas have often retained&#13;
only a small core of permanent employees, and when harvest time&#13;
approached have sent agents to get workers from among the peasantry&#13;
living in the highlands.  To get them, the agents have offered small&#13;
advances to peasants desperate for cash, stipulating that the debt had&#13;
to be cleared during the period of employment, the debt being deducted&#13;
from the wage.  In some cases, consumption loans have been granted&#13;
at high interest rates, with the recipients being obliged to go to the&#13;
estates to work for the means to pay off the debt; commonly, at the&#13;
end of the period of temporary labour, they would be unable to pay off&#13;
anything more than the interest and would be obliged to agree to return&#13;
when labour was next required.  One way or another, such practices&#13;
have impelled workers to migrate long distances to work in harsh&#13;

conditions, with little opportunity to rectify an inherently oppressive&#13;
labour relationship.  In the highlands of Peru, the advanced-loan&#13;
labour hiring practice has been known most appropriately as enganche,&#13;
meaning the "hook".   Such practices, with the indirect effect on wages&#13;
for other workers and their dislocative effect on peasant comimunities,&#13;
scarcely fit the simple human capital and expected-income models of&#13;
migration that have dominated the' development literature in recent&#13;
years.   Explanations of population mobility based in terms of rural&#13;
wages, wage differentials and unemployment have to be assessed in the&#13;
context that non-wage mechanisms; of control over mobility have been an&#13;
integraI part of the labour process and by no means a minor consider-&#13;
ation.&#13;
Another form of migration that colonialism almost legitimised, and&#13;
,which has persisted, is forced labour on public projects, as was common&#13;
in Mozambique and French West Africa, for example.   This typically&#13;
involved groups of peasant-labourers being required to go far from&#13;
their village to work on roads, on railway construction or on the&#13;
construction of public buil.dings.  Forced labour has also taken the&#13;
form of cointrived immobilisation, as where the authorities forced small-&#13;
holders to produce specific: cash crops for the estates, latifundios or&#13;
plantations; the actions restrictec mobility by forcing farmers to work&#13;
throughout the year to produce the export crops as well as their&#13;
subsistence! needs.&#13;
Coercive methods have been subsidiary to more general actions&#13;
influencing population mobilit, wtvhich were established by colonial&#13;
regimes and which have continued to influence population distribution&#13;
and mobility, and indeed have made the population "problem" so funda-&#13;
mental in the latter part of the twentieth century.  The estates and&#13;
mines in the colonies, and the settlers and enterprises that remained in&#13;
effective control after the formal ending of colonial rule were always&#13;
concerned with the need to secure a labour supply that was adequate,&#13;
efficient and low-cost.  I'here were always limits to the use of overtly&#13;
coercive methods of obtaining and using workers, methods which became&#13;
increasingly unacceptable to ]Local and international sentiment, even&#13;
though they often continued in modified form.  To a much greater&#13;
degree, estates, plantations and rnining interests relied on fiscal and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
land-control measures to create a mobile, low-cost labour supply.  In&#13;
many territories, the indigenous population found it increasingly hard&#13;
to acquire or retain land, much of the fertile area being in the hands&#13;
of small groups of estate owners, usually immigrants or foreign companies,&#13;
or kept idle or chronically underutilised.  Squeezed onto land that&#13;
suffered from soil erosion or exhaustion and that tended to be frag-&#13;
mented into tiny parcels through inheritance customs or deliberate&#13;
policy, smallholders had to search for wage employment to enable them&#13;
to survive.  Temporary migration - labour circulation - became a basic&#13;
survival mechanism in much of Latin America, Africa and South Asia.&#13;
And besides experiendng shrinking access to cultivable land and grow-&#13;
ing insecurity of tenure, large numbers of the rural poor were forced&#13;
into wage labour drculation through the imposition of local and national&#13;
taxes.   It typically began with the colonial "hut", "head" or other&#13;
taxes which obliged men to move to take wage labour because of the&#13;
lack of money in the smallholder communities, so that wage jobs were&#13;
the only practicable means of acquiring the cash required.  The&#13;
authorities in French, British and Portuguese colonies were most prone&#13;
to use this method, but it was also practised in Spanish and Dutch&#13;
colonies, and copied elsewhere.  It had the effect of providing a&#13;
low-cost labour supply, because individuals were paid less than a&#13;
family-supporting wage and were expected to receive part of their&#13;
subsistence from their village households.  One should not dismiss this&#13;
as merely historical material, for in many areas the post-colonial&#13;
authorities allowed practices and laws to persist.&#13;
Nowhere was migrant labour more systematically institutionalised&#13;
than in southern Africa, where the discovery of diamonds and gold in&#13;
the later years of the nineteenth century led to a desire for a large&#13;
low-cost labour force in the mines.  Even before mining became pre-&#13;
dominant, taxes were used to obtain migrant wage labour from the&#13;
natives, without even the pretence that the tax was for public expen-&#13;
diture.  In the Transvaal, a law passed in 1870 taxed Africans working&#13;
for Europeans less than those working for others.  Then, faced by a&#13;
labour shortage because Africans preferred to farm their land rather&#13;
than work for wages in dangerous and unhealthy conditions, the&#13;
Europeans forced Africans to go to the mines, notably by the device of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
Native Labour Boards and the chibaro system of temporary contract&#13;
labour.   Migrants were forced to go hundreds of miles to work in the&#13;
rnines, and found their land expropriated or their wives and dependents&#13;
unrable to maintain the crops in t]heir absence.  Other devices inten-&#13;
sified the pressure.  In Botswana, for instance, a hut tax was intro-&#13;
dluced in 1S91 to force smallholders to migrate to the gold mines in&#13;
South Africa to get cash; there and elsewhere, the threat of eviction&#13;
helped drive the men into the inhes, and indebtedness through&#13;
"advances" was also widely usied to get them there and to remain.&#13;
A:Fricans went from what are not Botswana, Lesotho, Mozambique,&#13;
Tanzania, l'ogo, Zambia and Zimbabwe.   And what is most important&#13;
from a current perspective is that once locked into a system of long-&#13;
term  circulation, African "peas,antr-ies" lost much of. their ability to&#13;
provide an adequate standard of living for themselves.  Indeed, they&#13;
became structurally impoverished b1y having to subsidise the out-migrant&#13;
labourers' su-bsistence, becaLuse wages were set so low that the migrants&#13;
had to get assistance from relaitives.  Commercial growth in the 'labour&#13;
reserve" areas became correspondingly debilitated, and household pro-&#13;
ductive uniits disintegrated.  New ones rarely took their place.1&#13;
Meanwhile, legislation prevented the African migrant workers from&#13;
settling in the areas of their temporary employment, keeping them&#13;
permanently as temporary workers, until they were dismissed, suffered&#13;
injuries or retired. The Land Acit of 1913 and the Urban Areas Act of&#13;
1923 formalised the reality - cities, mining centres and the European&#13;
farming areas were declared "swhite man's country".  Southern Africa&#13;
is the extreme example, but the links established there between labour&#13;
circulation and chronic rural underdevelopment have persisted there&#13;
into the 1980s and been found in modified form elsewhere.  It is to the&#13;
post-colonial era that we now turn,, but many of the patterns noted in&#13;
this section have continued to be highly relevant.&#13;
IV. Industrial Transitions and Modern Migrations&#13;
In recent decades, paLtterns of population mobility in low-income&#13;
countries have been changing 'but have continued to reflect the position&#13;
The academic belief in migration's tendency to be an equili-&#13;
brating mechanism is risible in the context of such realities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
of those countries in the global economic structure.  Although it would&#13;
be invalid to generalise for all the main regions of Africa, Asia and&#13;
Latin America, some major patterns and trends are worth highlighting.&#13;
One critical factor has been the reorientation of development&#13;
strategies and the undermining of traditional power groups that has&#13;
given local capital the opportunity to expand.  This reorientation was&#13;
first given a boost by the world depression in the 1930s, especially in&#13;
Latin America.  In recent years the process has again been accelerated&#13;
with the cut-back in world trade, growing indebtedness and associated&#13;
changes in terms of trade.   In both the 1930s and since 1973 (in&#13;
particular), the cut-back in earnings from primary exports to the&#13;
industrialised countries has encouraged policies of import-substitution&#13;
and export-led industrialisation, much of it involving foreign capital in&#13;
the shape of multinationals.  In many countries, there was a shift of&#13;
emphasis from  export crop production to technologically-dependent&#13;
industrial production, as well as from local staples to export crops and&#13;
livestock.  Where this happened, the uneven nature of the economic&#13;
structure became more so.   Economic surplus from primary production&#13;
was channelled into technologically-advanced production in a few urban&#13;
centres, accentuating a form of economic "dualism".  A contributing&#13;
factor and an immediate consequence was economic stagnation among&#13;
rural petty producers, putting them under strong pressure to migrate&#13;
into the cities.  This was reflected in growing landlessness, as tenants&#13;
smallholders were dispossessed of land to make way for large-scale&#13;
commercial farming, and as land fragmentation proceeded with population&#13;
growth and curtailed access to cultivable land, and as agricultural&#13;
involution made family smallholdings insufficiently large to permit even a&#13;
bare survival subsistence from  farming.  Changes in the tenns of&#13;
trade between staple food crops and export crops, between agriculture&#13;
and urban-industrial goods, and between local and imported goods, also&#13;
worsened and added pressure on the rural poor to seek alternative&#13;
livelihoods.  In more and more cases, the delicate process by which&#13;
Piecing together the evidence on changes in terms of trade is&#13;
extremely hazardous, as the FAO and World Bank have found.    From&#13;
our point of view, the primary interest is in changes in relative returns&#13;
and incomes.   Subsidies, especially through foreign aid, have tended&#13;
to flow into export crops and goods production, raising the profitability&#13;
of those sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 --&#13;
the peasantry had for generatio:ns reproduced themselves and their&#13;
source of livelihood came under such strain that long-term emigration&#13;
by youthful members of rural households increasingly replaced the&#13;
circulation that had more traditionally been a means of tempo:rary adjust-&#13;
ment to life-cycle needs and perodic stress.   Circulation, notably&#13;
seasonal movernents, gave way in numerous places to long-teim structural&#13;
migration, m'uch of it to urban areas.&#13;
An outstanding feature of the post-colonial era has been the rapid&#13;
growth of urbanisation.  Although urban growth has reflected natural&#13;
population growth and in some places reclassification of areas as urban,&#13;
the shaking loose of rural populations has played a major role.  In&#13;
Latin America, the rural-urban migration that has occurred in the past&#13;
20 years or sc, has reflected the rapid commercialisation of agriculture&#13;
and a transition to capitalist wage-labour relations of production in&#13;
agriculture.  That transition was aided by such measures as "land&#13;
reform" in the wake of the formation in 1961 of the Alliance for Progress,&#13;
established under the aegis of the USA to forestall further revolutions&#13;
along the lines of the Cuban Revolution.&#13;
Land reform is often regarded as a means of arresting rural out-&#13;
migration, on the grounds that access to land (and land distribution)&#13;
determine the propensity to rnigrate, as suggested in various micro-&#13;
studies.1   However, that overlooks the reality of land reforms as&#13;
implemented in Latin America and elsewhere.  Most have redistributed&#13;
r elatively little land, and have had their principal impact through&#13;
accelerating the transition to commerdal farming by landlords, increas-&#13;
ing land utilisation, and leading to the replacement of quasi-feudal&#13;
relations of production by wage labour; tenants have been pushed off&#13;
the land as landowners converted to agro-export crops or expanded&#13;
livestock production; and attached labourers have been widely replaced&#13;
1 See, e.g. J. Connell, B. Dasgupta, R. Laishley and M. Lipton:&#13;

by use of seasonal and casual labour.  The peasantry scarcely acquired&#13;
access to more land or greater security to the land they did possess,&#13;
except to a certain extent where the land reform was coupled with some&#13;
sort of co-operative production programme.  In effect, land reform as&#13;
practised in countries such as Bolivia, Chile and Peru helped increase&#13;
rural out-migration.2  At the same time, the conmercialisation of agri-&#13;
culture, the transition in social relations of production and the wholesale&#13;
mechanisation that accompanied land reform increased the seasonality of&#13;
employment and led to a growth of labour circulation.  Much of this&#13;
has been from the peasant-occupied highland areas to valley estates.&#13;
But a major, untrumpeted phenomenon has been seasonal and daily&#13;
labour circulation by workers residing in urban or suburban areas.  A&#13;
classic case is that of the boias-frias in Sao Paulo; groups of workers&#13;
assemble at dawn to be hired and transported to work on estates, often&#13;
for a day or two, sometimes for a few weeks or months.3  In Senegambia,&#13;
for example, an outflow occurs from towns as men become seasonal&#13;
groundnut farmers working on plots provided by village landowners in&#13;
return for a specific number of days' labour.4  In Sierra Leone, gangs&#13;
of wage workers are hired in towns to prepare wet-season rice farms in&#13;
distant villages.  Similar forms of temporary population mobility have&#13;
occurred in other economies undergoing agricultural commercialisation&#13;
1  All these linked phenomena are assessed empirically elsewhere.&#13;

2  To the extent it lowered incomes of the rural poor it widened&#13;
the rural-urban "wage differential", in the jargon of the essentially&#13;
neo-classical models of migration.  But it would be analytically feeble&#13;
to attribute the migration to the static notion of the "wage-differential"&#13;
rather than to the land reform and the development strategy underlying&#13;
it.&#13;

and industr ialisation.  What the phenomenon typically represents is&#13;
semi-proletarianisation, with the workers and their families surviving&#13;
through a combination of temporary wage labour and petty production in&#13;
the urban economy, or petty trade or "service" activities that amount to&#13;
little more than informal transfers through which the poor survive.  In&#13;
the process, temporary population mobility through labour circulation&#13;
has become a vital aspect of bare survival.  But that scarcely minimises&#13;
the fact that such workers are highly exploited, typically used to&#13;
circumvent minimum wage and social security laws, and exposed to&#13;
harsh working conditions.  Clairns that population mobility is beneficial&#13;
have to be seen in that coiitext.&#13;
In Africa recent patterns of population mobility have differed to&#13;
some extent from those found in the more industrialised countries of&#13;
Latin America.   In Africa, the drawn-out process of decolonisation&#13;
resulted in the emergence of many new nation states. I  hus, the&#13;
former French colony of French West Africa was dissolved into eight&#13;
new states.   Each of the indlependent African countries generated a&#13;
new or much enlarged national bureaucracy located in the capital city or&#13;
in several major urban conurbations.  B efore independence, Black&#13;
Africans in the main, except when required as temporary workers or as&#13;
servants, had been segregated from other groups by being kept in the&#13;
countryside or in small trading towns, while Europeans dominated adminis-&#13;
trative and business activities in the cities, with other foreigners&#13;
(mostly from the Middle East) being dominant in trade.  Independence&#13;
removed a psychological barrier separating "white cities" from the&#13;
"black countryside".2  The r esult was a massive trek to the cities,&#13;
with some urban areas growing at between 5 and 10 per cent a year,&#13;
coupled with a tendency for small and intermediate towns to stagnate as&#13;
many moved to. larger towns.   Urban primacy became a feature of&#13;
p1opulation growth and redistribution.&#13;
1  Around 1980, there were 56 countries in Africa, nearly two-&#13;
thirds of which had fewer than five million inhabitants.&#13;
2  This is not to overlook the "white" estate owners in many&#13;
places.  But they represented a tiny elite.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
Before independence, the main pattern of population mobility had&#13;
been one consisting of stress migration from one rural area to another&#13;
- nomadic movements and life-cycle circulation mainly - and labour&#13;
circulation by unaccompanied men seeking temporary wage labour in the&#13;
cities, estates, mines or public projects so as to be able to pay taxes,&#13;
bride wealth and other life-cycle needs.  Mass movements of refugees&#13;
were also regular features of the landscape.  But urbanisation was&#13;
checked not only by the temporary nature of much of the movement but&#13;
by the fact that mortality rates in urban areas were extremely high&#13;
long into the twentieth century.  But the predominant types of move&#13;
were temporary in nature.&#13;
In the post-colonial era all those forms of mobility persisted.&#13;
Above all, with tribal difficulties and the political fragmentation of&#13;
Africa, refugee movements have grown alarmingly.   There was also a&#13;
growth in resettlement migration, a shift to family movements and a&#13;
pronounced growth in the propensity of young, single women to go to&#13;
the towns in search of work as domestic servants, in factories, trade&#13;
and office jobs.  There has been some tendency for male-female differ-&#13;
ences in rural-urban migration to decline, as in Zambia and Kenya for&#13;
example, partly attributable to the restructuring of urban employment&#13;
and partly to the improved relative schooling opportunities for girls.&#13;
The situation has not reached that found in large parts of Latin America&#13;
and the Caribbean, where more women have migrated to the urban areas&#13;
than men, but the sex ratios have changed in that direction.&#13;
An aspect of this change is the likely impact on fertility and&#13;
population growth.   Urbanisation has usually been associated with&#13;
lower fertility, and those moving to urban areas have been expected to&#13;
have fewer children than those remaining in rural areas.  Accordingly,&#13;
an increase in -migration has been expected to reduce population growth.&#13;
However, it has certainly increased urban population expansion more&#13;
than proportionately, partly because the age groups most inclined to&#13;
migrate to the towns are in the childbearing range and partly because&#13;
in most countries migrants tend to have higher fertility than the resident&#13;
1 See, for instance, J.R. Rogge: "Refugee migration and resettle-&#13;
ment", in J.I. Clarke and L.A. Kosinski (eds.): Redistribution of&#13;

population of similar age and sodio-economic background.  As far as&#13;
relative fertility behaviour is corncerned, there have been exceptions to&#13;
this pattern, the most notable being Nigeria.  There, prolonged post-&#13;
partum sexual abstinence in rural areas has traditionally reduced fertility;&#13;
women migrating into urban areas have tended to greatly reduce the&#13;
period of abstinence, which "has helped raise fertility.  Thus, in a&#13;
few places rural-urban migration may have increased total population&#13;
growth, especially where infaLnt., child and adult mortality are all lower&#13;
in urban areas.&#13;
Another feature of African migration that has been changing is the&#13;
pattern of labour circulation.  Men have long constituted the great&#13;
majority oi seasonal and other circulants, resulting in separation of&#13;
husbands and wives for large proportions of years in which childbearing&#13;
is at its height. Although the evidence does not suggest this has&#13;
substantially reduced rural fertility levels, it has surely had some&#13;
efEfect. In recent years, however, growing proportions of adult male&#13;
migrants have become more rooted to urban areas, staying there&#13;
continuous:ly for years rather than months at a time.  To compensate,&#13;
there has been a growth in female circulation, as wives have gone to&#13;
the towns to stay with thLeir husbands or to find temporary work for&#13;
themselves.   In effect, the increased duration of male out-migration&#13;
has increased female mob:Llity, and probably raised (rural) fertility&#13;
levels in the process.&#13;
There is a large body of studies on these relationships.  See,&#13;

One change that should be causing more international concern than&#13;
it has received is the impact of population growth on the livelihood of&#13;
nomads.    For population growth in settled rural areas has led to&#13;
various "spontaneous resettlements" by agricultural groups, taking over&#13;
land periodically used by nomads, or even by shifting cultivators, thus&#13;
disrupting the subsistence strategy of such migratory populations.&#13;
This has been a feature in a few post-colonial African states;  for&#13;
example, the Afar pastoral nomads suffered terribly through the irri-&#13;
gated settlement of the Awash valley in Ethiopia, losing dry-season&#13;
grazing land and being forced in the 1970s to adopt new and less&#13;
satisfactory mobility patterns. The effects on migratory populations of&#13;
population growth and redistribution has received relatively little&#13;
analytical attention, perhaps partly because the phenomena scarcely fit&#13;
the mainstream models for analysing migration.&#13;
In sum, in post-colonial Africa, besides the worsening refugee&#13;
movements, the most conspicuous developments have been the rapid rate&#13;
of urbanisation, the growth of longer-term resettlement migration and&#13;
the relative and absolute growth of female migration.  There have&#13;
continued to be nomadic movements and stress migration, the latter&#13;
increasingly associated with the "commodity squeeze" due to soil erosion,&#13;
adverse terms of trade, droughts and famines.   But above all the&#13;
extent of population mobility in its various forms has increased.&#13;
In Asia that generalisation would also probably hold for most&#13;
regions, though in India the rates of rural out-migration on average&#13;
have remained fairly low.  Many of the larger-scale movements have&#13;
followed political disturbances, or natural shocks whose effects on&#13;
subsistence economies have been intensified by changes in the productive&#13;
structure disturbing the system of "exchange entitlements".  In many&#13;
rural areas in South and South-East Asia, the pace of agrarian change&#13;
has not been rapid, and in such places the proportions leaving the&#13;
villages permanently have not been large. Limitations on the absorptive&#13;
capacity of great cities have also checked rural-urban migration, while&#13;

1982).&#13;

some efforts in the region have been devoted to urban decentralisation&#13;
and rural resettlement programmes.    Particularly in the "newly-&#13;
industrialising countries" of South-East Asia, rural-urban migrants have&#13;
provided 1:he nucleus of an industrial proletariat.  And given the&#13;
nature of that industrialisation, relying on low-wage unskilled labour,&#13;
the cities have attracted at least as many young women as men migrants.&#13;
Another feature of populatiorn mobility in Asian countries is labour&#13;
circulation, a reflection of land fragmentation and the agrarian structure&#13;
of production.  But even so, the duration of circulation has grown in&#13;
recent years with many more rural migrants settling in cities and towns.&#13;
Before attempting to assess the State response to population redistri-&#13;
bution in Asia and elsewhere, one should recall the main trends against&#13;
which policies have evolved.  In most low-income countries the pace of&#13;
urbanisation has been considerable, and a feature of many countries has&#13;
been the growth of urban concentration, often exhibited by so-called&#13;
primate cities, such as Jakarta, Bangkok-Thonburi, Seoul and Mexicc&#13;
City.   Indeed, the growth of mega-cities has been a striking feature&#13;
of recent years, far surpassing the size and growth of many older giant&#13;
dties.   As an example, in 1950 London was the second largest city in&#13;
the world in terms of population, a long way ahead of the third largest;&#13;
by the year 2000, it is projected to be the twenty-sixth largest, at&#13;
wvhich time Mexico City will be the largest followed by Sao Paulo, at 31&#13;
rnillion and 26 million respectively, whereas in 1950 Mexico City had a&#13;
population of just 3 million.2  Such changes are truly profound.&#13;
Indeed, the twentieth century could be called the century of urbanisation.&#13;
In 1800, only 5 per cent of the world's population lived in urban areas;&#13;
using comlparable measures, by 1900 the figure had risen to 13 per&#13;
cent, and by 1950 to 29 per cent, when most of the urban dwellers&#13;
lived in the industrialised countries.  In 1950, the proportion of the&#13;
1 ThLus in the Republic of Korea women have had a higher propen-&#13;
sity to migrate from rural areaLs.  ESCAP: Migrration, urbanisation and&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
population in low-income countries living in urban areas was less than&#13;
17 per cent; by -1980, it was over 30 per cent and is projected to&#13;
increase to about 44 per cent by the year 2000.  Even so, the urban-&#13;
isation rate in those countries actually conceals the growth of urban&#13;
populations, for between the end of the Second World War and 1975&#13;
their urban populations more than doubled.  The rate of increase of&#13;
urbanisation has been greatest in Africa and Latin America, as can be&#13;
seen in table 2.&#13;
In the post-1945 era, industrial employment levels in those&#13;
countries grew much less than the growth of urbanisation, most&#13;
strikingly in Latin America and Africa.  What is more, many of those&#13;
classified in urban-industrial jobs have in fact been eking out a petty&#13;
existence in what has been called euphemistically the "informal sector".&#13;
The rate of rural-urban migration accompanying this urbanisation&#13;
has often been depicted as historically unprecedented.  There is no&#13;
convincing evidence to support that contention, for in Western Europe&#13;
industrialisation and the preceding agricultural "revolution" were&#13;
accompanied by a massive rural exodus.  But there have been several&#13;
significant differences between the migration to the cities and towns of&#13;
Europe between the sixteenth and nineteenth centuries and that which&#13;
has been occurring in recent years in many low-income industrialising&#13;
countries.  The primary difference is epidemiological.  In Europe, the&#13;
cities were for centuries the main breeding ground for diseases that&#13;
ravaged the populations in them; urban mortality levels were often&#13;
incredibly high, much higher than In the surrounding countryside.&#13;
As a consequence, massive rural-urban migration, mostly consisting of&#13;
people looking for work, was required just to maintain the size of the&#13;
urban population.   Today, many of the worst urban diseases have&#13;
been brought under much better control, and though sanitation and&#13;
epidemics are a constant scourge for the populations of the so-called&#13;
Third World cities, life expectancy in most of them is higher or no&#13;
lower than in the surrounding rural areas.  This means that a similar&#13;
rate of rural-urban migration in those countries will have a much more&#13;
pronounced impact on the growth of urban populations than was the&#13;
case in Western Europe.   So, rural emigration has been a much more&#13;
immediate factor in recent urban expansion, though more so in sub-&#13;
Saharan Africa, for example, than in most of Latin America.&#13;

There is some debate about the extent to which rural-urban&#13;
migration has contributed to urban population growth.  It has been&#13;
estimated that about 60 per cent of urban growth in low-income countries&#13;
in the 1960s and 1970s was due to natural increase within urban areas,&#13;
the remainder due to in-migration and reclassification.  But in some&#13;
countries urban in-migration has accounted for about two-thirds of the&#13;
urban growth - as, for example, in the case of Seoul and Dar-es-Salaam&#13;
in the 1960s and early 1970s.2  Moreover, the high rates of urban&#13;
natural increase also partially reflect the indirect contribution of&#13;
migration, in that most migrants have been concentrated in the child-&#13;
bearing age range and have usually had higher fertility preferences and&#13;
behaviour than urban residents.3&#13;
A second contrast between urbanisation occurring in low-income&#13;
countries and the historical experience of the industrialised countries is&#13;
that there is much less opportunity for escape through emigration for&#13;
those displaced by the transformation of agricultural relations of pro-&#13;
duction, mechanisation and land consolidation and the fragmentation of&#13;
the remaining available land, or for those unable to get into urban-&#13;
industrial jobs.  In the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries,&#13;
European working-class rejects were able to flock to all parts of the&#13;
globe.   But when reverse flows into those countries began, mainly&#13;
from colonies and former colonies, barriers were hastily erected. In&#13;
the UK, for example, restrictions on immigration began as early as&#13;
1905, at a time when signs of a surplus population problem in the&#13;
country had become clear.   This development frightened away many&#13;

Affairs:  Pafterns of urban and rural population growth (New York,&#13;

the relative coiitributions of natural increase and migration, see A.&#13;

lower-class migrants, just as thLe introduction of literacy tests for&#13;
potential nmigrants into the USA in 1917 started a process of restricting&#13;
lower-class migrants into that country.  Elsewhere, similar barriers&#13;
started to go up early in the twentieth century.  By the 1960s whole-&#13;
sale restrictions had become comrnon; thus, in the UK little immigration&#13;
was permitted after 1962; ancd as the recent depression has intensified,&#13;
sio barriers; in other European countries have been strengthened.&#13;
Such restrictions have meant that for the growing surplus population&#13;
in low-income countries there were few places to go.  Moreover, as the&#13;
restrictions were tightened their discriminatory tendencies were&#13;
strengthened.   Most notably, the global economic structure and the&#13;
international division of labour meant that the dynamic of scientific&#13;
progress and technological innovation, along with related opportunities&#13;
for "educated" employment, wvere firmly located in the metropolitan&#13;
countries, or in branches of multinational corporations based in OECD&#13;
countries.  It has been estimated that in the 1960s and 1970s somewhat&#13;
over 90 per cent of all expenditure on research and development was&#13;
concentrated in industrialised cou ntries.  This pattern fadlitated and&#13;
accentuated what has been known familiarly as the "brain drain".&#13;
Many governments have spent large proportions of their meagre national&#13;
budgets oIn tertiary education, only to see their scientists, engineers,&#13;
cloctors and other graduates leave the country.  In turn, the industries&#13;
in those countries have re]ied on imported technologies and inappropriate&#13;
productive structures for their available resources.  With the inflow of&#13;
"rtemporay migrant' workers and managers of multinational corporations&#13;
and the use of "return-migrants" who have acquired their engineering&#13;
and management ideas in universities in the industrialised countries,&#13;
migration has in effect encouraged technological options that are often&#13;
economically socially irrational.1 The "imported" technological-industrial&#13;
organisations have commonly absorbed large proportions of the remaining&#13;
trained or highly schooled workforce, as well as the economic surplus&#13;
potentially available for investmenet in indigenous capital accumulation.&#13;
1 For useful empirical studies of this phenomenon, see L.T. Wells:&#13;
Economic ¢lan and engineering man: Choice of technology in a low-wage&#13;
e-conomy (Cambridge, Mass., Deve]opment Research Center, 1976).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
Another set of Istylised facts" concerns the links betwen population&#13;
growth, employment growth and migration.   Rapid rates of population&#13;
growth have commonly not been matched by commensurate employment&#13;
growth rates, nor by changes in patterns of income distribution that&#13;
would enable the poor to eke out a human existence.   Demographic&#13;
growth has increased pressure on household units of petty production,&#13;
helping the process of disintegration of rural productive units based on&#13;
household, kinship, compound or tribal divisions of labour.  What&#13;
happened earlier in the colonial "labour reserve" areas has intensified&#13;
and spread to numerous others, where demographic pressure has been&#13;
crucially coupled with shrinking access to land, livestock and other&#13;
means of production and raw materials.  Youths have faced bleak and&#13;
worsening prospects of low incomes in their villages, and have seen the&#13;
likelihood of inheriting cultivable land diminish and/or recede into the&#13;
distant future, with increasing life expectancy of parents and growing&#13;
numbers of siblings to share inheritances.  And they have surely been&#13;
encouraged by elder kin to migrate in search of alternative sources of&#13;
income.  It is scarcely surprising that the peak age group in migration&#13;
is 15 to 19 in many countries, and 20 to 24 in others.  Then they&#13;
have been expected to remit part of their earnings to compensate for&#13;
their absence as workers or to make up the shortfall in consumption of&#13;
remaining family members.&#13;
V.   Migration and Recent State Policies&#13;
Throughout human history governments have practised population&#13;
mobility policies, often explicitly as part of an overall development&#13;
strategy but often too implicitly, without a conscious intention to influ-&#13;
ence mobility Per se.  While it is hard to discern the overall policy in&#13;
all cases, usually the class interests controlling the State strongly&#13;
influence the direction of policy and the pattern of population mobility&#13;
that results.&#13;
Before linking types of development strategy to types of population&#13;
mobility policy, one can delineate seven major types of migration policy:&#13;
1.   To discourage population mobility generally.  This is rarely&#13;
desirable on social welfare grounds, in so far as mobility reflects per-&#13;
sonal "choice" in some sense and, a priori, a mobile population is better&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 4 -&#13;
able to adjust to the dynamics of a growing and structually-*changing&#13;
economy.    And in some environments mobility will be an essential&#13;
factor for social integration.&#13;
2.   To discourage rural out-migration, primarily by improving&#13;
income opportunities, living standards and social infrastructure in rural&#13;
aLreas of potential out-migration.  In theoretical discussion, this sooner&#13;
or later raises questions about the need for land reform, and protective&#13;
labour legislation for rural workers.&#13;
3.   To redirect rural out-migration from relatively poor or densely&#13;
settled areas to economically advancing or frontier rural zones.  This&#13;
usually leads to proposals for land colonisation and land settlement&#13;
schemes.&#13;
4.   To encourage rural-urban migration.  Such policies might be&#13;
facilitating or actively encouraging migration.  They may very well be&#13;
coupled with a policy of reducinrg inequalities and poverty, both of&#13;
which tend! to be worse in rural areas.&#13;
5.   To encourage urban dispersal, through predetermined patterns&#13;
of rural-urban and intra-urban migration, and sometimes urban-rural&#13;
migration from specific urban conglomerations.  This has been associ-&#13;
aLted with the establishment of "urban growth poles" and the desire to&#13;
reduce or avoid "urban primacy".&#13;
6.   To  encourage urban-ruLral migration,  checking urban in-&#13;
raigration.  This policy has been associated with selective controls on&#13;
urban entry or residence qualifications, as has been attempted in such&#13;
places as Dar-es-Salaam and Jakarta and in China with its "rlstication"&#13;
programme for urban youths.&#13;
7.   To help assimilate migr ants into receiving areas, usually&#13;
towns and cities.  In moet countries, this policy has been given lower&#13;
priority than one or more of the others.  But it can be seen as facili-&#13;
tating urban in-migration.&#13;
These seven types of popu]ation mobility policy exclude indirect&#13;
policies, that is, those that ar-e migration-influencing without that being&#13;
their principal objective.  Ignoring those, it is striking that in every&#13;
region of the world, the 1980 UN survey of governments' perceptions of&#13;
population problems found that: more governments had policies ostensibly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
designed to "slow or reverse internal migration" than policies to reduce&#13;
fertility (table 3).  Social observers in some industrialised countries&#13;
may typically regard population growth as the primary demographic&#13;
cause for concern.   But, in the main, in the low-income countries&#13;
themselves the perception seems somewhat different.&#13;

As a working hypothesis, population mobility policies have tended&#13;
to correspond to the needs of the dominant socio-economic classes.&#13;
Somewhat simplifying, the principal social types of State can be&#13;
described as landlord-dominated, emergent capitalist and centrally&#13;
planned.&#13;
In landlord-dominated countries the predominant type of population&#13;
mobility policy has consisted of limitations on rural out-migration coupled&#13;
with some directed migration, mostly intra-rural, though in some places&#13;
characterised by low population density also urban-rural migration for&#13;
harvest periods or to work on local infrastructural projects.  Controls&#13;
on rural emigration have typically included legal restrictions on move-&#13;
ment by peasants and other direct producers.   At the extreme, serfs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-  316  -&#13;
in Europe were "bound to the earth" (glabae adscripti).  But a more&#13;
pervasive feature of such States has been decentralised political power,&#13;
usually in the absence of a sirong central government.  In such&#13;
circumstances landlords, estates and other dominant interests have&#13;
moulded local laws and "unofficial" reguLations to limit "free" mobility;&#13;
local taxes have proliferated, contrived indebtedness and coerced labour&#13;
have been enforced by local militia, and harsh penalties have been&#13;
instigated to discourage unsanctioned movement.  In urban areas&#13;
regulations, such as legaLly enforced guild-like barriers to occupations,&#13;
have not on]y discouraged in-migration but limited urban out-migration,&#13;
because of the personal risk of surrendering a niche in a complex social&#13;
order.   Particularly when suplx)rted by colonial authorities, landlords&#13;
and estates have also been able to discourage urbanisation through&#13;
heavy "urban" taxes and diverse regulations, which was a major reason&#13;
for the limited urbanisaticin and even deurbanisation in colonial eras.&#13;
Another symptomatic policy in landlord-dominated societies is the&#13;
underdevelopment of a land market, a situation preserved in part by&#13;
the abserLce of formal systems for registering land titles.  In such&#13;
circumstances, not only have the. powerful been able to expropriate or&#13;
control land, if and when they needed to do so, but smallholders have&#13;
been very reluctant to leave even temporarily for fear of losing land&#13;
and traditional rights and have also had the value of their land reduced&#13;
through the absence of title, making it hard to sell.&#13;
One could expand the list of policies favoured by landlord interests,&#13;
but the one of most signilicance in recent years is the use of colonisation&#13;
schemes.   These have tended to be implemented where social tensions&#13;
have risen because peasants havre been under economic pressure or&#13;
because landlords have been unable to secure adequate surplus.&#13;
Above all, they have been used as an alternative to. land reform, indeed&#13;
as a means of forestalling land reform.  As Hirschman concluded,&#13;
"colonisation may be expected to be amply tried out in a country where&#13;
the landowners are powerful and where virgin, state-owned lands are&#13;
plentiful" 1  Colonisatiort schemes have been introduced in many&#13;

countries, including Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Guatemala, Guyana, Peru,&#13;
Venezuela, India, Malaysia, the Philippines and Indonesia.  In Brazil,&#13;
it seems the huge Rond6nia scheme has led to the reproduction of&#13;
productive relations found in areas from which peasants have fled.1&#13;
In Malaysia, resettlement schemes under FELDA and FELCRA have&#13;
shifted landless or near landless peasants from kampongs in which land&#13;
fragmentation has become acute, but they have probably acted as a&#13;
means of preventing more radical land restructuring in the traditional&#13;
kampongs.2    But perhaps the most controversial resettlement schemes&#13;
have been those associated with "transmigration" in Indonesia, which&#13;
began early in the twentieth century; plantations benefited from low-&#13;
wage labour, subsidised by the petty production of rice, part of the&#13;
surplus population was transported while pressure for land reform was&#13;
effectively checked.3  Colonisation schemes in such countries have not&#13;
only reflected the interests of agricultural estates or landlords, but&#13;
have been favoured where traditional landed interests have remained&#13;
strong and been allied to urban-industrial or foreign interests controlling&#13;
the direction of government policies.&#13;
What is clear is that usually colonisation schemes have been rather&#13;
unsuccessful for those directly involved, and in many cases large&#13;

proportionis of the settlers have left.  Successful cases might be cited,&#13;
but usually some special factor has been involved.  The example of&#13;
FELDA in Malaysia is usually given as the most successful scheme. But&#13;
it is worth reflecting that it has been enormously costly, made possible&#13;
by high rates of national economic growth and subsidies frcan abroad,&#13;
and has been placed at the centre of the government's development&#13;
strategy, primarily to benefit the rural Malay population.  It has in&#13;
addition created rising "structurral underemployment" in the settlement&#13;
schemes, as families have gr own without the ability to expand their&#13;
cropping areas or as labour requirements per plot have decLined.  It&#13;
has led to a problem of nsecond generation" out-migration, threatening&#13;
to leave schemes with an aging and increasingly unproductive labour&#13;
force. Meanwhile, back in the kampongs from which settlers have been&#13;
drawn, a conspicuous feature has been that land fragmentation and&#13;
underutilisation have remained high, since many FELDA settlers have&#13;
retained or inherited smalL plots in their old kampongs.&#13;
More generally, coloinisation schemes have reduced the pressure to&#13;
change social relations of production in areas of out-migration. It&#13;
certainly cannot be presumed that the reduction in population pressure&#13;
in such areas leads to rising living standards and improvements ifi&#13;
productivity leading to acceleratecl economic growth.  Thus, if settlers&#13;
were drawn from landlord-dominalted areas, the mass of the popuLation&#13;
remaining would be unlikely to experience improved living standards,&#13;
because landlords, middlemen, morneylenders and other exploiting elements&#13;

would take steps to absorb any surplus over traditional subsistence&#13;
standards of living.  Only if colonisation schemes were coupled with&#13;
reforms in productive relations could the poor be expected to benefit to&#13;
any substantial extent.  It is often a lack of integrated development&#13;
strategy that has shown colonisation schemes to be little more than&#13;
palliatives.  Even the highly costly transmigration programme in&#13;
Indonesia long had to operate in the context of a national development&#13;
strategy tending to lead to concentrated urban development.1&#13;
Observers of colonisation schemes have tended to attribute lack of&#13;
success to institutional factors, such as poor selection of settlers or&#13;
sites, lack of infrastructure, divided responsibility among government&#13;
agencies or lack of credit or technical assistance.2  But such limitations&#13;
have typically reflected a lack of political commitment to make them&#13;
economically prosperous or to create farming communities that could&#13;
compete against pre-existing estate or landlord interests. In Chile and&#13;
Guatemala, to take just two of many examples, this was epitomised by&#13;
the fact that colonisation agencies created such small farm units that&#13;
settlers had to supplement their meagre income through seasonal migration&#13;
to work for wages on estates or in urban areas.    It is surely the&#13;
case that landlords, and landed interests generally, have favoured such&#13;
schemes to pre-empt pressure for meaningful land reform.  And the&#13;
urban-industrial employers have favoured them over land reforms that&#13;
would redistribute land to the mass of the rural population.&#13;
In many low-income countries landlords and other rural elites have&#13;
had declining influence over government policies. The transition to&#13;
capitalist industrialisation has been associated with the growth in power&#13;
of urban-industrial bourgeoisie and foreign capital. The most significant&#13;

change in rural production has been the relative expansion of commercial&#13;
production based on wage labour, which has often been fosl:ered by&#13;
changes in government policies. The shift to wage labour in agriculture&#13;
has also been favoured, even actively encouraged, by urban industrial&#13;
interests because it has expanded the domestic market for industrial&#13;
goods and services and removed traditional constraints on  population&#13;
mobility.&#13;
The classic case of a change in government policy reflecting a&#13;
change in the socio-economic structure was the UK, where the success-&#13;
ful transition to industrial capitaLlism was marked by the Poor Law of&#13;
1834 which swept away barriers to rural emigration, and led to a massive&#13;
expansion in the wage labour supply to the new urban centres of indus-&#13;
trialisation.1  But in many industrialising countries, an irony of the&#13;
increased rural-urban migr ation of recent years, so widely deplored by&#13;
governments and observers, is that it has been directly linked to&#13;
policies detsigned to speed the trerisformation of traditional sodal relations&#13;
of product:ion.  Perhaps the mosi: widespread has been land reform,&#13;
regarded by many observers as a means of checking rural emigration.&#13;
The objectives of land reform  have varied.  Most commonly, the&#13;
principal objective has been to iiicrease agricultural production and&#13;
transform land tenure systems impeding the expansion of commercial&#13;
farming, so as to increase surplus for industrial investment or urban&#13;
consumption.   Urban and foreign industrialists have favoured land&#13;
reform in so far as it would increase the rural surplus, lower the cost&#13;
of food and thereby lower thLe urban subsistence wage. But land&#13;
reforms as actually implemented have mostly involved little land redistri-&#13;
bution, merely a growth in land use by commercial, capitalist farmers,2&#13;
Commonly, land reforms have induced landlords or estates to displace&#13;
tenants and shift to greater reliance on wage labour, which has been&#13;
mainly required in peak periods of the agricultural cycle.  In the&#13;

intolerable for the rural poor to force them to migrate to seek any&#13;
work.&#13;

process, the peasants' ties with the land have been loosened, leading to&#13;
seasonal circulation between rural areas and between rural and urban&#13;
areas, as well as longer-term rural out-migration.&#13;
Industrial expansion usually requires a mobile labour supply and a&#13;
latent labour reserve in rural areas, and even a "subsidised" circulant&#13;
labour supply (subsidised by smallholder production providing means of&#13;
subsistence to migrant wage workers). But in many industrialising&#13;
countries the creation of a national labour market has led to dysfunctional&#13;
patterns of population redistribution, due in part to rapid population&#13;
growth, capital-intensive industrialisation and the channelling of surplus&#13;
abroad or into the acquisition of imports. Urban unemployment has&#13;
mushroomed, and urban slums made up of squatters have proliferated.&#13;
To a certain extent, these developments have facilitated industrial&#13;
accumulation. But in many instances they have gone well beyond any&#13;
'functional' level, and have absorbed growing resources in transfer&#13;
payments and public investment in social infrastructure.  According to&#13;
a common perception, migrants and the urban unemployed have become&#13;
a political threat as a sullen "lumpenproletariat". Although rural-urban&#13;
migrants probably have relatively low unemployment rates and take&#13;
low-wage jobs in the urban areas, they may well have contributed&#13;
indirectly to rising urban unemployment by displacing urban workers.1&#13;
As governments have attempted to implement policies to alter the&#13;
pattern of population redistribution accompanying population growth,&#13;
changing social relations of rural production, mechanisation in agriculture&#13;
and industriahsation, the emphasis placed on land reform of one type or&#13;
another has grown.   In Latin America it became a major policy In the&#13;
1960s in the wake of the establishment of the Alliance of Progress set&#13;
up after the Cuban Revolution.  Some reforms redistributed land away&#13;
1 It is difficult to unravel the inter-relationships between migration&#13;
and unemployment.    Some observers have noted that migrants have&#13;
below average unemployment rates in urban areas and have deduced&#13;
that migration does not contribute to urban unemployment.  Such&#13;
reasoning ignores possible selectivity of "return" migration and the&#13;
possible migrant-resident displacement effect.  If migrants had low&#13;
reservation wages and were relatively exploitable, they would be pre-&#13;
ferred for many industrial jobs.  For a review of the evidence and&#13;
discussion of the methodological pitfalls, see G. Standing: Anal sing&#13;
the inter-relationships between migration and employment (Geneva, ILO,&#13;
1982).&#13;

from large haciendas to smaL[ho:lclers or the landless, though even in&#13;
those cases many peasants were subsequently dispossessed or forced to&#13;
leave because of lack of resources and income. But in most cases of&#13;
nreform" the result was greater land consolidation by landlords or&#13;
agricultural corporations and an accelerated shift towards commercial,&#13;
export-oriented agriculture based on wage labour and mechanisation,&#13;
wrhich in turn involved dispossession of tenant farmers, labour displace-&#13;
rment and growing seasonality of employment, all of which increased the&#13;
precariousness of the rural poor and encouraged them to leave, either&#13;
to become circulatory labouresrs or long-term rural-urban migrants.&#13;
T'here have been a few exceptionS, where land redistributiorn has tempor-&#13;
arily slowed the process of ciass differentiation and rural proletarian-&#13;
isation.  But in most cases the land reform as implemented increased&#13;
economic surplus while creating more landlessness, a rural surplus&#13;
population and out-migration.  It is inadequate for those who believe&#13;
land reform should reduce migration to point to a 'failure" to implement&#13;
land reforn programmes fully, because the primary objective of most&#13;
such reforms has been the 'modernisation" of agriculture, increased&#13;
land utilisation, the generation of surplus for capital accurnulation and&#13;
the creation of a mobile wage labour supply.  The difficulty lies in&#13;
expecting a major cause of accelerated migration to be useful as a means&#13;
of arresting that migration.  To achieve the latter would require a&#13;
radical change in the social relat:ions of production and distribution,&#13;
and in effect a different set of social objectives.&#13;
As noted earlier, colonisation and resettlement programmes, involv-&#13;
ing organised migration, have been favoured by landlords fearful of the&#13;
pressures for land reform and JEavoured by urban-industrial interests&#13;
intent on seeing part of the growing surplus population absorbed in&#13;
income generating activity, partic:ularly if such schemes hold out the&#13;
promise of lower-priced food and do not force up wages by drawing&#13;
large numbers of workers into high-income activities.  In practice,&#13;
such schemes have been enormously costly and been unable to reach&#13;

Enclosure movement in the UK is most apt.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
more than a tiny fraction of the population.  Some colonisation and&#13;
settlement schemes have helped perpetuate forms of production under&#13;
stress, allowing the growth of a new layer of landlords or a period in&#13;
which landlords could dispense with old practices and modernise farming&#13;
methods.   Others - or the same schemes - have created a new group&#13;
of smallholders to supply low-priced food for agricultural, mining and&#13;
manufacturing wage workers, thereby enabling employers to keep down&#13;
wage rates.   But they have rarely successfully arrested rural-urban&#13;
migration, because they have not been designed to substantially alter&#13;
the pattern of income distribution.  And almost inevitably, population&#13;
growth has merely accelerated land fragmentation, and thus more&#13;
pressure to migrate.&#13;
As an alternative policy, many observers have believed that&#13;
integrated rural development could slow migration to the cities by&#13;
boosting rural incomes and social services and amenities.  Again, this&#13;
strategy would scarcely succeed unless there were radical changes in&#13;
income distribution and social relations of production.  Typically, a&#13;
package of credit, subsidies and public investment in roads, schools&#13;
and other amenities has encouraged expansion by large farmers, increased&#13;
class differentiation in agricultural areas as some farmers have expanded&#13;
and acquired land or key resources from others, and led to labour-&#13;
displacing mechanisation.  The rising productivity of large farms has&#13;
tended to lower the price of crops, leading to growing pressure on&#13;
small-scale farmers to sell land.2  And in many cases it has forced&#13;
peasants to circulate in the slack seasons, or to send children or other&#13;
dependants to the towns to earn cash to enable them to survive, a&#13;
strategy that has usually only postponed the demise of the production&#13;
unit and led to a gradual assimilation to an urban way of life.&#13;
One of the most successful and costly programmes, FELDA,&#13;
"shifted" less than 3 per cent of Malaysia's population to settlements&#13;
between 1956 and 1980, despite a huge commitment by the government&#13;
and the fact that some schemes were on or close to established kampongs.&#13;
Many of those settlers were probably not potential rural-urban migrants,&#13;
and it is arguable that the resettlement programme increased population&#13;
mobility rather than checked it, since it stimulated mobility of the&#13;
previously relatively immobile Malay population.&#13;

As ior the social elements of integrated rural development pro-&#13;
grammes, it is apparent that rural schools, for instance, may help to&#13;
raise the potential productivity of farmers, but in practice they provide&#13;
youths with the credentials and aspirations suited to urban-industrial&#13;
jobs. Similarly, road construcl:ion increases contact with distant cities&#13;
and towns, aind makes rural emigration easier.&#13;
In any case, an integrated rural development programme is a&#13;
long-term strategy and necessalily involves considerable resources and&#13;
political commitment.  In the short-term, some governments have been&#13;
attracted to the much less costly expedient of raising barriers to urban&#13;
in-migration.  Four major types of policy have been tried.  Perhaps&#13;
the most widespread has been the systematic demolition of squatter&#13;
settlements in major cities, pracl:ised with sickening regularity for many&#13;
years in large parts of Latin America, Asia and Africa.  Often the&#13;
urban "middle-classes" have feared the potential political threat from&#13;
the impoverished population in such settlements, even though many&#13;
analyses have suggested that not only have they provided their&#13;
inhabitants with the means of survival but that the residen,ts are gener-&#13;
ally politicaly conservative, marginal only in the sense that they are&#13;
the most exploitable segment of the urban labour force. I  In some&#13;
cities, such as Nairobi, repeated demolitions of squatter settlements&#13;
have influenced the pattern of urban growth, but there is little evidence&#13;
that they have substantially discouraged urban in-migration. In most&#13;
cases, squatters have merely re-erected dwellings on the site from&#13;
which they were evicted.2 But in some countries, "anti-accommodation"&#13;
policies have led to a mushrooming of satellite urban areas, often contain-&#13;
ing large numbers of unemployed.&#13;

A second policy has been urban population restriction through use&#13;
of licenses or residence permits.  In special circumstances these might&#13;
be effective, as in South Africa where the internal passport system has&#13;
restricted black migration into the towns.  But the inequities are&#13;
always severe.   One celebrated case is that of Jakarta, where the&#13;
Governor established a pass system in 1970, allowing migrants a six-&#13;
month residence permit, after depositing with the police double the&#13;
amount of money required to pay for their return journey to their home&#13;
area; at the end of the six months they had to prove they had a job&#13;
and a dwelling, otherwise they were forced to leave.  Strict limits&#13;
were also placed on the number of people allowed to enter and remain in&#13;
the city.  Given the economic and social pressures forcing many of the&#13;
rural population to move to urban areas, those controls had two predict-&#13;
able outcomes.  They resulted in an enormously profitable pattern of&#13;
petty corruption, as migrants bought time in the city, and they led to&#13;
a rapid growth in commuting and circulation between surrounding villages&#13;
and the city.  As a consequence, the daytime population of Jakarta&#13;
became very much larger than the de jure or recognised population.&#13;
A variant of such controls has been periodic expulsions of unem-&#13;
ployed migrants from cities, a practice that has been attempted in parts&#13;
of Africa, notably the Congo, Niger, Tanzania and Zaire.  But they&#13;
have had little visible impact, except to create anguish and resentment.1&#13;
A related policy has involved actions against groups of workers&#13;
known to consist mainly of urban in-migrants, thereby creating a form of&#13;
labour market segmentation.  Thus, street vendors have been banned&#13;
from some city centres, as in Lima, and bicycle rickshaws were banned&#13;
from central Jakarta, so denying migrants a main avenue of city labour&#13;
market entry, and apparently inducing some migrants to leave the&#13;
city.   But these policies have been disruptive and. of limited signifi-&#13;
cance.  Indeed, in all selective policies that have attempted to erect&#13;

barriers to urban in-migration cr drive migrants from cities the main&#13;
effects have been human suffering, bitter resentment, a disruption to&#13;
key urban services and the growth of petty corruption.  They have&#13;
scarcely had much impact on urban in-migration.&#13;
In some countries governments have resorted to a third, more&#13;
systematic policy of urban decentralisation, canmonly attempting to&#13;
reduce or prevent the growth of excessive "urban primacy"1.  In the&#13;
Republic of Korea this policy has had some success, but has been&#13;
largely due to very rapid economic growth and special circumstances&#13;
favouring population growth i3n towns designated for expansion.&#13;
Elsewhere, as in Malaysia, urban growth poles have grown vrery slowly,&#13;
have absorbed huge amounts of public expenditure and have not been&#13;
notably successful in drawing mrigrants from the major cities; and towns&#13;
of the country.  Moreover, there is considerable difficulty in getting&#13;
such urban areas to a mnimaMl size at which there are sufficient economies&#13;
of scale and scope for backward and forward linkages to generate&#13;
industrial investment and atbact capitalist enterprises to the area.&#13;
Among other policies introduced to influence population redistri-&#13;
bution one must mention minimum wage and related labour legislation.&#13;
Consistent with theories that attribute migration primarily to the rural-&#13;
urban average "wage" differential, some observers have favoured a&#13;
policy of reducing urban wages. l  But as urban manual-worker wages&#13;
have not been very high in industrialising economies, any reduction&#13;
might well have severe consequences for labour productivity and labour&#13;
commitmenit.  The real cause for the wide gap between rural and urban&#13;
wages that exists in some low-income countries is the pitifully low wage&#13;
rates and irregularity of employment in rural areas.&#13;
In tlhat context, it is notable that both urban industrialists and&#13;
urban workers have usually supported the implementation of minimum&#13;
wage laws, which have often been directed at those plantations, landlords&#13;
1 M.P. Todaro: "Income expectations, rural-urban migration and&#13;

and estate owners who have been paying their workers little in the form&#13;
of a money wage.&#13;
However, although such laws have helped transform rural labour&#13;
relations, in most countries minimum wage legislation has probably had&#13;
little effect on the rural-urban wage differential. Typically it has&#13;
been circumvented, because of lack of enforcement, which almost certainly&#13;
arises partly because many urban-based industrialists have continued to&#13;
benefit from low rural wages, in so far as they have been a determinant&#13;
of food prices and urban wage rates.&#13;
Where minimum wage legislation has been successfully applied, it&#13;
has encouraged increased mechanisation, labour displacement and a&#13;
substitution of seasonal or casual for permanent labour. Casual workers&#13;
have been least protected by social security benefits, where they exist,&#13;
and rural employers have used seasonal migrants to avoid paying the&#13;
minimum wage or any social security provisions they are supposed to&#13;
pay.   A celebrated case is the systematic use of urban-rural migrant&#13;
workers in Sao Paulo state; known as b6ias-frias, these have no&#13;
bargaining power and are hired in urban areas, so remaining urban&#13;
residents.  In general, yet another irony is that to the extent minimum&#13;
wage legislation leads to the displacement of permanent workers, rural&#13;
(seasonal) unemployment has risen and rural wage incomes have declined.&#13;
So, such laws may well have stimulated rather than reduced rural-urban&#13;
migration.&#13;
In sum, although there are other policies not mentioned in this&#13;
summary review, in industrialising countries afflicted by rising unem-&#13;
ployment and perceived population maldistribution policies to check&#13;
rural-urban migration or to redirect the migration streams have been&#13;
rather unsuccessful.&#13;
It remains to mention policies that have been pursued in certain&#13;
centrally-planned, or socialist, developing countries. For those wishing&#13;
to secure socialist industrialisationldevelopment, two alternative strategies&#13;
1   This is consistent with urban industrialists favouring the&#13;
spread of minimum wage laws, for they have been a means of "freeing"&#13;
rural workers from the restraints represented by pre-capitalist social&#13;
relations of production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

have been proposed, and have been the cause of frequent controversy.&#13;
The firsi: has been to increase the food surplus and mobilise labour&#13;
supply from the countryside for urban industry, through the collec-&#13;
tivisation of agriculture, so freeing labour power to migrate out of rural&#13;
areas.   This was the model epitomised by the USSR.  The second has&#13;
been more populist in origin, inavolving a "pro-peasant" orientation,&#13;
expecting the population to remain in rural areas by encouraging a&#13;
transfer of resources to the countryside, as for example in. Tanzania.&#13;
Those overall strategies aside, in centrally-planned countries three more&#13;
specific policies have emerged.  The first has often been introduced in&#13;
the wake of revolutionary changes in the prevailing mode of production&#13;
and consists of directed migratkin, as pursued with various degrees of&#13;
coercion and thus human suffering in Kampuchea, Viet Nam and China.&#13;
In China, between the 1950E; and 1970s, the "rustication" programme&#13;
involved nearly 15 million city-born youths being sent to rural areas&#13;
and even more rural students in city schools being sent back to the&#13;
countryside.   Such policiesa require a strong administrative apparatus&#13;
and no dloubt cause suffering and resentment, both among those moved&#13;
against their wishes and among the rural population with whom the "city&#13;
dwellers" are settled.  In areas of low population density and labour&#13;
shortage, the influx should raise production.  But in many areas,&#13;
their participation could lower average productivity, if they have neither&#13;
the skills nor the attitudes required.  However, the policy of rustication&#13;
in China may well have defused potential urban unrest and enabled the&#13;
authorities in the cities tD have time to organise city social services and&#13;
public amenities.&#13;
A second policy, favoured by some quasi-socialist countries, is the&#13;
use of rural co-operatives.  One well-known example is Ujamaa in&#13;
Tanzania..  A -difficulty there ;md elsewhere is that the voluntary&#13;
development of "self-reli-ant ', profitable and equitable co-operative&#13;
organisation of production and clistribution is hard to achieve in com-&#13;
munities conditioned by peasant, quasi-feudal or highly competitive&#13;

traditions, in effect where a sense of close community co-operation is&#13;
novel or long-forgotten.  In Guyana, where "co-operativism" has been&#13;
regarded as a cornerstone of government policy, large numbers of&#13;
urban unemployed were sent to interior settlements based on co-operative&#13;
and quasi-military principles; it seems that despite considerable sub-&#13;
sidies many returned to urban areas disillusioned with the relative&#13;
hardships of rural pioneer development life.&#13;
A third approach combines elements of the second and of the&#13;
turban growth pole" strategy, and involves an integrated development&#13;
strategy based on changes in social relations of production in urban as&#13;
well as rural areas.  It implies a commitment to break down the rural-&#13;
urban dichotomy and progressively secure an "urbanisation of the&#13;
countryside".  The country that has most consistently pursued such a&#13;
policy is Cuba, whose policy has been characterised as "a minimum of&#13;
urbanism  and a maximum of ruralism".   The capital, Havana, has&#13;
received relatively little in the way of social resources, while over 300&#13;
new small towns have been set up since 1964 in an attempt to make the&#13;
country a web of small interconnected urban communities comprising a&#13;
predominantly agricultural population.  The comparative success of this&#13;
strategy - whatever its context - in checking the type of migration and&#13;
urban unemployment found in other Latin American countries can be&#13;
assessed in the light of a few telling statistics.  In the past two&#13;
decades, no country in Latin America experienced such balanced growth&#13;
in its rural and urban populations or such low rates of urban population&#13;
growth.   Perhaps most striking of all, and contrary to the experience&#13;
of most other low-income countries, the growth of the capital city has&#13;
lagged behind overall population growth.2&#13;

These results have nol: been without social costs.1 But they have&#13;
been achieved by the estab]Lishment of "rural-urban" communities equipped&#13;
with the infrastructure andi p,roductive organisations. needed to make&#13;
them economically and socially viable. The experience suggests that it&#13;
is possible to check rapid urbanisation and the urban squalor that has&#13;
typically accompanied it.  But to do so it probably requires a broadly-&#13;
based commitment to changte the direction of economic development as&#13;
pursued in most countries.&#13;
VI. Concluding Points&#13;
"Wilthout transfer to another village, a person cannot become&#13;
great."&#13;
[Burmese proverb]&#13;
Men and women have always moved to escape or to achieve, or&#13;
have been forced to move, whether individually or in groups.   In&#13;
doing so, they have often had unforeseen implications for themselves,&#13;
their faimilies, the communities they have left and for those where they&#13;
have settled.  This review has attempted to provide a perspective on&#13;
the links between populatiorL mobility, growth and transformations of the&#13;
productive structure.  Population mobility itself has man y potential&#13;
implications, often through indirect means such as remittances and&#13;
return-migration.  One of the most important aspects of increasing&#13;
mobility is that it tends to increase labour supply, both in terms of&#13;
providing a more flexible labour force and because migrants have tended&#13;
to have above-average labour force participation rates, with many&#13;
women in particular moving from outside the (wage) labour force into&#13;
the labour market through migration.  But there is a genuine danger&#13;
that the commonly desperate movement by many of -the world's poor,&#13;
particularly their migration into rapidly growing cities, will be added to&#13;
the list of prime causeis of economic stagnation, unemployment and&#13;
poverty.   If so - and it is already happening - low-incomne country&#13;
governments and those groups in industrialised countries supporting&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

them will be inclined to justify taking increasingly severe measures to&#13;
control movement - with the resort to compulsory relocation, urban&#13;
entry passes, anti-squatter measures, employment conditions for urban&#13;
settlement, and the like - as an implicit alternative to tackling the&#13;
underlying structural causes of the perceived maldistribution of the&#13;
population.  Depiction of a new spectre can be expected to gather&#13;
momentum and be translated into all sorts of repressive policy - instead&#13;
of hordes of hungry mouths from swollen families, hordes of impoverished&#13;
villagers entering the shanty towns of the Third World and threatening&#13;
the social and economic institutions so cherished by the privileged.&#13;
This is no exaggeration; it is happening already.  Such simplistic&#13;
images must be resisted.&#13;
So it is perhaps worth concluding by reflecting on one of the&#13;
human rights enshrined in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights&#13;
adopted in 1948.  According to Article 13, everyone has the right "to&#13;
freedom of movement and residence within the borders of each state"&#13;
and "to leave any country, including his own, and to return to his&#13;
country".   Many governments have made little attempt to preserve&#13;
those rights, and many show signs of moving in the direction of&#13;
denying them more systematically and more harshly.&#13;

            Population mobility and productive
            relations : demographic links and policy evolution
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This analysis considers changing
            patterns of population mobility in terms of shifts in
            productive structure and social relations of production. It
            is based on the premise that migration analysis cannot be
            divorced from an historical perspective, and in particular,
            that in many low-income regions recent changes in population
            mobility have to be understood in terms of the colonial
            legacy and the attempted transition to capitalist
            industrialization. In that context, it concludes with a
            critical review of government policies designed or expected
            to influence migration rates and patterns, arguing that
            often the policies have effects quite contrary to those
            intended by their advocates. There is a danger that
            desperate movement by the world's poor will be a main
            cause of economic stagnation, unemployment and poverty;
            however, severe measures taken to control this movement,
            which deny the human right to freedom of movement, should
            not be allowed to supersede measures tackling the underlying
            structural causes of the perceived maldistribution of the population.
