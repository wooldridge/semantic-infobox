 This case study was prepared by Pandu Harimurti, Eko Setyo Pambudi, Anna Lorenza Pigazzini, and Ajay Tandon.&#13;
The study was prepared in close consultation with the Ministry of Health (MOH), Indonesia, especially the National&#13;
Social Health Insurance preparation task force under the leadership of Vice Minister, Professor Ghufron Ali Mukti,&#13;
and the MOHâ&#128;&#153;s Center for Health Financing and Risk Protection team, Usman Sumantri, Donald Pardede, Kalsum&#13;
Komaryani, Kamaruzzaman, and Armansyah. The case study benefited from comments received during the UNICO&#13;
Authorsâ&#128;&#153; Workshop in Washington, DC, in July 2012, and from additional comments and suggestions provided by&#13;
Daniel Cotlear (HDN), Toomas Palu (EASHH Sector Manager), Matthew Grant Wai-Poi (PREM), Mitchell Wiener&#13;
(EASP), and Robert Yates (WHO). The team would also like to acknowledge input and guidance from Darren&#13;
Dorkin (EASHH) and Puti Marzoeki (EASHH). Editorial input from Diane Stamm, research assistance from Shita&#13;
Listyadewi, and team support from Emiliana Gunawan are also gratefully acknowledged.&#13;

All people aspire to receive quality, affordable health care. In recent years, this aspiration has&#13;
spurred calls for universal health coverage (UHC) and has given birth to a global UHC&#13;
movement. In 2005, this movement led the World Health Assembly to call on governments to&#13;
â&#128;&#156;develop their health systems, so that all people have access to services and do not suffer&#13;
financial hardship paying for them.â&#128;? In December 2012, the movement prompted the United&#13;
Nations General Assembly to call on governments to â&#128;&#156;urgently and significantly scale-up efforts&#13;
to accelerate the transition towards universal access to affordable and quality healthcare&#13;
services.â&#128;? Today, some 30 middle-income countries are implementing programs that aim to&#13;
advance the transition to UHC, and many other low- and middle-income countries are&#13;
considering launching similar programs.&#13;
The World Bank supports the efforts of countries to share prosperity by transitioning toward&#13;
UHC with the objectives of improving health outcomes, reducing the financial risks associated&#13;
with ill health, and increasing equity. The Bank recognizes that there are many paths toward&#13;
UHC and does not endorse a particular path or set of organizational or financial arrangements to&#13;
reach it. Regardless of the path chosen, successful implementation requires that many&#13;
instruments and institutions be in place. While different paths can be taken to expand coverage,&#13;
all paths involve implementation challenges. With that in mind, the World Bank launched the&#13;
Universal Health Coverage Studies Series (UNICO Study Series) to develop knowledge and&#13;
operational tools designed to help countries tackle these implementation challenges in ways that&#13;
are fiscally sustainable and that enhance equity and efficiency. The UNICO Studies Series&#13;
consists of technical papers and country case studies that analyze different issues related to the&#13;
challenges of UHC policy implementation.&#13;
The case studies in the series are based on the use of a standardized protocol to analyze the nuts&#13;
and bolts of programs that have expanded coverage from the bottom upâ&#128;&#148;programs that have&#13;
started with the poor and vulnerable rather than those initiated in a trickle-down fashion. The&#13;
protocol consists of nine modules with over 300 questions that are designed to elicit a detailed&#13;
understanding of how countries are implementing five sets of policies to accomplish the&#13;
following: (a) manage the benefits package, (b) manage processes to include the poor and&#13;
vulnerable, (c) nudge efficiency reforms to the provision of care, (d) address new challenges in&#13;
primary care, and (e) tweak financing mechanisms to align the incentives of different&#13;
stakeholders in the health sector. To date, the nuts and bolts protocol has been used for two&#13;
purposes: to create a database comparing programs implemented in different countries, and to&#13;
produce case studies of programs in 24 developing countries and one high-income â&#128;&#156;comparator,â&#128;?&#13;
the state of Massachusetts in the United States. The protocol and case studies are being published&#13;
as part of the UNICO Studies Series, and a comparative analysis will be available in 2013.&#13;
We trust that the protocol, case studies, and technical papers will provide UHC implementers&#13;
with an expanded toolbox, make a contribution to discussions about UHC implementation, and&#13;
that they will inform the UHC movement as it continues to expand worldwide.&#13;

&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia is one of many countries aiming to achieve universal health coverage for its&#13;
population. Several challenges remain to reaching this goal, which the country hopes to achieve&#13;
by 2019. Although health insurance coverage has increased significantly in Indonesia over the&#13;
last decade, almost 60 percent of the population still remains without any coverage, and out-of-&#13;
pocket spending remains high even among those with coverage. Further expansion of insurance&#13;
coverage is expected to be especially challenging since many of those currently not covered are&#13;
in the informal sector. In addition, ensuring access to quality health services remains an issue,&#13;
especially in rural, remote areas of the country.&#13;
&#13;
Jamkesmasâ&#128;&#148;a government-financed health insurance program for the poor and near-poorâ&#128;&#148;is&#13;
currently Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s largest insurance program. The program is expected to be integrated and&#13;
merged with all other social insurance programs under a single-payer umbrella by 2014.&#13;
Jamkesmas has been operational since 2005, and an assessment of its implementation can&#13;
provide valuable lessons for informing future policy initiatives aimed at attaining universal&#13;
health coverage. The program is centrally managed and financed by the Ministry of Health and&#13;
provides coverage to more than 76 million people. Although the program is designed with good&#13;
intentions, it is performing well below its potential in terms of attaining its outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
On the positive side, about 40 percent of poor and near-poor households are covered under the&#13;
program, outpatient and inpatient utilization rates have increased among program cardholders,&#13;
levels of catastrophic payments have declined, and there is generally a positive perception with&#13;
regard to the program among those who are enrolled. There is increasing participation of the&#13;
private providers under Jamkesmas, and more than 300 complementary local Jamkesmas-&#13;
inspired programs have been initiated across the country. On the negative side, there is evidence&#13;
of high levels of mistargeting and leakages to the nonpoor, low levels of socialization and&#13;
awareness of benefits, low utilization and relatively low quality of care, regional inconsistencies&#13;
in the availability of the basic benefits package, relatively shallow levels of financial protection,&#13;
and poor accountability and feedback mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
The architecture of Jamkesmas functions more like a demand-side â&#128;&#156;top-upâ&#128;? program rather than&#13;
a full-fledged insurance program. The programâ&#128;&#153;s reimbursements do not reflect the full cost of&#13;
services, since public providers still receive government subsidies in the form of salary payments&#13;
and capital investments. Supply-side constraints conceal the real costs of the Jamkesmas&#13;
program and serve as an implicit cost-management strategy. Although Jamkesmas offers a&#13;
comprehensive benefits package of services, in practice, utilization and the associated claims&#13;
reimbursements do not reflect the cost of health coverage due to limitations in the supply of&#13;
services. This combination of supply-side constraints and supply-side subsidies (the latter in&#13;
itself not necessarily a shortcoming) has not been leveraged to improve the programâ&#128;&#153;s overall&#13;
effectiveness and will likely impact its future sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
Improving the current performance of Jamkesmas will be key to attaining universal health&#13;
coverage in Indonesia. A greater separation between provider and purchaser functions and&#13;
implementation of better results-focused provider payment mechanisms would be necessary to&#13;
address weaknesses in the programâ&#128;&#153;s architecture. Targeting mechanisms need improvement, and&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   v&#13;
&amp;#12;this is an area where global experience and lessons from other countries could be beneficial.&#13;
Overall, the biggest challenges relating to the implementation of universal health coverage in&#13;
Indonesia are those related to ensuring supply-side readiness and the financial sustainability of&#13;
the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               vi&#13;
&amp;#12;1. Introduction&#13;
&#13;
This case study describes and assesses Jamkesmas, Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s government-financed health&#13;
coverage program for the poor and near-poor. The case study provides a detailed description of&#13;
the scope, depth, and breadth of coverage provided under Jamkesmas, and highlights ways in&#13;
which the program interacts with the rest of Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s health system. The study also&#13;
summarizes and discusses evidence on whether Jamkesmas is attaining its stated objectives of&#13;
removing financial barriers and improving access to health care by the poor and near-poor, what&#13;
could be improved, and what lessons can be learned from the experience of Jamkesmas that&#13;
could help inform Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s quest for universal coverage.&#13;
&#13;
The Jamkesmas program was started in 2005 as the Askeskin program for the poor. 2 In 2007, it&#13;
was renamed Jamkesmas and was expanded to also cover the near-poor. Jamkesmas currently&#13;
targets almost a third of Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s population (official estimates indicate that there are 76.4&#13;
million poor and near-poor beneficiaries). 3 The program is fully financed out of central&#13;
government revenues and is administered by the Ministry of Health. Jamkesmas has an annual&#13;
operating budget based on an estimated â&#128;&#156;premiumâ&#128;? rate of Rp 6,500 per person per month (about&#13;
US$8 per person per year), amounting to about a quarter of the central governmentâ&#128;&#153;s annual&#13;
health budget.&#13;
&#13;
Our analysis finds that Jamkesmas, although designed with good intentions, is performing well&#13;
below its potential in terms of attaining its outcomes. On the positive side, however, about 40&#13;
percent of poor and near-poor households 4 are covered under the program, outpatient and&#13;
inpatient utilization rates have increased among program cardholders, levels of catastrophic&#13;
payments have declined, and there is generally a positive perception with regard to the program&#13;
among those who are enrolled. Increasing numbers of private providers are enlisting under&#13;
Jamkesmas, and more than 300 complementary Jamkesmas-inspired local programs have been&#13;
initiated across the country. On the negative side, there is evidence of high levels of mistargeting&#13;
and leakages to the nonpoor, low levels of socialization and awareness of benefits, low&#13;
utilization and relatively low quality of care, regional inconsistencies in the availability of the&#13;
basic benefits package, relatively shallow levels of financial protection, and poor accountability&#13;
and feedback mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
The primary theme underlying the Indonesia case study is that supply-side constraints and&#13;
supply-side subsidies have not been leveraged to increase the effectiveness of the Jamkesmas&#13;
program. There are significant geographic deficiencies in the availability and quality of the basic&#13;
benefits package, especially for those living in relatively remote and rural locations of the&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
  The origins of health-insurance for the poor date to 2001, when the Fuel Tax Compensation Scheme (PKPS-BBM)&#13;
was established as a response to the end of the pro-rich government fuel subsidies, which were partly redirected into&#13;
programs to compensate the poor.&#13;
3&#13;
  The poor and near-poor equal roughly the bottom three economic deciles of the population. There are ongoing&#13;
discussions to increase the number of targeted Jamkesmas beneficiaries to 86.4 million in 2013.&#13;
4&#13;
  This is measured using the household consumption sections in the annual National Economic Survey (Susenas).&#13;
Consumption is adjusted for household size and district differences in the cost of living, and households are&#13;
classified into deciles of per capita consumption. For the purposes of this analysis, the lowest three deciles of&#13;
individuals in the survey are considered equivalent to the â&#128;&#156;poor and near-poor,â&#128;? that is, the population targeted by&#13;
Jamkesmas.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                   1&#13;
&amp;#12;country, and this limits the effective availability of benefits for many Jamkesmas beneficiaries.&#13;
In addition, the architecture of Jamkesmas is such that, in effect, it appears to function more like&#13;
a demand-side â&#128;&#156;top-upâ&#128;? of essentially a (constrained) supply-side system rather than a full-&#13;
fledged insurance program that reimburses the full cost of the provision of services. Jamkesmas&#13;
does not reimburse the full cost of care; salaries, capital, and some of the operating costs at&#13;
public facilities continue to be paid for by the government (central, provincial, or district,&#13;
depending on the type of public facility). Estimates suggest that these subsidies account for&#13;
upwards of two-thirds of the full cost of providing care under Jamkesmas. This combination of&#13;
supply-side constraints and supply-side subsidies (although in itself not necessarily a&#13;
shortcoming) has not been leveraged to improve the programâ&#128;&#153;s overall effectiveness and will&#13;
likely impact its future sustainability. One of the key aspects in attaining universal coverage in&#13;
Indonesia should be a greater focus on improving the current performance of Jamkesmas.&#13;
&#13;
The remainder of the case study is organized as follows. Section 2 provides general background&#13;
and information on health system outcomes in Indonesia. Section 3 is an overview of health care&#13;
financing and delivery. Section 4 describes the institutional architecture of Jamkesmas. Section 5&#13;
highlights the process of targeting, identification, and enrolment of beneficiaries under the&#13;
program. Section 6 focuses on the role of public financing. Section 7 outlines the basic benefits&#13;
package. Section 8 provides an overview of the information environment of Jamkesmas. Section&#13;
9 discusses the special theme of supply-side constraints and supply-side subsidies that dilute the&#13;
effectiveness of the Jamkesmas program. Section 10 discusses the pending agenda around some&#13;
of the architectural and operational features of Jamkesmas in the context of universal coverage.&#13;
&#13;
2. General Background and Health System Outcomes&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia is a geographically dispersed and ethnically diverse archipelago of 240 million people,&#13;
making it the fourth-largest country in the world based on population. It has a per-capita income&#13;
of about US$3,500 5â&#128;&#148;similar to that of Egypt and Georgiaâ&#128;&#148;and is classified by the World Bank&#13;
as a lower-middle-income country. Recent estimates indicate that about 18 percent of its&#13;
population continues to live below US$1 a day, and about half lives below $2 a day. The country&#13;
has enjoyed robust economic growth rates over the last decade, averaging over 5 percent per year&#13;
since 2000. Economic growth is projected to be strongâ&#128;&#148;6 to 7 percent per year over the next&#13;
three to five years.&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia has made impressive health gains over the last few decades. Life expectancy at birth&#13;
has increased from 45 years in 1960 to almost 70 years in 2010. The infant mortality rate&#13;
dropped from 128 per 1,000 live births to 27 per 1,000 live births, and the under-five mortality&#13;
rate has dropped from 218 per 1,000 live births to 35 per 1,000 live births over the same time&#13;
period (figure 1). The country is on track to attain the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for&#13;
under-five mortality, and its attainment of this indicator is about average for its income level&#13;
(figure 2). Recent data updates indicate that Indonesiaâ&#128;&#148;with a little more effortâ&#128;&#148;could&#13;
potentially also attain the Millennium Development Goal for maternal mortality, for which&#13;
Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s attainment is much lower than what might be expected for its income level (figure 2)&#13;
(WHO/UNICEF/UNFPA/World Bank 2012).&#13;

Despite significant progress, Indonesia faces several challenges in the health sector. Malnutrition&#13;
rates are particularly high in the country, and even more so when one controls for income. For&#13;
example, 35.6 percent of Indonesian children under age 5 are stuntedâ&#128;&#148;levels that are&#13;
comparable to those observed in poorer Sub-Saharan African countries. 6 There are large&#13;
geographic and income-related inequalities in inputs, outputs, and outcomes. For instance, infant&#13;
&#13;
6&#13;
 Indonesia has similar levels of underweight, wasting, and stunting as Cameroon, Sierra Leone, Togo, and Uganda,&#13;
among others (see UNICEF 2012).&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                                                                                              3&#13;
&amp;#12;mortality in provinces such as West Sulawesi is two to three times higher than in some of the&#13;
other provinces. Infant and child mortality rates among the poorest wealth quintile of households&#13;
are more than double that in the richest. Access remains a huge problem in remote districts, as&#13;
does quality of care. At almost 40 percent, the out-of-pocket (OOP) share of total health&#13;
expenditure remains high (figure 3). 7,8 Although household health insurance population coverage&#13;
rates have increased in the last decade or soâ&#128;&#148;from 15 percent in 1995 to more than 40 percent in&#13;
2010â&#128;&#148;almost 60 percent of the population still remains without any coverage, and OOP&#13;
spending remains high even among those with coverage.&#13;

Health insurance coverage among the poor and near-poor is only about 40.8 percent, most being&#13;
accounted for by Jamkesmas. Coverage rates tend to be highest among the richest economic&#13;
deciles and lowest among the middle-income groups in Indonesia (figure 4). Almost 60 percent&#13;
of uncovered households were headed by individuals working in the informal sector, 50 percent&#13;
of whom were in agriculture. Households spend about 2.1 percent of their total consumption on&#13;
health, ranging from about 1.6 percent for the poorest decile and 3.5 percent for the richest&#13;
(figure 4), which is relatively low compared to other countries with similar income levels. The&#13;
incidence of OOP health spending was heavily skewed toward the rich: about 30 percent of all&#13;
OOP health spending was incurred by the richest decile alone, and the top three deciles&#13;
accounted for more than 50 percent of total OOP health spending in the country. The bottom&#13;
three deciles accounted for less than 15 percent of total OOP health spending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7&#13;
  The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends out-of-pocket spending to be at most 15 to 20 percent of total&#13;
health expenditure, because only at those levels is the risk of impoverishment due to catastrophic health spending&#13;
generally found to be low (see WHO 2010).&#13;
8&#13;
  Household health expenditure in Indonesia is comparable to other countries in the region, and is even slightly&#13;
higher at 1.26 percent compared to the Philippines at 0.8 percent and Thailand at 0.7 percent, but is much lower&#13;
compared to Vietnam and Cambodia (Xu et al. 2003).&#13;

3. Health Care Delivery and Financing&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia has mixed public-private provision of health care services, with the public sector&#13;
generally taking the dominant role, especially in rural areas and for secondary levels of care.&#13;
However, private provision has been increasing rapidly in recent years. For the public sector,&#13;
provision is decentralized to the district level. The central government remains the dominant&#13;
source of overall financing of the health sector, but district governments have discretion over&#13;
how budgets are allocated and how much gets spent on health (Heywood and Harahap 2009;&#13;
Tandon 2009).&#13;
&#13;
Health service utilization rates are generally low in Indonesia. Analysis of the 2010 SUSENAS&#13;
survey indicates that about 14 percent of the population utilized outpatient care in the month&#13;
prior to the survey. Around 60 percent of outpatient visits occurred at private facilities (typically&#13;
clinics/midwives and nurses) and the remainder at public facilities, mostly at the primary care&#13;
level. SUSENAS data also show that the better-off used private facilities for ambulatory&#13;
servicesâ&#128;&#148;69.5 percent compared to 51.6 percent among the bottom three deciles (table 1). About&#13;
2.5 percent of the population utilized inpatient services in the year prior to the survey, almost 60&#13;
percent of whom used public hospitals and the rest used private care. 9 Public facilities continue&#13;
to dominate inpatient care, except for the top three deciles a larger proportion of whom use&#13;
private facilities for inpatient care.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9&#13;
 Utilization rates are generally very low in Indonesia. In Vietnam, by way of contrast, the inpatient utilization rate&#13;
was 8.1 percent in 2010, and in the Philippines, the rate was 4.1 percent in 2008. The WHO uses a benchmark of 10&#13;
percent, although this is skewed toward rates seen in Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                             5&#13;

&#13;
Basic primary health care is provided by the public sector via a network of health centers (known&#13;
as puskesmas), each serving a catchment area at the subdistrict level of about 25,000 to 30,000&#13;
individuals. Indonesia has over 9,000 puskesmas, and each is supposed to have at least one&#13;
medical doctor on staff. About a third of all puskemas also provide inpatient services. Primary&#13;
care is also provided by private doctors, including by 70 percent of doctors working at&#13;
puskesmas who practice privately after hours (the size of the private sector for basic health&#13;
services is difficult to estimate since there is no reliable provider recording system). In principle,&#13;
puskesmas are meant to provide referrals to secondary and tertiary public hospitals. However, in&#13;
practice, the gatekeeping and referral functions of puskesmas are not strong. There are no&#13;
penalties for self-referring to higher-level facility; patients can go directly to secondary or&#13;
tertiary hospitals and obtain services without puskesmas referrals (or simply obtain a referral&#13;
letter from the puskemas).&#13;
&#13;
Indonesia has 1,632 secondary-care hospitals, of which about 838 are private (BPS 2010; MoH&#13;
2011). There are an estimated 163,000 hospital beds in the country, with about 52,000 beds&#13;
managed by the private sector, implying about 0.7 beds per 1,000 population (which is much&#13;
lower than the global benchmark of 3 per 1,000). The ownership of tertiary hospitals is mainly&#13;
public. Indonesia has about 376 tertiary hospitals, some of which are centers of excellence (about&#13;
300 of the 376 total tertiary hospitals are public).&#13;
&#13;
One of the key supply challenges in Indonesia is the provision of health services in rural and&#13;
remote areas and in a dispersed archipelago of over 17,000 islands. The government is in the&#13;
process of upgrading puskesmas with inpatient facilities, especially in secondary towns and rural&#13;
locations. Allocations have been made to expand the number of third-class beds (by an additional&#13;
1,300 beds) by the end of 2012. The government has also allocated funds to expand inpatient&#13;
facilities specifically for maternal emergency-ready facilities, but this goal has not yet been&#13;
realized. In addition, there have been few systematic efforts to address challenges relating to&#13;
supply-side readiness, both in terms of improving the availability of basic medical equipment&#13;
and supplies and improving training of frontline health workers.&#13;
&#13;
Human resources for health (doctors, nurses, and midwives) are about 2 per 1,000 people, close&#13;
to the WHO benchmark of 2.3 per 1,000. The key issues in Indonesia are maldistribution and&#13;
relatively low levels of specialization. To provide incentives for doctors to work in remote,&#13;
underserved districts, the government provides higher salaries and benefits, as well as shorter&#13;
contracts (up to one year) to new graduates who serve in remote areas. For some areas, the&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    6&#13;
&amp;#12;incentives are as high as 250 percent of the base salary (Rokx et al. 2010). In addition, a stint as a&#13;
contract doctor in a remote, underserved area is given positive consideration for future&#13;
employment as a government civil servant. The program, however, is not compulsory. There is&#13;
also a government-run program of incentives for midwives to be based in remote, underserved&#13;
areas.&#13;
&#13;
Even before decentralization started in 2001, local governments were involved in the&#13;
management of social programs as a response to the 1997 economic crisis (for example, Social&#13;
Safety Net funds), which established local health-maintenance-organization-like bodies. These&#13;
schemes lasted for only one year due to insufficient capacity at the subnational level. However,&#13;
the involvement of subnational governments in some provinces and districts continued, even&#13;
though it was only limited to the targeting process and to the provision of additional coverage to&#13;
mitigate the withdrawal of the first fuel subsidy in the post-1998 political reform. In the&#13;
Askeskin/Jamkesmas program, the participation of subnational governments was initially limited&#13;
to identification of the poor and near-poor, and local governments had the task of ensuring that&#13;
the names and addresses of the beneficiaries matched the quota set by the central government.&#13;
Later, some local governments with strong fiscal capacity established schemes similar to&#13;
Jamkesmas, mainly to provide coverage to those identified poor or near-poor who were not&#13;
covered by the central program. The number of these local schemes, also known as Jamkesda,&#13;
increased significantly from less than 100 in 2008 to more than 300 by the end of 2011. These&#13;
schemes vary widely in terms of benefits and population covered, depending on the provincesâ&#128;&#153; or&#13;
districtsâ&#128;&#153; fiscal capacity.&#13;
&#13;
Figure 5 provides an overview of health financing and delivery in Indonesia. Indonesia spent 2.6&#13;
percent of gross domestic product on health, with total health expenditure (THE) per capita of&#13;
about US$77 in 2010. Public spending accounted for 41.1 percent of THE, and almost half of&#13;
public spending was at the district level. This level of spending is relatively low among countries&#13;
with comparable income levels. As mentioned, under Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s decentralized system, district&#13;
governments are responsible for the delivery of health services and therefore account for the&#13;
greatest share of government spending on health. The low public spending for health may be one&#13;
of the factors that leads to supply-side constraints. Private spending on health, although declining&#13;
in recent years, still accounts for 57.5 percent of THE. Household OOP payments continue to&#13;
represent a major component of health spending (40.5 percent of THE). Corporation and firm&#13;
health spending also contributed substantially, at 17.0 percent of THE. Hospitals account for&#13;
51.6 percent of THE , followed by providers of ambulatory care, which account for 21.0 percent&#13;
of THE.&#13;

Social security funds account for 7 percent of THE, and are used to finance the three major health&#13;
insurance schemes in the country: Jamkesmas, Jamsostek (the social health insurance program for&#13;
formal sector workers), and Askes (the social insurance program for civil servants). In many&#13;
provinces and districts, Jamkesmas is complemented (and sometimes substituted) by other local&#13;
health insurance schemes (Jamkesda).&#13;
&#13;
The remainder of the case study focuses specifically on Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s health coverage program for the&#13;
poor and near-poor, Jamkesmas.&#13;
&#13;
4. Institutional Architecture of Jamkesmas&#13;
&#13;
Jamkesmas is Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s government-financed health coverage program for the poor and near-&#13;
poor. As mentioned, the Jamkesmas program was initially started in 2005 as the Askeskin program&#13;
for the poor. In 2007, it was renamed Jamkesmas and was expanded to also cover the near-poor.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                             8&#13;
&amp;#12;near-poor. Jamkesmas currently targets almost a third of Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s population (official&#13;
estimates indicate 76.4 million poor and near-poor beneficiaries). The stated objectives of&#13;
Jamkesmas are to increase access to and the quality of health services for the poor and near-poor.&#13;
Jamkesmas cardholders and their families can, in principle, utilize primary care services at all&#13;
puskesmas and inpatient services (for third-class beds) at secondary and tertiary public hospitals&#13;
and selected enlisted private hospitals without any beneficiary contributions, benefit ceilings,&#13;
copayments, or balanced billing.&#13;
&#13;
There are five primary actors involved in the overall implementation of Jamkesmas. They are (a)&#13;
the National Task Force for Acceleration of Poverty Alleviation (TNP2K); (b) national&#13;
government ministries, including the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Health (MoH), and the&#13;
Ministry of National Development Planning (Bappenas); (b) provincial and district governments;&#13;
(d) public and enlisted private health care providers; and (e) the insurer/third-party&#13;
administrator. 10 Table 2 summarizes the roles and responsibilities of the five primary actors. One&#13;
additional actor (not listed below) is the Vice Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s Office, which has the mandate to&#13;
improve the implementation of various social assistance programs, including Jamkesmas.&#13;

&amp;#12;The program is fully financed out of central government revenues and is administered by the&#13;
MoH. A snapshot of the flow-of-funds under Jamkesmas is summarized in figure 6. Funds flow&#13;
from the Ministry of Finance to the MoH and then down to lower levels of government. The&#13;
MoH receives funds annually from the central government based on a current â&#128;&#156;premiumâ&#128;? of Rp&#13;
6,500 per person per month times the number of targeted poor and near-poor of 76.4 million. In&#13;
addition, central, provincial, and district governments provide input-based budget transfers to&#13;
puskesmas and public hospitals for salaries and infrastructure (these are not directly related to&#13;
Jamkesmas).&#13;

MoH reimburses hospitals for Jamkesmas coverage based on diagnostic-related groups (DRGs,&#13;
called INA-CBG). It is not clear, however, whether DRGs have helped contain costs and&#13;
improve efficiency. Reimbursement rates are the same for both public and private hospitals in&#13;
the network (although rates vary by the degree of specialization of the hospital). The basis for the&#13;
policy to use the same reimbursement rate for both public and private providers also remains&#13;
unclear. Prior to the program implementation, the government already had a policy that required&#13;
private hospitals to spare at least 10 percent of total beds for the poor. 11 The economic&#13;
justification for this is that private hospitals are expected to cross-subsidize poor patients from&#13;
their regular inpatient services.&#13;
&#13;
Payments to puskesmas were initially based on capitation. As of 2011, puskesmas are&#13;
reimbursed based on fee-for-service. District Health Offices (DHOs) receive an envelope of&#13;
funds from the central government via MoH based on a capitation payment of Rp 1,000 per poor&#13;

&amp;#12;and near-poor person per month. DHOs are reimbursed for puskesmas utilization based on fee-&#13;
for-service from this envelope. Any surplus or deficit of Jamkesmas-related financing at the&#13;
DHO-puskesmas level is adjusted by transfers to or from the local government treasury. Of total&#13;
program costs, about 75 percent are for reimbursement of hospital-based care, 20 percent are for&#13;
puskesmas-based care, and the remainder are for administrative costs. 12,13&#13;
&#13;
The failure of a capitation mechanism at the puskesmas level was mainly driven by the&#13;
inflexibility in the use of Jamkesmas funds at public health providers. In the absence of provider&#13;
autonomy, incentivizing primary care providers to focus on preventive efforts is difficult to&#13;
achieve. In addition, there is a government regulation that compels puskesmas to submit all their&#13;
revenues to the local treasury office but to only get part of them back. These factors combined&#13;
have led to low disbursement of the Jamkesmas funds for primary care. In 2011, it was estimated&#13;
that 50 percent of primary care service funds remained undisbursed. In addition, the shift to fee-&#13;
for-service is expected to ensure better data collection on the utilization of primary care facilities&#13;
that was not available with the use of capitation payment.&#13;
&#13;
At present, Jamkesmas funds are not pooled with those of any of the other social insurance&#13;
schemes operating in the country. As mentioned, Indonesia has two additional social insurance&#13;
schemes: Askes (for civil servants) and Jamsostek (for the private sector). In many provinces and&#13;
districts, Jamkesmas is complemented (and sometimes substituted) by other local government-&#13;
financed health insurance schemes (Jamkesda). These insurance schemes, however, are managed&#13;
and operated largely independently of each other.&#13;
&#13;
Jamkesmas is one manifestation of a landmark legislative commitment made by Indonesia in&#13;
2004 specifically to attain universal coverage. In addition, in 2011, the government enacted&#13;
another lawâ&#128;&#148;the Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial, or the BPJS lawâ&#128;&#148;which calls for the&#13;
merger and unification of Jamkesmas with all other existing social insurance programs by 2014.&#13;
The current for-profit administrator for the civil servants program, PT Askes, will be modified&#13;
and converted to BPJS Health, a not-for-profit administrator for all the social health insurance&#13;
programs in the country, and funds across the different insurance schemes will be pooled and the&#13;
benefits packages harmonized.&#13;
&#13;
5. Targeting, Identification, and Enrolment of Beneficiaries&#13;
&#13;
The target group for Jamkesmas includes all poor and near-poor households in the country.&#13;
Officially, the program targets nearly a third of the population of Indonesia, approximately 76.4&#13;
million. The poor and near-poor are identified by a combination of means testing and local&#13;
government eligibility criteria. In 2005, Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s national statistics agency, Badan Pusat&#13;
Statistik (BPS), conducted a National Poverty Census Survey (PSE05). BPS then used a proxy&#13;
means test with 14 asset indicators to identify eligible households, and then produced a list of&#13;
quotas for the poor and near-poor for each district. Districts validated and verified data from BPS&#13;
using various methods depending on the districtâ&#128;&#153;s preference (some districts conducted their own&#13;
&#13;
12&#13;
   PT Askes manages Jamkesmas membership and receives 1 percent of total Jamkesmas spending from the MoH at&#13;
the end of each year (see World Bank 2012b).&#13;
13&#13;
   Some of the administrative costs were borne by the MoH and subnational health offices budgets, and this was not&#13;
reflected in the Jamkesmas cost, hence the low administrative cost.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                               11&#13;
&amp;#12;surveys while others mobilized administrative personnel up to the village level, and other&#13;
districts used the list from BPS that only identifies the head of household). If the number of poor&#13;
and near-poor was greater than the BPS district allocation numbers, these individuals were&#13;
encouraged to enroll in the local health insurance scheme (Jamkesda), if available.&#13;
&#13;
In 2011, a new list of the poor and near-poor was formulated covering over 40 percent of all&#13;
households in Indonesia. This is being used as the basis for a unified registry of potential&#13;
beneficiaries for all social assistance programs from 2012 onward, beginning with Jamkesmas&#13;
and the national conditional cash transfer program. The poor, and near-poor, are now being&#13;
targeted on the basis of household per-capita consumption. This is done with a mixture of&#13;
geographic and proxy means testing methods. Proxy means testing indicators are collected on all&#13;
households, and these are used to generate a consumption estimate using standard proxy means&#13;
testing methods. The consumption estimate is used to select beneficiaries, but this is done on a&#13;
district-by-district basis, with a quota set for each district based on poverty rates from the&#13;
national socioeconomic survey.&#13;
&#13;
Enrolment in Jamkesmas is conducted by district-level health staff: households are identified as&#13;
eligible and then enrolled. In addition, enrolment is not mandatory, and there are no fees for&#13;
enrolment. Membership of the program, including issuance of membership cards, is managed by&#13;
PT Askes. However, enrolment is the responsibility of local governments. The enroller has some&#13;
flexibility since some of the criteria they use are discretionary and subjective. There is no&#13;
voluntary enrolment for the nonpoor and no official exit strategy under the program. Eligibility&#13;
so far has been indefinite. However, with the new targeting system being used to identify&#13;
beneficiaries from 2012 onward (and with a recertification of the entire database planned to be&#13;
available in 2015), a three-year recertification appears likely. It is currently unclear whether&#13;
previous beneficiaries will be able to use their old cards to receive health services, and how long&#13;
this situation will last.&#13;
&#13;
Jamkesmas targeting identifies eligible households, but membership is individual, with each&#13;
household member entitled to receive a Jamkesmas card. Qualitative and quantitative evidence&#13;
suggests that not all family members eligible to receive the card actually possess one. There are&#13;
some cases of Jamkesmas cardholders preferring not to use their cards and, instead, paying out-&#13;
of-pocket to avoid perceived stigmatization from health providers, and to avoid the generally&#13;
longer waiting times because of the need to complete additional administrative requirements.&#13;
Despite some reports of stigma, there remains a generally positive feeling about Jamkesmas&#13;
among enrollees (World Bank 2011).&#13;
&#13;
Evidence suggests that the leakages to noneligible beneficiaries are significant. Estimates from&#13;
the national socioeconomic survey in 2010 suggest that Jamkesmas coverage rates among poor&#13;
and near-poor households were about 34.6 percent. About 6.2 percent of the poor and near-poor&#13;
reported having other forms of insurance, and 59.2 percent reported no insurance coverage&#13;
whatsoever. On the flip side, 47.6 percent of Jamkesmas cardholders were poor or near-poor,&#13;
indicating a leakage rate of 52.4 percent (figure 7). One-fifth (20 percent) of all Jamkesmas&#13;
holders belonged to the top three economic deciles (figure 7).&#13;

&#13;
One reason behind the suboptimal performance of Jamkesmas in terms of targeting is likely due&#13;
to variation in the proxy-means-testing criteria used across districts, and to poor program&#13;
knowledge among the targeted beneficiaries. The criteria used to identify household&#13;
characteristics vary across districts; in some districts, village midwives and subdistrict health&#13;
center officials often distribute health cards according to their own criteria, regardless of&#13;
economic status (World Bank 2012c). There are no specific incentives in the system to either&#13;
maximize enrolment or minimize mistargeting. There is some anecdotal evidence and allegations&#13;
of fraud and political clientelism, but only a few cases have been reported. Since enrolment of&#13;
the poor and near-poor is not mandatory, there is some evidence that the target beneficiaries&#13;
enroll only when they need to use health services (that is, there is adverse selection). The list of&#13;
eligible beneficiaries compiled by district officials is not subject to validation from the central&#13;
government, resulting in mismatching, poor coverage, and leakage of health insurance benefits to&#13;
the nonpoor. Furthermore, poor and near-poor households that were denied the card despite&#13;
being eligible do not have a clear recourse.&#13;
&#13;
6. Public Financing of Jamkesmas&#13;
&#13;
Jamkemas has an annual operating budget based on an estimated â&#128;&#156;premiumâ&#128;? rate of Rp 6,500 per&#13;
person per month (about US$8 per person per year), totaling about a quarter of the annual central&#13;
government health budget. Jamkesmas is a central program and its budgetâ&#128;&#148;virtually all&#13;
Jamkesmas spending (around 99 percent)â&#128;&#148;is managed at the central level. A minor share is&#13;
executed by local governments and allocated to support supervision and monitoring activities.&#13;
&#13;
Table 3 summarizes Jamkesmas expenditure and revenue trends, along with enrolment and other&#13;
information during 2006â&#128;&#147;10. The initial 2006 budget for Jamkesmas (then called Askeskin) was&#13;
based on a cost per person per month of Rp 5,000, derived from preliminary actuarial estimates&#13;
and the experience of the civil servant insurance scheme, Askes. In the following years,&#13;
allocation adjustments were made based on expenditures of previous years.&#13;

&#13;
Jamkesmas premiums and expenditures are not reflective of the â&#128;&#156;trueâ&#128;? cost of provision of care.&#13;
Over two-thirds of the average cost of care under Jamkesmas is estimated to come from supply-&#13;
side subsidies at public facilities. Salaries, capital, and some of the operating costs at public&#13;
facilities continue to be paid for by the government (central, provincial, or district, depending on&#13;
the type of public facility), and these can range from 60 to 80 percent of the total cost of care at&#13;
public facilities (GIZ 2012). Acturial studies estimate the true cost at at least three to four times&#13;
the existing premium rate of Rp 6,500, even with existing levels of supply-side constraints&#13;
(Guerard et al. 2011). The magnitude of these numbers is consistent with the current estimated&#13;
public and private expenditure on curative and rehabilitative care of about US$40 per capita per&#13;
year, about five times the Jamkesmas premium (Soewondo et al. 2011).&#13;
&#13;
7. Jamkesmas Basic Benefits Package&#13;
&#13;
At least on paper, Jamkesmas offers a comprehensive benefits package that is more generous and&#13;
inclusive than that of other social insurance schemes in the country, including those of the&#13;
contributory civil servants health insurance program (Askes) and the program covering formal&#13;
sector employees (Jamsostek) (see table 4 for a comparison of the three major health coverage&#13;
schemes in Indonesia).&#13;

Note: a. Starting in 2012, Jamsostek expanded the benefits package to cover catastrophic cases, as well.&#13;
&#13;
The MoH and National Security Council (DJSN) are mandated to revise and set the benefits&#13;
package. Exceptions include cosmetic treatments, general check-ups, dental prosthesis,&#13;
alternative medicine, fertility treatment, and fertilization programs (in vitro, in vivo). There are&#13;
no caps on benefits provided to beneficiaries (on paper). Limitations apply for eyeglasses,&#13;
hearing aids, and mobility aids (wheelchair, tripod cane, and so forth). Jamkesmas beneficiaries&#13;
are entitled to coverage of drugs from specific formularies and receive generic versions of&#13;
medications. There is no copayment, coinsurance, or extra-billing or balance-billing allowed&#13;
under the program.&#13;
&#13;
The Jamkesmas provider network comprises mainly public facilities. At the primary level of&#13;
care, the program includes only puskesmas, while for referral services, both public and enlisted&#13;
private hospitals are included. The participation of private hospitals in the network has been&#13;
increasing; currently, 30 percent of Jamkesmas network hospitals are private. The reasons private&#13;
hospitals have joined the network are likely driven by the assurance of volume of patient&#13;
inflows; some private providers (which have large fixed costs and excess capacity) accept&#13;
Jamkesmas since, at the margin, benefits from partial-cost reimbursements can outweigh average&#13;
costs. Some private religious hospitals are not-for-profit and will also accept Jamkesmas patients.&#13;
In some cases, private hospital participation is mandated by local governments.&#13;
&#13;
In 2007, the use of services by Jamkesmas beneficiaries increased significantly, especially&#13;
inpatient services, while the program was budgeted historically based on the use of funds from&#13;
the previous year. 14 This caused a budget shortage, and MoH had to reallocate their budget in&#13;
order to pay hospital claims, which led to delays in paying hospital reimbursements. This&#13;
received wide media attention and led to some changes (movement of administration from PT&#13;
Askes to MoH) and cost-containment measures such as the introduction of a drug formulary and&#13;
DRG payments.&#13;
&#13;
In reality, however, the actual availability of the basic benefits package is limited, especially in&#13;
remote, rural locations of the country. We discuss this issue in more detail in section 10.&#13;
14&#13;
   The spike in inpatient service utilization was mainly due to program maturation (more became aware of the&#13;
programâ&#128;&#153;s benefits) and the absence of cost-containment measures (drug formulary, member verification, and so&#13;
forth).&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                   15&#13;
&amp;#12;8. Information Environment of Jamkesmas&#13;
&#13;
The program has improved utilization of services among the poor and near-poor, especially for&#13;
inpatient services. However, inpatient utilization rates remain low compared to other population&#13;
groups in the country, as does depth of coverage. Estimates from SUSENAS 2010 indicate&#13;
relatively high outpatient utilization rates of 16.1 percent among Jamkesmas beneficiaries, higher&#13;
than the outpatient rates reported by those under Askes (13.9 percent), Jamsostek (13.8 percent),&#13;
and among those without any insurance (12.4 percent) (table 5). Inpatient utilization rates among&#13;
Jamkesmas beneficiaries, however, are lower than those among Askes and Jamsostek&#13;
beneficiariesâ&#128;&#148;2.7 percent compared to 4.0 percent and 3.3 percent, respectivelyâ&#128;&#148;but higher&#13;
than those without any insurance (2.0 percent). Although OOP health spending per capita among&#13;
Jamkesmas beneficiaries was lower than among Askes, Jamsostek, or those without insurance,&#13;
OOP health spending as a share of total household consumption in Jamkesmas households was&#13;
no different from those without insurance (table 5). There is some evidence, though, that the&#13;
incidence of catastrophic expenditure is lower among Jamkesmas users than among other groups&#13;
(Bredenkamp et al. 2011).&#13;

&#13;
In general, the information environment in which Jamkesmas operates is weak. The MoH has the&#13;
responsibility to collect, review, and audit information periodically on utilization and claims&#13;
data, looking for outliers and potential abuse. Annual Jamkesmas reports are submitted to the&#13;
president every year. The hospital claims analysis has helped identify claim outliers and cases of&#13;
DRG upcoding. However, the program still focuses on analyzing information related to&#13;
budgetary allocations and aggregate utilization rates, but does not explicitly monitor or target&#13;
health or financial protection outcomes among beneficiaries. Information on utilization rates has&#13;
been used to increase premiums and improve provider payment mechanisms, but not to improve&#13;
or adjust other health care delivery mechanisms and to ensure improvements in health outcomes.&#13;
Some basic information about the program is available on the Jamksemas website, and some&#13;
social marketing material exists, including those used in print media, television, and the Internet.&#13;
Media coverage has helped to increase public awareness and has often been the trigger for the&#13;
government to take measures to improve program implementation.&#13;
&#13;
Key pieces of information that could be used to inform and improve the overall effectiveness of&#13;
the program are available from other stakeholders. GIZ (the German Society for International&#13;
Cooperation) and AusAid (Australian Government Overseas Aid Program) recently completed a&#13;
major costing study that provides information on actual costs of delivering health service. In&#13;
addition, the National Institute of Health Research and Development has completed the first-ever&#13;
facility census for Indonesia, analysis of which could be helpful in assessing differentials in the&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    16&#13;
&amp;#12;availability of the basic benefits package across the country. On insurance data and household&#13;
spending, the national socioeconomic survey, SUSENAS, collects some relevant data from&#13;
households annually. However, to date none of the above resources have been systematically&#13;
used or analyzed to improve the effectiveness of the Jamkesmas program.&#13;
&#13;
9. Supply-side Constraints and Supply-Side Subsidies&#13;
&#13;
The primary theme underlying the Indonesia case study is that supply-side constraints and&#13;
supply-side subsidies dilute the overall effectiveness of the Jamkesmas program. There are&#13;
significant geographic deficiencies in the availability and quality of the basic benefits package,&#13;
especially for those living in relatively remote and rural locations of the country, and this limits&#13;
the effective availability of benefits for many Jamkesmas beneficiaries. In addition, the&#13;
architecture of Jamkesmas is such that, in effect, it functions more like a demand-side â&#128;&#156;top-upâ&#128;?&#13;
of essentially a (constrained) supply-side system rather than a full-fledged insurance program.&#13;
Jamkesmas does not reimburse the full cost of care: salaries, capital, and some of the operating&#13;
costs at public facilities continue to be paid for by the government (central, provincial, or district,&#13;
depending on the type of public facility). Estimates suggest that these subsidies account for&#13;
upwards of two-thirds of the full cost of providing care under Jamkesmas. This combination of&#13;
supply-side constraints and supply-side subsidies reduces the programâ&#128;&#153;s overall effectiveness and&#13;
will likely impact its future sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
Supply-side constraints comprise all the factors that limit health care delivery at the point of&#13;
service, including the number of doctors, nurses, and midwives; the number of beds; medical&#13;
equipment and technology; medicine supplies; and other basic amenities. Given Indonesiaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
geography, supply-side constraints reflect not only shortages in overall numbers, but also in&#13;
distribution. Rural and remote areas are disadvantaged in that they not only have fewer health&#13;
facilities but also face the difficulties associated with the retention of health personnel, especially&#13;
doctors.&#13;
&#13;
There are inequities even in the availability of basic primary care services across the country.&#13;
There was an average of 3.79 puskesmas per 100,000 population in 2010. However, the ratio of&#13;
puskesmas per 100,000 in remote provinces is much higher; for instance, in the eastern part of&#13;
Indonesia, the ratios ranged from 8 to 12 per 100,000, and these facilities cover geographically&#13;
remote, difficult, and sparsely populated areas. In addition, private providers are less likely to be&#13;
available in these areas (figure 8).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    17&#13;
&amp;#12;                            Figure 8 Puskesmas Density by Province&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Analysis of the stock of human resources for health in Indonesia reveals a sharp shortage of&#13;
doctors. The ratio of doctors in Indonesia is 0.2 per 1,000, one of the lowest in the region. The&#13;
PODES 2011 survey (the village facilities survey) reported that 92 percent of puskesmas had at&#13;
least one doctor, which is similar to administrative data. However, more realistic estimates&#13;
suggest that as many as 2,250 puskesmas (around 25 percent of the total number) are without&#13;
doctors, most of these being in the more remote areas of the country (Kompas 2011). The&#13;
distribution of doctors is highly concentrated in the Java-Bali region (which accounts for around&#13;
65 percent of all doctors); fewer than 6 percent of doctors practice in the eastern part of the&#13;
country. There are wide variations in both human resources for health per capita and hospital&#13;
beds per capita across provinces (figure 9).&#13;
&#13;
              Figure 9 Beds and Human Resources for Health per 1,000, by Province&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              18&#13;
&amp;#12;Despite improvement in coverage and access to health services, the quality of services has&#13;
tended to be stagnant in Indonesia. The quality of health personnel remains a problem. Although&#13;
some improvements can be observed from comparisons between diagnostic vignettes from the&#13;
1997 and 2007 Indonesia Family Life Survey, the changes are marginal, and overall quality of&#13;
services remains low, with only around half of health workers responding correctly to standard&#13;
questions and procedural vignettes. Although based on several qualitative studies, the&#13;
satisfaction level among Jamkesmas cardholders with health services they received in general&#13;
was good. The most common complaints are related to services provided by nurses, waiting&#13;
time, and complex administrative requirements.&#13;
&#13;
Access to care is also constrained by the lack of basic amenities and medical equipment in&#13;
puskesmas and other health facilities. Analysis of the 2011 PODES survey indicates that 96.7&#13;
percent of puskesmas had electricity, 88.1 percent had a water source, 87.5 percent had a cold-&#13;
chain facility for the storage of vaccines, but only 36.4 percent had an incubator. In addition, the&#13;
recently completed facility census (RIFASKES) estimates that 73.3 percent of puskesmas in&#13;
urban areas had basic emergency obstetric services, but only 53.4 percent of rural puskesmas did.&#13;
The availability of medical equipment and diagnostic tools is variable across urban and rural&#13;
areas; preliminary RIFASKES data estimates indicate that few puskesmas had equipment close&#13;
to stipulated national standards, and only 5.9 percent of urban puskesmas and 6.4 percent of rural&#13;
puskesmas had more than 80 percent of the 56 ambulatory clinical devices available; around 10&#13;
percent of puskesmas had less than 20 percent. In terms of essential drugs, only around 60&#13;
percent of puskesmas both in rural and urban areas fulfilled 60 to 79 percent availability of 83&#13;
types of essential drugs, and only around 15 percent had 80 percent of the required drugs. Table&#13;
6 shows the availability of 6 of the 14 core medicines listed by WHO as one of the tracers for&#13;
service availability.&#13;

&#13;
There are also clear shortages of qualified doctors and specialist doctors at the secondary level of&#13;
service. Preliminary RIFASKES estimates from 10 provinces show that only 25 percent of type&#13;
D, 50 percent of type C, and 70 percent of type B public hospitals have trained doctors on staff&#13;
for emergency care. 15 For specialist care, the facility census shows that 20 to 30 percent of public&#13;
&#13;
15&#13;
  Ministerial Regulations 986/1992 classifies five types of public hospitals; Type A is the top referral hospital; Type&#13;
B is a provincial-level hospital that provides specialist and subspecialist services; Type C is district/regency&#13;
hospitals that provide at least four basic specialties (surgeon, internist, ob-gyn, and pediatrician); and Type D&#13;
provides, at a minimum, a general physician and dentist, but also has a transient status before it is upgraded to a&#13;
Type C hospital. Type E hospitals are special hospitals, such as mental hospitals, maternal and child hospitals, lung&#13;
hospitals, or heart/cardiac hospitals.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                   19&#13;
&amp;#12;hospitals were without one of four basic specialties (ob-gyn, pediatrician, internist, surgeon). It is&#13;
almost impossible for those living in remote and rural areas of the country to receive appropriate&#13;
first management of care at emergency units and to access basic specialized services at hospitals.&#13;
The availability of hospital beds is also low in the country. In terms of inpatient capacity,&#13;
Indonesia faced an estimated shortage of 13,875 beds. Some regions face particularly severe&#13;
shortages and have less than 50 percent of actual bed needs. Furthermore, hospitalsâ&#128;&#148;especially&#13;
district hospitalsâ&#128;&#148;face shortages of both human resources and medical devices/facilities.&#13;
RIFASKES estimates from 142 hospitals in 10 provinces indicate that 32 had no pediatric&#13;
specialist, 27 had no internist or surgeon, and 20 had no obstetrician. Regarding basic medical&#13;
facilities, only 64.8 percent of public hospitals had a 24-hour blood service, 65.5 percent had a&#13;
24-hour laboratory service, and 59.2 percent had a 24-hour radiology service.&#13;
&#13;
These supply-side constraints conceal the real costs of the Jamkesmas program and act as an&#13;
implicit cost-management strategy. Although Jamkesmas offers a comprehensive benefits&#13;
package of services, in practice, utilization and the associated claims reimbursements do not&#13;
reflect the actual cost of health coverage due to the limited supply of services. If the utilization&#13;
rates were higher, the actual costs of the Jamkesmas program would likely be much higher.&#13;
Furthermore, puskesmas and public hospitals continue to receive government subsidies for&#13;
salaries and capital, which are also not included in the overall cost of Jamkesmas and therefore&#13;
skew the perceived cost of the program.&#13;
&#13;
10. Pending Agenda: Attaining Universal Coverage in Indonesia&#13;
&#13;
One of the key aspects of attaining universal coverage in Indonesia should be a greater focus on&#13;
improving the current performance of Jamkesmas. This section summarizes the pending agenda&#13;
with regard to the different architectural and operational aspects of Jamkesmas, and the key&#13;
issues related to the theme of the case study highlighted in section 9. The ensuing issues are&#13;
discussed within the context of ongoing efforts to attain universal coverage in Indonesia, and&#13;
highlight some key problems with the current implementation of the program that prevent&#13;
Jamkesmas from fully attaining its objectives.&#13;
&#13;
Institutional Architecture of Jamkesmas&#13;
&#13;
Lack of results-focused provider payment mechanisms. Under Jamkesmas, payments to providers&#13;
are basically fee-for-service (including DRGs for hospital-based care). At present, there are no&#13;
additional incentives to improve quality and provider performance. More fundamentally, there&#13;
are no mechanisms to incentivize providers to attain population-level targets, for example, at the&#13;
district or catchment-area level (Langenbrunner and Somanathan 2011). Whereas the incentives&#13;
on the demand side (for beneficiaries) under the program are relatively clear, supply-side&#13;
incentives need to be better aligned and adjusted to ensure the program is attaining its objectives.&#13;
&#13;
Incomplete separation of purchaser and provider. Jamkesmas is currently housed within the&#13;
MoH, which is ultimately also responsible for overseeing and, along with local governments,&#13;
financing, public health facilities. This incomplete separation of provider and purchaser&#13;
functions under the program is problematic because it amplifies the lack of incentives for both&#13;
providers and purchaser to attain the intended policy objectives. In addition, management of&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   20&#13;
&amp;#12;Jamkesmas within the MoH is segregated by level of service, with each level belonging to a&#13;
different unit. These issues are exacerbated by insufficient MoH experience and capacity in&#13;
managing large-scale programs, leading to weak monitoring and poor feedback and&#13;
accountability mechanisms. The implementation of the Social Security Administrator Law&#13;
requires management of Jamkesmas to be transferred to a single not-for-profit social insurance&#13;
administrator by 2014. This may improve the situation with regard to some of the above-&#13;
mentioned problems. Discussions are ongoing regarding the transfer schedule and the readiness&#13;
and willingness of PT Askes to merge their existing provider payment mechanisms and&#13;
information systems with those of Jamkesmas.&#13;
&#13;
Targeting, Identification, and Enrolment of Beneficiaries&#13;
&#13;
Reducing mistargeting and leakages. Jamkesmas targeting of the poor and near-poor needs&#13;
significant improvements. More than half of Jamkesmas beneficiaries are not from the bottom&#13;
three deciles. As mentioned, the country is in the process of improving beneficiary identification&#13;
methods to improve coverage and reduce leakages. In expanding coverage to achieve universal&#13;
coverage, one of the most debated issues is expansion to cover the nonpoor informal sector.&#13;
According to global experience, other countries, such as Brazil, China, Mexico, and Thailand&#13;
have had difficulties covering this particular group. The debate involves discussions around the&#13;
level of premium contributions and collection mechanisms, both of which are expected to be&#13;
extremely challenging.&#13;
&#13;
Improving coverage rates. Jamkesmas needs to improve socialization, awareness, and&#13;
availability of benefits to ensure that all those eligible actually enroll in the program. Also,&#13;
currently the system does not incentivize local governments to enroll targeted beneficiaries. One&#13;
option would be for the government to tie some proportion of resource transfers to local&#13;
governments based on verified enrolment numbers rather than on a capitation and utilization&#13;
basis, as is currently the case. Active validation and enrolment of eligible beneficiaries of the&#13;
program would be a key aspect to maximize coverage and limit leakage.&#13;
&#13;
Public Financing of Jamkesmas&#13;
&#13;
Sustainability issues. Jamkesmas is entirely financed through central government taxes.&#13;
Premiums are not based on sound actuarial calculations. Supply-side constraints and supply-side&#13;
subsidies have given the false impression that financing of Jamkesmas is sufficient. The program&#13;
does not reimburse the full cost of services and relies heavily on supply-side subsidies.&#13;
Consequently, the program does not provide strong incentives to the providers to deliver high-&#13;
quality services. In addition, fund flows from the central levels to public health centers have&#13;
proven to be problematic in a decentralized setting, given conflicting and confusing financial&#13;
arrangements between central and local governments that have hampered health center use of&#13;
funds.&#13;
&#13;
Learning lessons from selected provinces/districts that have attained universal coverage. Some&#13;
provinces/districts in Indonesia have already expanded toward universal coverage. In looking at&#13;
issues related to public financing, it is imperative that the government examine these experiences&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               21&#13;
&amp;#12;and estimate costs of universal coverage from these provinces/districts and identify lesson&#13;
learned.&#13;
&#13;
Jamkesmas Benefits Package&#13;
&#13;
Ensuring supply-side readiness. As discussed in section 9, one of the biggest challenges facing&#13;
Jamkesmas is ensuring that the basic benefits package is uniformly available, especially to those&#13;
living in remote, rural areas of the country. Supply-side constraints, in effect, currently limit the&#13;
effective availability of benefits under the program.&#13;
&#13;
Coordination of benefits across different schemes. In many provinces and districts, Jamkesmas is&#13;
complemented (and sometimes substituted) by other local health insurance schemes (Jamkesda).&#13;
These schemes often provide coverage for the â&#128;&#156;uncovered poorâ&#128;? and, in some cases, additional&#13;
benefits and coverage for other population segments. These schemes vary widely in scope, from&#13;
those covering only primary care to those having a comprehensive benefits package. The future&#13;
of the more than 300 local health insurance schemes in the grand scheme of universal coverage&#13;
remains unclear, and there are ongoing discussions on this front. The variations in the benefits&#13;
packages provided by these schemes, reflecting in part the fiscal capacity and preferences of&#13;
local governments, pose a particular challenge with regard to harmonization of universal&#13;
coverage efforts. In addition, Indonesia is aiming to merge the three largest health insurance&#13;
schemes (Askes, Jamkesmas, and Jamsostek) under the management of a single not-for-profit&#13;
health insurance carrier beginning in January 2014. Challenges remain regarding unification of&#13;
the different benefits packages, premium rates, membership management mechanisms, and&#13;
provider payment mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
The plan to merge the existing social insurance schemes and Jamkesmas, as required by law, was&#13;
being discussed intensively within the government at the time this case study was being written.&#13;
A significant change made is that now the government aims to cover the whole population by&#13;
2019 instead of by early 2014. The social health insurance administrator, which will be operating&#13;
a health plan as a result of integrating two social health insurance schemes and the Jamkesmas&#13;
program, is still expected to be effective on January 1, 2014. Questions remain, however, on how&#13;
these three health coverage plans with different target population groups and varied benefits&#13;
packages and provider payment mechanisms will be operated under one administration. Also,&#13;
these plans have reporting responsibilities to different ministries and have different&#13;
organizational structures, the integration of which has raised issues on, among other things, the&#13;
new institutional arrangement and asset management. The ongoing interministerial discussion&#13;
will produce a government regulation that will serve as the legal basis for its operation. One area&#13;
that still needs to be thought through and defined, but which does not seem to receive much&#13;
attention, is the new role of MoH in providing oversight functions, especially in monitoring&#13;
performance in relation to achieving health objectives.&#13;

&amp;#12;The World Bank supports the efforts of countries to share prosperity by&#13;
transitioning toward universal health coverage (UHC) with the objectives of&#13;
improving health outcomes, reducing the financial risks associated with ill&#13;
health, and increasing equity. The Bank recognizes that there are many paths&#13;
toward UHC and does not endorse a particular path or set of organizational or&#13;
financial arrangements to reach it. Regardless of the path chosen, the quality of&#13;
the instruments and institutions countries establish to implement UHC are&#13;
essential to its success. Countries will face a variety of challenges during the&#13;
implementation phase as they strive to expand health coverage. With that in&#13;
mind, the World Bank launched the Universal Health Coverage Studies Series&#13;
(UNICO Studies Series) to develop knowledge and operational tools designed&#13;
to help countries tackle these implementation challenges in ways that are&#13;
fiscally sustainable and that enhance equity and efficiency. The UNICO Studies&#13;
Series consists of technical papers and country case studies that analyze&#13;
different issues related to the challenges of UHC policy implementation.&#13;
&#13;
The case studies in the series are based on the use of a standardized protocol&#13;
to analyze the nuts and bolts of 27 programs in 25 countries that have&#13;
expanded coverage from the bottom up, starting with the poor and vulnerable.&#13;
The protocol consists of 300 questions designed to elicit a detailed&#13;
understanding of how countries are implementing five sets of policies to&#13;
accomplish the following:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   Manage the benefits package&#13;
â&#128;¢   Manage processes to include the poor and vulnerable&#13;
â&#128;¢   Nudge efficiency reforms to the provision of care&#13;
â&#128;¢   Address new challenges in primary care&#13;
â&#128;¢   Tweak financing mechanisms to align the incentives of different stakeholders&#13;
    in the health sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The UNICO Studies Series aims to provide UHC implementers with an expanded toolbox.&#13;
The protocol, case studies and technical papers are being published as part of the Series. A&#13;
comparative analysis of the case studies will be available in 2013.&#13;

            The nuts and bolts of Jamkesmas -
            Indonesia's government-financed health coverage program
            for the poor and near-poor
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This case study describes and assesses
            Jamkesmas, Indonesia's government-financed health
            coverage program for the poor and near-poor. It provides a
            detailed description of the scope, depth, and breadth of
            coverage provided under Jamkesmas, and highlights ways in
            which the program interacts with the rest of
            Indonesia's health system. It also summarizes and
            discusses evidence on whether Jamkesmas is attaining its
            stated objectives of removing financial barriers and
            improving access to health care by the poor and near-poor,
            what could be improved, and what lessons can be learned from
            the experience of Jamkesmas that could help inform
            Indonesia's quest for universal coverage. The primary
            theme underlying the study is that supply-side constraints
            and supply-side subsidies have not been leveraged to
            increase the effectiveness of the Jamkesmas program. There
            are significant geographic deficiencies in the availability
            and quality of the basic benefits package, especially for
            those living in relatively remote and rural locations of the
            country, and this limits the effective availability of
            benefits for many Jamkesmas beneficiaries. The remainder of
            the case study is organized as follows. Section two provides
            general background and information on health system outcomes
            in Indonesia. Section three is an overview of health care
            financing and delivery. Section four describes the
            institutional architecture of Jamkesmas. Section five
            highlights the process of targeting, identification, and
            enrolment of beneficiaries under the program. Section six
            focuses on the role of public financing. Section seven
            outlines the basic benefits package. Section eight provides
            an overview of the information environment of Jamkesmas.
            Section nine discusses the special theme of supply-side
            constraints and supply-side subsidies that dilute the
            effectiveness of the Jamkesmas program. Section ten
            discusses the pending agenda around some of the
            architectural and operational features of Jamkesmas in the
            context of universal coverage.
