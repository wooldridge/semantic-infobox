                              Release of the Mining Sector Tranche&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.      On June 13, 2002, the Executive Directors approved an Economic Recovery Credit&#13;
(ERC) of SDR 360.4 million     to the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The ERC is an&#13;
integral part of the Bank's Transitional Support Strategy (TSS) discussed by the Board on&#13;
July 31, 2001, to assist the DRC in its economic and social recovery, in the context of the&#13;
Government's 2001-2003 Interim Reform and Growth and Poverty Reduction Program. The&#13;
Credit has one cross-sectoral tranche of SDR 328.4 million;    and two floating sectoral tranches,&#13;
which   support reforms in the forestry sector (SDR       12 million)    and the mining     sector&#13;
(SDR 20 million) respectively, and which can be released in any order when the related triggers&#13;
have been satisfied. The Credit was declared effective on July 3, 2002 following clearance of&#13;
arrears to IDA and IBRD, and the first tranche was then released. The forestry sector floating&#13;
tranche was releasedon February 14,2003.&#13;
&#13;
2.      This memorandum informs Executive Directors that the Mining Sector Floating Tranche&#13;
of SDR 20 million has been made available for disbursement. As provided in Section 3.01 and&#13;
Schedule 1 of the Development Credit Agreement, a series of consultations with the Authorities&#13;
have reviewed the progress achieved in implementing           the program. This memorandum&#13;
summarizes these reviews and reports on the actions taken by the Government. It concludes that:&#13;
(a) satisfactory progress has been achieved in the overall execution of the program; (b) the&#13;
macroeconomic policy framework for growth and poverty reduction is consistent with the&#13;
objectives of the reform program; and (c) all specific conditions pertaining to the release of the&#13;
Mining Sector Floating Tranche have been met.&#13;

                             Release of the Mining Sector Tranche&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       I.      Background&#13;
&#13;
1.      The DRC is gradually emerging from a decade of political         instability and conflict,&#13;
following decadesof mismanagement and collapse of the State under the regime of Mobutu Sese&#13;
Seko. A prolonged collapse of the state followed by civil conflict have led to the destruction and&#13;
decay of physical and social infrastructure and contributed to a death toll of between 1.5 and 3&#13;
million since 1997. Millions  have been displaced. Transport infrastructure collapsed, so markets&#13;
are no longer connected; in many parts of the country, farmers could no longer sell their surplus&#13;
while urban food prices were high. The dislocation of public administration created opportunities&#13;
for large fiscal evasion. The instability,    conflict, and ungovernability   have had regional&#13;
implications, with the involvement of seven foreign countries in the DRC conflict and the rebel&#13;
movements of Burundi, Rwanda, and Uganda operating from rear bases in the Congo. The&#13;
stabilization of the DRC is key to sustainable peacein the Great Lakes region.&#13;
&#13;
2.      In this environment, the Bank's Transitional Support Strategy discussed by the Board on&#13;
July 31, 2001, supports the government of the DRC's far-reaching program of economic reform&#13;
in preparation for sustainable growth and poverty reduction. Stabilization and recovery support&#13;
Congolese efforts toward national reconciliation and provide income-earning opportunities for&#13;
the poor. Proceeds of this Economic Recovery Credit (ERC) Cr. 3660-DRC, approved by the&#13;
Executive Directors on June 13, 2002, which is an integral part of the TSS, have provided funds&#13;
necessary to support DRC cash flow immediately after arrearsto the World Bank were paid and&#13;
have helped support the DRC's efforts to continue reengaging with the international financial&#13;
community and the economy's continued stabilization and rehabilitation. The end of the DRC's&#13;
non-accrual status with the Bank, which permitted the approval of this Credit, has also catalyzed&#13;
the resumption of assistance from several donors after a decade of interruption and has set the&#13;
stage for assistanceunder the enhancedInitiative for Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC).&#13;
&#13;
3.      The Government's economic reforms include fiscal stabilization; liberalization of prices,&#13;
interest rates, foreign exchange and gem trading; the adoption of new Acts governing activities of&#13;
the Central Bank, commercial bank and co-operative banking; new Codes for Mining, Forestry,&#13;
Investment and Labor; and implementation of a broad set of good governance and anti-corruption&#13;
policies. The investment, mining and forestry codes break with past practices and are intended to&#13;
significantly enhance transparency, aswell as including measures that will improve the country's&#13;
attraction to responsible private investors. In addition to supporting this ongoing program of&#13;
reforms, the Credit addresses some extremely urgent initial steps for the restructuring of the&#13;
mining giant G&amp;mines       and steps to prevent widespread destructive exploitation of the natural&#13;
resource patrimony in the lead-up to the new policy regimes that will limit such abuses in the&#13;
future.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                     II.      RECENTPOLITICAL AND SECURITY DEVELOPMENTS&#13;
&#13;
4.       Restoration     of  peace.  To address the alarming economic and social situation, the&#13;
government of President Joseph Kabila has been engaged in restoring peace, strengthening core&#13;
state institutions, correcting macroeconomic imbalances, and opening up the economy. The&#13;
stated commitment by the government to pursue peace and to undertake these reforms, as well as&#13;
its actions to date to achieve these objectives, have been well received by the international&#13;
community.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Strong    progress   has been  made in consolidating  the  peace process  over   the last few&#13;
months.    In line with the Lusaka accords of 1999, peace agreements were signed in Pretoria with&#13;
Rwanda (end-July 2002) and Uganda (early September 2002). Foreign armies supporting the&#13;
several parties to the conflict have withdrawn their troops. On November 11, 2002, Presidents&#13;
Kabila and Kagame of Rwanda agreed to extend the Pretoria agreement to allow for the&#13;
disarming and repatriation of ex-Rwandan Hutu soldiers.&#13;
&#13;
6.       Meanwhile, Phase III of the United Nations Observation Mission (MONUC) to the DRC&#13;
continues. The UN passed Resolution 1445 on December 5, 2002, raising the number of&#13;
peacekeeping forces committed to the MONUC from 5,500 to 8,700. This is expected to help in&#13;
filling the security vacuum that has emerged after the withdrawal of foreign troops, particularly&#13;
in the easternregion, with tragic human consequences.At the same time, the DRC is designing a&#13;
Demobilization, Repatriation, Resettlement and Reintegration program, supported by the UN and&#13;
IDA, to help ex-combatants, including child soldiers, to reintegrate themselves into society, and&#13;
the provision of assistanceto child soldiers has already begun. The DRC's own program will be&#13;
launched within the framework the Multi-country          Demobilization  and Reintegration Program&#13;
(MDRP) for the Greater Great Lakes Region (Report No. 23869 AFR), which was considered by&#13;
the Executive Directors of IDA on April 18, 2002. The MDRP is funded at US$500 million               of&#13;
which US$190 million has already been mobilized. IDA will be providing US$lSO million and&#13;
donors providing about US$350 million        in grants via a trust fund; about US$l20 million will&#13;
fund the DRC program.&#13;
&#13;
7.      In February/March 2003, there was an intensification of hostilities in Ituri (the northeast&#13;
of the country) that resulted in human rights violations. In its Resolution 1468 of March 20,&#13;
2003, the UN Security Council condemned these violations and reiterated that the perpetrators,&#13;
including military      officers, should be held accountable. The Council demanded that (i) all&#13;
governments in the Great Lakes region immediately ceasemilitary and financial support for all&#13;
parties engage in the armed conflict in the Ituri region; (ii) all parties to the conflict respect the&#13;
Lusaka ceasefire accord; (iii) all foreign troops, in particular those from Uganda, be immediately&#13;
withdrawn from the territories of DRC; and (iv) that Rwanda refrain from sending troops into&#13;
DRC. On April        9, the President of South Africa, Mr. Mbeki hosted a meeting between the&#13;
Presidents of the DRC, Uganda and Rwanda, where it was agreed that the MONUC                 observer&#13;
force should take over the positions abandoned by Uganda during their withdrawal. Since then&#13;
the situation has deteriorated. The lawlessness following the Ugandan withdrawal from Ituri has&#13;
led to ethnic massacres; as of early June 2003, France, Canada and South Africa are preparing to&#13;
intervene with peacekeeping forces following an appeal by the Secretary General.&#13;
&#13;
8.      On the political front, in October 2002, President Kabila reaffirmed before parliament his&#13;
commitment to the peace process and the implementation of the economic reform program&#13;
supported by the Bretton Woods institutions. On November 12, 2002, shortly after the releaseof&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the UN report on the illegal exploitation of natural resources in the DRC in both rebel and&#13;
government held areas,President Kabila suspendedthree cabinet members and three other senior&#13;
officials  (including the director of the public diamond mining company) who were named&#13;
specifically in the report. A Cabinet reshuffle took place on November 17,2002. This responseto&#13;
the UN allegations was universally welcomed at home and by the international community.&#13;
&#13;
9.       The Inter-Congolese Dialogue continued at meetings in Pretoria, hosted by South Africa's&#13;
President Mbeki, and resulted in the signature on December 17, 2002 by all stakeholders, of a&#13;
comprehensive and inclusive Agreement on peace and transition to a democratically elected&#13;
government within two to three years. On March 6, 2003, there was further significant progress&#13;
toward lasting peace, as agreement was reached on: (a) adoption of an interim constitution; (b) a&#13;
memorandum on the creation of a restructured and reintegrated army; and (c) arrangements to&#13;
ensure safety of the members of transition institutions        in Kinshasa. The Inter-Congolese&#13;
Dialogue was concluded on April 2, 2003 in Sun City, South Africa, and was followed by the&#13;
nomination     of the all-inclusive transition government, containing four vice-presidents, 36&#13;
ministers and 25 vice ministers. This government was due to take office in May 2003 and most&#13;
of its members are in Kinshasa, but the transition has been postponed due to continued political&#13;
discussions regarding control of the armed forces.&#13;
&#13;
                            III.   RECENTECONOMICDEVELOPMENTS&#13;
&#13;
10.      With respect to economic reform, the government implemented a heavily front-loaded&#13;
economic reform program, covering the period from June 2001 to March 2002 and monitored by&#13;
IMF staff, with the main objectives of eliminating hyperinflation, liberalizing the economy and&#13;
initiating major structural reforms. This program was satisfactorily completed, and paved the way&#13;
for a three year arrangement in the amount of SDR 580 million under the Poverty Reduction and&#13;
Growth Facility (PRGF), approved by the Executive Directors of the International Monetary&#13;
Fund (IMF) on June 12, 2002. IMF Board completed the first review of the program on March&#13;
24,2003, which led to the release of the second tranche of the PRGF (SDR 26.7 million).l&#13;
&#13;
Performance under the PRGF-supported          Program&#13;
&#13;
11.      Through end-December 2002, overall performance under the PRGF-supported program&#13;
continued to be satisfactory, with good progress on the structural front. For the first time in&#13;
thirteen years, economic growth was positive (about 3 percent) and has resumed across all&#13;
sectors, except for manufacturing which continues to stagnateat best.&#13;
&#13;
12.      Fiscal developments. The IMF first review under the PRGF (Document EBS/03/12,&#13;
February 5, 2003) reported that overall fiscal performance was in line with program objectives&#13;
through end December 2002. Total revenue (excluding grants) at end- December exceeded the&#13;
target by 10 percent. Total expenditure remained lower than envisaged, the sharp increase in&#13;
sovereign and security expenditures related to the convening of the Sun City peace negotiations&#13;
in 2002 being more than offset by shortfalls in domestic and foreign-financed investments and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1    Waivers were granted for non-compliance with (a) the performance criterion pertaining to&#13;
     net credit to government, (b) the structural performance criteria concerning the liquidation&#13;
     of three public sector banks, and (c) the structural benchmark pertaining to the adoption of&#13;
     the Code of Conduct for civil servants; all criteria were met but with delays.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
social expenditures. At the same time, the planned shift in the composition of expenditure toward&#13;
pro-poor spending has yet to materialize (social expenditures only accounted for 7 percent of&#13;
government primary expenditures at end-September, instead of a target of 15 percent (for the&#13;
whole year), while the combined share of defense, security, and institutions          (mainly the&#13;
presidency) amounted to about 50 percent. This share remains above its target level because of&#13;
the emerging need to fill the security vacuum left by the withdrawal of foreign troops as well as&#13;
higher-than-expected expenditures related to the peaceprocess.&#13;
&#13;
13.     However, expenditures accelerated in October/November, causing an increase in inflation&#13;
and a depreciation of the exchange rate. Corrective measures were immediately taken which&#13;
brought the program target back on track. The government met end year targets, except for an&#13;
end-December 2002 inflation      rate of 15 percent compared with the 13 percent originally&#13;
projected, and is much less than the 135 percent rate reported at end-2001.&#13;
&#13;
14.     On the external side, the current account balance, including grants and debt relief,&#13;
turned from a deficit of 4.7 percent of GDP in 2001 to an expected small surplus in 2002 owing&#13;
to the impact of the exceptional terms of the September 2002 Paris Club agreement, as well as a&#13;
14 percent increase in export volumes, most notably in the copper and diamond industries and&#13;
despite a substantial decline in cobalt prices. These changes counterbalanced rising capital-good&#13;
imports, with substantial investments in the mobile telephone sector. The capital account is also&#13;
estimated to have shifted from a deficit in 2001 to a surplus in 2002 on account of sharp&#13;
increases in official  assistance and in direct investment. Official   foreign exchange reserves&#13;
increased to 4.2 weeks of imports, as compared to a target of 6.2 weeks.&#13;
&#13;
15.     The foreign exchange market has functioned satisfactorily since the liberalization       of&#13;
foreign exchange regulations in February 2001 and the unification        of the foreign exchange&#13;
market in May 2001. The real effective exchange rate was relatively stable during the first part of&#13;
2002, but then depreciated sharply, with an overall annual depreciation of about 58 percent. IMF&#13;
staff note that the Central Bank rarely intervenes in this market, and when it does it limits its&#13;
intervention to relatively small amounts; private capital flows have not increased, and may not&#13;
increase until the peaceprocess has concluded.&#13;
&#13;
            IV.      PROGRESSUNDERTHE       ERC FINANCEDADJUSTMENTPROGFUM&#13;
&#13;
A.      Overview&#13;
&#13;
16.     The ERC supports broad reforms in forestry, mining,           public  enterprise, finance,&#13;
governance and anti-corruption, described in the Government's Letter of Development Policy&#13;
(Appendix 2 of the MOP). Implementation of the LDP has been satisfactory. The government has&#13;
successfully initiated and maintained a macroeconomic policy framework for growth and poverty&#13;
reduction that, notwithstanding (i) higher than programmed net credit to government, (ii) lower&#13;
accumulation of foreign reserves by the Central Bank and (iii) slightly higher inflation than&#13;
programmed at end-December 2002, and delays in adoption of two structural reforms, is&#13;
consistent with the objectives of the reform program. The remainder of the present memorandum&#13;
concentrates on developments in the mining sector. Details pertaining to the other aspects of the&#13;
Program supported by this ERC may be found in the Annex.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B.       Mining&#13;
&#13;
17.      The Democratic Republic of Congo used to be an important producer of copper, cobalt,&#13;
diamonds, gold and other base metals. Historically, mining accounted for 25% of the country's&#13;
gross domestic product, 25% of total budgetary revenues and about three-quarters of total export&#13;
revenues. It provided 7% of employment.&#13;
&#13;
18.      Starting in 1985, DRC's mining industry entered a phase of steep decline that led to the&#13;
collapse of production for most mineral commodities. Reasons for the dismaying performance of&#13;
the sector include: (i) a legal and economic environment hostile to the development of private-&#13;
sector-led mining operations; (ii) institutional disorganization; (iii) poor governance and the&#13;
weakness of the regulatory institutions in charge of the sector; and (iv) the huge financial losses&#13;
of state-owned enterprises, associated with an excessive tax burden that prevented them from&#13;
renovating plant and equipment.&#13;
&#13;
19.      Gecamines, DRC's biggest largest state-owned mining           enterprise, was formerly the&#13;
world's first producer of cobalt and a leading producer of copper, as well as the country's first&#13;
provider of foreign exchange revenues, with more than US$ 1 billion              per year. As such,&#13;
Gecamines was a major contributor to the national budget, with more than US$ 100 million per&#13;
year. In spite of its mineral wealth, Gecamines is today in technical and financial bankruptcy, as&#13;
shown by: (i) old equipment and abyssal productivity; (ii) high production costs that translate&#13;
into substantial operating losses; (iii) 23,400 employees that have not been paid for more than 12&#13;
months; and (iv) debt of about US$ 1.4 billion dollars and arrears to most state-owned utilities.&#13;
Moreover, the company is tangled in a multitude of joint venture agreements (the majority of&#13;
them non-operational), logistic contracts and supply agreements that substantially reduce its&#13;
ability to operate.&#13;
&#13;
20.      Gecamines unpaid workers pose a significant social risk to the both the current and&#13;
incoming governments in a key Southeasternprovince parts of which have been at the center of&#13;
the recent conflict. The possibility of a voluntary separation program for unpaid and inactive&#13;
workers has elicited enthusiastic support from the workers and their unions, as well as from the&#13;
Government, which faces the beginnings of social unrest in this important region. Unambiguous&#13;
voluntary severance coupled with an agreed severancepackage would provide a basis for many&#13;
Gecamines workers to break cleanly with the company and seek other opportunities. Further,&#13;
given the dominant position of Gecamines in the DRC mining industry and its once significant&#13;
fiscal contribution, its present condition of bankruptcy and the uncertainty surrounding the&#13;
resolution of its problems effectively serve to deter new investments in the mining industry, and&#13;
impose a severeconstraint on the Government's ability to increase revenue collection.&#13;
&#13;
21.      For these reasons, the Government requested, and the Bank agreed to, the inclusion in&#13;
the ERC of a floating "mining      sector" tranche to finance the cost of voluntary    separation of&#13;
part of the workforce     of GCcamines, as an urgent first step towards restructuring the company&#13;
and stabilizing the situation in the mining sector. In spite of the current problems, the Democratic&#13;
Republic of Congo remains one of the most promising countries in the world in terms of mineral&#13;
potential. Given a conducive investment climate, DRC could over the next ten years return to its&#13;
historical levels of mineral exports commodities of more than US$l billion           per annum and&#13;
significant tax contributions.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22.     The objective of the ERC in the mining sector is to create the foundation for improved&#13;
governance in the management of mineral resources in DRC; and to increase the contribution of&#13;
the sector to the country's reconstruction and economic growth on a socially and environmentally&#13;
sustainable basis. The key building blocks are (i) reforming the legal and regulatory framework,&#13;
and (ii) enterprise level reform. The enterprise reform of greatest urgency concerns the collapsed&#13;
copper sector parastatal, Gecamines, the largest employer and provider of social services in&#13;
Katanga. A strategy for the still-operational       diamond producing parastatal MIBA         will be&#13;
developed as part of more general parastatal reforms under preparation.&#13;
&#13;
23.     Reform of the Legal and regulatory Framework.            The new Mining Code was drafted&#13;
by the Ministry of Mines and Hydrocarbons through a wide consultative process that involved&#13;
the participation of other ministries, civil society, private sector and the international community.&#13;
After two National Seminars held in Kinshasa on February 2000 and April 2002, the draft Code&#13;
was endorsed by the Economic and Financial Committee of the Government, then submitted to&#13;
Parliament, which approved it on June 2002. The Code was promulgated by the President and&#13;
published in the Official     Gazette on July 11, 2002. The new Mining             Code ensures full&#13;
transparency in the accessto mineral resources (e.g., allocation of permits), reduces Government&#13;
discretion, promotes the disclosure information, and ensures a non-discretionary treatment of all&#13;
operators. IDA    considers the Code to be an adequate basis for ensuring the sustainable&#13;
development of mineral resources, promoting a fair distribution of revenues between the State&#13;
and the private investors and sustainable economic growth. The new mining regulations were&#13;
finalized in January 2003 and were promulgated in March 2003 (Decree 038/2003, published in&#13;
the Official   Gazette on March 26, 2003). The approval of the Decree creating the Mining&#13;
cadastre and the Commission for the Validation           of Mining  Titles effectively concludes the&#13;
reform of the legal and regulatory framework for mining supported by the Program.&#13;
&#13;
24.     The new Code also introduces a standard, non-negotiable fiscal regime applicable to all&#13;
investments that provides for sharing revenues from the mining royalties and the surface rental&#13;
fees with provincial governments and local communities. This measure is in line with emerging&#13;
best practice regarding the development of local management, promotion of local economic&#13;
development and mining sustainability. Part of the financial contribution to the national budget&#13;
would be invested in the creation of mineral resource management instruments and institutional&#13;
capacity building.&#13;
&#13;
25.     Restructuring     of   GCcamines.     The    restructuring   of   Gecamines    is  proceeding&#13;
satisfactorily.  The program for the voluntary departure of 9,240 redundant staff has been&#13;
prepared with the assistance of an international expert funded under an IDF grant, has been&#13;
agreed to by the Company's management and unions, and approved by the Economic and&#13;
Financial Committee of the Government (ECOFIN) on March 11,2003. The Bank reviewed the&#13;
plan and considered it satisfactory. The program will begin as soon as the implementation&#13;
arrangements have been finalized. To this end, the President approved a decree (Decree&#13;
03Y2003) creating the Committee for the Restructuring of G&amp;mines              on March 18, 2003. An&#13;
international consultant has been hired under the Emergency Early Recovery Project, financed by&#13;
an IDA Grant, (Grant No. HO050 signed August 10, 2001) to prepare a global strategy for the&#13;
restructuring of Gecamines. A report outlining an overall strategy for restructuring the company&#13;
was submitted in April      2003, and Bank staff believes that it lays the basis for a sound&#13;
restructuring of G&amp;mines.     The government approved it in May. An international consultant has&#13;
also been hired under the Emergency Trust Fund to prepare an environmental audit for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Gecamines, and a final report was submitted in April        2003. The Bank has reviewed with&#13;
Government and the Consultant the main conclusions of the preliminary version of the report; the&#13;
final is still being reviewed by Government, but IDA staff consider it to be of good quality,&#13;
alerting for some huge environmental liabilities   in Gecamines core operations and proposing&#13;
solutions for their remediation.&#13;
&#13;
26.     Impact of ERC reforms. By setting concrete, immediate and clearly defined objectives,&#13;
the ERC       gave the Government an opportunity       to demonstrate its commitment      to the&#13;
establishment of a transparent legal and regulatory framework in order to improve governance in&#13;
the management of mineral resources. In addition, the mining component of the Economic&#13;
Recovery Credit opened the way for the comprehensive restructuring of Gecamines, the sector's&#13;
biggest state-owned company and the cornerstone of the economy of the Katanga Province.&#13;
Achievements have been satisfactory throughout the twelve months during which the mining&#13;
component of the ERC has been designed and implemented. The government intends to solidify&#13;
and follow up on these achievements through capacity building measures and further sector&#13;
reforms, with support from IDA and donors.&#13;
&#13;
27.     Continued    implementation    of ERC reforms in the future. The implementation of&#13;
ERC-supported reforms in the mining sector will continue to be supported by IDA through the&#13;
proposed Private Sector Development and Competitiveness Project (PSDC), scheduled to be&#13;
submitted to the Board in July 2003. The PSDC will support capacity building at the government&#13;
level for the enforcement of the new Mining Code, the on-going restructuring of Gecamines and&#13;
a further social safety net for the G&amp;mines       workers choosing to leave the company, The&#13;
Government      has also requested IDA     to consider further support for natural resources&#13;
management and governance to help, inter alia, with consolidation and deepening of the reform&#13;
agendaand the restructuring of Gecamines.&#13;
&#13;
       V.       CONDITIONSFORRELEASEOFTHEMININGSECTORFLOATINGTRANCHE&#13;
&#13;
28.     The Development Credit Agreement states that three general conditions must be met at&#13;
the moment of the ERC mining tranche release: (i) the macroeconomic policy framework for&#13;
growth and poverty reduction must be consistent with the objectives of the program; (ii) progress&#13;
in the implementation     of the overall program must be satisfactory; and (iii)     the specific&#13;
conditionality with respect to the Mining sector must be satisfied.&#13;
&#13;
29.     Overall   execution of the ERC Program.       The macroeconomic policy framework is&#13;
satisfactory and program execution is satisfactory as evidenced by (1) the completion of the first&#13;
review of the PRGF program by the IMF Executive Board, including the acceptance of waivers&#13;
for the performance criterion pertaining to net credit to government and for minor delays in&#13;
meeting some structural benchmarks, and satisfactory progress under the economic program&#13;
described in paragraphs 16-21 of the LDP; (2) satisfactory and timely progress in implementation&#13;
of sectoral elements of the ERC financed program described in LDP paragraphs 22-32; and (3)&#13;
continuing Government commitment to the natural resource sector reforms described in the LDP&#13;
paragraphs 33-44 and supported by the ERC. The effectiveness and forestry tranche releases&#13;
under the ERC have complied with the terms of Paragraph 3 of Schedule 1 of the DCA.&#13;
Implementation progress in other sectors is described in the Annex to this memorandum.&#13;
&#13;
30.     Mining    Sector Reform.   Progress in the carrying out of the Mining     Sector Reform&#13;
Program is satisfactory, as documented in the preceding paragraphs.&#13;

&#13;
         (d) an original letter from the Minister of Plan confirming the content of the Voluntary&#13;
                 Departure Program at G&amp;mines         approved by the Government on March 11,&#13;
                 2003, which was sent to the Association on April 12,2003.&#13;
&#13;
33.      The decreesmentioned in paragraph 32 were submitted to the Bank for comments prior&#13;
to their adoption, and are considered to be satisfactory They are in line with Government's policy&#13;
for the sector and the broad principles of the new Mining Code. They represent indispensable&#13;
milestones for the enforcement of the transparent management of mining permits and for the&#13;
coordination of Gecamines' restructuring process. The letter from the Minister of Plan confirms&#13;
the content of the program as discussed with the Bank and requests additional assistancefrom the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2    The LDP (para 33) states: "The government is currently reforming the legal and regulatory&#13;
     framework of the mining sector. A new mining code has been elaborated since 1998 and was&#13;
     submitted to Parliament in April 2002. The government has declared a moratorium on new&#13;
     mining concessions while awaiting the adoption of the new mining code. Next steps up to&#13;
     the end of December 2002 are as follows: Promulgation of the new mining code; preparation&#13;
     and adoption of new mining regulations; creation of a commission to validate mining titles;&#13;
     publication of a complete list of mining titles granted since 1995; publication of a complete&#13;
     list of mining titles that have been confirmed, contested or abandoned; and establish by&#13;
     decree a new mining cadastre as an administratively and financially autonomous agency."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
proposed Private Sector Development Competitiveness project to finance the total cost of the&#13;
program of US$40 million.     This project is scheduled for Board presentation in July.&#13;
&#13;
34.     Over and above the preceding legal obligations, fiduciary arrangements have been made&#13;
to ensure that (i) Gecamines staff who will be the beneficiaries of the departure packages are&#13;
properly identified; (ii) payments are made in full by an independent payment agency and only to&#13;
eligible beneficiaries; and (iii) following  IDA disbursements to a special account in BCC's&#13;
account at BIS, funds flow to the to the payment agency in a timely manner and appropriate&#13;
amounts. A memorandum of understanding between the Ministry           of Finance and the Central&#13;
Bank has been signed to regulate the disbursement of the funds. The Banque Commerciale du&#13;
Congo (BCDC) has been selected by the Ministry of Finance to execute the payments in the&#13;
cities of Lubumbashi, Likasi,     and Kolwesi.    A subsidiary Memorandum        of Understanding&#13;
between the Central Bank and BCDC has been signed stipulating the financial conditions and the&#13;
management procedures of the payments. IDA has seen a copy of the draft memorandum.&#13;
Supervision of the disbursements will be conducted by the Bank-supported independent Central&#13;
Coordinating   Office,   BCECO,    on behalf of the Ministry    of Finance. BCECO       has hired&#13;
internationally reputed independent auditors to do an ex-ante review of the list of beneficiaries&#13;
prepared by Gecamines, and another consultant is in the process of being hired to do an ex-post&#13;
audit of the payments. BCECO has established a branch in Katanga Province to monitor the&#13;
disbursements and make identity controls of all beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
VI.     CONCLUSIONANDRECOMMENDATION&#13;
&#13;
35.     All conditions for the release of the Mining Floating Tranche of the Economic Recovery&#13;
Credit   have been met. Overall       execution of the program is broadly satisfactory. The&#13;
macroeconomic framework is consistent with the objectives of the program. The Government of&#13;
the Democratic Republic of Congo has therefore been advised that the Mining Sector Floating&#13;
Tranche, in an amount of SDR 20 million is now available for disbursement.&#13;

&#13;
                                           Introduction&#13;
&#13;
 1.      As indicated in the text, this Annex reports on progress in: (a) forestry, (b) governance&#13;
and anti-corruption, (c) public finance management, (d) private sector development and public&#13;
enterprise reform, and (e) the financial sector.&#13;
&#13;
                                          A.     Forestry&#13;
&#13;
2.       Achievements under the ERC Forestry Floating Tranche. As indicated in paragraph 1,&#13;
the forestry floating   tranche was released in February 2003. The forest code that was&#13;
promulgated in August 2002 as part of the ERC-agreed measures offers a sound foundation to&#13;
further sector reform    and development. In keeping with         the new forest code, relevant&#13;
implementation texts need to be established to ensure transparency in the award of concessions&#13;
as foreseen by the new Code. In the meantime, some measures were taken to prevent short-term&#13;
rent seeking behaviors by investors and other actors in the logging business. These measures&#13;
included reviewing the validity of all recorded forest concession agreements (291) of which 143&#13;
covering 25 millions hectareswere abrogated due to noncompliance or term expiration.&#13;
&#13;
3.       Developments since February 2003. In the February-April 2003 period, the Government&#13;
launched a comprehensive forest sector review covering the initial      stage of a forest taxation&#13;
reform. This reform aims explicitly      at improving   forest conservation and sustainable use,&#13;
enhancing sector governance and increasing forest-based revenues to the government and local&#13;
communities. The ongoing forest sector review adopts a participatory approach and involves&#13;
consultation with the private sector and civil society. Once endorsedby government, the findings&#13;
of this review will be used to inform relevant implementation decrees of the new Forest Code&#13;
and future finance laws and budget processes.&#13;
&#13;
4.       The record of the past 15 months and the quality of dialogue with the Government on&#13;
forest sector development provide strong signs that DRC is committed to and capable of&#13;
politically sensitive and technically complex reforms in the sector. It also shows that external&#13;
support is key to keeping the reform process moving in the right direction. Nevertheless, forest&#13;
sector improvements     achieved in the past year are only first steps towards good sector&#13;
governance and long-term environmental and economic sustainability.           Important ancillary&#13;
measures initiated in parallel with the ERC forest measures are still to be completed. These are:&#13;
(a) the publication of the list of valid forest concession agreements; (b) the establishment of a&#13;
joint program by the Ministry of Environment and the Ministry of Finances and implementation&#13;
modalities to securethe collection of forest royalties.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                     B.       Reducing corruption    and improving    governance&#13;
&#13;
5.       The I-PRSP consultations revealed that civil        society considers conflict,   corruption,&#13;
economic mismanagement, and the woefully inadequate level and quality of public services to be&#13;
among the principal causes of poverty in DRC. In this context, two workshops followed by a&#13;
high-level seminar on governance where held by the Ministry             of Plan and Reconstruction&#13;
together with the Ministry of Justice, with follow-on by the Ministry of Economy, Finance and&#13;
Budget with the support of the World Bank Institute in August/September 2002. Building on the&#13;
results thereof, an anti-corruption strategy and action plan was adopted by the Council of&#13;
Ministers in November 2002.&#13;
&#13;
6.       The anti-corruption strategy has four strategic axes: (i) the establishment of a credible&#13;
legal regulatory and institutional framework to combat corruption; (ii) the implementation of&#13;
effective sanctions against corruption; (iii) the creation of effective national and international&#13;
anti-corruption partnerships; and (iv) reforms of key public sector institutions. Management and&#13;
implementation of the strategy will be the responsibility of the Inter-ministerial Committee in&#13;
charge of execution of the Poverty Reduction Strategy.&#13;
&#13;
7.       With regard to the creation of the legal regulatory      and institutional  anticorruption&#13;
framework,     the authorities have: (i) created the Commission         against Corruption, Fraud,&#13;
Smuggling, and Money Laundering (August 2002); (ii) adopted the Code of Ethics and Good&#13;
Conduct applicable to all public officials (November 2002), for which application decrees are&#13;
currently being drawn up; and (iii) drafted an anticorruption law to be presented to Parliament3.&#13;
Sanctions will include withdrawal of licenses and operating agreements, and tines. Effective&#13;
partnerships will be fostered between the public sector, civil       society, the private sector and&#13;
international organizations specialized in the fight against corruption, such as Transparency&#13;
International and Interpol, and measures taken to improve public accessto relevant information.&#13;
Finally, reform of public institutions will include (i) civil    service reform, (ii) judicial  sector&#13;
reform, (iii)  steps to improve the quality of service delivery in health, education, rural&#13;
development and infrastructure, and (iv) improved public            finance management including&#13;
revenues, expenditures, procurement, and transparency and accountability at all levels.&#13;
&#13;
8.       Civil service reform. A comprehensive reform of the public administration is needed to&#13;
reduce corruption, improve governance and public service delivery. Its strategy focuses on&#13;
redefining the key missions of priority ministries and public service agencies and upgrading the&#13;
productivity  and skill levels of their staff. In the meantime, with the strengthening of revenue&#13;
mobilization  and the streamlining of the civil service, salary levels will gradually increase from&#13;
their present relatively low levels. This will also help to reduce corruption, but broader incentives&#13;
and control systems to improve productivity and performance will be needed. Emphasis will&#13;
initially be on: (i) eliminating ghost workers from the civil service payroll, (ii) putting in place a&#13;
departures program       especially for civil   servants at retirement     age; (iii) undertaking a&#13;
comprehensive civil service census, and (iv) putting in place a functioning and secure integrated&#13;
personnel and payroll management system. These activities are planned for 2003.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3The anticorruption law is to be discussedby Parliament in the fourth quarter of 2003.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9.      Judicial   sector reform.   Key objectives in this area are (i) to render effective the&#13;
independence of the magistrature, in line with legislation regulating careers of public sector legal&#13;
professionals; (ii) to ensure the non-interference of political    and administrative authorities in&#13;
judicial decisions; (iii) install lower level civil courts (Tribunaux de Paix) and Commercial&#13;
Tribunals in provincial administrative centers; and (iv) apply the principle of meritocracy to&#13;
recruitment and promotion.&#13;
&#13;
10.     Improving     the quality   of public  services and institutions.     Efforts are planned to&#13;
improve the quality of services needed to reduce poverty and promote private sector-led growth.&#13;
Major actions will include the preparation of an Institutional and Governance Review during&#13;
2003-04, with assistance from IDA, that will focus on the issue of basic service delivery. A&#13;
public expenditure tracking study in key sectors will assesshow well public expenditures are as&#13;
intended and verify that the funds arrive at the intended destinations (e.g., schools, health centers,&#13;
agricultural extension services, road maintenance units, etc.). This will be complemented by (a)&#13;
assessmentsby beneficiaries of the quality of services provided, and (b) assessmentsby service&#13;
providers of the difficulties encountered in the provision of services.&#13;
&#13;
                                C.     Public Finance Management&#13;
&#13;
11.     With   assistance from    the Bank and the IMF,       the Government is undertaking a&#13;
comprehensive reform of the tax system and its administration as well as public expenditure&#13;
management. On the revenue side, the primary purpose in the short run is to simplify             and&#13;
modernize the direct and indirect tax system as well as import duties. This simplification       will&#13;
result in an increase in the tax returns and in the broadening of the taxable base. The objective in&#13;
the medium term is to introduce competitive tariff reform and VAT. The World Bank Group is&#13;
also providing assistance in the area of forestry taxation. On the expenditure side, the key&#13;
objective is to restore and modernize the budget system from commitment to payment, both at&#13;
the central and local levels. In both cases,a complete overhaul and modernization of information&#13;
and computer systems is neededas well.&#13;
&#13;
12.     The World Bank is also assisting the Government in a multi-year Public Expenditure&#13;
Review. The first review, performed in 2002, has two major goals. The first was to improve the&#13;
link between budget allocation, budget execution and reporting in the 2003 Budget Law, in order&#13;
that government expenditures be linked more closely to government intentions. The second was&#13;
to perform    in-depth studies of budget execution in three priority          sectors in which    the&#13;
Government's ability to implement        and to track implementation      will be important to the&#13;
international   community     under   the   enhanced HIPC      initiative:  health,  education   and&#13;
transport/infrastructure, and to develop an action plan for budget execution and tracking capacity.&#13;
The 2003 PER activities currently under preparation will extend the review to local local service&#13;
delivery and local oversight of such delivery.&#13;
&#13;
13.     The 2002 Public Expenditure Review also focused on the Assessment and Action Plan&#13;
(AAP) and the sectors that would benefit from HIPC debt relief, and identified specific steps in&#13;
the short term      required   to  strengthen public    expenditure    management. Steps include&#13;
implementation of a new budget classification system and a rationalized expenditure chain, full&#13;
integration of externally financed projects in budget formulation and reporting, rationalization of&#13;
control and audit procedures aswell as the implementation of a new accounting system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
               D.    Private Sector Development and Public Enterprise Reform&#13;
&#13;
14.     The government's economic reform program incorporates a vast component related to&#13;
private sector development and public enterprise reform. Major efforts are under way to improve&#13;
the overall business environment for private sector development, which is also essential to the&#13;
success of the reform of the public sector given that this will require significant private sector&#13;
participation in the form of management contracts, concessions, leasing arrangements and/or&#13;
equity participation.&#13;
&#13;
15.     Private sector development. On the legal and regulatory front, a comprehensive reform&#13;
of the legal framework governing business operations and transactions is being prepared. On the&#13;
judicial  front, the establishment of commercial       tribunals  is proceeding apace, with    the&#13;
nomination of key personnel. A new labor Code was promulgated in 2002, and its application&#13;
decrees are under preparation. A review of corporate taxation has been completed in March 2003,&#13;
on the basis of which a set of reforms and an action plan will be prepared and implemented&#13;
before the end of 2003. A one stop-shop approach is being favored through the National&#13;
Investment Promotion Agency (ANAPI),        which was created in 2002 and should help simplify&#13;
enterprise creation and approval of investments under the Investment Code. It is expected that an&#13;
audit of these and other key business related procedures would be completed by November 2003.&#13;
Finally, an audit of the government's internal debt to enterprises should be completed by end-&#13;
September 2003 and will give rise to an action plan for clearance of net government arrears, i.e&#13;
taking account of tax arrears on the part of enterprises. It is expected that an internal debt&#13;
restructuring plan should be in place in November 2003.&#13;
&#13;
16.     Public Enterprise Reform. The government's economic reform program includes a vast&#13;
reform of the public enterprise sector, with the objective of ensuring that basic services are&#13;
provided on a sustainable basis and to a larger segment of the population, while reducing the&#13;
drain on public finances resulting from public enterprises mismanagement. An Inter-ministerial&#13;
Committee will manage the reform, with day-to-day management being handled by the steering&#13;
committee for the reform of public enterprises (COPIREP) that was created by a Presidential&#13;
Decree on October 31, 2002. Personnel selection for the Executive Committee of COPIREP will&#13;
be completed in June 2003. In parallel, operational and financial audits of the enterprises were&#13;
begun in mid-November 2002, with results delivered to Government in April 2003. From this&#13;
basis, building   upon existing sectoral policies, and with      the support of sectoral groups&#13;
representing the enterprise under reform, employees, trade unions and sectoral experts, COPIREP&#13;
will elaborate reform strategies for each enterprise. Efforts beginning in July 2003 will focus on&#13;
SNEL (electricity), SNCC (railroads), OCPT (telecommunications), LAC (the national airline)&#13;
and RVA (the Airports Authority).&#13;
&#13;
                                     E.      Financial Sector&#13;
&#13;
17.     A central part of the government's reform program pertains to the financial sector, with&#13;
the primary emphasis to date being put on the (a) reforming the legal and regulatory framework&#13;
for the banking sector; (b) restructuring the central bank and improving its management; and (c)&#13;
restructuring commercial banks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18.     The legal and regulatory framework.         In early 2002, the Parliament adopted a series of&#13;
laws: (a) granting independence to the Central Bank; and (b) governing the banking sector&#13;
including financial cooperatives. A presidential decree also prohibits the Central Bank from&#13;
executing payments that have not been approved by the Ministry of Finances.&#13;
&#13;
19.     Restructuring     the   Central    Bank     and   improving    its  management.     Restoring&#13;
sustainable economic growth prospects will require, inter alia, restructuring of the Central Bank&#13;
and substantially improving its management. Estimates for 2002 show that its financial operating&#13;
account is structurally in deficit, its sources of revenues are low whereas current expenditure and&#13;
the cost of producing banknotes need to be financed. The BCC financial situation in 2002 has&#13;
deteriorated more than envisaged under the program, and at end-September 2002, its net financial&#13;
loss amounted to about 0.3 percent of GDP, compared to 0.1 percent of GDP in the program. To&#13;
avoid monetary financing of the deficit, the projected net financial loss will continue to be&#13;
consolidated within the government budget.&#13;
&#13;
20.     To redressthis situation, the government is receiving substantial technical assistancefrom&#13;
the IMF. In addition, external audits for 2000 and 2001 financed by IDA have recently been&#13;
completed, which has led to the replacement of four department directors. In addition, an action&#13;
plan to addressthe major problems has been drawn up. The key issues to be addressedconcern:&#13;
(i) lapses in accounting procedures; (ii) management of international reserves; (iii) internal audit&#13;
procedures; and (iv) the control and supervision of the banking system. The external audit was&#13;
complemented by an IMF safeguardsmission that took place in October 2002 and concluded that&#13;
significant vulnerabilities exist, especially in the BCC's external audit mechanism, the financial&#13;
reposting framework and internal control mechanisms, and the resulting recommendations have&#13;
been included in a detailed action plan which the BCC has already started to execute. Looking&#13;
forward, there will be (i) annual external audits of the BCC accounts in general, and (ii) half&#13;
yearly audits of the levels of domestic assets,net foreign assets,and net credit to the government.&#13;
&#13;
21.     Commercial       bank   restructuring.    The government's      strategy also calls for:    (i)&#13;
conducting audits of all banks; (ii) liquidating banks which are not viable; (iii) restructuring those&#13;
that are undercapitalized but are deemed viable. This will involve updating audits of four banks,&#13;
namely the Commercial Bank of Congo (BCDC); the Union of Congolese Banks (UBC); and the&#13;
International Bank for Credit (BIC) and Standard Chartered Bank (Stanbic) as well as conducting&#13;
audits of four banks which have not yet been audited, namely the Bank of Commerce and&#13;
Development (BCD), Citibank, the International Bank for Congo (BIAC); and Fransabank. On&#13;
the basis of these audits, restructuring strategies will then be prepared for public sector banks, but&#13;
those that are judged insolvent and illiquid     will be closed down. Private sector banks will be&#13;
required to sign Memoranda of Understanding with the banking regulator for the preparation of&#13;
actions plans for restructuring and the restoration of financial equilibria. All banks will be&#13;
required to come into compliance with prudential norms. These audits are now expected to be&#13;
completed by end-August 2003, and the restructuring strategies/action plans prepared by end-&#13;
December 2003. In this vein, the authorities have initiated liquidation proceedings for the New&#13;
Bank of Kinshasa (NBK) and the Agricultural Credit Bank (BCA) in the last quarter of 2002 and&#13;
for the Bank of Commerce and External Trade (BCCE) in March 2003.&#13;

            Congo, Democratic Republic of - Economic
            Recovery Credit Project : Release of the Mining Sector Tranche
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Economic Recovery Credit Project
            supports broad reforms in forestry, mining, public
            enterprise, finance, governance and anti-corruption.
            Consequently, the Government successfully initiated a
            macroeconomic policy framework for growth and poverty
            reduction, that, notwithstanding higher than programmed net
            credit to government, lower accumulation of foreign
            reserves, and higher inflation than programmed, is
            consistent with the objectives of the reform program. This
            tranche release of the mining sector is now available for
            disbursement as provided in Section 3.01 and Schedule 1 of
            the Development Credit Agreement, following consultations on
            the reviewed progress achieved in implementing the program.
            In light of the satisfactory progress achieved, and the
            consistency of the macroeconomic policy framework for growth
            and poverty reduction with the objectives of the reform
            program, it is the conclusion that all specific conditions
            pertaining to the release of the mining sector tranche have
            been met.
