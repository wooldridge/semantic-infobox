                         Wapenhans, Willi A.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Interview conducted by Professor William Becker and David Milobsky, on&#13;
1993-08-19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     This interview addresses the report reviewing the Bank's&#13;
portfolio, "Effective Implementation: Key to Development Impact",&#13;
commonly referred to as the Portfolio Management Task Force Report.&#13;
Mainly, the events which led then President Preston in early '92 to&#13;
give Wapenhans the responsibility to produce such a report, the&#13;
background to the report, the creation of a special task force, the&#13;
workings of the task force; its findings, conclusions and&#13;
recommendations, the reaction both internally within the Bank&#13;
including that of Management and the Board as well as externally, and&#13;
Wapenhans' thoughts on effective implementation of the report.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Wapenhans sums up with his own personal opinion on the&#13;
Institution with the following: "There is a declining trend in project&#13;
performance, highly concentrated in IDA countries and the Bank is&#13;
contributing to it because of the presence of an approval culture. To&#13;
remain the leading and preeminent institution that it is, it needs to&#13;
reverse, and it can reverse to its earlier emphasis on performance. It&#13;
should not resort to more bureaucracy, to a further invitation to&#13;
promote compliance. It should not invite its staff, including its&#13;
managers, to protect their rear. Such an emphasis would further foster&#13;
risk aversion, not only of staff but also of managers. If not&#13;
contained, it could retard development."&#13;

            In July and August 1993, Willi A.
            Wapenhans was interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group
            Archives oral history program by Professor William Becker
            and David Milobsky. During his tenure at the Bank from 1961
            to 1992, Mr. Wapenhans worked in the following areas: in the
            agriculture projects department as deputy director
            (1968-1972); in the Europe, Middle East and North Africa
            (EMENA) region projects department as director (1972-1975);
            as vice president for the EMENA region (1975-1976,
            1984-1987, and 1990-1991), eastern Africa region
            (1975-1984), and for the office of the president
            (1991-1992); as senior vice president for the administration
            (1987) and for the office of external affairs (1987-1990);
            for the portfolio management task force as consultant
            (1992); and as executive secretary for the development
            committee task force on multilateral development banks
            (1995-1996). Mr. Wapenhans discusses the reorganization of
            the World Bank by Robert McNamara in 1972, during which time
            he was asked to reorganize the Agriculture Department into
            regional establishments. This transcript concludes with a
            comparative evaluation of the presidents Eugene Black,
            George Woods, Robert McNamara, Alden Clausen, Barber
            Conable, and a reserved evaluation of Lewis Preston.
