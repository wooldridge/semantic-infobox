                  A CONVERSATION WITH SIMON ALDEWERELD, II                      ALD~WERELD:     Yes, it was during the early years of the Black Regime.&#13;

                              Robert W. Oliver                                  based on experiments in India by the U.S. Corps of Engineers during&#13;

                                                                                World War II.     The project"s objective was to eradicate the weed by&#13;

                                                                                using a large number of heavy tractors, working as a team, to deep-&#13;
&#13;
ALDEWERELD:   What I'm going to say is the recollection of Simon                plough very large agricultural areas infested with this weed.             The roots&#13;
&#13;
Aldewereld some 25 years after the events.                                      would be exposed to the sun and die, and the land, after lying fallow&#13;
&#13;
          One way of describing the World Bank's relations with India           for some time. would then be restored to fertility.         This develop1aent&#13;
&#13;
under the Black Regime, a bit more than the Woods Regime, is to think of        loan was based on the deeply felt conviction that we must help the&#13;
&#13;
a mixture of hot and cold.    I believe that the temperature was a bit          farmers to increase their food production.        Food was the number one&#13;
&#13;
colder during the Black Regime than during the Woods Regime.       Both         problem.&#13;
&#13;
presidencies, however, regardless of the temperature, were characterized        OLIVER:    May I interrupt to observe, therefore, that agricultural&#13;
&#13;
by a common conviction shared by all the people in authority in the             projects go back to the very beginning of development lending by the&#13;
&#13;
World Bank.   This was the realization that in India we had to deal with        Bank.&#13;
&#13;
development problems of unprecedented dimension, difficulty and                 ALDEWERELD:     Absolutely, and I think that is important.       This project&#13;

&#13;
of substantial help.                                                            Organization).    The results of the project fell somewhat short of&#13;
&#13;
          This was manifested by one of the first develo~ent loans the          expectations for a number of reasons.       The whole loan, by the way, was&#13;
&#13;
Bank ever made;     the Kans Grass project.    This project was designed        about $5 mi 11 ion.&#13;
&#13;
specifically to increase the productivity of Indian agriculture.          You   OLIVER:    A smallish loan.&#13;
&#13;
may have heard about it.                                                        ALDEWERELD:     It was a beginning.   Why did the re su 1 t s fa 11 short?   Two&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    I have not.                                                          very able men conceived it:     General ''Spec" Wheeler, the former Chief of&#13;
&#13;
ALDEWERELD:    The Kans Grass project loan was made, I think, about 1950.       Engineers, and his civilian associate, Jack Connors.         It was assumed&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Very early.                                                          that the high level of maintenance obtained during the sn1all-scale&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       3                                                                               4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
experiments I just mentioned would also prevail during the                           irrigation, navigation, flood control and the like.      I recall that the&#13;
&#13;
implementation of the large-scale operations envisaged in the project.               Bank financed one or more 1 arge power stations, fue 11 ed by the va 11 ey" s&#13;
&#13;
The actual level of maintenance in the Bank financed project was, in                 vast coal reserves.&#13;
&#13;
fact,    lO'W'er.                                                                              The Bank was happy to be associated with the activities of the&#13;
&#13;
            There were. in addition, administrative and bureaucratic                 D.V.C..   Although, at that time, our techniques for the measurement of&#13;
&#13;
obstacles standing in the way of ploughing contiguous big areas of                   economic returns were still in their infancy -- unsophisticated compared&#13;
agricultural land.         But despite all these difficulties the project            with later years, it can be said that the Bank's financing of D.V.C.'s&#13;
&#13;
achieved a great deal.            It showed clearly that investment in agriculture   power projects was successful -- the more so because -.e did not&#13;
&#13;
resulted in increased agricultural production.           Above all something very    encounter difficult problems such as the indexing of po-.er rates caused&#13;
&#13;
important emerged which went far beyond the scope of this particular                 by super inflation, as was the case in Brazil, or a reluctance for&#13;
&#13;
project:      it demonstrated to both India and the Bank that lending for            political reasons to increase po..er rates, as -.as the case in Mexico.&#13;
&#13;
Indian agriculture deserved a very high priority.            Since, as I said, the   Our relations -.ith D.V.C. -.ere harmonious.   The financing of that&#13;
Kana Grass project was one of the first investments in India, the                    organization was also the Bank's first and happy exposure to&#13;
&#13;
experience from this project had a long-term effect, and I think a                   comprehensive regional economic development.&#13;
&#13;
beneficial one,        on the Bank's relations with that country.                              The Bank has since financed numerous Indian irrigation and rural&#13;
OLIVER:      I understand.                                                           development projects of both a regional and a more local nature.&#13;
&#13;
AI..DEWERELD:       Then, also,    in the beginning of the Bank's relations with     Practically all of them -.ere, on balance, successful; they rarely gave&#13;
&#13;
India, there was the financing of the activities of the Damodar Valley               rise to serious controversies or disputes.&#13;
&#13;
Corporation (D.V.C.).        This entity was established by the Indian                         Another happy experience in the Bank's relations with India was&#13;
&#13;
authorities and was patterned after the Tennessee Valley Authority                   the financing of the Indian Railways.     When the Authorities first&#13;
&#13;
(T.V.A.).    Its purpose was the coordinated economic development of the             approached the Bank for rail-.ay financing, I felt it desirable to retain&#13;
&#13;
Damodar Valley, an area west of Calcutta.           The valle{s resources are        a well known firm of railway management consultants to study the Indian&#13;
&#13;
substantial:         good land, abundant, high-quality coal and iron ore, and        Railways in depth.     The conclusions in the consultant's report were&#13;
&#13;
water.      The D.V.C. constructed or promoted the construction of the               extremely favorable.&#13;
&#13;
necessary infra-structure, such as roads, power stations, projects for                         The Indian Railways were the largest railway organization under&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
        single management in all the Bank's member countries including the                 this economic sector.     A sizable loan was made and the project was&#13;
&#13;
        United States.     (The Bank did not operate then in Mainland China.)              completed on schedule and without difficulty.&#13;
&#13;
                   The Railways, despite the age of the   track~   motive power and                  I give you these examples to i 11 ust rate what I said before a bout&#13;
&#13;
        rolling stock, were operating efficiently.                                         the Bank"s eagerness to help India and the warm feeling we had because&#13;
&#13;
                   The level of maintenance was very good.                                 of our ability to lend for such good projects.      The coolness in our&#13;
&#13;
                   The equipment requested for financing was appropriate to the            relations, which I also mentioned earlier, stemmed frCil'l the inability to&#13;
&#13;
        needs of the Railways and would yield sizable economic returns.                    reach agreement on the financing of a major part of the Indian Steel&#13;
&#13;
                   As I said in the beginning. 1 like to make international                Industry and to a much lesser extent the financing of the government&#13;
&#13;
        comparisons.     The Bank has made railroad loans in many parts of the             owned industrial development bank.&#13;
&#13;
        world:     in Spain, Japan. East Africa, Brazil, Peru and Mexico, to                         The Indian Government had discussed with the Bank its plans for&#13;
&#13;
        mention a few.     I will not try precisely to rank these investments.        It   a major investment in the Indian steel industry.     These plans called for&#13;
&#13;
        may be sufficient to say that the Bank considered its lending to the               an expansion of the existing, privately owned facilities of the Indian&#13;
&#13;
        Indian Railways as very successful.                                                Iron and Steel Company (liSCO) and the Tata Iron and Steel Company&#13;
&#13;
                   Somewhat less successful, I recall, was the financing of another        (TISCO) and, above all, the construction of new, large,_ integrated steel&#13;
&#13;
        form of surface transportation: highways.      For various reasons, one of         mi lÂ·ls to be owned and managed by the Indian Government.&#13;
&#13;
        them possibly the reluctance on the part of the Indian Authorities to                        The Bank had reservations about the proposed tempo of the&#13;
&#13;
        retain consultants, the completion of some of the trunk highways was               investments, which I think could have been resolved, but raised basic&#13;
&#13;
        severly delayed, with the result that substantial economic benefits were           objections to the planned ownership and management by the Indian&#13;

        lost.                                                                              Government of the proposed new integrated facilities.      Both Gene Black&#13;

&#13;
                   Another good experience was the financing of Indian                     ALDEWERELD:   Yes, indeed, but the Bank is also supposed to have regard&#13;
&#13;
        teleconllllunications.   I remember the appraisal report which stated              for private enterprise.    It is not under a mandate exclusively to&#13;
&#13;
        clearly the very substantial benefits to be derived from investment in             finance government-owned manufacturing industries. The opposite view&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   7                                                                              8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
about ownership and management was held by the Indian Government.        The     facilities of the Indian Iron and Steel Company and of the Tata Iron and&#13;
Bank's view that steel making should be left to private enterprise was           Stee 1 Company.&#13;
rejected by the Indian Authorities.                                                        The Bank also objected to lending for government owned&#13;
           The   Ban~s   objections were to a certain extent of a doctrinaire    industrial finance companies.     Compared with the steel situation,&#13;
nature, namely, as I said, that manufacturing industry should be the             however, the difference with the government of India was less&#13;
domain of private enterprise and does not belong in the public sector.           pronounced.   The Bank preferred to channel its lending to the privately&#13;
In addition, a very important part of the Bank's objections were of a            owned finance company rather than to the company owned by the&#13;
practical nature. All of us had a high regard for the Indian Civil               government.   For a number of years under the Black presidency and the&#13;
Service.     Most of the Indian Government officials had continuously to         beginning of the Woods Presidency, no funds were lent to the government&#13;
deal with very severe and vital problems.        They tried very hard to solve   owned development bank..   Then George Woods relented and the Bank's funds&#13;
them with great energy and       dedicatio~   They could barely keep up with     were channelled to both institutions.      That's why, as I said before,&#13;
their tasks and were constantly overworked.        To add to these duties of     George's coolness was slightly less than was the esse with Gene Black.&#13;
the Civil Servant the responsibility of operating in the highly                  OLIVER:   Maybe I am jumping too far ahead in the story, but it is my&#13;
competitive environment of manufacturing and marketing steel, a complex          impression that, in the middle years of the Woods administration, there&#13;
new and strange task for which he was not trained and in which he had no         were controversies also over such things as exchange rates and monetary&#13;
experience, would have been, in the Bank's opinion, asking for big               policy, which differences of opinion resulted in some acrimony between&#13;
trouble and would have been counter-productive.        Consequently, and much    the government of India and the    Ban~&#13;
&#13;
to its regret, the Bank could not agree to the government's proposals            ALDEWERELD:   You put a little more emphasis on this.     In our relation&#13;
for integrated steel mills.                                                      with India, the subject came up, but I think the way you put it&#13;
           This disagreement may well have been the reason why the Indian        overemphasizes it.&#13;
Government, which maintained its position, turned to bilateral sources           OLIVER:   In other words the difference of opinion was relatively minor?&#13;
for the procurement of these integrated stee 1 mills.      The governments of    ALDEWERELD:   No, it was not relatively minor.    What I mean to say is&#13;
the Federal Republic of Germany, of the Soviet Union, and of the United          that in the course of our constant dialogue with India the question of&#13;
Kingdom each supplied and financed an integrated steel mill.       The World     export industries obviously came up.      It was in this context that the&#13;
Bank financed the expansion of the existing privately owned steel making         Bank, frcm time to time, discussed with the government of India whether&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    9                                                                               10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
a change in the exchange rate would or would not promote        India~s         greatly from his views.&#13;
&#13;
exports.   But, as I remember. we always said that this subject was in                    We obtained the same kind of advice when the Bank was requested&#13;
&#13;
the final analysis a matter between India and the IMF.         Therefore,       by the Japanese authorities to finance the Japanese steel industry.&#13;
&#13;
relatively speaking, although the subject itself was important, it was          This happened, if I recall correctly, in the late fifties.        It was at&#13;
&#13;
not a big issue in the relations between India and the       Ban~               the beginning of the Bank's long, productive and harmonious association&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    So, to the extent there was a difference of opinion at all, it       with Japan.     I was then very much involved in developing a financing&#13;
&#13;
was primarily on the subject of whether industrial development should be        plan for the Japanese steel induf;try.       In order to help in this work,&#13;
&#13;
financed largely through the private sector or the public sector?               the Bank retained Hr. Lee Austin, the retired President of the Jones and&#13;
&#13;
ALDEWERELD:    Yes.    That I think, was the basic question.                    Laughlin Steel Ccmpany.      Hr. Austin's advice on the Japanese steel&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER: I understand.      Could we say just one additional word about the      industry covered the same subjects as George Woods' advice on the Indian&#13;
&#13;
steel business.       It is my impression that Mr. woods. as a consultant       stee 1 industry.&#13;
&#13;
many years before he came to be President of the Bank~ had some hand in         OLIVER:   Do you happen to remember what solution he suggested for the&#13;
&#13;

asked Woods to give his opinion about the Indian Steel proposals.               OLIVER:    I understand.&#13;

Since, as I said before, Woods was a corporate finance man, the                 ALDEWERELD:     â&#128;¢â&#128;¢â&#128;¢ but I know the general story.&#13;

&#13;
responsibility for close to twelve years.      I did not get involved at the                 Until partition, this reliance on 'OIIater from the tributaries&#13;
&#13;
very early stage.   I started to get involved at a scmewhat later phase.          posed no problems.       The Indian sub-continent was one country.        After&#13;
&#13;
         In order to understand the problems of the Indus River Basin.            partition, however, this situation changed drastically.         India suddenly&#13;
&#13;
one should draw a map of   w~at   is sometimes called the Indian Sub-             controlled the sources of the water supply.         It had overnight become the&#13;
&#13;
Continent, specifically the western part, which after partition was               upper-riparian country, and Pakistan, the user of the 'OIIater, had equally&#13;
&#13;
named Pakistan, and the western part of what is now India.      At the most       suddenly become the lower reparian country.&#13;
&#13;
western part of this large area is the Indus River.      It rises in Tibet                   This situation became potentially very dangerous when India,&#13;
&#13;
and flows in a southernly direction until it reaches the sea.         It is one   faced with the urgent problem of feeding a large and growing population,&#13;
&#13;
of the great rivers on earth, and, through the centuries, until about 10          declared its intention to divert the waters of the tributaries for its&#13;
&#13;
years ago, it had never been harnessed. It is often and properly                  own irrigation use.       The Pakistanis were thus faced 'OIIith the prospect&#13;
&#13;
referred to as the "Mighty Indus."      In its long course through Pakistan       that over time the flow of water would be reduced and eventually&#13;
&#13;
to the sea, it receives considerable flows of water from a number of              stopped.    Since the supply of water in the arid climate of Pakistan is a&#13;
&#13;
tributaries, big rivers in their own right.     One of these rivers is the        matter of life or death, the country faced the grim prospect of forty&#13;
&#13;
Mangla River.   These tributaries have their sources not in Pakistan but          million of its people starving to death.&#13;
&#13;
in India.                                                                                    The possibility of both nations being forced into a bloody and&#13;

&#13;
called Pakistan.    I recall a report describing this irrigation system as        with California â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢ â&#128;¢&#13;
&#13;
larger than that of the State of California.     About forty million              ALDEWERELD:       Yes, except that the Pakistan - India problem was much&#13;

irrigation system came from the tributaries and not from the Indus                overlooked or ignored in the rest of the world until there appeared in&#13;

           Since the article appeared, I think, close to thirty years ago,               This task force was small.   It included one of the two Vice-&#13;

article also proposed that the World Bank take the leadership in the          issues of political, economic and cultural nature, to mention only a&#13;

&#13;
Gene Black, because it pointed to issues which were in the domain of the                 In the end, the work of this small group was crowned with&#13;
&#13;
Bank:     resolution of questions of an international nature. engineering,    success.     I have often remarked about the reasons for this success.       In&#13;
&#13;
finance, and, in fact. the prevention of conflict and war.                    my view there were two main reasons.      One was that the group consisted&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I understand.   I take it there were two aspects of the Indus     of highly gifted people who worked very hard and with devotion.        The&#13;
&#13;
problem, one was deciding how to divide the waters, which was an              other was that the group was an integral part of the World      Ban~   And&#13;
&#13;
international legal problem.. â&#128;¢                                               the World Bank (and the group) were regarded by both parties in the&#13;
&#13;
ALDEWERELD:     The subject of an international treaty.                       conflict as an impartial body which had no ax to grind and had only one&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     and the other was the project problem of how to develop the       objective:     to be of equal help to both.&#13;
&#13;
river.    Between the two, there was probably the single most important                  One of the main features of the international water treaty was&#13;
&#13;
series of projects that the Bank had through,     say. 1960.                  that of "established use. 11   India undertook to continue to supply the&#13;
&#13;
ALDEWERELD:     Yes.   The first step Black took was to establish a small     water that Pakistan had been using. (I say this in my layman"s wordsi&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                15                                                                                     16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the legal language is of course quite different.)     I recall that during              As far as the size and dimensions of the transmission canals are&#13;
&#13;
the negotiations a tricky subject always was whether a certain quantity       concerned, they carry water over a long distance and have a very large&#13;
&#13;
of water could be considered as replacement for established use or            capacity.       I once asked Spec Wheeler to explain to me in layman's terms&#13;
&#13;
whether the water could be considered as water for development.      As 1     the capacity of the transmission canals.          He said,   11&#13;
                                                                                                                                            Siem, go to the&#13;
&#13;
said the treaty on the use of the water was an achievement of major           Memorial Bridge here in Washington after a heavy rain and look at the&#13;
&#13;
proportions.                                                                  Potomac River.         The quantity of water you see flowing under the bridge&#13;
&#13;
         Then the second part of the problem had to be resolved:     How to   is about the quantity of water you would observe flowing at any point in&#13;
&#13;
supply water to the affected irrigated area.     Two types of projects were   the transmission canals. 11&#13;
&#13;
to be bui 1 t.   One type was the construction of two dams. one on the                  The group also calculated the total cost of the projects.                I do&#13;
&#13;
tributary of the Indus River, the Mangla River, the other on the Indus        not remember the exact figure; it was, as I recall, of the order of one&#13;
&#13;
River at Tarbela.     Both dams are multi-purpose structures; they also       billion U.S. dollars.           Thus a very important problem arose:      where is&#13;
&#13;
included electric power generation facilities.     The second type was the    all that money going to come from?&#13;
&#13;
construction of canals to transmit the water stored behind the two dams                 It was at that point that Gene Black stepped in.         He&#13;
&#13;
to the irrigated area.                                                        successfully raised the funds for the Indus Basin Project.              1 told you&#13;
&#13;
         The Kangla Dam is a very large dam; the Tsrbela Dam is one of        before that he is one of the best bond traders I have ever known.                  Maybe&#13;
&#13;
the largest. if not the largest, dams ever built.     As you know, after      one of the reasons for his success was that he believed in the good&#13;
&#13;
World War II there was one dam that was at the center of attention of         quality of the product he sold.          In the case of the Indus Basin Project&#13;
&#13;
governments and politicians all over the world.     It is a gravity dam of    he certainly believed in its quality.          He solicited the help of many&#13;
&#13;
major proportions.    It is called the Aswan Dam on the Nile.   Every         governments:      of the United States, the United Kingdom, Canada, the&#13;
&#13;
student of economic history knows about this dam.     It is my opinion that   Federal Republic of Germany, Australia, New Zealand and India.                He&#13;
&#13;
very few people know about the Tarbela Dam and how this dam compares          received pledges from these and maybe a few more governments, to which&#13;
&#13;
with the Aswan Dam.    The Tarbela Dam is also a gravity structure and is     he added the pledge of the World Bank and         ID~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
several times bigger than the Aswan Dam.     It took many more millions of              The result of Black's great effort was that the financing of the&#13;
&#13;
tons of cubic yards of earth and rock to build the Tarbela Dam than it        cost of   t~e   projects, as indicated by the cost estimates I mentioned,&#13;
&#13;
took to build the Aswan Dam.                                                  was assured.      It   wa~   agreed that all this money would be merged into one&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   17                                                                                18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
fund, to be disbursed by the Bank to pay for the expenditure for the          ALDEWERELD:     Yes, it was the tail end of the Black period.&#13;
&#13;
Indus Basin Project as these expenditures actually were incurred.                     One of the first steps to be taken for the implementation of the&#13;
&#13;
The fiduciary responsibility of the Bank for disbursement, which I            Indus Basin Project was the commissioning of the detailed engineering&#13;
&#13;
mentioned earlier, became even greater because of the addition of all         for the various individual components in preparation for the subsequent&#13;
&#13;
the funds from goveroments to help us with the execution of the Indus         international competitive bidding.           The bids received on one or more of&#13;
&#13;
Basin Project.                                                                these components indicated that the original cost estimates, prepared by&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Were these grants from the member goveroments of the              or under the auspices of the study group, were too low and that if&#13;
&#13;
consortium. or were these loans?                                              nothing was done the construction of one or more of the individual&#13;
&#13;
ALDEWERELD:     They were a combination of loans, some if not all             projects in the scheme might not be started for lack of money or, if&#13;
&#13;
subsidized, and outright grants.                                              started, might grind to a halt.&#13;
&#13;
          It was about that time that Black asked me to take over.      He            This was obviously a most embarrassing situation, because it was&#13;
&#13;
said that the study group bad completed its work and that he wanted me        quite clear that we had to go back to the contributing goverJliD.ents for&#13;
&#13;
to add the supervision of the disbursement and "end-use" of the Indus         additiona 1 funds.    Since we f ore&amp;aw the possi bi 1 ity of que at ions whether&#13;
&#13;
Basin Project to my duties as Director of Projects, which included the        the scheme would still be economically justified in the face of the&#13;
&#13;
supervision of disbursement and end-use of all Bank and IDA financed          higher investment costs, we organized a group recruited from within the&#13;
&#13;
projects.     It was a considerable addition to my task.    I gladly          Bank to render this    11&#13;
                                                                                                          second opinion. 11   We were fortunate to be able to&#13;
&#13;
accepted.     The disbursement and end-use supervision work for the Indus     appoint as head of the group Dr. Peter Lieftinck, the man we talked&#13;
&#13;
Basin Project was carried out in the same careful manner as for all Bank      about before.    The main attention of the group focussed on the most&#13;
&#13;
and IDA financed projects.     Because of the additional workload, I had to   capital intensive project of all, the Tarbela Dam.            This second opinion&#13;
&#13;
add, on a temporary basis, to the services of the permanent Bank              was rendered, and it confirmed that, despite the higher cost estimates,&#13;
&#13;
supervisory staff the services of a number of qualified outside               the entire scheme, including Tarbela, was amply justified.            We were able&#13;
&#13;
engineers and auditors.                                                       to mobilize the additional financial resources.            All the contracts were&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     About what year was this?                                         then let, after international competitive bidding, in accordance with a&#13;

ALDEWERELD:     I think it was ..62.                                          pre-arranged time schedule, and construction started.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     It was the very tail end of the Black period.                             The contract for the Mangla Dam was won by an American firm&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  19                                                                             20&#13;

named Guy Atkinson of San Francisco.      George Woods and I went to the        OLIVER:    It surely does.   What other projects do you think of as being&#13;
&#13;
site when construction was in full swing.       It was a marvelous sight.       particularly important -- not necessarily in India, but anywhere in the&#13;
Hundreds of pieces of heavy equipment moving with precision over the            world -- where the Bank baa played a major role affecting the&#13;
vast area where the dam came into being.      The job was finished ahead of     development of the country involved, or countries in as the case of&#13;

ALDEWERELD:     George Woods knew a lot about it when he became President.      give you a few examples:     The Damodar Valley Project, which I mentioned;&#13;
George's visit to the Kangla site was, I think, the fir&amp;t visit he made         the Niger Dam Project in Nigeria; the Roaeires Dam Project in the Sudan;&#13;

ALDEWERELD:     I don't recall this.   It may be.   After all he was one of     is in order for me to say something about the four reconstruction loans&#13;
&#13;
our main bankers.                                                               which the Bank made in the late forties to France, the Netherlands,&#13;

          The Tarbela Dam was completed a few years after the completion        Denmark and Luxembourg (in chronological order).     These loans do not&#13;

&#13;
took about ten years fran start to finish.                                      in the Banl(s name) and not for developm.ent (the second objective in the&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     The World Bank would have been worthwhile if it had done            Bank's name).    They did, however, meet your requirement of the Bank&#13;
nothing else, I should have thought, than just this one series of               playing a major role.    I say this while recognizing that, at the time or&#13;
&#13;
projects.                                                                       soon thereafter, the Marshall Plan became a major factor in the&#13;

ALDEWERELD:    Yes, indeed. You asked me over the telephone, What is one        reconstruction of Western Europe.&#13;
&#13;
of your main projects?    Although I was not active in it at the very                     The purpose of the four loans was essentially to help the&#13;
&#13;
beginning, I can readily say, yes, the entire Indus Basin Project was           countries to get on their feet again.    They were not project loans in&#13;
&#13;
one of the major achievements in which I was involved.       Does this answer   the strict sense of the word.    Their purpose was the financing of the&#13;

transformed from a borrower into a lender.       We in the Bank were of         highways, the project appraisals, the evaluation of bidding documents.&#13;

         Some time after Japan's approach for lending was received, a       Department to my department, the Projects Department.     Frcm that point,&#13;
&#13;
Bank mission went to Japan.    This was the beginning of numerous Bank      on, I became more and more involved in the Bank's lending operations&#13;

missions of loan officers, country economists, project engineers,           with Japan.&#13;
&#13;
transportation and industrial economists and financial analysts to                     The projects in the transportation sector were identified and&#13;
&#13;
Japan.   It was a two-way traffic: many Japanese Government officials,      prepared by entities in the public sector:     the Japanese National&#13;
&#13;
officials of government agencies, such as the Japanese National             Railways and the Japanese National Highway Authority.     The projects in&#13;
&#13;
Railways, the Japanese National Highway Organization and officers of        the power sector, with one exception, were prepared by the major&#13;
&#13;
power and steel companies visited the Bank headquarters in Washington.      privately owned power companies.     The exception was a hydro-electric&#13;
&#13;
         These contacts initially produced little result; a Bank loan of,   "thin arch dam," the Kurobe Dam, prepared by a govermnent agency,      the&#13;
&#13;
as I recall, $10 million was made for the procurement of industrial         Electric Power Development Corporation.     All the projects in the steel&#13;

equipment.   S001e time later, however, the increasingly intensive          sector were prepared by privately owned steel companies:     the Kawasaki&#13;
&#13;
discussions between Japan and the World Bank began to show results.         Steel Company, the Kobe Steel Company, the Nippon Kok.an Steel Company,&#13;
&#13;
         The Bank had become more and more familiar with the activities     the Nippon Steel Company (a merger of the Fuji and Yawata Steel&#13;
&#13;
of the Japanese economic planners and with their projections of the         Companies) and the Sum.itomo Metals Limited.&#13;
&#13;
country's economic growth.    The result was the Bank's concurrence with               Because of the vital importance of these investments to Japan's&#13;
&#13;
the Japanese authorities that investment in three economic sectors were     economic growth, a few observations are in order about the preparation,&#13;
&#13;
of crucial importance for the achievement of Japan's economic goals.        the appraisal, the negotiation and the execution of the projects in the&#13;
&#13;
These sectors were power, steel and transportation, particularly road       three sectors.&#13;
&#13;
and rail transportation. All these activities leading up to this phase                 The~~.            Japan already at that time had practically&#13;
&#13;
in the Bani(s relations with Japan were mainly conducted by the people      exhausted its hydro-electric power potential.     As 1 mentioned there was&#13;
&#13;
in the Loan Department under the guidance of Hartin Rosen.                  only one hydro-power project, in the lending program:     the Kurobe Dam.&#13;

         Once agreement had been reached on these macroeconomic             It is located high up in a mountainous remote areL      This project was&#13;
&#13;
objectives, the second phase of the Bank's involvement started, namely      prepared by the Electric Power Development Corporation.    All the&#13;
&#13;
the identification and preparation of specific projects in these three      others were thermal power projects prepared by the privately owned&#13;

&#13;
service area is. maybe, the most industralized region of Japan.     Since    staff, the Bank retained a steel expert, Mr. Lee Austin, a retired&#13;
&#13;
Japan has no fossil fuel resources at all and all fuel has to be             President of the Jones and Laughlin Steel Company.     The projects&#13;

imported, the power companies had, after careful study, opted for            submitted for financing ranged from important additions to existing&#13;
&#13;
large, highly efficient, oil-fired power units.                              facilities to the construction of new, integrated steel mills.&#13;

        All the projects for generating, transforming, transmitting and                Contrary to most steel producing countries, Japan has no&#13;

distributing electric power were carefully appraised by the Bank's           reserves of the two most important raw materials required for steel&#13;
&#13;
engineers.   The organization of the power companies and their financial     making:     high grade iron ore and high quality coking coal.    These&#13;

        The conclusions of the Bank staff were that the projects were        can be said that the charge of these materials in a blast furnace of a&#13;

that, with a relatively minor adjustment of the rate base (with which        and Steel Company in Jamshedpur, where these raw materials are found in&#13;

connection and a new highway connection between Tokyo and Osaka, a            exactly like the one in the proposed project on which it had tested many&#13;

largest cities of Japan: centers of culture, government, industry,            decided on.&#13;

projects would include other very important centers, such as Nagoya,          agreement with the engineering features of the proposed projects.           Nor&#13;

carrying both passengers and freight.    The then existing highway            Many questions were raised, however, by our transportation economists,&#13;
&#13;
facilities between the two cities were inadequate.                            such as possible competition between the proposed new railroad and the&#13;
&#13;
        TI!.e Japanese proposal was for the construction of an entirely       express highway.   Would there be enough traffic to justify both1         There&#13;
&#13;
new railroad for the mass transport of passengers only.     Both              were questions such as whether the increased passenger traffic could be&#13;

railroad track would be newly constructed and would be built to exacting      existing railroad connection than by the construction of the proposed&#13;

standards.   The trains would be operated with high frequency and at high     railroad.   The Japanese authorities had carried out thorough studies on&#13;

speed, traveling the 350 miles distance in three hours.    The                these aspects of the projects.     They produced traffic studies and&#13;

important problema during the negotiation phase of the two                    Bank had financed; both the "Bullet Train 11 project and the multi-lane&#13;

transportation projects.   Construction proceeded smoothly and the            highway were extended well beyond the city of Osaka.     The power&#13;

projects were completed on schedule and within the cost estimates.      The   companies continued to add generation, transmission, and distribution&#13;

actual traffic on the expressway and the railroad amply demonstrated the      facilities.   An example in the steel- sector is the continued expansion&#13;

        This phase of the Bank's relations with Japan (as were                All of these operations were in the form of publicly issued, fixed-&#13;

subsequent phases) was a source of great satisfaction to all of us in         income securities.   From the very beginning, however, Gene Black felt&#13;

There may well be in any market a limit to the "absorptive capacity" for            placements with Japanese institutional investors and banks.&#13;

give you a categorical answer.       I do think that both Black and Woods           philosophical reasons are opposed to population control.     In such cases&#13;

were right to expand into areas other than what one could call the                  the Bank should not insist.     There may be other cases where a member&#13;

ALDEWERELD:      Yes.   Why should we provide people with electricity and not       ALDEWERELD:    It is not that Woods started agricultural lending, but he&#13;
&#13;
with safe potable water?       In the same spirit, I think we should also           expanded it.   It was not because Black held back on agriculture.    There&#13;

finance drainage projects.                                                          is a time for everything.    We started with infrastructure loans such as&#13;

it, but the World Bank can't do everything.       A special problem with            think there was any difference of opinion between Black and Woods about&#13;

housing is that, if you want to achieve significant results, the amounts            the need for agricultural lending, but, as it happened, when Woods&#13;

&#13;
OLIVER:    Did the Bank begin to approve some agricultural projects which          mark on the World BanL&#13;
earlier it would not have approved'?                                               OLIVER:   I've been told that one specific thing that happened was more&#13;
&#13;
ALDEWERELD:     I don't think so.                                                  cooperation between the World Bank, on the one hand, and various other&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    How about in the McNamara years, when supposedly more loans             United Nations organizations,      like the FAO, on the other.&#13;
&#13;
were made for small farmers?                                                       ALDEWERELD:     Yes,   the FAO and UNESCO.&#13;
&#13;
ALDEWERELD:     Under McNamara there was more emphasis on the small                OLIVER:   Was that in project work?&#13;

farmers.     Bob McNamara was essentially right, but,    in~   opinion, he may     ALDEWERELD:     It was the ''Cooperative Program" with FAO and UNESCO.    Dick&#13;

&#13;
know the full answer to your question..                                            that education and agriculture are so important.      He also felt that we&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Is this a good time to ask for your summation of the major              had a limited staff and we, therefore, ought to enlist the help of the&#13;
&#13;
thrusts of the Woods administration?       What ideas came forth between '63       specialized agencies.      They could mobilize the necessary human resources&#13;
&#13;
and '68, not only in projects but in other areas too?                              (we should pay them) for the identification and preparation of projects&#13;
&#13;
ALDEWERELD:     This is a difficult question..    Sometimes one can observe        in their respective fields.      The basic idea was a good one.   However,&#13;
&#13;
that under the regime of a chief executive the corporation assumes a               both organizations are, in fact, rather unwieldy bureaucracies.        I have&#13;

certain identity.       In the course of time, another chief executive takes       always felt that FAO did a relatively better job than UNESCO. My opinion&#13;
&#13;
office and the character or direction of that company may change.           One    is that the Cooperative Program with FAO was a moderate success and the&#13;
&#13;
cannot say this about the difference between the Black and Woods                   program with UNESCO was less than that.&#13;
&#13;
administrations.     The transition was a smooth one.     The only thing I can     OLIVER:   Is   it also possible that, over time, the Bank itself began to&#13;
&#13;
say is that Woods, for reasons that I have given, intensified and                  expand its staff in agriculture and education so that it could do for&#13;
&#13;
expanded the    Ban~s   operations when the tiwe was ripe.    That was             itself what initially it relied on FAO and UNESCO to some extent to do?&#13;
&#13;
important.     Woods had a very keen sense of perspective.     He taught us,       ALDEWERELD:    Maybe, to a certain extent, but may I remind you that FAO&#13;
&#13;
his associates, to look far ahead, farther than we used to do.           Another   and UNESCO were never called upon to appraise or supervise projects.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  39                                                                            40&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Their job was project identification and, in some cases, preparation.          before. he concentrated on the recruitment of staff because he felt. and&#13;
&#13;
The problem that we encountered was that their ideas of how to identify        rightly so. that without competent people the Bank could not&#13;
and prepare a project were often different from what several people in         satisfactorily carry out the task for which it was created.      I remember&#13;
the Bank, including me, thought identification and preparation should          an interview with him in the fall of 1946 in which he offered me a job&#13;
be.   As I said,   ~   personal feeling is that while the idea was a good      in the Treasurer's Department, which I gladly accepted.      I was struck by&#13;
one, the actual results were not an unqualified success.                       his knowledge of economic and financial affairs both in the United&#13;
OLIVER:    It is my impression that the Bank today is very nearly self-        States and elsewhere.&#13;
sufficient in tenna of expertise.                                                        Early in December, 1946, Hr. Heyer resigned. The resignation&#13;
ALDEWERELD:    That may well be.                                               became effective about a week before Christmas 1946.&#13;
OLIVER:    That; a part of the reason why it has expanded its staff so                   These were the facts.   The question remains:   Why did Mr. Heyer&#13;
substantially.                                                                 resign?    I will try to give you my personal interpretation of this&#13;
ALDEWERELD:    Yes.    The great expansion came after my retirement.    I      event.    It is based on my personal recollection and on discussions with&#13;
still follow the Bank fran a distance.      Maybe there is an optimum limit    my then supervisors and colleagues at, and after, the time of Mr. Meyers&#13;
on size.   The Bank will be faced with that problem..    It should beware      resignation. It could be said, as I think it was said at the time, that&#13;
not to lose the efficiency for which it is so justly famous.                   the task which Hr. Heyer had set for himself, that of assembling a&#13;
OLIVER:    I wonder if we could turn to the President's Council which was      competent staff. was in fact accomplished.    This was indeed a valid&#13;
important in the Woods days.     Also. I think you said last time you          reason.&#13;
wanted to say a bit about Eugene Heyer and his importance in the                         There may, however, have been an additional reason for Mr.&#13;
recruitment of the staff in the beginning of the Bank.                         Heyer's decision to leave.    It could also be said that Hr. Meyer&#13;
ALDEWERELD:   In June. 1946 0 President Truman appointed Eugene Heyer as       resigned because of a difference of view between him and some Executive&#13;
&#13;
the first President of the World Bank.      It was a wise decision.    When    Directors, notably the U.S. Executive Director, Hr. Fmilio Collado. on&#13;
Hr. Heyer assumed the Presidency be could look back on his great               the subject of the authority and responsibility of the President of the&#13;
&#13;
achievement in both private enterprise and public service.      He was a man   Bank, on the one hand, and of the Board of Executive Directors, on the&#13;
highly respected in both corporate boardrooms and in the highest               other.    It was a difference of view of a conceptual and not of a&#13;
&#13;
echelons of government for his judsment and wise counsel.      As I said       personal nature.    It was an issue that arose when the Bank was only a&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  41                                                                             42&#13;

&#13;
few months old.    Therefore, it could not be resolved by reference to           the United States.    At that time he could already look back on a&#13;
&#13;
events that had happened in the Bank's past.        It was an issue on which     distinguished and successful career in Government service.     It may well&#13;
&#13;
reasonable men could diffeu         It was an issue that. because it happened    be that Hr. Collado, and for that matter other members of the Board&#13;
&#13;
during the Bank's infancy    can~   in retrospect, be considered as a case of    representing other nations, did not have the clear cut organizational&#13;
&#13;
''teething trouble" or "growing pain, 11 a phase that every child bas to go      concept of Hr. Meyer, but a different one which would have put more&#13;

&#13;
           The Bank is shareholder owned, just like major corporations such      difference in concept, to my mind, was at the root of the problem:&#13;
&#13;
as AT&amp;T and IBM in the United States and imperial Chemical Industries in         whether or not the Bank should be run as if it were a private sector&#13;
&#13;
the United Kingdom.    The only difference is that, in the case of the           corporation or as an institution of a different nature, in which the&#13;
&#13;
World Bank, the shareholders are exclusively sovereign governments.        The   lines of authority and responsibility were less clearly drawn.&#13;
&#13;
Bank, like corporations in the private sector, has a Chief Executive.                    Mr. Heyer's departure as President of the Bank in mid December,&#13;
&#13;
The Bank, like corporations in the private sector. bas a Board of                1946, marked the beginning of a period in the Bank's history often&#13;
&#13;
Directors.                                                                       referred to as ''the Interregnum.''   It was a period of confusion and&#13;
&#13;
           In the private sector the relationship between the Board of           frustration for the relatively small staff.     This state of affairs got&#13;
&#13;
Directors and Chief Executive, although it differs fran country to               even worse when in January, 1947, the only Vice President of the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
country and even fran corporation to corporation, had fallen into a              Mr. Harold Smith, passed away.&#13;
&#13;
generally accepted pattern that has evolved gradually over the years.                    It was due to the efforts of the very few department heads,&#13;
&#13;
Painting this pattern with a broad brush, the Chief Executive has the            notably of Chester McLain, the Bank's first General Counsel, that the&#13;
&#13;
sole authority and responsibility for the conduct of affairs of the              staff continued its work of preparation of the lending and borrowing&#13;
&#13;
company.     The Board of Directors on the other hand, representing the          activities, which it hoped would materialize at an early date.&#13;
&#13;
shareholders, has a different authority and responsibility, namely to                    The Interregnum ended on March 17, 1947, when Hr. John J.&#13;

the Chief Executive.                                                             second President.    He brought with him a former Vice President of the&#13;

           Mr. Collado joined the Bank's Board as the Director representing      General Foods Corporation to serve as the Bank's second Vice President.&#13;

              We were overjoyed.   Finally, after three long months, the Bank         and more convinced that we were trying to do a thorough and professional&#13;

    had a new top management.      The preparation work carried on during the         job of helping our member countries, and the management and staff was&#13;

&#13;
    million to the Republic of France.      Shortly thereafter the Bank launched                 The Bank over the years evolved into the most important&#13;

&#13;
              I dotlt know whether or not Mr. McCloy bad received assurances          prevailed in the Board discussions helped the Bank considerably in&#13;
&#13;
    on the subject of relationship between the Board and the Management.         In   reaching this objective.&#13;
    actual fact, I think, the jurisdictional issue was never raised again.                       Another factor which was important in the harmonious&#13;
&#13;
    From March, 1947, until July, 1947, when I retired, I may well have               relationship between board and management was that the Bank was&#13;
&#13;
    attended about one thousand board meetings.     I do not recall this issue        different from most of the other specialized agencies of the United&#13;
    ever having come up at any of those meetings.      What the Board did, and        Nations.     These agencies, financially, do not stand on their own feet.&#13;

    myriad of items submitted to it by the President of the Bank for its              affluent members to stay alive.      In some if not many cases, these&#13;
&#13;
    consideration and approval.     These items covered a wide range of               requests for financial assistance have proven to be unpopular with&#13;

     well as the number of projects.   All these things were happening at the               After Woods' retirement McNamara continued the system of regular&#13;

     same time, but they all were related to IDA.                                 meetings with senior people.    Compared with the WoodS Council, the&#13;

     ALDEWERELD:   Yes, we processed more projects and many of them were more     number of people attending increased and, I think, the efficiency of the&#13;

     complicated projects, and we bad to undertake more financing.                meetings went down.&#13;
&#13;
     OLIVER:   Well, now would you say a bit about the President's Council and    OLIVER:   You and Hr. Knapp, I think, were the only two who had the&#13;

     the way in which ideas germinated?                                           official title of vice president, is that correct?&#13;
&#13;
     ALDEWERELD:   Even under Black's regime we had, from time to time, a         ALDEWERELD:   Yes.   Later on the number of Vice Presidents increased&#13;

     ALDEWERELD:   Woods continued that practice.    I remember a Lost Weekend    as essentially vice presidents?&#13;

         lending.   There were financial policy questions such as borrowing on            with that little tape recorder. and I have been talking as if this tape&#13;

         intermediate term as a supplement to the established patterns of long            recorder didn't exist.     I gave you answers the way they came to me at&#13;

&#13;
         more could we lend to a given country without stretching the limits of           careful preparation in anticipation of your questions.      Once you start&#13;
&#13;
         creditworthiness too fau        Should we change certain aspects of the          working on the verbatim. bear in mind it is very rough material. and&#13;
&#13;
         Bank'"s financial liquidity policy?       How does the administrative budget     that I reserve the right to strike this or that out because I could not&#13;
&#13;
         look for the next fiscal year? Etcetera, etcetera.                               and did not want to put a constraint on myself.     I think you were&#13;
&#13;
         OLIVER:    1 take it there were frequent meetings of the Senior Staff at         entitled to the answers as they came naturally.&#13;
&#13;
         the same time -- 1 don't mean at the same hour,       but during the same era.   OLIVER:   Well, I would say that this has been an outstanding interview&#13;
&#13;
         Were the discussions of the Senior Staff similar to the ones that took           and conversation.     I appreciate ever so much your time and your&#13;

         exchange of ideas.       They were. as were those of the President's Council.    OLIVER:   That's the understanding.    So let me again thank you today very&#13;

         our conversation.       Are they any questions that you wish I would ask that&#13;
&#13;
         I have not asked?&#13;
&#13;
         ALDEWERELD:    No.    I don't think so.   I am sure that after you leave I&#13;

         will know a dozen questions that you have not asked and that you should&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In November 1985, Siem Aldewereld was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Dr. Robert W. Oliver. During his tenure
            at the Bank from 1946 to 1974, Mr. Aldewereld worked in the
            following areas: as assistant to the treasurer of the World
            Bank; in the department of technical operations as assistant
            director (1952-1955) and as director (1955-1972); as vice
            president of the World Bank and the International
            Development Association (IDA) (1965-1968); in the projects
            department as director (1968-1969); and as vice president of
            finance (1969-1974). His transcript concerns his work as
            director when he organized the department of technical
            operations into several functional divisions and introduced
            project evaluations in a comprehensive manner. He also
            discusses the relative roles of the International Monetary
            Fund (IMF) and the World Bank in the context of the United
            Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD)
            proposal to ease the creditworthiness of borrowing countries.
