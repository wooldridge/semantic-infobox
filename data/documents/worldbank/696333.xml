PUBLIC MANAGEMENT CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
SECTION A: DETAILED PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
1.    The following section provides background and technical information on the proposed&#13;
project and consists of four chapters: Chapter I presents the country background, Chapter 11&#13;
describes public sector issues, Chapter III presents the project rationale and a detailed description&#13;
of the development assistance objectives it will serve, and Chapter IV describes project benefits&#13;
and risks.&#13;
I. Country and Operation Background&#13;
2.    At US$430 in the early 1960s, Madagascar's per capita income was in line with that of&#13;
Indonesia (US$480), and was close to that of Thailand (US$620). Thirty years later, at US$230,&#13;
Madagascar's per capita income has declined to about half its level at the time of independence,&#13;
is less than one-third Indonesia's (US$740), and is about one-tenth Thailand's (US$2,100).&#13;
Indonesia and Thailand are just two among many other developing countries that have been able&#13;
to grow at much faster rates than Madagascar which, in essence, has lost three decades of&#13;
economic development. It is thus not surprising that Madagascar's economy has provided its&#13;
population (now 13 million people, of which 80 percent live and work in rural areas) few&#13;
opportunities to improve their living standards.  Whereas the incidence of poverty has&#13;
significantly declined in Indonesia, Thailand and other developing countries, it has increased in&#13;
Madagascar. The proportion of the population living in poverty (that is, consuming less than&#13;
what is necessary to meet basic nutritional requirements) has increased from 43 percent in the&#13;
1960s to close to 75 percent in the early 1990s. The evolution described by these statistics is&#13;
matched by the population's palpable sense that its standards of living have declined over time.&#13;
The population's sense of impoverishment is accentuated by a decline in its health and&#13;
educational standards and, perhaps more importantly, by little evidence that the country's current&#13;
development policies will significantly improve its economic prospects.&#13;
3.    Two factors have contributed to this situation: ill-advised economic policies pursued in&#13;
the last 25 years and population growth of almost 3 percent per year. For 10 years following its&#13;
independence in 1960, Madagascar enjoyed modest average growth of about 3 percent per year.&#13;
However, even that faltered in the mid-1970s, as the country underwent a socialist revolution&#13;
that brought authoritarian  rule and  interventionist economic  policies.   Widespread&#13;
nationalization and extensive controls led to a long period of economic decline, and large public&#13;
investments in the late 1970s created "white elephants", severe macro-economic imbalances, and&#13;
a heavy debt burden. In the mid-1980s, the government initiated reforms, supported by Bank-&#13;
financed sectoral adjustment operations; although growth resumed, the decline in living&#13;
standards was not reversed.&#13;
4.    In mid-1991, demonstrations and strikes in support of political liberalization swept the&#13;
country and signaled the start of a lengthy transition to pluralistic democracy. The adoption of a&#13;
new constitution in August 1992 led to the election of President Albert Zafy and a new national&#13;
assembly, as well as the accession of a new govemment under Prime Minister Francisque&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
Ravony in 1993. All these changes occurred peacefully after free and fair elections. During the&#13;
transition period, however, the reforms and adjustment program derailed.&#13;
5.    In 1994, the economic situation continued to deteriorate and the GDP stagnated. After&#13;
floating the exchange rate in May and designing the complete policy agenda for a Policy&#13;
Framework Paper (PFP), the government allowed inflation to mount through lax monetary&#13;
management and an ill-conceived, large-scale program of petroleum and commodity subsidies&#13;
that increased the budget deficit. In January 1995, the government replaced the management of&#13;
the Central Bank, declared its intention to implement adjustment policies and agreed with the&#13;
IMF on a stabilization plan to bring down the inflation rate. Tensions between the President and&#13;
the Prime Minister (PM) led to a national referendum in September 1995, which shifted authority&#13;
to choose the PM from the National Assembly to the President. As a result, the former PM&#13;
stepped down and was replaced by Emmanuel Rakotovahiny, who formed a new government in&#13;
November 1995. Economic performance in 1995 was still mediocre, with a further decrease in&#13;
real per capita GDP. Political infighting continued in late 1995/early 1996, with increased&#13;
debate centered on the issue of economic reform. In May 1996, the PM received a "no&#13;
confidence" vote from the National Assembly, and the President appointed Norbert&#13;
Ratsirahonana, previously head of the High Constitutional Court, as PM. The new PM has&#13;
indicated that he wants to move quickly on an IMF/Bank-supported adjustment program, as well&#13;
as on capacity building initiatives.&#13;
6.    Economic measures implemented thus far include floating of the exchange rate, sharp&#13;
price increases for energy and the elimination of commodity subsidies.  Recently, the&#13;
government began action to divest the state from the banking sector, prepare a full scale&#13;
divestiture of public enterprises, strengthen the incentives for private sector development, and&#13;
create a safety net to combat poverty. Public expenditures have remained relatively low at about&#13;
20 percent of GDP while the composition of the public investment program has improved (see&#13;
below). These moves, if sustained, will help restore the government's credibility, while&#13;
preparing the ground for further assistance by the Bank and IMF and possible debt relief from&#13;
the Paris Club.&#13;
7.    In the absence of a structural adjustment program, the policy dialogue with the new&#13;
government has remained intense and fruitful. In spite of policy lapses, key decisions, such as&#13;
the reform of the exchange rate system and the liberalization of the petroleum sector, have been&#13;
achieved. These significant measures are still not enough to fully qualify for adjustment lending&#13;
and for the confidence of the investor community. Key areas in which a consensus for reform is&#13;
growing but are still the subject of a dialogue with the donor community include government&#13;
disengagement from the banking system, privatization, and private sector development. The&#13;
proposed project is a necessary underpinning of the efforts to help the Government get over that&#13;
threshold by helping implement improvements in areas in which there is already strong&#13;
government commitment and supporting consensus building in the remaining areas.&#13;
8.    To take further reforms that are envisaged, there is a need for economic intelligence&#13;
work. There is also a need to strengthen overall the public administration, which is unable to&#13;
perform  adequately basic public services.   These needs were identified through the&#13;
implementation of the Economic Management and Social Action Project (EMSAP), dialogue&#13;
with the IMF and other donors, OED reports, and the Private Sector Assessment (PSA). The&#13;
proposed project aims at enabling Malagasy institutions to implement needed reforms and&#13;
improved management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
II. The Project&#13;
Project Rationale&#13;
9.     Since the political transition to democratic rule started in 1991, the political leaders have&#13;
had difficulties in formulating a clear vision of an economic strategy for growth which would&#13;
allow the population to emerge from  its present situation of extreme poverty.  Political&#13;
infighting, lack of leadership and conflicting short-term goals have been the reason for this&#13;
immobilism. After four years, the government seems to have reached an agreement on a reform&#13;
program and is pursuing discussions with the Bretton Woods Institutions on a structural&#13;
adjustment program. As a recent OED audit (February 1995) of structural adjustment programs&#13;
in Madagascar points out, these programs can only be successful if they take into account&#13;
capacity constraints in delivering technically complex reforms as well as the need for consensus&#13;
building. This issue was also stressed in a 1995 Borrower Feedback Survey. This creates a need&#13;
for well-targeted technical operations to prepare the ground for a wide-ranging economic reform&#13;
program.&#13;
10.   IDA's comparative advantage. The project focuses on capacity building  in areas&#13;
where IDA support has already been successfully provided under the EMSAP, which need to be&#13;
consolidated to ensure long term sustainability of ongoing reforms. New areas of intervention&#13;
are proposed in response to Madagascar's urgent need to improve governance. IDA is well&#13;
positioned to provide this support due to extensive lessons that have been drawn from past&#13;
experience with technical assistance operations and recent innovative initiatives, for example on&#13;
a participatory approach to civil service reform. Close cooperation with donors that have&#13;
significant experience in handling specific project components (such as EUROSTAT in&#13;
strengthening of INSTAT, USAID in legal and judiciary reform and the communication strategy,&#13;
and the French cooperation in strengthening the Ministries of Finance, Budget and Planning, and&#13;
support to decentralization and legal and judiciary reform) has helped to improve project design.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
11.   Project purpose. The proposed project would provide assistance to the government to&#13;
build capacity to implement economic reforms and improve public administration.&#13;
* Economic management. By reinforcing the agencies responsible for&#13;
macroeconomic management, the project would improve the government's capacity&#13;
to design and implement an economic reform program and contribute to a sharper&#13;
focus on poverty alleviation in allocating public resources. As insufficient&#13;
information on adjustment and economic reform  has been highlighted as an&#13;
important reason for a lack of public support for adjustment, the project would help&#13;
prepare a public information campaign.&#13;
*  Public administration. The project  would facilitate a fiscally responsible&#13;
implementation of the decentralization process, thus avoiding the waste of public&#13;
resources; it would foster participation in local planning and management of the&#13;
development process while also encouraging accountability; it would catalyze&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
consensus building on civil service reform within the administration, leading to&#13;
greater commitment to reform. Finally, the project aims at making effective the&#13;
"rule of law" and improving security of business transactions through the&#13;
independence and increased effectiveness of the judiciary. Overall, the project would&#13;
help the administration, civil service, and judicial system embrace a new vision of&#13;
the role of government -- another critical precondition for a successful transition to&#13;
a private sector driven economy. This is by essence a long-term endeavor. The&#13;
project's goal is to start the process by focusing on a few achievable, but significant,&#13;
areas where feasibility is demonstrated.  A detailed description of the project&#13;
components and sub-components is provided below.&#13;
A. Strengthening Economic Management&#13;
1. Monitoring and Implementing Economic Reforms&#13;
12.   In March 1995, the government, with an eye toward preparing a new  structural&#13;
adjustmnent program, decided to reinforce its capacity to design and analyze economic policy. A&#13;
technical support unit, the Technical Secretariat for Adjustment (STA), was created. Initial&#13;
STA activities have been supported with technical assistance under the ongoing EMSAP. The&#13;
STA consists of three members: a Secretary General and two technical experts, one in charge of&#13;
macro-economic policies and the other of sectoral policies. The STA has direct access to the&#13;
Prime Minister and plays a crucial role in informing and advising on the timely implementation&#13;
of reform measures and assures a steady flow of information between financial and technical&#13;
ministries, the private sector, and donor agencies. Several technicai committees facilitate its&#13;
work. The first, Comite des Reformes Macro-Economiques et Financieres (COREMEF),&#13;
establishes the macro-economic framework, while the second, Comite des Reformes Sectorielles&#13;
(CORES), deals with sectoral policies. A third committee, Comite pour la Dimension Regionale&#13;
de l'Adjustement (CODRA), was created to insure consistency between the adjustment program&#13;
and policies pursued under the regional integration initiatives, CBI, IOC and COMESA. The&#13;
main purpose of its work will be to propose policy measures and follow up on their&#13;
implementation.&#13;
Objectives of the STA&#13;
13.   The STA's responsibilities consist of (i) monitoring the ongoing economic and sectoral&#13;
reform program, particularly the interpretation and analysis of macro-economic and social&#13;
indicators; (ii) intensifying related economic dialogue and communication, and assisting the&#13;
government in preparing discussions of a Policy Framework Paper (PFP) and SAC (ongoing);&#13;
(iii) informing government agencies involved in the adjustment process, (iv) mounting a public&#13;
information campaign on the adjustment program to mobilize broad based public support; and&#13;
(v) organizing and supporting the dialogue between private sector organizations and the&#13;
Government.&#13;
14.   In monitoring the ongoing economic and sectoral reform programs, the STA regularly:&#13;
(i) checks the status of reforms as defined in the government's policy matrix on--macro-&#13;
I/ IDA funds under PPF, No. 919-MAG, have financed advisory services and equipment of the STA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
economic, structural, and sectoral measures; (ii) follows macro-economic indicators agreed on&#13;
with the IMF and the World Bank and social indicators to be defined in cooperation with the&#13;
national statistical institute, INSTAT and UJNDP; (iii) supervises the dissemination and analysis&#13;
of statistical tables, such as the "Operations Globales du Trisor (OGT)", monetary accounts,&#13;
balance of payments, and real-sector accounts. Furthermore, the STA helps prepare structural&#13;
and sectoral reform programs and takes a leading role in coordinating and preparing the Policy&#13;
Framework Paper 1996-98. It follows up on structural and sectoral policies and assists the&#13;
authorities in the preparation of the policy dialogue that accompanies IMF/Bank-supported&#13;
adjustment programs. Based on those activities, the STA produces such reports as a monthly&#13;
assessment of the reform program (for the Government) and a quarterly bulletin (for the donor&#13;
community). It also comments on and proposes corrections to all new draft legislation related to&#13;
the adjustment program.&#13;
15.   The second important STA function is to launch a wide-ranging public information&#13;
campaigns to explain the adjustment process to the public. With technical assistance from two&#13;
local communication specialists, and in close cooperation with the ministries concerned, it will&#13;
organize seminars and workshops to familiarize members of the central and sectoral&#13;
administrations, the private sector, and the public with the objectives of the adjustment process.&#13;
USAID funded a participatory workshop in November 1994 and will support on-the-job training&#13;
of the communication specialist. The workshop resulted in-the formulation of a communication&#13;
strategy which has started being implemented. National media (radio, television, newspapers)&#13;
will help disseminate the information.&#13;
Issues to be Addressed&#13;
16.   Working conditions. To fulfill its mission, the STA needs continuous, unimpeded&#13;
access to economic and sectoral data plus the active support of the three associated committees,&#13;
COREMEF, CORES and CODRA. COREMEF meets regularly to prepare monthly economic-&#13;
indicator tables and a quarterly report on the implementation and impact of economic and&#13;
financial reform measures. CORES works mainly on defining and executing sectoral strategies;&#13;
it also supervises the activities of a committee (Comite de Suivi des Projets, CSP) designated to&#13;
monitor the implementation of projects in the three-year rolling public investment program&#13;
(PIP). This committee was first established in the context of the 1994 Country PortfQlio&#13;
Performance Review of IDA-financed projects, and the government in£tends to expand its scope&#13;
to cover other projects in the PIP. In relation with adjustment process, CODRA harmonizes&#13;
Madagascar' commitments in the context of regional cooperation; it coordinates the setting up of&#13;
adopted measures by concerned departments. The three committees can be summoned on short&#13;
notice by the STA to discuss urgent economic and sectoral policy issues. Regular meetings and&#13;
information exchange are essential and should be monitored as one performance indicator of this&#13;
component. The government has already devised a plan for a communications strategy in the&#13;
context of a national communications seminar and has started to issue small publications on the&#13;
adjustment program, targeted to the general population.&#13;
Performance Indicators&#13;
17.   A number of performance indicators have been identified to allow the monitoring of&#13;
proposed actions (strengthening of STA, training, information campaign) with respect to the&#13;
objectives they are expected to achieve (improved quality of technical dossiers; dissemination of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
information on economic development and policies within the government; internalization of&#13;
adjustment program).&#13;

2. Support to the National Institute of Statistics (INSTAT)&#13;
Background and Overview&#13;
19.    INSTAT compiles statistical data in Madagascar. INSTAT's main tasks are to produce&#13;
national accounts, publish the consumer price index, compile statistical data on foreign trade and&#13;
industrial production, and process civil service payroll data. The poor overall quality and&#13;
reliability of data stem from several factors: uncertain collection at the source in terms of&#13;
methodology, coordination, and consistency; and an outdated data base, national accounts&#13;
system, and consumer price index (the base year for the index is 1972). There is a perceived&#13;
need to strengthen the statistical system, and in particular, its capacity to produce national&#13;
accounts, households surveys and business cycle surveys on a regular and timely basis.&#13;
Objectives and Strategy&#13;
20.    On the national accounts, the objective is to strengthen INSTAT's institutional capacity&#13;
in order to produce an updated set of national accounts, which will provide a basis for the&#13;
assessment of economic performance, for forecasts of medium-term economic development and&#13;
for information requested by the private sector.&#13;
21.    The proposed project will help INSTAT to prepare: the base national accounts for 1993,&#13;
including a complete user's manual; methodology to prepare light annual accounts and compile&#13;
the data base; yearly light accounts; and the projection of national accounts over three outer&#13;
years. All activities will be accompanied by intensive training of the INSTAT staff members,&#13;
including those involved in data collection at the regional level and the necessary acquisition of&#13;
equipment.&#13;
22.    The results of Madagascar's household welfare monitoring and analysis system,&#13;
published in February 1996, will provide the basis for a number of analytical workshops, some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
of them doing further work for the preparation of a social accounting matrix (SAM) once the&#13;
relevant national account data is available. Workshop topics would cover agricultural sector&#13;
activities, the informal sector, employment and income generation, and social sectors.-- They&#13;
would follow up on the scheduled EDI-financed workshops on dissemination of the poverty&#13;
assessment. To monitor living conditions over time and further develop the poverty profile, the&#13;
proposed project will support the preparation of more selective permanent or priority surveys.&#13;
That requires the definition of focus (household sample, theme) and methodology of priority&#13;
surveys, as well as the preparation of a user's manual. Priority surveys will be undertaken every&#13;
second year, starting in 1996. Price data and indices will be published on a permanent basis.&#13;
23.    The objective of the project with respect to business cycle surveys is to assemble and&#13;
train a permanent INSTAT team able to produce such surveys two or tree times a year. Its first&#13;
task will be to prepare a user's manual to carry out the surveys. Questions about the surveys'&#13;
methodology and coverage will have to be addressed within a small workshop for potential users&#13;
and survey staff. One workshop to determine the methodology will be organized in October&#13;
1996.&#13;
Performance Indicators&#13;
24.    The government has confirmned its commitment to disseminate the data collected by the&#13;
household survey and make it available for wide public use. INSTAT would have to prepare a&#13;
data sheet on social developments, based on the findings of the household welfare monitoring&#13;
and analysis system, and make it available to the STA, first in December 1996 and then on a&#13;
yearly basis. Timely delivery of outcomes will be measured against the following schedule:&#13;

Project Support and Costing&#13;
25.    The proposed project will finance the technical assistance, equipment, and training&#13;
needed to design, conduct, and disseminate light national accounts, priority household surveys,&#13;
and a business cycle survey. Technical assistance will be required over short periods to establish&#13;
the procedures within INSTAT and to provide on-the-job-training and quality control. External&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
training will be financed as needed. The detailed budget proposal specifies the costs of this&#13;

3. Support to the Departments of Finance, Budget, Planning and Economy&#13;
Institutional Setting&#13;
26.    The Departments of Finance and Budget are the central agencies charged with&#13;
developing a financial, fiscal, and budget strategy for Madagascar. It manages state assets, the&#13;
treasury, the budget, the payroll and, it also coordinates relations with some donor organizations&#13;
(European Union, African Development Bank, FAC, Caisse Francaise de Developpement, etc...).&#13;
27.    The Treasury (Direction Generale du Tresor) plays a key role in the management of&#13;
public finance. It is responsible for fiscal receipts, payment of expenses, management of the&#13;
State treasury, management of the public debt and securities (Portefeuille de I'Etat), and within&#13;
the context of the implementation of the financial law, its accountants manage the State's&#13;
accounts, ensure financial and accounting management of local governments and certain public&#13;
autonomous agencies. Given the Treasury's evolving role and areas of interventions, as well as&#13;
the increasing volume of operations, its goal of increased efficiency and effectiveness, an&#13;
organizational audit of the Treasury will provide the basis for its reorganization. Many of the&#13;
Treasury's procedures are outdated and are replete with manual tasks. Its personnel is in dire&#13;
need of training (in-service), and the office of the Director General of Treasury needs to recruit&#13;
competent technical staff, capable of executing the mandate of the institution today and in the&#13;
future.&#13;
28.    The  Budget office  (Direction  du  Budget)  is responsible  for the  formulation,&#13;
implementation and monitoring of the budget. The main activities are the coordination for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
budget forecasting analysis, the centralization of budget execution operations, the preparation of&#13;
the budget regulatory law (loi de reglement), the financial oversight of state autonomous&#13;
agencies, and the consolidation of Public Expenditure Programs (PEP), in close association with&#13;
the Public Investment Office (Planning Department).&#13;
29.    Payroll management (Direction de la Gestion Financiere du Personnel de l'Etat) for the&#13;
entire civil service is under MFB's Directorate for personnel financial management About&#13;
90,000 agents are paid under the present system. The computerized preparation of the monthly&#13;
payroll has been farmed out for years to the National Institute of Statistics (INSTAT). The&#13;
computer equipment is outdated and more importantly, the procedures are cumbersome and&#13;
inefficient. Four agencies intervene in the process: The Ministry of Civil Service (in charge of&#13;
career management), the Directorate for personnel financial management, the INSTAT, and the&#13;
Treasury (for payment); this results in long processing times and low reliability of payroll data.&#13;
30.    The Planning and Economy Departments are known as the Direction Generale du Plan&#13;
(DGP) and the Services de l'Economie. The Planning Department structure (DGP) in&#13;
Madagascar consists of a central agency and sectoral and regional planning bodies, and is&#13;
primarily responsible for economic planning and so for the coordination of design and&#13;
implementation of economic, sectoral and regional policies. All government institutions, public&#13;
enterprises and other public agencies operate under its authority in respect to public investment.&#13;
The DGP is mandated to ensure (i) the annual preparation and the quarterly monitoring of the&#13;
physical and financial execution of the public investment program (PIP), (ii) the consolidation of&#13;
public expenditure programs (PEP) at a ministry level, (iii) the preparation of a regional&#13;
development program, and (iv) the cooperation with donor agencies. The Economy Department&#13;
structure is mandated to ensure the coordination of macroeconomic policies in close relation&#13;
with STA (P.M.'s Office) and the newly created Secretariat Permanent a la Prevision Macro-&#13;
Economique (Finance Department).&#13;
a) Objectives and Strategy for the Finance &amp; Budget Component&#13;
3 1.   Assistance to specific units: The project aims at helping the authorities determine trade-&#13;
offs between allocations for different types of expenditure and receive the needed information&#13;
for fiscal policy . It will do this by assisting various units in providing the required information&#13;
on the budget in a more transparent and timely manner:&#13;
* Permanent Secretariat for Macroeconomic Forecasting: the main objective of the&#13;
newly created "Secretariat Permanent i la Prevision Macro-economique", is to establish&#13;
on a regular basis the macroeconomic framework and to analyze the policy options.&#13;
*  Treasury: the objective is to reorganize the Direction Generale du Tresor (DGT) to&#13;
enable it, within the same payroll, to improve revenue collection and debt management,&#13;
reduce disbursement lags under investment projects and improve budget programming&#13;
and execution. With this in mind, the project will finance an organizational audit of the&#13;
Treasury to provide guidance for the reorganization. The audit will review: (i) the&#13;
Treasury's missions; (ii) the organization of central and regional services, their capacity&#13;
to implement tasks assigned to them, human resources and equipment; (iii) the&#13;
procedures for revenue collection; (iv) the accounting procedures, the information flow&#13;
and the consolidation of accounts; (v) the causes for the delays in producing the yearly&#13;
statements of budget execution; (vi) the Treasury special accounts covering earmiarked&#13;
operations, with a view to budgetize them; (vii) the impact of the budget reform and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
new government accounting plan; (viii) the impact of the decentralization on the&#13;
Treasury missions and methods. The project will also finance an evaluation of the debt&#13;
management system and how it can be transferred to the Treasury.&#13;
*  Budget Ofrice: consultant services will be provided to improve the capacity to monitor&#13;
the implementation of the budget (in parallel with the improvement at the level of the&#13;
Treasury). An organizational audit is also necessary considering the ongoing reform and&#13;
also the retraining and the staff reallocation at central and regional level. The project will&#13;
also finance training and computerization.&#13;
*  Autonomous Agencies (Etablissements Publics and Budgets Annexes): an audit of these&#13;
agencies will be supported by the project to review their legal and financial status and&#13;
propose reforms to improve their treatment in the budget. A financial audit of the&#13;
Treasury commercial accounts (Comptes Particuliers du Tresor) will also be realized.&#13;
*  Payroll Management: the proposed project will support the rehabilitation and&#13;
modernization of the payroll. New computer procedures will be put in place under the&#13;
direct responsibility of the directorate for personnel financial management.  A&#13;
preliminary study is being financed under the PPF. According to the results of the&#13;
preliminary study, new procedures will be put into place and the personnel involved will&#13;
be retrained. In a third phase, the project will finance the development of the new&#13;
computerized system, including the equipment. This will enable (i) linking the personnel&#13;
management and payroll; (ii) keeping up to date the list on which payments are based;&#13;
(iii) simplify the management of personnel to introduce flexibility in the deployment of&#13;
staff (see also component on civil service reform).&#13;
b) Objectives and Strategy for the Planning and Economy Component&#13;
32.    The government has designed a work program for 1996-97 that includes (i) a training&#13;
program of seminars and workshops to be held in Madagascar, as well as training abroad and (ii)&#13;
specific technical assistance requirements as detailed below. The government also plans an&#13;
overall assessment of the planning and economy structures and functions. This assessment is&#13;
required given the intensive workload of the Planning and Economy Departments and the&#13;
potential for duplicating the activities of Finance and Budget Departments.&#13;
33.    Assistance to specific units: the objective of assisting specific units is to enhance the&#13;
return of the public investment portfolio. The Direction Gneirale du Plan (DGP) and the Comite&#13;
de Suivi des Projets (CSP) need to develop stronger analytical capacity to assess whether the&#13;
proposed projects fit into sectoral, regional, and national economic policies and strategies, and&#13;
have an impact on the fiscal balance and benefit the economy as a whole. The project will&#13;
finance:&#13;
* an Organizational Audit of the Planning and Economy Departments: The Departments&#13;
of Plan and Economy are faced with a complex task resulting from the fusion of the old&#13;
departments of Plan, Economy as well as the Directorate for Population.  The&#13;
organization of the Department of Plan and Economy is characterized by this fusion&#13;
which is not adequate for its current ambitious mandate. The organizational audit will&#13;
be carried out to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
(i)    ensure that there are no redundancies in its mandate;&#13;
(ii)   ensure complementarity in the implementation and in the&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of activities;&#13;
(iii)   redefine the roles of the various services vis a vis the technical&#13;
ministries and donors, in order to better focus and analyse basic&#13;
information.&#13;
a Study Fund (Fonds d'Etudes de Projets), for interministerial use, primarily aimed at&#13;
the economic analysis of all new projects to determine if they are economically viable,&#13;
provided that rate of return analysis is applicable, or to explore least cost alternatives, or&#13;
the rationale for government intervention. The economic analysis will also verify the&#13;
consistency of the proposed project with macroeconomic and sectoral strategies, and&#13;
assess its impact on imports, employment, debt, and generated recurrent costs. The&#13;
primary responsibility for preparing an economic analysis will remain with the sectoral&#13;
ministry. Although this analysis might be financed by a donor, the responsibility&#13;
remains with the Directorate for Public Investment to verify that it is satisfactory. The&#13;
study fund will be used to finance additional economic studies when the initial study is&#13;
not decisive or convincing. It will also review projects which have been on-going for a&#13;
long time in order to determine whether they are still valid and consistent with the&#13;
economic strategy of the country. The study fund will also finance economic studies of&#13;
programs, with the objective of redefining them to make them consistent with sectoral&#13;
strategies and focus on priority expenditures.  Moreover, it will support ex-post&#13;
evaluations of projects, as well as empirical analysis of recurrent costs and the&#13;
development impact of projects. Every year, the DGP and the CSP will prepare an&#13;
annual program of studies for the next year to be agreed with the Bank.&#13;
* assistance to the Directorate for Public Investment (Direction des Investissements&#13;
Publics) to improve sectoral policy design, expenditure management, and the&#13;
implementation of the PIP and PEPs. In 1996, four ministries (Agriculture, Public&#13;
Works, Education and Health) will be assisted in reviewing expenditures with an eye&#13;
toward confirming their consistency with sectoral policies and determining the allocation&#13;
of operational, investment, and recurrent expenditures in the 1997 budget. The other&#13;
main ministries are slated for similar assistance during 1997. The specific objectives are&#13;
to finalize a PEP preparation manual, train personnel in technical Ministries, revise&#13;
budgetary procedures in order to integrate the PEPs fully into the preparation of the&#13;
budget and PIP, and rationalize the physical monitoring of PIP execution;&#13;
*  assistance to support the Programming and Monitoring Units (Correspondants&#13;
Sectoriels) of the technical ministries, under guidance from the Direction des&#13;
Investissements Publics, elaborate sector policies and the strategies to implement them;&#13;
*  technical assistance aimed at developing a Manualfor Project Evaluation and training&#13;
staff at the DGP and the concerned technical ministries; follow up and implementation&#13;
would be monitored by a national consultant.&#13;
*  Support to the Project Monitoring Committee (Comite de Suivi des Projets/CSP) whose&#13;
activities are complementary to that of the Sectoral Reform Committee (Comite des&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
13&#13;
Reformes Sectorielles (CORES) of the Technical Secretariat for Adjustment (STA) in&#13;
terms of equipment and training of cadres.&#13;
*   Support for the publication of economic information aimed at having an impact on&#13;
investment (public sector and private sector) in the national economy.&#13;
Performance indicators for the finance and planning components have been specified as follows:&#13;

1. Civil Service Reform&#13;
Introduction and Overview&#13;
35.    Profile of the Civil Service. The civil service in Madagascar has shrunk to a relatively&#13;
modest size, representing approximately 1% of the population. Over the last 15 years, civil&#13;
service salaries have decreased significantly in real terms. Geographically, civil servants are&#13;
highly concentrated: 40,000 employees work in Antananarivo, the capital city, and another&#13;
10,000 in Antananarivo Faritany, the surrounding province. Two-thirds are employed in health&#13;
and education services, the government's declared priority sectors. Due to the hiring freeze&#13;
decided in 1991 and previous financial constraints, the civil service population is aging. The&#13;
average age is 47; 54% of civil servants are over 45; 97% are over 35; and 28% over 55, the&#13;
legal age for retirement. Since no career development plans exist, favoritism and routine&#13;
promotions have an outsized influence. Responsibilities are often not clearly defined, and&#13;
decision making is too centralized. Over the last years, the situation of the aging, underpaid and&#13;
understaffed civil service has been deteriorating, fostered by a populist new civil service statute&#13;
adopted in 1993 which almost eliminates performance incentives. The government is well aware&#13;
of these problems and favors a more participatory approach to civil service reform, based on&#13;
self-evaluation and an active role of civil servants in solution finding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
Objectives and Strategy&#13;
36.    The proposed project would assist the government in (i) creating a forum for identifying&#13;
issues for which a political decision will be necessary and (ii) the organization of workshops&#13;
with broad participation which will help consensus building and solution finding within the civil&#13;
2&#13;
service. Concepts identified in a Bank report issued in 1991 , such as administrative efficiency,&#13;
sound performance and upgraded human resources would guide this effort, with the objective of&#13;
bringing about a better qualified, better paid and motivated civil service, as a basis for an&#13;
effective, decentralized government better suited to the changing role of the state and its new&#13;
tasks and responsibilities.&#13;
37.    An initial national workshop championed by a high level politician (Prime Minister)&#13;
would take place to review the reform agenda proposed in the 1991 report updated to incorporate&#13;
new developments -- with the objective of determining a reform agenda in line with a short- and&#13;
medium-term strategy. This would be followed by four sectoral and six regional workshops.&#13;
Sectoral workshops would concentrate specifically on social sector ministries which employ&#13;
70% of civil servants and the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Public Works, the&#13;
Departments of Finance and Budget and the Ministry of Interior and Decentralization, which&#13;
play an important role in remuneration and management of civil servants, respectively. The&#13;
regional workshops would be designed to undertake an in depth analysis of problem areas&#13;
selected in the national workshop and to develop short and medium term action plans. This&#13;
approach will be complemented by a pilot diagnostic study for the ministries of health, education,&#13;
agriculture and public works (for which the reallocation of responsibilities to the local level is&#13;
highly important) on how to effect and manage a transfer of responsibilities to the decentralized&#13;
level and implement an incentive related personnel management system. These studies will be&#13;
conducted in close coordination with efforts underway in those ministries under sectoral projects.&#13;
The participatory approach would culminate in a final national workshop, again headed by the&#13;
Prime Minister, which would present solutions and action plans with a detailed timetable of actions&#13;
and expected results. Proposals will be formulated as part of an overall strategy for civil service&#13;
reform and will result in proposed laws and decrees for the Government to propose for adoption by&#13;
Parliament.&#13;
38.    The main workshop topics are: (i) role, organization, and operations of government; (ii)&#13;
how to redirect the public administration toward a focus on service delivery and result orientation;&#13;
(iii) how to guarantee staff competency through initial vocational training, recruitment, appropriate&#13;
incentives, career management, and in-service training; (iv) duties and obligations of civil servants;&#13;
and (v) administrative and financial management of civil service personnel. The government has&#13;
already set many of the workshop rules of procedure. Specific outcomes of these workshops could&#13;
be: a proposal for an improved performance related incentive structure in the civil service, a&#13;
national or sectoral training program(s), a proposal for the redeployment of civil servants in line&#13;
with priority needs.&#13;
39.    Three groups will participate in the workshops: the State (as employer); representatives&#13;
of government workers' organizations (workers' unions and other civil servant professional&#13;
organizations) and the representatives of the public service users; representatives of the National&#13;
Assembly, domestic and foreign businesses, NGOs, and international agencies, will all&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
participate. In addition, each ministry will appoint its staff to attend. One danger, however, is&#13;
that the workshops could be monopolized by government workers complaints. To forestall this,&#13;
the Ministry of Civil Service plans to prepare a detailed information package which will help&#13;
civil servants to understand key issues and to take a responsible approach towards the&#13;
participation process. The Government will also use the workshops as a vehicle to coordinate&#13;
donor programs.&#13;
40.    As regards the above-mentioned diagnostic study in health and education, first existing&#13;
audits of the two ministries will be reviewed; then, the study team will quickly make specific&#13;
proposals for restructuring, redeployment of functions and personnel management, and&#13;
modification of operating practices and procedures. In the Malagasy context of decentralization&#13;
and deconcentration, the latter implying the relocation of government agencies from the capital to&#13;
regional circonscriptions, the team will also update personnel census figures for those two key&#13;
ministries. It will recommend redeployment of some staff from the center to the periphery, or the&#13;
elimination of central units implementing functions devolved to decentralized governments.&#13;
41.    A special "innovation fund" will be created to help finance reforms at the micro-level. It&#13;
will provide resources to implement the recommendations derived from the workshops and to&#13;
address needs that are identified as the project proceeds. A legal covenant will ensure that funds&#13;
can only be used in line with project objectives subject to IDA approval. The general coordinator&#13;
of the project, in conjunction with the concerned ministries, will coordinate the allocation of&#13;
resources. Fundable sub-projects would include specific studies, training, reorganization of&#13;
administrative services, and computerization.&#13;
Issues to be Addressed&#13;
42.    Government commitment to reform was recently stressed in a general policy statement&#13;
of the Ministry of Civil Service (FOP). The statement cites the goal of "a more efficient, less&#13;
centralized government that is better adapted to change and a diversity of tasks." As mentioned&#13;
above, the government needs to give momentum to reform by assigning an official from the&#13;
highest echelon of government to champion in particular the national workshops.&#13;
43.    It will be important to coordinate the workshops carefully at all three levels.  The&#13;
conclusions from the diagnostic studies on the pilot ministries should be made available as&#13;
quickly as possible, so the two approaches, diagnostic studies and workshop(s), can be closely&#13;
linked.&#13;
44.    Workshop facilitation should be approached with care. The Minister of Civil Service&#13;
will provide one week of training for numerous personnel managers to familiarize them with&#13;
such work, particularly, in the methodology of handling workshops. Facilitators, serving as&#13;
technical assistants/advisers to workshop chairpersons and participants, will work in a&#13;
consultative role. IDA will provide support to the government in selecting facilitators and&#13;
helping in: (i) training workshops moderators; (ii) preparing representatives of the civil service&#13;
for their role in the workshops; and (iii) in coordinating and handling the logistics of the&#13;
operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
Performance Indicators&#13;
45.     Expected outcomes with respect to the pilot studies are the development of a human&#13;
resource management strategy in health, education, civil service and agriculture and the&#13;
reorganization of the ministries in line with the legislation on decentralization. The workshops&#13;
are expected to lead to a national action plan on civil service reform, a new civil service statute&#13;
and the development of transparent performance criteria for civil servant evaluation in at least&#13;
two ministries.&#13;

2. Decentralization&#13;
Introduction and Overview&#13;
47.    The new constitution (approved by referendum in September 1992) states that effective&#13;
decentralization is an essential condition for the harmonious development of the sovereign&#13;
Malagasy people. A new administrative structure encompassing central and local governments&#13;
was laid out in draft legislation presented to parliament, emphasizing the need for effective&#13;
decentralization, and the "deconcentration" of those services and functions which were to remain&#13;
the responsibility of the central Government. Shortly afterwards, the Parliament passed a number&#13;
of laws designed to apply this approach completely and consistently throughout the administration.&#13;
These laws established the following principles: (i) powers were to be assigned to the various&#13;
levels of local government in such a manner that costly and confusing overlaps would be avoided;&#13;
(ii) the costs transferred to local authorities would be funded from their own resources; (iii)-taxes&#13;
were to be specific, to allow for transparency and democratic control; (iv) local governments were&#13;
to be managed by elected officials, without any central intervention other than that provided for by&#13;
jurisdiction.&#13;
48.    Nevertheless, problems arose as a result of the structure imposed by these laws, mainly due&#13;
to a lack of the expertise and technical studies necessary to prepare their implementation. This had&#13;
a negative effect on the viability of the many local government bodies that had been established,&#13;
and the distribution of tasks and resources. A gradual introduction of the decentralization process&#13;
as envisaged by the Government today, should help to address these problems.&#13;
49.   In two reports to the Government (1994 and 1995), the Bank submitted recommendations&#13;
regarding the following: (i) clarification of the distribution of fiscal resources; (ii) the need for&#13;
more realistic budgeting, in particular without increasing the burden on the central government&#13;
budget; (iii) improving collection of the local taxes that had been approved by vote, in order to&#13;
increase local government resources; (iv) enhancing service delivery at local level by improving&#13;
management, modernizing procedures, and (v) privatizing certain activities. The objective was to&#13;
overcome the disadvantages of the previous system by establishing an institutional, administrative,&#13;
and financial framework that would allow local governments to become active players in the&#13;
development of their areas and to deliver their services efficiently.&#13;
50.    According to the constitution, legislative provisions pertaining to local governments were&#13;
supposed to be in place no later than March 1994. A Committee of Experts on Effective&#13;
Decentralization (CEDE) was created in December 1993 and charged with preparing, carrying out,&#13;
and coordinating all necessary studies, and implementing effective decentralization. The first&#13;
municipal elections took place on November 4, 1995. An Interministerial Committee for&#13;
Decentralization and Deconcentration (CIDD) will be created in August 1996 to replace the CEDE&#13;
whose missions have been completed since the elections. The CIDD will be presided by a&#13;
representative from the Prime Minister's Office, and composed of representatives from seven&#13;
technical ministries.&#13;
51.    Thus far, the authorities do not possess sufficient data and technical know-how/means to&#13;
facilitate the smooth transition from a largely centralized government to a self-reliant local&#13;
administration. An institutional framework, covering administrative as well as financial aspects,&#13;
needs to be put in place to ensure the high quality and cost effective provision of local services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
This framework should be designed so that decentralization and "decoli'entration" do not lead to&#13;
the "deconcentration" of central government services in functions that have already been transferred&#13;
to local governments, or are likely to be transferred to them. From a macroeconomic perspective,&#13;
increases in government investment must be supported by mobilizing public savings, especially&#13;
through an increased collection of taxes and an increase in revenue at the local level.&#13;
Objectives and Strategy&#13;
52.    To support the decentralization process the project will: (i) finance studies to help in the&#13;
design and implementation of the decentralization process; (ii) support training of the political&#13;
personnel and higher level staff of the new local governments, and design a training program to&#13;
provide in-depth support for decentralization; (iii) support pilot programs for implementing&#13;
decentralization in a few selected urban centers.&#13;
53.    Studies. The authorities have identified the following set of seven studies needed to guide&#13;
them during the decentralization process: (i) an analysis of the functions transferred to&#13;
decentralized governments and their financial, budgetary, and organizational implications; (ii) a&#13;
review of the structures and methods for fostering the participation of the population and local&#13;
NGOs in local govemment decision-making; (iii) preparation of a specific budgetary and&#13;
accounting framework for local governments; (iv) a study of the modalities of human resource&#13;
management in decentralized governments; (v) an inventory of existing taxes, identification of&#13;
possible new local taxes, and proposals for the introduction of a local tax system; (vi) a study of&#13;
ways of improving the management of municipal services; and (vii) an evaluation and summary of&#13;
the results of the first phase of implementation.&#13;
54.    Training. Politicians, managers and the personnel of the decentralized governments will&#13;
have to exercise their functions in a new institutional environment, and the quality of their training&#13;
will be crucial to the success of decentralization. Training activities will extend beyond the scope&#13;
of the project; however, the latter will contribute to the training effort in the following ways:&#13;
* Seminars for informing and raising the consciousness of mayors and central&#13;
government representatives on the implications of decentralization for local budgets,&#13;
taxes, the management of technical services, and the privatization of local industrial&#13;
and commercial activities;&#13;
* Training of the heads (maires) of the communes, as well as the heads of technical&#13;
departments. The project will concentrate on large and medium-sized communes as&#13;
a priority, and at the same time, will identify potential trainers who could extend the&#13;
training to other local governments;&#13;
* Design of a training plan to fulfill the training needs of local governments in a timely&#13;
manner.&#13;
55.    Pilot operations.  Following the example of the successful overhaul of municipal&#13;
management in Antsirabe, the project would help implement decentralization in a few large cities&#13;
and neighboring communes, in order to provide examples for other local governments and useful&#13;
lessons for the continuation of the operation. The project will assist in putting into place the budget&#13;
and tax administration for those cities, as well as establishing the organizational pattern of city&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
management. To this end, it will provide training, technical assistance and some computer&#13;
equipment.&#13;

3. Legal and Judicial Reform&#13;
Introduction and Overview&#13;
58.    Along with other former French colonies in Africa, Madagascar inherited at&#13;
independence a legal system that was essentially of French origin. But the country also had a&#13;
well-developed system of customary law, both written and unwritten, reaching back to pre-&#13;
colonial days. The judicial sector has been deprived of the human and the physical resources it&#13;
needs to perform its functions.&#13;
The Laws&#13;
59.    General. French law was formally introduced in 1895. In the absence of applicable&#13;
provisions in the modem law, however, Malagasy courts still apply customary-law principles to&#13;
the extent that they are ascertainable, well-established, and not contrary to public order or good&#13;
practices.&#13;
60.    The complex interaction between French and Malagasy law, coupled with the incidence&#13;
of customary law, has created a situation where laws remain a matter of conjecture, thus making&#13;
it difficult for practitioners to apply them correctly. Legislation governing commercial and&#13;
business activities is largely outdated, and laws have not been readily accessible to users. Further,&#13;
there has been no systematic coordination of law reform.&#13;
61.    Commercial Code. The French Commercial Code, introduced in Madagascar in 1895,&#13;
has often been amended by both the French and Malagasy legislatures.  The provisions&#13;
governing bankruptcies and company restructuring were amended in the early 1960s to make&#13;
them more responsive to the modern business environment. Those provisions draw a sharp&#13;
distinction between insolvent debtors who act in bad faith and deserve to be eliminated and&#13;
others who act in good faith and deserve to be supported. The interests of creditors therefore&#13;
receive greater consideration than those of enterprises and their employees.&#13;
62.    The Registre du commerce was established for purely administrative purposes by a law&#13;
dating back to 1919. In the course of time, the law has been amended on numerous occasions to&#13;
allow it to play an increasingly prominent role in the disclosure of infornation pertaining to&#13;
companies. In practice, the registre has been maintained in such a haphazard manner that the&#13;
information it provides is neither complete nor reliable.&#13;
63.    Company Law. The confusing state of company law is attributable as much to the&#13;
scattered state of the legal texts as to inherent shortcomings in the legirslation. Five main types of&#13;
companies are recognized in Madagascar. The Societt en nom collectif and the societt en&#13;
commandite simple are both governed by the Code de Commerce. The Societt anonyme and&#13;
Societe en commandite par actions are governed by a Malagasy law of 1867 as subsequently&#13;
amended and the Societe ta responsabilite limitee by a French law of 1925 as subsequently&#13;
amended. Other types of companies provided for under the law include the societes civiles,&#13;
state-owned enterprises established by statute but operating as societts anonymes, and the so-&#13;
called socialist enterprises, which were created during the socialist era. The laws creating the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
latter have been formally repealed by a 1992 law, which provides for the reconversion of&#13;
socialist enterprises as societe's anonymes.&#13;
64.    Civil Code. The Civil Code was amended in 1966 by a new law on contracts aimed at&#13;
promoting security of transactions and incorporating lessons learned from experience. The new&#13;
law seems to have achieved these objectives but does not, however, cover transport and&#13;
insurance contracts, sales contracts, and other special forms of contracts that are expected to&#13;
flourish in a liberal economic environment. The 1966 law has implicitly repealed all provisions&#13;
of the French Civil Code relating to the general principles of contrac,s. All other provisions of&#13;
the Civil Code remain unchanged.&#13;
65.    Property Law. Title ownership is recognized under Malagasy law, as are other more&#13;
traditional forms of land tenure. The attributes of title ownership replicate those of the Civil&#13;
Code, but with qualifications designed especially to promote the productive use of land. Recent&#13;
statutory and other instruments have severely restricted the rights of foreigners to own&#13;
immovable property in Madagascar, making it virtually impossible for them to have access to&#13;
immovable property, except by means of long term leases not exceeding 50 years in duration.&#13;
66.    Banking Laws. Although banking legislation per se in Madagascar is of relatively recent&#13;
origin, other legislative provisions governing banks are somewhat outdated. Some modern&#13;
techniques used elsewhere to obtain credit are therefore not readily available. Similarly, in the&#13;
absence of specific provisions governing leasing arrangements, there is no systematic recourse to&#13;
leasing in banking transactions. The limited availability of land title registration, coupled with&#13;
the unreliable and haphazard nature of the Registre du commerce, has had the effect of severely&#13;
restricting access to credit based on land title or other forms of security.&#13;
The Institutions&#13;
67.    Organization of the Courts. Court organization is governed by a series of laws adopted&#13;
in the early 1960s, including one governing the establishment of the Supreme Court and the Civil&#13;
Procedure and Criminal Procedure codes. Following adoption of the 1992 Constitution and the&#13;
realignment of some functions formerly vested in the Supreme Court, some of the legal&#13;
provisions may have become obsolete.&#13;
68.    The Constitution establishes an independent judiciary as a separate branch of the State&#13;
(pouvoir judiciaire) and guarantees the independence of judges and magistrates. The two&#13;
institutions responsible for enforcement of independence are the Supreme Court and the&#13;
Constitutional, Administrative, and Financial Court (CAFC).&#13;
69.    Higher Courts. The CAFC combines the Constitutional Court, Conseil d'Etat, and Cour&#13;
des Comptes. The Supreme Court is the highest judicial court of the land. It hears appeals from&#13;
the lower courts, but solely on points of law. It also supervises the judicial courts and ensures&#13;
that judges, magistrates, and other judicial staff comply with the rules of conduct that govern&#13;
their respective branches of the profession.&#13;
70.    Lower Courts. The lower level courts consist of two distinct levels of jurisdiction, first&#13;
instance and appellate. The Court of Appeal hears appeals against decisions of First Instance&#13;
Tribunals.  The First Instance Tribunal consists of  civil, commercial, and social (labor)&#13;
chambers. The social chamber hears disputes arising in the course of employment between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
employers and employees. In civil cases, the judge sits alone; in both commercial and labor&#13;
cases, he is normally assisted by assessors. In civil and commercial cases, decisions of the First&#13;
Instance Tribunals are normally subject to appeal to the Court of Appeal unless the amounts&#13;
involved are relatively small.&#13;
Objectives and strategy&#13;
71.    Introduction. Given efforts to introduce a more liberal economic environment in&#13;
Madagascar, there is growing concern about the unsastifactory state of the legal and judicial&#13;
sectors. The government is fully committed to a strategy that seeks not only to modernize the&#13;
legal system but also to restore the credibility of the judicial process.&#13;
72.    Several studies and seminars on the legal/judicial environment have already taken place,&#13;
including a landmark 1990 seminar on commercial and business laws sponsored by the&#13;
Academie Malgache. In preparation for the proposed project, a diagnostic study of the legal and&#13;
judicial environment was conducted in 1994, followed by a seminar to discuss the findings and&#13;
recommendations. The strategy that is described below results almost exclusively from the&#13;
findings of those earlier studies and seminars.&#13;
73.    Publication of Laws. The govemment has assigined high priority to carrying out an&#13;
inventory of existing commercial and business laws, verifying their continued validity, and&#13;
thereafter publishing them as a complete set for the benefit of all public and private-sector&#13;
employees, judges, magistrates, lawyers and other interested parties.&#13;
74.    Legislative Reform Program. In order to streamline the legislative reform process, the&#13;
government has decided to establish a Business Law Reform Commission, which will have&#13;
primary responsibility for the supervision of the process of revision of business laws. The&#13;
commission will consist of business and business law experts, including representatives of both&#13;
the private and the public sectors. It will collaborate closely with the Ministry of Justice and&#13;
share with it responsibility for the legislative reform process.&#13;
75.    The Ministry of Justice will be responsible for day-to-day coordination of the legislative&#13;
drafting process. The Ministry's Direction des Reformes has been designated to draft legislation&#13;
and act as secretariat to the commission.  The Direction will need to be strengthened&#13;
accordingly. In preparing legislation, the Ministry will follow instructions it receives from the&#13;
commission and other ministries involved.&#13;
76.    Training. Under the present regime, trainee magistrates are required, following their&#13;
university education, to complete a two-year course at the Institut d'Etudes Judiciaires (IEJ).&#13;
There is a growing perception that the IEJ has failed in the training task, at least as far as&#13;
magistrates are concerned. Its course is also open to prospective barristers and legal consultants&#13;
and is thus not particularly geared to the training of magistrates. In any event, due to lack of&#13;
resources, IEJ has all but ceased to exist.&#13;
77.    To ensure proper preparation in this vital area, the government plans to establish an&#13;
Ecole Nationale de la Magistrature et des Greffes (ENMG) for the training and retraining of&#13;
judges, magistrates, paralegals, and other court personnel such as court registrars.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
78.    Commercial Litigation. Many procedural factors contribute to administrative delays.&#13;
Some of the factors are relatively straightforward and can be fixed without much difficulty.&#13;
Others require further studies and consultation. Among those that cause delays: the fact that any&#13;
party may file a suit by simply notifying the tribunal without service of process; exchanges of&#13;
pleadings that take place in open court and invariably result in successive postponements;&#13;
submission of expert reports; and, in labor and commercial cases, failure to mobilize the number&#13;
of assessors required to properly constitute the tribunal.&#13;
79.    Two other sets of issues merit discussion. First, the so-called proportional tax on court&#13;
decisions is generally regarded as too high. The tax acts in effect as a disincentive for both the&#13;
enforcement of judgments and the filing of appeals. Second, the procedures for the execution of&#13;
judgments generate concerns, especially about the effectiveness of the procedures and the&#13;
regulation, training, and fee scales of court ushers.&#13;
80.    Work Environment.  A number of factors, many of them  budget related, have&#13;
combined to undermine the effectiveness of judges and magistrates and sap confidence in the&#13;
justice system. They range from poor salaries to lack of proper transport facilities, equipment,&#13;
and material to inadequate provision of law books and library facilities. The government has&#13;
confirmed its intention to provide judges and magistrates with an appropriate work environment&#13;
conducive to the proper functioning of the justice system.&#13;
81.    A couple of the environment-related factors have wider implications. Lawyers and non&#13;
lawyers alike have questioned the degree of independence the courts enjoy. Such questions&#13;
culminated in a lengthy dispute between the judiciary and the executive branch after the National&#13;
Assembly failed to approve legislation establishing the pouvoir judiciaire.  Although the&#13;
outcome of that debate remainis in the hands of the National Assembly, the government has&#13;
steadily reaffirmed its commitment to the independence of the judiciary.&#13;
82.   In addition, there is growing concern about magistrates' salaries. Present salary levels,&#13;
which are linked to civil service pay scales, are grossly inadequate, ranging from about the&#13;
equivalent of about US$40/month for junior magistrates to the equivalent of about US$ 100 for a&#13;
few of their most senior colleagues. By all accounts, low salaries contribute heavily to the high&#13;
level of corruption that allegedly prevails in the judiciary. The government intends to use all&#13;
available means to improve the conditions of service of judges and magistrates, and has already&#13;
taken the modest step of increasing the housing allowance of magistrates to a more decent level.&#13;
Project Components and Issues to be Addressed&#13;
83.    Legal and judicial reform. The legal and judicial reform component seeks to support&#13;
the government's reform strategy. It consists of the following sub-components:&#13;
(i)    publication of legal information;&#13;
(ii)   reform of existing commercial and business laws;&#13;
(iii)   training;&#13;
(iv)   measures to streamline the litigation process in the lower courts;&#13;
(v)    measures to strengthen the effectiveness of the Ministry of Justice and the court;&#13;
(vi)   a study designed to help establish an adequate arbitration mechanism for&#13;
commercial dispute.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
25&#13;
84.    USAID supported parallel funding will be available (about US$5 million) to finance&#13;
short-term consultancy services for law reform activities, training seminars for private&#13;
practitioners, overseas scholarships, study tours, including training in legislative drafting&#13;
techniques for Ministry of Justice officials, equipment and materials for centers outside the&#13;
capital.&#13;
85.    Publication of legal information. This sub-component involves three distinct activities:&#13;
the publication of laws, the publication of a legal journal, and the rehabilitation of the official&#13;
journal, with the last activity to be financed by USAID. The publication of laws is expected to be&#13;
completed within the first two years of the project period. Compilation and publication will be&#13;
carried out under the overall control of the Direction des Etudes of the Ministry of Justice. For&#13;
reasons of efficiency, and in view of the ministry's limited capability, it will be encouraged to sub-&#13;
contract major portions of this activity to such groups as the Academie Malgache and local firms of&#13;
legal consultants.&#13;
86.    Publication of a legal journal, as of laws, will stimulate legal analytical debate and thus&#13;
provide a useful basis for legal reform. It will involve the publication of a legal periodical,&#13;
including a law review section, a law reporting section, and a section on legislative&#13;
developments.&#13;
87.    The credit will also finance consulting services for the compilation of laws and&#13;
technological tools for establishing and managing a legal information system in the Ministry of&#13;
Justice. During negotiations, the government will need to confirm that it will, prior to the&#13;
beginning of each fiscal year, submit to IDA its work program for compilation and publication,&#13;
and, not later than December 31, 1996, submit to the National Assembly appropriate draft&#13;
legislation authorizing publication.&#13;
88.    Reform of existing commercial and business laws. The proposed project will-support&#13;
the preparation and implementation of a comprehensive program of reform of existing&#13;
commercial and business laws. The Direction des Reformes of the Ministry of Justice will&#13;
undertake the task. Simultaneously, a Business Law Reform Commission will be established to&#13;
supervise the revision of business laws.&#13;
89.    In consultation with the Ministry of Justice, the commission will prepare its proposed&#13;
work program and establish its priorities for the next five-year period. Among the anticipated&#13;
priorities: revision of legislation governing public enterprises and companies, including creation&#13;
of new company forms (groupement d'intr&amp;t economique, socidtd unipersonelle, etc.); review of&#13;
land-tenure legislation, particularly the provisions relating to foreign ownership; revision of the&#13;
Commercial Code, especially the provisions on bankruptcies and company restructuring; review&#13;
of legislation governing the registre du commerce; and review of banking legislation,&#13;
particularly with regard to provisions for granting credit to business enterprises. The work&#13;
program may need to be updated to take account of progress in implementation as well as&#13;
revised legislative-reform priorities.&#13;
90.    The proposed credit will finance the materials, equipment, and short-term consultancy&#13;
services needed to undertake the reform. During negotiations, the government will be required&#13;
to confirm that it will (a) provide the Ministry of Justice with budget resources adequate to the&#13;
task, (b) not later than Board presentation, establish the Business Law Reform Commission, and&#13;
(c) prior to the beginning of each fiscal year, adopt and transmit to IDA for review and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
comments a legislative reform program prepared by the commission in consultation with the&#13;
ministry.&#13;
91.    Training. The project includes support to establish the school for judges, magistrates,&#13;
and other legal and paralegal personnel. Initial training for prospective magistrates will last at&#13;
most six months and will be followed by a period of practical experience in the courts. The&#13;
retraining program for sitting magistrates shall consist of short courses lasting no more than a&#13;
few weeks each and will be designed to enable the entire complement of magistrates to&#13;
participate.&#13;
92.    The school will rely largely on local trainers who the government will recruit and pay.&#13;
Indeed, the entire plan for the school presupposes government allocations that will cover the&#13;
recurrent costs involved. It presupposes also that each year the government will recruit--and pay&#13;
the salaries of--between 25 and 30 trainee magistrates and a corresponding number of trainee&#13;
court registrars.&#13;
93.    For an initial period of about two to three years, the Government will conclude a&#13;
twinning agreement with the French Ecole National de la Magistrature et des Greffes (ENMG)&#13;
for the launching of the school. Under the twinning agreement, the French ENM will provide&#13;
technical assistance both in the preparation of the course curriculum and for the training of local&#13;
trainers. A preliminary study for the establishment of the school has been undertaken to&#13;
determine details of training needs and other modalities, as well as to prepare the draft statutes of&#13;
the proposed school. The study was conducted by the ENM and was completed in March 1996.&#13;
94.    The credit will finance the cost of such technical assistance, as well as textbooks and&#13;
materials, teaching aids and other equipment required for the establishment of the school.&#13;
During negotiations the Government will need to confirm that it will (a) provide adequate annual&#13;
budgetary resources to meet the recurrent costs of the school, (b) not later than June 30, 1996,&#13;
identify adequate physical facilities to host the proposed school, and (c) recruit adequate&#13;
numbers of trainee magistrates and court registrars annually to be admitted to the school.&#13;
95.    Measures to streamline the litigation process in the lower courts. The project foresees&#13;
a number of measures to enhance the courts' capacity to handle commercial cases. They include:&#13;
(a) appointment of judges to supervise the exchange of pleadings and the review of rules&#13;
governing automatic postponements; (b) adoption of revised statutes governing court ushers and&#13;
modernization of their profession as a whole; (c) review of procedures for the execution of&#13;
judgments; (d) introduction of a service-of-process requirement for filing commercial cases; and (e)&#13;
revision of the rules governing constitution of the labor and commercial tribunals.&#13;
96.    Other procedural constraints raise more complex issues, which in turn call for further&#13;
studies or consultations involving other government ministries: e.g., budget implications for the&#13;
Ministry of Finance, Budget and Planning of the proportional tax on court decisions. The&#13;
conditions governing court ushers, as well as their training needs, also require a prior study.&#13;
97.    The government will need to confirm  that it will (a) not later than June 30, 1996,&#13;
commission a study to investigate delays in the judicial process, and (b) subject to acceptance of&#13;
the findings, proceed to implement its recommendations. The credit will finance consultancy&#13;
services for the study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
98.    Measures to strengthen the effectiveness of the courts. Any strategy seeking to&#13;
rehabilitate the justice system and enhance its credibility presupposes that the government will take&#13;
appropriate action to protect the independence of judges and magistrates and ensure that they can&#13;
exercise their functions solely in accordance with the law; the government is committed to do that.&#13;
In addition, the government must pay them a salary commensurate with their status and role in&#13;
society and provide them with facilities conducive to the proper exercise of their functions. -&#13;
99.    Under the project, the government plans to commission a study to review every aspect of&#13;
the remuneration of magistrates, including travel and housing benefits, and to follow up with&#13;
recommendations. The study, conducted by a panel of experts representing various sectors, will&#13;
give due regard to civil service pay scales and benefits. In the meantime, the government&#13;
increased, effective January 1, 1996, the housing allowance of magistrates from its present level&#13;
of FMG 15,000 - 25,000 to FMG 500,000, but only for those magistrates who do not enjoy&#13;
official housing facilities.&#13;
100.  In consultation with the judges and magistrates, the government will press for a reporting&#13;
system that requires tribunals to submit such quarterly statistics as the number of cases entered&#13;
and disposed of and the number pending for an inordinate length of time (together with the&#13;
reasons for such delays). The results will be used to trigger the automatic release of&#13;
performance-based incentive payments to the tribun-als who achieve the highest level of&#13;
performance. Such payments should motivate tribunals to clear their backlog of outstanding&#13;
court cases and thus secure a higher level of performance.&#13;
101.   Other measures envisaged under the proposed project include: (a) provision of materials&#13;
and equipment for the benefit of judges and magistrates, including provision of revised editions&#13;
of existing laws; (b) strengthening of the greffes and the registre du commerce, including&#13;
modernization of the services that they provide; and (c) reconstitution and expansion of library&#13;
facilities. A preliminary technical study will be required to determine with sufficient precision&#13;
the technological needs of the greffes and the registre du commerce, and to make&#13;
recommendations accordingly. Prior to disbursement of funds under the credit, the Government&#13;
will need to satisfy IDA that it has established adequate rules to control access-to law library&#13;
facilities, and has taken all other measures necessary to ensure the safe keeping of books and&#13;
periodicals procured under the proposed project.&#13;
102.   The credit will finance equipment materials and library facilities, as well as consultancy&#13;
services for the proposed requirements study for the greffes and the registre du commerce.&#13;
During negotiations the Government will need to confirm that it will (a) not later than June 30,&#13;
1996, commission a study on all aspects of the remuneration of magistrates; (b) make adequate&#13;
budgetary allocations generally for the proper administration of the courts and, in particular, to&#13;
take into account the proposed increase in the amount of the housing allowance, as well as the&#13;
proposed performance-based incentive payments.&#13;
103.   Arbitration. Arbitration offers a unique opportunity for businesses to have their&#13;
commercial disputes resolved outside the courts. Arbitration procedures are provided for under the&#13;
Civil Procedure Code but not widely employed. Under the project, the government will take steps&#13;
to encourage its broad and systematic use. A study will explore the adoption of more detailed&#13;
arbitration rules and procedures and the establishment of arbitration facilities. The credit will&#13;
finance consultancy services for the study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Performance Indicators&#13;
104.   Performance will be measured as follows:&#13;

C. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
a. Project benefits&#13;
106.   The proposed project would assist Madagascar at a critical time in improving the&#13;
functioning of Government. It would help to lay the ground for a new approach to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
29&#13;
government's role in the economy by strengthening dialogue between the government,&#13;
administration and private sector and by contributing to a more effective civil service and&#13;
judiciary, both of which are needed for a successful transition to a liberal economy.&#13;
In summary, the project will benefit economic and social development by:&#13;
*  contributing to a broader based implementation of the adjustment program due to its&#13;
internalization within the administration, private sector and civil society and wider&#13;
consultation and coordination between ministries on policy measures;&#13;
*  improving the environment for savings and investment as a result of increased&#13;
private sector confidence due to a more transparent legal framework and a more&#13;
efficient functioning of the judiciary;&#13;
*  increasing the effectiveness of economic policies due to more timely and accurate&#13;
statistical information and a stronger focus on monitoring poverty indicators.&#13;
Even in the absence of an adjustment program, the project would be critical to improving public&#13;
administration and building-up the capacity to elaborate and implement economic and&#13;
institutional reforms. In the past the dialogue pursued. under the EMSAP project has been&#13;
instrumental in fostering key reforms and avoiding back-tracking.&#13;
b. Project risks&#13;
107.  The strategy for change in public sector management and governance may encounter&#13;
political resistance from vested interests.  In contributing to improved governance, efforts&#13;
involving decentralization and reform of the civil service and judiciary naturally come under&#13;
political attack. Experience has shown that countries with unsettled political and fragile&#13;
institutional environments present high risk factors with respect to the successful implementation&#13;
of capacity building projects. The continuing political uncertainty, including recent changes in&#13;
personnel in the Ministries of Finance, Budget and Planning hence add to project risks. Also, the&#13;
full benefits of the project may take a long time to materialize and there is a risk that the&#13;
commitment to reform may not be sustained long enough to provide lasting results. The risks&#13;
involved in the legal and judicial component arise principally from the failure of all parties&#13;
concerned to agree on a new definition of judicial independence, as provided under the&#13;
Constitution. Now that there is a new government in place, there are hopeful signs that the issue&#13;
is about to be resolved.  Unless it can be resolved satisfactorily, there are risks that the&#13;
component may not be able to achieve fully its objectives, and may have to be scaled down&#13;
accordingly.&#13;
108.   To help reduce the above risks, strong efforts have been made to encourage and help the&#13;
project constituency to ensure a larger political consensus through close consultations with&#13;
various stakeholders, including politicians in the government and the opposition, magistrates and&#13;
other members of the legal professions, as well as private sector associations. The government&#13;
has shown a capacity and commitment to reform by creating the STA and giving the institution&#13;
the means to effectively coordinate the adjustment program, by improving its expenditure&#13;
program and by taking unpopular but crucial measures in the macroeconomic field. Also,&#13;
project risks have been reduced by assigning responsibility for the overall coordination of the&#13;
project to the Prime Minister's office.  The project has been designed flexibly to allow&#13;
reassessment of issues and progress in light of long-term objectives as the project progresses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
30&#13;
These risks of limited government capacity have been addressed through extensive training and&#13;
the creation of a flexible "innovation fund" to finance needs and follow up actions determined&#13;
during implementation. Finally, the chances of project success have been enhanced by using an&#13;
experienced project management team.&#13;
SECTION B: PROJECT COST AND ADMINISTRATION&#13;
1. Project Costs and Financing&#13;
109.   Project Cost. The project would be implemented over five years. Total project costs,&#13;

110.   Financing. The proposed IDA Credit of US$13.83 million equivalent would finance:&#13;
100 percent of foreign expenditures; 100 percent of consulting services and training abroad; and&#13;
75% of local costs for remaining categories (excluding taxes). The resulting financing share&#13;
between IDA and the Republic of Madagascar would be 92 percent and 8 percent (4.1 percent&#13;
net of taxes), respectively. The financing plan, which includes taxes and duties, is presented in&#13;

Employment of Consultants and Training&#13;
112.  In order to ensure the satisfactory execution of the project, the Borrower will need to&#13;
agree during negotiations that qualifications, experience, and termns and conditions of&#13;
employment of consultants shall be satisfactory to IDA. Such consultants will be selected in&#13;
accordance with principles and procedures satisfactory to IDA on the basis of the Guidelines for&#13;
the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as Executing Agency,&#13;
published by the Bank Group in August 1981 (the Consultant Guidelines). The model letter-of&#13;
invitation issued by the Bank Group shall be used. For complex, time-based or lump sum&#13;
assignments, the Borrower will employ such consultants under contracts, using the standard form&#13;
of contract for consultants' services issued by the Bank Group, with such modifications as shall&#13;
have been agreed by IDA. Where no relevant standard-eontract documents have been issued by&#13;
the Bank Group, the Borrower will use other forms agreed with IDA prior to launching the&#13;
invitation.&#13;
113.  Prior Review Arrangements. Consultant contracts for individuals up to US$50,000 per&#13;
contract and for firms up to US$100,000 per contract will be subjected to post review, except for&#13;
TORs, sole source contracts and assignment of a critical nature. All consultant contracts above&#13;
these thresholds would be subjected to prior review.&#13;
114.  Training programs have been summarized where applicable under each component.&#13;
As part of annual work programs, each component coordinator would submit for IDA review and&#13;
approval annual training and study tour programs. From the second year the program would&#13;
include an evaluation of the previous year's training program. Expenses for the workshops&#13;
envisaged in the Civil Service component would be reimbursable upon receipt of Statements of&#13;
Expenditures (SOEs).&#13;
Procurement of Goods&#13;
115.  Goods financed under the project include vehicles and spare parts, office equipment, law&#13;
books, demonstration equipment and teaching tools. Most of these goods would be grouped into&#13;
packages costing more than US$100,000 equivalent and procured through ICB procedures, in&#13;
accordance with IDA's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits&#13;
(January 1995). Contracts for goods procured under ICB would total US$1.13 million. Where&#13;
ICB procedures are used, a preferential margin of 15 percent, or the applicable customs duty,&#13;
whichever is lower, over the c.i.f. prices of competing goods would be given to domestic&#13;
manufacturers in accordance with IDA guidelines. The following measures shall be agreed&#13;
during negotiations:&#13;
(i)  the double envelope system of bid opening will not be used. All bids shall be&#13;
opened in public. Bid amounts, names of bidders, presence/absence of bid&#13;
guarantees, discounts and qualifications shall be announced;&#13;
(ii) standard bidding documents published by the Bank shall be used for all ICB.&#13;
116.  Contracts for some office equipment, as well as for publication of legal texts, below&#13;
US$100,000 each, required over a period of time and available locally at competitive prices, for&#13;
which foreign firms would not be interested, not exceeding US$543,700 in aggregate, would be&#13;
procured by NCB, provided that: (i) bids are opened in public; (ii) contracts are awarded to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
33&#13;
lowest evaluated responsive bidder; (iii) a minimum of 30 days is given between availability of&#13;
the bid document and the bid submission deadline; (iv) a minimum of 3 bids are received; and&#13;
(v) foreign bidders are allowed to participate. Goods contracts, including technical manuals and&#13;
teaching aides/materials, each estimated at US$30,000 or less and not exceeding US$0.15&#13;
million in aggregate would be procured by National (US$20,000) or International (US$55,000)&#13;
Shopping (provided that a minimum of 3 quotations is requested from eligible suppliers), and by&#13;
Direct Contracting (US$71,000).  Because of their specialized nature and availability from&#13;
single source, specific law books will be acquired on a sole source basis from the publisher or&#13;
his agent for a total amount of US$770,000. Procurement would be highly concentrated in the&#13;
first and second years of the project.&#13;
117.  Prior Review Arrangements. All goods contraets. above US$50,000 will be subjected&#13;
to prior review in accordance with para. 2 of Appendix I of the Bank Guidelines. Goods&#13;
contracts below this threshold will be subjected to post review in accordance with para. 4 of&#13;
Appendix I of the Bank Guidelines.&#13;
118.  Procurement information will be collected and recorded as follows:&#13;
(a) prompt reporting of contract award information by the Borrower to IDA;&#13;
(b) every six months the Borrower will submit comprehensive reports to IDA&#13;
indicating:&#13;
(i)  updated cost estimates for individual contracts and for the total project,&#13;
including best estimates of allowances for price contingencies;&#13;
(ii) revised timing of procurement actions, including advertising, bidding,&#13;
contract award and completion time for individual contracts; and&#13;
(iii) compliance with aggregate limits on specified methods of procurement.&#13;
(iv) standard procurement times for various procurement steps up to&#13;
contract signing would be agreed during negotiations; in particular all&#13;
contracts must be signed within the original validity periods.&#13;
III. Disbursements&#13;
119.  The IDA Credit is expected to be effective by December 1996 and the project will be&#13;
executed over the following five years as Government wishes to proceed rapidly with its public&#13;
sector reform program and aims to complete activities within that period. The success to-date in&#13;
implementing the overall economic reform program and the already advanced state of a number&#13;
of the proposed project actions indicate that this can be accomplished. Also, it is expected that&#13;
the major part (about 85%) of project implementation (acquisition of materials, workshops,&#13;
studies, surveys) will be concentrated in the first three years. Accordingly, while the average&#13;
disbursement profile for such operations in the Africa Region is seven years, the credit is&#13;
forecast to be implemented over five years and expected to be closed on June 30, 2001.&#13;

120.   Disbursements will be in accordance with procedures outlined in the World Bank&#13;
Disbursement Handbook. The Borrower possesses the ability to process and maintain SOE&#13;
documentation in a manner satisfactory to the Bank. Appropriate accounting and control&#13;
systems are in place. The project coordination unit would claim reimbursement on the basis of&#13;
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) for: (i) goods and equipment contracts less than&#13;
US$100,000; (ii) contracts with consulting firms valued at less than US$100,000; (iii) contracts&#13;
with individual consultants costing less than US$50,000 (including amendments); and (iv)&#13;
operating costs, training, and the workshops envisaged in the Civil Service component of the&#13;
project.&#13;
121.   Special Account and Project Accounts. To ensure that funds for the project are readily&#13;
available and to facilitate disbursements, a special account will be opened in US dollars in a&#13;
commercial bank acceptable to IDA. The authorized allocation of the Special Account will be&#13;
US$500,000. IDA would make an initial deposit of US$250,000 upon credit effectiveness and&#13;
once SDR 2 million is disbursed, the balance of the authorized allocation (US$250,000) would&#13;
be advanced to the special account. Replenishment of the Special Account would be made on&#13;
the basis of monthly applications, supported by full documentation or SOEs, as required.&#13;
Initially, all expenditures of less than $US50,000 would be financed directly from the special&#13;
account and IDA would not accept direct payment or special commitment applications below&#13;
this limit. Once the full initial allocation is advanced, this threshold would rise to US$ 100,000.&#13;
122.   The Government will open in a Bank a project account to cover its counterpart&#13;
contribution to the project. That account will be replenished quarterly. During negotiations, it&#13;
will be agreed that the project account will be located in a financial institution acceptable to IDA&#13;
and that adequate provision for local costs will be included in the annual operating budgets of the&#13;
Government for the Project Coordination Unit, for all expenditures for which the Borrower is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
35&#13;
responsible. An initial deposit (in local currency) by the Government equivalent to US$100,000&#13;
in the project account will be a condition of credit effectiveness.&#13;
IV. Accounting and Auditing&#13;
123.  The Project Implementation Unit (PIU) will establish and maintain, to the satisfaction of&#13;
IDA, separate accounts and records to be used exclusively for the project. The accounts will be&#13;
maintained in accordance with sound and internationally recognized accounting principles and&#13;
practices. The PIU will provide interim and annual financial statements to reflect the financial&#13;
position of the project. Independent auditors acceptable to IDA would audit the project accounts&#13;
in accordance with internationally acceptable auditing principles and in such detail as IDA may&#13;
request. Establishment of a financial management/accounting system for the project and the&#13;
selection of the auditors of the project will be conditions of effectiveness. The audits would be&#13;
undertaken quarterly and annually, on the basis of a three-year contract, with the annual report&#13;
submitted to IDA no later than three months after the close of the year. In addition, the special&#13;
account and all disbursements made on the basis of SOEs would be audited annually and the&#13;
audit reports submitted three months after the end of each audit period.&#13;
SECTION C: IMPLEMENTATION AND MONITORING&#13;
1. Organization and Management&#13;
124.  The Office of the Prime Minister would assume overall coordinating responsibility for&#13;
the project (see organizational chart below).  A Project Director who has already been&#13;
successfully in charge of EMSAP coordination has been appointed to handle day-to-day&#13;
coordination matters, including: the development of an adequate accounting system for project&#13;
implementation, coordination of procurement and disbursement activities for the various&#13;
executing agencies, coordination of annual activity reports and work plans, as well as arranging&#13;
for annual audits of project accounts.&#13;
125.  Management and implementation of each component would be the responsibility of the&#13;
concerned ministries and entities, as follows: Support to the economic reform and management&#13;
component would be managed by the newly created Steering Committee in charge of the reform&#13;
program and the National Statistical Institute; public resource management and planning reform&#13;
would be managed by the Ministry of Ministry of Finance, Budget and Planning, as appropriate;&#13;
the civil service component would be managed by the Ministry of Civil Service; the&#13;
decentralization component would be managed by the Ministry of Interior and Decentralization;&#13;
and the legal and judicial reform component would be managed by the Ministry of Justice. The&#13;
legal and judicial component will not create any new entity or unit. It will be implemented by&#13;
existing personnel in the Ministry of Justice and the courts. The Direction des Etudes and the&#13;
Direction des Reformes have been designated as coordinators on behalf of the ministry. They&#13;
will be assisted by a steering committee of representatives from the judiciary, legal profession,&#13;
teaching staff of the university and the Academie Malgache, and other interested parties. Project&#13;
Component Managers have been appointed within each Ministry to manage the implementation&#13;
of each major component or sub-component.&#13;
126.  A Project Implementation Plan will be prepared to help the project coordinator&#13;
implement and monitor the project. The plan would include all project procedures agreed with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
36&#13;
IDA, standard bidding documents for consultants, the list of consulting services to be procured&#13;
and the type of procurement, detailed project costs, the terms of reference of the studies and&#13;
support services to be carried out, and standard forms for progress reports. An outline of the&#13;
Project Implementation Plan will be agreed during negotiations, and the plan should be&#13;
completed as a condition of credit effectiveness.&#13;
II. Implementation Schedule&#13;
127.  The implementation schedule of the project (Schedule B) will be agreed during&#13;
negotiations. It was prepared on the assumption that the credit would become effective in&#13;
December 1996 and the project implemented over a five-year period. The credit is expected to&#13;
be closed in June 2001.&#13;
III. Reporting and Monitoring&#13;
128.  The content and timing of progress reports will be agreed during negotiations. Progress&#13;
reports would be prepared quarterly and in advance of each Bank supervision mission. The&#13;
reports would review progress on financial execution and studies. The Borrower would submit&#13;
an Implementation Completion Report to IDA no later than six months after the closing date of&#13;
the credit.&#13;
IV. Supervision Plan&#13;
129.  The six components included in the project will require intensive supervision, estimated&#13;
at about 24 staffweeks (sw) per year during the first two years and about 20 sw/year thereafter.&#13;
As a number of departments are involved in the supervision and implementation process&#13;
(technical department, legal department and country department), an average of 7 sw per year&#13;
are expected to be spent by Bank staff at headquarters, with the rest consisting of field missions&#13;
and resident mission input. Resident mission staff would be involved in project supervision&#13;
where possible to ensure continuity and quick response to requests from project and sub-&#13;
component managers. Procurement documents, terms of reference and reports (progress, final,&#13;
studies, financial statements) would be reviewed at Bank headquarters. A supervision plan is&#13;
included in Annex B.&#13;
V. Mid-term Review&#13;
130.  Not later than December 31, 1998, the project coordinator should prepare and hold a&#13;
mid-term review of the project execution. The review would be organized in collaboration with&#13;
the Ministry of Economy and Planning in its overall coordinating capacity, the executing&#13;
agencies, and IDA's supervision mission. The review process would include progress in meeting&#13;
project objectives, overall project performance against established and agreed key performance&#13;
indicators, and performance of consultants under the Project. The mid-term review would&#13;
provide the opportunity for IDA to assess the Government's continued commitment to the&#13;
project's objectives. During negotiations, an agreement will be reached with the Borrower with&#13;
regard to the carrying-out of a mid-term review and to its objectives.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
MADAGASCAR&#13;
PUBLIC MANAGEMENT CAPACITY BUILDING PROJECT&#13;
D-ECLARATION OF GOVERNMENT STRATEGY&#13;
FOR PUBLIC SECTOR REFORM&#13;
Introduction&#13;
I .    The Government of Madagascar views the modernization and strengthening of government&#13;
services as one of the cornerstones of its action program. The success of its economic development&#13;
program largely depends on the successful adaptation of government services to the new role of the&#13;
State. Henceforth, the State will concentrate on its essential functions and devote the bulk of its&#13;
efforts to such priorities as poverty alleviation, primary health care, primary education, domestic&#13;
security, and infrastructure maintenance. It will a'3andon its role as economic agent and will cease&#13;
to wield heavy-handed control over private economic activity.&#13;
2.    The purpose of the Public Management Capacity Building Project is to support this new&#13;
approach. The general objectives of this project are as follows:&#13;
. Modernize the government agencies by improving their organization, strengthening&#13;
their technical capacities, and developing their human resources, thereby enabling them&#13;
to effectively provide essential public services and support the country's development&#13;
process.&#13;
*  Strengthen capacities for formulating, analyzing, implementing, and communicating the&#13;
Government's economic development strategy, by developing the institutional capacity&#13;
of the units responsible for economic affairs, and by strengthening the economic and&#13;
social information system.&#13;
*  Improve the use of public resources by developing a transparent and efficient system of&#13;
public expenditure management that will facilitate resource mobilization to support the&#13;
essential functions of the State.&#13;
* Modernize the legal system and reform the judicial system, to create a climate of&#13;
confidence and an environment favorable to private investment, and to establish&#13;
conditions conducive to good governance.&#13;
*  Strengthen the democratic process and deepen popular involvement in development&#13;
activities through institutional capacity building within the decentralized authorities,&#13;
enabling them to manage themselves and to fully assume the responsibilities conferred&#13;
upon them by the Constitution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11.   Context of the reform&#13;
3.    The public sector reform project is taking place within the context of an economic&#13;
development program formulated by the Government in its draft medium-tern Policy Framework&#13;
Paper. The principal thrusts of this program are: (a) liberalization of the economy; (b) good&#13;
macroeconomic management; (c) strengthening of human resource capacities; (d) openness to the&#13;
world economy; (e) private sector development; and (f) the alleviation of poverty.  Poverty&#13;
alleviation is the Government's number one priority, which it will aim to achieve both through&#13;
implementation of a strategy for a high and sustainable level of economic growth, and through the&#13;
development of specific and targeted actions in the areas of health, education, and rural&#13;
infrastructure development. The effectiveness and success of structural reforms will largely depend&#13;
on the implementing capacities of the public authorities themselves.&#13;
III.   Specific objectives and actions planned&#13;
1. Strengthening of economic management&#13;
4.    It is essential to strengthen the Government's capacity to prepare and formulate economic&#13;
strategies and analyze their impact so that it can better shape its economic policy instruments and&#13;
adjust them to the real needs of the economy while developing dialogue and consultation with the&#13;
economic agents and the population at large. The specific objectives of this component are:&#13;
*  strengthen the capacity to formulate economic reform programs and monitor their&#13;
implementation;&#13;
* improve communications concerning economic strategy both within the government&#13;
and with the public;&#13;
* restructure the national accounts and the statistical system in order to provide the&#13;
necessary information for management of the economy and of the reform programs.&#13;
Action to achieve these objectives will include strengthening of the Technical Secretariat&#13;
for Adjustment (STA) and the National Institute of Statistics (INSTAT).&#13;
A.    Implementation of economic reforms&#13;
5.    STA component. This covers efforts to reach a nationwide consensus, and the preparation,&#13;
coordination and monitoring of adjustment measures. The STA will be playing a more and more&#13;
important role as coordinator and facilitator in the formulation and monitoring of economic and&#13;
sector policies, with the active support of the two committees already associated with it: the&#13;
Comite de Reformes Macro-economiques et Financieres (COREMEF) and the Comite de Reformes&#13;
Sectorielles (CORES).  In addition, the Groupe  Technique de Travail de l'Initiative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Transfrontaliere will be reconstituted as a third committee of the STA, to be responsible for the&#13;
regional dimension of adjustment.&#13;
6.    The holding of regular meetings, exchanges of information, and sensitization of the&#13;
population to the economic reforns are all key indicators for an evaluation of the outcomes of this&#13;
component. By the end of November 1995, the Government intends to have prepared a plan for a&#13;
communications strategy within the framework of a national communications seminar. It also&#13;
plans, by February 1996, to have short brochures published concerning the adjustment program, for&#13;
distribution to the public at large.&#13;
B.    Development of the National Institute of Statistics (INSTAT)&#13;
7.    INSTAT will improve the production and availability of reliable data to expedite economic&#13;
policy choices, evaluation of the results of the reforms, and any necessary corrections.&#13;
8.    With respect to the national accounts, the objective is to strengthen INSTAT's institutional&#13;
capacities to produce those accounts on a regular basis. The first goal is the preparation of the&#13;
1993/1994 base accounts, from which aggregated/light annual accounts can be prepared at short&#13;
notice. The Government confirms its commitment to produce, by April 1996, the semi-definitive&#13;
national accounts for the period 1993/94, and, by December 1996, a methodology for establishing&#13;
simplified accounts.&#13;
9.    The results of the analytical surveys of household living conditions will serve as a basis for&#13;
a number of analytical workshops, some of which will be entrusted with preparing a social&#13;
accounting matrix. To monitor changes in living conditions over time and improve knowledge of&#13;
the poverty profile, INSTAT will start in 1997 to carry out two-year permanent or more selective&#13;
priority surveys. It will undertake each year, at appropriate intervals, to publish social indicators as&#13;
a basis for assessment of the impacts of the Structural Adjustment Program.&#13;
10.   Where conjunctural surveys are concerned, these will be carried out two or three times a&#13;
year by a permanent team to be set up by [NSTAT in 1996.&#13;
C.    Financial and planning units&#13;
11.   The Government intends to improve its efficiency, thereby arresting the deterioration of the&#13;
public services, while also curbing government spending. Where the financial and planning units&#13;
are concerned, expenditure programming and budgeting are two aspects desperately in need of&#13;
overhaul. It is vital to ensure the highest possible return on government spending, while channeling&#13;
that spending toward priorities, chief among these being poverty alleviation.&#13;
12.   The principal objectives are:&#13;
(i)   increase transparency and rationality in the allocation and use of budgetary sources;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(ii)   assist the authorities to determine priority expenditures and to effect tradeoffs at&#13;
both the intersectoral and the intrasectoral levels;&#13;
(iii)  improve the programming, execution and monitoring of public expenditure;&#13;
(iv)  improve the efficiency  of the Treasury  in order to  strengthen  budget&#13;
implementation, assist with the preparation of periodic public expenditure indicator&#13;
tables, and improve management of the public debt;&#13;
(v)   review the methods of management of the autonomous agencies to ensure that their&#13;
operations and management are more transparent and more consistent with&#13;
budgetary priorities;&#13;
(vi)  streamline the financial management of civil service staffs.&#13;
13.   The following steps will be taken to facilitate all necessary change:&#13;
(i)    The Direction Generale du Plan will carry out supplementary analyses to&#13;
determine whether the proposed projects are consistent with sectoral, regional and&#13;
national economic strategies, whether they have any impact on budgetary&#13;
equilibrium, and whether they are geared to the achievement of priority goals.&#13;
(ii)   The Direction des Investissements Publics and the sectoral ministries will&#13;
improve sector policy design, expenditure management, implementation of the PIP&#13;
and PEPs, and financial and physical monitoring of the PIP. In 1996, four&#13;
ministries (Agriculture, Urban Development, Education and Health) will receive&#13;
assistance to review expenditures in order to determine their consistency with sector&#13;
policies and to decide on the allocation of operational. investment, and recurrent&#13;
expenditures in the 1997 budget. The other ministries are slated to receive similar&#13;
assistance in 1997.&#13;
(iii)   The Direction de l'Evaluation Economique, which in particular supervises the&#13;
Comite de Suivi des Projets, will improve its capacity to monitor project&#13;
implementation, enabling it to cover all large projects (over US$ 10 million) by&#13;
1997.&#13;
(iv)  It will collaborate with INSTAT in designing and preparing a quarterly publication&#13;
containing economic data and information concerning investment projects.&#13;
(v)   The economic and planning departments will need to be reorganized in order to&#13;
streamline human resource allocation and improve coordination with the finance&#13;
and budget departments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(vi)   The Direction du Budget will (a) improve the establishment and implementation of&#13;
the public expenditure program and the monitoring of budget execution, to ensure&#13;
that sector strategies are implemented within the constraints of the macroeconomic&#13;
framework; and (b) undertake an audit of the autonomous public agencies for the&#13;
purpose of making their operations and management more transparent.&#13;
(vii)  The Direction GCtnirale du Tresor will improve the efficiency of its organization&#13;
and personnel, strengthen budget execution, draw up periodic public expenditure&#13;
indicator tables, and improve management of the public debt. A Treasury audit will&#13;
be performed for this purpose.&#13;
(viii)  Starting in 1997, the Direction de la Gestion Financiere du Personnel de l'Etat&#13;
will introduce an efficient system of personnel financial management based on&#13;
improved and simplified payroll processing and management procedures, thereby&#13;
facilitating greater control over the wage bill and providing an overview of the&#13;
principal data concerning civil service expenditures.&#13;
2. Strengthening of governance&#13;
A.    Civil service reform&#13;
14.   The Government has decided to reform the civil service, with the following objectives:&#13;
(i)    adapt human resource management to the new role of the State resulting from&#13;
privatization and decentralization, and to its new organization resulting from&#13;
deconcentration;&#13;
(ii)   provide efficient public services and boost civil servant performance through a&#13;
system  of rewards and sanctions in the areas of career management and&#13;
compensation:&#13;
(iii)  ensure participation by central government workers in the regional planning policy&#13;
[politique d'amenagement du territoire] by seeing that they are evenly allocated&#13;
throughout the country;&#13;
(iv)   enforce observance of the principles of political neutrality and public morality in the&#13;
recruitment and management of civil servants and with respect to their behavior.&#13;
15.   For reasons of efficiency, the Government intends to obtain comments and opinions from&#13;
the administrative hierarchy, from representatives of government staffs, and from users,- concerning&#13;
the content of its proposed policy guidelines and the modalities of their implementation.&#13;
16.   It will proceed to a three-phase course of action:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(a)    Definition by the Government of the principal thrusts of civil service reform.&#13;
(b)    Strengthening of the consultation process through:&#13;
* a study of each of two pilot ministries (Health and Education)&#13;
* a series of national, sectoral and regional workshops designed to inform&#13;
participants of the Government's policy guidelines and to obtain their specific&#13;
proposals and, if possible, their adherence.&#13;
(c)    Definition, following completion of the studies and the national wrap-up seminar, of&#13;
the legal and technical content of the reform, and submission to Parliament of those matters that&#13;
concern it.&#13;
B.    Decentralization&#13;
17.   To deepen democracy and establish more effective conditions within which to satisfy&#13;
local needs. the Constitution makes provision for decentralization, a principle whose application&#13;
will curb the role of the State, enable reductions in budgetary allocations and central government&#13;
staffing, and thus deepen democracy.&#13;
18.   With respect to those responsibilities that are to be retained by the State, the Government&#13;
will apply the principle of deconcentration, thereby shortening the decision-making process.&#13;
19.    Decentralization and deconcentration will be implemented in a coordinated and progressive&#13;
manner.&#13;
20.   In so doing, the Government aims to achieve a fourfold goal:&#13;
(i)    Given the extent of the needs that it will still have to fuifill, and given the budgetary&#13;
situation, decentralization and deconcentration will have to be implemented at zero&#13;
cost to the State budget.&#13;
(ii)    The decentralized local governments will need to have access to resources&#13;
consistent with their new responsibilities. Consequently, as the State hands over its&#13;
various responsibilities, it will also transfer the resources formerly available to it to&#13;
finance the functions concerned. It also believes it is necessary to improve the&#13;
effective yield of approved local taxes.&#13;
(iii)  In practice. responsibilities and the corresponding resources need to be clearly&#13;
distributed between the State and each level of local government, both for&#13;
operational reasons and to ensure a transparent democratic process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(iv)   The principles of decentralization and deconcentration need to be very clearly&#13;
stated. In particular, no new regional units of the central government should be&#13;
created, even if that was formnerly intended as part of the transfer of responsibilities&#13;
already or about to be transferred to the local authorities: Instead, any existing units&#13;
should be eliminated once the responsibilities have been effectively transferred to&#13;
the local authorities.&#13;
21.    To this end, the Government envisions a three-pronged approach, whose facets are closely&#13;
intertwined:&#13;
(i)    A  series of studies on the allocation and clarification of responsibilities, the&#13;
deconcentration of units and functions, local taxation, the instruments of a modem&#13;
and efficient local government, and human resource management within the local&#13;
authorities. Such studies need to form a coherent whole and include an overview&#13;
and evaluation of the first phase, that of decentralization to the communes. It is&#13;
essential that the Government have access to this overview and evaluation before it&#13;
goes on to the later stages of decentralization to the other local government levels.&#13;
(ii)    Training of local government staffs in higher-level positions, since the rules and&#13;
principles of good management will obviously have no effect if those applying them&#13;
are not fully familiar with them.&#13;
(iii)   Six pilot operations in urban communes with significant fiscal potential; this action&#13;
will not only support the operations of those communes themselves, but also,&#13;
through its demonstration effect, be of assistance to the other communes.&#13;
22.    The Government will take the following steps:&#13;
(i)    It will ensure the system's cohesion by expanding the role of the committee of&#13;
experts on effective decentralization to include issues of deconcentration, will make&#13;
the committee's prior opinion a mandatory requirement, and review the committee's&#13;
composition in light of its expanded role. Those decisions will be taken by decree&#13;
and set down in a letter of mission from the Prime Minister to the committee&#13;
chairman.&#13;
(ii)   It will create a local finance commission bringing together local elected local&#13;
officials and representatives of the government services to ensure the transparency&#13;
of transfers of responsibilities and resources and exchanges of information.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
C.    Reform of the legal system and of business law&#13;
23.   The adoption of a new policy to liberalize the economic system has focused attention on the&#13;
importance of the legal and judicial framework affecting the business sector. A number of studies&#13;
and seminars have been conducted concerning the legislation in this area.&#13;
24.   Those studies and seminars have revealed that a large part of the applicable legislation is&#13;
outdated, going back as far as the colonial period. Some of the legislative texts have never been&#13;
reformed, and are consequently unsuited to present-day circumstances. Others were amended or&#13;
revised through the addition of certain provisions subsequent to independence.  Even so. no&#13;
systematic effort was made to coordinate those new provisions with the old ones.&#13;
25.   Despite the importance assigned by the Constitution to independence of the judiciary, in&#13;
several areas the institutions involved in that branch have little credibility. This is because of the&#13;
persistent neglect of the legislative provisions in those particular areas. and also because of the&#13;
Government's long-standing role as sole arbiter of the country's economic activities.&#13;
26.   Within the context of its policy aiming to stimulate initiative and promote the private sector,&#13;
the Government intends to adopt all necessary measures to rehabilitate the appropriate legal and&#13;
judicial institutions and restore their credibility. Among those measures, the Government is firmly&#13;
resolved to make available to the Ministry of Justice and the judicial institutions the resources&#13;
essential to the achievement of their objectives.&#13;
27.   To this end, the Government has already set up a business law reform commission to&#13;
supervise and coordinate the legislative drafting process. This commission will be working in&#13;
liaison with the Ministry of Justice and the other ministries concerned, with a view to the&#13;
preparation of new laws and regulations. The commission and the Ministry of Justice will together&#13;
draw up a five-year timetable for business law reform. The primary focus will be reform of the&#13;
investment credit law, involving a radical overhaul of commercial securities and publicity, of&#13;
company and business group law, of land law and labor law, and of the rules of bankruptcy and&#13;
procedures governing court supervised restructuring of companies. Faced with the tasks of&#13;
implementing legal reforms and drafting new legislation, the Ministrv of Justice will need to hire&#13;
additional staff and take on consultants to meet its necessary complement of human resources, and&#13;
will also need to have access to the requisite material resources.&#13;
28.   To improve the prestige and restore the credibility of the judicial institutions, a special effort&#13;
will be made to improve the working conditions, environment, and material resources of those&#13;
employed within the judicial system. To this end, the Government undertakes both to ensure their&#13;
independence and freedom of activity and to protect them against arbitrary professional sanctions.&#13;
29.   Upgrading of the status of judges and improvement of their work environment also depend&#13;
on the availability of material resources. A study of the material circumstances and incomes of the&#13;
country's judges should be conducted without delay. In the meantime, a measure to substantially&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
increase the housing allowance of those judges who are not provided with government housing will&#13;
take effect on January 1, 1996.&#13;
30.   The wheels of justice generally grind very slowly, a fact that tends to discredit the judicial&#13;
system. To encourage judges to be diligent, the Government intends to introduce a performance&#13;
bonus, to be awarded on the basis of clearly defined criteria. Application of those criteria should&#13;
provide the necessary incentive for courts to improve upon their performance..&#13;
31.   As part of the effort to promote and modernize the judicial system, new facilities and new&#13;
resources will be granted to make library facilities available to the judges, whether they be trial&#13;
judges or magistrates attached to the Ministry of Justice. [magistrats du siege et du parquet]. A&#13;
law review will also be established, which will periodically publish the principal court decisions&#13;
and the principal laws and decrees that have recently been enacted, together with comments by&#13;
legal scholars or theorists.&#13;
32.   In addition, every possible effort will be made to improve the operation of the courts, in&#13;
such areas as exchanges of pleadings [mise en etat des affaires] and summary proceedings in cases&#13;
of urgency [uridiction des referes qui statue sur les cas d'urgence]. Measures will also be taken to&#13;
lessen the difficulties of enforcement of court decisions. To that end, a study will be conducted&#13;
with a view to modifying the laws applicable to those areas within the framework of a new judicial&#13;
procedure.  This study will focus in particular on the advisability of eliminating the taxe&#13;
proportionnelle, one of the main reasons for the excessively slow process of enforcement of court&#13;
decisions. Lastly, a school for judges will be established [Ecole de la Magistrature], to facilitate&#13;
the hiring and training of new judges. This school will also provide conhinuing training for existing&#13;
judges and court officials (targeting clerks of the court in particular). The Government undertakes&#13;
to provide the school with the necessary resources to ensure its sustained and continuing operation.&#13;
IV.   Organizational and institutional aspects&#13;
33.   The Government attaches the greatest importance to the success of the institutional reform&#13;
and public sector capacity building project. It therefore finds it essential to set up a system that will&#13;
ensure the coordination and efficient management of the project, both overall and where each&#13;
individual component is concerned. The project comes under the responsibility of the Ministry of&#13;
Finance and Budget, who will appoint a General Project Coordinator to ensure that its&#13;
implementation adheres to the Government's guidelines. Each of the seven components will come&#13;
under the auspices of the ministry concerned, and will be coordinated by a senior official appointed&#13;
for the purpose, who will be responsible for its implementation. The Government will entrust the&#13;
project's financial management to a Project Unit managed by a Project Director, to coordinate&#13;
procurement, disbursements, accounts, and auditing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
VI.   Conclusion&#13;
34.   The public sector reform and capacity building project is consistent with the Government's&#13;
economic program and will support the Government's efforts to restructure the public sector and to&#13;
endow it with the dynamism and efficiency essential to the success of the economic reform&#13;
program and of the strategy to boost the country's economic development.&#13;
35.   The project will contribute to capacity building of the capacity within both the central and&#13;
the decentralized local governments, rendering them more capable of performing their respective&#13;
functions and of ensuring greater participation by the people and the communities in the preparation&#13;
and implementation of development strategies.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Public Management Capacity Building
            Project will provide assistance to the government of
            Madagascar in the areas of economic management and public
            administration. Its objectives include: (A) to improve the
            government's capacity to design and implement an
            economic reform program and contribute to a sharper focus on
            poverty alleviation in allocating public resources; and (B)
            to facilitate a fiscally responsible implementation of the
            decentralization process, foster participation in local
            planning and management of the development process, catalyze
            consensus building on civil service reform within the
            administration, and improve the security of business
            transactions. The project components are to: (1-4) provide
            support to the Technical Secretariat for Adjustment, the
            National Statistical Institute, the Departments of Finance
            and Budget, and the Departments of Planning and Economy; (5)
            reform civil service; (6) decentralize the government; (7)
            reform the judiciary; and (8) strengthen the Project
            Management Unit.
