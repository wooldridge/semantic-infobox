    Date: November 15, 1989&#13;
       Washington, D.C.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              1&#13;

                                            NOTE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The following are notes of an oral interview conducted by the authors of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
fiftieth anniversary history: John P. Lewis, Richard Webb and Devesh Kapur, The World Bank:&#13;
Its First Half Century, Washington, DC: Brookings Institution Press, 1997. The World Bank&#13;
Group Archives has neither a full transcript nor a tape of the interview, only these notes that&#13;
were prepared by the authors after the interview. Nevertheless, the World Bank Group Archives&#13;
believes that these notes may be of interest to researchers and makes them available for public&#13;
use.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                                    2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Presidents matter a lot. [Robert S.] McNamaraâ&#128;&#153;s top down culture still persists in the&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#148;not much decentralization as yet.1&#13;
&#13;
       [Barber B.] Conable will go down as the â&#128;&#149;environment and sustainable developmentâ&#128;&#150;&#13;
president.&#13;
&#13;
         Decade of the 1970â&#128;&#153;s: Basic Needs&#13;
&#13;
         Decade of the 1980â&#128;&#153;s: Structural Adjustment&#13;
&#13;
         Decade of the 1990â&#128;&#153;s: Sustainable Development&#13;
&#13;
        With the last decade the Bank has [seemingly] served notice of not/less heavily&#13;
discounting the future; it is now arguing that there are no trade-offs between growth and the&#13;
environment. However, on this issue as well as others [involving a strong thinking about the&#13;
future] e.g. population planning there is not much intellectual leadership. The extent of influence&#13;
onto the operations side is still very limited. [This may indicate the inertia the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
organization has; obviously the reorganization has not made the translation of the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s policy&#13;
directives into operations a simpler or easier task. On the other hand it could also indicate that&#13;
the policy was never meant to be implemented too seriously.]&#13;
&#13;
        As an analogy it is very difficult to sharply change a large tankerâ&#128;&#153;s direction of&#13;
movement; in particular when it is not growing it means that changes can only be done by&#13;
reallocation of resources [implying that those that lose resources are bound to resist such moves].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
REORGANIZATION.&#13;
&#13;
        Recommends a look at the reports of the three task forces on reorganization: PPR&#13;
[Policy, Planning and Research] , operations and â&#128;&#149;othersâ&#128;&#150; [?]. The consulting groupâ&#128;&#153;s influence,&#13;
she felt, was limited once the reorganization [began?].&#13;
&#13;
       The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s problems [of limited/no growth and reorganization as â&#128;&#149;structural&#13;
adjustmentâ&#128;&#150;] have mirrored some of those of the LDCâ&#128;&#153;s [less developed countries] in the 80s.&#13;
The shift from investment lending to SAL [structural adjustment lending]â&#128;&#148;see as a bribe to&#13;
LDCâ&#128;&#153;s to induce them to change their ways.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
SOME FURTHER SPECULATIONS:&#13;
&#13;
         -Golden age of Bank is probably over.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1&#13;
 Original notes by Brookings Institution World Bank history project; original insertions are in [ ]. Insertions added&#13;
by World Bank Group Archives are in italics in [ ] .&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        -Competition with Regional Banks: may be a good thing but clients may play them off&#13;
against each other [but is that not intrinsic to the very notions of â&#128;&#149;competitionâ&#128;&#150; â&#128;&#147; surely the Bank&#13;
does not see restricting competition in economies because customers may play off firms against&#13;
each other!]&#13;
&#13;
        -Bank is a large organization and somewhat [empty space] so not it is more flexible on&#13;
SALs.&#13;
&#13;
       -Evolving role of Bankâ&#128;&#148;may be worthwhile to examine the recent MOU [memorandum&#13;
of understanding] between the Bank and the IMF [International Monetary Fund].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        Differentiation in lending across regions may reflect the proclivities of the staff manning&#13;
these regions [rather than explicit policy?]&#13;
&#13;
        AFRICA: major restructuring and the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s large role [has meant that] the division is&#13;
fairly dynamic.&#13;
&#13;
        ASIA: pretty much stodgy&#13;
&#13;
       LATIN AMERICA: societies are much more open [relative to? . . Africa?] S. E. Asia?&#13;
South Asia? India?], more complex. More players involved in the decision-making process so&#13;
Bank has less [relative] influence.&#13;
&#13;
        -   The energy/influence of the McNamara period is now dissipating [compare opening&#13;
            lines]. There is more decentralization now.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PRESIDENT:&#13;
&#13;
       Some of the nuances of changes in the Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s power and how it has been exercised&#13;
may be captured by examining the evolution of the budget process and the manner in which he is&#13;
appointed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Bankâ&#128;&#153;s limited growth has mixed portend:&#13;
       Good: with less growth, thereâ&#128;&#153;s more concern about quality.&#13;
       Bad: with less growth, less easy to change.&#13;
&#13;
Context in which the Bank operates has changed.&#13;
      Donors: Decline of U.S. hegemony and multipolar international context with West&#13;
Europe and Japan emerging as two equally significant actors.&#13;
      Recipients: Much more differentiation.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            In November 1989, Nancy Birdsall was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by John P. Lewis, Richard Webb, and Devesh
            Kapur. This report contains the notes of that oral
            interview. During her tenure at the Bank from 1979 to 1993,
            Mrs. Birdsall worked in the following areas: in the
            development economics department as an economist
            (1979-1982); in the country policy department as a senior
            economist (1982-1984); in the population, health, and
            nutrition department, policy and research division, as chief
            (1984-1987); in the Brazil department, population and human
            resources, operations division, as chief (1987-1990); in the
            Latin American region department, environment division as
            chief (1990-1991); and in the policy research department as
            director (1991-1993). Her transcript notes changes of the
            World Bank during the decades of the 1970s, 1980s, and
            1990s, concerning basic leadership needs, structural and
            departmental adjustment, and sustainable development,
            respectively. She discusses recommendations for
            reorganization and states that the &#147;golden age&#148; of the bank
            is probably over.
