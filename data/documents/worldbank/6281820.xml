 Introduction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Washing hands with soap could save a million lives. Eighteen months ago, a small team from&#13;
  the Water and Sanitation Program, the World Bank and the London School of Hygiene and&#13;
  Tropical Medicine set out to answer the following question:&#13;
&#13;
  "Can the expertise and resources of Industry and Governments be coupled to design and deliver&#13;
  large-scale, high-impact handwash promotion programs?"&#13;
&#13;
  A year and a half on, public-private partnerships for handwashing with soap are in place in&#13;
  Ghana and Kerala, and full-scale handwash promotion programs have been designed. Other&#13;
  countries are set to join the initiative. This document outlines the approach that was taken, and&#13;
  offers lessons for those interested in setting up such programs in future.&#13;

Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Programs to promote handwashing with soap could be amongst the most effective and cost-&#13;
effective interventions for reducing infectious diseases in the world today. A million lives could&#13;
be saved each year, if hands were washed systematically with soap.&#13;
&#13;
Whilst public agencies are interested in saving lives, private industry is more interested in&#13;
selling soap. This is the founding rationale for a public-private partnership to promote&#13;
handwashing with soap. However, partnership can bring other benefits; industry enhances its&#13;
image and knowledge whilst the public sector benefits from state-of-the-art communication skills&#13;
of private industry.&#13;
&#13;
After 18 months of work, two programs are ready for launch in the state of Kerala, India and in&#13;
Ghana. Building up the partnerships was a slow and resource-intensive process. Success will&#13;
ultimately be judged by carefully measuring the impact of the programs. In the meantime, four&#13;
factors argue for the pursuit of the Public Private Partnership, both in the two trial countries and&#13;
in expanding the initiative to a limited number of other countries:&#13;
&#13;
· The handwash programs that have been designed are groundbreaking.&#13;
· Many enquiries on joining the initiative have come from Governments, NGOs and external&#13;
  support agencies.&#13;
· Three major global industrial players are in discussions on expanding the initiative.&#13;
· International interest in handwashing as an intervention has grown in the past two years,&#13;
  increasing the need for well-documented trials of new approaches.&#13;
&#13;
Many private and public agencies are interested in setting up Public Private Partnerships for&#13;
Handwashing in their own countries. This document is primarily for them. It is also for decision&#13;
makers in Industry, Government and external support agencies, who need to know if investing&#13;
in such activities is likely to be worthwhile or not.&#13;
&#13;
Part 1 of this document explores the rationale for handwashing programs and for Public Private&#13;
Partnerships; Part 2 outlines the history of the initiative; Part 3 documents the approach; and&#13;
Part 4 covers insights about handwashing gleaned from consumer research and the implications&#13;
of the findings for the handwash programs. Part 5 provides conclusions and key lessons.&#13;
&#13;
This document covers the lessons learnt about setting up Public Private Partnerships for&#13;
Handwashing. A second document will cover operationalizing and monitoring. All program&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
   The Public Private Partnership for Handwashing: an idea whose time has come?&#13;
   s Handwashing with soap could save a million lives.&#13;
&#13;
   s Diarrhoeal diseases are losing ground to other health issues on the international agenda:&#13;
     new programs to promote handwashing provide a rallying point.&#13;
   s Combining the forces of the public and the private sector to promote handwashing with&#13;
     soap offers rewards to both.&#13;
&#13;
   However, it needs time and effort...&#13;
   s Few individuals and agencies appreciate the importance of handwashing; advocacy is&#13;
     needed at all levels.&#13;
   s Building partnerships is time-consuming and resource intensive. It needs complementary&#13;
     skills and champions with drive and energy.&#13;
   s People at the top of key institutions provide the necessary leadership.&#13;
&#13;
   s Industry players may be reluctant to work together, but they increasingly see that it makes&#13;
     sense to increase the market for all. To come on board, small-scale players may need extra&#13;
     assistance.&#13;
   s Partnership arrangements should be flexible and open to all who wish to join.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   ...and insight, understanding and particular skills&#13;
   s Industry is well placed to design communications programs; they have made huge investments&#13;
     in developing their own expertise in consumer insight, message design and media planning.&#13;
   s Consumer studies into handwashing should be carried out by professional market/consumer&#13;
     research agencies with Industry assistance.&#13;
   s Communication strategies require detailed trial and testing for effectiveness, otherwise the&#13;
     investment may be wasted.&#13;
   s Changing behavior patterns is not easy. According to industry, adopting a new practice&#13;
     needs at least six effective contacts a month. Drip-drip approaches do not provide a critical&#13;
     mass of stimulus for habits to change.&#13;
   s A champion from each organization at each level is essential. A trusted catalyst that can&#13;
     bring together industry, government and support agencies is also needed.&#13;
&#13;
   But much remains to be learnt&#13;
   s Work is needed to validate indicators of handwashing behavior for baseline monitoring and&#13;
     evaluation. Trying to monitor the impact of the program on diarrhoeal diseases is a more&#13;
     difficult task.&#13;
   s External support agencies, government and industry have different expectations and time&#13;
     horizons; figuring out how to satisfy the needs of all partners while retaining innovative&#13;
     programming is a challenge.&#13;
   s Further challenges include how to make partnerships deliver new handwash products, and&#13;
     making handwashing cheaper for the poorest, possibly via tax incentives.&#13;
&#13;
   Finally&#13;
   s The initiative cannot be evaluated until it has produced results, but the prospects look good&#13;
     for the continuation and expansion of the Public Private Partnership for Handwashing.&#13;

Handwash: A Brief History&#13;
&#13;
"A growing number of business leaders share unease about any form of global economic&#13;
development that fails to emphasize the human dimension or that creates a globalization of&#13;
opportunity without a corresponding globalization of responsibility"  1&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Water and Sanitation decade of the 1980s     into hygiene behavior and the BASICS&#13;
saw    substantial     improvements      in the  experience. This inspired the idea of trying to&#13;

diseases remained amongst the top three killers  were held between WB/WSP and LSHTM, and&#13;
of children. The realization began to grow that  management consultants McKinsey and Co&#13;
the way in which facilities were used might be   were consulted. They considered the&#13;
just as important as their provision. Growing    proposition sound, but pointed out the need&#13;
interest in hygiene behavior in the 1990s gave   for strong leadership and careful planning.&#13;
researchers insight into the context and meaning&#13;
of hygiene behavior2 and led to the              The concept was further developed, and in&#13;
development      of    approaches      such   as the year 2000, two sites willing and able to&#13;
Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation             trial the idea were located in Ghana and the&#13;
Transformation (PHAST) and the social            state of Kerala, India. The objective was to try&#13;
marketing of hygiene    3, 4.                    to get private industry and the public sector to&#13;

However, approaches that could be scaled up      handwashing. We wanted to learn how to set&#13;
to meet the need for improvement in hygiene      up such programs, and to explore their&#13;
on a mass scale, similar to vaccination          feasibility, acceptability and value. A contract&#13;
programs, were still needed. Consumer studies    for technical assistance from the LSHTM for the&#13;

&#13;
  Observed handwashing practices in Ghana and Kerala&#13;
  The results of the studies proved controversial and highlighted the need for an agreed&#13;
  methodology, acceptable to all, for measuring handwashing. Closer examination of the&#13;
  methodology adopted in both locations suggests that many non-handwashing events were&#13;
  missed, for example, when defecation took place away from the house. Structured observation&#13;
  requires careful introduction so as not to bias results and much patience and supervision.&#13;
  Some of these safeguards may have failed in either or both studies. Alternatively, handwashing&#13;
  with soap after contact with excreta may actually be higher than was predicted. More careful&#13;
  measures of handwashing to provide a reliable baseline are needed, otherwise changes over&#13;
  the time of the intervention cannot be measured accurately.&#13;
&#13;
  Handwashing at key times other than after defecation and cleaning up a child is poor and&#13;
  these occasions could also be the focus of attempts to improve handwashing. A weighted&#13;
  average of handwashing with soap in Kerala at different critical times suggested that soap&#13;
  was only used on about 14 percent of these occasions.&#13;
&#13;
  In Kerala, hands were washed with soap more often when water was available in the toilet or&#13;
  when soap was available in the toilet. In better-off households separate soaps were kept for&#13;
  separate purposes (bathing, cleaning clothes, for menstrual stains) and all households used&#13;
  special soap, (e.g. Johnsons' baby soap), for a new baby. Soaps claimed to be used for&#13;
  handwashing were all beauty soaps, not laundry soaps. Commonest brands mentioned were:&#13;
  Lexus Gold, Nima Rose, Lux and Santoor. The monthly amount claimed to be spent on soap&#13;
  did not vary much between social classes. In over half of households, the father purchased&#13;
  soap, but mothers chose the brand. One hundred percent of households had soap on the day&#13;
  of the interview.&#13;
&#13;
  The Kerala results showed that those who did not use soap to wash their hands after using the&#13;
  toilet reported diarrhoea five times more often than those who did.&#13;
&#13;
  Both studies concluded that poor disposal of children's stools (often thrown in the yard, on an&#13;
  open rubbish heap, in a field or drain) could be a source of the faecal pathogens that cause&#13;
  child diarrhoea. One option may be to add this issue to the program at a later date, once the&#13;
  handwashing message is well established.&#13;

   The preliminary results from the studies suggest                   program to the midday meals program in&#13;
   that handwashing is a complex practice that                        primary schools. Mass media and direct&#13;
   is carried out for a number of reasons. These                      contact together have additive and synergistic&#13;
   reasons can by physical (`I see/feel/smell dirt                    effects. Media will be generic with no company&#13;
   on my hands') and metaphysical (`I feel                            logos. Interestingly, industry is keen not to be&#13;
   unclean/ polluted/ disgusted/ dirty').                             seen to be associated with the handwash&#13;
   Cleaning hands with soap serves to refresh,                        initiative because they expect Government&#13;

                                             Key Lessons&#13;
&#13;
  s  Handwashing behavior is complex&#13;
&#13;
  s  Measuring handwashing behavior is difficult&#13;
&#13;
  s  Formative research study designs should be further simplified to provide a clearer focus,&#13;
     and training and supervision require substantial international inputs.&#13;
&#13;
  s  Keys to behavior change are likely to be i) making people feel that they have something&#13;
     on their hands after defecation; ii) making it easier to wash hands by having soap to&#13;
     hand; iii) targeting life change events.&#13;
&#13;
  s  The study results need further detailed analysis, both for the insights they offer into the&#13;
     design of each program and to increase the knowledge base about handwashing.&#13;
&#13;
  s  To generate a behavior change, industry specialists believe that effective contact with the&#13;
     message in the mass media has to be made at least six times a month. Drip-drip strategies&#13;
     do not provide the critical mass of stimulus needed to change habits.&#13;
&#13;
  s  Communications programs will be non-branded and use both mass media and direct contact.&#13;
&#13;
  s  Industry involvement at the design and execution stage of the studies would have added to&#13;
     their value.&#13;

Future Challenges, Conclusions                                                                               Part 5&#13;

Future challenges                                     will, at least, benefit from this exercise. As Tom&#13;

One year on, the idea of the Public Private           Clasen points out14, multiple partnerships can be&#13;

Partnership for handwashing is well and truly         difficult and complex and there are many&#13;
&#13;
launched. However, as we move towards                 precedents for engaging with single companies&#13;
&#13;
replication in other countries, challenges remain:    in public-private partnerships. Single partnerships&#13;
                                                      might prove the most effective use of public&#13;

                                                      of transparency and openness to all partners&#13;

for small players. In Ghana, there are three          expenditure. In Kerala, the program will pay for&#13;
industrial partners, two large and one small-scale,   itself after two years; in Ghana likely savings&#13;
and individual companies and industry                 amount to twice the estimated program costs.&#13;
associations form part of the steering committee,     Donor agencies may find the idea of spending&#13;
though Unilever still plays the biggest role. It      many millions on handwashing surprising, and&#13;

   is difficult, and compromise on the large-scale&#13;
   objectives may not be advisable, if the program      Research needs&#13;
   is to produce measurable results. A further cost     Hygiene and handwashing are poorly&#13;
   issue is the contribution that can be expected from  researched. More and better quality data is&#13;

   that they profit from increased sales of soap,       diarrhoeal diseases, respiratory tract and skin&#13;
