A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.  The massive movements of population, and the concentration of people in those parts of Bosnia and&#13;
Herzegovina (BH) considered safer than others, have resulted in major problems in the delivery of basic&#13;
water, sanitation and solid waste services to the population. Water supplies in many urban centers are&#13;
grossly inadequate for the number of people requiring services, leaving many people suffering from&#13;
serious privation. Waterborne diseases are becoming increasingly common, water service is intermittent&#13;
and water contamination from insufficiently treated wastewater remains a constant hazard. Furthermnore,&#13;
arrangements for the disposal of solid waste have almost collapsed, bringing new health hazards to&#13;
citizens.&#13;
2.  Bosnia and Herzegovina (the State, comprising the Bosniac-Croat Federation and the Republic of&#13;
Srpska) estimates the total sector requirements for restoration of service to prewar levels and upgrading&#13;
to meet changed conditions at $950 million. Taking into consideration the implementation capacity of&#13;
the existing institutions, the Bank has proposed a 3-year US$380 million program that would be&#13;
implemented with three separately financed projects. The proposed Project would be the first one in the&#13;
program. It comprises equipment supply, urgent works, strategic planning, institutional strengthening&#13;
and preparation of the next project at an estimated cost of $70 million and would target needs in the&#13;
Federation. The second and third projects would address needs in both the Federation and the Republic&#13;
of Srpska.&#13;
Sector Organization&#13;
3.  Federal Level. The responsible Ministry is the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and&#13;
Forestry (MAWRF). The MAWRF sets policies and standards and recommends legislation for all water&#13;
management functions. Implementation of the policy and legislation is the responsibility of Vodoprivreda&#13;
BH (VBH). This is the organization that is responsible for the rehabilitation of the sector and would&#13;
manage the proposed Project. VBH's headquarters are in Sarajevo. At present, there is only one&#13;
regional office which is located in Mostar. VBH has plans to establish two more regional offices in Tuzla&#13;
and Bihac.&#13;
4.  Municipal Level. Municipalities have primary responsibility for the provision of water supply,&#13;
sanitation and solid waste services in BH. They provide these services through komunalcos (municipal&#13;
service companies) that function like municipally owned joint stock companies. Tariffs must be approved&#13;
by the municipalities served, but finances are kept separate from municipal revenues. In the past project&#13;
proposals for investments generally were initiated by the komunalcos. If the projects were local and did&#13;
not require federal funding, they were planned and implemented by the komunalcos If they were&#13;
regional, they were implemented by VBH.&#13;
Sector Issues and Policies&#13;
5.  Water Supply. The quality of water supply service in BH has deteriorated sharply since 1991.&#13;
Whereas in the past, piped municipal water supply coverage in most urban areas was good (90% of&#13;
population served) and 24 hour service was the norm, now in many areas service is intermittent and water&#13;
quality has deteriorated. The main reasons for the deterioration of service have been: (i) increased&#13;
demand from the influx of refugees; (ii) existing water sources having been made inaccessible as a result&#13;
of the war; (iii) waste by consumers when water is available because meters are no longer read and bills&#13;
are no longer collected; (iv) excessive water leakages in transmission and distribution networks as a result&#13;
of lack of maintenance during the war; and (v) direct damage resulting from the war. The lack of&#13;
maintenance, the primary cause of today's problems, resulted from constraints on labor and capital during&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 2&#13;
the hostilities as well as the widespread practice of charging very little for water, so that funds were&#13;
generally not available for maintenance. Also, many technicians left, leaving water and sewerage works&#13;
organizations undermanned. For example, the Sarajevo Water and Sewerage Works is currently operating&#13;
with only one-third of their pre-war staff. While coverage in the pre-war period was good in urban areas,&#13;
most rural areas still relied on dug wells or vender supplied water. Piped water supply coverage in rural&#13;
areas is only 56% of the population. Thus, a timebound program to introduce water charges, taking into&#13;
account peoples' capacity to pay, seems to be an essential precondition for any major investments beyond&#13;
the initial "firefighting" effort.&#13;
6.  Sewerage. Prior to 1991, BH had made significant progress in developing water borne sewage&#13;
collection and treatment systems. Collection system coverage in urban areas averaged 70% as compared&#13;
to 90% for water supply. Less than 10% of the rural population was connected to a water borne&#13;
sewerage system. Most of the population relied on septic tanks which were satisfactory. Secondary&#13;
treatment of wastewater in modern treatment plants was the exception. The largest and most important&#13;
wastewater treatment plant is in Sarajevo, but few other towns have made investments beyond screening&#13;
and grit removal. As is the case for water distribution, lack of maintenance has also been a problem.&#13;
Leaky sewer systems with collectors dating back to 1920 create the potential for contamination of the&#13;
water system and nearby aquifers. This lack of maintenance and in some places war damage have&#13;
contributed to sewer pipe blockages, sewer pipe breaks, pumping station failures and treatment plant&#13;
shutdowns. In Vitez, Novi Travnik and Gornji Vakuf, the sewerage systems are in such poor condition&#13;
that reconstruction of the system is the only economic alternative. Geologically, the South-Western&#13;
region of BH with its sensitive "karst" area relies heavily on the use of groundwater for water supply,&#13;
calling for special efforts to avoid contamination of groundwater aquifers. Rivers used for water supply&#13;
are also being polluted from untreated discharges of municipal and industrial wastewater, but this is not&#13;
a new condition resulting from the war. Rivers most affected are the Sava, Bosnia, Litvia, Lasva and&#13;
Vrbas. There is much to be done towards improving wastewater collection and treatment. In the&#13;
proposed Project, priority would be given to the repair and rehabilitation of the collection systems.&#13;
7.  Solid Waste. Prior to 1991, most municipalities had fairly well organized waste collection services,&#13;
ensuring delivery of solid wastes to landfill sites or temporary disposal areas although few of the sites&#13;
were properly designed. Service has collapsed in many urban areas because most garbage trucks were&#13;
either destroyed or became inoperable during the war due to lack of maintenance and availability of spare&#13;
parts. Municipalities that had joint disposal sites before the war, today in some cases, refuse to share&#13;
facilities and many divided municipalities have lost access to garbage trucks and containers to handle their&#13;
refuse. In many urban areas, restoration of dependable solid waste collection service is as critical as&#13;
improving water supply services.&#13;
Bank Pre-war Involvement in the Sector&#13;
8.  The Bank made 28 loans to BH as a former Republic of Yugoslavia, two of which included water&#13;
and sanitation components. They were: (i) Ln 1263 Sarajevo Water and Wastewater Project; and (ii)&#13;
Ln 2233 Tuzla Region Water and Environmental Project. The two loans totalled $51 million. The&#13;
Sarajevo project comprised rehabilitation and expansion of the water distribution networks and the&#13;
construction of a wastewater treatment plant (This plant was damaged during the war and requires&#13;
extensive repairs to be placed in operation). The Tuzla project increased production capacity and&#13;
provided for a major interceptor to convey wastewater to the site of a proposed wastewater treatment&#13;
plant. The wastewater treatment plant, also included in the project, was not built because of a shortage&#13;
of counter-part funds. Components that were completed in each project were well executed. In 1990,&#13;
BH while still a part of Yugoslavia, opened discussions with the Bank about possible financing of several&#13;
regional water supply systems. These discussions were suspended with the breakup of Yugoslavia in&#13;
1991.&#13;

Sector Recovery Program&#13;
9.  The sector recovery program for BH is based on planning carried out by the Federation, the&#13;
Republic of Srpska, the International Management Group (IMG) and the World Health Organization&#13;
(WHO). The IMG was established in 1993 by the European Union to provide technical assistance to the&#13;
Federation and the Republic of Srpska for the restoration of war damaged infrastructure. The Federation's&#13;
planning is based mostly on requests for assistance received from municipalities and local sector operating&#13;
organizations. IMG and the WHO have carried out a limited number of pre-feasibility studies for water&#13;
supply rehabilitation projects in Federation municipalities and have carried out inventories of needs in the&#13;
Republic of Srpska. The program is designed to be implemented in three years through three phased&#13;
country-wide projects. The first project would comprise urgent works, the second project rehabilitation&#13;
works, and the third project system upgrading works.&#13;
10. The objectives of the program are: (i) to meet the immediate needs of the affected population; (ii)&#13;
to return water management facilities to pre-war conditions; (iii) to make selected improvements that are&#13;
of high priority; and (iv) to help establish the institutions needed to sustain the sector over the long term.&#13;
The cost of the program is estimated at $380 million (which works out at approximately $115 per capita&#13;
for the population of 3.3 million in the BH).  The implementation period is three years. A cost&#13;
breakdown is in Table 1.&#13;

11.    Under the first project, top priority would be given to urgent works ($60 million)'. The proposed&#13;
works would deal with the most serious and urgent needs of the population which can be met quickly&#13;
(i.e., replacement of tools, equipment and repair materials lost or expended since 1991 by local operating&#13;
organization, works which do not require a major lead time for the final design or supply of equipment).&#13;
For water supply ($38 million), the Project would provide maintenance equipment to local water works&#13;
and make critical on-site repairs of broken water distribution pipes and temporary repairs to water&#13;
I  Does not include US$10.0 million in engineering, planning and recurrent costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;

treatment plants and pumping stations to ensure that clean water is delivered to consumers. For sanitation&#13;
($13 million), the urgent works would cover the provision of equipment for unblocking sewer pipes and&#13;
the replacement of critical sections of collectors in places where the most serious health hazards have been&#13;
identified. For solid waste ($9 million), the works would cover the supply of trucks and equipment as&#13;
well as the development of some landfills where needs are identified as critical and major health risks are&#13;
assessed.&#13;
12.   Following the startup of the first project, rehabilitation works requiring a longer lead time and&#13;
more careful preparation would be phased in through a second project ($145 million). For water supply&#13;
($66 million), the works would involve repairs to pumping stations, replacement of water mains,&#13;
installation of valves and control structures, and setting up stocks of spare parts. For sanitation ($44&#13;
million), almost 60% of the required works would be for Sarajevo ($30 million) where a major effort to&#13;
restore the sewerage network to its pre-war condition would be implemented through jetting to remove&#13;
blockages, network reconstruction, replacement of pumping equipment and repair of the Sarajevo waste&#13;
water treatment plant. The Trnovo waste water treatment plant upstream of Sarajevo would also be&#13;
repaired ($8 million). The operation of this plant is important because Trnovo is upstream of Sarajevo&#13;
and its sewage if not treated could endanger the quality of Sarajevo's drinking water supply. For solid&#13;
waste disposal ($17 million), major landfills would be improved and garbage trucks distributed to the&#13;
larger municipalities. For irrigation ($3 million), damaged systems serving consumers that are prepared&#13;
to use the water most effectively would be rehabilitated. Finally, for flood control and drainage ($15&#13;
million) systems where human life is most at risk would be rehabilitated.&#13;
13.   The third project would comprise system upgrading works ($122 million) which would be&#13;
introduced in areas where systems are operational but in serious need of upgrading either because their&#13;
economic life is coming to an end or because outdated technology is causing unacceptably high operating&#13;
costs or inadequate performance. In the water supply sector ($86 million), piped water supply would be&#13;
extended to unserved populations, water production and treatment facilities would be expanded, water&#13;
distribution networks would be reinforced and administrative buildings would be upgraded. For&#13;
sanitation ($10 million), primary treatment plants would be constructed where health and environmental&#13;
benefits are clearly identifiable. For solid waste ($8 million), the Project would extend the rehabilitation&#13;
project actions in land fills and equipment to further locations. For flood control and drainage ($10&#13;
million) the level of protection of existing systems where the benefits exceed the cost by a wide margin,&#13;
would be increased. For irrigation ($8 million) the project would continue the work started under the&#13;
Rehabilitation Project.&#13;
14.   In addition to the investments described above, it would be necessary to provide funds in all three&#13;
projects for recurrent costs of the local operating organizations and to help establish and build up sector&#13;
institutions at the level of the republic and the regions. This would support the new structure of the&#13;
country emerging from the peace negotiations. Clearly significant amounts of equipment (vehicles, office&#13;
equipment, computers, etc.) will be needed to support this investment effort and the future management&#13;
and development of the sector. The estimated cost of these activities and needs over the three year period&#13;
is $30 million. This amount would also permit studies in water management of key river basins to be&#13;
conducted as well as some basic work on water strategy planning. Such studies have been identified by&#13;
government engineers as sorely lacking and necessary to establish the coherence of the water management&#13;
effort. The cost of these studies within the $30 million allowance is estimated to be $4 million. In&#13;
addition an allocation of $23 million to cover the costs of project management, engineering and technical&#13;
assistance has been included. Out of the $53 million, $10 million would be spent under the first project,&#13;
$25 million under the second project and $17 million under the third project.&#13;

C. THE PROJECT&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
15.   The deterioration of the water, sanitation and solid waste infrastructure as a result of the war has&#13;
been described above. Full recovery to pre-war conditions will take time. However, there are some&#13;
actions that can improve service quickly and remove risks to public health. Also, actions must be taken&#13;
now to prepare for those works that will take more time to implement and to start making the institutional&#13;
changes that will result in long term sustainability of the sector. These are the objectives of this Project.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
16.    To meet these objectives, the Project would comprise five parts. (i) the supply of equipment and&#13;
materials; (ii) urgent works for the provision of water supply sanitation and solid waste services in&#13;
municipalities; (iii) emergency sector planning; (iv) institutional strengthening through the provision of&#13;
technical assistance, training and recurrent cost financing; and (v) the preparation rehabilitation and&#13;
upgrading type projects for implementation under a second project. Each part of the Project is described&#13;
in detail as follows:&#13;
17.    Part A. Supply of Eguipment and Materials (US$ 15 million equivalent). During the war, much&#13;
rolling stock and construction equipment used for maintenance and repair was either destroyed, stolen&#13;
or stopped working for lack of spare parts. Also, pipes, fittings, repair materials and small tools&#13;
maintained in reserve for emergency repairs were either destroyed or used up without replacement. Since&#13;
the war's end, many utilities have identified urgent repair works that could be carried out with their own&#13;
maintenance personnel if they had the materials. This component would be aimed at meeting all these&#13;
needs. The needs of operating organizations serving about 40 municipalities would be met under this&#13;
component. Equipment and materials under this component would only be provided to municipalities that&#13;
have demonstrated that they have sufficient resources to use them without additional financial assistance.&#13;
A list of the first 12 municipalities selected to be assisted under this part of the Project and their needs&#13;
is in Appendix 2.&#13;
18.    Part B. Urgent Works for the Provision of Water Supply, Sanitation and Solid Waste Services&#13;
for Municipalities (US$47 million equivalent). Many of the water supply and sewerage systems in Bosnia&#13;
suffered both direct damage from shelling or indirect damage from lack of maintenance. Also, shifts in&#13;
population have resulted in increased demands being put on some systems while others have seen a&#13;
decrease in demand. The situation in Sarajevo is typical of that found in many other smaller cities.&#13;
Water service is intermittent with some areas of the city only receiving water for an hour or so every&#13;
other day. Because of the low system pressures, the upper floors of some apartment buildings receive&#13;
no water at all. Also, when consumers have water pressure, their is no incentive to conserve it because&#13;
meters are either broken or not read. As a result of all these deficiencies, system losses exceed 50% of&#13;
production. The sewage collection system also suffers from neglect. Back-ups into buildings and the&#13;
flooding of streets with sewage are common occurrences. This component would comprise repair and&#13;
rehabilitation type works (including goods, consultants' services and commercial services) aimed at&#13;
reducing these problems in Sarajevo, Zenica, Tuzla, Travnik, Bihac and 15 other priority municipalities.&#13;
Typical works to be undertaken in all the municipalities are as follows:&#13;
*      Rehabilitation of well field and pumping stations to restore capacity&#13;
*      Rehabilitation of booster pumping stations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

*     Investigation and repair and/or replacement of leaking pipes and appurtenances in the water&#13;
distribution network&#13;
*     Investigation and replacement of leaking service connections&#13;
*     Testing, repair and/or replacement of customer water meters&#13;
*     Cleaning of the sewage collection system&#13;
*     Replacement of damage sewer pipes&#13;
19.   A list of the municipalities from which the 20 municipalities comprising Part B of the Project&#13;
would be selected is in Appendix 3.&#13;
20.   Part C. Emergencv Development Plan for the Water Management Sector (US$0.6 million&#13;
equivalent). The planning done to date for the reconstruction of the water management sector by IMG&#13;
and the WHO is only partially complete. Also, these plans have been prepared in isolation so that it is&#13;
difficult to determine priorities. The emergency development plan would inventory every water and&#13;
sewerage and solid waste system serving the Federation's 70 municipalities, assess needs and recommend&#13;
solutions to overcome existing problems. Alternative solutions would be evaluated. The final result&#13;
would be a prioritized list of interventions integrated into an overall plan for all 70 municipaliLies.&#13;
Emergency planning for Sarajevo and Mostar has already been completed; therefore, they are not&#13;
included in the proposed study; however, their projects would be integrated into the final project priority&#13;
list resulting from the plan.&#13;
21.   Part D. Institutional Strengthening (US$2.0 million equivalent). This component would have&#13;
two parts. The first part would comprise training. At the Federation level, the training would focus on&#13;
strategic planning, sector organization and project management. An important aspect of the training&#13;
would focus on private sector involvement for the provision of municipal water, sanitation and solid waste&#13;
services, starting with solid waste collection.  Training in the financial control of projects and&#13;
bookkeeping for the financial staff would be an important part of the project management training. At&#13;
the municipal level, the focus would be on project management, financial management, maintenance&#13;
management, computer skills and the reduction of unaccounted-for water. Twinning arrangements with&#13;
water and sewerage works organizations in donor countries would be used to the maximum extent&#13;
possible. The second part of the Project would provide financing of incremental operating costs for VBH&#13;
and the municipalities to implement and start up the Project.&#13;
22.   Part E. Preparation of the Water, Sanitation and Solid Waste Rehabilitation Project (US$5.0&#13;
million equivalent). The scope of work would comprise final designs, procurement documentation and&#13;
the contracting of works scheduled for implementation under the second project. The works would be&#13;
identified in the Emergency Plan.&#13;
Project Cost and Financing Plan&#13;
23.   Proiect Cost. The total cost of the Project not including customs duties and taxes equals US$70.0&#13;
million equivalent. Duties and taxes could add another US$2.0 million. No physical or price&#13;
contingencies have been included given the nature the Project which can be modified to meet the funds&#13;
available. Project costs are given in Table 2. below.&#13;

24.    Financing Plan. The financing plan for the Project is in Table 3. The European Commission&#13;
(EC) has made available US$ 14.7 million equivalent in parallel grant financing that will be released in&#13;
two tranches. The first tranche is for US$ 9.8 million. The EC will manage the use of their funds and&#13;
the procurement undertaken with them in coordination with the Bank. The Netherlands Government has&#13;
committed $2.0 million equivalent in trust funds and direct aid for the Bank to administer in grant form,&#13;
and the Austrian Government has committed US$3.0 million for Part E of the Project. Of the total cost,&#13;
the Bank wouid finance US$ 20.0 million on IDA terms. Other donors that have expressed interest in&#13;
providing the remaining $30.3 million are the Council of Europe Social Development Fund and the&#13;
Government of Japan. The benefitting municipalities would be responsible for paying duties and taxes.&#13;
If the financing gap of $30.3 million is not met, the scope of Part B of the Project would be reduced from&#13;
20 municipalities to 8 and the number of projects to be prepared for the next project would reduced.&#13;
Because the Project is comprised of about 65 sub-projects in 50 different municipalities, each designed&#13;
as an independent project, the Project can be safely be expanded or reduced to meet the available&#13;
financing.&#13;

25.   Onlending Arrangements. The State would be the Borrower and would onlend the proceeds of&#13;
the Bank Credit to the Federation. The Federation, through VBH as its agent, would use the proceeds&#13;
of the Bank Credit to provide credits to the benefitting municipalities under Part A, B and D of the&#13;
Project. During negotiations, it was agreed that the onlending terms would be 30 years maturity at zero&#13;
interest including 7 years grace. The credit agreements between the Federation and each municipality&#13;
would provide for a percentage of the amounts received to be forgiven. The percentage would be&#13;
determined as soon as the repayment conditions of all financing for the project is known. It would be&#13;
calculated by dividing the amount of grant financing in the financing plan by the total cost of the Project.&#13;
It is estimate that about 60% of each municipal credit could be forgiven. The cost of Parts C and E of&#13;
the Project would be paid by the Federation.&#13;
26.   Cost Recovery. Most water and sewerage works in the Federation have been unable to collect&#13;
for their services during the conflict. It would be difficult to reinstate charges in the short term, and it&#13;
is unlikely that any municipality would be able to contribute to the cost of the Project from any other&#13;
source except in kind. However, there should be some commitment by the benefitting municipalities to&#13;
obtain cost recovery in the future so that they can repay the credits. During negotiations, it was agreed&#13;
that each benefitting municipality would submit an Action Plan for increasing the revenues for water,&#13;
sanitation and solid waste collection services to a level that would permit recovery of operating costs in&#13;
two years and all costs, including depreciation, in seven years. It was further agreed that the submission&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 10&#13;
of the Action Plans would be a condition of effectiveness of the credit agreements between Federation&#13;
and each benefitting municipality.&#13;
Financial and Economic Justification&#13;
27.   The Project is primarily focussed on rehabilitation work, which has in general economic rates of&#13;
return in excess of 30 percent. These returns result from reduction in the large amounts of unaccounted&#13;
for water (estimated to be greater than 50 percent) and the related declines in usage of electricity and&#13;
chemicals. Moreover, the crucial rehabilitation effort at this juncture on severely deteriorated works will&#13;
save millions of dollars in investments that, in the absence of the Project, would have to be made to&#13;
totally or in large part replace systems for both water and wastewater.&#13;
28.   To ensure that only the most economically viable projects are undertaken, assurances were&#13;
obtained during negotiations that all municipal project components would be selected based on an assigned&#13;
priority. Criteria for assigning priorities, which would be applied sequentially, are as follows:&#13;
(i)    Deficiency in water quantity;&#13;
(ii)    Deficiency in water quality which constitutes a severe threat to public health;&#13;
(iii)   Large number of beneficiaries;&#13;
(iv)   Deficiency in water supply, sanitation or solid waste disposal which constitutes a&#13;
constraint to economic development; and&#13;
(v)    The proposed project includes cost-effective interconnection of systems.&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
29.   The Project would have positive environmental impacts as a result of reduction in water losses,&#13;
a safer water supply, improved sewage collection and proper disposal of solid waste.  There is no&#13;
resettlement involved. In addition, all work would be monitored during supervision to ensure that there&#13;
is no degradation to the environment. In project components that include the extension or improvement&#13;
of sewage collection systems, special care will be taken to mitigate the effects of concentrating sewage&#13;
discharges so that surface water and ground water sources of public water supply are not endangered.&#13;
The Project has no significant negative environmental impact and has been placed in environmental&#13;
screening category "B".&#13;
D. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Project Organization&#13;
30.   The responsible Government Ministry is the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Resources and&#13;
Forestry (MAWRF). MAWRF would have general oversight for the Project and set policy. VBH would&#13;
have overall responsibility for implementing the Project. Organizational changes and staffing of VBH&#13;
would be approved by MAWRF. Regarding the Project, MAWRF would approve recipients of the&#13;
financial assistance under Parts A, B and D of the Project and deal with any other related matters. The&#13;
MAWRF would also be responsible for negotiating the conditions of other potential donors. Decisions&#13;
about implementation of the Project would be left to VBH as the agent of the Federation.&#13;
31.   A special Projects Development Department has been established in VBH with the responsibility&#13;
of managing all reconstruction projects. The Projects Development Department Director would have&#13;
overall charge of the Project. Reporting to the Director would be two division heads--one for engineering&#13;
and one for research and development. The VBH Legislative Management Division would advise on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page I 1&#13;
legal matters and review contracts.  The Investments Department would be responsible for all&#13;
procurement and the Finance and Administration Department would oversee the financial management&#13;
of the Project. The VBH regional offices would be responsible for overseeing the implementation of the&#13;
Project in their respective areas. For purposes of the Project, the head of each VBH regional office&#13;
would report to the Project Development Department Director. VBH would be responsible for approving&#13;
all equipment requests from the municipalities benefitting from Part A of the Project and passing these&#13;
requests on to the EC project office in Sarajevo to procure and deliver. VBH would carry out the&#13;
procurement for its own equipment under Part A of the Project and all works and consulting services&#13;
under Part B of the Project. The municipalities would be responsible for supervising the contracts after&#13;
they are signed.&#13;
32.   As a result of the war, many managers and engineers have left VBH; and there is a shortage of&#13;
qualified personnel required for the task of managing the reconstruction program so that VBH needs&#13;
strengthening. To assist with the rebuilding and strengthening, VBH would hire five foreign advisors&#13;
on a full-time basis and short-term experts on an as needed basis under Part D of the Project. An&#13;
internationally experienced water operating company would be contracted to provide for the short-term&#13;
experts. Most of the assistance would be for advice in the area of project design and procurement.&#13;
33.   The Federation would like to encourage the development of the local construction and consulting&#13;
industry by seeing as much of the engineering and construction work contracted to local firms. The local&#13;
consulting firms are for the most part firms comprising individuals who used to work for the design&#13;
institutes that did most of the engineering work in former Yugoslavia. Individuals and small firms from&#13;
Croatia and Slovenia are also expected to be competitive and win contracts for some of the engineering&#13;
consulting assignments. Local contractors and contractors from Croatia and Slovenia would have good&#13;
prospects of winning a large percentage of the works contracts because of their local knowledge and the&#13;
fact that most of the bid packages would be too small to interest foreign contractors. The local&#13;
contractors would comprise recently formed firms founded by local entrepreneurs who use to work for&#13;
the large construction institutes that did most of the work in former Yugoslavia. Many of these new&#13;
groups are supported technically and financially by foreign construction companies.&#13;
34.   A project organization chart for the Project is in Appendix 4.&#13;
Project Implementation&#13;
35.   The equipment and materials to be supplied to the municipalities selected under Part A of the&#13;
Project, Supply of Equipment and Materials, would be procured by the VBH Procurement Division. To&#13;
benefit from this part of the Project, the municipalities would be required to make a formal request to&#13;
VBH (this has been done), to sign a credit agreement with the Federation and to confirm receipt of the&#13;
goods when they arrive.&#13;
36.   The municipalities selected for assistance under Part B, Urgent Works for Municipalities, would&#13;
follow the same procedures as in Part A. VBH would contract and provide general oversight of the&#13;
works, and the municipalities manage implementation of the contracts. Small works with an aggregate&#13;
value of about US$2.0 million would be carried out with the municipality's own staff and day laborers&#13;
under force account. However, most work would be performed under contract. The VBH regional&#13;
offices would verify the works and approve payments. The funds would be disbursed from the VBH&#13;
main office in Sarajevo. Contractors under the supervision of the municipality komunalcos would&#13;
implement the larger works. The VBH Sarajevo office would contract the large works. The regional&#13;
offices would contract the small works. For force account work, agreements specifying the scope of&#13;
work and the terms for reimbursement would be entered into between VBH and the executing&#13;
municipality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 12&#13;
37.   A typical project selected for implementation under a works contract would be implemented in&#13;
the following manner. The VBH regional office in consultation with the municipality would define the&#13;
scope of the project. The VBH regional office would then contract a consultant (a local consultant if&#13;
qualified) to prepare designs and bidding documents under their direction but in consultation with the&#13;
municipality. When the documents have been approved by the municipality, the VBH regional office&#13;
would carry out the bidding and the bid evaluation. However, the municipality would have an&#13;
opportunity to comment on the results of the evaluation before the award is made. The VBH regional&#13;
office would negotiate and sign the final contract and approve payments to the contractor. The&#13;
municipality through its komunalco would supervise its execution.&#13;
38.   Project Implementation Schedule. Implementation of Parts A and C of the Project, provision of&#13;
equipment and preparation of the National Emergency Plan, are already in progress. Orders have been&#13;
placed for computers, office equipment and vehicles to reestablish VBH. Their headquarters were&#13;
completely destroyed during the war. Other parts of the Project are still undergoing preparation. All&#13;
project funds should be committed in 1996. The Project is expected to take two years to implement. The&#13;
project completion date is June 30, 1998. The proposed credit closing date is June 30 1999. A project&#13;
implementation plan and schedule is in Appendix 5.&#13;
Procurement&#13;
39.   The proposed procurement arrangements are summarized in the table below and are in line with&#13;
the "Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated January 1995. The proposed&#13;
project procurement plan is in Appendix 5. In case of parallel financing (such as funding by the&#13;
European Commission or by bilateral donors), the applicable procurement procedures of the respective&#13;
financiers would be applied. To respond in a timely fashion to the post-war emergency situation in the&#13;
Federation, the below-described procurement methods would be used for Bank-financed procurement.&#13;

a/ Figures in parenthesis represent Bank financing.&#13;
b/  Consultant services consist of a number of individual consultants. Their services would be procured in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
guidelines for selection of consultants.&#13;
c/  Commercial services comprise procurement agent fees, transport and inspection of goods. These serv ices would be procured in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's guidelines for the selection of consultants.&#13;
d/  Recurrent costs include office rent, utilities, local staff cost, chemicals and expendable materials.&#13;
40.      Goods.  The aggregate value of goods to be procured with Bank funding would not exceed&#13;
US$0.6 million. Therefore, procurement procedures for goods would be limited to International&#13;
Shopping (IS) and National Shopping (NS). Direct Contracting (DC) for goods would be provided for&#13;
in the Credit Agreement, but at the present no DC of goods is anticipated. For IS, NS and DC, the limits&#13;
and procedures would be as follows:&#13;
(a)      IS/NS. International Shopping  (IS) would  be used  for procuring  equipment and materials&#13;
estimated to cost between US$200,000 and US$2.0 million per contract. Awards would&#13;
be based on comparison of price quotations obtained from at least three suppliers in two&#13;
countries. A sample document, including contract conditions, has been prepared by the&#13;
Bank and would be used for IS contracts. National Shopping (NS) would be used for&#13;
goods available within BH, such as office furniture and supplies, up to an estimated cost&#13;
of US$ 200,000 per contract with at least three quotations from national suppliers. The&#13;
aggregate amount of Bank-financed goods using IS would not exceed US$0.5 million.&#13;
The aggregate amount of Bank-financed goods bid using NS would not exceed US$0.1&#13;
million.&#13;
(b)      DC.    Direct Contracting (DC) would be used for proprietary items, for reasons of compatibility&#13;
or standardization, as well as for reasons of timing. No DC is foreseen for those goods&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 14&#13;
financed by the Bank. Any DC during project implementation would require prior Bank&#13;
approval. Existing contracts would not be extended. At the time of project appraisal,&#13;
no DC was anticipated.&#13;
41.   Contracted Works. For works carried out under contract, the following procedures would be&#13;
followed:&#13;
(a)   ICB.  ICB would apply for works contracts estimated to cost more than $5.0 million each.&#13;
Regarding advertising procedures, a General Procurement Notice (GPN) would be&#13;
published in the "Development Business" and the local press in March 1996 (see&#13;
Appendix 6). The notice would include information about the nature of goods and&#13;
services to be procured and invite interested and eligible contractors to send their&#13;
expressions of interest to VBH. A specific advertisement for prequalification and&#13;
individual contracts would appear in the local press. Copies of the advertisement would&#13;
be sent to contractors who respond to the GPN. The Bank's Standard Bidding Document&#13;
for Works would be used. Any modification would be approved by the Bank prior to the&#13;
documents being issued. Bid and payment currency would be limited to one currency&#13;
widely used in international trade. The aggregate amount of Bank-financed works bid&#13;
using ICB would not exceed US$10.3 million.&#13;
(b)    NCB. Because foreign contractors are unlikely to be interested in small works that would be&#13;
widely dispersed, National Competitive Bidding (NCB) would be used for works&#13;
contracts between US$1.0 and US$5.0 million per contract.  Interested foreign&#13;
contractors would be allowed to tender for NCB contracts. Contractors for NCB would&#13;
be prequalified. The procedure would differ from the Bank's normal procedure in that&#13;
an open registry of prequalified contractors would be kept and based on information&#13;
submitted contractors would be prequalified by category of works and contract price. A&#13;
prequalification notice would be put in the local press at least once during project&#13;
implementation but could be repeated if more firms are needed. The prequalification&#13;
document would be approved by the Bank. The ECA Region's sample document for&#13;
works using NCB dated September 1995 would be used for all tenders. The currency&#13;
of the bid and contract would be Deutsche Marks. Announcements of tenders would be&#13;
sent only to contractors on the registry that meet the minimum requirements of the&#13;
tender. The aggregate amount of Bank-financed works bid using NCB would not exceed&#13;
US$2.5 million.&#13;
(c)    SWP. Small Works Procurement (SWP) would be used for works contracts estimated to cost&#13;
less than US$1.0 million per contract. Contracts would be lump sum, fixed price&#13;
contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three qualified contractors in&#13;
response to a written invitation. The invitation would include a detailed description of&#13;
the works, the basic specifications, the required completion period, a basic form of&#13;
agreement and drawings when relevant. The award would be made to the contractor who&#13;
offers the lowest price. The aggregate amount of Bank-financed Works bid using SNCB&#13;
would not exceed US$1.6 million.&#13;
42.   Force Account Works (FA). For the installation of equipment and minor repair work within the&#13;
capability of the staff of municipal water, sanitation and solid waste organizations and valued at less than&#13;
$150,000, FA would be allowed. To qualify, organizations would need to demonstrate that they have&#13;
the equipment, capacity and experience to undertake the work. The total value of FA permitted any one&#13;
municipality would be limited to US$0.5 million. FA work would be paid on the basis of standard unit&#13;
prices developed from the bids received for similar work carried out by private contractors. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 15&#13;
aggregate amount of Bank-financed works bid using FA would not exceed $2.0 million.&#13;
43.   Recurrent Costs, Tuition and Travel. VBH and other municipalities that qualify for incremental&#13;
operating costs would be reimbursed monthly based on an approved program and budget. Tuition and&#13;
travel would be reimbursed based on actual expenditures. The aggregate amount of Bank-financed&#13;
recurrent costs, tuition and travel would not exceed US$1.3 million.&#13;
44.   Consultants and Commercial Services. Consultant and commercial services would be procured&#13;
in accordance with Bank guidelines which shall include both competition, sole sourcing and the selection&#13;
of individual consultants. The sole sourcing would be justified in each case. Such justifications may be&#13;
the timing constraint, continuity, unique expertise, and lack of candidates given the situation in BH.&#13;
Follow-up assignments would be permissible to the extent that they are indicated in the initial Terms of&#13;
Reference for the assignments. The aggregate value of Bank-financed consulting and commercial services&#13;
is estimated at US$1.7 million of which US$1.0 million would be through shortlisting of firms and&#13;
US$0.7 million would be for individual consultants, representing assignments of specialized and short&#13;
term nature.&#13;
45.   Procurement Implementation Capacitv. At present, VBH lacks the capacity to undertake the&#13;
procurement under the project without outside assistance. Local consultants under the direction of VBH's&#13;
Project Development Department, would carry out all the procurement for works under the Project. To&#13;
instruct its own staff and the local consultants, VBH will seek the assistance of the procurement advisors&#13;
engaged for the Emergency Recovery Project (approved by the Board on February 29, 1996). Because&#13;
most of the goods would be procured by the contractors for the works, procurement agents (PA) for most&#13;
of the goods to be procured under the project would not be required. In cases where it is necessary to&#13;
procure goods separately, VBH would seek the assistance of the procurement unit of the Emergency&#13;
Recovery Project or employ an individual procurement consultants on a contract by contract basis.&#13;
46.   Prior and Post Bank Review of Procurement Documents. Bank Standard Bidding Documents&#13;
would be used for ICB procurement packages for works. The Bank Standard Prequalification Document&#13;
would be used to prequalify works contractors for ICB. A simplified prequalification document prepared&#13;
by VBH would be used to prequalify works contractors for NCB. Sample bidding documents prepared&#13;
by the Bank would be used for NCB and IS. These documents would be used also for procurement under&#13;
the Project. All ICB contracts for works, the first three contracts for NCB and IS, all contracts for DC&#13;
and agreements for works to be carried by FA would be subject to the Bank's prior review as stated in&#13;
the Procurement Guidelines. Also, prequalification documents for both ICB and NCB would be reviewed&#13;
prior to being issued, and the results of all prequalification results would be subject to prior review. For&#13;
consultants' contracts, the Bank's standard form for consultants' contracts would be used. Terms of&#13;
reference for all consultant contracts with firms above US$100,000, contracts with individuals above&#13;
US$50,000 and sole source contracts, if any, would be subject to the Bank's prior review. Post reviews&#13;
of procurement actions would be carried out on a quarterly basis by Bank supervision missions.&#13;
47.   Local Control of Procurement. In order to ensure transparency in procurement arrangements for&#13;
the Project, especially because there would be a large number of small civil works contracts, likely to&#13;
be financed by local firms, during negotiations agreement was reached with the Borrower that they would&#13;
cause the Federation to establish a water management sector Procurement Review Committee. The&#13;
Committee would be responsible for ensuring compliance with Bank and donor procurement procedures&#13;
and approving all contract awards. Membership of the Committee would comprise the Director of VBH&#13;
who would serve as secretary, an Assistant Minister of Agriculture, Water Resources and Forestry who&#13;
would serve as chairman and three other members, one of which would be from a municipality&#13;
participating the Project. IMG would advise the Committee on technical and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Technical Annex&#13;
Page 16&#13;
procurement matters, as needed. Organizationally, the Committee be an adjunct to the Ministry of&#13;
Agriculture, Water Resources and Forestry with the Minister responsible for making the appointments.&#13;
Disbursements&#13;
48.   The estiniated schedule of disbursements is given in Table 5. Disbursements are expected to be&#13;
completed within a period of three years from the date of effectiveness. The Bank credit would finance&#13;
the categories of expenditures outlined in Table 6. In the case of works, to ensure that Bank funds would&#13;
not be used to finance taxes, it was agreed during negotiations that the disbursement percentage for works&#13;
specified in the Credit Agreement would specifically exclude disbursements for taxes. The costs for&#13;
works included in the project cost estimate were calculated on the assumption that no taxes are collected&#13;
for works. During negotiations, it was agreed that if any change occurs which has the effect of levying&#13;
and collecting taxes in relation to works, the disbursement percentage for works would be reduced by&#13;
amendment to the Credit Agreement.&#13;

49.    Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation, the Recipient would establish,&#13;
maintain and operate, under conditions acceptable to the Bank, a Special Account in U.S. dollars in the&#13;
Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina or a commercial bank. The authorized allocation of the Special&#13;
Account would be limited to US$ 2.0 million, representing about four months (average) disbursement of&#13;
the Bank's share of estimated expenditures expected to be paid from the Special Account. Replenishment&#13;
applications would be forwarded to the Bank at least every three months, and would include reconciled&#13;
bank statements as well as other appropriate documents.&#13;
50.    Statement of Expenditures. Disbursements would be made against Statements of Expenditures&#13;
(SOEs) for the following types of expenditures:&#13;

Detailed documents evidencing expenditures would be reviewed by VBH and made available for the&#13;
required audit as well as Bank supervision missions. Disbursements for contracts exceeding the above&#13;
limits would be made against presentation to the Bank of full contract documentation.&#13;
51.   Credit Closing Date. The Credit closing date would be June 30, 1999.&#13;
Accounts, Auditing and Reporting&#13;
52.   Accounts.  During negotianions, agreement was reached on the following arrangments for&#13;
accounting, auditing and reporting. Separate and auditable accounts would be established by VBH for&#13;
the Project. These accounts would include: (i) a record of all commitments and expenditures; (ii) a&#13;
record of withdrawals from all funding sources including the Bank Credit (Trust Fund); (iii) copies of&#13;
all disbursement requests and underlying documentation; and (iv) a record of transactions on the Special&#13;
Account and the copies of the bank statements on this account. Technical assistance has been included&#13;
under the Project to establish proper accounts and financial controlling procedures.&#13;
53.    Audits. The project accounts would be audited annually by independent auditors and under terms&#13;
of reference acceptable to the Bank. Separate audit statements would be prepared for the Special Account&#13;
and for Statement of Expenditures. All audit reports would be made available to the Bank at the latest&#13;
six months after the end of the fiscal year. Project accounts would be maintained for one year after the&#13;
closing date.&#13;
54.   Reporting. VHB would prepare and furnish to the Bank a quarterly progress report showing the&#13;
status of implementation of the Project as well as a financial report in a format acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
Supervision Plan&#13;
55.   Project implementation would incorporate a large degree of flexibility in view of the fact that it&#13;
would need to adapt to rapidly changing circumstances in the country. Implementation progress would&#13;
be formally evaluated at mid-term, i.e. approximately 6 months after effectiveness. In addition, during&#13;
the first 6 months of implementation, the Bank's new Resident Mission in Sarajevo would continuously&#13;
supervise all initial project implementation steps, and would assist closely on matters requiring advice and&#13;
rapid decisions by the Bank. In particular, procurement and disbursements would require intensive&#13;
supervision.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the Water, Sanitation
            and Solid Waste Urgent Works Project are to: (i) restore
            water, sanitation and solid waste services to the population
            depending on pipe water supply and water borne sewerage
            systems to a level that would mitigate public health risk in
            priority areas; (ii) develop a long term sector strategy and
            the details of an emergency project consistent with the
            strategy; (iii) rebuild and strengthen sector institutions
            so that the improvements will be sustainable; and (iv)
            prepare final designs and bidding documents for the
            rehabilitation project. The project consists of five parts:
            (a) the supply of equipment and materials, including pipe,
            fittings, spare parts and rolling stock for water, sewerage
            and solid waste disposal operating organizations to meet
            urgent requirements for systems operations; (b) urgent works
            for the provision of water supply, sanitation and solid
            waste services for municipalities, including rehabilitation
            and repair of water sources and distribution networks; (c)
            emergency development plan for the water management sector;
            (d) institutional strengthening, focusing on strategic
            planning and sector organization, project, financial and
            maintenance management, computer skills and reduction of
            unaccounted-for water; and (e) preparation of the water,
            sanitation and solid waste rehabilitation project.
