A.      STRATEGIC CONTEXT AND RATIONALE&#13;
&#13;
    1. GLOBAL     AND NATIONAL ISSUES&#13;
&#13;
1.      Global Situation. Influenza i s an acute viral disease o f the respiratory tract caused by&#13;
influenza viruses A, B or C. These A, B and C viruses are antigenically distinct and there is no&#13;
cross immunitybetween them. While all three influenza viruses may affect humans, inlower&#13;
animals andbirds, influenza A viruses are o fprimaryconcern. InfluenzaA viruses are divided&#13;
into subtypes based on two glycoproteins (haemagglutinin andneuraminidase antigens) present&#13;
on the surface o f the virus. There are 16 haemagglutinin (H)antigens (1 to 16) and 9&#13;
neuraminidase (N)antigens (1 to 9).&#13;
&#13;
2.      Each century has witnessed an average o f three pandemics o f Influenzaoccurring at&#13;
intervals rangingfrom 10 to 50 years, startingwithout warning and spreading rapidly worldwide&#13;
causing illness o funprecedented proportions. The great influenzapandemic o f 1918-1919&#13;
caused illness inmore than25% o fthe total population, with an estimated 40-50 million deaths&#13;
within a year. The pandemics in 1957 and 1968 were causedbymildviruses, but still killed 1-4&#13;
millionpeople.&#13;
&#13;
3.      The current epidemic o f HighlyPathogenic Avian Influenza(HPAI) was first detected on&#13;
12 December 2003 inthe Republic o fKorea. The increasingnumber o f outbreaks o f HPAI&#13;
caused by influenza A virus type H5N1 inseveral South East Asian countries (since 2003) and&#13;
more recently inEurope and NorthAfrica have raised serious global health concerns. To date&#13;
about 200 million poultry have either died or have been destroyed. According to OIE, 53&#13;
countries have reported avian influenza until 5th September 2006. Inhumans, according to&#13;
WHO, there were 247 cases o f avian influenzawith 144 deaths (WHO September 19,2006). The&#13;
maximumnumber o f deaths has been reported from Viet Nam, Indonesia, Thailand and China&#13;
andpotential social and economic disruption is unprecedented. Economic losses resulting from&#13;
AvianInfluenza inAsia alone have already exceededUS$ 10billion. Despite the control&#13;
measures, the disease continues to spread inmost o f the countries affected, causing economic&#13;
losses, threatening the livelihoods o fpoor livestock farmers, compromising entrepreneurship and&#13;
poultry production, affecting international trade and market opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
4.      The persistence o f HPAIsince 2003 has fuelled warnings that a global pandemic is&#13;
imminent andinevitable for the following reasons:&#13;
        The epidemics causedby avian influenza are affecting progressively a larger number o f&#13;
        countries with evidence for spread to previously unaffected countries. The epidemic i s&#13;
        spreading geographically within the countries and affecting larger number o f intermediate&#13;
        hosts.&#13;
    0   The strain o fH5N1is highlypathogenic, associated with very highcase fatality rates.&#13;
    0   There i s evidence for animal-to-animal transmission andoccasionally animal to human&#13;
        transmissionbut no clear case o fhuman-to-human transmission o f the disease.&#13;
    0   Influenzavirus i s highlyunstable andits behavior is unpredictable. There are concerns&#13;
        about the re-assortment o f the virus andmutations into a new strain with a potential for&#13;
        humanto humantransmission.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        Influenzapandemics duringthe 20thcentury have been devastating with millions o f&#13;
        deaths.&#13;
&#13;
5.      Avianinfluenza viruses are not easily transmitted to humans,butthis can change due to&#13;
mutations or genetic re-assortment (mixingof humanand animal influenza genes). Continuous&#13;
transmission o f avian influenza and gradual expansion o f the host range andthe geographical&#13;
spread increase the possibility o f influenza pandemic emerging inthe near future.&#13;
&#13;
6.      Situation andResponse inIndia: Indiamoved into Phase I1HPAIPandemic Alert with&#13;
the outbreaks o f H5N1 Influenzaamong domestic fowl inseveral intensively managed organized&#13;
poultry farms inNawapur inNandurbarDistrict inMaharashtraandUchchal inSurat District o f&#13;
Gujarat. The occurrence o f the disease inIndiais reported to have started on January 27,2006.&#13;
Indiawas one o f the 13 countries (inorder o f reporting: Iraq, Nigeria, Azerbaijan, Bulgaria,&#13;
Greece, Italy, Slovenia, Iran, Austria, Germany, Egypt, India andFrance) that have reported their&#13;
first cases o f H5N1 infection inbirds since the beginning o f February2006.&#13;
&#13;
7.      Though random sero-surveillance o fpoultry across the country and o fmigratory birds in&#13;
their nestinghabitats inwater bodies was inforce from 2001 as an early warningmechanism for&#13;
HPAIinIndia, the outbreaks inNawapur, Maharashtrainitially escapednotice andwere actually&#13;
brought to official recognition through local alerts o f large scale mortality among caged birds in&#13;
organizedpoultry farms inNawapur, MaharashtraandUchchal, Gujarat beginning the last week&#13;
o f January and continuing through most o f February. Onconfirmation o f HPAI(H5N1)&#13;
outbreak bythe HighSecurity Animal Disease Laboratory (HSADL), Bhopal, on February 18,&#13;
2006, the Central and State Governments and the Local Authorities swunginto action with&#13;
alacrity and stamped out the infection inthis area by the end o f Februarythrough: (i) and&#13;
                                                                                        strict&#13;
mandatory zoo-sanitary measures; (ii) and destructiono f in-contact as well as all&#13;
                                         culling&#13;
susceptible poultry (inorganized farms as well as backyards), in-contact feed stocks and eggs&#13;
within aradius o f0-10 km; (iii) healthmeasures such as active surveillance of all families&#13;
                                  public&#13;
inthe areabyhouseto house search, isolationandhospitalization ofall suspectedhumancases;&#13;
(iv) awareness campaigns; and(v) restriction o fmovement o fhumanbeings andlive poultry /&#13;
poultry products inand out o f the infectedzones. Following an intensive surveillance o f in-&#13;
contact personnel, households and labor force, the Authorities (Ministryo f HealthandFamily&#13;
Welfare) have now concludedthat there were no cases o f HPAI(H5N1) infection among human&#13;
beings inthe area.&#13;
&#13;
8.      HPAI(H5N1) againbroke out among free rangingindigenous fowl inbackyards in&#13;
several villages (Marul, Savda, Hated and Salva) o fthe Jalgaon District o f Maharashtra, spread&#13;
over an area o fnearly 150km2, officially recognized on March 14,2006. Here again the&#13;
outbreak o fthe diseasewas noticed on account o f local alerts ofhighmortality rates among the&#13;
free ranging fowl inbackyards invillages startingfrom the end o fFebruary and confirmed as&#13;
HPAI(H5N1) bythe HSADL,Bhopalonthe 14thofMarch. Vigorous Control andContainment&#13;
procedures were set inmotion andculling o fbackyard fowl, destruction and disposal o f all&#13;
susceptible species o fpoultry, back yard as well as farm flocks, contaminated feed stocks and&#13;
eggs, inareas 0-10 kmradius around all foci o finfection were carried out.&#13;
&#13;
9.      While the outbreaks ingroups o fvillages inJalgaon reported on 14thMarchwere&#13;
brought under control, serum samples from other villages inthe area (Varad, Paldhi, Bhadgaon&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and Parola) andfrom villages across the border inMadhya Pradesh (Ichchapur, Burhanpur&#13;
District) sent to the HSADL tested positive on March28th. This campaign was widened to a&#13;
larger number o f villages inthe Jalgaon district (Pachora, Mehunbare, Nandra, Mohida,&#13;
Muktainagar, Salbardi, Kamkheda, Pimpri, Vitava, Sakali, Weghari, Nandgaon andBodarde)&#13;
after new samples tested positive on April 4-5,2006, Three other villages (Janave, Jalgaon,&#13;
Ichkheda; all inJalgaon district) were included inthe campaign after some samples originating&#13;
from this location were reported positive on April 18,2006.&#13;
&#13;
10.     The control measures adopted inall the outbreaks were stamping out o f entire poultry&#13;
population including destruction o f eggs, feed, consumables, litter andother infectedmaterials&#13;
around 10 Km. area surrounding each outbreak location, restrictions on movement o fpoultry,&#13;
poultry products andpersonnelto andfrom the area o f outbreak, disinfection andcleaning up o f&#13;
the infectedpremises etc. A total o f 1,044,509 birdshave reportedlybeen culled (Surat district&#13;
inGujarat: 91,886; Nandurbar andJalgaon districts inMaharashtra: 323,585 and 616,195&#13;
respectively; Burhanpurdistrict inMadhya Pradesh: 12,843). Followingthe last outbreak&#13;
reportedon April 18,2006, final cleaningup and disinfection process was completed on 7 May,&#13;
2006. Inall cases o f outbreaks inMaharashtra, Gujarat and Madhya Pradeshthe state&#13;
governments have paid compensation on the spot for back yard birds destroyed as well as to&#13;
commercial operators upon completion o f the cleaning-up and disinfection process.&#13;
&#13;
11.     Suspected humancases isolated andhospitalized, in-contact personnel, labor force and&#13;
households under surveillance inthe area have all tested negative for H5N1 infection. Rapid&#13;
response teams and State / Central authorities have ensured compliance o f all mandatory zoo-&#13;
sanitary / public health measures.&#13;
&#13;
12.     Following Article 2.7.12.4 o fthe OIE Terrestrial Animal Health Code (2005), which&#13;
states that a country may regain its status as an avian influenza-free country three months after a&#13;
stamping-out policy (including disinfection o f all affected establishments) is applied, provided&#13;
that surveillance inaccordance with prevailing guidelines has been carried out duringthat three-&#13;
month period, India notified OIE accordingly on August 11,2006. Since November 24, 2005 up&#13;
untilthisnotification, the HSADLinBhopalhas tested a total o fabout 75,000 samples. Despite&#13;
analysis conducted byHSADLthe source o f the outbrealdorigin o f the infection remains&#13;
inconclusive, although migratory birds are on top o fthe likely suspects.&#13;
&#13;
13.     Preparatory Actions taken by the Authorities: The Government o f Indiaestablished a&#13;
Joint Monitoring Group on January 27,2004 under the chairmanship o f the Director General o f&#13;
Health Services consisting o f officials from the Ministryo fHealth &amp; FamilyWelfare, Indian&#13;
Council o fMedical Research, National Institute o f Communicable Diseases, Delhi, World&#13;
Health Organization andthe representatives o fthe Department o f Animal Husbandry, Dairying&#13;
and Fisheries to monitor the situation andrecommend appropriate actions. The Joint Monitoring&#13;
Group is meeting regularly. Technical guidelines on clinical management, laboratory andpublic&#13;
healthmeasures have been drawn up and the group i sjointly monitoring for evidence o fH5N1 in&#13;
the country.&#13;
&#13;
14.     The Ministryo f Home Affairs has been requested to keep vigil on the movement o f&#13;
poultry/related articles through the security agencies inthe borders. Similarly, other concerned&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Ministries like Shipping (movement o fpoultry/related articles through the ports), Environment&#13;
andForests (unusual deaths o fbirds inthe sanctuaries etc.) havebeenalerted.&#13;
&#13;
15.     The National Institute o f Communicable Diseases, Delhi has been identified as the nodal&#13;
agency to investigate any suspected cases/ outbreak among the humanpopulation and the&#13;
laboratories o f IndianCouncil o f Medical Research (National Institute o f Virology, Pune) and&#13;
National Institute o f Communicable Diseases, Delhi have been identified for laboratory&#13;
diagnosis o fhumaninfluenza. A special issue o f `CD Alert', a monthly newsletter o fNational&#13;
Institute o f CommunicableDiseases, on Avian Influenza (BirdFlu)has beenpublished and&#13;
widely circulated to all States andUnionterritories for sharingo f information.&#13;
&#13;
16.     Under the aegis o f ICMR, an initiative to study the strains o fHumanInfluenza, age group&#13;
affected and seasonality inIndiathrough surveillance has beenlaunched. Fivecenters have been&#13;
identified for this project; (i)&#13;
                               All IndiaInstitute o fMedical Sciences, (ii) Viral Unit,&#13;
                                                                            Entero&#13;
Kolkata, (iii) Regional Medical Research Centre, Dibrugarh, (iv) King Institute, Chennai and (v)&#13;
National Institute o fVirology, Pune. Initial training has been completed. Essential equipments&#13;
andconsumables havebeenprocured. WHO is also sending the requisitekits.The laboratory o f&#13;
NICD has also been strengthened to take up such activities.&#13;
&#13;
17.     The Ministry o fEnvironment &amp; Forests, Bombay Natural History Society, Wetland&#13;
International and similar interested groups have been alerted to carry out surveillance and&#13;
monitor the migratory and other wild birds for any unusual sickness or mortality. The wild life&#13;
personnel andrepresentatives o f various other birdwatching groups are being trained byDADF&#13;
to collect suitable material for surveillance through laboratory examination. Droppings and other&#13;
clinical or suspected material o f migratory/wild birds is to be collected and sent to the designated&#13;
laboratory for the purpose o fproper diagnosis. Inthe event o f unusual deaths inmigratory/wild&#13;
birds, written instructionhas beengiven to staffby Ministryo fEnvironment &amp; Forests to&#13;
transport appropriate material to the identified laboratory for diagnosis.&#13;
&#13;
18.     Random sample surveillance indomestic poultry has been carried out for the last four&#13;
years. Surveillance has beenintensifiedinpoultry farms locatednear ground water&#13;
bodies/sanctuaries identified bythe Ministryo f Environment &amp; Forests as being visitedby&#13;
migratory/wild birds for their winter nesting.&#13;
&#13;
19.     The laboratory identifiedfor the purpose o fdiagnosis and also surveillance is the High&#13;
Security Animal Disease Laboratory (HSADL) located at Bhopal with Indian Council o f&#13;
Agricultural Research (ICAR). All birds imported from HPAIfree counties are subjected to&#13;
quarantine and screening against possibility o f introduction o f the disease through these birds.&#13;
There i s a total baninplace against import o fpoultry, poultry products other identifiedrelated&#13;
products from countries which are continuing with HPAIor had exposure inrecent times.&#13;
&#13;
The Directorate General o fHealth Services publishedinDecember 2005 a "Contingency Plan&#13;
for Management o f HumanCases o fAvian Influenza". Similarly, the Department o fAnimal&#13;
Husbandry,DairyingandFisheries publishedinNovember 2005 an"Action Planfor State&#13;
Animal HusbandryDepartments inRespect o f BirdFlu". Both contingency plans have been&#13;
prepared inclose collaboration and as per the standardguidelines WHO andFA0respectively.&#13;
Although training o fpersonnel was continuing at the time when the first HPAIoutbreak was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
confirmed on February 18,2006, concerned GO1Departments didhave a clear roadmap on how&#13;
to go about launching an effective response when the need o f doing so presented itself.&#13;
According to WHO and FAO, implementation o f these contingency plans&#13;
&#13;
20.     Besides the above-mentioned contingency plans, GOI, through the Joint Monitoring&#13;
Group, has prepareda Country Program for Preparedness, Control and Containment o fAvian&#13;
Influenza. This Program was presented by GO1at the Global AI Conference inBeijing in&#13;
January 2006. It consists o f seven components, including: (i)    planningandcoordination; (ii)&#13;
surveillance and laboratory support; (iii) (iv) strengthening hospital systems; (v) outbreak&#13;
                                            IEC;&#13;
control program; (vi) development o fhumanresource capacities; and (vii) strengthening&#13;
quarantine facilities. Additional investments required for support have been estimated at about&#13;
US$74.4 million equivalent.&#13;
&#13;
21.     A comprehensive communication strategy hasbeenpreparedjointly bythe MOHFWand&#13;
DADF, inpartnershipwithUNICEF andWHO as apart o fIndia's contingencyplanto respond&#13;
to the AI pandemic threat. The overarching objective o fthis strategy i s to protect humanhealth,&#13;
especially among families engaged inbackyard poultry farming, from AI. The strategy involves&#13;
focused communication approaches for communities at risk, buildingcommunication skills o f&#13;
front-line workers and ensures consistent political and social commitment. A roadmap for its&#13;
implementationhas been prepared after carrying out the preliminary work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    2. RATIONALEFORBANKINVOLVEMENT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
22.     India launched the IntegratedDisease Surveillance Project (IDSP) with support from the&#13;
World Bank inNovember 2004. This project aims to improve information available to the&#13;
government health services andprivate health care providers on a set o f high-priority diseases&#13;
and risk factors, with a view to improving the on-the-ground responses to such diseases andrisk&#13;
factors. The project will cover all the states andUnion Territories (UTs) ina phasedmanner by&#13;
2009 with an estimated total cost o fRs. 4083 million. Itplans to establish disease surveillance&#13;
units at the central, state anddistrict levels, using information technology for communication and&#13;
data analysis. The diseases included under regular surveillance include malaria, acute diarrhoeal&#13;
disease (including cholera), typhoid, tuberculosis, measles, polio, roadtraffic accidents, plague,&#13;
meningo-encepahlitis/ respiratory distress, Heamorrhagic fevers, andother undiagnosed&#13;
conditions (causing death hospitalization. Sentinel surveillance includes HIV/HBV, HCV,&#13;
Water quality, Outdoor air quality. Regularperiodic surveys includeN C D risk factors like&#13;
Obesity, Physical inactivity, BloodPressure, Tobacco and alcohol use etc. Provision is also made&#13;
for surveillance o f state specific diseases (not exceeding five ina state). Under the "Unusual&#13;
Clinical Syndromes" category, diseases like SARS and Avian Influenza can be covered under the&#13;
Project. This point was reiterated and confirmed duringNegotiations with the Government and&#13;
recordedinthe Minutes.&#13;
&#13;
23.     Followinga request from DEAreceived on January 19,2006 to support India's Country&#13;
Program for Preparedness, Control and Containment o f Avian Influenza, the Bank has been&#13;
working with GO1andother relevant stakeholders to define its contribution ina manner aimed at&#13;
maximizing value-added, while ensuringthat specified efforts complement possible support to&#13;
India's Country Program from other sources. Inresponse to a letter from DEAreceived on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
February 27th, 2006 concerning how to go about defining possible Bank support, it was agreed&#13;
andconfirmedthrough a communicationfrom the Bankto DEA, dated March7,2006, that the&#13;
on-going IntegratedDisease SurveillanceProject (IDSP) would be the primaryvehicle for&#13;
delivering such support. This is inview of: (i)  the strong linkages between the nature o fthe&#13;
Project and the orientation o f India's Country Program for Preparedness, Control and&#13;
Containment ofAvianInfluenza; and(ii) role o fMinistry o f Health as boththe executing&#13;
                                           the&#13;
agency o f IDSP and as nodal agency for India's Avian Influenza (AI) preparedness and control&#13;
efforts.&#13;
&#13;
24.     GOI's planto respondto the threat posedbyAI fits well with the overall objectives o f&#13;
IDSP. The planaims to minimize the threat posedto humans by HPAIas a part o fpreparation&#13;
for the prevention, control and response to influenzapandemic. Through the strengthening o f&#13;
laboratory services, use o f information technology, revampingof surveillance andhuman&#13;
resource development, it i s proposedto address the problem o ftransmission o fAI to humans.&#13;
Theproposalto include seasonal influenza surveillance will contribute to influenza pandemic&#13;
preparedness and response. The strengthening o f laboratory networks will also be very usefbl in&#13;
investigating other viral syndromes, especially seasonal influenza, andunusual outbreaks.&#13;
Furthermore, supporting India's AI preparedness planwill provide a unique opportunity to&#13;
strengthen cross-sector coordination for addressing zoonotic diseases, which are posing new and&#13;
growing challenges inthe 21Stcentury.&#13;
&#13;
25.     This restructuring will be done under the frame work o f Global Program for Avian&#13;
Influenza Control and HumanPandemic Preparedness andResponse (GPAI)&#13;
&#13;
        PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
    1. PROJECTDEVELOPMENTOBJECTIVEAND KEYINDICATORS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
26.     The existing Project Development Objective of IDSP is to improve the information&#13;
available to the government health sewices andprivate health careproviders on a set of high-&#13;
priority diseases and riskfactors, with a view to improving the on-the-ground responses to such&#13;
diseases and riskfactors.&#13;
&#13;
27.     For the purposes o f the AI component to be added to the Project, and inview o f the&#13;
integration o f a more explicit animal health dimension inthe activities o f the project, along with&#13;
the incorporation ofthe Department o fAnimal Husbandry, Dairying andFisheries as an&#13;
executing agency o fthe Project, a supporting Development Objective i s proposed along the&#13;
following lines: to minimize the threat in Indiaposed to humans by Highly Pathogenic Avian&#13;
Influenza infection and other zoonosesfrom domesticpoultry andpreparefor theprevention,&#13;
control and response to an influenza pandemic in humans.&#13;
&#13;
28.     Keyaspects o foverall performanceo fAI-related activities under the Projectwill be&#13;
assessed usingthe following additional outcome indicator:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Evidence o f improved effectiveness o fparticipating animal andpublic health services in&#13;
detecting and diagnosing HPAIinfection and, once confirmed, limitingthe spread o f an HPAI&#13;
outbreak and consequent pandemic inIndia. This will be measured by:&#13;
        Establishment o f a surveillance system covering backyardpoultry, commercial poultry&#13;
        farms and nestinghreeding habitats o f migratory birds.&#13;
        Ability o fanimal healthdepartments andIDSPrapidresponse teams at district level to&#13;
        investigate at least 90% o f suspected AI outbreaks within24 hrs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    2. FINANCING     INSTRUMENT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
29.     Support to India's Country Program for Preparedness, Control and Containment o f Avian&#13;
Influenzawill beprovided under the ongoing IntegratedDisease SurveillanceProject (Cr.3952&#13;
IN)bycreatingaseparateAIComponent andincludingthe DepartmentofAnimalHusbandry,&#13;
Dairying and Fisheries as a new executing agency under the Project. Proposed Bank financing to&#13;
India's Country Program for Preparedness, Control and Containment o fAvian Influenzais&#13;
estimated at US$32.63 million while GO1will be providing additional US32.26 million for&#13;
activities not covered under the Credit such as provision of anti retroviral drugs, medical care,&#13;
compensation for culling, vaccination o fbirds andhonorarium for reporting at grampanchayat&#13;
level.&#13;
&#13;
30.     Given that it i s difficult to quantify with precision requiredresources for the&#13;
implementation o f India's Country Program for Preparedness, Control and Containment o f Avian&#13;
Influenza, andconsidering the uncertainties concerning available financing from other sources in&#13;
support o f this Program, use o fthe IntegratedDisease SurveillanceProject as the primaryvehicle&#13;
for AI support provides more flexibility. After exact expenditures mobilized for AI purpose are&#13;
known, supplemental financing couldbe made available to IDSP to compensate the Project for&#13;
the additional costs associatedwith AI preparedness and control that were not envisaged at the&#13;
time o fProject preparation(inorder to enable the IDSP to achieve its original objectives).&#13;
&#13;
31.     All the components withrespect to animal health that are included inthe technical annex&#13;
will be h d e dbyIDSP. The compensation for the culled birds, animal feed destroyed will not be&#13;
covered bythe Bankproject. For the humanhealth, the project already supports integrated&#13;
disease surveillance. The additional inputswill therefore cover laboratory strengthening for&#13;
surveillance o f viral diseases, computer hardware and connectivity for improved information&#13;
exchange with laboratories, and training. The project will also provide additional financing&#13;
required for implementing the AI communication strategy. The project will not cover supply o f&#13;
anti-virals which are already stockpiled by GOI, strengthening o fthe hospitals, andvaccines.&#13;
However, details o fthese components are included inthe technical annex for humanhealth to&#13;
reflect the overall national approach.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    3. PROJECT     COMPONENTS&#13;
&#13;
32.     The additional component to the Project, Support to India's Country Programfor&#13;
Preparedness, Control and Containment of Avian Influenza, will be divided into three parts,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
including: (a) humanhealth (b) animal health; and (c) public awareness andcoordination&#13;
support.&#13;
&#13;
    A. HumanHealth&#13;
&#13;
33.    The overall scope o f the humanhealth component (additional to existing IDSP) will&#13;
include (i)  Strengthening o fPublic Health Surveillance including rapid response (ii)  improving&#13;
access to anti viral drugs and emergency medical care. Out o fthese Strengthening o f Public&#13;
Health Surveillancewill be financed bythe Bank through IDSP as it fits inthe project's&#13;
development objectives and GO1will be financing the remaining objectives.&#13;
&#13;
I.StrengtheningPublicHealthSurveillanceandLaboratoryCapacity. Standardcasedefinitions&#13;
for suspected, probable and confirmed case o fAvian Influenzawould be adopted to ensure&#13;
uniformity across the country. Formats designed for IDSP would be usedand suitably modified,&#13;
wherever required for surveillance. Incase o f confirmed cases inpoultry, active screening o f&#13;
exposed and at-risk population would be carried out for requiredduration. Three main&#13;
components are proposed. These include the following:&#13;
&#13;
         A 1.1ImprovementinLaboratoryNetwork: Itis intendedto strengthen laboratory&#13;
        surveillance network under IDSP for diagnosis o f humanseasonal and avian influenza&#13;
        andpandemic influenza for effective preventionandcontrol. The overarching objective&#13;
        o f this component is to improve surveillance o f viral pneumonia andinfluenza like illness&#13;
        andstrengthen capacity o flaboratory network under IDSPfor diagnosis o fhuman&#13;
        influenza (seasonal and avian) andpandemic influenza and other emerginginfectious&#13;
        diseases through laboratory strengthening andhumancapacity building.&#13;
&#13;
       A 1.2Healthinformation andcommunication: Software for Disease Surveillanceis being&#13;
        developed under IDSP. However, it may take a few months for it to be fully operational.&#13;
        A rapidinformation system would bepiloted andlater linked to IDSP system.&#13;
        Information technology tools andtelecommunication services would be used for&#13;
        information flow, data analysis and feedback. Since quick and effective communication&#13;
        i s the key for success o f AI prevention, it i s proposedto use the country wide network&#13;
       which has appropriate bandwidth. This network to be financed under IDSP will be&#13;
        utilized for data transmission, training andteleconferencing.&#13;
&#13;
        A 1.3 Strengthening Capacity for RapidResponse: The 6-day training program o fDistrict&#13;
        andState Surveillance Teams would besuitably modified to include Avian Influenza.&#13;
        Training o fmedical officers, laboratorytechnicians andhealthworkers would also&#13;
        include topics on Avian Influenza. Specific training program for laboratorypersonnel&#13;
       handlingsamples o fsuspected caseswould also focus onbio-safety issues. One round o f&#13;
       training for Rapid Response Teams (RRTs) i s already covered with support from WHO&#13;
        andIDSP.The secondround sensitization trainings for state levelRRTs are plannedin&#13;
       the project. This will involve training around 100professionals in4 batches. Inaddition,&#13;
        special trainings will also be provided for two L4 laboratory staff included inthe network&#13;
        (both 10 laboratories supported under the project and 5 ICMR labs) covering aspects such&#13;
        as use o fPolymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing, biomedical waste management,&#13;
        external quality assuranceprotocols and specimen transfer. Similarly, training will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        provided for all 30 sentinel sites proposed to be included for flu surveillance (2 sites per&#13;
         each L4 lab) covering aspects such as specimen collection andtransfer. BothNICD and&#13;
        National Institute o fVirology will be offering these trainings programs for respective&#13;
         states attached to them. The existingprotocols for acute respiratory triage andreferral&#13;
        will be updated andincorporatedinthe training o fhospital staff.&#13;
&#13;
11Improving access to anti viral drugs and emergency medical care: Improving access to&#13;
antiviral drugs and emergency medical care i s a part o f strengthening o f the health system. GO1&#13;
i s financing this component through domestic budget.&#13;
&#13;
         A II.1 Anti-Viral Drugtherapy andvaccination policy: Use o fanti-viraldrugs willbe&#13;
         integral part o f containment. GO1has stockpiled anti-viral drugs following WHO&#13;
         guidelines for targeted population. Safeguards would be inplace to prevent inappropriate&#13;
         use o f drugs. Guidelines would be published and disseminated on DrugTherapy andwill&#13;
         be usedto train physicians, nursingstaff and other personnel. Current National policy on&#13;
         Immunization has not included regular seasonal influenza vaccination. However, the&#13;
         proposedinfluenza surveillance will help Indiato evolve appropriate policy suitable for&#13;
         the country's needs.&#13;
&#13;
         A 11.2Medical Services: The GO1is also financing inputsto strengthen capacities o f&#13;
         selected medical facilities for optimal services inthe event o f a pandemic. This&#13;
         component would support essential facilities for management o f cases, drugs, vaccines&#13;
         andother medicalinputs.&#13;
&#13;
B. AnimalHealth&#13;
&#13;
34.      HPAIrelated investments for animal healthunder India's Country Program for&#13;
Preparedness, Control and Containment o fAvian Influenzahave been divided into two&#13;
categories, including: (i)   strengthening disease monitoring and surveillance; and (ii) and&#13;
                                                                                        control&#13;
containment. Project support for animal healthrelated activities under India's country program&#13;
i s organized along these lines, with a primary focus on monitoring and surveillance.&#13;
&#13;
B.I. Strengthening Disease Monitoring and Surveillance: Proposed monitoring and surveillance&#13;
related investments under India's Country Program are consistent with the principles defined in&#13;
OIE guide lines for Surveillance o f Avian Influenza: Appendix 3.8.9: Article 3.8.9.1,3.8.9.2 and&#13;
3.8.9.3. They also follow guidelines anddirections as formulated under the Bank supported&#13;
Global Programon Avian Influenza, which emphasizes the need for: (i)         improving animal&#13;
health information flow among relevant agencies; (ii)    detection, reporting and follow-up o f&#13;
reported cases; (iii) public and community-based surveillance networks; (iv) routine serological&#13;
surveys and epidemic-surveillance; and (v) improving diagnostic laboratory capacity. Project&#13;
support for strengthening disease monitoring andsurveillance is particularly geared towards: (i)&#13;
refiningthe resolutiono fthe surveillance system with the aimto detect possibleAIoutbreaks as&#13;
closest as possible to the source; and (ii) strengthening laboratory diagnostic capacity with the&#13;
aim to minimize required time to confirm suspected AI outbreaks.&#13;
&#13;
35.      As far as refining the resolutiono fthe surveillance system is concerned, the Projectwill&#13;
support a number o f activities andinitiatives, including: (i) training o f 70,000 animal health&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
professionals and4,000 wildlife technicians to carry out random surveillance; (ii)      establishment&#13;
o f a participatory disease intelligence constituencybyproviding training to a total o f 120,000&#13;
community representatives aimed at increasing capacity on the ground to detect symptoms o f&#13;
HPAIandother diseases indomestic poultry; (iii) o f satellite mapping o fbird&#13;
                                                       roll-out&#13;
sanctuaries, water-bodies andwet lands; (iv) establishment o f GIs-based animal disease&#13;
surveillance andinformation system as a tool to manage the massive random sero-surveillance&#13;
program effectively; and (v) deployment o f ELISA kits for anti-body detection inthe field,&#13;
thereby reducing the massive flow o f samples sent for testing inthe respective laboratories.&#13;
&#13;
36.     As far as strengthening laboratorydiagnostic capacityis concerned, the Project will&#13;
support: (i)  upgrading o f six central andregional disease diagnostic laboratories to BSL3&#13;
laboratories; (ii)upgrading o f 23 statehniversity laboratories to BSL2 laboratories; and (iii)&#13;
establishment o f one new BSL4laboratory. This would be coupled with effective networking o f&#13;
laboratories and realignment o fthe responsibilities o f the national laboratory network for&#13;
diagnosis and active surveillance by decentralizing certain laboratory functions, especially as far&#13;
as sero-monitoring o f serum samples from wild birdsand domestic poultry is concerned. This&#13;
strategy would be combinedwith plans to establish an additional BSL4 laboratory so that the&#13;
workloads on the existingBSL4 laboratory are rationalized andthe time for reporting after the&#13;
receipt o f the suspect material i s reduced. For this purpose minimumcapacity for undertaking&#13;
various activities related to HPAIdiagnosis for various levels o f laboratories inthe national&#13;
network have been worked out (see Annex for details).&#13;
&#13;
B.II HPAI Outbreak Control and Containment: India's containment andcontrol strategy for&#13;
HPAIoutbreaks indomestic poultry follows OIE/ FA0Guidelines andwas formulated withthe&#13;
active participation o fthe FA0 Country Office inNew Delhi. The DADF, Ministryo f&#13;
Agriculture, Government o f Indiahas issued these guidelines to the State Governments andthe&#13;
State Departments o f Animal Husbandryto set-up their own control and containment&#13;
arrangements inline with these guidelines. The Project would specifically provide support in&#13;
two areas: (i) o f rapidresponse teams; and (ii)&#13;
               training                                     strategic reserves o f equipment. As far as&#13;
training o frapid response teams i s concerned, it i s envisaged that each district will have one such&#13;
team. Each team would consist o f 32 vaccinators, 58 cullers, 14 foggers and 100 local&#13;
administration personnel including veterinary professional andpara-vets, totaling 204 persons&#13;
perteam. With 602 districts inthe country, training would involve a total o fabout 123,000&#13;
people. The provision o f strategic reserves o f equipment would include PPE, fogging machines&#13;
andvaccination equipment andwould bemaintainedat a level to control upto 30 outbreaks/year.&#13;
&#13;
B 111Vaccinationfor birds and compensationfor culling: Although included inIndia's Country&#13;
Program, the Project would not provide support for vaccinations o fbirds and compensation&#13;
payments for culled birds. Infact, despite the provisions inthe Program to vaccinate poultry in&#13;
3-10 kmradius from the source o fthe outbreak, vaccination o fpoultry as a control intervention&#13;
has not yet been deployed by Indianauthorities. Instead, culling o fbirds has been carried out in&#13;
a radius o f 10rather than 3 kmas originally envisaged. As far as compensation i s concerned,&#13;
rates have been fixed at market levels prior to the outbreak (Rs.40/adult bird; Rs.30hroiler;&#13;
Rs.lO/chick&lt;lO weeks) with backyard farmers being paid on the spot and commercial farmers&#13;
after completion o f cleaning-up activities. This system has worked well without major&#13;
complaints. Giventhe large number o frelatively small payments andinview o f readily&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
available resources for this purpose at the State levels, it i s considered that involvement o f the&#13;
Project inthis particular aspect o f India's Programwould not generate sufficient value-added.&#13;
&#13;
C. PublicAwareness andCoordinationSupport&#13;
&#13;
37.     C.IPublic Awareness: This component aims at promoting public awareness, particularly&#13;
orientedtowards high-riskgroups like animal health workers, poultryworkers, live birdmarkets,&#13;
poultry meat handlers, laboratory personnel etc. Support would be provided for the development&#13;
o f communication strategies, development ofprototype materials through various media and&#13;
disseminationcosts. Sensitizationworkshops for various stakeholders would also be undertaken&#13;
under the project.&#13;
&#13;
38.     The Information, Education, Communication (EC) program is to be planned and&#13;
mountedjointly by all the stake holder ministries / departments. Incollaborationwith UNICEF&#13;
andWHO, the DADFandMOH&amp;FW have developed aplanfor strategic communication. The&#13;
overarching objective o f this strategy i s to prevent spread o f avian flu from animals to humans.&#13;
Focused communication approaches and capacity buildinginitiatives are plannedparticularly&#13;
targeting families engagedinbackyardpoultry farming. By developing a composite strategy for&#13;
both animal and humaninfluenza, GO1aims to address all key aspects o fprevention,&#13;
preparedness and systematic response across the country. Inaddition to the Bank project,&#13;
UNICEF, WHO andother UNagencies will support GO1to implement an extensive campaign&#13;
and intensive outreach initiatives to achieve the desired behavior change incommunities.&#13;
Specifically, the communicationwill aim to: (a) Empower families and communities with&#13;
appropriate knowledge and skills on safe healthy and hygiene behaviors and how to protect&#13;
themselves and their children from bird flu and its consequences through appropriate social&#13;
distancingmeasures; (b) Support the communication response and skills o f front line workers&#13;
such as veterinary extension workers, accredited social health activists, anganwadi workers,&#13;
auxiliary nurse midwifes, teachers and doctors; (c) Ensureconsistent political and social&#13;
commitment at state, district andvillage levels through effective advocacy and supporting&#13;
partnerships withpoultry industry,international organizations and other government&#13;
departments, especially ministryo f environment andforests,&#13;
&#13;
39.     C.IICoordination Support: As far as public healthrelatedaspects o f support to India's&#13;
Country Program Preparedness, Control and Containment o fAvian Influenza are concerned, the&#13;
Project would continue to provide support to the Central Surveillance Unit inthe Ministry o f&#13;
Health and FamilyWelfare. As far as the animal health aspects are concerned, the Project would&#13;
support the establishment o f a Bird FluCell inDADF. Boththe Central Surveillance Unit and&#13;
BirdFluCellwould coordinate closelywith the Joint Monitoring Group onAvianInfluenza and&#13;
work closely with the respective State committees for the purposes o f Project implementation.&#13;
They would also take charge o fM&amp;Earrangements andtake the leadon a number o fHPAI-&#13;
related policy and strategic issues that have been identified following the recent outbreak inIndia&#13;
(see Lessons Learnedfor details).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   4. LESSONS      LEARNEDAND REFLECTEDINTHE PROJECTDESIGN&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
40.     Inview ofaccumulated experience over the last few months followingthe HPAI&#13;
outbreaks inMaharashtra, Gujarat andMadhya Pradesh, a number o f issues have emerged that&#13;
call for renewed emphasis or inclusion o f additional items inIndia's Country Program for&#13;
Preparedness, Control and Containment o fAvian Influenza. These issues were identified and&#13;
discussed as part o fthe recently completed ThirdIDSP Review Mission and subsequently&#13;
communicatedto the GO1on June 7,2006. They include:&#13;
(a)   The origin and spread o f the virus are yet to be known, which implies that surveillance&#13;
        efforts are inessence chasing a black box. There i s a need to conduct an epidemiological&#13;
        survey, including sending o f selected samples to regional network laboratories and to&#13;
        OIE/FAO reference laboratory for sharingo ftest results.&#13;
(b)   Upuntilnow outbreaks havebeenpicked-up following suspicious deaths o frelativelylarge&#13;
        number o fbirds, thereby suggesting that a more refined surveillance system would be&#13;
        requiredto pick up signals o fpossible outbreaks at a much earlier stage. Proposals to&#13;
        more systematically involve communities, deploy surveillance o f migratory birds and&#13;
        domestic poultry existing along water bodies, and establish an animal disease&#13;
        surveillance information system therefore need to be pursuedwith utmost urgency.&#13;
(c)   The capacity o f HighSecurity Animal Diagnostic Laboratory, Bhopal has turnedout to be&#13;
        a critical constraint resulting inrelatively long leadtimes before test results become&#13;
        available andoutbreaks can be formally confirmed (see figure below). Inorder to deal&#13;
        with this situation, there is animmediateneedto involve more laboratories at regional&#13;
        andstate levels to undertake preliminarytests /or to empower field teams with test kits&#13;
        for basic screening purposes. Recent experience clearly demonstrates that the proposed&#13;
        laboratory upgrading efforts are a centerpiece o f India's Country Program for&#13;
        Preparedness, Control and Containment, but besides upgrading at the regional level&#13;
        improvements inexisting BSL2 laboratories may berequired.&#13;

&#13;
(d)    The recent outbreak has clearly put the spotlight on the rather poor bio-security conditions&#13;
          that prevail on poultry farms inthe outbreak areas andpossibly elsewhere. Surveillance&#13;
          andcontrol efforts inthe absenceo fadequate compliancewithminimumbio-security&#13;
          measures would be ineffective. There is a need for a carrot-and-stick approach that&#13;
          would encourage self-regulatory mechanisms amongprivate sector to improve on-farm&#13;
          bio-security.&#13;
(e)    There i s a need to have a closer look at institutional arrangements. Inthis context, it&#13;
          appears that effective control o fH5N1 cannot be the responsibility o f the government&#13;
          alone andthat systematic involvement o fthe private industry andpartnershipwith the&#13;
          community through local self government with responsibility for all stakeholders will be&#13;
          crucial. The envisaged update of the contingency plans could be seen as an opportunity&#13;
          to define inmore detail the division o fresponsibilities andcontributions amongthe&#13;
          government, private sector andcommunities inHPAIpreparedness, control and&#13;
          containment. Likewise, coordination at the state level betweenthe Public Health&#13;
          Departments andAnimal HusbandryDepartments is quite intense when an outbreak&#13;
          occurs, but appears to level o f fwhen the immediatethreat i s brought under control. In&#13;
          this respect, there is aneedto ensuremore systematic coordination and communication at&#13;
          the state and district levels betweenthe two departments, possiblythrough includingthe&#13;
          AH department insurveillance committees anddefiningjoint responsibilities for&#13;
          improving on-farm bio-security. Communication through regular information exchange&#13;
          should be ongoing including times when there are no outbreaks.&#13;
( f )  One o fthe strategies is to minimize the opportunities for humaninfections. This is&#13;
          proposed to be done through adoption o f social distancingmeasures, risk identification&#13;
          andmanagement andrisk communication. This is animportant strategy which would&#13;
          require partnershipswith private sector, communities and other important stakeholders.&#13;
          The different segments have to develop anownership for success inthe program. An&#13;
          appropriate strategy would require consultations with stakeholders andtheir involvement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        rightfromthe planningstage. The strategy shouldbe elaboratedwith specific budgetand&#13;
        identified gaps.&#13;
(g)  Surveillance has to be very strong and effective to contain or delay the spread o fthe&#13;
        epidemic at source. The model for seasonal influenza surveillance should consider&#13;
        sentinel surveillance, and involvement o fhospitals insurveillance since they are likely to&#13;
        get a large load o f cases andhave the capacity for collection o f samples andtransporting&#13;
        them. Some o fthe hospitals canperform serological screening. Current efforts in&#13;
        surveillance comprising o f house to house visits are very labor intensive. Various options&#13;
        needto be considered so that the workforce deployedis not overstretched and at the same&#13;
        time the quality i s not compromised. This component is a necessary input into the&#13;
        proposed information technology proposal.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
C.      IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
    1. PARTNERSHIPARRANGEMENTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
41.     The international community and the World Bank can play a key role inthe response to&#13;
AI, especially at the country level where there is a needto develop anoverall framework to guide&#13;
national actionplans that can be the basis for government anddonor support. Such a framework&#13;
should address both animal andpublic health aspects as well as economic impact. The overall&#13;
design o f the Project has been formulated with direct input from FA0 and WHO staff based in&#13;
Delhi, India. Inputsfrom the USAgency for International Development (USAID) assessments&#13;
andtechnical assistancevisits have also helpedto form the overall program.&#13;
42.     Indiais receiving support on the technical content o fan Avian Influenzaresponse from&#13;
key technical agencies -- WHO for public health andFAO/OIE for animal health. For example,&#13;
FA0has aregionalTechnical CooperationPrograms (TCPs) inthe SouthAsia Region, inwhich&#13;
Indiaparticipates. The program's primary objective i s to strengthen the capacity for generating&#13;
andsharing HPAIdiseaseintelligenceand emergency preparedness planning. The program's&#13;
interactionwith Indiawill, among other activities, target improved knowledge o fmigratory&#13;
birds' role inHPAItransmission, strengthened laboratory capacity for HPAIdiagnosis, and&#13;
support for hrther refining o f India's Program for Preparedness, Control and Containment o f&#13;
Avian Influenza. Technical support for humancomponent will beprovidedbyWHO.&#13;

HumanHealthComponent andPublic Awareness&#13;
&#13;
46.     The existing implementation arrangements for IDSPwill continue for the humanhealth&#13;
component.&#13;
&#13;
Animal Husbandry Component&#13;
&#13;
47.     Implementation of proposedanimal healthrelated activities under the Country Program&#13;
for Preparedness, Control and Containment o fAvian Influenzawould be coordinated by a&#13;
dedicatedBirdFluCell inDADFunder the overall guidance o fthe Joint Secretary of Animal&#13;
Husbandry,Dairying andFisheries andwith appropriatelinkages to established&#13;
CommitteedTask ForcedExpert Groups under the Country Programbothat the national and&#13;
state level. The BirdFluCellwould be composed o ftechnical experts as well as financial&#13;
managementandprocurement officers, with qualifications acceptableto the Bank, inorder to&#13;
effectively deal with the entire range of operational aspects associatedwith Program&#13;
implementation. The BirdFluCell would integrate appropriate M&amp;E expertiseinorder to allow&#13;
for effective specification of outcomes on the ground, bothinquantitative and qualitative terms&#13;
on the basis of agreedoutcome and intermediate indicators. Inaddition there could be aneed for&#13;
short term support (accounts personnel) to the regional laboratories for acting as implementing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 17&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
units for all the State level activities such as training and civil works. Inorder to establish the&#13;
BirdFluCellwithin a short periodo ftime, DADFhas indicatedthat itwouldhire contractual&#13;
staff at prevailing marketrates.&#13;

    3. MONITORINGEVALUATION OUTCOMES/RESULTS&#13;
                         AND                OF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
48.      Monitoring: Support would beprovided to enable project monitoring and impact&#13;
evaluation assessments. Two types of M&amp;E are envisaged. First, the CSU inMOHFW andthe&#13;
BirdFluCell inDADFwould collect relevant data from their ministries andother&#13;
implementation agencies and then compile them into semi-annual progress reports focusing on&#13;
output indicators and the status o f physical implementationby component and use o fproject&#13;
funds. For some output indicators, specific surveys will needto be conducted to obtain data for&#13;
this purpose. These would be financed by the Project. As for the financial reports (noted above),&#13;
the CSUwould be responsible for consolidating the ministerial progress reports into an&#13;
integrated project monitoring report.&#13;
49.      Impact evaluationreports: The aim o f evaluation is to find out whether the interventions&#13;
are effective or the program i s having the desired impact. The evaluationwill include both&#13;
quantitative and qualitative aspects. It would be done after two years and at the end o f the&#13;
Project usinga combination o fpopulation and facility based assessment using independent&#13;
evaluators. The quantitative aspects will rely on new Project information systems and surveys&#13;
implementedas parto fthe various components o fthe project, currently existing data sources,&#13;
andprimaryevaluativedata collection efforts. The goal o fthe qualitative aspect o fthe&#13;
evaluationwill be to document perceptions o fprogrammanagers, staff, patients, and local and&#13;
national leaders. Qualitative information will be collected usingsite-visit interviews, focus&#13;
groups, and respondent surveys.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    4. SUSTAINABILITY, CRITICAL RISKS AND POSSIBLECONTROVERSIAL ASPECTS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
50.      Sustainability Critical to the sustainability o fthe Project would be the continuous&#13;
ownership o fthis initiative by the various stakeholders, coupled with strong political support and&#13;
the availability o fan adequate flow o f financial resources to carry out project activities. In&#13;
addition, institutional sustainabilitywould be ensured by: (i)     strengtheningo fprograms to&#13;
maintainpublic awareness o fthe threat of avian influenza and other rapidly spreading infectious&#13;
diseases; (ii) sustained surveillance and prevention and control activities, particularly inhighrisk&#13;
regions; (iii) strengthened country capacity to manage at national and local levels the risk factors&#13;
associated with the spread o f avian influenza and other infectious diseases; and (iv) effectiveness&#13;
o fprograms to control the spread o f avian influenza from birds to the general population.&#13;

immediate responses to an influenza pandemic -- the classic "social distancing measures"-- such&#13;
as quarantine, bans on mass gatherings, andtravel restrictions that may be politically sensitive&#13;
andsocially controversial. This means that dialogue andcompromises are needed among&#13;
different stakeholders, backedby a well-designed communication strategy. A highdegree o f&#13;
political commitment to preventing and controlling the spread o f infectious diseases such as an&#13;
influenza pandemic would beneeded for managing controversies that will undoubtedly arise.&#13;

D.APPRAISAL SUMMARY&#13;
&#13;
    1. ECONOMIC FINANCIALANALYSES&#13;
                      AND&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
52.    InIndiathe value ofoutputfrompoultry sector was nearlyUS$3billionin2004-05, and&#13;
the sector provides direct andindirect employment to over 3 millionpeople. The sector has been&#13;
growing at a rate o f 10% to 15% annually for the last few years.&#13;
&#13;
53.    Onthe trade front, poultry exports from Indiacurrently form a miniscule portion (US$ 80&#13;
million only) o f its total poultry production. The avian influenza epidemic has come at a time&#13;
when India was eyeing a muchhigher export o fpoultry after the IndianCommerce Minister&#13;
succeeded inpersuading Japan to allow exports o f frozen chicken from India. With Japan&#13;
accepting the certification andimporting chicken, India hadbeen hoping to make inroads into&#13;
other countries as well.&#13;
&#13;
54.    Other stylized facts o f Indianpoultry industry are:&#13;
&#13;
    0  Indianpoultry industryhas two mainoutputs: eggs andpoultry meat. Indiaproduced41&#13;
       billion eggs and 1.84 billion kg o fmeat in2004-05. Indianpoultry industryhas 1.87&#13;
       billion poultry birds (1.7 billionboiler birds used for meat and 170million layer birds&#13;
       used for producing eggs duringtheir reproductive period).&#13;
    0  The overall domestic consumption o f eggs andpoultry meat inIndiai s still low&#13;
       especially inrural areas where around 70% o f the population lives.&#13;
    0  About 70% o f the poultry industry inIndia i s inthe organized sector andthe rest inthe&#13;
       informal sector. However, growth o f organizedpoultry industry is largely inthe western&#13;
       andsouthern regions o fIndia. Only a few farms havebeenable to achieve international&#13;
       standardsfor producing poultrymeat. This limitsIndia's ability to meet increasing&#13;
       international demand for processed poultry meat.&#13;
    0  Indianpoultry meat marketis dominatedbylive birdsales. Around 95% o ftotal demand&#13;
       for poultrymeat is interms o f live birds; only 5% o fpoultry meat i s actually processed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  20&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       Because o fthis feature o f Indianpoultry meat market, there is a real danger o f the avian&#13;
        flu spreading to different locationsunless strong measures aretakento containit.&#13;
&#13;
55.    An epidemic o fbirdfluwould cause large economic lossesto the poultry industry. When&#13;
demand for poultry abruptly shrinks due to a birdflu scare, price tends to come down. Price&#13;
declines are given an additional pushbecause farmers andtraders (especially those inclose&#13;
proximityto the affected regions) try to sell their stocks at reducedmargins rather than risk the&#13;
disease hittingtheir farms. Once the existing stocks are sold, new production o fpoultry slows&#13;
down. Thus the value o f output inthe poultry industrydeclines because o fboth lower prices and&#13;
lower quantitiesproduced and sold.&#13;
&#13;
56.     Inaddition, economic losseswould also occur inother industriesthat either provide&#13;
inputsto the poultry industry, such as producers o fbirdfeed, or are "downstream" from the&#13;
poultry industry, such as transportation andmarketingup to the point where the product reaches&#13;
the consumer. There may also be negative spillovers into the tourism industry.&#13;
&#13;
57.     Furthermore, ifthe epidemic expands into the humanpopulation, society would suffer&#13;
further losses interms o fmedical costs, lost earnings and o f course lives.&#13;
&#13;
58.     Estimatingthe monetary value o f these various categories o f losses inthe case o f a&#13;
hypothetical epidemic requires a number o f assumptions. And, inorder to estimate the economic&#13;
benefits arising from the plannedinterventions, assumptions also need to be made concerning&#13;
how mucho f a difference these interventions would make interms o freducing losses to society.&#13;
&#13;
59.     For this Technical Annex, some illustrative calculations o f losses averted on account o f&#13;
the plannedinterventionshavebeenmade. Details are giveninAnnex. Under conservative&#13;
assumptions, the estimated averted loss from implementing an effective strategy against Avian&#13;
Influenza i s about US$1.9 billion. This estimate corresponds to a single episode o f avian&#13;
influenza epidemic lasting between 18 and 52 weeks. Losses averted would be much higher if&#13;
measured over a longer period o ftime, to the extent that the disease returned periodically.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    2. TECHNICAL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
60.     India's contingency planshave been subject to a rapid assessmentby the Bank, which&#13;
was published inJanuary 2006 (andincluded inthe Project Files). India's Country Program for&#13;
Preparedness, Control and Containment o fAvian Influenza has been endorsed by WHO and&#13;
FAO. Proposed support under IDSPto India's Country Programhasbeendefinedinclose&#13;
consultation with WHO and FAO.&#13;
&#13;
61.    A further analysis o fthe emerging issues as specifiedinthe section on Lessons Learned,&#13;
suggests that the critical factors determining the effectiveness o f India's AI preparedness and&#13;
responsiveness appear to lie particularly inthe upstreamsegments o fthe defined Country&#13;
Program, including: (i)   more refined andprecise surveillance; (ii) laboratory testing&#13;
                                                                      faster&#13;
response times; (iii) improved on-farm bio-security; (iv) better understanding o funderlying&#13;
causes and spread o f the virus; and (v) more effective partnerships with relevant stakeholders. A&#13;
better handleon these factors will enable Indiato increasingly deal with the virus at its source,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
thereby reducing: (i) o fhumaninfections; (ii)&#13;
                       risk                          economic losses inthe poultry sector; and (iii)&#13;
Program implementationcosts due to reduced need for culling with associated compensation&#13;
payments. It i s inline with these considerations that proposedBank support through IDSP has&#13;
been defined.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    3. FIDUCIARY&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
62.     Procurement. The new activities inthe restructured IDSP would include inter alia civil&#13;
works and equipment purchase for up-gradation o f the regional laboratories, development o f&#13;
GIs, andtraining for various departmental staff andDistrict/ BlocWGramPanchayat&#13;
functionaries at the State level. A detailed Procurement Plan, covering the first 18 months o f&#13;
implementationo fthese activities has beenprepared andis presented inAnnex. Procurement for&#13;
AIcomponent shallbeinitiatedusingthe procedures agreedinthe procurementplan.However&#13;
incaseofanyemergency situation, faster procurement methodssuch as Direct Contracting and&#13;
Limited International Bidding(LIB)will be considered provided such request i s received from&#13;
GO1withjustification.&#13;
&#13;
63.     Financial Management: AvianFluproject has two broad components, the Human&#13;
Component andthe Animal Component. The activities under the HumanComponent (which i s&#13;
approx US$ 5 million) include procurement o f equipments andconsumables for 10identified&#13;
institutions across the country, training and strengthening o f information systems. These&#13;
activities including procurement will be centralizedandwill be carried out bythe existing central&#13;
Project Management Unit created for the IDSP, while the training etc will be carried out by&#13;
National Institute o f Communicable Diseases (NICD). The PMUhas necessary finance staffwho&#13;
are familiar with the Bank's financial management requirements.&#13;
&#13;
64.      The Animal health Component will be implemented by the Departments o fAnimal&#13;
Husbandry, Dairying andFisheries (DADF) within the Ministryo fAnimal Husbandry. The&#13;
approx cost o f this component is US$28 million. A separate BirdFluCell will be created within&#13;
the DADFto implement the project. About 80% o fthe expenditures, primarilyprocurement o f&#13;
equipment for strengthening o f 23 labs across the country will be managed centrally by the Bird&#13;
FluCell, while the balance will be implementedbythe 23 identified labs. Thebroadactivities&#13;
underthe project would include civil works andequipment purchase for up-gradationo fthe&#13;
regional laboratories, development o f GIs, IEC andtraining for various staff andDistrict/&#13;
BlocWGram Panchayat functionaries at the State level.&#13;
&#13;
65.      The Bank project will not finance any compensation for culling or procurement o f&#13;
vaccines or honorarium to individuals/ GP for reporting o f outbreaks.&#13;
&#13;
66.     Financial Management Assessment:&#13;
&#13;
    The financial management assessment focused on the DADFwhich is a new implementing&#13;
entity. It was agreed that the BirdFluCell (as a Project Management Unit-PMU) within the&#13;
Dept o fAnimal Husbandrywould be strengthened to include two consultants - one Procurement&#13;
officer andone Finance officer. These would be on contractual basis co-terminus with the project&#13;
implementation. Inaddition there could be a need for short term support (accounts personnel) to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
the regional laboratories for acting as implementingunits for all the State level activities such as&#13;
training and civil works. The settingup a fully functional BirdFluCell including finance staff is&#13;
a legal covenant.&#13;
&#13;
67.     Budget and Funds Flow arrangements: Basedon the proposedimplementation&#13;
arrangements the budget provision would be made (after EFC approval) inthe budget o fDADF&#13;
to facilitate the flow o f funds. The following arrangements were agreed:&#13;
&#13;
68.      Civil Works:this would be required at the 6 regional labs and at the proposednew lab.&#13;
The procurementprocess would be initiatedby the respective regional labs andbased on the&#13;
progress o fworks and submission o fbills bythe regional labs, payment would be made directly&#13;
releasedto the contractors by the BirdFluCell.&#13;
&#13;
69.      Procurement of equipmentd computerdsoftware for GIs This activity would be&#13;
centralized andwill be carried out by the BirdFluCell inorder to achieve efficiencies in&#13;
consolidated procurement. The procured equipments would be delivered to the regional labs.&#13;
&#13;
70.      Training:Funds for training will be advanced (based on approved training plan/&#13;
schedule) to the respective nodal officer at the regional labs who would render accounts to the&#13;
PMUPAO- Pay &amp; Accounts Office. It was confirmed that this is the current practice being&#13;
adopted and that the regional labs would be able to manage this activity across the states inthe&#13;
region.&#13;
&#13;
71.      The above arrangement would ensure that the funds would flow to the implementing&#13;
agencies (labs) quickly, avoid delays inbudget and funds flow constraints at the State treasury&#13;
level and ensure quick renderingo f accounts and financial reports.&#13;
&#13;
72.     Accounting &amp;Audit Arrangements: As activities will be carried out either by the Bird&#13;
FluCell or byway o fadvances to the regional labs (who inturnwill render accounts, including&#13;
bills to the PMUPAO) the accounting function could be centralized inthe BirdFlucell&#13;
(including monitoring o f advances) and the audit o fthe same could be carried out by the CAG.&#13;
The terms o freference for audit consented to bythe C A G for the IDSPwould be extended to the&#13;
Animal Husbandry Component also. Inaddition to the existing audit reports the Bank will&#13;
receive a separate audit report on the Avian Flu- Animal Component o f the project from the&#13;
BirdFlucell. This will bemonitored inARCS. There are no pending audit reports under the on-&#13;
going IDSP.&#13;
&#13;
73.     Financial Reporting &amp; Disbursement Arrangements: The financial reporting (reporting&#13;
format and frequency etc) - six monthly FMRand disbursement as per the traditional re-&#13;
imbursement method based on submission o f statements o f Expenditure will be followed. The&#13;
two PMUs would separately submit reimbursement claims andFMRto the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    4. SOCIAL&#13;
&#13;
74.     No additional social safeguard will be triggered as a result o fthe proposedamendment to&#13;
IDSP for the purposes o f support to India's Country Program for Preparedness, Control and&#13;
Containment o f Avian Influenza. However, incase o f outbreaks, the impact o f the mandatory&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  23&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
culling o fpoultry andthe consequent threat to livelihoods needs to be mitigated. For this&#13;
purpose, a number o fmeasures has been and/or are being put inplace by GO1andReserve Bank&#13;
o f India to deal with the financial fall-out, including: (i)&#13;
                                                            compensation o f Rs. 40 per culled bird&#13;
paid to affected farmers, which i s closely inline with on-going market rates prior to the first&#13;
reportedoutbreak; (ii)   although originally not envisaged inthe Contingency Plans, compensation&#13;
is beingconsidered for other destroyed items, including eggs and feed; (iii)    grantingo f a one-&#13;
time reductiono f four percentage points inthe interest payment liability on the bank loans o f all&#13;
types taken bypoultry farmers; (iv) a moratorium o f one year on payment o fprincipal and&#13;
interest; (v) conversiono f working capital into term loanpayable over three years; (vi)&#13;
rescheduling o fterm loans availedbypoultry farmers over an additional period o ftwo years&#13;
from the agreedtenor o f the term loan; and (vii) permissionto draw additional working capital&#13;
after conversion o fworking capital into term loan. These measures will provide the social&#13;
safeguards and are likely to enhance participation o f the communities inthe control efforts. In&#13;
order to be able to detect HPAIoutbreaks as closely to the source as possible, thereby preventing&#13;
the spread o f the virus and consequently reduce associated financial losses, it i s foreseen under&#13;
India's country program to include village representatives insurveillance efforts, who will be&#13;
paid a premiumfor each detected and confirmed case o fHPAIinfection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     5. ENVIRONMENT&#13;
&#13;
75.     The existing Environmental Management Plano f IDSP is generally adequate given the&#13;
envisaged new activities to support to India's Country Program for Preparedness, Control and&#13;
Containment o f Avian Influenza. Inaddition, the Technical Annexes for Animal Healthrelated&#13;
activities under the program (as included inthe Project Files) are quite comprehensive and&#13;
clearly: (i) requiredbio-safety measures; (ii) various categories o fwaste andtheir&#13;
             detail                                    specify&#13;
management, including water quality issues; and (iii)     cover sanitation, Personal prophylaxis&#13;
Equipment, as well as arrangements for the healthandsafety o fworkers. Inview o f envisaged&#13;
laboratory construction and up-gradation activities, the EMPwill be updated andcontractual&#13;
documents will contain provisions to deal with the management o f construction waste in&#13;
accordance with Bank procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     6. SAFEGUARDPOLICIES&#13;
&#13;
76.     The proposed amendment o f IDSP for the purpose o fHPAI-related activities does not&#13;
trigger additional safeguard policies beyond the existing ones, including Environmental&#13;
Assessment andIndigenous Peoples.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     7. POLICY EXCEPTIONS READINESS&#13;
                                AND&#13;
&#13;
77.     The proposed amendment o f IDSP for the purposes o fHPAI-related activities does not&#13;
seek any policy exceptions.&#13;
&#13;
E.FINANCIAL TERMSAND CONDITIONS.&#13;
&#13;
78.     The proposed amendment o f IDSP for the purposes o fHPAI-related activities does not&#13;
alter the financial terms and conditions o f on-going Bank support for IDSP.&#13;

IndiaAvian InfluenzaPandemicPreparednessPlan&#13;
&#13;
Government o f Indiahas prepared a comprehensive planto prevent andcontain Avian Influenza&#13;
inthe country. The Planis beingupdatedbasedonimplementationexperiences ofcontrolling&#13;
AvianInfluenzaoutbreaks inpoultry sector inthree States(Maharashtra, Gujarat andMadhya&#13;
Pradesh) inIndia.&#13;
&#13;
A highlevel steering committee hasbeen set upto take decisions oninterventions inemergency&#13;
situations. It would also monitor activities taken inthe event o f outbreaks. A co-ordination&#13;
committee has been set up with representation from Departments o f Health &amp; Department o f&#13;
Animal Husbandry andother stakeholders to ensure integration and coordination o f various&#13;
activities under the Project. A joint monitoring group was established with Director General o f&#13;
Health Services as its chairperson inJanuary 2004. Similar mechanisms have been established&#13;
indifferent statesofthe country. A number oflegal, policy andregulationissuesthat are&#13;
relevant to the effective containment o f avian influenza will be addressed. These issues include&#13;
notification o f the disease inanimals andhumans, bio security measures andbio safety norms in&#13;
the organized, unorganized sectors, market places, healthinstitutions andback yardpoultry.&#13;
These also include compensation policy, compartmentalization and zoning, andregulatory&#13;
aspects relating to drugs, andvaccines. Provisions have also been made inthe contingency plans&#13;
to establish crisis management committee under Secretary Health andFamily Welfare, National,&#13;
state, district influenza pandemic committee andjoint monitoring groups at all levels. The plan&#13;
recognizes the need for coordination betweenthe Ministry o f Health and Department o f Animal&#13;
Husbandry. Others like the representative from the ministryo f environment and forestry,&#13;
ministryo fhome etc are co opted as members whenrequired.&#13;

Control and Containment of Avian Influenza, will be divided into three parts, including: (a);&#13;
humanhealth (b) animalhealth; and(c) public awareness andcoordinationsupport.&#13;
&#13;
A. HumanHealth&#13;
&#13;
The country plan for control and containment o f Avian influenza on the human side aims at (1)&#13;
reducing the morbidity and mortality due to influenza and (2) decrease the social disruption and&#13;
economic losses.&#13;
&#13;
World Health Organization in2005 has reviewed the classification system prepared in 1999 for&#13;
phasingvarious stages o f the pandemic development/progress. The same has been adopted by&#13;
Govt. o f India for harmonization o f classification, for delineating the activities, roles and&#13;
responsibilities.&#13;

TheIndia-Integrated Disease Surveillance Project&#13;
&#13;
Indiahas launchedthe IntegratedDisease SurveillanceProject (IDSP) with support from the&#13;
World Bank inNovember 2004. This project aims to improve information available to the&#13;
government health services andprivate healthcare providers on a set o fhigh-priority diseases&#13;
andrisk factors, with a view to improving the on-the-groundresponses to such diseases andrisk&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 34&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
factors. The project will be covering all the states and Union Territories (UTs) ina phased&#13;
mannerby 2009 with total cost o fRs. 4083.6 million. Itplans to establish disease surveillance&#13;
units at the central, state and district levels, train RRT to detect andrespondto outbreaks,&#13;
strengthen laboratories and use information technology for communication and data analysis.&#13;
This infrastructureis proposed to beutilized for disease surveillance o fhumanAvianinfluenza&#13;
also.&#13;
&#13;
The Project addressescommon communicable diseases and risk factors o f non-communicable&#13;
diseases. Followingdiseases o fpublic health importance are included for support under the&#13;

&#13;
    (iv) State Specific Diseases (Not exceeding five ina State)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Under the "Unusual Clinical Syndromes" diseases like SARS andAvian Influenzacan be&#13;
covered. This issue was reiteratedduringthe negotiationswith the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
The proposalto utilize the infrastructure for the responseto the threat posedby AI fits well with&#13;
the overall objectives o f IDSP. It i s proposedto minimize the threat posedto humans byHPAIas&#13;
a part o fpreparationfor the prevention, control andresponse to influenzapandemic. It is an&#13;
opportunity for the strengthening o f sectoral coordination inaddressing zoonotic diseases, which&#13;
are posing, new and increasingchallenges duringthe 21St century. Through the strengthening o f&#13;
laboratory services, use o f information technology, revamping o f surveillance andhuman&#13;
resource development, it i s proposedto address the problem o ftransmission o f AI to humans.&#13;
The problem o f seasonal influenza will also be addressedthus contributing to the inputs into&#13;
influenza pandemic preparedness andresponse. The proposedstrengthening o f laboratory&#13;
networks will be very usehl ininvestigating other viral syndromes andunusual outbreaks.&#13;
&#13;

Projectcomponents&#13;
&#13;
ComponentA: Humanhealth&#13;
&#13;
The overall scope o fthe humanhealth component (additional to existing IDSP) will include (i)&#13;
Strengthening o f Public Health Surveillance including rapid response (ii)  improving access to&#13;
antiviral drugs andemergency medical care. Out o fthese Strengthening o fPublic Health&#13;
Surveillance will be financed by the Bank through IDSP as it fits inthe project's development&#13;
objectives and GO1will be financing the remaining objectives.&#13;
&#13;
A.l Strengthening PublicHealthSurveillanceandLaboratoryCapacity&#13;
&#13;
Standardcase definitions for suspected, probable and confirmed case o fAvianInfluenza in&#13;
conformity with WHO recommendations have been developed and would be adopted to ensure&#13;
uniformity across the country (See attachment for case definition). Formats designed for IDSP&#13;
would be used and suitably modified, wherever required for surveillance. Incase o f confirmed&#13;
cases inpoultry, active screening o f exposed and at-risk populationwould be carried out for&#13;
required duration. For routine surveillance, new diseases like AI are covered under "Unusual&#13;
Clinical Syndromes". When there are confirmed outbreaks inpoultry, active surveillance among&#13;
those who are exposed and at risk population i s proposed for a period o f 3 weeks after last&#13;
reportedcase.&#13;
&#13;
A 1.1 Improvementsinthe LaboratoryNetwork&#13;
&#13;
Itis intendedto strengthen laboratory surveillance network for diagnosis o fhumanseasonaland&#13;
avian influenzaandpandemic influenza for effective preventionand control. The overarching&#13;
objective o f this component i s to strengthen capacity o f laboratory network under IDSP for&#13;
diagnosis o f human influenza (seasonal and avian) and pandemic influenza and other emerging&#13;
infectious diseases through laboratory strengthening and human capacity building. Specific&#13;
objectives include:&#13;
&#13;
        To develop andimplement a rapid and safe specimen transport policy and strengthen&#13;
        laboratory communication&#13;
        To strengthen the validity o flaboratory results by establishing a practical and feasible&#13;
        quality assurance system within the framework o f IDSP laboratorynetwork&#13;
        To develop andoperationalize a functional laboratory surveillance network at the&#13;
        peripheral, intermediate, regional, national and international level through exchange and&#13;
        sharingo finformation andclinical material&#13;
        To ensure availability o f reliable and comprehensive laboratory surveillance data through&#13;
        establishing a soundlaboratory specimen anddata management system for critical&#13;

Itisproposedto havetwo L5 and 10L4laboratories operationalby2008.Network o f&#13;
Laboratories andtheir roles are given as an attachment. It is expected that the laboratories inthe&#13;
network will perform real time PCR assays while more advanced diagnostics, including viral&#13;
isolation will be done at NIV and NICD.&#13;
&#13;
The expected roles andresponsibilities o f different laboratories proposedto be included under AI&#13;
surveillance are presented inTechnical Annex G (inproject files).&#13;
&#13;
To ensure intensive surveillance and for higher quality data it i s expected that information on&#13;
influenza like illness will be collected from each selected site (one site ineach state andunion&#13;
territory) on a weekly basis. Specimens will be collected from a systematic sample o f influenza&#13;
like illness patients for investigation. A planwill be developed to systematically analyze and&#13;
disseminate the results derived from the sentinel sites. This would help indecisions regarding the&#13;
use o f seasonal vaccine.&#13;
&#13;
A. 1.2 Health Information&amp; telecommunication&#13;
&#13;
Software for Disease Surveillance is being developed under IDSP. However, it may take a few&#13;
months for it to be fully operational. A rapid information system would be piloted and later&#13;
linked to IDSP system. Information technology tools andtelecommunication services would be&#13;
usedfor information flow, data analysis andfeedback. Since quick andeffective communication&#13;
is the key for success o f AI prevention, it i s proposedto use the country wide network o f Indian&#13;
Space Research Organization (ISRO) which is beingfinanced under IDSP. This network will be&#13;
utilized for data transmission, training andteleconferencing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    37&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
A.1.3 StrengtheningCapacityfor RapidResponse&#13;
&#13;
Inview ofurgent need, RapidResponseTeams were specificallytrained for Avian Influenza.&#13;
The 6-day training program o fDistrict and State Surveillance Teams would be suitably modified&#13;
to include Avian Influenza. Training o f medical officers, laboratory technicians andhealth&#13;
workers would also include topics on Avian Influenza. Specific training program for laboratory&#13;
personnel handlingsamples o f suspected cases would also focus on bio-safety issues. One round&#13;
o ftraining for RapidResponse Teams (RRTs) i s already covered with support from WHO and&#13;
IDSP. The second round sensitization trainings for state level RRTs are plannedunder the&#13;
project. This will involve training around 100professionals in4 batches. Inaddition, special&#13;
trainings will also be provided for L4 laboratory staff included inthe network (both the labs&#13;
supported under the project and 5 ICMR labs) covering aspects such as use o f Polymerase Chain&#13;
Reactiontesting, biomedical waste management, external quality assurance protocols and&#13;
specimen transfer. Similarly, training will be provided for all 30 sentinel sites proposedto be&#13;
included for flu surveillance (2 sites per each L4 lab) covering aspects such as specimen&#13;
collection and transfer. BothNICD andNational Institute o fVirology will be offering these&#13;
trainings programs for respective states attached to them.&#13;
&#13;
A.2. Improvingaccess to anti viral drugs and emergency medical care (to be financed by&#13;
GOI)&#13;
&#13;
A.2.1 Vaccination&#13;
&#13;
Current National policy on Immunization has not included regular seasonal influenza&#13;
vaccination. The development o f a policy on influenza vaccination is a very important part o f the&#13;
contingencypreparedness plans. The surveillance for seasonal influenza i s necessary since&#13;
vaccine for influenza infection is based on the circulating virus strains and the country has to&#13;
develop the capacity to monitor the strains. The proposedinfluenza surveillance will help India&#13;
to evolve appropriate policy suitable for the country's needs.&#13;
&#13;
A.2.2 Anti-ViralDrugtherapy&#13;
&#13;
Use o f anti-viral drugs will be integralpart o f containment. GO1has stockpiled anti-viral drugs&#13;
following WHO guidelines for targeted population. Safeguards would be inplace to prevent&#13;
inappropriate use o f drugs. Guidelines would be published and disseminated on DrugTherapy&#13;
andwillbe usedto train physicians, nursingstaff andother personnel. Current National policy&#13;
on Immunizationhas not included regular seasonal influenza vaccination. However, the&#13;
proposed influenza surveillance will help India to evolve appropriate policy suitable for the&#13;
country's needs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A.2.3 MedicalServices&#13;
&#13;
The GO1is also financing inputs to strengthen capacities o f selected medical facilities for&#13;
optimal services inthe event o f a pandemic. This component would support essential facilities&#13;
for management o f cases, drugs, vaccines and other medical inputs.&#13;

B. 1StrengtheningDiseaseMonitoringand Surveillance&#13;
&#13;
Proposed monitoring and surveillance related investments are consistent with the principles&#13;
defined inOIE guidelines for Surveillance o f Avian Influenza: TerrestrialAnimal Health Code&#13;
2005, Appendix 3.8.9: Article 3.8.9.1, 3.8.9.2 and 3.8.9.3. They also follow guidelines and&#13;
directions as formulated under the Bank supported Global Program on Avian Influenza, which&#13;
emphasizes the need for: (i)   improving animal health information flow among relevant agencies;&#13;
(ii)&#13;
   detection, reporting and follow-up o freported cases; (iii) and community-based&#13;
                                                               public&#13;
surveillance networks; (iv) routine serological surveys and epidemic-surveillance; and (v)&#13;
improving diagnostic laboratory capacity   .&#13;
&#13;
Inlinewiththis, aneightninepoint approachtomonitoringandsurveillance of: (i) ranging, free&#13;

large and small; and (iii)  wild and migratory birds are listedbelow:&#13;
&#13;
1.      Surveillance program for migratory birds backyard poultry around wetlands and along&#13;
        flyways.&#13;
2.      Surveillance program for commercial poultry.&#13;
3.      Satellite mapping o fbird sanctuaries, water bodies andwetland areas.&#13;
4.      Development o f GIS based database on migratory / water birds andtheir habitats.&#13;
5.      Strengthening laboratory infrastructure and field operations for early disease detection.&#13;
6.      Buildingup aparticipatory diseaseintelligenceconstituency o fvillage level animal&#13;
        healthworkers&#13;
7.      Training&#13;
&#13;
B.1.1. Surveillancefor Migratory BirdsandBackyardPoultry aroundWetlands and along&#13;
Flyways&#13;
&#13;
Surveillance activities for migratory birds andbackyard poultry will be organized around some&#13;
200 wetlands, representing important nestinghreeding habitats o fmigratory birds, as well as&#13;
along major flyways. Frequency and duration o f surveillance needs to be fixed at monthly&#13;
intervals for a period o f three years respectively. Focuswill be on detecting unusually high&#13;
mortality. Deployment o f commercial ELISAkits for antibody detectionwill be integratedin&#13;
the surveillance program. State DAH&amp;VS appoint a Special Officer for birdflu surveillance in&#13;
the state with counterparts indistrict veterinary offices.&#13;
&#13;
B.1.2. Surveillance: CommercialPoultryFarmFlocks&#13;
&#13;
Surveillance activities incommercial poultry farm flocks are organizedina manner that takes&#13;
into account the following points, as emphasized and covered inproposed training efforts:&#13;
(a)     HPAISurveillanceprogram inprivate sector poultry industryshouldbe mandatorywith&#13;
        focus on detecting unusually highmortality.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  43&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(b)     Deployment o f commercial ELISA kits for antibody detection will be integratedinthe&#13;
        surveillance program.&#13;
(c)     Inventory o f all RegisteredCommercial Poultry Farms should be included ina state&#13;
        database.&#13;
(d)     Reporting o funusually highmortality should be made mandatory.&#13;
(e)     Sample collection and lab testing should be the prerogative o f the state ELISAD1lab.&#13;
(f)     Birdfluvaccination shouldbebanned inall commercialpoultry farms.&#13;
&#13;
B.1.3. Satellite Mapping o f Bird Sanctuaries, Water Bodies andWetlands&#13;
&#13;
Birdsanctuaries, water bodies andwetland areashaveuniqueBio andEco systems. These are&#13;
usually the most ideal habitats for nesting o fmigratory birds; andthey are invariably longterm&#13;
tenants ina location often spread over centuries, as generations after generations o fmigrating&#13;
flocks tend to returnto the same location for wintering. Association o fbird flu with migratory&#13;
birds adds a new dimension to these habitats interms o f their relevance to national economy as&#13;
well as public health. It has now become important to know which birdspecies bringbirdflu&#13;
andfrom where and also to understand the dynamics o fmigratory birdwintering process as also&#13;
the use o f habitat resources for other economic pursuits. Topography o f habitats such as stagnant&#13;
water, inand out flows, vegetation andnatural / indigenousbirdpopulations inthem etc have to&#13;
be logged andmapped. There is also needto create a national database on birdsanctuaries,&#13;
water bodies and wetlands which are migratory birdhabitats.&#13;
&#13;
Satellite mapping duringpre / early / mid/ late migration into habitats provide nesting density&#13;
andchanges that follow post migration. Spatial andtemporal aspects o fhabitats isbest provided&#13;
by satellite mapping andthey help to create GIS maps, databases andbiodiversity catalogues o f&#13;
migratory birdhabitats. Collaboration will be sought with experts on migratory birds like&#13;
Wetlands International or Zoological Survey of India.&#13;
&#13;
B.1.4. Development o fGISbasedAnimal Disease SurveillanceandInformation System&#13;
&#13;
The DADFcurrently does not have a disease information system other than the manually&#13;
operated disease outbreak reporting and analysis traditionally followed by the AH Departments&#13;
ofthe Central and State Governments. Inorder to work the massive random surveillance&#13;
program under the Program effectively, it i s essential to establish a nation wide, dynamic,&#13;
information systemandnetwork electronically enabled, GIS based and GPS centric. The entire&#13;
animal disease intelligence / information systemusingGIS format depends on satellite imagery&#13;
to a very large extent. The DADFtherefore has to structure a disease surveillance and&#13;
containment program using satellite imagery / GIS Data Systems.&#13;
&#13;
The Network should linkthe Nodal Animal HealthGroup responsible for HPAIControl and&#13;
Containment inthe DADF,the State AH HQs / state HPAIProject Directors, State Level&#13;
Disease InvestigationLaboratories, the 5 RDDLs, andthe CDDL, the four quarantine centres o f&#13;
the DADF,Wild Lifewingo fthe MoF&amp;E, Zoological Survey o fIndia, the BombayNatural&#13;
History Society; andwith the PD-ADMAS as the Epicentre. The Antrix Corporation / ISROi s&#13;
discussing this issue with the DADF and has already provided a proposal for a system involving&#13;
Satellite imagery o fwater bodies andwet lands, mapping o f the landcorridors beneath the major&#13;
fly ways, a GIS based, GPS enabled, animal disease intelligence / information system including&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 44&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
equipping the system and training andrunninginthe system over a three year period. This&#13;
should also include the geospatial location o fpoultry farms, villages with poultryto tract and&#13;
predict the progress o f disease from its origin to develop effective control strategies.&#13;
&#13;
B.1.5. Strengthening LaboratoryInfrastructure for Early Disease Detection&#13;
&#13;
Strengths and weaknessof the existing laboratory system: InIndiathere i s only one BSL 4&#13;
laboratory which is capable o fhandlingthe diagnosis o f Avianinfluenza. Since the declaration&#13;
o fthe first outbreak, a large number o f samples are being sent to this laboratory resulting ina&#13;
back log o f a large numbers o f samples. Consequently, there is delay intesting o f samples,&#13;
which hamper the effectiveness o f control and containment measures on the ground. Though&#13;
there are six regional disease diagnostic laboratories inthe country, these laboratories are not&#13;
able to handle the avian influenza infected samples due to lack o f disease containment facilities.&#13;
&#13;
Strengths o fthe existing system include:&#13;
        Capacity to test exists within the country.&#13;
        Huge infrastructure, including: (i)  26,7 17 veterinary hospitals/polyclinics or dispensaries&#13;
        inthe public andprivate sector, 28,195 veterinary aidcenters, includingmobile&#13;
        dispensaries; (ii) 250 disease diagnostic laboratories; (iii)premier, more than 100year&#13;
                                                                     a&#13;

        (RDDLs)at Pune, Kolakata, Guwahati, Bangalore andJalandhar; and(viii) 33 veterinary&#13;
        institutes, generally at least one ineach state.&#13;
        Availability o fHumanResource/ professionally qualified veterinarians-nearly 30,000&#13;
        veterinarians and 70,000 para-vets employed bythe Government.&#13;

        economic importance.&#13;
        Highlymotivatedactiveprivatepoultry sector - laboratories, pharmaceuticals and&#13;

&#13;
Weaknesses o fthe existing system include:&#13;
(a)     Lack o f functioning network o f disease diagnostic laboratories.&#13;
(b)     Only one disease containment laboratory (HSADL, Bhopal).&#13;
(c)     Six regional disease diagnostic laboratories inthe country, which are not able to handle&#13;
        the avian influenza infected samples due to lack o f disease containment facilities.&#13;
(d)     Lack o ftrained manpower inepidemiology.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  45&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(e)     Nonutilization o fhighlyqualified andtrained humanresources available inthe&#13;
        Veterinary CollegesKJniversities andlack o f systematic linkages with the network o f&#13;
        laboratories (such as veterinary colleges anduniversities).&#13;
( f )   Role o f veterinary institutions andtheir current involvement inpoultry and their current&#13;
        capacity to contribute to implementation o f contingency plans i s unclear.&#13;
(g)     Lack o f information on the specific plans for involvement o f the laboratories at the&#13;
        regional levels andinthe private sector.&#13;
(h)     The details o f system for surveillance are not available.&#13;
(i)     Under-financedpoultry sector andlaboratory system.&#13;
6)      Non availability o f quality diagnostic reagents andkits within the country.&#13;
(k)     Largenumbero fwater bodies and 115 birdsanctuaries inthe country requires the active&#13;
        involvement o fDepartment o f Environment andForests.&#13;
&#13;
Establishment and Management of Avian influenza (AI) diagnosis in the laboratory network,&#13;
HSADL,Bhopal, has a staffstrength of 13 scientists andcanhandleabout 3,000 samples aweek,&#13;
which i s indeed a credible output considering the nature o f RT-PCR tests andpossibly,&#13;
reconfirmation o fresults. This capability i s bound to be inadequate ifthe Avian flu escalates.&#13;
&#13;
To overcome the shortcomings o fthe laboratory testing system andto improve the system, it i s&#13;
necessary to establish an additional BSL4 Laboratory and utilize all the well established&#13;
laboratories by networking them and decentralizing the activities relatedto diagnosis o fHPAI.&#13;
The primary goal o f such network i s to detect and identify newly emergingepidemic variants in&#13;
a timely manner. The goal o f surveillance inbirds i s to complement the humansurveillance&#13;
network, to understand the ecology o f influenza viruses that are relevant to humanand animal&#13;
health and to determine the molecular basis o f host range transmission and spread innew hosts.&#13;
The long-term goals are to identifymolecular markers o fviruses that can transmit between&#13;
species especially to mammals including humans.&#13;
&#13;
A well-organized network o fdiagnostic laboratories forms the basis for the successfil&#13;
surveillance o f respiratory viruses andother infectious diseases. The clinical specimens taken&#13;
from animals are an important source o f data for surveillance.&#13;
&#13;
There i s an urgent need to network at least some o f the existing 250 disease diagnostic&#13;
laboratories which would help to decentralize the diagnosis o f AI. This would enable to get&#13;
quicker results incase o f emergencies. Prior to networking, it would beprudentto look into the&#13;
strengths andweaknesses o fthese laboratories to discharge their mandate effectively andprovide&#13;
corrective measures. The following are the strengths andweaknesses are observed with Regional&#13;
Disease Diagnostic Laboratories (RDDLs).&#13;
&#13;
Strengths o fRDDLS&#13;
(a)     Good state level regional laboratory network within the state.&#13;
(b)     Availability o f sufficient infrastructure, land, buildings and equipment etc.&#13;
(c)     Fairly good financial support from govt. o f India.&#13;
(d)     Some o fthe labs are I S 0 9001 certified.&#13;
(e)     CDDL (IVRI) is very strong and can leadthe RDDLswell byproviding training,&#13;
        Manuals, guidance, reagents etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   46&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Weaknesses o fRDDLS&#13;
(a)     Some o f the RDDLs are not independent andlocated inthe same premises as that o f&#13;
        Vaccine manufacturinginstitute.&#13;
(b)     RDDLs are not following stringentbiosafety level 2 precautions, including inadequate&#13;
        supervisionon waste disposal and laboratory practices with respect to the biosafety issues&#13;
        and good microbiological techniques.&#13;
(c)     Lack o ftraining to manpower on Biosafety.&#13;
(d)     Requirement for exclusive committed staff for implementingthe biosafety procedure&#13;
(e)     Placement and Transferpolicy o fthe government is affecting the functioning due to&#13;
        transfer o f trained manpower andposting o fpersons with irrelevant qualifications and&#13;
        training. RDDL functioning i s not exclusive. There i s an overlap o f RDDLb c t i o nwith&#13;
        state level function o f the institutions where the labs are located.&#13;
(0      Problem o f logistics insome places.&#13;
&#13;
OIE/FAO encourage countrieshegions to develop a laboratory network that would facilitate the&#13;
local testing o f specimens to decreaseturn-around time for diagnostic test results while&#13;
increasingoverall testing capacity. This network should be coordinatedthrough the newly&#13;
established OIE/FAO network (OFFLU) that could recommend appropriate testing methods,&#13;
provide training to laboratory personnel, supply quality reagents, and collaborate with OIE/FAO&#13;
Reference Laboratories.&#13;
&#13;
Itmaybepossible to analyze the samples for diagnosis ofAvianinfluenza inthe RDDLsand&#13;
some o fthe well established Veterinary colleges. Inorder to do so, there is an urgent need for&#13;
networking o f laboratories and re-fixing the responsibilities o f the National laboratory network&#13;
for diagnosis and active surveillance. Doing so would require the RDDLsto be upgraded to be&#13;
able to process the samples having live virus while ensuring the bio-safety. These laboratories&#13;
can undertake sero screening andreduce the workloads on HSADL. Inaddition, there are&#13;
laboratories established byprivate sector also. It may be worthwhile to consider accrediting&#13;
some o fthe University disease investigation laboratories (after evaluation) to maximize the&#13;
decentralization o f diagnosis to get quicker results incase o f emergencies, provided that these&#13;
meet the minimumcapacity for undertakingvarious activities relatedto Avian Influenza&#13;
diagnosis as specified for the various levels o f laboratories inthe national network (see Technical&#13;
Annex B inProject Files).&#13;
&#13;
Inthe longrun,HSADL andPD- ADMAS, Bangalore canjoinhands to develop and field&#13;
validate an indigenous software based ELISA Kit - which would certainly find immense use in&#13;
longterm national sero-monitoring and surveillance program targeting migratory flyways,&#13;
wintering migratory andresident water birds, ducks and geese and others (backyard and&#13;
commercial poultry). Also, this is a basic necessity ifthe Program i s going infor the use o f&#13;
`sentinel birds' to locate `H5N1 infected' birdsanctuaries, water bodies and wet landareas to&#13;
confirm their sero-conversion andto establish `carrier status' o f Indianwater birds.&#13;
&#13;
To overcome the spoilage o f specimens duringtransportation, timely testing o fthe samples for&#13;
quick results the sample flow shouldbeworked out within the laboratory network for easy&#13;
management and quality assurance. The routing o f samples might depend on significance o f&#13;
diagnosis. The samples may be submitted to different levels o f laboratories as indicated in&#13;
Annex VI. A representative number o fnegative and all positive samples must be submitted to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   47&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
National Reference laboratory (HSADL, Bhopal) to verify false positives and false negatives and&#13;
for further reconfirmation. Inline with international obligations, the National Reference&#13;
Laboratory needs to send selected samples to regional network laboratory and to OIEEAO&#13;
reference laboratory for validation o fresults.&#13;
&#13;
Laboratory techniquesfor diagnosis of HPAI. The current outbreaks o f avian Influenza A&#13;
(H5N1) inIndia andthe apparent endemicity o f this subtype inthe poultry inSoutheast Asia&#13;
require increased attentionto the need for rapid diagnostic capacity to enable to contain the&#13;
spread o fthe disease. Detection o f influenza A virus infections i s commonly carried out by&#13;
direct antigen detection, virus isolation, or detection o f influenza-specific RNAbyreverse&#13;
transcriptase -polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The optimal specimens for avian influenza&#13;
A virus detectionare tracheal andcloacal swabs (or feces) taken from livebirdsor o ffeces, lung&#13;
lavage, andpooled samples o forgans from dead birds. All manipulation o f specimens and&#13;
diagnostic testing shouldbe carried out following standard bio-safety guidelines. The strategy&#13;
for initial laboratory testing o f each specimen should be to diagnose influenza A virus infection&#13;
rapidly and exclude other common viral respiratory infections. Requiredprocedures for&#13;
influenza diagnosis are detailed inTechnical Annex D (inproject files)&#13;
&#13;
Cost of Equipment, Reagents and Consumables Requiredfor diagnosis of Avian Influenza. In&#13;
the country program on animal healthit is proposedto upgrade the existing 6 RDDLs including&#13;
CDDL to the BSL 3 level to enable to cope up with the increased work load on diagnosis and&#13;
surveillance and monitoring, and early warning system. Inaddition it i s also proposedto&#13;
establish one more BSL 4 laboratory to facilitate increased surveillance. Keeping the proposed&#13;
country program inview, the inventory o f equipment, reagents andconsumables along with cost&#13;
estimates i s prepared andprovided inTechnical Annex E (inproject files).&#13;
&#13;
B.1.6. ParticipatoryDisease Intelligence Constituency&#13;
&#13;
Community participation, particularly participation o f village women en masse inthe disease&#13;
information campaign against HPAIcanbest be attained by creating a constituency o f village&#13;
representatives, including lady livestock link workers o fwhich there are one for every cluster o f&#13;
5 villages inthe country. Village representatives would be trained to detect symptoms o fAvian&#13;
Influenza and other diseases. Training will be insitu (villages) inbatches o f 20 for duration o f&#13;
one day. Training will be impartedto them by the state Animal Husbandrydepartmentsinevery&#13;
state, over 75,000 o fthem in2006/07. The cost o f the training will be Rs. 500 per person,&#13;
including the IEC kit received at the end o f training, as a one time grant.&#13;
&#13;
Village representatives, estimated at about 120,000, will be the government's village intelligence&#13;
force, transmitting information on diseases to the nearest Animal Husbandryinstitution on a day&#13;
to day basis: the Participatory Disease Intelligence Constituency. Ifit i s decided to launch&#13;
vaccination o fbackyardpoultry at some point, these Village Representatives could play an&#13;
important role incarrying out this program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  48&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
B.1.7. Training;.&#13;
&#13;
Training activities involve Animal HealthProfessionals, Wild Life Technicians, Village&#13;
representatives, RapidResponse Team and Laboratorypersonnel. As far as Laboratory personnel&#13;
is concerned, the following category o f technical staff are requiredindisease diagnostic&#13;
laboratory depending on the level o f lab i.e. district, state, regional andNational, including: (i)&#13;
scientific staff: microbiologist (Virologist/Immunologist), pathologist, epidemiologist, bio-&#13;
statistician etc; and (ii)&#13;
                         technical / supporting staff: laboratory technician, laboratory attendant,&#13;
supporting staff for laboratory upkeep, animal attendants and engineering personnel for&#13;
maintenance o f equipment andbio-safety facilities (BSL3 &amp; BSL 4). The training required can&#13;
be considered mainly inthree areas depending onthejob requirement o fthe personnel,&#13;
including: (i) training inlaboratorydiagnostic technologies; (ii)    Laboratory bio-safety; and(iii)&#13;
Laboratorybio-security. Training details, including cost estimates, are provided inTechnical&#13;
Annex F (inproject files).&#13;
&#13;
B.2: HPAI Controland Containment&#13;
&#13;
India's containment andcontrol strategies for HPAIoutbreaks indomestic poultry follows the&#13;
OIE / FA0 Guidelines andwere formulatedwith the active participation o fthe FA0 Country&#13;
Office inNew Delhi. The DADF, Ministry o f Agriculture, Government o f Indiahas issued these&#13;
guidelines to the State Governments and the State Departments o fAnimal Husbandryfor micro&#13;
planningandgetting readytheir own control andcontainment set up. A multiDepartmental&#13;
Coordination Committee, chairedby the state Secretary for Animal husbandry, oversees the&#13;
operations andcoordinates the containment activities, while the District Committees chaired by&#13;
the District collector working with the District Veterinary Officer executes the containment&#13;
program. All through the containment operations the state / district Public Health Teams are&#13;
present inthe InfectedZone and take care o fthe house to house surveillance for identifying&#13;

The National Control and Containmentplanproposes training and equipping one Rapid&#13;
Response Team (RRT) for each district inthe country: there are 602 districts together inall the&#13;
states andunion territories and so 602 RRTs will be needed. Each RRT will have: Vaccinators&#13;
32; Cullers 58, Foggers 14; Local Administration Personnel including Veterinary Professionals&#13;
andParaVets 100; totalling to: 204 Persons; Training Durationincluding Simulation Exercise: 1&#13;
Day.&#13;
&#13;
B.2.3.  Strategic Reserves o f Eauipment&#13;
&#13;
The Program proposes strategic reserves o f essential equipment for stock piling, including PPE,&#13;
FoggingMachines andVaccination Equipment. Quantities are based on the assumption o f 30&#13;
outbreaks per year. Inthe second andthirdyear the requirementwill only be PPEs, inview o f&#13;
envisaged repeat use o f Fogging Machines andVaccination Equipment.&#13;
&#13;
B.2.4.  Vaccinations (financed from counterpart funds)&#13;
&#13;
The Programproposes vaccination for containment o fthe disease inthe surveillance zone o f 3-&#13;
10 kminoutbreak situations. The Go1has stock piled a few million doses o f killed vaccine,&#13;
even though actual vaccination has not beenused as a containment measure inoutbreaks. So far&#13;
Go1has made a policy decision on the use o fvaccination as part o f its containment strategy, as&#13;
some countries have successfully used vaccination for total control o f the HPAIincidence,&#13;
althoughup untilnow has not deployed this option inpractice. China has made extensive use o f&#13;
Recombinant Vaccines developed nationally, which have also beenmade available to OIE and&#13;
the UN.&#13;
&#13;
On the vaccine development front, several countries including United States, UnitedKingdom,&#13;
China, Korea andmany others have for sometime been working on development o f Avian Flu&#13;
vaccines both for poultry andhumans. Though humanvaccine i s claimed to be partly successful,&#13;
the recombinant H5N1poultryvaccine developed by China i s targeted to cover the entire poultry&#13;
population o f that country. Good performance claims have also beenmade byKorean groups&#13;
using avirulent H5N2 based vaccine, a closely relatedvirus o f HPAIvirus. InIndia already a&#13;
prototype vaccine has been developed at the HSADL, Bhopal which provided protection to about&#13;
90% o f challenged birds under experimental conditions.&#13;
&#13;
AvianFluspread isbest restrictedby a combinationo feffective surveillance, timely culling, and&#13;
mass vaccination with autogenously H5N1killed vaccine (Indianvirus isolates) startingfrom the&#13;
declared `surveillance zone' and then extendingto the rest o f the `infected district' and the state.&#13;
The `surveillance zone' must be vaccinated last to serve as an indicator o fpresence / absenceo f&#13;
perceptible virus activity around the confirmed infection foci.&#13;
&#13;
The advantages o fkilled vaccines include: (i)  temporary protection for a few months only, but&#13;
greatly restricts spread o f disease; (ii) / stops the spread o fthe virulent virus as vaccination&#13;
                                        slows&#13;
reduces susceptibility to natural infection; and (iii)&#13;
                                                    vaccinated birds shed less virulent virus, so&#13;
decreases contamination o fthe environment anddecreases risk o f humaninfection. Ifused&#13;
strategically, vaccination compliments stamping out strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 50&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Disadvantages o fusingkilledVaccine include: (i) virus canpass through vaccinated&#13;
                                                        virulent&#13;
birds; (ii)risk o fhumaninfectioninbackyardproduction system and at productionplant exists;&#13;
(iii)infrastructureforvaccineproductionhasyettobecreatedandriskofvirulentvirusescape&#13;
from production facility cannot beruled out. Inview o f this, use o f killedvaccine should be&#13;
restrictedto infected states for the present. Manufacture o f the Vaccine requires BSL 3 or 4&#13;
Vaccine ProductionFacility.&#13;
&#13;
B2.5.   Compensationfor Slaughter o f Poultry / Destruction o f contaminated Feed/ Eaa Stocks&#13;
(financed from counterpart funds)&#13;
&#13;
DADFhas drafted an actionplanfor compensation to bepaid inthe event that culling o fpoultry&#13;
and destroying thembecomes necessary duringcontrol and containment o f HPAIoutbreaks. The&#13;
policy is to pay a rate o f Rs.40 per adult bird, Rs. 30/broiler and Rs. 10 for chicks less than 10&#13;
weeks old that are actually culled andkilledby the RRTs. These rates are almost identical to&#13;
market prices.&#13;
&#13;
Marketprice o fanindigenousbirdfrom the back yard is slightly higherthan the marketprice o f&#13;
broilers and currently the price for a desi bird for meat is Rs.100. Farmers however have no&#13;
grouse about the compensation rate as they invariably bringa flock o fbirdsmade up o fbirdso f&#13;
all ages for culling: the adults among them being about a third innumber. So the whole flock&#13;
valued at Rs.40 per bird and for all birds culled from his flock is a fair rate o fcompensation.&#13;
Also the policy o fpaying a flat rate avoids all illwill anddisputes at the culling site, as&#13;
compensation i s uniform anduniversal.&#13;
&#13;
DADFcalculates the compensation findbasedonthe sound principle o fpoultry population&#13;
density inthe infected district. Usingthe density inthe district, the DADFcalculates the bird&#13;
population withinthe 10kmradius o f infected and surveillance zones. As there is considerable&#13;
variation between states and within states, between districts inthe density o fpoultry population,&#13;
the population density o f the infected district i s the most appropriate basis for calculation.&#13;
&#13;
Inthecaseoftheorganizedpoultryfarms compensation isbasedonactualnumbers culled.&#13;
However the estimated compensation find does not capture the population density inthese farms&#13;
as farms are not evenly distributed inthe state or the districts. So to be more realistic, the DADF&#13;
should calculate the fund on the basis o f the district poultry population density first; andthen&#13;
double it to adjust for the distortion caused by organized farms.&#13;
&#13;
Underthe Programthe compensation findwas originally set at Rs.6.36 Crore andnow stands to&#13;
bemodified to Rs.12.72 Crore. Based on the experience o fthe outbreaks that are now under&#13;
containment, the modified figure surely i sjustifiable.&#13;
&#13;
Onthe basis o fthe regulatorymeasures proposedunder the Program it seems appropriate to&#13;
bringinan element o fmoralhazard incompensation payments to organizedpoultry farms. For&#13;
instance, compensation mightbe linked to farms' compliance with established bio-security&#13;
norms as reflectedincorresponding certificates issued and maintained by industry&#13;
representatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    51&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Another aspect to be considered would be some form o fRegistration o f all poultry farms. It&#13;
would surely be possible to include inthe Registration fee a small contributionto an Industry&#13;
DrivenPermanent Compensation Fund. Thiswill make the Industrymore opento disease&#13;
reporting andwill enable them to cooperate with the Authorities inmatters o f Public Goods.&#13;
&#13;
C PublicAwareness andCoordinationSupport&#13;
&#13;
C.l. PublicAwareness andinformation&#13;
&#13;
The most effective measure to control the spread o f infection i s to limit the contact o fthe&#13;
infectedpersonwith the public. The planincludes social distancing measures inthe event o f&#13;
outbreak. It i s proposed to promote public awareness particularly the highrisk groups like animal&#13;
healthworkers, poultry workers, laboratory personnel etc. Communication strategy has been&#13;
developed bythe GO1incollaboration with WHO andUNICEF. A roadmap to further develop&#13;
andimplement the strategy during2006 has beenprepared. Prototype material has to be&#13;
developed andused through the rightmedia mix, It is proposed to involve the various&#13;
stakeholders. The aim is to promote public awareness particularly high-risk groups. Support&#13;
would berequired for development o f communication strategies, development o fprototype&#13;
material through various media and dissemination costs. Sensitizationworkshops for various&#13;
stakeholders would also be undertaken under the project.&#13;
The Information, Education, Communication (IEC) program is to be planned and mounted&#13;
jointly by all the stake holder ministries / departments. The DADF/ MoE&amp;F / MoH&amp;FW have&#13;
developed a communication strategy inajoint action group to match the contingencies o f the AI&#13;
situation based on the following elements: (i) right level o f awareness inorder to avoid&#13;
                                                the&#13;
panic; (ii)the needto instill confidence based on sound information; and (iii) buildup&#13;
                                                                                 to&#13;
capacities and resources to identify possible outbreaks andto mount appropriate response.&#13;
&#13;
Inlinewiththis orientation, the IECprogramhas specified: (i) holders andaudiences; (ii)&#13;
                                                                 stake&#13;
definition and sequencing o f contingencies; and (iii) andprioritization o f communication&#13;
                                                       listings&#13;
needs. This would be followed by activity implementationwithin the given time lines. The&#13;
stake holders/audiences include poultry industry,poultry consumers, pharmaceuticalindustry,&#13;
food processing / hospitality / and tourism sectors, migratory / wild bird sector, general public,&#13;
government departments, international organizations, NGOs, Media andparliamentarians.&#13;
Contingency levels include five phases: (i)   absence o f outbreak; (ii)suspected outbreak; (iii)&#13;
confirmed outbreak; (iv) human infection; and (v) pandemic.&#13;
&#13;
Key initiatives include outreach to at least 2,000 live poultry markets inabout 700 cities andwild&#13;
fowl trade points inselected towns; audio visual on good practices; T V / Cinema / Radio Spots&#13;
for Audiences; monitoring web / print media through weekly reports; advocacy kits for media,&#13;
stake holders andkey implementers, parliamentarians, conservationists, press advertisements /&#13;
foreign language communication. The proposed scheduling runs up to December 2006&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sub ComponentC.2. CoordinationSupport&#13;
The project would be implementedthrough the management structure created under IDSP.&#13;
However, incase o f out-breaks the surveillance committees would be required to meet more&#13;
frequently to monitor the situation andtake appropriate actions. The importance o fmonitoring&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
andevaluationhas beenrecognised inthe contingencyplans. A monitoring committee headed&#13;
by the Director General o fHealth Services has beenconstitutedanditmeets regularly to review&#13;
the situation. The perfonnance indicators to monitor the laboratory surveillance and the&#13;
programme implementationhave been developed.&#13;
&#13;
As far as the animal health aspects are concerned, the Project would support the establishment o f&#13;
a BirdFluCell inDADF. Both the Central SurveillanceUnit andBirdFluCellwould&#13;
coordinate closely with the Joint Monitoring Group on Avian Influenzaandwork closely with&#13;
the respective State committees for the purposes o f Project implementation. They would also&#13;
take charge of M&amp;E arrangements andtake the lead on a number o f HPAI-related policy and&#13;
strategic issues that have beenidentified following the outbreak inIndiain2006.&#13;

&#13;
Introduction&#13;
&#13;
InIndiathe value ofoutput frompoultry sector was nearlyUS$ 3 billionin2004-05, andthe&#13;
sector provides direct andindirect employment to over 3 millionpeople.' Ifwe take the value o f&#13;
the entire poultry industryincluding the investments made inthe industry, we get the worth of&#13;
the industry.The poultry industry inIndiais estimated to be worth anywhere between US$6 and&#13;
7 billion. The sector has beengrowing at a rate o f 10%to 15% annually for the last few years.&#13;
&#13;
Onthe trade front, poultry exports from Indiacurrently form a miniscule portion (US$ 80 million&#13;
only) o f its total poultry production.2The avian epidemic has come at a time when Indiawas&#13;
eyeing a muchhigher export ofpoultry after the Indiancommerce minister succeeded in&#13;
persuading Japan to allow exports o f frozen chicken from India. With Japan accepting the&#13;
certification andimporting chicken, Indiahas beenhoping to make inroads into other countries&#13;
as well.&#13;
&#13;
Other stylized facts o f Indianpoultry industryare:&#13;
&#13;
     0   Indianpoultry industryhas two mainoutputs: eggs andpoultry meat. Indiaproduced41&#13;
         billion eggs and 1.84 billion kgo f meat in2004-05.3 Indianpoultry industryhas 1.87&#13;
         poultry birds (1.7 billion boiler birdsused for meat and 170million layer birds used for&#13;
         producing eggs duringtheir reproductive period).&#13;
&#13;
     0   The domestic consumption o f eggs andpoultry meat inIndia is still low especially in&#13;
         rural areas where around 70% o fthe population lives.4&#13;
&#13;
     0   About 70% o f the poultry industryinIndiai s inthe organized sector andthe rest in&#13;
         unorganized ~ e c t o rHowever, growth o f organizedpoultry industry is largely inthe&#13;
                                  . ~&#13;
         western and southern regions o f India. Only a few farms have been able to achieve&#13;
         international standards for producingpoultry meat. This limits India's ability to meet&#13;
         increasinginternational demand for processed poultry meat.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
'Economico&#13;
1             Survey 2005-06; exchange rate used is US$1=Rs. 50.&#13;
  Exports f eggs, egg powder and poultry meat has shown a significant increase over the last few years. Poultry&#13;
exports increased from US$ 10 million in 1999-00to US$ 80 in2004-05. Farmers themselves export eggs and egg&#13;
products worth US$ 60 million annually while large corporates export more value added products worth another&#13;
US$20million.&#13;
  Average boiler birdweighs 1.6 kg. Assuming the recovery rate to be 72%, the output of boiler meat i s 1.84 billion&#13;
k g (1.6 billion* 1.6 0.72). India is the world's fifth largest producer of eggs and 14' largest producer interms of&#13;
                      *&#13;
poultry meat.&#13;
 A ruralresidentconsumesonly 15 eggs and400 grams ofpoultry meat annually compared to 100 eggs and 1200&#13;
grams poultry meat consumed by a resident inurban areas.&#13;
5 The poultry industryinIndia could broadly be categorized under three groups: (a) large organized sector under&#13;
intensive system (some with over 100,000 birds) consisting o f about 60,000 farms; (b) small sector with 25-250&#13;
birdsconsisting o faround 100,000 farms; and(c) very small back yardfarms raising lessthan 25 birdsthat&#13;
supplement the family income andprovide additional food for the family.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          57&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         Indianpoultry meat market is mostly a wet market i.e., dominated by live birdssale.&#13;
         Around 95% o ftotal demandfor poultry meat i s interms o f live birds; only 5% o f&#13;
         poultry meat is actually processed. Because o fthis feature o f Indianpoultry meat market,&#13;
         there i s a real danger o f the avian flu spreading to different locations unless strong&#13;
         measures are taken to contain it.&#13;
&#13;
Typically, market price o f a poultry birdincludes the price o f the chick, cost o f inputs that has&#13;
gone into raisingthe chick such as feed intake, pharmaceuticals, labor, marketing and&#13;
distribution costs, profit margins o f the farmers, agents etc. When demand abruptly shrinks due&#13;
to a birdflu scare, price tends to come down. Insuch an event, reduced demandis not the only&#13;
factor for reduction inprices. Prices also come down due to anxious sale o fpoultry by the&#13;
farmers andtraders (especially close proximity to the affectedregions) who try to sell the stock&#13;
at reduced marginsrather thanrisk the disease hittingtheir farms or incurring additional cost of&#13;
maintaining the stock inthe face o funcertain market conditions. This cumulative decline in&#13;
prices reduces the value o f output, andthis leads to an immediate loss to those engaged inthe&#13;
industry(depending onhow the risks are shared).Depressedprice delays fresh investments,&#13;
which inturnreduces supply o fpoultry. Reduced supplytends to restore poultry price andthe&#13;
industrymomentarily reaches new equilibrium, which is characterized byreduceddemand,&#13;
reduced supply andprice closer to the initialprice (pre-avian flu price). An implication o f this&#13;
analysis i s that price recovery is not a good indicator o frecovery of the industry. Moreover,&#13;
when demand gets eventually restored, supply i s slow to respond given the nature o f this&#13;
industry.&#13;
&#13;
Inestimating the direct economic loss due to avianflu, there aretwo ways ofgoing about it. One&#13;
way i s to start from the loss o f value addition at the poultry farms andthen take explicit account&#13;
o f loss to the supporting industriesbothupstream (mainly, chicken feed industryand&#13;
pharmaceutical industry) anddownstream industries (marketingand distribution industry) due to&#13;
reduced demand for their serviceshnputs. Another way i s to start from the value ofoutput o fthe&#13;
poultry sector. This value o f output would incorporate the value addition by the farm sector as&#13;
well as price charged bythe supporting sectors for their serviceshnputs to the poultry sector. So,&#13;
inthe latter way ofcalculating the loss, we do notneedto take explicit account ofloss to the&#13;
supporting industries. Here we follow the latter approach.&#13;
&#13;
The loss o fvalue added within the poultry industry, including that inthe allied industries, is&#13;
perhaps best captured by the loss inthe value o f output o fpoultry industry. Inestimating the&#13;
loss, we allow for the fact that demand for the poultry substitutes such as fish, lamb, pork etc.&#13;
tends to go up and, to that extent, the industries producing these substitutes tend to partially make&#13;
up for the loss that poultry industry suffers.&#13;
&#13;

                                                     58&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Avian Flu inIndia&#13;
&#13;
The first avian flu outbreak was reported on February 18,2006 inNandurbar district in&#13;
Maharashtra. A few days later, it was reported inthe Surat district inGujarat. There were&#13;
around 1million birdsinNandurbar district and around 0.15 millionbirds inSurat district.6 A&#13;
good number o f these birdshavebeen culled. About a month later, Jalgaon district in&#13;
Maharashtrareported an outbreak o f avian flu. All the 100,000 birds inthis district were&#13;
slaughtered. The epidemic so far appears to be contained and localized. But there is a veritable&#13;
chance o f its spreading to other parts o fthe country as well as to humanbeings.&#13;
&#13;
Eventhough the epidemic i s so far contained, the effects of it are already being felt by the&#13;
poultry industry. The economic cost o f the epidemic is both direct andindirect. Direct cost&#13;
includes the cost to the poultry (and the allied industries) captured by loss o fvalue ofpoultry&#13;
output, cost o f culling anddestroying the highrisk poultry (which includes wages to the workers&#13;
engaged inculling, safe disposal o f the killed birds, and sanitizing the area). From a country's&#13;
perspective, compensation paid to fanners for birdloss merely constitutes transfer payment from&#13;
government to the farmers and therefore, does not enter the analysis. However, ifgovernment&#13;
levies fresh taxes inorder to raise revenue for paying compensation then the cost o fraisingthe&#13;
taxes should enter the analysis. Inthe present analysis we assumeno fresh taxes imposed by&#13;
government to pay compensation. The indirect costs include cost to the tourism industry andthe&#13;
value o f lost humanlives.&#13;
&#13;
Inthe current situation, ifwe assumethat the value ofoutput was erodedby20% for aperiodof&#13;
6 weeks, then the loss to the industrycomes to around US$ 70 million (0.2                      * U S $ 3 billion *&#13;
6/52). Besides this loss, there i s the cost o f culling birds, and the cost o f safe disposal o f the birds&#13;
and sanitizing the area. Although inthe present situation the number o fbirdsthat are culled is&#13;
not more than 500,000, inthe event o fhaving to cull all the birds inthese districts, the cost&#13;
would be US$ 1million (1.25 million birds @ 50 cent^).^ So, the total cost would be US$ 71&#13;
million. There are no indirect costs either interms o f its effect on tourism industryor loss o f&#13;
humanlives due to the flu.&#13;
&#13;
Beginning from the current situation, two likely scenarios that can emerge infuture:&#13;
&#13;
Scenario 1(Optimist Scenario): spread o f avian flu remains contained, perhaps affecting a few&#13;
more areas but remaining localized; there maybe a limited spread o f flu from birds to humans&#13;
coming directly incontact with affected birds; no effect on tourism industry&#13;
&#13;
Scenario 2 (Pessimist Scenario): avian flubecomes widespread with the flu spreading from&#13;
humans to humans resulting inloss o fhumanlives; tourism industrytoo gets affected&#13;
significantly&#13;
&#13;
We work out the likely economic costs under boththese scenarios below. The costs are from&#13;
society's or country's perspective.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The two affected statesnamely Maharashtra, and Gujarat have 10.8% (8.9 and 1.9% respectively) o f total poultry&#13;
birdsinthe country.&#13;
'We  assume the cost o fculling birds, their safe disposal and sanitization o f the area to be 50 cents per bird.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                           59&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
As the avian flu spreads to a few more regions sequentially, which we consider to bethe optimist&#13;
scenario, there will be two effects runninginopposite direction. While reduced demandfor&#13;
poultry products would tend to increase direct economic loss, those involved inthe poultry&#13;
industry would start moving into other livestock products and this would tend to contain the&#13;
economic loss. Ifthe flu hits 2 new areas and later spreads to 2 more areas, we assume the net&#13;
effect o f the two forces mentioned above to result inthe value o fpoultry output eroding by 30%&#13;
for about 18 weeks. The loss to the industry would be around US$312 million (0.3&#13;
billion *                                                                                            * US$3&#13;
           18/52). Loss due to culling, safe disposal, and sanitationmaybe around US$ 3 million.&#13;
Inthis scenario, we assumeno loss to tourism industry, anda loss ofafew humanbeings, who&#13;
come indirect contact with the affectedbirds, would still be relatively negligible. Total loss in&#13;
this scenario couldbe aroundUS$ 315million.&#13;
&#13;
Inthepessimist scenario,the fluepidemic becomes widespread andthere is human-to-human&#13;
transmission, resulting inloss o fhuman lives. Inthis situation, the value o f output would reduce&#13;
substantially say to 50% for filly one year or US$ 1500 million. Cost o f culling, destroying and&#13;
sanitizing the area would be around 15 million. Iftourism industryexperiences reduction in&#13;
foreign tourists by 25%, the loss may well be around US$ 875 million. Besides tourism, the other&#13;
major source o f indirect costs i s interms o f loss o fhumanlives. The likely impact o f anHPAI&#13;
pandemic on unprotected humanswas derived usingWHO estimates o fhuman-to-human&#13;
transmission: (a) 30 percent o f unprotectedhumans are likely to be affected, (b) one tentho f&#13;
them will require hospitalization, and (c) one and a halfpercent o f all humaninfection cases will&#13;
be fatal. Supposing 30 percent o f Indians are unprotected then the size o fthe populationthat i s&#13;
likely to be affected would be 9% or about 90 million. Ofthis, 9 million would require&#13;
hospitalizationand about 1million people would risk losing their lives. Evenifwejust take the&#13;
cost associated with those who lose their lives (disregard costs o fthose who fall sick) the amount&#13;
turns out to be huge: assuming average productive life to be 15 years, value o fhumanloss at per&#13;
capita income o fUS$500per year, loss o f 1millionpeople would be US$ 7.5 billion (15 years                       *&#13;
$ 500 1million). Inthis scenario the indirect economic loss far exceeds direct economic loss.&#13;
       *&#13;
&#13;
Any o fthe two scenarios canemerge infuture even when aneffective strategy to deal with avian&#13;
flu is inplace. However, the optimist scenario ismore likelyto happen ifthe strategy inplaceis&#13;
really effective (probability = 0.8). Insuch a case, the probability o fpessimist scenario occurring&#13;
is very low (0.2). Onthe other hand, ifthere i s no effective strategy inplace, the probability o f&#13;
pessimist scenario becomes high(probability = 0.6) and that o f optimist scenario becomes low&#13;
(0.4).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
* So long as the epidemic is localized it i s unlikely to affect inbound tourists into the country. But this may be a&#13;
dimension to reckon with ifthe epidemic becomes widespread.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

          strategy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Thus:&#13;
With effective strategythe expectedloss is: US$2,230 Million (315*0.8+ 9890*0.2)&#13;
Without effective strategythe expected loss is: US$4,145 Million (315*0.6 + 9890*0.4)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                61&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
The cost saving with effective strategy under highly conservative assumptions could be as high&#13;
as US$ 1,915 Million(US$4,145 Millionless US$2,230 Million).&#13;
&#13;
To prevent the avian flu turninginto a catastrophic event, the government o f Indiais already&#13;
tryingto develop a strategy interms o f surveillance system andrapidresponse. The Bank's&#13;
support should bringthe "third party effect" inimproving the effectiveness o fthe government's&#13;
strategy. Evenifthe effectiveness o fthe strategy reduces probability o fpessimistic scenario fkom&#13;
0.8 to 0.6, it still yields sizable benefits.&#13;

            India - Integrated Disease Surveillance
            Project : Restructuring to include avian influenza control
            and human pandemic preparedness and response activities
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Integrated Disease
            Surveillance Project (IDSP) is to improve the information
            available to the government health services and private
            health care providers on a set of high-priority diseases and
            risk factors, with a view to improving the on-the-ground
            responses to such diseases and risk factors. A supporting
            objective is to minimize the threat in India posed to humans
            by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza infection and other
            zoonoses from domestic poultry and prepare for the
            prevention, control and response to an influenza pandemic in
            humans. There is one additional component to the original
            Project, which will be divided into three sub-components,
            including: (a) human health (b) animal health; and (c)
            public awareness and coordination support. Sub-component
            (a), human health, builds on ongoing integrated disease
            surveillance and supports upgrading of laboratories with
            information networks for influenza surveillance, and urgent
            human resource development to improve outbreak response for
            influenza. Sub-component (b), animal health, strengthens
            disease monitoring and surveillance; and extends efforts
            aimed at control and containment of outbreaks. Sub-component
            (c), public awareness and coordination, aims at promoting
            public awareness, particularly oriented towards high-risk
            groups like animal health workers, poultry workers, live
            bird markets, poultry meat handlers, laboratory personnel
            etc. Support would be provided for the development of
            communication strategies, development of prototype materials
            through various media and dissemination costs. Sensitization
            workshops for various stakeholders would also be undertaken
            under the project.
