RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT - PARAIBA&#13;
1.   RURAL POVERTY IN BRAZIL, THE NORTHEAST AND PARAIBA&#13;
THE RuRAL POOR AND THE ECONOMY&#13;
1.1  In Brazil poverty is concentrated in the Northeast and a few other regions,&#13;
particularly in the rural areas where half of all Brazilian poor live. The incidence of&#13;
poverty --the chief cause of which is the lack of human and physical assets in poor&#13;
households-- among the rural population is more than double that in large cities and urban&#13;
areas. Over the past two decades economic instability (real annual economic growth was&#13;
less than 3% in the 1980s) was a major impediment to alleviating rural poverty. Poor&#13;
economic and sectoral policies resulted in a fall in savings and accelerating inflation, with&#13;
consumer prices increasing as much as 30% a month. Austerity programs which&#13;
accompanied different attempts at adjustment between 1986 and 1994 reduced investment&#13;
for rural development, notably for basic infrastructure such as rural roads and water&#13;
supply, for primary health and education, and for small farmer agricultural services.&#13;
Migration from rural areas in the 1980s and early 1990s --caused by unemployment,&#13;
underemployment and lack of social and other services-- created an enormous new burden&#13;
on urban centers, and underscored the urgency of addressing rural poverty to stem its&#13;
conversion into an urban poverty phenomenon.&#13;
1.2   The Piano Real, launched in July 1994, has achieved a substantial degree of&#13;
macroeconomic stabilization, successfully reducing the annual inflation rate (currently&#13;
about 100%-l 1% p.a.). In the short to medium term, however, stabilization also implies a&#13;
very strong fiscal adjustment with tightening of government expenditures, high real&#13;
interest rates and, hence, a deepening of the investment pause in the farm and rural sector.&#13;
The consequences in terms of rural employment and lack of social services continue to be&#13;
serious, and clearly call for offsetting safety net actions. While successful macroeconomic&#13;
adjustment should promote longer-term economic growth with benefits extending to rural&#13;
areas, international experience shows that targeted programs and policies for the socio-&#13;
economic development of the poor remain an essential complement to the adjustment&#13;
process.&#13;
RURAL POVERTY IN THE NORTHEAST&#13;
1.3   The Northeast, containing more than half of the country's poor and almost two-&#13;
thirds of its rural poor, has long been considered the single largest rural poverty pocket in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
Latin America. This Region, covering nine states and part of a tenth, accounts for 19% of&#13;
Brazil's total land area and almost 30% of its 148 million population (1993). According to&#13;
a World Bank Poverty Assessment for Brazil, annual per capita incomes of rural&#13;
inhabitants in the Northeast are estimated at US$230, or less than one-tenth of the national&#13;
average.' Among the underlying causes of rural poverty in the Northeast are the relatively&#13;
poor resource base of large parts of the region and variable agro-climatic conditions which&#13;
make them vulnerable to drought. Skewed access to land and the virtual absence of a&#13;
functioning rural financial system for the poor are additional constraints. Northeast&#13;
agriculture is characterized by limited input use and slow rates of technology adoption.&#13;
Productivity is low, with output per farm worker less than half that of other regions.&#13;
Overall Northeast agricultural GDP growth was negligible during 1991-1994, and reached&#13;
less than 1% in 1995.&#13;
1.4   About 40% of the Northeast's rural population lives in the interior semi-arid zone&#13;
characterized by poor soils and severe, cyclical and often protracted drought. The&#13;
"drought polygon" in the semi-arid region includes most of Ceara, Rio Grande do Norte,&#13;
Piaui, Paraiba and Bahia, and smaller proportions of all the other Northeastern states&#13;
except Maranhao. The remainder of the rural population lives in areas which are generally&#13;
more humid and have better soils, the coastal belt and the drought-prone transitional zone&#13;
between the coast and the semi-arid area. The rural economy revolves around food crops&#13;
including fruits and vegetables, and extensive irrigated commercial export cropping and&#13;
livestock grazing by larger farmers. As a consequence of limitations imposed by uncertain&#13;
climate and market fluctuations, the rural poor in the Northeast, comprising small farm&#13;
owners, tenants, sharecroppers and landless laborers rely on a complex of activities&#13;
including the subsistence cropping of basic foods and small-scale animal husbandry, cash&#13;
crops (mainly cotton and cashew), casual agricultural and non-agricultural work and&#13;
remittances from family members living in cities.&#13;
1.5   Health and social indicators attest to the poor quality of life in the Northeast,&#13;
compared to the rest of Brazil. The region has: (a) a rate of chronic malnutrition of&#13;
children under five at 27% and, in the rural areas, 31%, compared to 15% nationwide; (b)&#13;
57% of households without piped water supply, reaching 91% in the rural areas,&#13;
compared to 28% nationwide; (c) 30% of households without electricity, more than&#13;
doubling to 67% in the rural areas, compared to 13% nationwide; and (d) 73% of all&#13;
households and 96% of rural households lacking access to proper sanitation facilities,&#13;
compared to 46% nationwide.2&#13;
1.6   Public investment in the Northeast in basic infrastructure --particularly in&#13;
transport, electrification and water supply-- has declined dramatically in the past 25 years&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

because of economic recession and fiscal crisis.3 The annual growth rate of public capital&#13;
investment in the region was 9.6% in the period 1970-80, 3.1% in 1980-90, but a minus&#13;
1.5% in 1990-94. The distribution of public investment between the Federal, State and&#13;
municipal governments, has also evolved significantly since the early 1980s. Comparing&#13;
the period 1970-80 to 1990-93, the contribution of the Federal Government to total&#13;
capital investment expenditure in the Northeast dropped from 58% to 47% while that of&#13;
municipal governments more than doubled from 90/o to 19%. The State governments'&#13;
share remained practically constant at 33-34%. In 1994, investments by the Federal and&#13;
State Governments increased marginally to 51% and 33%, respectively, while the share of&#13;
the municipal governments dropped to around 16%. The proposed project would help&#13;
compensate for the lack of public investment expenditure in the Northeast. The project&#13;
would also reflect the shift in investment expenditure shares from the Federal Government&#13;
to municipal governments by concentrating resource allocation decisions for subproject&#13;
investments at the municipal level and by leveraging resources of municipal governments&#13;
to increase investment in poor rural areas.&#13;
1.7   The proposed project would also be a natural complement to important changes in&#13;
the political economy of Brazil that were brought about by the Federal Constitution of&#13;
1988. Fiscal resources, priority setting and program implementation responsibilities have&#13;
been increasingly decentralized from the Federal Government to the states, municipalities&#13;
and local populations. This encouraging trend should help avoid many of the financial and&#13;
managerial problems which generations of Northeast poverty programs encountered under&#13;
centralized coordination and implementation arrangements. Much of the Bank's dialogue&#13;
and lending for poverty, including in rural development, health and education, have now&#13;
shifted to the states, with the role of the Federal Government being redefined to stress&#13;
more strategic functions, such as broad policy and norm setting and financial transfer&#13;
schemes to improve equity.&#13;
EXPERIENCE WITH PAST BANK LENDING&#13;
1.8   The Federal and State Governments have been involved since the early 1970s in&#13;
financing projects to alleviate rural poverty in the Northeast. The World Bank has been&#13;
associated for many years with these efforts, through its financing of a series of programs&#13;
and projects, including area-specific and state rural development projects, various sectoral&#13;
operations and a regional rural development program.&#13;
1.9   Historically, rural development programs in the Northeast have coalesced around&#13;
two themes: drought relief and the integrated development of selected areas. The first&#13;
has involved emergency relief programs or projects to increase the productivity of scarce&#13;
water resources, including large public irrigation schemes. While the budgetary impact of&#13;
these projects has been tremendous, their poverty effects have been limited and often&#13;
temporary. The second approach, that of integrated subregional development programs,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
has included initiatives like the Sertanejo Project and the Bank-financed&#13;
POLONORDESTE projects of the 1970s and early 1980s.&#13;
1.10 POLONORDESTE. The POLONORDESTE operations concentrated on&#13;
specific microregions within each of the nine Northeast states and the northern part of&#13;
Minas Gerais. They were comprehensive, multisectoral projects designed to improve&#13;
agricultural efficiency, raise rural incomes and increase employment. They typically&#13;
included components for agricultural modernization (extension, research, credit,&#13;
marketing, land administration), infrastructure (rural water supply, roads and irrigation)&#13;
and social investments (education, health and community development). Many important&#13;
sectoral initiatives were first piloted under the POLONORDESTE projects: farm&#13;
management extension techniques; integrated farm unit research for small-scale&#13;
agriculture, rather than crop-based research; a wide range of land redistribution initiatives&#13;
and modem land titling technologies; educational curriculum and school calendar refonns&#13;
for rural areas; and community-based primary health care schemes.&#13;
1.11  Nevertheless, evaluation of the POLONORDESTE projects by the Bank in the&#13;
early 1980s showed that, in the aggregate, they had only a limited impact on poverty. The&#13;
micro-regions supported by the Bank projects were relatively small areas in the context of&#13;
the whole Northeast; poverty targeting mechanisms were weak; and delivery mechanisms&#13;
relied exclusively on Federal and state bureaucracies. The Federal Government frequently&#13;
failed to provide adequate counterpart funds and delayed the release of budgeted amounts,&#13;
with damaging effects on the projects given Brazil's chronically high inflation.&#13;
Consequently, less than one-third of project funds reached intended beneficiaries, as&#13;
seriously reduced budgets were absorbed by administration and overheads.&#13;
1.12 Sectoril Loans and the Northeast Rural Development Program. These&#13;
considerations prompted the Bank and Federal Government to change strategies in the&#13;
mid-1980s. On the one hand, the lessons learned from some of the pilot efforts under&#13;
POLONORDESTE were promising, but it was felt that these needed to be expanded&#13;
geographically and supported by broader sector policy reforms, within the framework of&#13;
single-sector operations unencumbered by the coordination and implementation difficulties&#13;
of multiple components. A series of sectoral operations, such as Northeast land titling,&#13;
education, health, and irrigation, resulted in the next few years.&#13;
1.13  With respect to integrated rural development, this was still considered to be a&#13;
viable and necessary approach but, again, it was felt that the effort should be expanded&#13;
statewide in order to have a broader impact, and that the number of components should be&#13;
drastically reduced. As a result, in 1985, the Northeast Rural Development Program&#13;
(NRDP) was established to alleviate rural poverty and improve the living standards of&#13;
small farm families in the Northeast. Under this program, the Bank approved during&#13;
1985-87 individual loans for the ten states in an amount totaling US$826.7 million. But,&#13;
through 1993, with the exception of one component supporting small community projects&#13;
(known as the APCR), implementation of the NRDP lagged behind schedule and&#13;
performance in meeting basic objectives was weak. Some of the main causes were quite&#13;
similar to the causes of poor performance under the earlier POLONORDESTE projects:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
chronic fiscal deficits and other macroeconomic distortions led to almost constant&#13;
counterpart funding shortages and widespread deterioration of many of the public&#13;
institutions responsible for carrying out the NRDP. The Federal Government devolved&#13;
some responsibilities to the states, but, by and large, institutional arrangements were still&#13;
highly centralized. Decision-making, administration and financing arrangements were&#13;
generally non-participatory, and the sense of project "ownership" at both state and local&#13;
levels was limited.&#13;
1.14 On the other hand, the innovative APCR community-based components (para.&#13;
1.13), which stressed community organization and relied on local planning and&#13;
implementation, were noticeably more successful. They acknowledged the expressed&#13;
needs of the communities, their poverty alleviation impact was positive, the cost per family&#13;
relatively low, and disbursement and commitment rates far exceeded those of other&#13;
components.&#13;
1.15  Reformulated NRDP. On the Bank's initiative, in 1993 the NRDP was&#13;
reformulated and transformed into a community-based development program, drawing&#13;
both on the successful experience of the APCR small community projects component and&#13;
on lessons learned with similar schemes elsewhere in Latin America, particularly the&#13;
Mexican Solidaridad program. The outcome has been positive. Rural communities&#13;
participated in the identification, financing and implementation of subprojects that met&#13;
their most pressing needs, increased their sense of project ownership, and had a much&#13;
sharper focus on poverty alleviation. The reformulated NRDP covered all members of&#13;
poor rural communities and not only those with productive assets, and was based on a&#13;
"matching grant" mechanism linked to beneficiary contributions towards subproject cost.&#13;
The State Governments were fully responsible for counterpart funding, and the&#13;
corresponding sense of "ownership" of the program has been notable.&#13;
1.16 Based on implementation in the three years following reformulation, as well as the&#13;
earlier experience of the APCR components, certain facts are now clear. The program&#13;
generated unprecedented enthusiasm among beneficiaries and favorable multiplier effects&#13;
--with replicability evident in other programs-- and mobilized additional funds from&#13;
municipalities and communities. As much as 93% of disbursements reached targeted&#13;
beneficiaries, and diversion of funds for non-intended uses was sharply reduced compared&#13;
to past programs. The NRDP's participatory approach induced greater community&#13;
organization and empowerment, increased transparency, and demonstrated that rural&#13;
communities can influence the allocation and use of resources at the municipal level to&#13;
alleviate poverty. Investments funded by the program were of satisfactory quality and less&#13;
costly than those executed by public agencies. While the reformulated program was not&#13;
expected to change the basic agricultural economy in the Northeast, it successfully&#13;
reached a large number of landless families and land reform beneficiaries. Several field&#13;
investigations, surveys and studies have assessed the impact of NRDP. The consensus,&#13;
from a broad sample of completed and operational subprojects, is that they have had a&#13;
positive impact on the quality of life, and in the case of productive subprojects, on&#13;
employment and incomes of beneficiaries. In so doing, the NRDP initiated a process of&#13;
local accumulation and, albeit still on a small scale, elevated the socio-economic standards&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
of beneficiary communities that will progressively allow them to enter formal market&#13;
channels. Additionally, the program, by providing essential infrastructure and social&#13;
services to these communities, relieved some of the budgetary burden of the Northeast&#13;
states and nunicipalities. A summary evaluation of the reformulated NRDP is provided in&#13;
Annex B.&#13;
T1E STATE OF PARAIBA&#13;
1.17  The State of Paraiba --the third smallest state in the Northeast-- covers a territory&#13;
of 56,372 km2 and has a population of 3.4 million (1996 estimate). The state is bordered&#13;
by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, and by the States of Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba and&#13;
Ceara respectively, on its north, south and western sides. The state is divided into three&#13;
geo-economic zones. The semi-arid zone or serfao, falling under the "drought polygon",&#13;
occupies over three-quarters of the state territory and contains 40% of the population&#13;
(about 1.3 million people) whose living conditions are highly vulnerable to drought. The&#13;
agreste-brejo transitional region has an average annual rainfall of 600-1,000 mm and 5-7&#13;
months of rain; and, the zona da mata along the coast (Mata Atlantica) has a more humid&#13;
climate with rainfall of 1,000-1,500 mm and fertile soils. Population density in these two&#13;
regions is high, averaging 127 inhabitants per km2 in the agreste-brejo and 191 inhabitants&#13;
per km2 in the coastal/mata region against 29 inhabitants per km2. Two major rivers -- the&#13;
Paraiba and the Piranhas - drain the State. Underground water is plentiful on the coast,&#13;
but deep and of poor quality in the interior.&#13;
1.18  The indicators of quality of life attest to the severity of poverty in the state.&#13;
Paraiba has been classified, in the latest report on indices of human development prepared&#13;
by IPEA for UNDP, at the lowest end of the scale among all the states in Brazil. A&#13;
revealing indicator of the precarious living conditions is the percentage of the State's&#13;
population which is indigent, estimated by IPEA to have reached 1.5 million by 1990, or&#13;
47% of the population.' In the rural areas, the proportion of indigence rises to 72%.&#13;
According to a joint study by UNICEF and IBGE, 85% of the State's municipalities&#13;
harbor very precarious living conditions critically affecting rates of childhood survival.&#13;
Unhealthy living conditions stem from an inadequate infrastructure and a lack of basic&#13;
education or income-generating activities needed to overcome poverty, a situation which&#13;
becomes especially acute in the rural zones: (a) while 52% of urban heads of households&#13;
earn less than one minimum salary (currently about US$120 per month), this rises to 81%&#13;
in rural areas; (b) inadequate water supply affects 24% of urban families, and 95% of rural&#13;
families; (c) while 14% of urban families lack any form of sanitation, this increases to 73%&#13;
in rural areas; and (iv) illiteracy affects about 32% of urban persons over 14 years old,&#13;
rising to 60% in rural areas.5 Outmigration from rural to urban and semi-urban areas over&#13;
the past two decades has resulted in a slight decrease in the rural population (currently&#13;
4  Indigence is defined as the level of income that corresponds, at the maximum, to the value of a&#13;
"basic food basket" that meets a family's minimum nutritional requirements as defined by&#13;
FAO/WHO. Source: OMapa da Fome, IPEA, 1993.&#13;
5     IBGE, Census 1991.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
about 35% of total population). There has been, however, a certain deceleration in this&#13;
process in the past few years, as manifested by a negative growth rate in the rural&#13;
population of -1.7/o between 1991 and 1995, compared to -2.0%Yo in the period 1985-91.&#13;
1.19 As in the rest of the Northeast, poverty in Paraiba is closely correlated with&#13;
geography. The rural poor are primarily smallholders, sharecroppers and wage workers,&#13;
who depend on a diverse strategy of income-generating activities in which the subsistence&#13;
production of maize, beans, manioc and rice, and small livestock predominates. Their&#13;
well-being fluctuates with changes in the agro-climatic conditions. In the semi-arid and&#13;
transition zones, rainfall is scarce and highly irregular, yielding crops of low quality and&#13;
income-generating capacity. In addition to the lack of reliable water supply, these small&#13;
farmers lack modem production technology and basic infrastructure to store harvests to&#13;
take advantage of cyclical price fluctuations. Consequently, family income is highly&#13;
variable, and there is little opportunity for savings (see Annex A).&#13;
1.20  State Government Strategy to AUeviate Poverty. The State Government of&#13;
Paraiba, under its plan for sustainable development, is pursuing actions focusing on the&#13;
decentralization and diversification of economic activity and expanding access to basic&#13;
services. With respect to the rural sector, the State's strategy focuses on: (a) regional&#13;
integration of economic activity which recognizes differences in ecosystems and expands&#13;
on existing infrastructure; (b) creation and diffusion of technical innovations geared&#13;
towards local production needs and capabilities; (c) implementation of policies that make&#13;
maximum use of local potential, particularly water resources, to curtail the abandonment&#13;
of productive activities and outmigration; (d) land reform initiatives based on&#13;
consolidation and intensification of rural settlements; and (e) expanded access to basic&#13;
services for the rural population. The NRDP has been one of the State's most important&#13;
tools for promoting organized decentralization, local development and community&#13;
participation, through the establishment of municipal councils which generate concrete&#13;
investment proposals for economic and social infrastructure and local employment and&#13;
income creation.&#13;
1.21 Experience with Previous Bank Rural Development Projects in Paraiba. The&#13;
State of Paraiba has undertaken two Bank-financed rural development projects since 1978&#13;
under POLONORDESTE (Projeto de Desenvolvimento Rural Integrado do Brejo&#13;
Paraibano) and the NRDP. Paraiba's performance under Bank-financed projects prior to&#13;
the 1993 NRDP reformulation was generally consistent with the integrated rural&#13;
development and NRDP project experience of other Northeastern states (paras. 1.8 to&#13;
1.16).&#13;
1.22 The NRDP-Paraiba project closed on December 31, 1996, after a three-month&#13;
extension of the original closing date. Under the reformulated NRDP, Paraiba's&#13;
performance was highly positive. Nearly 40% of all approved subprojects were under&#13;
FUMAC, a result of the sustained and effective efforts of the Technical Unit combined&#13;
with a long-standing state tradition of associative action, and the restructuring of&#13;
ineffective FUMAC Councils. In the approximately three years following reformulation&#13;
(end-1993 to end-1996), loan disbursements in Paraiba reached US$38.0 million, as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
compared to US$21.4 million during the entire implementation period of the original&#13;
NRDP (1985 to end-1993), leaving at loan closing a balance of about US$0.6 million for&#13;
canceullation. On an annual basis, the rate of disbursements more than doubled from&#13;
US$4.4 million pnror to reformulation to US$11.7 million thereafter. Furthermore,&#13;
whereas targets at refomulation were only 920 subprojects that were to benefit about&#13;
23,000 families, by loan closing date a total of 2,308 community subprojects had been&#13;
fimded (out of some 4,920 subproject applications received from rural community&#13;
associations), benefiting some 149,630 families. About 74% of the approved investments&#13;
were infrastructure subprojects, 23% were productive and 3% were social subprojects.&#13;
MAN LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE NORTHEAST RURAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM&#13;
(NRDP)&#13;
1.23 The World Bank has 20 years of experience in supporting rural development and&#13;
poverty alleviation in Northeast Brazil, starting with the POLONORDESTE Program&#13;
(1975-84), a variety of sectoral projects and more recently with the NRDP (1985 to the&#13;
present). The NRDP, following its reformulation in 1993, focused entirely on client-&#13;
driven subproject investments implemented by the communities themselves, with&#13;
decentralized project management at the state and municipal levels and more transparent&#13;
decision-making and accountability for project performance. Implementation has provided&#13;
important lessons for the proposed project (see Annex B for further details):&#13;
(a)   Decentralization of fiscal and investment decision-maldng from Federal to&#13;
state and local governments ensures more efficient project administration.&#13;
Decentralization of resource allocation and investment decisions to&#13;
municipalities and communities should be accompanied by a clearly defined&#13;
and well-disseminated system of incentives and penalties to discourage the&#13;
misuse of funds;&#13;
(b)   Poverty-targeting mechanisms should be simple, explicit and&#13;
monitorable; be based on objective criteria; foster transparency and&#13;
minimize political interference in project resource allocation; and ensure&#13;
that project resources reach the poorest communities;&#13;
(c)   Participation in the financing of subprojects generates a sense of&#13;
ownership and a willingness to share responsibility for the future operation&#13;
and maintenance of project investments. Beneficiary participation in the&#13;
selection, execution, supervision and financing of project investments&#13;
ensures that investments respond to true, perceived needs, generate cost&#13;
savings and increase accountability at the local level; the organization of&#13;
poor communities heightens their awareness of available programs and&#13;
services, facilitates their participation and increases subproject cost-&#13;
effectiveness;&#13;
(d)   Sustainability of project investments has greater potential when the&#13;
municipalities and communities contribute to subproject financing in a cost-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
sharing arrangement and when there is increased beneficiary participation.&#13;
For example, the participatory process introduced in the pilot Municipal&#13;
Council component (FJMAC) of the reformulated NRDP ensured better&#13;
selection and prioritization of subprojects by beneficiaries. Sustainability is&#13;
also promoted when communities assume greater responsibilities and&#13;
continue to voice their demands in a concrete fashion to influence public&#13;
investment expenditure at the local level;&#13;
(e)   A widely disseminated and careflifly designed information campaign is&#13;
essential to ensure transparency and proper knowledge of the program's&#13;
objectives and contents by all potential beneficiaries;&#13;
(f)    Technical assistance and training should be accessible to rural&#13;
conmunities to enable them to identify, prepare and implement their own&#13;
subprojects, thereby augmenting their capacity to compete for investment&#13;
funds. Technical assistance should also be targeted to weaker&#13;
municipalities to improve their planning, management and financial&#13;
capacity; and, the quality of the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), whether&#13;
it provides technical assistance directly or through partner entities, is a&#13;
critical factor in project success and may entail the contracting oflocal&#13;
and/or international organizations to strengthen its institutional capacities;.&#13;
(g)   Standardization of subproject documents, technical designsand unit&#13;
costs simplifies the subproject preparation and evaluation process,&#13;
faciitates the procurement of goods and works, prevents overdesign and&#13;
improves the quality of subprojects, thereby encouraging greater&#13;
participation by poorer communities and reducing bottlenecks in the&#13;
subproject cycle;&#13;
(h)   Supervision, both during and after subproject implementation, is an&#13;
indispensable determinant of success and sustainability. It has to be&#13;
reinforced at all levels and involve local entities closest to the communities,&#13;
particularly Municipal Councils and NGOs;&#13;
(i)    A user-friendly monitoring and evaluation system facilitates the&#13;
subproject evaluation process, provides feedback and necessary&#13;
information to improve targeting and efficiency, and is an essential&#13;
management and planning tool. Project design should pay carefil attention&#13;
to baseline studies as the springboard for well-designed M&amp;E and for ex-&#13;
post financial and economic evaluation of productive subprojects;&#13;
()    Productive subprojects financed in a social context should be subject to&#13;
rigorous selection, preparation, technical assistance and supervision.&#13;
Eligible productive investments should be those which provide services for&#13;
a large number of community members; whose collective use is regulated&#13;
by strict operational guidelines (regulanento de uso); and for which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
operation and maintenance is assured by charging adequate user fees to&#13;
both association members and non-members; and&#13;
(k)   Dissemination of "best practices", such as experiences with NGOs in Rio&#13;
Grande do Norte, EMATER in Minas Gerais and with FUMAC Councils&#13;
in Paraiba, through exchanges of information among Technical Units, at&#13;
training seminars and workshops, can hasten learning and reward&#13;
innovation.&#13;
1.24 The design of the proposed Paraiba Rural Poverty Alleviation Project has taken&#13;
into account these lessons, which are consistent in many respects with lessons learned&#13;
elsewhere in Latin America and other regions with similar community-based development&#13;
programs. The project will expand the FUMAC approach and initiate a pilot municipal&#13;
funds program (para. 2.7), to promote decentralization of decision-making and resource&#13;
allocation to municipal and community levels, to relieve the administrative logjam resulting&#13;
from state intervention in the minutiae of subprojects, and to further encourage municipal&#13;
cost-sharing of subprojects. The project will employ a poverty targeting methodology&#13;
based on a series of poverty-related criteria at the municipal, community and beneficiary&#13;
levels, and backed by a strong system of operational checks and balances to thwart&#13;
mistargeting and misappropriation of resources. As a condition of loan effectiveness, an&#13;
improved monitoring and evaluation system will be adopted to reinforce the targeting&#13;
mechanism and to strengthen the management of the subproject cycle (paras. 2.31-2.40).&#13;
Equally important, for simplicity and efficiency in subproject preparation, evaluation and&#13;
supervision, the Project Operational Manual will establish standard subproject designs,&#13;
technical and financial parameters, and cost indicators for the most frequently requested&#13;
subprojects. In addition, funds for technical assistance to rural communities and&#13;
municipalities will be facilitated to actively promote the organization of the poorest areas&#13;
to enable their participation, foster community capacity and empowerment, and encourage&#13;
the active participation of NG3s and local grassroots organizations. Finally, greater&#13;
emphasis on supervision by the PCU and local entities of community subprojects to be&#13;
funded by the project will be supported with a larger share of Bank financing of the costs&#13;
related to this activity. This would not only secure the quality of project investments but&#13;
also ensure that implementation bottlenecks, if any, are quickly resolved so as to allow&#13;
smooth and successful operation of the subprojects.&#13;
&#13;

2. THE PROJECT&#13;
ORIGIN AND RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.1   The proposed Rural Poverty Alleviation Project is a follow-up to the reformulated&#13;
Northeast Rural Development Program (NRDP). Evaluation by the Brazilian&#13;
Government, FAO/CP and the World Bank has confirmed that this program, itself the&#13;
culmination of two decades of experience, successfully introduced an effective model for&#13;
rural poverty alleviation in the Northeast. After field-testing the reformulated NRDP&#13;
model for over three years, the Northeast State Governments are developing new projects&#13;
to expand its coverage. The proposed project in Paraiba would be one of the third group&#13;
of successor operations, which include the Rural Poverty Alleviation Projects for Bahia,&#13;
Ceara and Sergipe, approved by the Board on June 29, 1995, and similar projects for&#13;
Pernambuco, Rio Grande do Norte and Piaui, approved on December 12, 1996.&#13;
2.2   The level of poverty in certain segments of the population, particularly in the&#13;
Northeast and its rural areas, remains a primary concern for the Brazilian administration.&#13;
Because of the high incidence of poverty in the Northeast, this region is a priority for&#13;
public development programs. The cornerstone of the Federal Government's effort to&#13;
combat poverty and hunger is the Comunidade Soliddria program, launched in early 1995&#13;
as a broad framework for the coordination of rural and urban poverty programs and&#13;
projects and focusing on municipalities where poverty is most severe. Implementation is&#13;
decentralized, stressing community self-help and local empowerment, and concentrating&#13;
on four main themes: rural development, income and employment generation, food and&#13;
nutrition, and urban services. The proposed Paraiba Rural Poverty Alleviation Project is&#13;
fully consistent with this strategy, parts of which draw heavily on the Bank-supported&#13;
NRDP experience in Northeast Brazil (paras. 1.12-1.16).&#13;
2.3   The project is also fully supportive of the Bank's recent Country Assistance&#13;
Strategy (CAS) for Brazil, discussed by the Board on June 12, 1997. The new CAS&#13;
continues to identify poverty reduction as the chief objective of the Bank's assistance&#13;
efforts in Brazil. Regional development is targeted as a major means of achieving this&#13;
objective, with high priority for the Northeast, a region selected under the Bank's&#13;
Strategic Compact for enhanced support of rural development. Overall, the Bank will&#13;
seek stronger sustainability of the poverty projects, including increased cost recovery,&#13;
project designs that increasingly target development of the poor and not only poverty&#13;
relief, and stronger financial commitment from the municipal and state governments where&#13;
these projects would be implemented. The design of the proposed project also followed&#13;
some of the recommendations of the previous CAS and its Progress Report (discussed by&#13;
the Board on June 20, 1996), in particular that policy dialogue and lending should be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
directed to the states -whose role is fundamental in the provision of infrastructure&#13;
social services- and that the Bank should support efforts to decentralize and shift&#13;
expenditure and implementation responsibilities from the Federal Government to the&#13;
states, municipalities and local communities. Finally, in accordance with CAS support for&#13;
Government's macroeconomic and structural reforms, the proposed loan will include&#13;
funds for technical assistance to help the State of Paraiba to further identify and implement&#13;
appropriate reform programs to improve its fiscal situation. The proposed project, whose&#13;
design is based on the lessons and experience of the reformulated NRDP, will be an&#13;
important element in meeting the Bank's objectives in Brazil. As the principal donor&#13;
engaged in a sustained, long-term partnership with the Brazilian Government to address&#13;
rural poverty issues in the Northeast, the Bank is particularly well placed to support this&#13;
next phase of development initiatives for Paraiba.&#13;
PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
2.4   The project would assist the State Government of Paraiba to alleviate rural poverty&#13;
and its consequences by: (a) providing basic social and economic infrastructure, and&#13;
employment and income-generating opportunities for the rural poor; (b) decentralizing&#13;
resource aDlocation and decision-making to local levels by supporting community-based&#13;
municipal councils and beneficiary associations in investment planning and&#13;
implementation; (c) leveraging resources mobilized at the community and municipal levels;&#13;
and (d) deepening the creation of social capital that was initiated by the reformulated&#13;
NRDP. The project is expected to lay groundwork for, and consolidate, participatory&#13;
institutions and processes at the municipal and community levels. The project would&#13;
ensure that funds reach the poorest municipalities and communities, and would expand the&#13;
successful strategy of decentralization and participation tested under the reformulated&#13;
NRDP.&#13;
PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
2.5   The proposed project would include three main components, as follows:&#13;
(a) Community Subprojects (US$71.0 million or 90% of total base cost), which would&#13;
support small-scale investments selected and subsequently operated and maintained by the&#13;
beneficiaries themselves; (b) Institutional Development (US$4.8 million or 6% of total&#13;
base cost), which would provide all implementing entities and communities with technical&#13;
assistance and training to increase'their capacity and improve implementation of the&#13;
project; and (c) Project Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation (US$3.2&#13;
million or 4% of total base cost), which would finance project coordination and activities&#13;
to provide feedback on project performance and impact.&#13;
A. Community Subprojects&#13;
2.6   The project would provide matching grants to rural community associations to&#13;
finance small-scale subprojects (up to US$50,000 each) identified by these groups as&#13;
priority investments that would improve community well-being. Subprojects would be of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
many types, broadly classified as infrastructure (such as rural water supply, electrification,&#13;
local road improvements and small bridges), social (e.g., sanitation, community centers,&#13;
day care centers) and productive subprojects (such as communal irrigation schemes, small-&#13;
scale community agro-processing, provision of small agricultural equipment and&#13;
comnunal farm tractors, small livestock production). Subproject selection is demand-&#13;
driven and based on community preferences. The project would establish a negative list of&#13;
subproject types ineligible for financing and, for productive subprojects in particular,&#13;
additional and rigorous eligibility criteria.6 Subproject proposals would observe standard&#13;
documentation and technical, economic, environmental and sustainability criteria&#13;
established in a detailed Project Operational Manual, which sets forth procedures and&#13;
guidelines for implementation. The Operational Manual, based on the manual already in&#13;
use for the reformulated NRDP project, will reflect the lessons learned during the past&#13;
three years of implementation. During appraisal, agreements were reached on the needed&#13;
improvements to the NRDP Operational Manual. During negotiations, the Bank reviewed&#13;
a complete revised draft of the Operational Manual, and assurances were provided by the&#13;
Borrower that all project components and subprojects would be executed in accordance&#13;
with the Project Operational Manual (para. 3. 1(a)). Adoption of the Operational Manual&#13;
would be a condition of loan effectiveness (para. 3.2(a)).&#13;
2.7    The identification, preparation and implementation of all subprojects financed&#13;
under the project will be the responsibility of the beneficiary rural communities (see paras.&#13;
2.31 to 2.40 for a detailed description of the community subproject cycle). Three different&#13;
delivery mechanisms will distinguish how the subprojects are approved and the respective&#13;
inancing arranged:&#13;
(a)    State Community Schemes (PAC). PAC was the original subprojects&#13;
component of the refornulated NRDP. Under PAC, rural communities&#13;
submit their subproject investment proposals directly to the State Project&#13;
Coordinating Unit (PCU). The PCU screens, approves and releases funds&#13;
for subprojects, interacting directly with the beneficiary communities. It is&#13;
expected that up to US$19.6 million equivalent, or 25% of total base costs,&#13;
would be invested under this subcomponent over the five-year project&#13;
implementation period;&#13;
(b)   Municipal Community Schemes (FUMAC). FUMAC was tested and&#13;
proven successful under the reformulated NRDP. In FUMAC, decision-&#13;
making on subproject approval is delegated by the State to project&#13;
Municipal Councils, composed of community members and representatives&#13;
6  Eligible productive subprojects would be those which provide services which benefit a large number&#13;
of community members and for which a fee is charged for operation and maintenance. Productive&#13;
subprojects, as with infrastrture and social subprojects, must be property of the association as a&#13;
whole and not of select members. For each type of productive subproject, a set of operational&#13;
guidelines (regulamento de uso), developed by the PCU, would be provided to the association and&#13;
must be adopted. In addition, each subproject proposal must identify the source of technical&#13;
assistance for subproject implementation and subsequent operation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
of civil society and municipal authorities. The Municipal Councils&#13;
prioritize the demands presented by rural communities through local&#13;
consensu-building and approve subprojects, within an indicative annual&#13;
budget, for financing by the PCU. The selection process would be the&#13;
basis of targeting in the project since the communities themselves, through&#13;
their participation in the project Municipal Councils, determine where&#13;
project resources can best be applied based on their first-hand knowledge&#13;
of local investment needs. It is expected that at least US$44.3 million&#13;
equivalent, or 56% of total base costs, would be invested under this&#13;
subcomponent.&#13;
(c)   Pilot Municipal Community Funds (FUMAC-P). This new&#13;
subcomponent would be a pilot variant of FUMAC, in which selected&#13;
Municipal Councils would prioritize and approve subprojects submitted by&#13;
rural communities and then would finance them within the context of an&#13;
annual budget, which the State PCU would delegate to the Municipal&#13;
Councils to manage themselves. This annual budget envelope would be&#13;
allocated to the Municipal Councils according to a distribution formula,&#13;
based on clear and measurable criteria, such as rural population and&#13;
previous year's performance, for implementation of an Annual Operating&#13;
Plan (POA - Plmo Operativo Anual) prepared by each Municipal Council&#13;
and approved by the PCU. The Municipal Council would transfer funds to&#13;
beneficiary associations to finance approved community subprojects. It is&#13;
expected that at least US$7.1 million equivalent, or 9% of total base costs,&#13;
would be invested under this subcomponent.&#13;
2.8   Each subcomponent represents a greater degree of decentralization of decision-&#13;
making and resource allocation responsibilities. Moving from PAC to FUMAC to&#13;
FUMAC-P, the control over project investment planning becomes increasingly local and&#13;
rural communities gain greater voice through their representation on the Municipal&#13;
Council as well as through their participation in its decisions. This institutionalization of&#13;
the participatory process would protect it from political fluctuation, and would eventually&#13;
lead to stronger partnerships between communities and Municipal Councils and their&#13;
respective municipal governments in determining the use of public resources.&#13;
2.9   Given the overwhelmingly positive response to FUMAC under the reformulated&#13;
NRDP, it is expected that the need for the PAC subcomponent would diminish over the&#13;
course of project implementation, with the FUMAC and FUMAC-P subcomponents&#13;
gradually expanding. The continued existence of PAC would facilitate participation in the&#13;
project of those comnunities within municipalities which lack either the capacity or the&#13;
political will to adopt the FUMAC or FUMAC-P approach. When a municipality is well&#13;
organized and receptive to participatory decision-makdng processes, it enters FUMAC, a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
Municipal Council is formed and resource allocation decisions are made at the local level.7&#13;
Once the Municipal Council demonstrates effectiveness in prioritization of demands and&#13;
subproject supervision and a capacity to manage resources, the municipality is promoted&#13;
from FUMAC to FUMAC-P, and henceforth the actual resources are administered at the&#13;
local level by the Municipal Council based on locally-determined investment planning.&#13;
Flexibility would be built into the project to reallocate funds among subcomponents to&#13;
accommodate the expansion of FUMAC and FUMAC-P.&#13;
2.10 In compliance with Brazilian law, beneficiaries must form legally-constituted civil&#13;
associations in order to be eligible to receive financing under the project. Disbursements&#13;
to the beneficiary associations would be made through agreements (convenios) with the&#13;
PCU and/or project Municipal Councils. During appraisal, understandings were reached&#13;
on draft model agreements between the PCU, Municipal Councils and community&#13;
associations for the implementation of community subprojects under the FUMAC,&#13;
FUMAC-P and PAC subcomponents. The final model agreements would form part of the&#13;
Project Operational Manual. Beneficiary associations would contribute to subproject&#13;
costs, either in cash, kind or labor, and would be responsible for the operation and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M) of the investments. The minimum level of contributions expected&#13;
from the beneficiaries, municipalities and the State Government would be specified in a&#13;
cost-sharing matrix in the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
B. Institutional Development&#13;
2.11  The Institutional Development component (US$4.8 million or 6% of base costs)&#13;
will finance appropriate technical assistance and training in order for each group&#13;
participating in project implementation to acquire the capabilities needed to effectively&#13;
carry out its respective tasks (see Annex D). The project will consolidate participatory&#13;
institutions and processes at the municipal and community levels through the community&#13;
subproject approach, described above, in which well-organized communities with sound,&#13;
carefully prepared proposals are provided with financial support for investments, and in&#13;
which FUMAC Municipal Councils which demonstrate effective decision-making capacity&#13;
are promoted to FUMAC-P and rewarded with their own investment budget.&#13;
2.12 To encourage this process and to accompany the decentralized implementation&#13;
framework of the project, technical assistance and training would be provided for the&#13;
beneficiary associations, Municipal Councils, and the PCU, as well as other participating&#13;
entities (Annex E). For example, to derive optimal benefits from subproject investments,&#13;
the beneficiary associations will need accessible support for community organization and&#13;
subproject preparation and execution, as well as for training in operation and maintenance&#13;
techniques. The project Municipal Councils will require assistance to orient their decision-&#13;
making on resource allocation among community investments and, in the FUMAC-P pilot&#13;
7 Under the reformulated NRDP in Paraiba, 25 FUMAC Municipal Councils were formed. These&#13;
Councils will continue as FUMAC Councils under the proposed project or may be upgraded to&#13;
FUMAC-P Councils.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16 -&#13;
program, to create capacity for investment planning and financial administration. In&#13;
addition to providing or making available from other sources a wide range of technical and&#13;
managerial advice to the project Municipal Councils and beneficiary associations, the PCU&#13;
will need training to enhance its own project coordination and supervision skills. Also,&#13;
because the fiscal situation of the State affects both project implementation and state&#13;
counterpart funding, technical assistance at the state level is needed to analyze issues&#13;
surrounding the reform of the State and to identify measures to improve the State's&#13;
capacity to address the inherent causes of its fiscal deficit situation. The instruments for&#13;
achieving this capacity building would include a combination of workshops, technical&#13;
exchanges, on-site training, and more traditional technical assistance, drawing upon local&#13;
expertise within the state --local extensionists, technical consultants, universities, NGOs,&#13;
and other local service providers-- as well as national and international technical assistance&#13;
agencies. To this end, the component would finance consultant services, training materials&#13;
and courses, seminars, workshops, and related operational costs.&#13;
2.13 The implementation of the institutional development component would be&#13;
decentralized, and the provision of and accountability for technical assistance and training&#13;
would occur increasingly at the local level. In particular, project Municipal Councils will&#13;
play a critical role in overseeing the capacity-building activities for community associations&#13;
in their jurisdictions. Municipal Councils, provided with model terms of reference&#13;
prepared by the PCU, would contract technical assistance based on programs agreed with&#13;
the PCU, which would then release funds for that purpose. Institutional development&#13;
activities can be broadly categorized into five areas: (a) mobilization assistance and&#13;
training for participating communities. Organized and contracted by the PCU and&#13;
Municipal Councils, assistance would be provided for the organization and strengthening&#13;
of community associations, identification of viable investments, subproject preparation,&#13;
and operation and maintenance of investments; (b) capacity-building programs for&#13;
Municipal Councils. Organized by the PCU, the programs would include intensive&#13;
training on the role of Municipal Councils, guidelines of the Operational Manual,&#13;
subproject evaluation and supervision and related topics such as environmental assessment&#13;
of subprojects for each Municipal Council under the project, as well as participatory&#13;
plamning and financial management training for FUMAC-P Councils; (c) specialized skills&#13;
training for all participating entities. Based on needs, expert advice and "on-the-job&#13;
training" by local providers would be contracted by the PCU, Municipal Councils and&#13;
groups of community associations, in areas such as the use of standard designs,&#13;
monitoring techniques, and financial administration as well as technical support (e.g., for&#13;
groups of community associations on water use); (d) technical assistance for State reform.&#13;
The Secretariat of Planning (SEPLAN), through the PCU, will have access to technical&#13;
assistance funds (US$0.5 million or less than 1% of base costs) for consultant services and&#13;
studies required for administrative and other state reforms. During appraisal, agreements&#13;
were reached with the State on the content and implementation arrangements for this&#13;
Technical Assistance subcomponent; and (e) workshops and seminars for the Municipal&#13;
Councils and beneficiary associations, to exchange experience under the project. These&#13;
"best practice" exchanges could also extend to seminars joining all PCUs of the ten&#13;
Northeastern states to disseminate successful experiences across states.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
C. Project Administration, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
2.14 This component (US$3.2 million, or 4% of total base costs) would support overall&#13;
project coordination and supervision and would help to strengthen the effectiveness and&#13;
quality of project operations. It would finance the incremental operating costs of the&#13;
PCU, for overall coordination of project activities, and a statewide information campaign&#13;
to disseminate information about the project and its guidelines to all potential beneficiary&#13;
communities, to increase awareness, transparency and participation. For this campaign,&#13;
the project would finance: (a) local technical assistance in the design and development of&#13;
the campaign; and (b) the implementation costs, including posters, leaflets, radio spots and&#13;
videos. The preparation of a statewide information campaign. acceptable to the Bank&#13;
would be a condifion of loan effectiveness (para. 3.2(b)).&#13;
2.15 Given the importance of supervision to the overall impact of the program, project&#13;
supervision (Annex K) will be intensified under the project and, accordingly, will be&#13;
allocated half of the component's resources (US$1.6 million, or 2% of base costs).&#13;
Project supervision will provide the PCU with the necessary information on project&#13;
performance to make managerial decisions, such as the provision of technical assistance or&#13;
training, the correction of departures from project guidelines, and the promotion of project&#13;
municipalities from FUMAC to FUMAC-P. In line with the decentralized implementation&#13;
of the project, the responsibilities for project supervision at the state and local levels will&#13;
correspond to the PCU and the project Municipal Councils, respectively. Supervision&#13;
activities to be financed under the project include operational expenses for field visits and&#13;
subcontracted services from NGOs and other participating agencies.&#13;
2.16 This component would also finance the establishment of a monitoring system,&#13;
including the maintenance and use of a Management Information System (MIS). To&#13;
function as an efficient management tool, the project MIS (Annex H), originally designed&#13;
under the NRDP, would be improved and made more user-friendly and performance-&#13;
oriented. It would contain key technical, financial and socio-economic information on&#13;
subprojects, as well as cost and other physical indicators. MIS-generated project reports,&#13;
including monthly disbursement reports and semi-annual progress reports, would facilitate&#13;
subproject tracking and generate appropriate feedback on project performance. Project&#13;
performance and impact indicators would be regularly updated to take stock of project&#13;
implementation and included in the semi-annual progress reports. A Project&#13;
Implementation Plan and a matrix of Project Performance Indicators were finalized and&#13;
agreed at appraisal. In addition to financing operating costs for monitoring activities, the&#13;
project would finance experts in information technology and project management: (a) to&#13;
improve the MIS; and (b) to collect and analyze data on cost indicators and physical&#13;
parameters from the most frequently approved types of subprojects, so as to calculate a&#13;
range of values for these indicators and to adjust subproject eligibility criteria accordingly.&#13;
These adjustments would then be incorporated into the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
2.17 Finally, the project would finance consultant services to develop and implement&#13;
studies to evaluate the impact of the subprojects and provide feedback to improve project&#13;
operations: (a) annual physical performance reviews, to assess the quality and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
sustainability of common types of subprojects financed by the project, including reviews of&#13;
community-based procurement; (b) an implementation review, carried out at the mid-term&#13;
of project implementation, which would include beneficiary consultations to generate an&#13;
evaluation of project performance and impact as perceived by the ultimate beneficiaries;&#13;
and (c) a comprehensive impact evaluation, which would include a baseline evaluation to&#13;
establish indicators of socio-economic impact and a final evaluation of the project using&#13;
these indicators. Anmex H contains a detailed description of the studies to be financed&#13;
under the project.&#13;
2.18 During negotiations, assurances were provided by the Borrower that: a project&#13;
information and monitoring system, with reports and format agreed with the Bank, would&#13;
be maintained throughout the project period. The Bank would receive monthly&#13;
information on disbursements of project funds and semi-annual reports on subproject&#13;
activities and performance of project investments on July 31 and January 31 of each year&#13;
(para. 3. 1(b)); a baseline impact evaluation study would be completed within one year of&#13;
loan effectiveness, a mid-term review would be carried out in the third year of the project,&#13;
and a full impact evaluation would be executed at project completion (para. 3. 1(b).&#13;
PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
2.19 Project Coordinating Unit. The Secretariat of Planning (Secretaria do&#13;
Planejamento - SEPLAN) of the State of Paraiba would implement the project through&#13;
the PCU, represented by the Unidade Tecnica do Projeto Cooperar, which is the focal&#13;
point for project administration and for communication with the Bank and the State&#13;
Government. The PCU is the project's principal liaison for the Municipal Councils and for&#13;
those community associations located in PAC municipalities. Under the proposed project,&#13;
the PCU will shed some of the executive responsibilities that it held under the&#13;
reformulated NRDP, delegating these to Municipal Councils and other participating&#13;
entities at the local level, and wili concentrate on its monitoring, technical assistance and&#13;
supervision responsibilities.&#13;
2.20 The PCU boasts over a decade of experience in rural development, having&#13;
overseen the implementation of the NRDP project since its inception. The Unidade&#13;
Tecnica is headed by a General Coordinator who is assisted by three functional&#13;
Coordenadorias in charge, respectively, of administrative, financial and technical matters&#13;
(current structure established by law in 1993). Under the reformulated NRDP, execution&#13;
of the PAC and FUMAC programs was carried out through two distinct units, directly&#13;
responsible to the General Coordinator and the Technical Coordenadoria and assisted in&#13;
the field by four regional offices strategically located (Itaporanga, Areia, Patos and&#13;
Pombal). Of the PCU's technical staff, about 64 operate out of headquarters in Joao&#13;
Pessoa while an additional 20 are based in the regional offices. The organizational&#13;
structure of the PCU will be revised in line with the new project's decentralization&#13;
strategy, that would redirect the PCU's efforts towards monitoring, field supervision,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
technical assistance and training, rather than direct execution of most of the project&#13;
activities. Under the proposed, more simplified structure (see Organizational Chart in&#13;
Annex D), the General Coordinator, assisted by a Technical Advisory Group, would&#13;
oversee the same number (three) of Departments or Coordenadorias but the&#13;
responsibilities of these would be streamlined. The Planning, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Department (Coordenadoria de Planejamento) would be in charge of&#13;
preparing/consolidating project POAs, elaborating and refining the project Operational&#13;
Manual, processing subproject proposals received from the communities and the&#13;
Municipal Councils, managing the Special Account and coordinating the management of&#13;
subproject funds, monitoring project activities through the MIS, carrying out or&#13;
contracting evaluation studies, and finally preparing physical and financial performance&#13;
reports on the project. The Technical Operations Department (Coordenadoria de&#13;
OperaV&amp;es), in charge of field operations (including community mobilization, technical&#13;
assistance and training, and subproject appraisal) would function through four Regional&#13;
Technical Groups composed of multi-disciplinary teams with logistical and technical&#13;
support by the four existing field offices. The Administrative and Financial Support&#13;
Department (Coordenadoria de Apoio) would have responsibility for general PCU&#13;
administrative, financial and human resource aspects. In addition, the General&#13;
Coordinator would be supported by an Advisory Consultative Council, constituted by&#13;
selected personnel from the various units and whose main role would be to provide, as&#13;
needed, advice in the final stage of approval of the community investments to be funded&#13;
under the project.&#13;
2.21  The PCU's principal tasks under the project would include: (a) project planning&#13;
and coordination at the state level through the preparation of POAs, including the&#13;
consolidation of POAs by FUMAC-P Councils, and monitoring activities through&#13;
maintenance of the project's MIS; (b) promoting the project and encouraging participation&#13;
of potential beneficiary communities, NGOs and private sector entities; (c) preparing&#13;
project implementation reports and organizing evaluation exercises; (d) ensuring timely&#13;
and adequate provision of loan and state counterpart funds; (e) appraising and approving&#13;
all PAC subproject proposals; (f) entering into subproject agreements with community&#13;
associations (PAC) and Municipal Councils (FUMAC) and into POA-based agreements&#13;
with FUMAC-P Municipal Councils, to transfer subproject funds and monitor their use;&#13;
(g) overseeing ali monitoring and supervision activities under the project to ensure&#13;
compliance with project guidelines and to improve the quality of subprojects and project&#13;
interventions; (h) ensuring that environmental guidelines for subproject approval and&#13;
implementation are followed; (i) providing technical assistance to the FIMAC and&#13;
FUMAC-P Municipal Councils; (j) preparing statements of expenditure (SOEs) and&#13;
applications for reimbursement; and (k) ensuring that procurement, disbursement and&#13;
auditing procedures applicable to the Bank loan are followed.&#13;
2.22  Assurances were provided by the State of Paraiba at negotiations that proposed&#13;
POAs and budgets satisfactory to the Bank would be furnished to the Bank in October of&#13;
each year; that the Bank would receive a copy of the final plan and budget as soon as they&#13;
are approved by the Borrower's Legislative Assembly; and that adequate counterpart&#13;
funding would be made available for the project in a timely manner by the State (para.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-20 -&#13;
3. 1(c)). Approval of targets for any given year will be contingent upon performance in the&#13;
previous year, including a thorough analysis of the actual demand from communities, of&#13;
subproject costs actually observed, and of the number of uncompleted subprojects.&#13;
2.23 Project Municipal Councils. Municipal Councils are the key entity for the&#13;
targeting of project benefits and the allocation of resources under the proposed project.&#13;
By their nature as open and representative bodies which build consensus on priorities, the&#13;
project Municipal Councils instill transparency into the decision-making process for&#13;
FUMAC and FUMAC-P investments. The Councils would comprise representatives&#13;
from: (a) rural communities, civil groups and organizations such as NGOs, religious&#13;
organizations and rural labor unions; and (b) publicly-elected representatives and&#13;
municipal government officials. While the composition of these Councils may vary from&#13;
one municipality to another, representatives from rural communities and civil society&#13;
would make up at least 800/% of the Councils' membership. The PCU would participate in&#13;
the Councils in an advisory capacity.&#13;
2.24 The Councils would receive, prioritize and approve subproject proposals from the&#13;
beneficiary associations during regularly scheduled meetings which are widely publicized&#13;
and which the public is encouraged to attend. The Councils would deliberate and&#13;
prioritize the subproject proposals presented according to their determination of the needs&#13;
of the different communities, based on criteria such as the level of poverty and the existing&#13;
infrastructure of each community in relation to the rest of the municipality; the type of&#13;
subproject to be financed and its potential to improve the quality of life of the beneficiary&#13;
population; and the demonstrated participation of the beneficiary community in the&#13;
identification of the subproject and its commitment to the operation and maintenance of&#13;
the subproject. Decisions to approve subprojects would be made by majority of votes and&#13;
based on pre-established technical criteria and/or standard designs. Detailed criteria, rules&#13;
and procedures for the Municipal Councils' structure and operations are included in the&#13;
Project Operational Manual.&#13;
2.25 The Municipal Councils would be entrusted with the following responsibilities: (a)&#13;
promoting the project in their areas; (b) facilitating assistance to the communities for&#13;
organizational strengthening and subproject preparation and execution; (c) prioritizing,&#13;
through local consensus-building, community subproject proposals and reviewing them for&#13;
approval or rejection; and (d) monitoring and supervising the implementation of approved&#13;
subprojects. Under FUMAC, the Municipal Councils will present subprojects which they&#13;
have approved to the PCU for financing; under FUMAC-P, the Councils will be&#13;
responsible for managing the funds allocated to them and signing the subproject&#13;
agreements with the respective beneficiary associations (Annex F). Under FUMAC and&#13;
FUMAC-P, the Municipal Councils foster partnerships among the community&#13;
associations, the municipal governments and the State Government to share the costs of&#13;
the subprojects and therefore leverage the loan funds to finance increased numbers of&#13;
subprojects.&#13;
2.26 Community Associations. Community associations are the foundation of project&#13;
implementation. These associations are responsible for formulating ideas for subprojects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-21 -&#13;
and submitting these proposals to the Municipal Councils (under FUMAC and FUMAC-&#13;
P) or the PCU (under PAC) for approval. Once a subproject has been approved, the&#13;
community association enters into a legally binding agreement with the PCU and/or&#13;
Municipal Council through which the funds to implement the subproject are passed to the&#13;
association. The association is responsible for all procurement and record-keeping during&#13;
the implementation of the subproject, as was practiced successfully in the reformulated&#13;
NRDP. ' Beneficiary associations contribute to subproject costs, either in cash, kind or&#13;
labor, and are responsible for the operation and maintenance of the investments.&#13;
PROJECT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND TRAINING ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
2.27  Technical assistance and training to beneficiaries is an indispensable input to&#13;
successful and sustainable subproject investments. Technical assistance and training&#13;
would be provided to beneficiary communities via two mechanisms (see Annex E): (a) the&#13;
institutional development component (paras. 2.11-2.13); and (b) a percentage of&#13;
subproject costs allocated to technical assistance in subproject preparation. The&#13;
institutional development component provides flexibility and is not tied to any particular&#13;
subproject, so that communities can receive assistance even prior to subproject&#13;
preparation and after subproject completion. The component also allows for savings&#13;
because of economies of scale at the local level, since assistance can be contracted for&#13;
several communities simultaneously (e.g., retainer contracts for operating expenses of&#13;
local extensionists). Finally, the operation of the component is decentralized and&#13;
encourages local-level accountability. Municipal Councils will be responsible for applying&#13;
resources from the component toward assistance to communities in their jurisdictions and&#13;
all technical assistance and training agents hired by the Municipal Councils or by the PCU&#13;
and approved by the Councils (in FUMAC) would be held accountable to the Councils for&#13;
their performance.&#13;
2.28 Complementary to the institutional development component, each community&#13;
association has the option of directing up to 8% of the cost of each subproject to hire&#13;
technical assistance and training support tailored to the particular subproject. A proposal&#13;
for the use of this percentage would be included in the subproject application. In addition,&#13;
because technical assistance should extend into the operation and maintenance period of&#13;
their subprojects, particularly for productive subprojects, community associations should&#13;
include technical assistance among the expenditures to be financed out of O&amp;M funds&#13;
maintained by each association. As part of their regular supervision efforts, the PCU and&#13;
the Municipal Councils would monitor the frequency and quality of technical assistance&#13;
and training provided to beneficiaries.&#13;
TARGETING AND GRADUATION&#13;
2.29 Beneficiary targeting would occur at three levels: (a) geographically by poverty&#13;
level and other characteristics of the municipality; (b) geographically within municipalities&#13;
s  Beneficiary associations may request assistance from the PCU for procurement under subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22 -&#13;
to target rural settlements and communities; and (c) community-based selection of poor&#13;
beneficiaries and particularly vulnerable groups by the project Municipal Councils.&#13;
Targeting at the first and second levels defines the project area. The project area includes&#13;
all municipalities outside of the metropolitan region of Joao Pessoa, the state capital.&#13;
Project beneficiaries, however, include only those rural communities located in settlements&#13;
of less than 7,500 people, resulting in a project target population of about 1.1 million&#13;
people. The target population therefore lives in small, more isolated rural areas with&#13;
greater representation of the rural poor. The third and principal level of targeting is&#13;
community-based. Increased decentralization of subproject selection through the&#13;
expanded FUMAC and FUMAC-P programs will further strengthen the project's capacity&#13;
to reach the most needy communities in the project area. The Municipal Councils'&#13;
prioritization process is the basis of targeting in the project since the communities&#13;
themselves, through their majority participation in the Councils, determine where project&#13;
resources will best be applied based on their first-hand knowledge of community socio-&#13;
economic conditions and local investment needs. Clear and transparent rules and&#13;
procedures for the Councils' functioning are also important for targeting poor beneficiaries&#13;
at the lowest level. The effectiveness of the targeting methodology in directing project&#13;
benefits to the poor would be assessed through the project monitoring system and through&#13;
annual performance reviews and the implementation review (Annex H). Details on&#13;
targeting mechanisms are included in Annex C. During appraisal, agreements were&#13;
reached with the State of Paraiba on these targeting mechanisms; these understandings&#13;
would be reflected in the final Project Operational Manual.&#13;
2.30 Graduation of Communities and Municipalities. The demand-driven&#13;
community development model presented in the proposed project is expected to increase&#13;
the income-generating capacity and standards of living in the beneficiary communities.&#13;
Because project resources will be targeted to the poorest rural communities, certain&#13;
communities with better socio-economic standing relative to others would gradually&#13;
receive fewer investment resources during the course of project implementation. These&#13;
communities, able to leverage a critical mass of subprojects and other benefits from this&#13;
and previous Bank-financed and other projects, would gain access to other sources of&#13;
financing and reach a point where a "safety net" is no longer necessary. In order to&#13;
formalize this process, the proposed project would introduce a community graduation&#13;
strategy whereby those communities with demonstrated capacity for sustainable asset-&#13;
accumulation (savings), adequate social and economic infrastructure and community&#13;
organization, would progressively be charged a higher cost-sharing percentage (para.&#13;
2.45) and then eventually cease to be eligible for project matching grants (see Annex C).&#13;
To make this determination, profiles of beneficiary communities would be developed and&#13;
would include information on benefits from the reformulated NRDP and other public&#13;
programs, existing infrastructure and access to social services, indicators of&#13;
accumulation/savings (e.g., farm animals and equipment) and other indicators of&#13;
community well-being. The information would be collected from subproject proposals&#13;
submitted by the communities, incorporated into the MIS, and regularly updated through&#13;
monitoring and supervision exercises (see Annex H). The point at which a community&#13;
would provide a higher counterpart contribution and the subsequent "take-off' point, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
point at which a community would graduate from the project, would be estimated at the&#13;
end of the second year of the project, based on a study comparing community profiles and&#13;
indicators from the baseline impact evaluation. Using this analysis, the PCU (for PAC)&#13;
and the Municipal Councils (for FUMAC and FUMAC-P), with the support of the PCU,&#13;
would graduate those communities having reached the "take-off' point. As communities&#13;
graduate, those municipalities with fewer eligible communities would gradually receive&#13;
less funding for subprojects and, concurrently, would graduate from the program as well.&#13;
During appraisal, agreements were reached with the State of Paraiba on a community&#13;
graduation strategy; these understandings would be reflected in the final Project&#13;
Operational Manual.&#13;
COMMUNTY SUBPROJECT CYCLE&#13;
2.31  Mobilization. The critical juncture in the community subproject cycle is the initial&#13;
stage when communities mobilize existing associations or form new associations which&#13;
can then benefit from the project. At the outset of and throughout the project, an&#13;
information campaign, carefully prepared and targeted to potential beneficiary&#13;
communities by the PCU to create a level playing field for access to project funds, would&#13;
disseminate information about the project and its procedures to stimulate demand from&#13;
potential beneficiaries across the state. Some communities already have significant levels&#13;
of organization, either traditionally or from previous development projects in the area, and&#13;
are poised to benefit immediately from the project. However, for those less organized&#13;
communities, the project, through its institutional development component, would actively&#13;
extend mobilization assistance through the services of NGOs or accredited state agents&#13;
(e.g., EMATER extensionists) who know the communities well and can serve as catalysts&#13;
for organization. These NGOs or accredited agents would mobilize the communities and&#13;
provide them with technical assistance for identifiying and prioritizing their needs and&#13;
demands, preparing subprojects and forming associations, in order that all communities in&#13;
the project area can participate in project benefits. Through the MIS and regular&#13;
supervision, the PCU and project Municipal Councils would monitor the ex-post allocation&#13;
of project benefits, which would then facilitate targeting assistance to those municipalities&#13;
which had not yet received support.&#13;
2.32 Prioritization and Preparation. Beneficiaries submit proposals for subproject&#13;
investments based on priority needs of their communities. Standard documentation for&#13;
subproject proposals, developed by the PCU, would be distributed to the beneficiary&#13;
associations to facilitate the subproject preparation and screening process. To ensure the&#13;
quality of the investments financed and to provide guidance to the beneficiaries when&#13;
preparing subprojects, the Project Operational Manual would contain standardized&#13;
technical designs, including simple environmental guidelines and cost parameters (e.g.,&#13;
cost per physical unit or per beneficiary) for the most frequent types of investments.&#13;
Beneficiary associations may request technical assistance for more sophisticated or less&#13;
common subproject types.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24 -&#13;
2.33 Standard designs have already been developed by the PCU for a number of&#13;
subproject types. These designs would be updated on a regular basis under the project&#13;
and, depending on community demand, additional ones could be prepared for other&#13;
frequently requested types of investments (Annex G). In some cases, specialists would be&#13;
contracted to prepare the designs, based on terms of reference agreed with the Bank. In&#13;
others, the PCU would gather and adapt existing designs (e.g., for pipes or box culverts,&#13;
retaining walls, fords, and decks of bridges) and make them available to the Municipal&#13;
Councils and associations. Standard designs will include the following considerations,&#13;
where appropriate: (a) engineering aspects; (b) technical, financial and economic&#13;
feasibility; (c) operation and maintenance; (d) recommendations on environmental impact;&#13;
and (e) social demand. This process will be facilitated by the ongoing Rural Poverty&#13;
Alleviation Projects in other Northeast states, with considerable scope for dissemination&#13;
and exchange of designs between the Paraiba PCU and the other State PCUs.&#13;
2.34 Appraisal. The appraisal of community subprojects would be carried out by the&#13;
Municipal Councils (under FUMAC and FUMAC-P) or the PCU (under PAC). The&#13;
appraisal procedures would take into account: (a) compliance with the project's guidelines&#13;
and eligibility criteria, including those related to the technical, environmental and cost&#13;
specifications contained in the Project Operational Manual; (b) the beneficiary&#13;
association's commitment to provide the required contribution and to take full&#13;
responsibility for the execution, operation and maintenance of the investments to be&#13;
funded; and (c) in the case of an association which has already benefited from other&#13;
subprojects, assessment of past performance. Using standardized cost indicators,&#13;
reasonable costing for subproject implementation would be ensured. Departures from&#13;
standard designs would have to be fully justified in the subproject proposal for review by&#13;
the Municipal Councils and/or the PCU, as would proposed investments which fall outside&#13;
the range of standardized costs.&#13;
2.35 Financing. In order to disburse finds for subproject implementation, agreements&#13;
(convenios) would be signed: (a) under FUMAC, between the PCU, the Municipal&#13;
Council and the beneficiary association for subproject funding and implementation; (b)&#13;
under FUMAC-P, between the Municipal Council and the association, for subproject&#13;
finding and implementation, and between the PCU and the Municipal Council for release&#13;
of project funds; and (c) under PAC, between the PCU and the beneficiary association for&#13;
subproject funding and implementation. Such agreements would spell out the terms and&#13;
conditions for the funding, execution, ownership, operation and maintenance of the&#13;
approved subprojects (para. 2.10). The final model agreements would form part of the&#13;
Project Operational Manual.&#13;
2.36 Subproject Supervision. Direct supervision and administration of the subprojects&#13;
are carried out by a community-elected Supervision and Control Committee (Annex D),&#13;
which oversees subproject execution, including contracting. This Committee of three to&#13;
four persons is comprised of subproject beneficiaries, both members of the association and&#13;
non-members within the community. The PCU, the Municipal Councils or other&#13;
contracted groups, would visit the subproject sites during subproject execution to liaise&#13;
with the Supervision Committee and monitor physical and financial progress. The PCU&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25 -&#13;
would have overall responsibility for supervision of the entire subproject cycle through the&#13;
project Management Information System (MIS) (Annex H), which would track subproject&#13;
progress from initial submission to completion, and through accounting and auditing&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
2.37 Operation and Maintenance (O&amp;M). Community associations would bear the&#13;
responsibility for O&amp;M for all investments, as specified in the convenio for release of&#13;
project funds. These associations may request technical assistance to develop O&amp;M&#13;
programs and techniques. Experience under the NRDP has been positive with respect to&#13;
O&amp;M of investments when local communities have a strong sense of ownership.&#13;
2.38 Operational Checks and Balances. Operational checks and balances, included in&#13;
the Project Operational Manual, would promote transparency and accountability in the use&#13;
of project funds. Increased decentralization of resources and decision-making to&#13;
beneficiary associations and Municipal Councils, with only ex-post control by the State&#13;
through audit of accounts and supervision and monitoring by the PCU, is central to the&#13;
project strategy. However, this advancement would be accompanied by operational&#13;
disincentives, based mainly on education/joint problem solving and, as a last resort,&#13;
penalties, to deter potential departures from project guidelines such as misappropriation,&#13;
mistargeting, lack of participation or improper O&amp;M. Positive incentives for adherence to&#13;
project guidelines and or superior performance include the promotion of Municipal&#13;
Councils from FUMAC to FUMAC-P and, in FUMAC-P, a potential increase in the&#13;
Councils' budget envelope.&#13;
2.39 Project Monitoring and Supervision. Analysis of implementation will depend&#13;
on a database of subproject information from the project MIS, created under the&#13;
reformulated NRDP and to be improved under the project (para. 2.16). Inputs to the&#13;
database would be made from a standard data sheet at key stages of the subproject cycle&#13;
(e.g., identification, appraisal, procurement and disbursement. See also Annex H).&#13;
Periodic processing of the database information wilH permit the monitoring of the&#13;
characteristics and evolution of project implementation. The PCU, together with project&#13;
Municipal Councils, wili be responsible for meeting and reporting on the project&#13;
performance indicators (para. 2.16). The Bank's Recife Office would monitor project&#13;
performance indicators through the MIS, which the Recife Office will maintain and update&#13;
on a regular basis with inputs from the states, and through review of monthly&#13;
disbursement summaries. The Recife Office will also supervise subproject implementation&#13;
progress on a sample basis in the field (see Annex K for Supervision Plan).&#13;
2.40 Project Operational Manual. The NRDP Operational Manual (Annex M) would&#13;
be adjusted and expanded to reflect the need for fine-tuning and additions based on recent&#13;
experience. Agreements were reached with the State during appraisal on the following&#13;
points to update and/or include in the Manual: (a) indicative quantitative and qualitative&#13;
targets to be tracked with the Project MIS; (b) the project area and the criteria used to&#13;
select the municipalities included in the project area; (c) the initial distribution of&#13;
municipalities among the three components (FUMAC, FUMAC-P and PAC) and the&#13;
criteria for future redistribution; (d)' guidelines for the pilot component (FUMAC-P); (e)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26 -&#13;
arrangements for institutional strengthening and project administration, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation; (f) the PCU's new structure and additional technical support agreements with&#13;
other state agencies and non-governmental organizations; (g) FUMAC and FUMAC-P&#13;
Municipal Councils' composition, responsibilities and modus operandi, notably in relation&#13;
to FUMAC-P; (h) clear identification and description of responsibilities of beneficiaries&#13;
and municipalities in the implementation of subprojects; (i) guidelines for environmental&#13;
assessment of subprojects; (j) model agreements to be signed between the PCU, the&#13;
Municipal Councils and beneficiary associations; (k) new standard agreements between the&#13;
PCU and the FUMAC-P Municipal Councils and between the FUMAC-P Municipal&#13;
Councils and the beneficiary associations; (l)standard forms for proposals to be submitted&#13;
by potential beneficiaries; (m) the cost-sharing matrix for the various types of subprojects;&#13;
(n) the fund release mechanism to beneficiaries for FUMAC-P; (o) operational incentives&#13;
and penalties; (p) monitoring arrangements, including a new classification of the various&#13;
categories of subprojects; (q) standard project designs and their role in the appraisal of&#13;
proposals submitted by beneficiaries; (r) a revised standard form of acceptance of&#13;
completed works (ata de recebimento); and (s) targeting mechanisms and a community&#13;
graduation strategy.&#13;
PROJECT COSTS&#13;
2.41  The total project cost, calculated in May 1997 prices and including contingencies,&#13;
is estimated at US$80.0 million. Foreign exchange costs are estimated to be US$16.6&#13;
million, equivalent to about 21% of total project cost. The baseline cost is estimated at&#13;
US$79.0 million, and contingencies at US$1.0 million. Contingencies are low because&#13;
they apply only to the two components of institutional development (except for costs&#13;
associated with technical assistance for state reform) and project administration,&#13;
supervision, monitoring and evaluation. For these activities, physical contingencies of&#13;
1 0%/O and 5% have been included, as well as annual price increases averaging 2.4% for&#13;
local and foreign costs (both expressed in US dollars). No contingency provisions have&#13;
been applied to the community subprojects component. Since the number of community&#13;
investments is not defined ex ante, it was considered preferable that any change in physical&#13;
or price attributes of subproject investments would be accommodated by a change in the&#13;
number of subprojects approved and implemented.&#13;
2.42  Investments in subprojects are expected to represent some 90% of the total base&#13;
cost (56% for FUMAC, 9%o for FUMAC-P and 25% for PAC). The distribution among&#13;
different categories of subprojects, as well as the phasing of expenditures over the five-&#13;
year implementation period, are indicative only, and there would be flexibility to reallocate&#13;
finds from the PAC to the FUMAC or FUMAC-P subcomponents as Municipal Councils&#13;
gain experience.&#13;
FINANCING PLAN&#13;
2.43 The Borrower would be the State of Paraiba. The loan would be guaranteed by&#13;
the Federative Republic of Brazil. In accordance with the CAS Progress Report discussed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
by the Board in June 1996 as well as with the new CAS discussed by the Board on June&#13;
12, 1997, and in reference to the strategy to be adopted for special assistance to poor&#13;
States, the State of Paraiba qualifies as a Borrower in the context of this loan. The State&#13;
Government of Paraiba has formulated and is adopting measures for administrative and&#13;
other state reforms that will improve its fiscal situation and ensure its capacity to&#13;
contribute required counterpart funding to the project and to repay the loan.9&#13;
2.44 The Bank loan would be repayable over 15 years, including a five-year grace&#13;
period, and would bear interest at the Bank's standard variable rate. The loan of US$60&#13;
million equivalent would finance about 75% of the total project cost, and would disburse&#13;
against 100% of expenditures for technical assistance, training and evaluation studies,&#13;
75% of expenditures for community subprojects, 50% of expenditures for supervision&#13;
(except salaries) and 20% of incremental project administrative costs (except salaries) and&#13;
monitoring. The State Government would be responsible for the remaining 25% of total&#13;
project cost, with beneficiaries and their respective municipal governments contributing to&#13;
these counterpart funds. As it consistently did under the reformulated NRDP, the State&#13;
Government of Paraiba is expected to meet its counterpart funding obligations under the&#13;
new project, which would require annual counterpart funding of about 1.5% of the State's&#13;
capital investment budget. Beneficiaries would provide a minimum of 10% of the total&#13;
costs of community-managed investments, in cash, labor or kind, amounting to about&#13;
US$7.1 million. To enable the early start-up of project activities, retroactive financing&#13;
would be provided up to a maximum of US$6 million in respect of eligible expenditures&#13;
incurred up to twelve months before loan signing, but after May 9, 1997, when the project&#13;
was appraised. In addition to training for new Municipal Councils, the State already has a&#13;
substantial pipeline of community subprojects for review and financing for which it can&#13;
utilize this retroactive financing facility. Detailed project costs and the financing plan are&#13;
presented in the table below.&#13;

Directors upon request.&#13;

2.45  Cost Sharing and Sustainability. The cost estimates and average size of&#13;
community-manag6d subproject investments have been determined based on the&#13;
expenrence gained under the reformulated NRDP and the operation of its PAC and&#13;
FUMAC components. On this basis, the project is expected to finance some 2,840&#13;
community-managed subprojects over five years. Counterpart contributions by the&#13;
beneficiary communities and their respective municipal governments would be made&#13;
according to a cost-sharing matrix, which is part of the Project Operational Manual (para.&#13;
2.40). The minimum contribution of beneficiaries would be 10% --to increase for&#13;
beneficiaries from select communities as a first step toward graduation from the project--&#13;
and of municipal governments would be 5% (recommended but not required). The&#13;
relative share contributed by each community and municipal government would be based&#13;
on agreementIbetween the two parties with the Municipal Council. As in the existing&#13;
NRDP, ownership of project facilities by the beneficiaries should enhance the sustainability&#13;
of conmunity investments. A key element would be the establishment of sound&#13;
arrangements under the project for the provision of operating, maintenance and capital&#13;
replacement expenditures, the requirements for which would vary significantly among&#13;
types of subprojects and the availability of which would vary by municipality and&#13;
conumunity association. The Project Operational Manual and the subproject agreements&#13;
(connios) (para. 2.10) would contain specific guidelines conceming the finding ofthese&#13;
costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
2.46 Experience with the reformulated NRDP indicates that the sustainability of the&#13;
community subprojects is generally good. Subprojects would finance relatively small&#13;
investments which can easily be maintained by the communities themselves, both&#13;
technically and financially, as demonstrated under the NRDP, even prior to the 1993&#13;
reformulation with the APCR component (see para. 1.13). Equally important is the fact&#13;
that client-driven subprojects, identified and implemented by the communities, have&#13;
demonstrated a high degree of ownership by the beneficiary groups and their consequent&#13;
willingness to maintain project investments. Under the reformulated NRDP, commitment&#13;
by each community group for operation and maintenance was a condition for the approval&#13;
of subprojects, and formed part of the subproject agreement to be signed with the&#13;
beneficiary community. Compliance has been good and these same features are built into&#13;
the proposed project. Finally, the formation and strengthening of project Municipal&#13;
Councils, which have been piloted successfully under the reformulated NRDP and will&#13;
continue under the proposed project, stimulate grassroots participation in local&#13;
development, and thus foster longer-term project sustainability.&#13;
PROCUREMENT&#13;
2.47 Procurement for community subprojects costing the equivalent of US$50,000 or&#13;
less and procured by local communities, would be carried out mainly through direct&#13;
contracting, and under subproject agreements signed between the PCU and the&#13;
community. This procurement procedure is appropriate because most subprojects: (a)&#13;
would be small and/or implemented in scattered or remote areas and therefore it will be&#13;
difficult to obtain competitive proposals; (b) can be managed directly by rural communities&#13;
which will contribute to the work through the donation of unskilled labor and local&#13;
materials; (c) wilH be selected on the basis of willingness of the beneficiary communities to&#13;
contribute to and physically supervise their execution; and (d) would provide a vehicle for&#13;
communities to play an active role in the local development process. There may be cases&#13;
when the community lacks the capacity to make the necessary purchases of equipment and&#13;
materials. For such subprojects, the PCU would make purchases on behalf of the&#13;
communities, packaging the procurement for several subprojects whenever possible.&#13;
Procurement by the PCU would follow: (a) National Shopping procedures for goods, and&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank for procurement of small works under lump sum, fixed&#13;
price contracts awarded on the basis of price quotations (under US$100,000 and up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$1.6 million for goods and US$2.0 million for small works); or&#13;
(b) National Competitive Bidding -- NCB (over US$100,000). For NCB the standard&#13;
bidding documents agreed between the Bank and the Federal Government of Brazil will be&#13;
used. ICB is not anticipated for any goods or works under the project. Although the&#13;
costs of individual subprojects may not exceed US$50,000, the average size of the&#13;
subprojects is expected to be less than US$30,000. Approximately 570 subprojects are&#13;
expected to be implemented yearly using these procurement methods.&#13;
2.48 Prior review of procurement documentation by the Bank would be made for all&#13;
NCB contracts. Although the level of Bank prior review of procurement would be low, it&#13;
would be compensated in several ways. First, a study of procurement by community&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
contracting would be cafried out during the first year of the project, under terms of&#13;
reference agreed during appraisal. Second, cost comparisons of similar subprojects would&#13;
be conducted using the project MIS (para. 2.16) in order to detect possible procurement&#13;
problems. Third, the project physical performance evaluation (Annex H) would analyze&#13;
procurement issues; and finally, during Bank supervision, random reviews would be&#13;
conducted of subprojects, including field visits and review of subproject documentation.&#13;
2.49   Consultant services to provide technical assistance and training to the beneficiary&#13;
communities, the Municipal Councils and the PCU would be procured in accordance with&#13;
Bank guidelines for the use of consultants. Contracts, short lists, and selection procedures&#13;
for technical assistance and training would receive prior review by the Bank when the&#13;
value of the contract is US$100,000 or more for consulting firms or US$50,000 or more&#13;
for individual consultants. All consultant terms of reference would be subject to Bank&#13;
prior review. During negotiations, assurances were provided by the State of Paraiba that:&#13;
(a) the above procurement arrangements would be followed (para. 3. 1(d)); and (b) the&#13;
study of procurement by community contracting referred to in para. 2.48 would be carried&#13;
out during the first year of the project and any agreed recommendations adopted&#13;
expeditiously (para. 3. 1(d)). Procurement arrangements are summarized in the table&#13;
below.&#13;

DISBURSEMENTS AND SPECIAL AccouNT&#13;
2.50 The proposed Bank loan would be disbursed over a period of five years. The&#13;
project is expected to be completed by December 31, 2002, and the project's Closing Date&#13;
is June 30, 2003. The disbursement period shown in the projected Disbursement Schedule&#13;
(Annex I) is shorter than the Bank's standard disbursement profile for rural development&#13;
projects in Brazil, but is in line with the recent experience under the reformulated NRDP&#13;
and with other Bank-financed social fund projects in Latin America. The allocation of&#13;
loan proceeds by disbursement category is shown in Annex I.&#13;
2.51 During negotiations, assurances were provided by the State of Paraiba that it&#13;
would open and maintain a Special Account in US Dollars in a commercial bank for Bank&#13;
disbursements (para. 3.1(e)). The authorized allocation would be US$4.0 million,&#13;
adequate to cover the expected average four-month flow of disbursements under the&#13;
project. Disbursements for all expenditures would be made on the basis of statements of&#13;
expenditure (SOEs), except for goods and works exceeding US$100,000 equivalent;&#13;
contracts with consulting firms above US$100,000 equivalent; and with individuals above&#13;
US$50,000.&#13;
2.52 The information required for the compilation of SOEs would be maintained by the&#13;
PCU in the MIS data base. All SOEs would be transmitted by the PCU to the Bank in&#13;
Washington. Simultaneously, the PCU would send to the Bank's Recife Office a copy of&#13;
SOEs and reimbursement applications submitted to the Bank in Washington, as welt as&#13;
updated information on the status of all subprojects, enabling a rapid review of subproject&#13;
eligibility. This procedure would allow the Bank and the PCU management to maintain a&#13;
cumulative account of the progress of project implementation.&#13;
2.53  The communities' contributions to subproject investments would be defined in the&#13;
agreement (convWnio) between the PCU and the community association (for PAC),&#13;
between the PCU, the Municipal Council and the association (FUMAC) or between the&#13;
Municipal Council and the community association (FUMAC-P). Any contributions by&#13;
municipal governments would also be defined in the subproject agreements. Both&#13;
contributions would be computed as part of counterpart finance of the project. Simple,&#13;
standard records, whose format would be included in the Operational Manual, would be&#13;
completed by a designated community representative. They would be used to record cash&#13;
contributions, materials and labor inputs, and would be subject to project audit&#13;
procedures.&#13;
AccouNTs AND AUDITS&#13;
2.54 The PCU would maintain separate accounts for project expenditures, which would&#13;
be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. The accounts of the&#13;
Municipal Councils (for the FUMAC-P subcomponent) and of the community associations&#13;
would also be subject to review by the independent auditors on a sample basis. Finally,&#13;
independent auditors would also audit the Special Account (para. 2.51). Copies of the&#13;
audit reports would be provided to the Bank within six months of the end of each state&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
fiscal year. The audit reports would convey the auditor's opinion and comment as&#13;
necessary on the methodology employed in the compilation of the statements of&#13;
expenditure, their accuracy, the relevance of supporting documents, eligibility for&#13;
financing in terms of the project's legal agreements and standards of record keeping and&#13;
internal controls related to the foregoing. The State of ParaDba provided assurances&#13;
during negotiations that: (a) the Special Account and the project accounts would be&#13;
established, maintained and audited annually in accordance with appropriate auditing&#13;
principles, by independent auditors acceptable to the Bank; (b) with respect to&#13;
withdrawals on the basis of SOEs, that such audits would contain a separate opinion as to&#13;
whether the SOEs, together with the procedures involved in their preparation, support the&#13;
related withdrawals; and (c) certified copies of the audited accounts and of the auditors'&#13;
reports would be submitted to the Bank within six months of the close of each project&#13;
fiscal year (para. 3. 1(f)).&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
2.55  The proposed project has been assigned a "B" environmental classification.&#13;
Because of their relatively small size, most PAC, FUMAC, and FUMAC-P subprojects&#13;
would not have a significant effect on the environment. The project would, however,&#13;
ensure proper environmental screening and enforcement measures, to prevent certain types&#13;
of productive or infrastructure subprojects from producing negative effects on the&#13;
environment. The Operational Manual would specify key environmental criteria and&#13;
screening and enforcement procedures to be followed.&#13;
2.56 Based on specific criteria for different subproject types, each subproject proposal&#13;
presented by the community associations would include a simple environmental&#13;
assessment in the form of a "checklist", following a standard format. For standard&#13;
subproject types, enviromnental screening at the subproject approval stage would be the&#13;
responsibility of the PCU and Municipal Councils. For exceptional subproject types, for&#13;
which technical standards have not been developed, the PCU would screen the subproject&#13;
proposals in detail for enviromnental impact, contracting technical assistance when&#13;
necessary, and this assessment and any subsequent recommendations would be&#13;
incorporated into the subproject proposal. For the FUMAC-P subprojects, the Municipal&#13;
Councils would conduct the environmental screening together with either the PCU or with&#13;
contracted technical assistance, such as NGOs. The PCU has identified expertise within&#13;
the state for technical assistance purposes and would include environmental education and&#13;
awareness as part of its training to Municipal Councils. Enforcement of environmental&#13;
criteria would be ensured via subproject supervision by the PCU and Municipal Councils.&#13;
POVERTY CATEGORY&#13;
2.57 The proposed project is part of the Bank's Program of Targeted Interventions.&#13;
Project municipalities in Paraiba were determined based on poverty-related indicators and&#13;
other key parameters (see Annex C), which will ensure that project resources reach those&#13;
municipalities which contain a high concentration of rural poor. The project's targeting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
mechanism is then centered on community-based selection, with the assumption that local&#13;
communities can best judge what their investment priorities are in each municipality. In&#13;
particular, project Municipal Councils would be charged with targeting poor rural dwellers&#13;
and especially vulnerable groups, based on criteria including the socio-economic situation&#13;
of participating communities, their level of organization and the availability of&#13;
infrastructure and services. The transparency of rules and procedures for Municipal&#13;
Councils also would facilitate targeting under the project by permitting rural communities&#13;
to monitor local resource allocation decisions. Finally, communities which eventually are&#13;
determined to have capacity for sustainable asset-accumulation (savings) and access to&#13;
adequate social and economic infrastructure, would progressively be charged a higher&#13;
cost-sharing percentage and then would be graduated out of the program (para. 2.30).&#13;
WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION&#13;
2.58  The full participation of women is critical to the poverty objectives of the project.&#13;
Bank-supported operations and studies in the Northeast of Brazil show the strong&#13;
correlation between the problems and needs of rural women and those of producers and&#13;
flmily units in general. Under the reformulated NRDP in Paraiba, participation of women,&#13;
who accounted for about half of all project beneficiaries, was significant. The proposed&#13;
project would continue to ensure that women's activities (both traditional and innovative)&#13;
are included; to support subprojects which foster maternal/child health and day care&#13;
facilities (the latter have proven invaluable under the ongoing PAC/FUMAC operations in&#13;
freeing rural women for income generating activities); to target groups and activities in&#13;
which female participation has proven constructive; to provide technical assistance for&#13;
women's subproject proposals and implementation; and to monitor women's participation&#13;
in the project and its benefits.&#13;
PROJECr BENEFTrs&#13;
2.59 The proposed project would result in an improved quality of life for some 705,000&#13;
people (141,000 families) (about 60% of the target population), by providing improved&#13;
access to water supply and other basic social and economic infrastructure and services,&#13;
and by contributing to an increase in production, incomes and employment.10 Project-&#13;
financed rural water supply and minor irrigation works will be particularly important in&#13;
reducing vulnerability to drought. Productive subprojects will provide a vehicle for&#13;
financing improvements in input use, technology and value-adding activities, thus raising&#13;
productivity and incomes. Female community members will benefit especially from&#13;
subprojects such as water supply and some productive activities and social investments&#13;
which enable rural women to seek paying jobs and contribute to increased family cash&#13;
incomes.&#13;
10  Assumes 10% of the beneficiary families are "repeater" beneficiaries and benefit from more than one&#13;
subproject&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-34 -&#13;
2.60 The proposed project will provide a safety net for some of the poorest segments of&#13;
Paraiba's rural population who will likely continue to be affected by decreased public&#13;
investments for services during the period of fiscal adjustment and macroeconomic reform.&#13;
Another important project benefit will be the creation of social capital within rural&#13;
municipalities and their communities. Municipal councils established under the project will&#13;
direct the identification and prioritization of local needs and confirm potential subproject&#13;
feasibility and compatibility with these priorities. Community resources, both financial and&#13;
in-kind, will be leveraged to achieve desired improvements in quality of life and access to&#13;
market channels. It is expected that the new project will have a similar impact on the&#13;
mobilization of additional community and municipal resources, as did the reformulated&#13;
NRDP (about 15% of resources invested under the program), and this will improve the&#13;
longer-term sustainability of investments. Project-related benefits can potentially generate&#13;
savings for state and municipal governments as well by reducing certain budgetary&#13;
obligations to rural areas, such as emergency water supply through water trucks (carros&#13;
pipa) or medical services. Finally, as a result of benefits from the project which lead to an&#13;
overall improvement in community organization and well-being and capacity to save, it is&#13;
expected that a small number of beneficiary communities will graduate from the project&#13;
and gain access to alternative sources of financing.&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND FISCAL IMPACT&#13;
2.61  The demand-driven nature of the project implies that communities will determine&#13;
the nature and scope of each subproject funded and that neither benefits nor costs can be&#13;
identified ex ante, thereby prohibiting estimation of an ex ante overall internal economic&#13;
rate of return. Subprojects to be funded under the proposed project would, in general, be&#13;
similar to those subprojects funded and completed under the reformulated NRDP. To&#13;
give an illustrative idea of the financial and economic results that are likely to be obtained&#13;
under the proposed project, the experience and expost results of a sample of completed&#13;
subprojects under the NRDP have been examined and presented in Annex J.&#13;
2.62  Infrastructure and social subprojects were analyzed on the basis of least cost, best&#13;
alternative criteria. First, the demand-driven nature of each subproject permits scarce&#13;
resources to flow where they are most needed, thereby improving allocative efficiency.&#13;
Community participation, under the direction of the municipal councils created under the&#13;
project, ensure that the chosen subproject is the best alternative for the local community.&#13;
Second, the use of standard technical designs, including cost parameters, for the most&#13;
common types of subprojects ensures that least cost models are adopted and decreases&#13;
search and information costs by providing communities with established patterns of&#13;
initiating and completing a subproject. Third, the contracting procedures prescribed in the&#13;
Project Operational Manual require competitive bidding on all subprojects; the community&#13;
solicits three bids for the subproject and subsequently chooses the least-cost bid. Finally,&#13;
subprojects executed by the communities themselves have been shown to be more cost&#13;
effective than if they had been undertaken by the public sector (for details and examples,&#13;
see Annex B).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
2.63 Financial and economic analyses were conducted on the following sample of&#13;
productive subprojects in Paraiba: (a) electricity-induced irrigation, (b) forage grinder, (c)&#13;
cereals processing, (d) productive irrigation, and (e) small ruminants production.&#13;
Financial IRRs for all subprojects evaluated were satisfactory and ranged from 12% (small&#13;
ruminants production) to over 50% (productive irrigation and forage grinders). Economic&#13;
IRRs were highly positive and, in most cases, greater than the financial IRRs due to the&#13;
proportion of nonmonetary benefits accruing from the subproject. lERRs ranged from&#13;
38% (small ruminants production) to over 50% (electricity-induced irrigation, forage&#13;
grinders, cereals processing and productive irrigation). Various sensitivity analyses were&#13;
undertaken (e.g., by shadowing public funds), producing satisfactory EERR results.&#13;
2.64 Cost effectiveness was examined by estimation of benefit-cost ratios for each&#13;
productive subproject and investment per job created. Benefit-cost ratios range from 1.7&#13;
(productive irrigation) to more than 5.0 (forage grinders). Additionally, the financial&#13;
sustainability of selected productive subprojects was evaluated by examining (a) cost&#13;
recovery measures undertaken by each subproject and (b) the replacement period for&#13;
initial capital equipment. In some cases, user fees are assessed to cover O&amp;M expenses&#13;
and contribute toward the eventual replacement of capital equipment; in others, cost&#13;
recovery takes the form of subproject revenues (e.g., goat milk and meat sales, marketed&#13;
produce). For all subprojects evaluated, cost recovery was sufficient to cover O&amp;M&#13;
expenses and replacement periods for capital equipment were substantially less than the&#13;
useful economic life of the equipment.&#13;
2.65  The fiscal impact of the project will derive from two sources: (a) cost savings&#13;
and (b) revenue generation. Experience has shown that local communities can undertake&#13;
and complete these small-scale subprojects at a lower total cost that is possible through&#13;
the public sector. For example, the rural electrification network installed by the NRDP in&#13;
1995 alone was equivalent to that which was developed through other programs by the&#13;
previous State Government over a four-year period. In another example, NRDP water&#13;
supply subprojects have minimized the need for water delivery via tanker trucks (carro&#13;
pipa); based on conservative estimates, cost savings related to these water subprojects&#13;
range, for all participating states, from US$7 million in a year of normal precipitation to&#13;
US$15 million in a drought year. Surveys in many states indicate that infrastructure&#13;
projects are, on average, about 30% less expensive when implemented by the communities&#13;
(i.e., demand-driven) than by government agencies or contractors. Thus, by decentralizing&#13;
toward the community level, the state can achieve costs reductions which in turn will&#13;
allow reallocation of scarce public finance to other pressing needs. On the revenue side,&#13;
the demand-driven nature of the project precludes the ex ante estimation of fiscal&#13;
revenues; however, experiences accumulated under the reformulated NRDP can shed light&#13;
on any potential changes in public sector fiscal balances which may result from the project.&#13;
Expanded commodity production under the majority of the productive subprojects&#13;
evaluated can potentially generate additional public revenues through taxation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-36 -&#13;
PROJECT RJUSKS&#13;
2.66  Baik expeence in Latin America and elsewhere suggests that the main sources of&#13;
risk for this type of program arise from: (a) irregular counterpart funding, which can&#13;
erode community confidence and interest in participating; (b) technical weaknesses and&#13;
inadequate supervision of large numbers of widely dispersed subprojects; (c) mistargeting&#13;
of program resources; and (d) undue political interference in subproject selection, which&#13;
often has the corollary effect of depressing local initiative and community involvement.&#13;
The funding risk will be mitigated by several distinguishing features of the projects. The&#13;
Bank loan, which will finance 75% of total project expenditures, will be taken directly by&#13;
the State, thereby eliminating those disbursement delays previously encountered at the&#13;
Federal level and minimzig the overall counterpart funding obligation of the State. In&#13;
addition, counterpart funding responsibilities would be shared to a larger extent by the&#13;
municipalities, decreasing the relative proportion of the State's own participation, and,&#13;
unlike in the reformulated NRDP, beneficiary contributions under the proposed project&#13;
will be counted toward the global counterpart requirements. The project will also help&#13;
address the State's fiscal deficit situation with technical assistance funds for administrative&#13;
reforms, thereby reducing the risk of counterpart funding difficulties. Finally, and perhaps&#13;
most importantly, the strong sense of ownership by the State, municipalities and&#13;
communities should help to protect project counterpart funding needs during the process&#13;
of allocating scarce budget resources. The risks of overdesign and weak supervision at&#13;
the subproject level would be substantially reduced with the establishment of standard&#13;
technical designs and cost criteria for the most common types of subprojects, and a&#13;
reinforced institutional strengthening component with specific resources allocated to&#13;
technical assistance for community associations. Increased delegation of supervision&#13;
responsibilities by the PCU to Municipal Councils and contracted public and non-&#13;
governmental agencies, will increase supervision coverage and will minimize the risk of&#13;
mistargeting of program resources. In addition, the project design has introduced a&#13;
system of strong operational disincentives against mistargeting and other departures from&#13;
project guidelines. For instance, a community or municipality would be obligated to&#13;
redress the problem, or be cut off entirely from the program, in cases of misappropriation,&#13;
mistargeting or insufficient participation. Finally, an information campaign targeted to&#13;
potential beneficiaries and the expansion of the FUMAC and FUMAC-P programs, will&#13;
stimulate greater community participation and increase transparency in the selection of&#13;
subprojects and thereby work against negative political influence in the allocation of&#13;
project resources.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT - PARAIBA&#13;
A. PARAIBA: A SOCIO-ECONOMIC PROFILE&#13;
Geography and Cimate&#13;
1.    The State of Paraiba occupies an area of 56,372 km2 in the eastern part of the&#13;
Brazilian Northeast. It is bordered on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, and on the north,&#13;
west and south, respectively, by the states of Rio Grande do Norte, Pernambuco and&#13;
Ceara. The State displays considerable variation in its agro-climatic composition, with&#13;
most of its territory lying within the semi-arid "drought polygon" characterized by poor&#13;
soils and severe, periodic drought. The semi-arid Sertdo region covers about 77% of the&#13;
State, has an average annual rainfll of 500 mm, which is irregularly distributed, and a long&#13;
dry season of seven to ten months. Soils are generally shallow and impermeable. Along&#13;
the coast, the Litoral-Mata, comprising about 9% of the State, has a more humid climate&#13;
with an average annual rainfall of 1,800 mm and fertile soils. Between these two major&#13;
geo-economic regions lies the Agreste-Brejo, which includes an elevated inland region of&#13;
fertile soils and a range of transitional zones. This area covers about 14% of the State's&#13;
territory, with total annual rainfall of 800-900 mm and four to five dry months. The State&#13;
is drained by two major rivers (Paraiba and Piranhas), both with a perennial flow.&#13;
Underground water is plentifil on the coast, but generally very deep and of poor quality in&#13;
the interior.&#13;
Demographic and Social Situation&#13;
2.    The population of the state is currently estimated at about 3.4 million, of which&#13;
some 65% is urban and 35% rural.' Between the two censuses of 1980 and 1991, the&#13;
population grew at around 1.3% per year, compared to 1.8% for the Northeast and 1.9%&#13;
for Brazil overall. The average annual rate of growth was 3.2% for the urban population&#13;
and -1.3% for the rural population. Outmigration over the past two decades has caused a&#13;
continuous decline in the rural population.&#13;
3.    As in other states in the Northeast, Paraiba has witnessed an increase in the total&#13;
number of poor among its population, stemming from low growth and economic&#13;
instability. Public policies have failed to promote poverty reduction because of an inability&#13;
to stabilize the economy and promote broad-based growth, an incentive framework&#13;
detrimental to the poor, and insufficient and ineffective investments in human capital, such&#13;
1996 estimtes by the State Secretariat of Planning.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40 -                            Annex A&#13;
as education or safety nets for the poor. Thus, the State has failed to either eradicate the&#13;
root causes of poverty or alleviate its consequences (World Bank, 1995). These&#13;
deficiencies in public policy disproportionately affect the rural population, whose&#13;
livelihood is also more vulnerable to economic forces and natural phenomena. The&#13;
modermization of the industrial base, falling prices of basic food crops in international&#13;
markets, technical innovation, concentration of landholdings and periodic droughts and&#13;
pest outbreaks all contribute to suppress the income and employment of the rural poor.&#13;
4.    The increasingly limited prospects for the rural population inevitably result in rural-&#13;
urban migration, including migration to other parts of the country. Because of a declining&#13;
labor market nationwide, local urban centers have been the main destination for the&#13;
unskilled work force uprooted from the countryside. In the span of 25 years, the rate of&#13;
urbanization in Paraiba increased from 42% to 64%. The growing supply of unskilled&#13;
labor, coupled with a decreasing demand resulting from technological advances in&#13;
production methods, creates a tremendous burden for rural municipal centers, which&#13;
become the first stopping-off point, and ultimately for larger cities and the state and&#13;
federal governments. This dislocation of population, without a corresponding increase in&#13;
public investment in infrastructure, leads to a disorganized occupation of urban space,&#13;
aggravating socio-economic conditions and having an adverse effect on the urban&#13;
landscape, the quality of life and the environment. At the same time, production is being&#13;
abandoned in the rural zones, where the rate of outmigration in certain areas threatens to&#13;
leave them unoccupied in the near future, contributing further to the concentration of non-&#13;
productive lands as well as to the dismantling of small farms, which become unsuitable&#13;
even for subsistence fanning. The continued neglect of rural areas and populations&#13;
essentially means that neither rural nor urban poverty can be reduced.&#13;
5.    Paraiba has been classified, in the most recent report on indices of human&#13;
development prepared by IPEA for UNDP, at the lowest end of the scale among all the&#13;
states in Brazil. IPEA estimates that by 1990 about 1.5 million people or 47% of the state&#13;
population, was indigent.2 In the rural areas, the proportion of indigence rises to 72%.&#13;
According to a joint study by UNICEF and IBGE, 85% of the State's municipalities&#13;
harbor very precarious living conditions critically affecting rates of childhood survival.&#13;
Unhealthy living conditions stem from an inadequate infrastructure and a lack of basic&#13;
education or income-generating activities needed to overcome poverty, a situation which&#13;
becomes especially acute in the rural zones.3 The indicators of quality of life attest to the&#13;
severity of poverty in the State: (a) while 52% of urban heads of households earn less&#13;
than one minimum salary (currently about US$120 per month), this rises to 81% in rural&#13;
areas; (b) inadequate water supply affects 24% of urban families, and 95% of rural&#13;
families; (c) while 14% of urban families lack any form of sanitation, this increases to 73%&#13;
2 lndigence is defined as the level of income that corresponds, at the maximum, to the value of a "basic&#13;
food basket" that meets a family's minimum nutritional requirements as defined by FAO/WHO.&#13;

contributes to a high incidence of Chagas disease, while water-borne diseases such as&#13;
verminose (worms), schistosomiasis and leshmaniosis are also prevalent, reducing life&#13;
expectancy.&#13;
The State Economy&#13;
6.    In the last few decades, the economy of Paraiba has experienced a major&#13;
transformation characterized by a decline in traditional commercial crops, an expansion&#13;
and consolidation of the industries producing perishable consumer goods:and an&#13;
accelerated process of income concentration. The restructuring of the-agro-industrial base&#13;
has increased the vulnerability of agricultural production, which remains particularly&#13;
susceptible to natural phenomena and to market fluctuations. As a result, the relative&#13;
contribution of the agricultural sector has been declining steadily. Whereas the service&#13;
sector has expanded, generating 64% of the State's GDP in 1995 compared to a&#13;
contribution of 48% in 1970, the participation of the agricultural sector has witnessed a&#13;
relative decline from 24% in 1970 to 11% in 1995.i In spite of its reduced contribution to&#13;
State production, the agro-livestock sector still employs about one-third of all manual&#13;
labor, a discrepancy which points to one of the primary causes of rural poverty in this&#13;
state.&#13;
7.    Although its GDP has been growing at an average annual rate of 2.6% since 1990,&#13;
Paraiba is one of only three states in the Northeast --along with Bahia and Pemambuco-&#13;
whose relative contribution to the region's GDP has dropped during the last 25 years.&#13;
The State generated a GDP of US$6.8 billion in 1995, corresponding to 6.8% of total&#13;
GDP for the Northeast, and 1.1% at the national level. Paraiba is also among the lowest-&#13;
ranking states in the region in terms of per capita GDP, which was registered at US$2,028&#13;
in 1995, compared with US$2,236 for the Northeast and US$4,054 for Brazil as a whole.&#13;
Because of its weak productive base, Paraiba depends heavily on transfers from the&#13;
Federal Government, which amounted to about 50% of the State's total revenues in 1995.&#13;
Collection of the value-added tax ICMS accounted for 46% of total revenues, contributing&#13;
about 6% of the ICMS levied in the Northeast.6&#13;
4  These are offcial rates which do not capture the real situation owing to the high percentage of both&#13;
births and deaths which are never registered, especially in rual areas.&#13;

The Agricultural Sector&#13;
8.    An important contributing factor to rural poverty in Paraiba is the skewed&#13;
distribution of agricultural land. The Agricultural Census of 1985 demonstrates that small&#13;
farms under 10 ha account for some 73% of all farm establishments, but only 8% of&#13;
farmland; moving up the scale to farms of 100 ha or less, the percentage rises to 95% of&#13;
total farm estabishments and 36% of fannland.7 Conversely, close to 5% of farms control&#13;
64% of the farmland.' The increase in large-scale commercial farming implies the&#13;
probability of even greater concentration of landholdings in the decade since the last&#13;
Census. As in the rest of the Northeast, perverse incentives limit access of the poor to&#13;
land, even on a temporary basis. For example, legislation on renting and sharecropping,&#13;
typical forms of temporary access to land, sets ceilings on rents and crop shares, providing&#13;
almost permanent rights to tenants after a few years but making such arrangements&#13;
unattractive to owners and reducing access for those the law was intended to protect.&#13;
Similarly, agricultural land is a tax haven for wealthy investors, thus increasing its price&#13;
and reducing access for the smallholders and landless workers unable to take advantage of&#13;
tax laws.9 The increasing concentration of income and wealth promotes the exploitation of&#13;
labor and prevents the results of economic growth from benefiting the majority of the&#13;
population.&#13;
9.    The sectoral economy is closely related to the State's varied geography.&#13;
Agriculture in the humid coastal zones has been dominated by traditional colonial crops,&#13;
principally sugar cane. In the semi-arid regions, the larger farmers engage in extensive&#13;
livestock grazing, while their tenants and owners of small farms grow cotton and basic&#13;
foodcrops (manioc, corn, beans and rice). Conforming to regional patterns, yields&#13;
fluctuate greatly due to the impact of erratic climate, insecure land tenure, the poor natural&#13;
resource base, inability to purchase inputs or to store water, intensive cropping on&#13;
unsuitable lands, and generally low levels of technology. The rural poor, most of whom&#13;
are smallholders, sharecroppers or wageworkers, must therefore rely on several sources&#13;
for income: traditional subsistence agriculture and small-scale animal husbandry, cash&#13;
crops, casual work on- and off-farm and remittances from family members living in cities.&#13;
10.   Major changes in the economy of the State during the past few decades have&#13;
further weakened the fragile base of agricultural production, with a negative impact on the&#13;
rural poor. Modernized production methods and regional development policies, in&#13;
common with trends in other parts of Brazil, contributed to the establishment of consumer&#13;
goods industries with little or no dependence on local production. The resulting&#13;
disruption in the traditional productive chain of the State neutralized the export potential&#13;
7 Given the poor soils and rainfall of the semi-anid northeast, the productive capacity of a fann of less&#13;
than 100 ha, in the absence of inputs, classifies it as 'small'.&#13;

of local industries based on livestock and cotton, such as clothes-making and shoe&#13;
manufacturing. In addition, the prices of basic food crops in the international markets&#13;
declined due to the rise of more competitive economies and of synthetic products used as&#13;
substitutes. Basic food crops also could not compete with products imported from other&#13;
regions, which came to occupy a privileged position in the supply of the main centers of&#13;
consumption in the State. The production of cotton has suffered throughout the&#13;
Northeast from a combination of declining prices, competition from synthetics and credit&#13;
access problems, firther aggravated by the arrival of the bicudo pest in the early 1980s.&#13;
This decline has serious implications for the poorer segments of the rural population, who&#13;
have traditionally depended on cotton as a principal source of cash income. Average rural&#13;
income per capita now corresponds to about one-third of that for urban areas.&#13;
State Government Strategy to Alleviate Poverty&#13;
11.  In its Plan for Sustainable Development, the State Government of Paraiba aims to&#13;
decentralize the economic base of the State and reduce the problems of rural-urban&#13;
migration stemming from the impoverished situation in rural areas. With regard to the&#13;
rural sector, the State's strategy focuses on: (a) regional integration of economic activity&#13;
which recognizes differences in ecosystems and expands on existing infrastructure; (b)&#13;
creation and diffusion of technical innovations geared towards local production needs and&#13;
capabilities; (c) implementation of policies that make maximum use of local potential,&#13;
particularly water resources, to curtail the abandonment of productive activities and&#13;
migration to the cities; (d) land reform initiatives based on consolidation and&#13;
intensification of rural settlements; and (e) expanded access to basic services for the rural&#13;
population. The NRDP has been one of the State's most important tools for promoting&#13;
organized decentralization, local development and community participation, through the&#13;
establishment of municipal councils which generate concrete investment proposals for&#13;
economic and social infrastructure and local employment and income creation.&#13;
Experiences with Bank-Financed Development Programs&#13;
12.   The history of the State's involvement with Bank-financed rural development&#13;
programs is consistent with that of the other northeastern states: under&#13;
POLONORDESTE the Brejo Paraibano Integrated Rural Development Project (Loan&#13;
1537-BR) met its physical targets, but implementation and disbursement delays occurred&#13;
due to Federal counterpart funding and rural credit problems, drought, over-centralized&#13;
project administration and limited beneficiary participation in project planning and&#13;
execution. Poor coordination, duplication of effort and competition for scarce funds were&#13;
also key factors. However, the project did strengthen state institutional capabilities,&#13;
established services and infrastructure which contributed to agricultural modernization,&#13;
and laid the groundwork for further rural development programs.&#13;
13.   The Northeast Rural Development Program (NRDP), initiated between 1985 and&#13;
1987, was largely unable to improve on the performance of POLONORDESTE but did&#13;
successfully launch the community-based rural development methodology through the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44-                            Annex A&#13;
small APCR component. The NRDP-Para'ba experience conformed to this pattern and,&#13;
like POLONORDESTE, also made other important contributions: it paved the way for&#13;
administrative decentralization, a more strategic approach to rural development, the&#13;
involvement ofNGOs and i greater role for communities in project planning and&#13;
execution. The NRDP projects in each of the northeast states were reformulated in 1993&#13;
by essentially converting the successful APCR component into the primary model for&#13;
development.&#13;
14.   The performance of Paraiba under the reformulated NRDP has been generally&#13;
successful. As a demonstration of its commitment to the project, the State Government,&#13;
along with the participating municipalities under the FUMAC subprogram, has made an&#13;
extraordinary effort to release the required counterpart funds, despite its current fiscal&#13;
difficulties. In addition, the State has made great strides to expand the FUMAC&#13;
subprogram - almost 50% of all subprojects approved, the highest proportion among the&#13;
participating states - and to involve the municipalities in a positive way in project&#13;
implementation, through the respective Municipal Councils. Before the installation of a&#13;
Municipal Council, the Technical Unit (Unidade Tecnica do Projeto Cooperar-Paratba)&#13;
carries out a workshop involving Municipal Government authorities, NGOs and State and&#13;
community representatives to discuss project roles and procedures and FUMAC&#13;
guidelines. As a consequence, these Councils are playing a crucial role in the process of&#13;
setting community priorities and in overseeing the implementation of the subprojects in&#13;
their respective jurisdictions.&#13;
15.   The NRDP-Paraiba project closed on December 31, 1996, nine months after the&#13;
original Closing Date. Of the original NRDP loan of US$60 million for Paraiba, signed on&#13;
July 20, 1987, US$21.4 million had been disbursed at the time of reformulation. Since&#13;
then, another US$38.0 million have been disbursed, leaving an estimated balance of&#13;
US$0.6 million to be canceled. The rate of disbursements improved resoundingly after the&#13;
NRDP reformulation: prior to reformulation, the NRDP-Paraiba project disbursed an&#13;
average of US$4.2 million annually and after reformulation this rate jumped to US$11.7&#13;
million. By the Closing Date, beneficiary communities had submitted some 4,924&#13;
proposals, of which 2,308 were financed, almost double the number forecast at&#13;
reformulation. Of these subprojects, 74% were for infrastructure investments, 23% were&#13;
for productive activities and about 3% were for social investments. These investments&#13;
benefited about 150,000 rural families in 171 municipalities, exceeding appraisal estimates&#13;
and well over four times the number anticipated at project reformulation (see Annex B for&#13;
details).&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT - PARAIBA&#13;
THE REFORMULATED NORTHEAST RURAL&#13;
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM (NRDP):&#13;
PERFORMANCE AND EVALUATION&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    Northeast Brazil, containing more than half of the country's poor and almost two-thirds of&#13;
its rural poor, has long been considered the single largest rural poverty pocket in Latin America.'&#13;
Coupled with Brazil's increasingly difficult macroeconomic situation in the two decades following&#13;
the 1970s, poverty remained unabated in the Northeast despite a series of rural development&#13;
programs -- including the Bank-supported Northeast Rural Development Program (NRDP),&#13;
which aimed to improve living standards of small farm families and reduce poverty through&#13;
individual projects established between 1985 and 1987 in the ten Northeast states. For several&#13;
years, implementation of the NRDP lagged behind schedule and overall performance in meeting&#13;
basic objectives was poor. One notable exception was a component supporting small community&#13;
projects, Apoio as Pequenas Comunidades Rurais (APCR). This innovative component, relying&#13;
on the planning and organization of rural communities and recognizing their expressed needs,&#13;
produced results that were extremely encouraging and replicable. The impact of the APCR on&#13;
poverty alleviation was positive, the cost per family relatively low, and its disbursement and&#13;
commitment rates far exceeded those of other components. In 1993, drawing both on the&#13;
successful experience of the APCR and on lessons learned with similar schemes in other parts of&#13;
Latin America, the Federal Government, jointly with the Bank, reformulated the NRDP in its&#13;
entirety into a community-based development program. Concomitant with the administrative and&#13;
fiscal decentralization embodied in the new Brazilian constitution of 1988, a significant feature of&#13;
the reformulation was to decentralize decision-making, program counterpart funding and&#13;
implementation from the Federal Government to the States and local levels.&#13;
2.    Effective in late 1993, the reformulated NRDP provided matching grants to finance small-&#13;
scale subprojects (up to US$40,000) that were identified by rural community associations as&#13;
priority investments to improve their well-being. These groups contributed to the costs of the&#13;
subprojects, executed them, and were committed contractually to assume their operation and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M). Two different delivery mechanisms were available for screening, approving&#13;
and implementing community subprojects: (a) State Community Schemes (PAC) in which rural&#13;
communities submitted their subproject investment proposals directly to the state Project&#13;
The Northeast Region includes the States of Maranhao, Piaui, Ceari, Rio Grande do Norte, Paraiba,&#13;
Perambuco, Alagoas, Sergipe, Bahia and the northern part of the State of Minas Gerais.&#13;

Technical Unit (TU), an autonomous entity responsible --in most cases-- to the State Secretariat&#13;
of Plnning. The TU screened, approved and released funds for subprojects, interacting directly&#13;
with the beneficianes; and (b) Pilot Municipal Community Schemes (FUMAC), in which&#13;
subproject proposals, simlarly identified and prepared by rural communities, were first screened&#13;
and reviewed by project Municipal Councils. The Councils, composed of community members,&#13;
local government representatives and representatives of civil society, promoted local-level&#13;
consensus-building on priority needs through open "town meetings", reviewed and submitted&#13;
subprojects to the State for subsequent approval and financing. This pilot was originally designed&#13;
to reach only 5 to 10 municipalities per state but, due to its early success, largely surpassed its&#13;
initial target to reach a total of 168 municipalities in the ten states. Of the last four loans, the&#13;
NRDP-Alagoas closed on September 30, 1996 and those for Paraiba, Maranhao and Minas Gerais&#13;
onDecember 31, 1996.&#13;
3.    This Annex presents a performance and impact analysis of the approximately three years&#13;
of implementation of the reformulated NRDP, as a result of an evaluation carried out by the Bank&#13;
and FAO (United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization) in late 1996, subsequently updated&#13;
during appraisal of the proposed Rural Poverty Alleviation Project for Paraiba. Certain aspects of&#13;
the analysis, based on the latest information from NRDP's Simplified Project Monitoring System&#13;
(SSMP) and State databases as well as findings of earlier studies, cover the overall program in the&#13;
ten participating states. Other aspects, such as the project institutional performance and the&#13;
socio-econoinic impact of subproject investments on beneficiaries, have been analyzed specifically&#13;
for the State of Paraiba. Featured below are: (a) the information base used for the evaluation; (b)&#13;
implemeaion results, in terms of subprojects and loan disbursements, in each of the states; (c) an&#13;
impact analysis of the reformulated NRDP at the state and municipal levels for the program as a whole,&#13;
and at the local level for Paraiba (d) comparative results of FUMAC and PAC, the two delivery&#13;
nmechanim available in the NRDP; (e) a technical assessment of subprojects; (f) an assessment of&#13;
institutional performance in the program as a whole, and more specifically in Paraiba; and (g)&#13;
conclusions and recommendations for design improvements in follow-on operations.&#13;
4.    Results of this and previous evaluations of the reformulated NRDP tend to indicate that,&#13;
after several decades of experience with rural development efforts in the Northeast, a large&#13;
measure of success has been achieved with this program in reaching the rural poor through&#13;
targeted interventions. Further modifications to project design and operational features would,&#13;
however, enhance the effectiveness and sustainability of such an approach. The design of&#13;
successor projects should explicitly take into account the lessons derived from the different NRDP&#13;
evaluations, which are consistent in many respects with lessons learned elsewhere in Latin&#13;
America and other regions with similar community-based development programs.&#13;

IMPLEMENTATION RESULTS&#13;
Subprojects and Beneficiaries&#13;
6.    Statistical information --compiled from the SSMP and State databases-- on the&#13;
performance of each of the participating states at closing date of the last NRDP loans is presented&#13;
in Tables 1 to 6. Out of a total of about 46,500 subproject proposals submitted by potential&#13;
beneficiaries in the ten states following reformulation, some 17,860 community subprojects were&#13;
implemented, of which about 14,150 under PAC and 3,710 under FUMAC. In Paratba, 2,308&#13;
subprojects were funded (1,455 PAC and 853 FUJMAC) out of the approximately 4,920 proposals&#13;
received from communities in the state (Table 1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48 -                        Annex B&#13;
7.    During its 3 years of implementation, the reformulated NRDP reached about 1.8 million&#13;
poor families in rural areas across the Northeast. With community subproject investments totaling&#13;
about US$424 million in the ten states, the delivery cost of the program was remarkably low at&#13;
less than US$250 per beneficiary family. These recipient families include an estimated 10 to 200/%&#13;
"repeater" families which benefited from more than one subproject, belonging to different types of&#13;
investments. Such families form part of community associations which typically are better&#13;
organized than others, usually with support from NGOs and/or other technical assistance&#13;
agencies. The gradual accumulation by some of the target population of benefits and assets from&#13;
different NRDP subprojects as well as from other programs has a significant impact on&#13;
community development. It would constitute an important element of a strategy to graduate&#13;
some of the NRDP recipients into other, non grant-based programs (paras. 18-19).&#13;
8.    Throughout the ten participating states, some 100 different types of subprojects were&#13;
proposed by rural communities. A large majority of these constituted basic rural infrastructure&#13;
(such as electrification and water supply), followed by productive subprojects (mostly small-scale&#13;
agro-processing and communal tractors) and, to a lesser extent, investments of a social nature&#13;
(such as day care centers or house improvement). Table 2 shows community demand for the&#13;
most common types of subprojects for the NRDP as a whole, and separately for the states of&#13;
Paruaba, Maranhao, Minas Gerais and Alagoas. It is clear that in all participating states, rural&#13;
electrification and water supply were by far the most popular types of investments. The profile of&#13;
the subprojects financed was in line with community demand: out of the total number of&#13;
subprojects that had been implemented in the 10 states as of late 1996, about 61% were in rural&#13;
infrastructure, 33% productive investments and 6% social subprojects (Table 1). In Paraiba,&#13;
communities exhibited a higher than average preference for infrastructure subprojects (74% of the&#13;
total implemented), with 23% devoted to directly productive investments and about 3% for social&#13;
subprojects; the latter were in relatively scarce demand under the NRDP as other state programs&#13;
were available, and continue to exist, to provide social investments that were requested by rural&#13;
communities in other states, such as rural school or health post rehabilitation. The state itself&#13;
encouraged communities to orient NRDP investments towards infrastructure and in particular&#13;
rural electrification (55% of all subprojects financed), not only because these improve living&#13;
conditions of rural communities but also because they can lead to a variety of productive&#13;
undertakings that help raise communities' incomes considerably (see Annex J).&#13;
9.    Although FUMAC was initially to be implemented on a pilot basis, it quickly gained in&#13;
popularity with communities and municipal authorities and was expanded towards the end of the&#13;
project implementation period to reach over 20% of all NRDP subprojects approved in the ten&#13;
states (Table 1). Moreover, demonstrating that screening of subprojects at local level accelerates&#13;
processing, FUMAC had a greater number of community investments approved per municipality&#13;
than PAC: on average in the participating states, some 22 subprojects were implemented per&#13;
municipality under FUMAC, compared with only 11 under PAC. This difference was particularly&#13;
striking for Paraiba, where the success of FUMAC and organizational efficiency of FUMAC&#13;
Municipal Councils were such that an average of 34 subprojects were processed and approved in&#13;
each of the 25 FUMAC municipalities, while the 155 PAC municipalities benefited from only&#13;
about 9 subprojects each (Table 3). Understandably, Paraiba achieved, among the ten states, the&#13;
highest proportion of FUMAC subprojects (37% of all subprojects approved in the state) while&#13;
Alagoas found itself at the other extreme, having only about 8% of all subprojects implemented&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49 -                        Annex B&#13;
under FUMAC. Indeed, depending on the local socio-political situation, conditions favorable to&#13;
the FUMAC process, as promoted under NRDP, differ from state to state. Thus, if this delivery&#13;
mechanism was more prevalent and successful in Paraiba, where a long existing tradition of&#13;
community organization and participation is backed by a favorable political environment and the&#13;
TU's sustained efforts at commuunity mobilization and training, FUMAC was extremely limited in&#13;
Alagoas due to the difficult political circumstances in this state.&#13;
10.   For the ten states as a whole, subprojects costs were similar for PAC and FUMAC,&#13;
averaging about US$24,000 per subproject (Table 4). In Paraiba subproject costs were markedly&#13;
lower than in other states, especially for infrastructure and productive subprojects and more&#13;
particularly so under FUMAC. One possible reason is that FUMAC communities in this state&#13;
tended to request financing for small, lower cost investments in order to obtain as many&#13;
subprojects as possible. Whether PAC or FUMAC, infrastructure and social subprojects generally&#13;
benefited larger numbers of people than productive subprojects, and thus tended to have lower&#13;
costs per beneficiary. The average cost per subproject varied among investment types, ranging&#13;
from about US$14,800 for manioc flour mills to about US$30,000 for communal farm tractors&#13;
(Table 5). Within each type, costs could vary substantially from one state to the other depending&#13;
on the specific nature and technical requirements of the subproject.&#13;
Loan Disbursements&#13;
11.   Final analysis of loan disbursements shows that the NRDP's overall disbursement rate was&#13;
significantly higher than its historical equivalent before reformulation (Table 6). In just over three&#13;
years a total of US$338.6 million of loan funds was disbursed under the reformulated program&#13;
(ate 1993 to end-1996), as compared to only US$302.1 million during the entire implementation&#13;
period of the original NRDP (1985-late 1993). It should also be noted that municipalities in states&#13;
like Maranhio and Paraiba frequently contributed to counterpart funds, in light of shortages at the&#13;
state level. For the program as a whole, it is estimated that 93% of project funds disbursed&#13;
reached the beneficiary communities directly, as compared with only 44% under the original&#13;
NRDP. An outstanding loan balance of US$0.6 million for Paraiba remains to be canceled.&#13;
IMPACT EVALUATION&#13;
State and Municipal Levels&#13;
12.   Based on conservative estimates derived from SSMP data and information provided by the&#13;
state TUs, there is ample evidence to show that the reformulated NRDP was cost-effective in&#13;
attending to the rural poor in the Northeast. First, it delivered low-cost basic infrastructure and&#13;
services that would have constituted a larger burden on State and Municipal Government budgets,&#13;
had they been executed on force account rather than by the communities themselves. Given the&#13;
fiscal difficulties faced by most of these govemnments, such investments and services would&#13;
probably have required a longer timeframe to complete than through the NRDP. Second, the&#13;
rural water supply structures that were put in place by the program are providing water to&#13;
beneficiary communities on a more permanent and wider basis, substituting in these areas for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50 -                       Annex B&#13;
annual and/or extraordinary expenditures that municipalities and States have traditionally had to&#13;
incur to reduce the effects of often severe and protracted drought on their rural communities.&#13;
Third, on the revenue side, those NRDP-financed productive subprojects that generate surplus&#13;
agricultural produce (including high-value and industrial crops) and non-agricultural commodities&#13;
(such as clothes), can add to State and municipal tax revenue when their outputs are sold in&#13;
formal markets.&#13;
13.   With respect to construction costs, surveys in many states have demonstrated that&#13;
infrastructure projects are, on average, about 30% less expensive when they are implemented by&#13;
the communities themselves (directly or through small local firms) than by government agencies&#13;
or contractors. For example, a detailed survey conducted by the TU in Maranhao plainly show&#13;
that unit costs of NRDP investments in this state were much lower than those executed by a&#13;
public agency: for rural water supply systems, NRDP costs were, on average, US$23,000 as&#13;
compared to US$32,000 when the system is installed by CAEMA, the state water and sewage&#13;
company; for rural electrification, NRDP costs --depending on the type of network-- ranged&#13;
between US$3,750 and US$17, 100 per km against US$6,300-US$19,400 per km as charged by&#13;
the state electricity company (CEMAR); and for rural road rehabilitation, the cost was US$6,000&#13;
per km under NRDP as compared to US$9,700 per km when the works are executed by the state&#13;
Roads Department. Conservatively assuming that half of all community subprojects financed by&#13;
the reformulated NRDP were effectively 30% cheaper than if they had been implemented by&#13;
public agencies, total savings in this regard for the Northeast State governments would be the&#13;
equivalent of US$64 million (the total investment cost of the approximately 17,860 subprojects&#13;
implemented under the program, as shown in Table 1, amounts to about US$424 million).&#13;
Another example of the extent to which the NRDP substituted for costlier state programs is the&#13;
fact that in Paraiba, the rural electrification network installed by the NRDP in 1995 alone was&#13;
equivalent to that which was developed, through other programs, by the previous State&#13;
Government administration over a period of 4 years.&#13;
14.  In the areas where they were set up, NRDP water supply systems have eliminated the need&#13;
for municipalities to provide water by carro pipa (tanker-truck) to rural communities, both in&#13;
years of "normal" precipitation and in periods of drought (during which additional emergency&#13;
fund contributions may be sought from the State and the Federal Governments). In Paraiba, for&#13;
instance, more than US$4 million was spent over only 10 months during 1993/94 to provide&#13;
water to drought-affected rural areas. Now, NRDP water supply subprojects help to minimize&#13;
that recurring expenditure, and part of the municipal funds previously allotted for water supply&#13;
can be used to attend to the many other needs of the rural populations. For all the municipalities&#13;
which benefited from the 2,700 NRDP water supply subprojects financed in the ten states under&#13;
the reformulated program, the actual annual savings to their respective budgets from not having&#13;
to provide the corresponding carrospipa are estimated to range from a total of about US$7&#13;
million in a year of normal precipitation to US$15 million in a drought year.&#13;
15.   Finally, NRDP investments can generate tax revenue for the State and Municipal&#13;
governments. When marketed formally, certain outputs of productive subprojects are subject to a&#13;
value-added tax (ICMS) which varies, according to the state and the product, between 12% and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -                        Annex B&#13;
17% of the value of the product.2 Where productive subprojects are prevalent and generate&#13;
outputs for the market as, for instance, clothes-making subprojects in Rio Grande do Norte or&#13;
farm tractor subprojects in Minas Gerais, ICMS revenue from NRDP subprojects can be&#13;
significant. In Paraiba, however, the tax revenue from productive investments financed by the&#13;
NRDP is estimated to be small due to two factors: (a) several of the basic commodities produced&#13;
by these subprojects, such as corn, manioc, some fruits and horticultural crops, lamb meat and&#13;
fish, are not subject to the ICMS; (b) for most of those commodities whose sales in formal&#13;
markets are taxed, a substantial part of the production is for family consumption; the only&#13;
exceptions being for specific fruits and vegetables and for clothes, which are produced by only a&#13;
small number of NRDP subprojects in the state.&#13;
Local Level&#13;
16.   At the community level, the impact of the NRDP on both the quality of life of the&#13;
beneficiaries and the local economy has been considerable. The availability of electricity and&#13;
water supply, the localized improvements to feeder roads and bridges, the rehabilitation of rural&#13;
schools and health posts, and finally the provision of community-owned and operated facilities&#13;
and services in support of local production, have changed the socio-economic outlook of entire&#13;
communities which have been reached by the NRDP. With the increases in local capacity and&#13;
multiplier effects produced by the program, endogenous economic development has begun to&#13;
emerge, leading to savings accumulation both at household and community levels. Except in&#13;
cases where technical assistance was deficient, community cohesion was weak and/or cases of&#13;
subproject types addressing individual needs and requiring entrepreneurial skills which poor&#13;
community associations do not possess, the productive investments financed by the NRDP have&#13;
generated higher family production and incomes and created employment opportunities. These&#13;
infrastructure and productive alternatives served as incentives for beneficiaries to remain in the rural&#13;
areas, thus contributing to reducing outmigration to urban or semi-urban centers. Infrastructure&#13;
and social subprojects under the NRDP, providing cleaner water and/or better sanitary conditions,&#13;
also resulted in significant health improvements for the recipient communities -- and the related&#13;
savings in terms of medical assistance, which is another municipal responsibility. Finally, an&#13;
important outcome of the program has been to initiate the creation of social capital in the form of&#13;
organized and sustainable community associations, some of which have begun to leverage project&#13;
funds against other sources of financing to promote their own development.&#13;
17.   Most of the above findings are confirmed by the recent (late 1996) state-specific&#13;
evaluation which was undertaken for Paraiba. In this state, a number of completed subprojects,&#13;
belonging to the major types of investments (predominantly infrastructure) financed under the&#13;
reformulated NRDP or, as it called locally, "Projeto Cooperar," were surveyed in detail.3 An&#13;
2  In Brazil the major tax applicable to marketed products is ICMS, of which 75% goes to the State and 25% is&#13;
divided among the municipalities. It is collected when the sale of the product is certified by a nota fiscal. In&#13;
some states like Paraiba, certain agncultural products and staples are exempt of ICMS.&#13;
3   Although NRDP's generic name in Brazil is PAPP (Programa de apoio ao pequeno produtor), the program&#13;
is known by yet another, specific name in some of the participating states. In Paraiba the original NRDP was&#13;
called Projeto Nordeste and, in its reformulated phase, Projeto Cooperar.&#13;

types, data provided by the state on the number of subprojects implemented, total beneficiaries&#13;
and average cost per beneficiary, are shown in Table 7. Additionally, for some of the productive&#13;
subprojects financial and economic analyses were conducted, the results of which are presented in&#13;

Infrastructure Subprojects&#13;
(a)    Rural electrification. Providing electricity to streets, houses, schools, village&#13;
shops and small-scale processing units in rural areas outside the main distribution&#13;
network, NRDP electrification subprojects have been major contributors to&#13;
improving the quality of life of rural inhabitants. They give access to radio,&#13;
television and the use of domestic appliances, greatly easing household tasks for&#13;
women and improving the well-being of the family as a whole. Electricity also&#13;
generates additional employment and incomes from the increased operation of&#13;
local businesses and agro-industries. In Paraiba, a total of about 64,300 families in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-53 -                         Annex B&#13;
different communities are benefiting from the 1,263 rural electrification subprojects&#13;
financed under the reformulated NRDP. In addition and equally important, many&#13;
of these subprojects have generated productive activities, an example of which is&#13;
provided by the electrification subprojects that were approved for 4 community&#13;
groups in the municipality of Nova Floresta and are producing irrigated maracuja,&#13;
a high-value fruit crop, with a visible impact on the local economy (see results of&#13;
financial and economic analyses in Annex J). Other productive undertakings made&#13;
possible by the NRDP electrification subprojects were for small-scale agro-&#13;
processing (e.g., cereal mills) and production of industrial fodder, in which&#13;
beneficiaries generally invest --the great majority with NRDP support-- once they&#13;
have electricity.&#13;
(b)   Rural water supply. Like much of the rest of the Northeast, Paraiba --about&#13;
80% of whose land area lies in the "drought polygon"-- is subject to cyclical and&#13;
protracted droughts that can have a devastating impact on the lives of its rural&#13;
communities. Due to variation in physical conditions among the different areas,&#13;
rural water supply works implemented under the NRDP differ according to the&#13;
source of water (surface or groundwater) and the type of infrastructure required&#13;
(new or rehabilitated well, reservoir, fountain, etc.). The most common type is a&#13;
"simplified system of water supply", which consists of a communal water tank and&#13;
a simple distribution network, sometimes --but not necessarily-- with individual&#13;
household connections. Water supply subprojects provide a precious resource&#13;
which previously was obtained only through long hours of walking, usually by&#13;
women, or had to be supplied by carro pipa paid by the municipality (para. 14) or,&#13;
for those dwellers who can afford to pay, privately. They lead to savings in time,&#13;
effort and cost, and often to improved health. In Paraiba, nearly 23,000 rural&#13;
families are benefiting from the 264 water supply subprojects that were executed&#13;
under the program.&#13;
Productive Subprojects&#13;
In Paraiba, productive subprojects, while representing a relatively small proportion of total&#13;
investments financed by the NRDP, have been of many different types. The more representative&#13;
types, benefiting groups of diverse agricultural occupations, are the following:&#13;
(a)   Minor irrigation schemes. In Paraiba as in other states where there exists a&#13;
tradition for irrigation, the NRDP, at the request of communities, financed simple&#13;
infrastructure and equipment (kits) for small, communal irrigation schemes. The&#13;
size of these schemes can vary from 2 to 12 ha (each benefiting groups of farming&#13;
families), where groundwater and, occasionally, surface water is used for sprinkder&#13;
or gravity irrigation to produce both subsistence and high-value fruit and&#13;
horticultural crops. A total of about 4,200 farm families are involved in the 79&#13;
small-scale irrigation subprojects that were implemented in Paraiba. Beneficiaries&#13;
are sometimes faced with technical problems (lack of know-how and adequate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -                       Annex B&#13;
technical advice, e.g., in selecting the right varieties to grow or dealing with pests)&#13;
and marketing constraints (seasonal price fluctuations).&#13;
(b)   Cereals processing. The second most popular type of productive subproject in&#13;
Paraiba is for small-scale processing of subsistence crops such as corn, beans, rice&#13;
and manioc. This typically involves the purchase of low-cost equipment that is&#13;
communally operated and maintained by the beneficiary association, substituting&#13;
for time-consuming, manual processing or processing in a private mill usually&#13;
located outside the community. For instance, a familiar structure in all rural areas&#13;
of the Northeast, where manioc is a major food crop consumed primarily in the&#13;
form of flour, is the casa defarinha. Processing of manioc in their own, NRDP-&#13;
financed mills replaces, for the beneficiaries, either home-based, artisanal&#13;
processing producing poor quality flour (with unprocessed manioc sold in kind at&#13;
low prices) or processing at private mills, often located outside the area and at&#13;
higher cost. Community mills result in reduced processing time and costs, and&#13;
generate increased production of flour of superior quality and commanding higher&#13;
prices, both for sale and family consumption. Throughout the region, many casas&#13;
defarinha were set up in the time of the APCR (para. 1) and are still operating.&#13;
Under the reformulated NRDP, 21 new manioc flour mills and an additional 54&#13;
rice and corn mills were financed in Paraiba, benefiting a total of about 8,000 rural&#13;
families.&#13;
(c)   Communal agricultural equipment (forage grinders). Rural communities in&#13;
Paraiba are also keen to obtain financing for various types of agricultural&#13;
equipment that can be used collectively by groups of producers. Over the past&#13;
years, some 55 subprojects of this type were implemented in the state, benefiting&#13;
about 4,800 families. One particular example is forage grinders (forrageiras),&#13;
which are popular with the many livestock producer associations found in parts of&#13;
Paraiba. The equipment is simple, processes locally produced maize and native&#13;
grass, and is operated (usually by a wage-earning employee) and maintained&#13;
communally, with funds sourced by association fees, service fees and other&#13;
contributions by group members, who obtain fodder for their individual herds.&#13;
This type of subproject is highly profitable as it is very low-cost (less than R$6,000&#13;
in current prices, including a shed commonly built by the communities themselves)&#13;
but generates substantial increases in farm incomes through sales of incremental&#13;
meat and milk production (see financial and economic results in Annex J). A total&#13;
of 25forrageiras were financed under the NRDP, benefiting some 2,000 families&#13;
with small herds of livestock.&#13;
(d)   Small ruminants production. Goat subprojects --another type frequently&#13;
requested in Paraiba-- seek primarily to boost the nutrition in rural communities by&#13;
increasing milk and meat consumption. For each beneficiary community, the&#13;
NRDP typically funded the purchase of forty female, two male goats and the&#13;
necessary materials to house and process the animals, such as goat pens and a&#13;
slaughterhouse. While the initial investment benefited a group of twenty families&#13;
on average, continued cycles extended the total beneficiary group. For example,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -                       AnnexB&#13;
from the initial forty females purchased under the subproject, the beneficiary group&#13;
donates the first female calf born to each goat back to the community, in order to&#13;
generate another similar investment. In this way, the initial subproject is leveraged&#13;
by the community to create a network of similar subprojects, thereby establishing a&#13;
"virtuous circle" of community investments. Some 44 small ruminants production&#13;
subprojects were financed by the NRDP in Paraiba, benefiting about 3,550&#13;
families. While these subprojects are modest performers in a financial sense, the&#13;
direct economic benefits of improved nutrition, especially for children, will have a&#13;
long-term payoff in terms of greater health and well-being and educational&#13;
performance.&#13;
(e)   Artisanal risheries. As in other states like Pernambuco, many fishing "colonies"&#13;
(including some constituted by indigenous groups) are found in the coastal areas of&#13;
Paraiba. Most are subsistence fishermen who have traditionally fished using&#13;
artisanal methods and/or earned low wages working on boats that are owned by a&#13;
few better-off individuals or families in or outside the community (most also grow&#13;
food crops on small plots to feed their families). For a number of these fishermen,&#13;
regrouped into associations, the NRDP funded motor boats (or rehabilitation of&#13;
old boats), more modern equipment, and installation of, or improvements in,&#13;
communal processing/marketing infrastructure including freezers to keep the fish&#13;
for sale. The boats and equipment are used either collectively (sometimes in&#13;
shifts), with elaborate arrangements for distribution of production and incomes&#13;
among association members; or they are "sold" to individual members whose&#13;
repayment (in kind and cash) serves to buy new sets for other group members, so&#13;
that the whole association is eventually equipped (i.e., the initial NRDP investment&#13;
generates several other rounds of investments within the beneficiary association).&#13;
Some 31 such artisanal fisheries subprojects were financed, benefiting about 700&#13;
poor fishing families. This type of investment can have a positive impact on&#13;
fishermen's production and incomes, but these are also subject to external factors&#13;
such as fish availability and wide fluctuations in market prices.&#13;
Social Subprojects&#13;
Community demand for social types of investments under the NRDP was relatively&#13;
limited. Major types of social subprojects that were implemented were the following: community&#13;
centers that have both social and productive functions as they can be used by the community to&#13;
meet or have social events in as well as for receiving training; sanitation, through the provision of&#13;
latrines and other such facilities; day care centers (creches), whose principal merit is to enable&#13;
mothers to attend to other activities, including paid employment in order to supplement family&#13;
incomes; and communal wash-houses (lavanderias comunitfrias), providing water for the&#13;
women to wash their family laundry and fulfilling a social function as well.&#13;
Graduation&#13;
18.   By improving living standards and economic conditions of beneficiaries, the NRDP&#13;
initiated a process of accumulation at both the local and household levels, thereby ensuring a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-56 -                        Annex B&#13;
degree of sustainability that previous development efforts in the Northeast did not provide. As&#13;
found in the University of Michigan study (para. 5(b)), socio-economic conditions in the&#13;
communities reached by the program improved notably. In particular, NRDP-funded investments&#13;
accelerated the post-1993 drought recovery of these communities, and provided them with&#13;
incentives to use land more intensively. While rural infrastructure and social subprojects have&#13;
ameliorated, sometimes dramatically, living standards of beneficiary families, they also have, along&#13;
with productive subprojects, generated employment for rural households, and led to improved&#13;
welfare and increased, more stable, family incomes. The resulting better economic conditions&#13;
have provided beneficiaries with initial start-up funds and allowed them to start generating savings&#13;
for financing other investments as well as accessing formal credit. In addition, a notable feature of&#13;
the NRDP was to encourage resource mobilization at the municipal level, as demonstrated by the&#13;
financial participation of municipalities in the program in states like Paraiba and Maranhao.&#13;
19.   Given the relatively high IERRs of some of the productive subprojects (Annex J), it could&#13;
be argued that these cases would have been better attended through credit rather than through a&#13;
grant mechanism. However, the rural poor in the Northeast --the target group of the&#13;
reformulated NRDP-- generally have limited access to credit for such micro-ventures. As an&#13;
alternative to credit, the grant mechanism provided the NRDP beneficiary communities with the&#13;
means to accumulate benefits and save, using these to leverage with the financial sector (as the&#13;
Nova Floresta beneficiaries did, para. 17(a)) to obtain credit for additional investments and&#13;
eventually graduate out of the program. However, careful study is required to determine the&#13;
critical variables to be applied when deciding when a given community or municipality should&#13;
graduate from the program.&#13;
ADVANTAGES OF FUMAC OVER PAC&#13;
20.   The pilot experience of FUMAC under the reformulated NRDP has clearly demonstrated&#13;
that this component was successful and should be expanded. The FUMAC approach instilled&#13;
greater community participation and transparency than PAC and helped strengthen the capacity of&#13;
communities to select and implement subprojects. Although socio-economic benefits produced by&#13;
the two components were similar in many respects, there is enough evidence, as found in Kottak&#13;
and Costa's follow-up study (1994), to assert that greater community participation and&#13;
transparency in decision-making were achieved through FUMAC, since subproject proposals were&#13;
deliberated not only by the community but also by the project Municipal Council at open public&#13;
meetings. Not only did awareness of the program appear to be stronger with FUMAC&#13;
communities than with PAC communities, but participation in decision-making was also found to&#13;
be higher with the first group. Generally, as a result of better selection and prioritization by the&#13;
beneficiaries through the Municipal Council forum, FUMAC subprojects were able to meet the&#13;
program's criteria better than PAC subprojects. This more rigorous process in FUMAC also&#13;
contributed to an increased capacity by communities in FUMAC municipalities to identify, plan&#13;
and implement subprojects. In addition, the stronger and more capable Municipal Councils served&#13;
as catalysts to increase community organization.&#13;
21.   In the majority of Northeast states, local governments and communities have also been&#13;
highly committed to the FUMAC approach. Its success can be measured by the large degree of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-57 -                        Annex B&#13;
acceptance and commitment of these entities, which quickly adhered to its principles of consensus&#13;
building and local development planning -- although this latter aspect would need to be further&#13;
developed, drawing on the encouraging experience of a few participating states (Maranhao,&#13;
Ceara and, on a pilot basis, Paraiba). This translated, as in Maranhlo and Paraiba, into the&#13;
establishment of "FUMAC-like" councils in municipalities originally participating under PAC,&#13;
where local priorities were discussed and collective decisions made on subproject submissions to&#13;
be forwarded to the TUs.&#13;
The FUMAC Experience in Paraiba&#13;
22.   In the participating states, FUMAC was applied most successfully in Paraiba. As seen&#13;
above, nearly 40% of all NRDP subprojects approved in this state were delivered under FUMAC&#13;
(even though this mechanism was introduced, as in other states, on a pilot basis), and at a much&#13;
lower average cost than under PAC (about US$15,300 and US$23,700 per subproject,&#13;
respectively). Beyond these statistics, the most telling indicators of the positive performance of&#13;
FUMAC are the institutional quality and operational capacity of the project Municipal Councils in&#13;
Paraiba. These achievements were the result of two major factors, (a) the sustained and effective&#13;
efforts by the TU to mobilize and train rural communities and Municipal Councils, combined with&#13;
the long-existing tradition of"associativism" in the state, and (b) the restructuring of those&#13;
FUMAC Councils which were found to be ineffectual or lacking transparency.&#13;
23.   The initial ten FUMAC Councils, carefully nurtured by the TU, increased to 16 in 1995&#13;
and to 25 in 1996. From the start of the reformulated program, the TU, to reduce political&#13;
manipulation of these councils (especially at the local level), established two guiding principles for&#13;
organizing and establishing the FUMAC Councils: first, that 50% plus one member with voting&#13;
right in each council be community representatives, and second, that these representatives be&#13;
elected by all members of communities living in the same territorial area or "district". This&#13;
approach was successful in preventing, in Paraiba, undue interference from outside the&#13;
communities and in reinforcing the authentic representation of communities on the Councils -- a&#13;
feature which makes FUMAC Councils in Paraiba more representative and genuine than Councils&#13;
in some of the other states. Training efforts by the TU culminated with the application of the&#13;
participative ZOPP methodology in two important seminars held during 1996, with the&#13;
participation of members of all Fl)MAC Councils except one.4 These seminars produced very&#13;
useful exchanges of experiences between the various FUMAC Councils in the state as well as&#13;
operational plans for these Councils, including specific responsibilities and a schedule of future&#13;
activities.&#13;
24.   The FUMAC Councils in Paraiba are generally able to function in a politically mature and&#13;
transparent fashion even when local authorities are ineffective or indifferent. Some of these&#13;
Councils (e.g., in Sap6 and Serra Branca) have already reached a high level of organizational and&#13;
operational autonomy and are obvious candidates for a program where they would be devolved&#13;
financial autonomy as well. In this sense, Paraiba is clearly ready for the pilot program which has&#13;
4 "Objectives Oriented Project Planning7: a method developed by GTZ (the German bilateral aid agency),&#13;
already succesllly used in Brazil, which develops logical frameworks and management objectives using a&#13;
sedes of workshops to engage stakeholder participation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -                       Annex B&#13;
already been introduced --as a variant of FUMAC-- in the new Rural Poverty Alleviation Projects&#13;
for Bahia and other states, where Municipal Councils with proven capacity and good performance&#13;
are given an annual budget envelope to manage themselves and to use to finance their&#13;
communities' subprojects according to a well prepared annual operating plan.&#13;
TECHNICAL ASSESSMENT OF SUBPROJECTS&#13;
25.   A technical evaluation carried out by the Bank in late 1994 found that in most&#13;
participating states, works executed under the program were generally of good quality,&#13;
particularly when implemented by private contractors (75% of PAC and FUMAC subprojects).&#13;
For the remaining 25% of subprojects (20% executed by municipalities, with unskilled labor often&#13;
provided by beneficiaries, and 5% implemented by the communities themselves), the quality varied&#13;
but remained generally fair to good. Only for a very small proportion (less than 5% of all&#13;
subprojects) was construction quality rated as poor. More recently, the state TU in Paraiba&#13;
conducted its own technical assessment of works executed under the program. Based on a&#13;
representative sample of different types of infrastructure subprojects --from water supply systems&#13;
to small dams and fords-- that constituted about a third of all works built under the reformulated&#13;
NRDP, the quality of construction was rated good in about 30% of subprojects, 50 to 60% fair&#13;
and about 10% Dpoor. There was no major difference in construction quality between works&#13;
implemented by the communities themselves or by a local contractor, and in both cases works&#13;
were found to be of particularly poor quality only for private sanitation facilities.&#13;
26.   Because of their relatively small size, PACtFUMAC subprojects generally do not produce&#13;
significant effects on the environment. However, certain types of projects, by their very nature,&#13;
produce environmentally undesirable by-products (e.g., from the processing of manioc) or lead to&#13;
increased use of products that may have a negative environmental impact (including fertilizers and&#13;
pesticides associated with the use of tractors, wood for fuel in manioc and rice mills). In the&#13;
proposed Rural Poverty Alleviation Project, following the example of similar projects already&#13;
onstream in some of the other Northeast states, these aspects will be given greater consideration.&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL ANALYSIS&#13;
27.   A participatory, demand-driven program addressing a large target population such as the&#13;
reformulated NRDP, involves many actors and stakeholders. The analysis of the performance of&#13;
each of these groups, although varying among the states, yields a generally favorable picture. The&#13;
cfientelistic approach traditionally found in the Northeast remains prevalent in some specific areas&#13;
but, by and large, the program, by promoting transparency and consensus building as well as&#13;
enhancing the capacity of communities to address and prioritize their own needs, succeeded in&#13;
reducing the incidence of politicization and in particular the use of project resources for political&#13;
or personal purposes. In cases where this has happened, however, close and permanent&#13;
monitoring by the Bank and commitment by the State to take appropriate measures so as not to&#13;
penalize beneficiaries, are necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -                       Annex B&#13;
28.   Once mobilized and established with a formal legal status (as is the requirement in Brazil&#13;
for private entities to receive public funds), NRDP community associations generally function&#13;
well. Collective responsibilities such as appointment of office-holders, payment of dues or user&#13;
fees and accounting are generally met by the members, particularly in those groups which are well&#13;
organized, as in Paraiba or Minas Gerais where many date back to the start of the original NRDP.&#13;
Nonetheless, there were instances where communities, under the influence of individuals trying to&#13;
monopolize benefits, were established with the objective of requesting financing for a needed&#13;
subproject, even though they had limited organizational experience. While the potential for&#13;
political influence exists in the organization of these community associations, the outcome has&#13;
been generally favorable as mayors, TU and NGO agents facilitated the spread of information&#13;
about the project and provided the conditions necessary for communities to capitalize on project&#13;
benefits which met their basic needs. In Paraiba, the majority of community associations are&#13;
cohesive and well organized, and are able to voice their aspirations and priorities through well-&#13;
represented FUMAC Councils (paras. 23-24). A feature which is less commonly found in other&#13;
states is that the women, who often are community leaders or presidents of associations, actively&#13;
take part in decision-making, subproject implementation and management of association funds. It&#13;
has also been observed that, although men might prefer productive subprojects, requests made by&#13;
both men and women are overwhelmingly for basic infrastructure, which, as in the case of rural&#13;
electrification, tend to benefit the family as a whole -- improving its living conditions as well as its&#13;
income. This partly explains the dominance of infrastructure subprojects over other types in&#13;
Paraiba.&#13;
29.  In all participating states, however, community associations share a common need for&#13;
technical assistance. Not only is this essential for the organizational development of newly-&#13;
formed associations, but it is also needed to assist the associations during the whole subproject&#13;
cycle, from preparation to implementation and O&amp;M of subprojects. While training and technical&#13;
assistance is a critical input for all subprojects, the need for assistance is more acute for&#13;
productive subprojects where inadequate O&amp;M is often the result of lack of technical know-how&#13;
by the communities. Better access to organizational and management training will also contribute&#13;
to the sustainability of both community associations and subprojects.&#13;
30.   The FUMAC Municipal Councils have been the focal point of the reformulated NRDP's&#13;
decentralization strategy and must be protected from political interference which would&#13;
undermine the demand-driven nature of the progranm In FUMAC, the project Municipal Councils&#13;
review and discuss in a public forum the subproject requests put forward by the communities,&#13;
before submitting them, in priority order, to the TU for financing. The Councils are generally&#13;
chaired by the mayors and comprise representatives from both public and non-governmental&#13;
agencies and community associations. Development and performance of the FUMAC Councils&#13;
can be affected by the attitude of the local political power base, especially that of the mayor, but&#13;
usually, prefeitos were supportive and the disparate interests represented in the Councils found a&#13;
modus vivendi. While political influence can work to the advantage of the FUMAC Councils by&#13;
facilitating the subproject approval process and forging mutual benefits for project Councils and&#13;
municipal governments, this sane influence can undermine the demand-driven approach of the&#13;
project if left unchecked. As seen in para. 24, the performance of some of the FUMAC Councils&#13;
in Paraiba has been strikingly good.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-60 -                        Annex B&#13;
31.   The participation and support of rural municipal governments is important for&#13;
sustainability and should be nenouraged, but with sufficient safeguards against negative political&#13;
influence. While the project Municipal Councils act independently of municipal governments, the&#13;
participation and support of the latter is nonetheless important. Rural municipal governments&#13;
have limited financial resources with which to invest in rural communities and, hence, the&#13;
reformulated NRDP served as an important source of funds at the local level to bridge the gap in&#13;
public resources for investment in poor rural communities. Mayors and municipal leaders viewed&#13;
the project as a welcome source of additional resources for investment to meet basic community&#13;
needs to which their municipal budgets cannot realistically attend. For the most part, mayors,&#13;
municipal legislature members (vereadores) and municipal administrations supported and&#13;
participated in NRDP. In some states, such as Paraiba and Maranhao, the municipal governments&#13;
were encouraged to provide the counterpart funds which the financially strapped state&#13;
governments were unable to supply. While this represented a very promising development, in&#13;
some cases local financial contributions led to political manipulation of the communities. In&#13;
Paraiba, the former situation, where communities benefited from subprojects despite political&#13;
influence, was much more common. And in this state as well as others, in those municipalities&#13;
where the local environment was not conducive to the FUMAC approach owing to, for instance,&#13;
opposition of local political leadership, the PAC component still allowed communities to submit&#13;
proposals directly to the state TUs. However, this delivery mechanism was clearly not as&#13;
democratic and participatory as FUMAC.&#13;
32.   Technical Units need assistance to streamline operational procedures and strengthen&#13;
project supervision. Under the NRDP the TU has been the focal point for project administration&#13;
and the project's principal liaison for the Municipal Councils and for those community&#13;
associations located in PAC municipalities. TUs are attached to the State Planning Secretariat&#13;
(except in Rio Grande do Norte where the TU is located within the State Secretariat for Labor&#13;
and Social Action) and enjoy a large degree of autonomy. Most have established field offices,&#13;
each with one or more technicians. In some cases TUs also handle other development programs&#13;
in the state, but usually these are programs of minor importance. That the TUs have generally&#13;
been successful in promoting NRDP is obvious from the overwhelming community response.&#13;
However, despite their size (generally 40-60 technicians), most TUs found it hard to process the&#13;
large number of subproject proposals and to provide technical assistance for the preparation and&#13;
implementation of subprojects. In addition, supervision of subprojects was weak given the&#13;
logistical constraints of visiting a large number of subprojects. Under the project, technical&#13;
assistance, contracted from IICA and other intemational and bilateral agencies, was provided to&#13;
all state TUs.&#13;
33.   Among the ten states, the Paraiba TU has been comparatively one of the most competent.&#13;
Headed by a dynamic Coordinator who has spent most of her public career in social sectors, the&#13;
TU is genuinely committed to decentralization and participation, and has worked closely with&#13;
rural communities since NRDP inception. Of the total TU managing and technical personnel&#13;
(about 84 tecnicos distributed between headquarters and four regional offices), close to half are&#13;
women agronomists, sociologists, engineers and other professionals. Owing to the relative&#13;
inefficiency of the state rural extension agency (EMATER) and the lack of local NGOs, the TU&#13;
was able to strike few collaborative arrangements with other entities to mobilize communities and&#13;
train FUMAC Municipal Councils. Despite this constraint, it achieved good results and these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -                       Annex B&#13;
Councils are now increasingly capable of taking over part of the TU's tasks in following up with&#13;
communities and in supervising and monitoring the implementation of subprojects.&#13;
34.   The successful cases of NGOs and other technical assistance providers participating in&#13;
the reformulated NRDP need to be replicated. One solution to the problem of the Tus' inability&#13;
to provide sufficient technical assistance and to supervise the large number of subprojects, was for&#13;
the TUs to forge alliances with NGOs or other agencies to provide technical support to&#13;
communities and monitoring services. In Minas Gerais and Alagoas, for instance, EMATER&#13;
provides quality agricultural extension services and has been more supportive and successful than&#13;
in most other states in contributing to income-generating productive subprojects. However, even&#13;
where there is no official alliance between the TU and EMATER, individual extensionists may still&#13;
support NRDP adpersonwn. In general, NGOs have played a mixed role. In certain states,&#13;
churches, rural labor unions and some of the more technical NGOs played a useful part in the&#13;
implementation of subprojects - stimulating and helping with the initial formation of communty&#13;
associations or providing assistance with submission or execution of community proposals. This was&#13;
the case, in particular, of Rio Grande do Norte where NGOs, grouped together under the Fornm do&#13;
Campo, participated actively m the project. Other states, such as Paraiba, suffered from the imited&#13;
presence and/or lack of interest of NGOs in participating in the reformulated NRDP.&#13;
35.   The World Bank Recife Office is fundamental to the coordination and supervision of the&#13;
reformulated NRDP. The three task managers in the Bank's office in Recife (Pernambuco) are&#13;
dedicated exclusively to working with the ten participating states. By delegating all supervision&#13;
activities to the Recife Office, including procurement reviews and field visits, Bank support is&#13;
better tailored to the decentralized structure of the reformulated NRDP.&#13;
Summary Institutional Assessment&#13;
36.  Institutional analysis shows that, by assigning greater responsibility and influence to local&#13;
level organizations and municipal governments, the reformulated NRDP's primary achievement&#13;
has been to support a decentralized approach to resource allocation and the creation of social&#13;
capital in the rural areas of the Northeast. After three years of implementation of the approach&#13;
adopted by the program, it is possible to draw certain conclusions about its institutional&#13;
arrangements and performance. The capacity of both communities and municipal governments to&#13;
prioritize investment decisions is strengthened by the subproject development and approval&#13;
process inherent to the program. The reformulated NRDP provided a fiscal incentive to&#13;
decentralized decision-making, since local level decisions were backed by inflows of project&#13;
resources. The FUMAC approach, in particular, not only placed the power to prioritize&#13;
community investment proposals with local level organizations, but also introduced transparency&#13;
into the resource allocation process for rural investments at the municipal level, thereby&#13;
minimizing the traditional clientelistic approach. FUMAC provided a forum, which did not exist&#13;
before, for local government representatives and community representatives to discuss investment&#13;
needs and priorities. As FUMAC spreads beyond the pilot phase and as municipalities gain more&#13;
years of experience with the mechanism, municipal governments will become more accustomed to&#13;
participatory decision-making processes, and rural community associations will continue to&#13;
exercise their voice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-62 -                        Annex B&#13;
37.   The reformulated NRDP was nonetheless vulnerable to political interference, particuhriy&#13;
where local level organizations such as community associations and FUMAC Municipal Councils&#13;
were newly established, lacking sufficient information, or without adequate technical assistance&#13;
and training, factors needing to be addressed in follow-up projects. Experience under the&#13;
reformulated NRDP demonstrates that there is a fine line between participation of local political&#13;
leaders in the program, which is strongly encouraged, and politicization of the program.&#13;
Politicization occurs when transparency breaks down, which can happen if information about the&#13;
project is not widely and carefully disseminated, or when project internal controls are not&#13;
enforced, such as with weak supervision by the TUs or insufficient external support from NGOs&#13;
or other third parties to monitor project implementation. As municipalities increase their&#13;
contributions to the financing of NRDP investments, greater vigilance will be required to ensure&#13;
that the demand-driven nature of the project is not sacrificed. Also, the FUMAC approach which&#13;
instills greater transparency into the program's resource allocation process can fall prey to&#13;
political interference if community representation on the Councils is insufficient. In addition,&#13;
where technical assistance and training is inadequate, sustainability of the investments is more&#13;
precarious since operation and maintenance of the investments requires certain skill sets which&#13;
may not exist in some communities. Increased "on the job" training to community associations is&#13;
vital to ensure their sustainability, particularly of newly-formed associations.&#13;
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
38.   The generally satisfactory performance of the reformulated NRDP and its favorable impact&#13;
on the lives and incomes of beneficiaries show that after several decades of experience with rural&#13;
development efforts in the Northeast, a good measure of success has been achieved in effectively&#13;
reaching the rural poor with targeted interventions. Some of the most positive results can be&#13;
summarized as follows:&#13;
- The reformulated NRDP put in place objective conditions for the organization of poor&#13;
communities in the ten participating states. In some of these states, organized rural&#13;
communities have shown that they can influence the allocation and use of municipal&#13;
financial resources in such a way as to favor the rural poor.&#13;
* The program fostered the institutional and financial commitment of local governments&#13;
to its decentralized approach to addressing the needs of the rural poor. A large&#13;
number of municipalities, although not legally required either under PAC or FUMAC,&#13;
provided financial and other types of assistance to approved community subprojects.&#13;
In addition, in some states, mayors readily adopted the FUMAC approach and&#13;
instituted it for decision-making on non-project investments at the municipal level.&#13;
* Investments funded by the program have, to a large extent, (i) satisfied real&#13;
community needs; (ii) been of good or satisfactory technical quality and (iii) been&#13;
relatively less costly than those executed by public authorities (municipal, state and&#13;
federal).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -                      Annex B&#13;
*  Beneficiary communities have adhered enthusiastically to the program; such&#13;
enthusiasm translated into participation in the execution and in contributing to the&#13;
costs of operation and maintenance of the investments, enhancing their sense of&#13;
ownership of the subprojects.&#13;
*  Although the reformulated NRDP did not incorporate instruments for structural&#13;
changes in the agriculture of the Northeast, it proved to be a valuable approach for&#13;
reaching and assisting a large number of landless families -- usually excluded from the&#13;
target groups of many other programs, including the original NRDP. Further, land&#13;
reform beneficiaries became a very active clientele of the reformulated program, as it&#13;
provided them with opportunities to satisfy investment needs other than those&#13;
received through the government's land reform program.&#13;
* In the majority of FUMAC participating municipalities, there are encouraging signs&#13;
that the "clientelistic" approach traditionally used in the Northeast to satisfy&#13;
community needs is gradually giving way to a more genuinely participatory and&#13;
transparent approach. This transparency in decision-making has allowed a built-in&#13;
mechanism of "social control" over investments using public funds.&#13;
39.   Nevertheless, project implementation and performance could be improved by introducing&#13;
modifications to its design and operational features. In Paraiba, helped by a favorable local&#13;
setting, the NRDP was particularly successful in promoting the FUMAC consultative and&#13;
participatory approach and in bringing about improvements in the quality of ife of beneficiary&#13;
communities in the state. However, the predominance of electrification subprojects, often&#13;
encouraged by the State, should give way in future projects to more directly productive as well as&#13;
social investments that would further enhance the incomes and well-being of such communities.&#13;
40.   Taken together, the various evaluations of the NRDP have brought to light a number of&#13;
lessons, which suggest that the following modifications be made to the design of successor&#13;
projects:&#13;
41.   Expand FUMAC. The projects should expand FUMAC and initiate a pilot municipal&#13;
funds program (FUMAC-P), to promote further decentralization of decision-making to municipal&#13;
and community levels, to relieve the administrative logjam resulting from state intervention in the&#13;
minutiae of subprojects, and to further encourage municipal cost-sharing of subprojects. The&#13;
appraisal and subsequent approval of community subprojects by Municipal Councils under&#13;
FUMAC and FUMAC-P would significantly reduce the role played by TUs in approving&#13;
subprojects -and the bias that this implies-- in the existing program. Also, FUMAC tends to be&#13;
more effective in thwarting political interference because of the increased transparency of its&#13;
subproject approval process over that of PAC. Increasing community representation on the&#13;
Councils to at least 80% of all voting members will help Councils resist overpowering political&#13;
influence.&#13;
42.   Supervision. By the same token, supervision of subprojects by the TUs should be more&#13;
rigorous, including by contracting external assistance as in Rio Grande do Norte where a NGO&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-64 -                        Annex B&#13;
was contracted for this purpose. Supervision, both during and after implementation of the&#13;
subprojects, is an indispensable determinant of their success and sustainability. Increased supervision&#13;
would improve the quality of implementation of subprojects and would help identify and resolve&#13;
potential problems in subproject operation and subsequent maintenance.&#13;
43.   Standard Designs and Appraisal Criteria. For simplicity and efficiency in subproject&#13;
preparation, evaluation and supervision, as well as for minimizing design deficiencies, the Project&#13;
Operational Manuals should establish standard engineering designs, technical and financial&#13;
parameters, and cost indicators for the most frequently requested subprojects. Standaon of&#13;
subproject documents, technical designs and unit costs simplifies the subproject preparation and&#13;
evaluation process, facilitates the procurement of goods and works, prevents overdesign and improves&#13;
the quality of subprojects, enourgig greater participation by poorer communities and reducing&#13;
bottlenecks in the subproject cycle. Also, environmental assessment criteria should be part of the&#13;
Operational Manual and routinely monitored during subproject supervision.&#13;
44.   Productive Subprojects. The managerial requirements and profit maximization&#13;
objectives of certain types of productive subprojects are difficult to meet when they are financed&#13;
in a social context and operated and maintained communally as under the NRDP. To ensure&#13;
sustainability, productive subprojects financed by such a program should be subject to rigorous&#13;
selection, preparation, technical assistance and supervision. Eligible productive investments&#13;
should be those that provide services for a large number of community members; whose collective&#13;
use is regulated by strict operational guidelines (regulamento de uso); and for which operation&#13;
and maintenance is assured by charging adequate user fees to both association members and non-&#13;
members.&#13;
45., Technical Assistance and Training. Funds for technical assistance and training should&#13;
be channeled to rural communities and project Municipal Councils to enable participation of the&#13;
poorest areas, foster community capacity and empowerment, and encourage the active&#13;
participation of able and competent NGOs and local development agencies. Increased technical&#13;
assistance to rural communities also will enable them to identify, prepare and implement their own&#13;
subprojects, thereby augmenting their capacity to compete for investment funds and to operate and&#13;
maintain the subprojects appropriately. In addition, technical assistance activities should be targeted to&#13;
project Muncipal Councils to improve their planning. management and financial capacity. Finally, the&#13;
quality and capacity of the Technical Unit is a critical factor in project success, and thus its institutional&#13;
strengthening, which may entail the contracting of international or bilateral aid-funded entities such as&#13;
RCA or GTZ, as is currently practiced, should receive increased attention. The TUs should actively&#13;
organize all technical assistance and training arrangements under the project and oversee the&#13;
quality of said activities.&#13;
46.   Participation and Transparency. In addition to the above measures, participation and&#13;
transparency should be further enhanced by setting clear rules for the composition and modus&#13;
operand of project Municipal Councils, with more than 80% of members coming from&#13;
community representatives and local civil society. Greater efforts by the TUs to organize and&#13;
mobilize poor communities are also fundamental in order to enable these communities to&#13;
participate in project benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -                       Annex B&#13;
47.   Transparency should also be promoted by incorporating a system of operational incentives&#13;
and penalties into the project design. Incentives for positive performance and penalties against&#13;
departures from project guidelines --misappropriation of resources, mistargeting of project&#13;
benefits, faulty subproject design, insufficient community participation or lack of proper O&amp;M-&#13;
should accompany the increased decentralization of resources and decision-making responsibilities&#13;
to beneficiaries and project Municipal Councils through FUMAC and FUMAC-P. This&#13;
framework of incentives and disincentives would require backing by the TUs through ex-past&#13;
control of subproject activities through auditing of accounts, and supervision and monitoring.&#13;
48.   Finally, to minimize the risk of political manipulation and increase participation, the&#13;
Northeast states must better tailor their information campaigns to the rural poor and ensure that&#13;
information about the project, particularly its objectives, operational guidelines and procedures for&#13;
soliciting financing, is widely disseminated to all potential beneficiaries. Better and more widely&#13;
disseminated information campaigns will also increase transparency --stimulating the role of public&#13;
"watchdogs"-- and will put all communities on a level playing field with respect to access to&#13;
project benefits.&#13;
49.   Sustainability. Through a system of matching grants to poor nrral community associations,&#13;
the reformulated NRDP has improved the quality of life and the economic and social conditions of its&#13;
beneficiaries. By providing an initial jump-start to poor communities previously without investment&#13;
capital, the reformulated NRDP initiated a process of local accumulation at the beneficiary and&#13;
community levels and laid the groundwork for sustainable local development. This process will be&#13;
further encouraged through greater financial participation of municipal governments in subproject&#13;
investments, a process which has already been launched in several states under the NRDP and should&#13;
be expanded but with appropriate safeguards. Sustainability of the subproject investments also has&#13;
greater potential when the municipalities and communities contribute to the subproject financing in a&#13;
cost-sharing arrangement and when there is increased beneficiary participation. Beneficiary&#13;
cuterpart contributions should be better quantified and should count toward the global counterpart&#13;
fund requirements. Furthermore, increased technical assistance and training to rural communities&#13;
as well as stronger supervision by the TUs will improve the quality of implementation of&#13;
subprojects and stem potential problems in subproject operation and maintenance, which can&#13;
impede sustainability.&#13;
50.   Cost Sharing and Graduation. A strategy should be formalized to graduate&#13;
municipalities and communities from the program, once a certain level of accumulated benefits has&#13;
been reached. A fundamental element of a feasible graduation strategy would be the criteria&#13;
adopted to determine the point of graduation, backed by appropriate data which can be collected&#13;
to implement such a strategy. The strategy would need to carefully consider beneficiaries' access&#13;
to credit as well as monitorable indicators of income levels and local capacity to manage funds, as&#13;
would be demonstrated through mastery of the FUMAC-P approach.&#13;
51.   Monitoring and Evaluation. A user-friendly monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system&#13;
facilitates the subproject evaluation process, provides feedback and necessary information to&#13;
improve targeting and efficiency, and serves as an effective management and planning tool.&#13;
Project design should pay careful attention to baseline studies as the springboard for well-&#13;
designed M&amp;E and for ex-post financial and economic evaluation of productive subprojects. To&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -                       Annex B&#13;
bolster the measurement of overall project impact, the M&amp;E system would need to expand the&#13;
range of project impact indicators and performance benchmarks. Examples include: increased&#13;
employment for women; improved health and related "savings" to State/municipal budgets;&#13;
resource mobilization at the local/municipal level; and indicators of migration. In addition, the&#13;
project M&amp;E system must be geared to collect the information necessary to support a graduation&#13;
strategy. Therefore, as a condition of loan effectiveness, the project M&amp;E system should be&#13;
improved to reinforce the mechanisms for targeting and to secure reliable data for evaluating&#13;
subproject impact, as well as to facilitate better control and project management throughout the&#13;
subproject cycle by the TUs.&#13;
52.   "Best Practice" Exchanges. Across the ten states of the reformulated NRDP, there exist&#13;
numerous successful interventions that could be replicated to the benefit of the whole program,&#13;
such as the experience with FVMAC Councils in Paraiba, the preparation of municipal&#13;
development plans in Maranhao, EMATER in Mmnas Gerais or NGOs in Rio Grande do Norte. In&#13;
addition, certain states have adopted technical parameters or have developed training materials&#13;
which have produced positive results and should be disseminated throughout the program. Thus,&#13;
"best practice" exchanges should be arranged among the TUs to share successful experiences and&#13;
to reward innovation. At the state level, as is being done in Paraiba, community associations with&#13;
successful subprojects or possessing certain skills should also be encouraged to share these with&#13;
other associations through training seminars and workshops as well as field visits.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT - PARAIBA&#13;
C. TARGETING MECHANISMS AND PROJECT&#13;
MUNICIPALITIES&#13;
1.    Targeting of the rural poor is of critical importance in the project, particularly as&#13;
justification for the use of grants for subproject financing. Under the project, it is&#13;
proposed that targeting occur at three levels:&#13;
(a)   geographically by poverty level and other characteristics of the&#13;
municipalities;&#13;
(b)   geographically within municipalities to target rural settlements and&#13;
communities; and&#13;
(c)   community-based selection of poor beneficiaries and particularly&#13;
vulnerable groups by the project Municipal Councils.&#13;
2.    Municipalities. Targeting at the first and second levels defines the project area.&#13;
AUl municipalities, with the exception of the municipality of Joao Pessoa, are included in&#13;
the project area, bringing the project municipalities to a total of 222. Targeting of these&#13;
municipalities takes into consideration the concentration of income and economic activity&#13;
in the metropolitan area of the capital and the higher incidence of poverty in the&#13;
municipalities of the interior, manifested by such indicators as the rate of indigence,&#13;
availability of municipal resources, and other socio-economic indicators.' According to&#13;
IPEA (1993), all but six municipalities in the state suffer a rate of indigence greater than&#13;
50%. In addition, since rural poverty in Paraiba is closely correlated with the poor natural&#13;
resource base, the harsh agro-climatic conditions and concentration of land ownership, the&#13;
project area includes the entire semi-arid region and other parts of the state (close to 80%&#13;
of the state falls within the "drought polygon"). The rural poor are primarily smallholders,&#13;
sharecroppers and wage workers, who depend on a diverse strategy of income-generating&#13;
activities in which the subsistence production of maize, beans, manioc and rice, and small&#13;
livestock predominates.&#13;
3.    Within the project municipalities, the selection of PAC and FUMAC municipalities&#13;
will be based on criteria such as past performance under the reformulated NRDP,&#13;
estimation of the organizational capacity of communities within the municipality, and&#13;
"progressiveness" of the mayor and municipal administration. The criteria for selection of&#13;
Rate of indigence equals the number of families below the official poverty line established by&#13;
IPEA divided by the total number of families in the municipality. See 0 Mapa da Fome, IPEA,&#13;
March 1993.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -                          Annex C&#13;
FUMAC-P municipalities is included in Annex F. As an incentive and basis for a&#13;
reasonable rate of development for FUMAC and FUMAC-P Councils, a minimum of 5&#13;
subprojects would be financed annually for each of these Councils. Adopting this rule and&#13;
based on the experience of the NRDP in terms of subproject costs in Paraiba, amounts&#13;
initially allocated to the two subcomponents would permit the establishment of 136&#13;
FUMAC Councils and 20 FUMAC-P Councils during the project period.&#13;
4.    Rural Settlements and Communities. The second level of targeting, within&#13;
municipalities, focuses on rural settlements and communities. Beneficiary settlements or&#13;
communities are limited to those with a population of or under 7,500 people.&#13;
5.    Community-based Selection. The third and principal level of targeting is&#13;
community-based selection. The project assumes that local communities can best judge&#13;
which community groups are poor and what investment priorities are in each municipality&#13;
and/or each community. The process of consensus-building at the local level by project&#13;
Municipal Councils helps to ensure that only poor communities benefit from the project.&#13;
During the open meetings to set priorities, criteria such as the socio-economic situation of&#13;
the participating communities, including existing infrastructure and availability of services,&#13;
would be discussed as part of the ranking of subprojects within the municipality. The&#13;
composition of the Municipal Councils, in which 80% are representatives from rural&#13;
communities and local civil society, as well as the clear and transparent rules and&#13;
procedures for the Councils' functioning, are important elements which facilitate targeting&#13;
poor beneficiaries. Finally, indicative targets set for social subprojects and those which&#13;
benefit women in particular, should be considered by the Municipal Councils as criteria for&#13;
subproject selection, insofar as the principles of need and perceived benefits guide ranking&#13;
decisions.&#13;
6.    The effectiveness of the targeting methodology would be assessed through the&#13;
project monitoring system and through ex-post evaluation studies. For example, annual&#13;
physical performance reviews (Annex H) would monitor the targeting of project benefits.&#13;
Also, the project implementation review (Annex H) would measure the ability of the&#13;
project to target and reach the poor. Adjustments and fine-tuning of the targeting&#13;
methodology would be based on these ex-post reviews, in agreement with the Bank.&#13;
GRADUATION STRATEGY&#13;
7.    The demand-driven community development model presented in the proposed&#13;
project is expected to increase the income-generating capacity and standards of living in&#13;
the beneficiary communities. Because project resources will be targeted to the poorest&#13;
rural communities, certain communities with better socio-economic standing relative to&#13;
others would receive fewer investment resources during the course of project&#13;
implementation. These communities, able to leverage a critical mass of subprojects and&#13;
other benefits from this and previous Bank-financed and other projects, would gain access&#13;
to other sources of financing and reach a point where a "safety net" is no longer necessary.&#13;
In order to formalize this process, the proposed project would introduce a community&#13;
graduation strategy whereby those communities with demonstrated capacity for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -                         Annex C&#13;
sustainable asset-accumulation (savings), adequate social and economic infrastructure and&#13;
community organization, would no longer be eligible for project matching grants.&#13;
8.    To make this judgment, baseline profiles of beneficiary communities would be&#13;
developed using indicators of community well-being collected from community subproject&#13;
proposals. Each subproject proposal would be accompanied by a 'fact sheet' to be filled&#13;
out by the community which would provide indication of the community's socio-economic&#13;
standing. The questions asked would extract information on benefits from previous&#13;
subprojects as well as from NRDP and other public programs, existing infrastructure and&#13;
access to social services, and indicators of accumulation/savings, such as: (a) the average&#13;
income of families in the community, in terms of minimum wages; (b) the average portion&#13;
of this income which fimilies dedicate to buy food; (c) the average portion of family&#13;
income dedicated to buying medicines; and (d) the percentage of community households&#13;
which have electricity, which have secure access to water and/or treated water, and which&#13;
have access to a health post. The information contained in the baseline community profiles&#13;
would be incorporated in the project MIS, and regularly updated through monitoring and&#13;
supervision exercises.&#13;
9.    At the end of the second year, the project would finance a study to detenmine the&#13;
point at which a community would be charged a higher cost-sharing percentage as well as&#13;
the "take-off po  the point at which a community would graduate out of the project.&#13;
The study would be based on a comparison of community profiles and on information&#13;
from the baseline impact evaluation (see Annex H). Using this analysis, the PCU (for&#13;
PAC) and the Muiicipal Councils (for FUMAC and FUMAC-P), aided by the PCU,&#13;
would graduate those communities which have reached this "take-off' point. As&#13;
communities graduate, those municipalities with fewer eligible communities would&#13;
gradually receive less funding for subprojects and, concurrently, would graduate from the&#13;
project as well.&#13;
&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT - PARAIBA&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND PROJECT&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
1.    The success of the Rural Poverty Alleviation Project in Paraiba in meeting its&#13;
stated objectives is dependent on the strength and capabilities of four distinct groups of&#13;
entities: (a) community organizations; (b) project (FUMAC and FUMAC-P) Municipal&#13;
Councils; (c) the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU); and (d) participating govenmental and&#13;
non-governmental agencies.&#13;
COMMuNrTy ORGANIZATIONS&#13;
2.    Community associations are the legitimate representatives of the beneficiaries&#13;
before the Municipal Councils and the State under the project, which will only benefit&#13;
those communities organized into legally-constituted civil associations. This, a&#13;
prerequisite under Brazilian law for associations to receive public fuinds, also helps ensure&#13;
that the project meets the needs of a representative group from a given community and not&#13;
simply the needs of its more vocal or politically influential constituents. Due to the rather&#13;
cumbersome legal process in Brazil for forming associations, the project only requires that&#13;
the association be legally formed once the subproject proposal has been approved.&#13;
3.    Under local law, the organization of community associations typically comprises an&#13;
Executive Board of Directors, a General Assembly and a Fiscal Council. The Executive&#13;
Board of Directors comprises the President, Secretary, and Treasurer and the&#13;
Coordinators of any special working groups within the Association. These fixed-term&#13;
positions are fiHed by the vote of the General Assembly which meets regularly every three&#13;
months to discuss and vote on the Association's work program and internal procedures.&#13;
All decisions made by the General Assembly are registered in official documents (atas)&#13;
and signed by all members present. This procedure is reflected in the identification and&#13;
prioritization of subprojects: a subproject proposal addresses the needs of a majority of&#13;
the association, as voted by its members, and therefore is accompanied by an ata signed by&#13;
the association members. The fiscal council, normally composed of three members,&#13;
supervises all of the association's activities and functions as internal auditor of all financial&#13;
transactions made by the association. The principal source of funds for most associations&#13;
is monthly dues paid by members.&#13;
4.    Community associations are the foundation of project implementation. The&#13;
associations are responsible for formulating and prioritizing ideas for subprojects and&#13;
submitting these proposals to the Municipal Councils (under FUMAC and FUMAC-P) or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-78 -                           Annex D&#13;
to the PCU (under PAC) for financing. The General Assembly deliberates and votes on&#13;
each subproject proposal, thereby ensuring that these subprojects attend to the needs of&#13;
the majority of the association members. The signed ata which accompanies each&#13;
subproject proposal attests to the association's commitment to the subproject. Once a&#13;
subproject has been approved, the community association enters into a legally binding&#13;
agreement with the PCU and/or Municipal Council through which the funds to implement&#13;
the subproject are passed to the association. The association, in most cases, is responsible&#13;
for all procurement and record-keeping during the implementation of the subproject. This&#13;
agreement also binds the association to provide the necessary counterpart contribution&#13;
(which can include labor, materials and cash) to execute the subproject as well as&#13;
undertake the future operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) of the investment. In the case of&#13;
infrastructure, the association generally transfers O&amp;M to appropriate public sector&#13;
agencies (e.g., the local electricity company in the case of rural electrification subprojects)&#13;
to which it pays the relevant user fees.&#13;
5.    Implementation of subprojects therefore implies significant responsibility for the&#13;
community associations and the communities which they represent, and is a source of&#13;
empowerment for them. Charging the communities with the primary responsibility for the&#13;
implementation of their own subprojects assures better quality and reinforces their sense of&#13;
ownership. The supervision and administration of the subprojects is caried out by an&#13;
elected Supervision and Control Committee, which oversees the subproject from start to&#13;
finish and reports back to the association on progress. This Committee of three to four&#13;
persons is comprised of subproject beneficiaries, both members of the association and non-&#13;
members within the community. The members of the Committee are elected by the&#13;
beneficiaries-at-large and are recognized as having some experience or knowledge about&#13;
the proposed subproject type. The Committee visits the subproject regularly and monitors&#13;
subproject implementation, costs, procurement, and community contribution, as well as&#13;
any potential problems. The Supervision and Control Committee therefore acts as a&#13;
"community watchdog" to ensure that subproject funds and the community's contribution&#13;
are invested in accordance with the subproject agreement and that the investment is of a&#13;
high quality.&#13;
MUNICIPAL COUNCILS&#13;
6.    Under the proposed project, FUMAC and FUMAC-P Municipal Councils may be&#13;
formed as legally-constituted civil organizations or may be established through Municipal&#13;
decree. In the latter case, the Council must nonetheless be granted administrative and&#13;
financial autonomy from the local municipal government. The size of the Municipal&#13;
Councils will vary across municipalities (usually between ten and fifteen members) and&#13;
their profile will be representative of the beneficiary communities. Of the Council's voting&#13;
power 80% is granted to representatives of community associations and of local civil&#13;
society, such as NGOs, labor unions and religious organizations. The remaining 20%&#13;
represent Municipal Government and other public institutions such as EMATER. The&#13;
PCU has a seat on the Council with the right to voice but not vote. Members of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-79 -                          Annex D&#13;
Council are elected for one-year terms (which can be renewed once) by a community&#13;
assembly.&#13;
7.    While the project Municipal Councils act independently of the Municipal&#13;
Govemnment, the participation and support of the latter is nonetheless important.&#13;
Experience under the reformulated NRDP has demonstrated that the mayors and&#13;
municipal leadership welcome the project Municipal Councils as an instrument to meet&#13;
basic community needs to which their municipal budgets cannot realistically attend. The&#13;
participation of the mayor is fundamental in creating a synergy between the priorities of&#13;
the Council and the Municipal Government's investment program. In this sense, the&#13;
project Municipal Council is not seen as a parallel institution to Municipal Government but&#13;
as a counterpart.&#13;
8.    Municipal Councils are the key organization for the targeting of project benefits&#13;
and the allocation of resources under the proposed project. The Councils have a&#13;
fundamental role in mobilizing communities and fomenting community participation in&#13;
decision-making at the municipal level. By their nature as open, representative and&#13;
d*emocratic bodies which build consensus on priorities, the Municipal Councils instill&#13;
transparency into the decision-making process for FUMAC and FUMAC-P investments.&#13;
The Councils receive, prioritize and approve subproject proposals from the beneficiary&#13;
associations. The monthly meetings of the Municipal Councils are widely publicized and&#13;
the public is encouraged to attend them. At these meetings, the beneficiary associations&#13;
present their subproject ideas to the Council. The Council deliberates and prioritizes the&#13;
subproject proposals based on its determination of the needs of the different communities,&#13;
and on criteria such as the level of poverty and the existing infrastructure of each&#13;
community in relation to the rest of the municipality; the type of subproject to be financed&#13;
and its potential to improve the life quality of the beneficiary population; and the&#13;
demonstrated participation of the beneficiary community in the identification of the&#13;
subproject and its commitment to the implementation and subsequent operation and&#13;
maintenance of the subproject. The Municipal Councils' prioritization process is the basis&#13;
of targeting in the project since the communities themselves through the Councils&#13;
determine where project resources will best be applied based on their first-hand&#13;
knowledge of local investment needs. The Council ranks the subprojects in priority order&#13;
based on the vote of the Council members. The subproject approval process is based on&#13;
technical and eligibility criteria. The Municipal Council screens the FUMAC/FUMAC-P&#13;
subprojects based on pre-established technical, environmental and cost/financial standards&#13;
(see Annex G) and either approves or rejects the proposals. Rejected subprojects are&#13;
returned to the beneficiary association with recommendations to improve the proposal.&#13;
Decisions for approval or rejection of subproject proposals are also determined by vote.&#13;
Under FUMAC, approved subprojects are sent by the Municipal Councils to the PCU in&#13;
order of priority for financing. In the case of FUMAC-P, the subprojects are financed&#13;
directly by the relevant Councils within an annual budget envelope as described below.&#13;
9.    A FUMAC-P Council bases its investment decisions on an Annual Operating Plan&#13;
(POA), developed with the assistance of the PCU at the start of every fiscal year. This&#13;
POA, which is voted on by Council members after detailed deliberations, establishes the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-80 -                           Annex D&#13;
development priorities of the communities within a given municipality and the&#13;
corresponding investments to be financed with project resources. Each year, based on the&#13;
POA prepared, the PCU will transfer the allotted budget to the Council. The Council, in&#13;
turn, will transfer fiuds for subprojects approved to the beneficiary associations on the&#13;
basis of signed, legal agreements. This concept of approving subprojects within a budget&#13;
envelope enhances the Council's capacity to program and prioritize investments. If, on&#13;
the other hand, the Council's performance is unsatisfactory, it will run the risk of seeing its&#13;
budget envelope reduced the following year.&#13;
10.   Municipal Councils also supervise the implementation of subprojects in the&#13;
communities and work closely with the Community Control and Supervision Committee in&#13;
this respect. The Councils are well placed to provide this assistance. Given their&#13;
proximity to the communities and their lines of communication both with the PCU and&#13;
with the communities themselves, Municipal Councils are effective trouble-shooters for&#13;
subproject implementation problems.&#13;
PROJECT COORDINATING UNT&#13;
11.   The PCU is the focal point for project administration and for communication with&#13;
the Bank and the State Government. It is also the project's principal liaison for the&#13;
Municipal Councils and for those community associations located in PAC municipalities.&#13;
In Paraiba, the PCU is the Unidade Tdcnica do Projeto Cooperar, an entity which enjoys&#13;
financial autonomy but is administratively linked to the State Secretariat of Planning.'&#13;
Under the proposed project, the PCU will shed some of its executive responsibilities that it&#13;
held under the reformulated NRDP and increase its monitoring, technical assistance and&#13;
supervision responsibilities. It will promote decentralization and community participation&#13;
in the project by delegating tasks to Municipal Councils and participating state and non-&#13;
governmental organizations.&#13;
12.   The Unidade T4cnica is headed by a General Coordinator who is assisted by three&#13;
functional Coordenadorias in charge, respectively, of administrative, financial and&#13;
technical matters (current structure established by law in 1993). Under the reformulated&#13;
NRDP, execution of the PAC and FUMAC programs was carried out through two distinct&#13;
units, directly responsible to the General Coordinator and the Technical Coordenadoria&#13;
and assisted in the field by four regional offices strategically located in the interior&#13;
(Itaporanga, Areia, Patos and Pombal). Of the PCU's technical staff, about 64 (excluding&#13;
the General Coordinator and her Chief of Cabinet) operate out of headquarters in Joao&#13;
Pessoa while an additional 20 are based in the regional offices. The organizational&#13;
structure of the PCU will be revised in line with the new project's decentralization&#13;
strategy, that would redirect the PCU's efforts towards monitoring, field supervision,&#13;
technical assistance and training, rather than direct execution of most of the project&#13;
Technical Unit for Projeto Cooperar (previously Projeto Nordeste), as the reformulated NRDP has&#13;
been known in Paralba.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-81-                           Annex D&#13;
activities. Under the proposed, more simplified structure (see Organizational Chart at the&#13;
end of this Annex), the General Coordinator, assisted by a Technical Advisory Group,&#13;
would oversee the same number (three) of Departments or Coordenadorias but the&#13;
responsibilities of these would be somewhat changed, as follows: the Planning, Monitoring&#13;
and Evaluation Department (Coordenadoria de Planejamento) would be in charge of&#13;
preparing/consolidating project POAs, elaborating and refining the project Operational&#13;
Manual, processing subproject proposals received from the communities and the&#13;
Municipal Councils, managing the Special Account and coordinating the management of&#13;
subproject finds, monitoring project activities through the MIS, carrying out or&#13;
contracting evaluation studies, and finally preparing physical and financial performance&#13;
reports on the project; the Technical Operations Department (Coordenadoria de&#13;
Operag6es), in charge of field operations (including community mobilization, technical&#13;
assistance and training, and subproject appraisal) would function through 4 Regional&#13;
Technical Groups composed of multi-disciplinary teams with logistical and technical&#13;
support by the four existing field offices; and, the Administrative and Financial Support&#13;
Department (Coordenadoria de Apoio) would have responsibility for general PCU&#13;
administrative, financial and human resource aspects. In addition, the General&#13;
Coordinator would be supported by an Advisory Consultative Council, constituted by&#13;
selected personnel from the various units and whose main role would be to provide, as&#13;
needed, advice in the final stage of approval of the community investments to be funded&#13;
under the project.&#13;
13.   The PCU's principal tasks under the project will include: (a) project planning and&#13;
coordination at the state level through the preparation of POAs, including the&#13;
consolidation of POAs by FUMAC-P Councils, and monitoring activities through&#13;
maintenance of the project Management Information System (MIS); (b) promoting the&#13;
project and encouraging participation of potential beneficiary communities, NGOs and&#13;
private sector entities; (c) preparing project implementation reports and organizing&#13;
evaluation exercises; (d) ensuring timely and adequate provision of loan and state&#13;
counterpart funds; (e) appraising and approving all PAC subproject proposals; (f) entering&#13;
into subproject agreements with community associations (PAC) and Municipal Councils&#13;
(FUMAC) and into POA-based agreements with FUMAC-P Municipal Councils, to&#13;
transfer subproject funds and monitor their use; (g) overseeing all monitoring and&#13;
supervision activities under the project to gauge compliance with project guidelines and to&#13;
improve the quality of subprojects and project interventions, ensuring that environmental&#13;
guidelines for subproject approval and implementation are followed; (h) providing&#13;
technical assistance to the FUMAC and FUMAC-P Municipal Councils; (i) preparing&#13;
statements of expenditure (SOEs) and applications for reimbursement; and (j) ensuring&#13;
that procurement, disbursement and auditing procedures applicable to the Bank loan are&#13;
followed. To increase the current Unidade Tecnica's capacity to undertake some of these&#13;
tasks, particularly with respect to stimulating the mobilization and organization of&#13;
communities and providing technical assistance to them, training in specific areas will be&#13;
organized for its staff under the institutional development component of the project&#13;
(Annex E). In the area of environmental impact assessment, the PCU will be provided&#13;
training and assistance from specialized national or state agencies such as the Brazilian&#13;

Institute for the Environment (IBAMA) and the State Superintendency for the&#13;
Environment (SUDEMA).&#13;
INSTIrUTIONAL CAPACITY&#13;
14.   The project, through the community subproject methodology, is expected to lay&#13;
the groundwork for, and consolidate, participatory institutions and processes at the&#13;
municipal and community levels. Formed into community associations, the rural&#13;
population is gaining a voice and a role in political participation which it did not have as&#13;
individuals. When communities organize themselves to receive benefits from the project,&#13;
and contribute to and operate and maintain the investments, the sense of ownership of the&#13;
investment empowers the communities and their organization and commitment are&#13;
rewarded. A municipality participates in the FUMAC (and eventually FUMAC-P)&#13;
program when this level of organization is apparent at the municipal level, and the official&#13;
municipal leadership supports participatory decision-making. The project Municipal&#13;
Council in FllMAC formalizes the communities' voice in the establishment of investment&#13;
priorities at the municipal level. FUMAC also forges a partnership between the&#13;
communities and municipal leadership as both groups contribute to the financing of&#13;
investments, thus leveraging project funds. As Municipal Councils gain experience and&#13;
capacity, progressing from FUMAC to FUMAC-P, they increase their bearing and&#13;
influence on public resource programming at the municipal level while reinforcing a&#13;
sustainable participatory process. Such an experience has been gained in a number of&#13;
highly organized municipalities in some of the northeast states under the reformulated&#13;
NRDP.&#13;
15.  Implementation capacity is central to the successful performance of the community&#13;
subprojects component and, hence, of the project's development objectives.&#13;
Implementation capacity constraints of the various institutions participating in the project&#13;
--beneficiary associations, Municipal Councils, public and non-governmental agencies, and&#13;
the PCU itself- are specifically addressed by the project's institutional development&#13;
component. This component provides resources to finance appropriate technical&#13;
assistance and training in order that each group acquire the capabilities needed to&#13;
effectively perform its functions under the project (see Annex E for operational details).&#13;
16.   The institutional development component will give community associations access&#13;
to funds for community mobilization and organizational strengthening. Beneficiary&#13;
associations will also have access to expertise on subproject preparation and execution, as&#13;
well as training in operation and maintenance techniques to derive optimal benefit from&#13;
subproject investments. By providing training in financial administration, the project will&#13;
also prepare these groups to manage productive activities which open doors for future&#13;
income-generating endeavors. To fully develop their potential leadership role at the&#13;
municipal level and to fulfill their role within the project, Municipal Councils will require&#13;
assistance to orient their decision-making on resource allocation among community&#13;
investments and, in the FUMAC-P program, to develop their capacity for investment&#13;
planning and financial administration. Municipal Councils will also themselves serve as a&#13;

techniques as well as enhanced project management and other skills. Where the PCU&#13;
contracts NGOs or other state agencies to assist in filfilling some of its technical&#13;
assistance, monitoring and supervision tasks, these institutions may also receive specific&#13;
training under the project.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT - PARAtBA&#13;
E. TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE, TRAINING AND&#13;
INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY-BUILDING&#13;
1.    Both technical assistance and training are fundamental inputs into the various&#13;
stages of the subproject cycle and overall project implementation. Evaluations of the&#13;
reformulated NRDP have emphasized the need for improved technical assistance and&#13;
training to the different partners in project execution -community associations, project&#13;
Municipal Councils and Project Coordinating Units (PCUs)-- in order to ensure higher&#13;
quality planning and implementation and greater sustainability of subprojects and to&#13;
increase the development impact of the project. Under the proposed Paraiba Rural&#13;
Poverty Alleviation project, technical assistance (TA) would be provided in two forms:&#13;
(a) under the Institutional Development comnponent of the project; and (b) as a percentage&#13;
of the cost of community subprojects. Details on the operational aspects for the provision&#13;
of TA are included in the project Operational Manual.&#13;
2.    The Institutional Development Component. Funds under the project's&#13;
institutional development component would be used: (a) to mobilize and strengthen the&#13;
planning and implementation capacity of potential beneficiary associations and of FUMAC&#13;
and FUMAC-P Councils established under the project; and (b) to direct technical&#13;
assistance to the Paraiba PCU and State Planning Secretariat in specific areas, such as&#13;
specialized skills training and technical assistance for State reform. Since the component&#13;
is not tied to the subproject cycle, communities and Municipal Councils can receive&#13;
assistance independent of whether they have an approved subproject or approved portfolio&#13;
of subprojects, respectively. The resources of the Institutional Development component&#13;
would finance a variety of capacity-building programs, such as:&#13;
(a)   Mobilization assistance to beneficiary associations: the PCU (for PAC) and&#13;
Municipal Councils (for FUMAC and FUMAC-P) would formulate and&#13;
fund strategies to extend mobilization assistance to those communities&#13;
lacking in organization and thus not initially in a position to benefit from&#13;
the project. Such assistance would include community workshops to&#13;
determine priority needs, training to community groups in organization&#13;
skils and helping them with the process of forming legal associations, etc.;&#13;
(b)   Introductory Municipal Council training program: the PCU would organize&#13;
this program to train, either directly or through collaborative arrangements&#13;
with other entities, FUMAC and FUMAC-P Municipal Councils on the&#13;
project philosophy, subproject cycle and Operational Manual guidelines;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-86 -                           Annex E&#13;
and, more specifically for the FUMAC-P Councils, on the preparation of&#13;
annual operating plans (POAs), budgeting and administration;&#13;
(c)   Specialized skills training: the PCU, the project Councils, and groups of&#13;
community associations, would receive, on a demand basis, practical "on-&#13;
the-job training" in areas such as monitoring techniques, environmental&#13;
impact assessments, financial administration, as well as specific technical&#13;
topics in support of subproject implementation and operation and&#13;
maintenance (e.g., for groups of community associations on water use);&#13;
(d)   Standard subproject design training: standardized subprojects (Annex G)&#13;
will reduce the need for intensive technical assistance in subproject&#13;
preparation for the majority of subproject types requested by communities.&#13;
The standard subproject models are especially helpful to communities&#13;
lacking experience in subproject preparation. Workshops organized with&#13;
community associations, community leaders and project Municipal&#13;
Councils would provide technical assistance in the application and use of&#13;
standard subproject designs;&#13;
(e)   "Best Practice" exchanges: the PCU and Municipal Councils would arrange&#13;
for technical exchanges among community associations with similar types&#13;
of subprojects. These exchanges have proven to be an effective way to&#13;
transfer know-how on subproject operation and maintenance from&#13;
community associations with successful subprojects to associations&#13;
initiating new subprojects. In addition, exchanges among Municipal&#13;
Councils within the state and among PCUs throughout the Northeast could&#13;
be financed to disseminate successful experiences across states; and&#13;
(f)   Technical assistance for State reform. Because the fiscal situation of the&#13;
State affects both project implementation and state counterpart funding,&#13;
technical assistance at the state level is needed to analyze issues&#13;
surrounding the reform of the State and to identify measures to improve&#13;
the State's capacity to overcome fiscal crisis and address its underlying&#13;
causes. The State Secretariat of Planning (SEPLAN), through the PCU,&#13;
will have access to technical assistance funds for consultant services and&#13;
studies required for administrative and other state reforms.&#13;
3.    For access to funds from the Institutional Development component, the PCU and&#13;
each project Municipal Council would prepare, as part of the Annual Operating Plan&#13;
(POA), a TA and training proposal indicating proposed beneficiaries (by type), numbers of&#13;
activities (e.g., events, consultants, etc.), expected subject matter and estimated costs.&#13;
The aggregate dollar amount of technical assistance included in each proposal would be&#13;
based on a series of parameters, such as the number of subprojects expected, the estimated&#13;
number of new Municipal Councils, the estimated number of communities needing&#13;
mobilization assistance or general technical support, etc. During the course of the year,&#13;
each actual TA and training event would require detailed terms of reference, outlining the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -                          Annex E&#13;
objective and contents of each event. The PCU would provide the Municipal Councils&#13;
with a framework for the annual technical assistance and training proposals and with&#13;
model terms of reference to facilitate their access to the funds under the Institutional&#13;
Development component.&#13;
4.    Types of contracts under the Institutional Development component would range&#13;
from short-term contracts for single training events, to longer-term retainer contracts for a&#13;
series of training or technical assistance activities to be performed over a period of time.&#13;
For example, project Municipal Councils may contract the services of a local extension&#13;
agent to follow-up and provide TA to all community subprojects within the municipality.&#13;
Also, training in basic accounting and recordkeeping may be needed by a number of&#13;
community associations with productive subprojects and would best be handled by having&#13;
the PCU contract a specialized NGO to conduct in situ training with various community&#13;
associations over a certain period of time. The flexibility of contract types reflects the&#13;
diversity of TA and training needs of the various entities participating in the project.&#13;
However, to reduce the administrative task of processing a series of contracts and to take&#13;
advantage of economies of scale, technical assistance and training events would be&#13;
packaged whenever possible.&#13;
5.    The funds for institutional development at the project level will be administered by&#13;
the PCU, which will contract all technical assistance and training for the PAC program&#13;
and, in cases of packaging or upon request by the Municipal Councils, for the FUMAC&#13;
program. FUMAC and FUMAC-P Municipal Councils may contract technical assistance&#13;
and training for themselves or, upon request, for beneficiary associations, with the&#13;
assistance of the PCU and on the basis of standard terms of reference. The PCU would&#13;
monitor the use of institutional development funds by the Municipal Councils and by&#13;
beneficiary associations through review of statements of expenditure (SOEs) and periodic&#13;
supervision.&#13;
6.    Percentage of subproject cost targeted to technical assistance. At the&#13;
discretion of community associations, subproject proposals may include, as part of the&#13;
subproject cost, an allocation for technical assistance in preparation and/or implementation&#13;
of the subproject. The percentage, to be determined by the Municipal Councils in the case&#13;
of FUMAC or FUMAC-P and by the PCU in the case of PAC, would vary from 2% to&#13;
8% of the subproject cost. It would depend on the technical complexity of the subproject,&#13;
on whether a standard design already exists for the type of subproject under consideration,&#13;
and on other factors.&#13;
7.    Technical assistance and training financed as a percentage of the subproject cost,&#13;
would need to be described in detail in the subproject proposal. For TA during subproject&#13;
preparation, the service provider would necessarily work in an "at-risk" situation, since&#13;
TA services provided would be paid only if the subproject is indeed approved and funded&#13;
under the project. However, to avoid the risk of hampering the provision --under this&#13;
mode- of technical assistance for subproject preparation, community associations have&#13;
the option of requesting Municipal Councils to use resources from the institutional&#13;
development component instead to contract the required assistance. If the subproject is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-88 -                            Annex E&#13;
approved, funds for technical assistance provided as a percentage of subproject cost&#13;
would be disbursed directly to the beneficiary association. The association would contract&#13;
the extensionist/entity under procurement procedures acceptable to the Bank and&#13;
described in the Operational Manual. For "turn-key"-type contracts, where the technical&#13;
assistance provider helps prepare and then implement the subproject, a smaller percentage&#13;
would be paid for the preparation assistance vis-a-vis the implementation assistance, in&#13;
order to direct the financial incentive toward the successfiul implementation of the&#13;
subproject.&#13;
8.    For greater effectiveness, technical assistance for subprojects should extend into&#13;
the post-implementation (i.e., operation and maintenance) period, particularly for&#13;
productive subprojects where success depends on the association's capacity to operate&#13;
and administer its small-scale, communal activity. Therefore, as a prerequisite for&#13;
approval of productive subprojects, community associations would have to provide a&#13;
satisfactory technical assistance plan with the service provider identified. In addition, as&#13;
part of their commitment to sufficiently operate and maintain their subprojects, beneficiary&#13;
associations should include technical assistance among the expenditures to be financed out&#13;
of the O&amp;M funds maintained by each association. The PCU and project Municipal&#13;
Councils would actively encourage this practice during routine monitoring and&#13;
supervision.&#13;
SERVICE PROVIDERS&#13;
9.    The identification and mobilization of technical assistance and training providers is&#13;
a crucial complement to the availability of resources. The most important providers of&#13;
technical assistance would continue to be the PCU and the project Municipal Councils.&#13;
Other service providers are readily identifiable from their participation in the reformulated&#13;
NRDP:&#13;
(a)   Multilateral and bilateral technical assistance agencies -- international&#13;
technical assistance organizations contracted by the PCU can provide&#13;
technical assistance to the PCU itself and to the Municipal Councils at the&#13;
project level;&#13;
(b)   EMATER extensionists -- in each municipality, local accredited agents of&#13;
the state rural extension agency (EMATER) would be identified by the&#13;
PCU, to be contracted by individual community associations for work on a&#13;
particular subproject, or by Municipal Councils, on a retainer contract, for&#13;
clearly-specified work with a group of communities. As a rule, the project&#13;
would channel resources (only for incremental operating costs, not salaries)&#13;
directly to local extensionists rather than to the central, state-level agency,&#13;
in order to stimulate greater local participation, reward effective agents and&#13;
penalize those that do not effectively provide the assistance needed; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-89 -                            Annex E&#13;
(c)   Non-Governmental Organizations -- staff from local grassroots&#13;
organizations can also serve as accredited agents, as described in the&#13;
-paragraph above, or the NGOs themselves can enter into contracts with&#13;
associations, the Municipal Councils or the PCU for global or specific&#13;
technical assistance and training activities.&#13;
10.   The PCU and Municipal Councils would be charged with developing lists and&#13;
contacting all potential sources of technical assistance, such as: university students, local&#13;
private organizations, private extensionists, and state agencies. These lists would be&#13;
updated annually and would be available at the local level.&#13;
IMPLEMENTATION APRANGEMENTS&#13;
l.   To create institutional incentives in the PCU to promote accountability for TA and&#13;
training activities, technical assistance would need to be a more visible and effective line&#13;
function within the PCU. A high-level Technical Assistance Coordinator, to be nominated&#13;
from among the staff of the PCU, would be responsible for overseeing the Institutional,&#13;
Development component as well as the technical assistance arrangem-ents forming part of&#13;
subproject funds (as described above). The main tasks of the Coordinator would be to:&#13;
(a) develop the technical assistance and training framework under the project; (b) identify&#13;
and contact potential technical assistance providers and maintain updated lists for each&#13;
municipality and for the project as a whole; (c) identify and prepare potential local&#13;
accredited agents; (d) prepare the annual TA and training proposal for the project; (e)&#13;
assist the Municipal Councils in the preparation of the annual TA and training proposals&#13;
and review the proposals presented by each Municipal Council; (f) develop model terms of&#13;
reference for specific technical assistance activities and training events; (g) encourage&#13;
replication of successfid technical assistance and training activities wherever possible; and,&#13;
(h) based on supervision findings, measure and report on the progress of technical&#13;
assistance arrangements and their effectiveness.&#13;
12.   As part of their regular supervision efforts, the PCU and the Municipal Councils&#13;
would monitor the frequency and quality of technical assistance and training provided to&#13;
each subproject. SOEs presented by Municipal Councils and community associations for&#13;
technical assistance and training expenditures would be closely monitored by the PCU to&#13;
ensure that resources are used exclusively for that purpose and in a cost-effective manner.&#13;
As further incentive for their effective use, loan funds allocated to the Institutional&#13;
Development component will not be permitted to be re-allocated to finance community&#13;
subprojects or any other expenditure under the project. To give Municipal Councils&#13;
greater incentive to promote and achieve successful technical assistance arrangements in&#13;
their respective municipalities, the provision of technical assistance, both by the Councils&#13;
and other providers, would be considered a parameter by which to judge the overall&#13;
performance of project Municipal Councils and would factor into decision-making on the&#13;
promotion of FUMAC Councils to FUMAC-P. Technical assistance would also be&#13;
monitored through the project's monitoring and reporting arrangements (see Annex H).&#13;
Information from the MIS would identify active technical assistance contracts which will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-90 -                           Annex E&#13;
then be followed up during subproject supervision visits. The mid-year and annual project&#13;
progress reports, compiled by the PCU for the Bank, would contain specific sections&#13;
pertaining to the quantity, quality and effectiveness of technical assistance provided. The&#13;
project implementation review (Annex H) would also evaluate the quality and cost-&#13;
effectiveness of technical assistance and thus provide the beneficiaries' assessment of TA&#13;
arrangements. The Bank's Recife Office would evaluate the project's technical assistance&#13;
arrangements during regular supervision visits.&#13;

BRAZIL&#13;
RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT - PARAIBA&#13;
F. THE FUMAC-P PILOT PROGRAM&#13;
BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    Decentralization of decision-making and the transfer of project implementation&#13;
responsibilities from the State to the local (municipal and community) levels, started under&#13;
the reformulated NRDP with the introduction of the community-based PAC and FUMAC&#13;
programs, wili be further advanced in the proposed project. First, FUMAC coverage will&#13;
expand significantly under the project to cover over 130 municipalities by the fifth year of&#13;
implementation. Second, a further step towards decentralization will be taken through a&#13;
pilot program, FUMAC-P, which will promote the transfer of financial management&#13;
responsibilities to selected FUMAC Municipal Councils.&#13;
2.    Generally, municipalities which participated in FUMAC under the reformulated&#13;
NRDP tend to be those in which the environment for participatory decision-making is&#13;
more favorable, which distinguishes them from more traditionally-run municipalities with a&#13;
strong "cfientelistic" approach. This environment has been the result of a conjunction of&#13;
cultural/political factors, such as the emergence of a movement for the development of&#13;
civil society (usually induced by religious organizations, NGOs and more recently by some&#13;
political parties) and the coming to power of a new generation of more open-minded&#13;
political leaders.&#13;
3.    Several important lessons have emerged from the FUMAC experience under the&#13;
reformulated NRDP. First, it proved to be an efficient, transparent approach for&#13;
identifying and prioritizing, through local-level consensus building, multiple demands for&#13;
investments by needy conununities. Second, it provided the opportunity to experiment not&#13;
only with increased transfer of decision-making, including approval of subprojects, from&#13;
the state Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) to Municipal Councils representing&#13;
communities, but also with the management of community subproject funds by these very&#13;
Councils. This experience is reflected in the proposed project in the design of FUMAC&#13;
and, in particular, FUMAC-P, where the feasibility of financial management at the&#13;
grassroots level will be tested.&#13;
FUMAC-P: MAIN FEATURES&#13;
4.    The FUMAC-P pilot would account, initially, for about US$7.1 million or 9% of&#13;
the total base cost of the project over the five-year implementation period. In order to&#13;
motivate project Municipal Councils (both FUMAC and FUMAC-P) and have them&#13;
participate in the project in a sustainable manner, each Council --and its communities--&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-92 -                           Annex F&#13;
would benefit from a minimum of 5 subprojects per year. The initial amount allocated to&#13;
this subcomponent is therefore expected to allow the installation of some 20 FUMAC-P&#13;
Councils by the end of the project period. If this pilot approach proves successful with the&#13;
communities and meets its objectives of local-level investment selection, execution and&#13;
financi management, FUMAC-P would be expanded with funds initially earmarked for&#13;
the FUMAC and PAC subcomponents (see para. 10) and more FUMAC-P Councils than&#13;
initially foreseen could be set up during project implementation.&#13;
5.   Initially, the PCU would select FUMAC-P municipalities from among the best&#13;
FUMAC performers under the reformulated NRDP, i.e., those with the best record in&#13;
administering and executing community subprojects. Additionally, other municipalities&#13;
which have a favorable enviromnent for participatory work (extensive community&#13;
organization, municipal officials open to participative decision-making, etc.), and are&#13;
interested and can commit themselves to following project guidelines, could be included.&#13;
There should also be some indication that local capacity exists to manage financial&#13;
resources, for instance in communities or existing associations already managing small-&#13;
scale businesses (on an individual or group basis) and whose members could potentially&#13;
form part of FUMAC-P Municipal Councils. As the proposed project gets underway, and&#13;
the FUMAC-P approach proves successful, other well-performing FUMAC municipalities&#13;
could gradually be upgraded into FUMAC-P municipalities.&#13;
6.    Once the municipalities are selected, allocation of funds would be done based on a&#13;
number of criteria to which different weights will be assigned. These criteria may include&#13;
several of the foliowing:&#13;
(a)   ratio of rural to total population;&#13;
(b)   rate of indigence;&#13;
(c)   number and degree of dispersion of poor rural communities;&#13;
(d)   availability of public resources per capita;&#13;
(e): number of subprojects approved under the reformulated NRDP (small&#13;
discriminatory factor);&#13;
-(t)   performance-in. e previous year; and&#13;
(g)   williness of the mayor (prefeito) to participate.&#13;
7.    FUMAC-P Municipal Councils would have the same composition and modes of&#13;
operation as FUMAC Municipal Councils (Annex D). They would be responsible for:&#13;
(a)   assisting rural communities in identifying priority needs and translating&#13;
them into investment proposals;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -                         Annex F&#13;
(b)   screening and reviewing these proposals, and ensuring that they meet&#13;
eligibility criteria as contained in the Project Operational Manual;&#13;
(c)   monitoring and supervising, together with the PCU, the implementation of&#13;
approved subprojects;&#13;
(d)   providing, directly or through contracting, technical assistance and training&#13;
to beneficiary associations in the design and operation and maintenance of&#13;
project-financed investments;&#13;
(e)   managing subproject funds and transferring funds to beneficiary&#13;
associations with approved subprojects; and&#13;
(f)   preparing indicative annual operating plans (POAs) for review and&#13;
approval by the PCU. The POA would contain a list of community&#13;
investment priorities, indicative targets to be met, a tentative timetable, the&#13;
indicative budget and the technical assistance required to implement the&#13;
proposed program. The PCU would review and approve the POA at the&#13;
end of the year preceding implementation.&#13;
8.    An agreement (convenio) between the PCU and the Municipal Council would&#13;
establish the terms and conditions as well as rights and obligations of each party with&#13;
respect to the release and use of the approved funds. These (both loan and state&#13;
counterpart funds) would be deposited into an account in a commercial bank, and would&#13;
be withdrawn solely upon formal order by the Municipal Council. The Council would&#13;
screen community subproject proposals on the basis of the approved POA and the funds&#13;
made available by the PCU. An agreement (convinio) between the Municipal Council and&#13;
the beneficiary association would be required.&#13;
9.    Regular supervision of the operations of the FUMAC-P Municipal Councils would&#13;
be the responsibility of the PCU, focusing in particular on the administrative and financial&#13;
arrangements made by the Councils to effectively control and release project funds to the&#13;
community associations and on progress in the implementation of the POA agreed for&#13;
each FUMAC-P Council. Municipal Councils would be aided in their tasks, both for&#13;
management and accounting as well as subproject appraisal, monitoring and supervision,&#13;
by appropriate technical assistance under the guidance of the PCU. Unsatisfactory&#13;
performance of a Council would have to be carefully assessed by the PCU, including, if&#13;
necessary, the weighing of penalties. If unsatisfactory performance is not rapidly&#13;
corrected, it would lead to a reduction of the budget envelope allocated to the Council the&#13;
following year (para. 6) or, in the case of serious wrongdoing such as misappropriation or&#13;
misuse of funds, to legal remedies, combined with restructuring of the Council or its&#13;
downgrading from FUMAC-P back to FUMAC. On the other hand, built-in incentives&#13;
would encourage positive performance. Positive performance, for example, would be&#13;
rewarded with a potential expansion in the budget envelope allocated each year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-94-                            Annex F&#13;
10.   The project implementation review to be carried out at mid-term would include a&#13;
specific evaluation of the FUMAC-P program. The basic purpose of this evaluation will&#13;
be to assess performance under the pilot program and, where necessary, adjust its design&#13;
and mechanisms in order to improve its procedures and impact on beneficiaries. If the&#13;
pilot program is found successful and its expansion is justified, part of the remaining PAC&#13;
and FUMAC fuinds under the project could be transferred to the FlUMAC-P program for&#13;
implementation in the final project years.&#13;

RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT - PARAIBA&#13;
G. STANDARD DESIGNS AND OPERATION AND&#13;
MAINTENANCE OF SUBPROJECTS&#13;
STANDARD DESIGNS&#13;
1.    Experience under the NRDP showed that the technical elaboration of subprojects&#13;
can be a difficult task for rural community associations. In some cases, especially where&#13;
competent technical assistance is not available locally, this resulted in inappropriate design,&#13;
cost overruns and subprojects left incomplete or unoperational. Under the proposed&#13;
project, preparation of subprojects by associations, as well as appraisal of the technical&#13;
proposals by Municipal Councils and/or the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU), will be&#13;
facilitated with the adoption of standard designs developed by the PCU for the most&#13;
common types of subprojects found in Paraiba. The use of standard designs will ensure&#13;
that, at least for those subprojects most in demand by communities, project investments&#13;
foflow recommended technical specifications, both for construction and operation and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M), meet reasonable cost parameters so as to be financially viable, and&#13;
comply with all necessary environmental requirements. At the same time, the risk of&#13;
"directing" community demand towards subprojects for which standard designs will be&#13;
made available would be reduced by the project's information campaign which advises&#13;
communities, inter alia, about the variety of subprojects that are eligible for financing.&#13;
2.    Different standard designs or appropriate standard documentation (projetos-&#13;
padr&amp;o orprojetos de referencia) will be prepared for the various types of investments:&#13;
productive, infrastructure and social subprojects. The main items to be included in each of&#13;
the relevant documentation are indicated below.&#13;
3.    For productive subprojects:&#13;
(a)   a summary of the existing situation, including considerations on demand,&#13;
supply of raw materials, as well as markets;&#13;
(b)   a set of considerations and parameters to carry out simplified feasibility&#13;
studies, in particular: a presentation of subproject objectives and potential&#13;
benefits; the technical production process and type of equipment required;&#13;
technical parameters such as expected yields, coefficient of utilization,&#13;
range of output; range of costs of production, depreciation, maintenance&#13;
requirements; expected benefits and number of beneficiaries; indicative&#13;
internal rates of return, benefit/cost ratios, and other such indicators;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -                           Annex G&#13;
(c)   technical aspects, including a description of civil works, technical&#13;
specifications, bill of quantities, and the list of suppliers of equipment&#13;
required to operate the subproject;&#13;
(d)   guidelines for O&amp;M; and&#13;
(e)   environmental considerations and recommendations for specific measures&#13;
to mitigate the negative impact, if any, of the proposed subproject.&#13;
In addition, a set of operating rules (regulamento de uso) will accompany the&#13;
documentation for each of the proposed productive subprojects.&#13;
4.    For social subprojects:&#13;
(a)   a methodology for establishing the profile of social demand in order to&#13;
properly tailor the size of the required facility;&#13;
(b)   design considerations, e.g., services to be delivered by the proposed&#13;
subproject, and technical, legal and administrative aspects;&#13;
(c)   technical aspects as for productive subprojects;&#13;
(d)   O&amp;M features, including an evaluation of the delivery costs of the&#13;
proposed social service; and&#13;
(e)   environmental considerations where relevant.&#13;
5.    For infrastructure subprojects, whose size can vary widely depending on the local&#13;
context, intended number of beneficiaries and other factors, the concept of standard design&#13;
as such is not totally adequate. However, it is possible to develop:&#13;
(a)   generic terms of reference for engineering of different types of subprojects,&#13;
e.g., water supply systems, road rehabilitation, etc.; and&#13;
(b)   "typical" engineering (projetos tipicos) of small works such as pipes and&#13;
box culverts, retaining walls, typical decks for small bridges, etc.&#13;
6.    Standard designs will be available for those types of subprojects that most respond&#13;
to the needs and demand of communities. By project effectiveness, a first group of ten&#13;
standard designs will have been prepared by the PCU, and listed in the project Operational&#13;
Manual, for the following most popular types of subprojects: rural electrification, various&#13;
communal water supply systems, fords (passagem molhada), communal wash-houses,&#13;
multi-purpose community centers, communal warehouses, sheep/goat raising, manioc&#13;
mills, sanitation facilities. While these standard designs would be continuously reviewed&#13;
and adjusted, others, depending on demand, would be elaborated by the PCU for&#13;
additional types of subprojects that would be requested by a relatively large number of&#13;
communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-97 -                           Annex G&#13;
7.    Careful field supervision and monitoring of standard subprojects by the PCU will&#13;
be necessary in order to: (a) avoid mistakes to be replicated on a large scale, and (b) fine-&#13;
tune and adjust the standard designs that have been developed. The need for the different&#13;
participating states to share experience on standard designs of subprojects has also been&#13;
identified. In particular, those that have been prepared by the first six states participating&#13;
in the Northeast Rural Poverty Alleviation Program (Bahia, Ceara and others) could be&#13;
shared by Paraiba. Workshops should be arranged in which standard subproject&#13;
documentation developed by the different states would be used for discussions to compare&#13;
and evaluate the different solutions that have been found to the same problem.&#13;
OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE&#13;
8.    Although the reformulated NRDP financed many of the same types of community&#13;
investments (e.g., manioc mills or small-scale rural water supply projects) that have been&#13;
supported under past programs or projects in the Northeast, one of its innovative features&#13;
was to ensure that these investments are operated and maintained by the beneficiaries&#13;
themselves, thereby enhancing their sense of ownership and the prospects for sustainability&#13;
of the investments. Under the proposed project, this feature will be maintained and&#13;
strengthened.&#13;
9.    Community associations will bear the primary responsibility for O&amp;M for most&#13;
project-funded investments, and this provision will be included in the agreements&#13;
(convWnios) with the associations. The relative responsibilities of the associations for&#13;
O&amp;M would vary according to the type of investment. As a general rule, beneficiaries&#13;
would be fully responsible for operating and maintaining their own productive subprojects&#13;
and some social subprojects, such as community or day care centers. In the case of most&#13;
infrastructure and other types of subprojects, the responsibility for O&amp;M would normally&#13;
be shared between the communities and the relevant State or municipal institution. In&#13;
exceptional cases of relatively complex subprojects, beneficiary associations might&#13;
contract private firms or NGOs to assist them in O&amp;M tasks.&#13;
10.   Based on experience under the reformulated NRDP, several types of arrangements&#13;
would be implemented in order to ensure the financial sustainability of project investments,&#13;
as follows:&#13;
11.   Productive Subprojects (e.g., small-scale irrigation schemes, co"m'munal cereals&#13;
processing, manioc mills, etc.). Once a subproject has been approved for financing, the&#13;
beneficiary association elects a committee to be in charge of subproject implementation&#13;
and management. This committee has the task, among others, of determining the different&#13;
dues and user fees to be charged to association members (as well as to non-association&#13;
members using project facilities), based on estimated requirements for O&amp;M and capital&#13;
replacement or eventual expansion. User fees have to be approved by all association&#13;
members, and may be paid in cash, labor or kind, depending on the particular situation.&#13;
The committee is responsible for collecting the fees, placing them in a "reserve fund",&#13;
managing the reserve fund to meet extraordinary maintenance and capital replacement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -                          Annex G&#13;
requirements, and making payments for recurrent expenditures such as electricity&#13;
consumption, fuel, inputs, repairs, and employees' salaries.&#13;
12.   Social Subprojects (e.g., community centers, sanitation, health-related house&#13;
improvement, day care centers, school or health post rehabilitation). The degree of&#13;
community involvement in the O&amp;M of social subprojects depends on the type of&#13;
investment. In the case of subprojects related to public services, such as health posts or&#13;
schools, the municipality or relevant public/private entity could undertake O&amp;M foliowing&#13;
an agreement with the community. For other types of subprojects such as community&#13;
centers or house improvement, the community will be responsible for O&amp;M, each of the&#13;
community members contributing either financially or in the form of labor.&#13;
13.  Infrastructure Subprojects (e.g., small bridges, water supply systems, fords,&#13;
road repairs). Different arrangements are to be followed for O&amp;M of infrastructure&#13;
subprojects. In the case of services (e.g., water supply) connected to individual&#13;
households, beneficiaries could transfer the corresponding assets to the relevant state or&#13;
municipal utility company, which then undertakes O&amp;M and recovers costs through user&#13;
fees. Simplified water supply systems (without connection to households) will be&#13;
operated and maintained by the community itself, which makes arrangements for collection&#13;
of dues or fees from individual community members to pay for O&amp;M expenses. These&#13;
arrangements are commonly found in the rural water supply subprojects financed under&#13;
the reformulated NRDP. For infrastructure subprojects such as rural roads, bridges, and&#13;
street paving, which serve a larger public, responsibility for O&amp;M would normally be&#13;
shared with the municipality under agreement with the beneficiary association.&#13;

H. PROJECT MONITORING, REPORTING AND&#13;
EVALUATION&#13;
PROJECTr MONiTORING&#13;
1.    The establishment of an efficient project monitoring system will be instrumental in&#13;
following the progression of the investment program financed by the proposed Paraiba&#13;
Rural Poverty Alleviation Project and ascertaining its consistency with project objectives.&#13;
Project implementation relies heavily on a decentralized system of decision-making and&#13;
management, and is driven by demand from rural community associations which is filtered&#13;
through a selection process based on established criteria. This process involves a large&#13;
number of small, diverse subprojects over an extensive geographic area. Hence, since the&#13;
ex ante determination of the pattern of project investment and other key parameters is not&#13;
possible, effective supervision depends on the existence of a capable monitoring system.&#13;
2.    The objectives of the project monitoring system are to:&#13;
(a)   provide information regarding the progress of the project and the status of&#13;
the subproject cycle in its different stages (e.g., subproject approval,&#13;
procurement, implementation and disbursement); and&#13;
(b)   verify that project activities are consistent with the guidelines, targeting&#13;
methodology and selection criteria included in the Project Operational&#13;
Manual.&#13;
Project Database&#13;
3.    The project monitoring system would depend on a Management Information&#13;
System (MIS), created under the reformulated NRDP and to be improved under the&#13;
project.' The project MIS is a data base organized in three general levels: (a) a&#13;
subproject information module, which contains pertinent physical and financial information&#13;
for each subproject; (b) a financial management module, from which Statements of&#13;
Expenditure (SOEs) are generated; and (c) a project management module, from which all&#13;
project reports are generated. Under the proposed project, the MIS will operate as a&#13;
network to facilitate the inputting of information and provide access to up-to-the-minute&#13;
information by all levels of project management, tailored to individual needs.&#13;
Under the reformulated NRDP, this system was referred to as the SSMP, or Simplified Project&#13;
Monitoring System.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-100-                           Annex H&#13;
4.    For the State of Paraiba, the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) would be&#13;
responsible for operating and maintaining the MIS and for providing the input&#13;
corresponding to PAC subprojects. The project Municipal Councils would be responsible&#13;
for completing the data sheets for FUMAC and FUMAC-P subprojects and, upon&#13;
completion of each data sheet, would present them to the PCU which would subsequently&#13;
update the MIS.&#13;
5.    The subproject module is the basic module into which all information collected&#13;
from the subprojects is entered and processed. Subproject information feeds into both the&#13;
financial management module and the project management module. Subprojects are&#13;
identified and entered in the MIS according to the following format. Information for the&#13;
MIS is obtained from data sheets for each subproject and separated into four submodules&#13;
which correspond to key steps of the subproject cycle:&#13;
(a)   Submodule No. 1 would include information for the subproject regarding&#13;
its location and identification, according to the following format: (i) by&#13;
program [PAC, FUMAC, and FUMAC-P]; (ii) by type [Infrastructure,&#13;
Productive and Social subprojects]; (iii) by category [e.g., water supply,&#13;
agro-processing, energy, etc.]; (iv) by sub-category, in particular for water&#13;
supply subprojects [e.g., dams, wells, tanks, etc.]; and (v) by location&#13;
[municipality, community and beneficiary association];&#13;
(b)   Submodule No. 2 would include the technical, social and financial&#13;
characteristics, as well as a set of indicators such as cost/capita, cost/n2,&#13;
and other parameters to the subproject budget;&#13;
(c)   Submodule No. 3 would include information on subproject implementation,&#13;
including procurement procedures and contracting, all disbursement data,&#13;
including beneficiary and municipal government contributions to&#13;
counterpart funding, and provision of technical assistance and training to&#13;
the community association in question; and&#13;
(d)   Submodule No. 4 would include subproject completion information,&#13;
including beneficiary numbers and relevant subproject impacts (e.g.,&#13;
production figures, income generated, etc.).&#13;
6.    The information input into the MIS would come from standard data sheets of three&#13;
types: (a) subproject data sheet; (b)3 supervision data sheet; and (c) graduation data sheet.&#13;
The subproject data sheet, completed by the PCU (for PAC) and the Municipal Councils&#13;
(for FUMAC and FUMAC-P) would supply the basic information on the subproject&#13;
stemming from the subproject proposal. The supervision data sheet would verify and/or&#13;
update information on the subproject data sheet, identifyr any implementation problems and&#13;
possible mitigating measures, and report relevant subproject impacts. The supervision&#13;
data sheets would be completed by the PCU and Municipal Councils, or by those entities&#13;
subcontracted to provide supervision services, in which case the supervision data sheets&#13;
would be included in the TORs. Finally, the graduation data sheets would include&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-101 -                          Annex H&#13;
information on the community itself, including existing infrastructure and other indicators&#13;
of community well-being (see Annex C), to be filled out by the beneficiary community&#13;
associations as part of their subproject proposals, and verified and/or updated by the PCU,&#13;
Municipal Councils, or subcontracted participating agencies.&#13;
7.    Given the 2,840 subprojects estimated to be financed during the five years of&#13;
project implementation, the MIS is an essential tool for following the course of project&#13;
investment. Information from the MIS is also fundamental to measure compliance with,&#13;
and subsequent effectiveness of, the project's targeting mechanisms. By monitoring the&#13;
direction of project benefits and types of subprojects being financed, the PCU and the&#13;
Municipal Councils can direct appropriate technical assistance and training based on the&#13;
frequency of certain types of investment or target community mobilization activities.&#13;
Cases of mistargeting or misappropriation of funds -- resources channeled outside the&#13;
project area or for ineligible investments -- will be verified using the MIS in order for&#13;
appropriate remedies to be applied.&#13;
Monitoring Activities&#13;
8.    Within the framework of the project monitoring system, the PCU and the project&#13;
Municipal Councils (under FUMAC and FUMAC-P) are responsible for supervising the&#13;
application of the guidelines from the Operational Manual in the development and&#13;
implementation of all subprojects. Using the information from the MIS, combined with&#13;
field visits and inputs from project supervision reports, project-contracted studies and&#13;
audits, the PCU and the Municipal Councils would monitor project characteristics and&#13;
trends, identify implementation problems and accomplishments and undertake or promote&#13;
appropriate actions to improve project implementation (see Annex K on Project&#13;
Supervision). The MIS will also serve as a basis from which to derive Annual Operating&#13;
Plans (POAs), regulate their implementation, and make necessary adjustments to the&#13;
POAs and corresponding budgets during the course of each fiscal year. The delineation of&#13;
monitoring responsibilities between the PCU and the Municipal Councils would be clearly&#13;
reflected in the Project Operational Manual.&#13;
PROJECT REPORTING&#13;
9.    The PCU is responsible for reporting on project progress to the Bank. Four types&#13;
of reports would be generated by the PCU and presented to the Bank:&#13;
(a)   a copy of the content of the MIS data base on diskette would be provided&#13;
on a monthly basis to the Bank's Field Office in Recife. The information&#13;
from the MIS will facilitate Bank supervision efforts and monitoring of the&#13;
investment program;&#13;
(b)   an MIS-generated report which would include the updated status of project&#13;
implementation (USPI) and an updated list of subprojects with their&#13;
physical, procurement and disbursement status would be provided to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-102-                           Annex H&#13;
Bank's Field Office in Recife at the same time that the statements of&#13;
expenditure (SOEs) are sent to Bank Headquarters. The USPI and&#13;
subproject list will permit the Recife Office to review the eligibility of&#13;
subprojects presented for reimbursement;&#13;
(c)   a Mid-year Project Progress Report, using standard formats agreed with&#13;
the Bank, would be presented by July 31 of each year of project&#13;
implementation; and&#13;
(d)   an Annual Report would be presented by January 31 of each year of project&#13;
implementation. The Annual Report would use the standard formats from&#13;
the mid-year report but would also include a comprehensive review of: (i)&#13;
the status of.the project performance indicators and the specific activities of&#13;
the institutional development component; (ii) subproject appraisal&#13;
indicators, the status of the targeting of project benefits, the application of&#13;
subproject investment eligibility criteria, and other implementation&#13;
guidelines included in the Operation Manual; and (iii) other relevant&#13;
analyses and recommendations from project-contracted studies and audits&#13;
which may be applied to improve project implementation.&#13;
PROJECT EVALUATION STUDIES&#13;
10.   The project would develop and implement a range of evaluation studies to measure&#13;
the impact of the subproject investments and to provide appropriate feedback to improve&#13;
project methodology and implementation. The PCU would be responsible for drafting&#13;
Terms of Reference (TORs), which would form part of the Project Operational Manual,&#13;
and contracting local and other consulting services, both steps in agreement with the&#13;
Bank, for the following studies: (a) annual physical performance reviews; (b) a mid-term&#13;
implementation review; and (c) a comprehensive impact evaluation. These studies are&#13;
described below. In addition, the project would finance a study to determine the point of&#13;
community graduation; details on this study are included in Annex C. During the course&#13;
of project implementation, the PCU may also identify, other needed evaluation studies&#13;
which can be financed under the project in agreement with the Bank.&#13;
Annual Physical Performance Reviews&#13;
11.   The objective of the Physical Performance Review (PPR) is to evaluate the success&#13;
of investments financed by the project, in terms of their achievement of specific subproject&#13;
objectives, and the quality, efficiency, and sustainability of the investments. For each&#13;
subproject included in the sample, the study would focus on the following points: (a) the&#13;
adequacy of the physical design in relation to the subproject's objective; (b) the quality and&#13;
cost of subproject execution; (c) the efficiency of procurement procedures used; and (e)&#13;
the targeting of project benefits. The PPR would provide indication of the effectiveness of&#13;
community-based procurement; compliance with and/or needed adjustments to cost&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-103 -                         Annex H&#13;
indicators and other physical/financial appraisal indicators and to the Standard Designs&#13;
included in the Operational Manual; and the quality of project investments and the profile&#13;
of distribution of project benefits. The PPR wilH also be an important input to the project's&#13;
implementation review and to project Annual Reports.&#13;
12.   The PPR will be conducted on the basis of TORs agreed with the Bank and&#13;
included in the Operational Manual. The first PPR will be conducted at the end of 1998&#13;
for a sample of subprojects representative of the prior year's investment program (PAC,&#13;
FUMAC, and FUMAC-P). To conduct the PPR, the PCU would: (a) establish, with&#13;
Bank agreement, the sample of subprojects to be reviewed; (b) supply counterparts to the&#13;
independent consultants contracted by the PCU to implement the study; (c) participate in&#13;
the diagnosis and generation of appropriate recommendations; and (d) incorporate the&#13;
recommendations into the implementation of the project. Subsequent PPRs would be&#13;
conducted each year and would review physical performance issues identified dunng the&#13;
first PPR and monitor improvements. TORs for the remaining PPRs would be agreed&#13;
with the Bank by no later than July 31 of each corresponding year.&#13;
13.  In addition, the first PPR will include a module to measure the quality and&#13;
efficiency of community procurement (direct contracting) of goods and works. Similar to&#13;
an audit, this module of the PPR would analyze the contracting procedures used and the&#13;
accompanying documentation for a sample of subprojects. The issues to be examined&#13;
would include: (a) the transparency of the contracting process; (b) if the goods/works&#13;
were procured at the lowest cost for the quality required and how these costs compare&#13;
with the unit cost references in the MIS; (c) in the case of technical assistance, if the&#13;
service providers contracted satisfied the profile and experience indicated in the TORs;&#13;
and (d) if the documentation maintained by the community association is sufficient to&#13;
complete Statements of Expenditure (SOEs) and to satisfy an audit.&#13;
Inplementation Review&#13;
14.   Project performance would be measured through an implementation review at the&#13;
mid-term of project implementation. The purpose of the implementation review is to&#13;
assist the State Government of Paraiba, the PCU and the Bank, in the identification of&#13;
positive experiences and implementation problems and bottlenecks, particularly in&#13;
FUMAC and FUJMAC-P, in order to recommend needed modifications to their&#13;
methodology and design. Importantly, since the FUMAC-P program is a pilot, this mid-&#13;
term review would determine its feasibility and recommend its expansion.&#13;
15.   The mid-term review would be carried out through beneficiary consultations--&#13;
interviews and group discussions. These consultations would determine, inter alia: (a)&#13;
how the project is perceived and valued by the actual beneficiaries; (b) the level of&#13;
community participation -- and any outside involvement (e.g., NGOs, EMATER, etc.) -&#13;
in the different stages of the subproject cycle, including in the process of prioritizing local&#13;
demands; (c) the effectiveness of the subprojects in alleviating poverty and its&#13;
consequences; (d) the access to and quality of technical assistance for the preparation,&#13;
implementation and O&amp;M of subprojects; (e) the role of the Municipal Councils, how&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-104 -                          Annex H&#13;
these Councils are perceived in the communities, and how decisions on prioritization are&#13;
effectively made; (f) the role of Mayors in decision-making and in actual project&#13;
implementation; (g) the operation and maintenance of subprojects; and (h) how the role&#13;
and performance of the PCU is viewed in the communities (for PAC). Additional&#13;
questions would evaluate the efficiency and impact of the different subcomponents (PAC,&#13;
FUMAC and FUMAC-P), the effectiveness of institutional development activities, the&#13;
level of community participation, and the ability of the project to target and reach the&#13;
poor. Overall, the beneficiary consultations would generate a reliable evaluation of project&#13;
performance and impact as seen through the eyes of the ultimate beneficiaries which&#13;
would serve as a convincing input to improve project implementation.&#13;
16.   The implementation review would be carried out in the third year of project&#13;
implementation with a sample of community associations drawn from FUMAC and&#13;
FUMAC-P municipalities, with a small residual sample drawn from PAC municipalities,&#13;
and a sample of Municipal Councils. The implementation review would be carried out by&#13;
independent consultants -- preferably a local organization with field experience -- under&#13;
TORs and contracting procedures agreed with the Bank. Inputs to the review process&#13;
would include: the mid-year and annual reports, MIS-generated analyses and reports,&#13;
results of the PPRs, recommendations from project audit reports, and additional reviews&#13;
or studies contracted by the PCU.&#13;
Project Impact Evaluation&#13;
17.   The project would also finance a baseline (year 1) and final (year 5) evaluation to&#13;
measure the socio-econornic impact of the subproject investments. This comprehensive&#13;
evaluation, based on a random sample survey of representative subproject types, would&#13;
select important socio-economic indicators, such as employment, income, health,&#13;
education, and migration, and measure the impact of subproject investments on these&#13;
indicators and consequently the impact of the project on the quality of life of the&#13;
beneficiary population, differentiating by gender where possible. The evaluation would&#13;
also relate impact back to specific aspects of the project in order to identify those&#13;
conditions or activities which have resulted in positive impacts.&#13;
18.   The evaluation study would also measure the effects of the project on the financial&#13;
situation at the municipal and state levels, due to the positive impacts on project&#13;
beneficiaries (communities and families). For example, the financing of subprojects for&#13;
community water supply implies savings for municipal governments, and even State and&#13;
Federal Governments, in drought periods by preempting the need of these governments to&#13;
finance temporary water provision to rural communities through carro pipa, typically a&#13;
significant expenditure for municipal governments of the Northeast and one which is not&#13;
made to the extent needed due to limited resources. The project would also generate&#13;
benefits in terms of improved health or, in general terms, in improved quality of life for&#13;
beneficiaries, which would result in savings for the State or municipal governments in&#13;
medical services, medicines, etc., furnished to rural communities. In addition, the project&#13;
produces products over which the State and municipal governments can collect taxes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-105-                           Annex H&#13;
(such as the ICMS tax on marketed production). These products can include not only&#13;
products generated by productive subprojects but also consumer goods (e.g. refrigerators,&#13;
radios, etc.) purchased by families benefiting from rural electrification subprojects.&#13;
Therefore, the study would evaluate the aggregate impact of the project at the State and&#13;
municipal levels, measring: (a) the savings permitted by the project, in terms of&#13;
expenditures for water supplied by carro pupa and provision of medical services, etc., that&#13;
no longer have to be made due to the project, and (b) the taxes generated by various types&#13;
of subprojects financed.&#13;
19.   As in the mid-term implementation review, the study would concentrate on&#13;
FUMAC and FUMAC-P municipalities, where the majority of project investments would&#13;
be located, and include a small sample of PAC municipalities, consistent with the project's&#13;
investment profile. The indicators would be identified and measured during the baseline&#13;
evaluation in the first year of project implementation, and assessed in the final evaluation&#13;
at the conclusion of implementation. The impact evaluation would be carried out by&#13;
independent consultants and contracted under TORs and procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Bank.&#13;
Implementation Plan and Project Perfonnance Indicators&#13;
20.   The implementation plan and project performance indicators for each project&#13;
component over the five-year implementation period were agreed upon during appraisal.&#13;
Given the demand-driven nature and flexibility of the project, these indicators will be&#13;
mostly indicative targets. They can be expected to be achieved at least in the initial year of&#13;
the project, but may well develop somewhat differently in subsequent years, particularly in&#13;
terms of the proportion that each main category of subprojects (infrastructure, social or&#13;
productive) would represent out of the total investments financed by the project.&#13;

RURAL POVERTY ALLEVIATION PROJECT - PARAIBA&#13;
J. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The project will assist the State Government of Paraiba to alleviate poverty and its&#13;
consequences by providing basic infrastructure, employment and income-generating&#13;
opportunities for the rural poor, decentralizing resource allocation and decision-making to&#13;
local levels, leveraging resources mobilized at the community and municipal levels and&#13;
expanding social capital in rural areas of the state. These objectives will be attained&#13;
through three project components--Community Subprojects (90% of total base cost),&#13;
Institutional Development (6% of total base costs) and Project Administration,&#13;
Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation (4% of total base costs).&#13;
2.    The demand-driven nature of the project implies that communities will determine&#13;
the nature and scope of each subproject funded. Accordingly, neither benefits nor costs&#13;
can be identified ex ante. As such, it is not possible to estimate an ex ante overall internal&#13;
economic rate of return for the project nor individually for the variety of potential&#13;
subprojects. The proposed Rural Poverty Alleviation project is a follow-up to the&#13;
reformulated NRDP (see perforrnance and impact evaluation in Annex B). Subprojects&#13;
intended to be funded under the proposed project would, in general, be similar to those&#13;
subprojects funded and completed under the previous project. Therefore, the experience&#13;
and ex post results of a sample of completed subprojects under the reformulated NRDP&#13;
can be examined, as internal rates of return and other economic parameters for subprojects&#13;
likely to be financed under the new project are not expected to differ greatly.&#13;
3.    Subprojects would be of many types, broadly classified as infrastructure (e.g.,&#13;
rural water supply, electrification, small roads and bridges), social (e.g., community&#13;
centers, sanitation) and productive (e.g., small-scale agro-processing and minor irrigation&#13;
schemes). Nmety percent of the total cost of the project (US$71.0 million) would support&#13;
matching grants for these subprojects. Bank funds will cover 75 percent of the total cost&#13;
of each subproject, with the remaining 25 percent consisting of counterpart funds from&#13;
state, municipal and community contributions. Of this 25 percent, approximately 10&#13;
percent is expected to come from the local community, either in cash or in-kind.&#13;
Subproject selection is demand-driven and based on community preferences. Subproject&#13;
proposals would observe standard documentation and technical, economic, environmental&#13;
and sustainability criteria established in a detailed Project Operational Manual, which sets&#13;
forth procedures and guidelines for implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-116-                             Annex J&#13;
Methodology and Assumptions&#13;
4.    In terms of the counterfactual, the project will support infrastructure and social&#13;
investments which, due to their public nature and the inappropriability of potential benefit&#13;
streams, are unlikely to be undertaken in sufficient quantities by the private sector.&#13;
Furthermore, while state, municipal and community counterpart contributions will total 25&#13;
percent of all subproject costs, it is doubtful that, in the absence of this project, the local&#13;
governments and communities would be financially capable of amassing the necessary&#13;
investment required to fund these projects, either due to poor rural financial intermediation&#13;
or generally low asset levels. Also, resource efficiency is improved through direct&#13;
community participation in the identification, selection and implementation of each&#13;
subproject proposal.&#13;
5.    While it is feasible to separate the three components of the project (i.e.,&#13;
Community Subprojects; Institutional Development; and Project Administration,&#13;
Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation), such a strategy would jeopardize the&#13;
achievement of project objectives. A project based solely on the provision of matching&#13;
grants for community subprojects would not address the need to simultaneously foster and&#13;
bolster the development of grass-roots institutions, such as the Municipal Councils created&#13;
under the project which review and approve the subproject proposals. While the overall&#13;
level of funding for institutional development is low (6 percent of total project costs),&#13;
these funds are vital to properly train and prepare these Councils for effective leadership in&#13;
their communities. Project Administration, Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation will&#13;
provide needed feedback on project performance and impact, as well as finance project&#13;
coordination.&#13;
6.    Complementarity among community subprojects makes a precise overall&#13;
quantitative analysis (i.e., economic IRR calculation) difficult. Simply put, the synergy&#13;
created from the interactive effects of several subprojects within any municipality is&#13;
difficult to capture and equally difficult to quantify. For example, rural electrification,&#13;
which accounted for about one-half of all subprojects funded under the reformulated&#13;
NRDP in Paralba, generates a variety of productive undertakings, such as irrigation in&#13;
previously rain-fed only regions, opening opportunities for an expanded portfolio of crops&#13;
which the farmer can cultivate. Additionally, the electricity generated permits local milling&#13;
of basic grains, such as manioc, corn and rice, where previously these grains were&#13;
manually milled at home or processed outside the community at private mills. In short,&#13;
subprojects can build on each other, forging a network of community development&#13;
activities. Similarly, spillovers and spillins, in the form of incremental benefits or costs&#13;
which are unintended yet nonetheless result from the undertaking of the subproject, must&#13;
also be recognized in the economic analysis. Again, the spillovers are both difficult to&#13;
identify and difficult to quantify.&#13;
7.    Finally, the community subprojects foster the creation of social capital. The&#13;
demand-driven imperative of the subprojects requires that communities identify and&#13;
prioritize their most pressing needs. Municipal councils established under the project&#13;
would critically examine subproject proposals to both confirm their feasibility and verify&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 117-                           Annex J&#13;
their compatibility with overall community development objectives. These socially&#13;
sustainable community organizations are an important element of social capital formation.&#13;
Members of the community are responsible for counterpart financing of each subproject,&#13;
either in cash or in-kind. As such, project resources are leveraged to undertake the&#13;
productive subprojects by which the community gains access to market channels.&#13;
Qualitative recognition of these benefits is vital to a full understanding of the economic&#13;
impact of a given subproject. However, as in the case of complementarities, spillovers and&#13;
spillins, social capital is difficult to quantify within the framework of estimation of internal&#13;
economic rates of return.&#13;
Infrastructure and Social Subprojects&#13;
8.    First, infrastructure and social subprojects are analyzed using the least cost, best&#13;
alternative criteria. Several aspects of project design help to ensure that infrastructure and&#13;
social subprojects undertaken represent the least-cost, best alternative. First, the demand-&#13;
driven nature of each subproject permits scarce resources to flow where they are most&#13;
needed, thereby improving allocative efficiency. Community participation, under the&#13;
direction of the Municipal Councils created under the project, ensure that the chosen&#13;
subproject is the best alternative for the local community. Second, the use of standard&#13;
technical designs (projetospadr5es), including cost parameters, for the most common&#13;
types of subprojects ensures that least cost models are adopted and decreases search and&#13;
information costs by providing communities with established patterns of initiating and&#13;
completing a subproject. Third, the contracting procedures prescribed in the Project&#13;
Operational Manual requires competitive bidding on all subprojects; the community&#13;
solicits three bids for the subproject and subsequently chooses the least-cost bid. This&#13;
methodology has been shown to be more cost effective in completing the subproject than&#13;
were the same project undertaken by the public sector (for details and examples, see the&#13;
discussion presented in Annex B).&#13;
Productive Subprojects&#13;
9.    The financial and economic analyses completed for this project utilize expost data&#13;
on past subprojects completed under the reformulated NRDP. Productive subprojects&#13;
are analyzed by calculating the IRR for a sample of productive subprojects completed&#13;
under the previous NRDP. Actual cash flows associated with the productive subprojects&#13;
are captured in the estimation of the financial IRR. Nonfinancial benefits and costs, chief&#13;
among them incremental unskilled labor costs, are incorporated into the estimation of the&#13;
economic IRR. The economic IRR is then refined by shadowing the impact of public&#13;
funds on the overall performance of the productive subproject. Data permitting, the cost&#13;
effectiveness of productive subprojects is indicated by estimating the subproject's benefit-&#13;
cost ratio and investment per job created.&#13;
10.   Generally, the analysis of sample cases indicates that the impact of the NRDP on&#13;
the quality of life and incomes of beneficiary communities has been quite positive. As&#13;
shown in Annex B, productive subprojects comprised a small percentage of NRDP&#13;

investments in Paraiba (23%) and were typically implemented only after the basic&#13;
infrastructure (electncity, water supply, better feeder roads) became available. For this&#13;
reason, many of the surveyed productive subprojects only recently became operational,&#13;
while others will reach maturity over the next several years. Financial and economic&#13;
analyses have been conducted on five fully operational productive subprojects,&#13;
representing some of the most popular types of NRDP investments in Paraiba:&#13;
(a)   the group of electrification-induced irrigation subprojects in Nova&#13;
Floresta, benefiting 169 families in 4 different communities. The provision&#13;
of electricity has improved the well-being of these communities and&#13;
increased sales and incomes of local businesses and agro-industries. It also&#13;
led to complementary investments, financed through a special credit&#13;
program of Banco do Nordeste, to produce maracujd, a high-value fruit of&#13;
which there are currently 18 ha irrigated with the use of electric pumps.&#13;
For simplicity, the analysis has considered as subproject benefits only&#13;
maracujd production, while taking into account the cost of additional,&#13;
credit-based investments in irrigation infrastructure and equipment. This&#13;
subproject exemplifies the complementarity discussed earlier; a relatively&#13;
low-cost NRDP infrastructure subproject (about US$140 per person) was&#13;
fully exploited by beneficiaries, with the support of their municipalities and&#13;
local financing agencies, to increase family incomes and living standards;&#13;
(b)   a forage grinder subproject, typical of a popular, extremely low-cost&#13;
NRDP investment which requires equally low operating costs and can&#13;
induce substantial benefits for the recipient communities;&#13;
(c)   a cereals processing subproject, benefiting 130 families, which permitted&#13;
the community of Meia Pataca to mechanize tasks formerly done manually&#13;
(e.g., bean hulling) and carry out the value-added activity of corn milling&#13;
locally;&#13;
(d)   a group of productive irrigation subprojects in Araca and Barragem da&#13;
Farinha, benefiting 44 families, where 48 additional hectares were brought&#13;
under cultivation and sown to an expanded variety of produce; and&#13;
(e)   a small ruminants subproject in Mazagio, benefiting 20 families, which&#13;
boosts milk consumption for both beneficiary families and the community-&#13;
at-large. Additionally, this subproject fosters a virtuous circle of&#13;
community investment in that each beneficiary family donates two female&#13;
goats from its first production so that other such subprojects can be&#13;
started. In total, the twenty beneficiary families for the subproject analyzed&#13;
donated 40 goats to their community as capital investment in subsequent&#13;
subprojects.&#13;
11.   Productive subprojects were evaluated using data collected by a late 1996&#13;
BankWFAO mission and by the Technical Unit in Paraiba. Detailed cost and revenue data&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

were obtained on each productive subproject. Where either benefits or costs were&#13;
nonmonetary in nature, economic costs or benefits were assigned in order to calculate the&#13;
economic IRR. Conversion fictors were also used to transform financial prices to&#13;
economic prices where necessary. The principal nornonetary cost in the majority of&#13;
productive subprojects was unskilled labor; it was priced at the prevailing minimum wage&#13;
and subject to a conversion factor of 0.7 (See Table 1 for the conversion factors applied in&#13;
the analysis). Nonmonetary benefits flowing from the productive subproject (e.g., goats&#13;
milk, legumes, corn for family consumption, increased efficiency in bean processing) were&#13;
valued at the prevailing market price for that good or service. No conversion factors were&#13;
assigned to subproject benefits, since in most cases small quantities were produced and&#13;
they were traded locally. Benefits, costs and prices are assumed to be constant over the&#13;
10-year project horizon.' Estimates of annual benefits, costs, and net incremental benefits&#13;
were then obtained and used to calculate both financial and economic IRRs. Given the&#13;
sampling nature of the exercise and the variations that exist among subprojects in terms&#13;
both of costs and performance, these results should be taken as illustrative only.&#13;

12.   Financial and economic analyses were conducted on a sample of productive&#13;
subprojects in Paraiba (see Annex B for descriptions of productive subprojects): (a)&#13;
electricity-induced irrigation, (b) forage grinder, (c) cereals processing, (d) productive&#13;
irrigation, and (e) small ruminants production. Collectively, these productive subprojects&#13;
accounted for slightly less than 10 percent of all approved community subprojects in&#13;
Paraiba under the reformulated NRDP. Table 2 gives the financial RRs for these&#13;
productive subprojects. Financial IRRs for all subprojects evaluated were satisfactory.&#13;
Forage grinders and productive irrigation both registered financial IRRs in excess of 50&#13;
percent, largely a result of low investment costs for the former and high net benefit&#13;
streams for the latter. For electrification-induced irrigation, the financial IRR was 42&#13;
percent. Small runminants development and cereals processing showed a modest financial&#13;
IRR of 12 percent and 15 percent, respectively.&#13;
For the smail ruminant development subproject, data revealed that projected benefits rose steadily over&#13;
the 10-year horizon.&#13;

13.  In the economic analysis, domestic prices were transformed to border prices&#13;
(where conversion factors were available) and the financial analysis was extended to&#13;
include nonmonetary benefits and costs. Economic IRRs for the sample of productive&#13;
subprojects are reported in Table 3. Given the large nonmonetary impact for small&#13;
ruminants production and cereals processing (e.g., increased milk consumption, donation&#13;
of goats for other similar subprojects, improved efficiency in cereals processing, unskldled&#13;
labor savings), the economic IRR for these productive subprojects was much higher than&#13;
the financial IRR (38 percent and &gt;50 percent, respectively). Forage grinders, productive&#13;
irrigation and electricity-induced irrigation subprojects exhibited economic IRRs in excess&#13;
of 50 percent.&#13;

14.   To determine the sensitivity of the economic IRRs to the distortionary effects of&#13;
publicly-funded grants and the costs associated with raising these funds (i.e., taxation), an&#13;
additional analysis was carried out using a shadow price of public funds. Although lower&#13;
than the "base" economic IRR estimates, the resulting "shadowed" economic IRRs remain&#13;
significantly positive, with the forage grinder subproject continuing to exhibit an economic&#13;
IRR in excess of 50 percent (Table 4). Productive irrigation yields a shadowed economic&#13;
IRR of 30 percent, while electricity-induced irrigation, cereals processing and small&#13;
runinants production and show shadowed economic IRRs of 46 percent, 40 percent and&#13;
20 percent, respectively.&#13;

15.   Unexpected variations in benefit and cost streams can substantially effect the above&#13;
mentioned financial and economic rates of return. Sensitivity analysis attempts to&#13;
capture these unexpected variations. Table 5 reports the financial and economic IRRs&#13;
under the conditions of (i) a 10 percent decrease in benefits and (ii) a 10 percent increase&#13;
in costs. The estimates obtained from the sensitivity analysis can be interpreted as a lower&#13;
bound on the financial and economic IRRs for each type of productive subproject&#13;
examined. For both small ruminants production and cereals processing, variation in&#13;
benefits and costs decreased financial IRRs to 9 percent and 3 percent, respectively, while&#13;
productive irrigation and forage grinders maintained an financial IRR in excess of 50&#13;
percent. Economic IRRs for the five types of productive subprojects ranged from 27&#13;
percent (small ruminants production) to greater than 50 percent (cereals processing,&#13;
forage grinders and electricity-induced irrigation). The shadowing effect of public funds&#13;
reduced the range of economic IRRs to 13 percent (small ruminants production) and&#13;
greater than 50 percent (forage grinders).&#13;

16.   Cost effectiveness is examined by estimation of benefit-cost ratios and investment&#13;
per job created for each productive subproject (Table 6). These ratios are calculated by&#13;
deriving the NPV of both benefit and cost streams, utilizing a discount rate of 10 percent.&#13;
The ratios reflect economic (i.e., monetary and nonmonetary) costs and benefits. Benefit-&#13;
cost ratios for these productive subprojects range from 1.7 (productive irrigation) to&#13;
greater than 5.0 (forage grinders). Including the marginal cost of public funds decreased&#13;
these ratios across all productive subprojects, but ratios remained in the range of 1.3&#13;
(small ruminants and productive irrigation) to greater than 5 (forage grinder). Investment&#13;
per job created was highest for cereals processing subprojects (US$5,819); for productive&#13;
irrigation and small nminants production, investment per'job created was US$1,921 and&#13;
US$1,370, respectively.&#13;
17.   It is envisioned that those subprojects eventually undertaken will possess the&#13;
capacity for long-term sustainability through cost recovery. Whereas initial subproject&#13;
financing will provide the outlays required for start-up, subsequent net revenues from the&#13;
subproject should be sufficient to meet replacement costs of the original capital&#13;
investment. The sustainability of the productive subprojects was evaluated by examining&#13;
(i) cost recovery measures undertaken by each subproject and (ii) the replacement period&#13;

for initial capital equipment. In some cases, user fees are assessed in order to cover 0 &amp;&#13;
M expenses incurred under the subproject and contribute toward the eventual replacement&#13;
of capital equipment. For example, cereals processing subprojects assess a user fee&#13;
(conga) as a percentage of cereals processed by the subproject; these fees also vary,&#13;
depending on whether or not the user is a member of the project group. In the case of the&#13;
forage grinder (forrageira), cost recovery through user fees by the beneficiary association&#13;
is shown to be sufficient for operation and maintenance, including replacement of worn-&#13;
out equipment. As for small ruminants production, productive irrigation and electricity-&#13;
induced irrigation, cost recovery takes the form of subproject revenues (e.g., goat milk&#13;
and meat, marketable produce). For all subprojects evaluated, cost recovery was&#13;
sufficient to cover 0 &amp; M expenses and contribute to eventual replacement of capital&#13;
equipment. Table 7 details cost recovery measures and replacement period for selected&#13;
subprojects in Paraiba.&#13;

Fiscal Impact&#13;
18.   The project will cost an average of US$16 million per year over the five year&#13;
project horizon. For FY 1996, capital expenditures of US$1,034 million were realized by&#13;
the state of Paraiba, an increase of 19 percent from FY 1995. Therefore, annual project&#13;
costs represent 1.5 percent of 1996 capital expenditures. The primary fiscal impact of the&#13;
project will derive from two sources: (a) cost savings and (b) revenue generation.&#13;
Experience has shown that local communities can undertake and complete these small-&#13;
scale subprojects at a lower total cost that is possible through the public sector. For&#13;
example, the rural electrification network installed by the NRDP in 1995 alone was&#13;
equivalent to that which was developed through other programs by the previous State&#13;
Govenment over a four year period. In another example, NRDP water supply&#13;
subprojects have mmniized the need for water delivery via tanker trucks (carropipa);&#13;
cost savings for all states under the reformulated NRDP due to these water subprojects&#13;
range from US$7 million in a year of normal precipitation to US$15 million in a drought&#13;
year. Surveys in many states indicate that infiastructure projects are, on average, about 30&#13;
percent less expensive when implemented by the communities (i.e., demand-driven) than&#13;
by government agencies or contractors. Thus, by decentralizing toward the community&#13;
level, the state can achieve costs reductions which in turn will allow reallocation of scarce&#13;
public finance to other pressing needs.&#13;
19.   The demand-driven nature of the project precludes the ex ante estimation of fiscal&#13;
revenues; however, experiences accumulated under the reformulated NRDP can shed light&#13;
on any potential changes in public sector fiscal balances which may result from the project.&#13;
Expanded commodity production under the majority of the productive subprojects&#13;
evaluated can potentially generate additional public revenues through taxation. However,&#13;
the combination of informal market transactions, own consumption of subproject benefits&#13;
and tax exemptions will limit public revenue generation from these subprojects. The State&#13;
of Paraiba exempts the following agricultural items from value-added taxation (ICMS)&#13;
when marketed within the State: corn (for animal consumption), fish, agricultural inputs&#13;
and goat products. Interstate and state tax exemptions apply to the following items:&#13;
manioc, raw sugar, most fresh fruits and vegetables. This list would encompass the vast&#13;
majority of marketable produce from productive subprojects. In all cases, tax collection&#13;
depends on the extension of a notafiscal which formalizes the sale before the public&#13;
authorities. However, rural transactions are largely informal in nature, which in turn&#13;
precludes significant public sector revenue generation from community subprojects.&#13;

K PROJECT SUPERVISION&#13;
1.    The principal role of project supervision is to ensure that project implementation&#13;
follows the guidelines set forth in the Loan Agreement and detailed in the Operational&#13;
Manual. At the operational level, project supervision arrangements are designed to&#13;
provide essential informaton on the general performance of the project and the feedback&#13;
necessary for managerial decision-maling. Information collected regularly from the field&#13;
during project implementation will provide the Project Coordinating Unit (PCU) with the&#13;
tools necessary to: (a) identify and correct departures from project guidelines; (b)&#13;
reinforce targeting mechanisms; (c) modify technical assistance strategies; and (d) identify&#13;
training needs.&#13;
2.    Supervision Responsibilities. In line with the decentralized implementation of&#13;
the project, the responsibilities for project supervision at the state and local levels will&#13;
correspond to the PCU and the project Municipal Councils, respectively:&#13;
(a)   at the state level: the PCU will monitor global trends across all project&#13;
municipalities, oversee the functioning and activities of project Municipal&#13;
Councils, and supervise the portfolio of subprojects under the PAC&#13;
subprogram; and&#13;
(b)   at the local level: the project Municipal Councils will monitor the&#13;
performance of the subproject portfolio under the FUMAC and FUMAC-P&#13;
subprograms.&#13;
3.    At the state level, the PCU's responsibilities include: (a) monitor the quality of&#13;
global project implementation and administration; (b) assess community participation in&#13;
the identification, preparation and execution of PAC subprojects, as well as the quality of&#13;
technical assistance provided to beneficiary communities in PAC; (c) collect and verify&#13;
pertinent information on the project and subprojects for the MIS; and (d) review the&#13;
activities of the FUMAC and FUMAC-P Municipal Councils.&#13;
4.    Supervision of the project Municipal Councils by the PCU will focus on the&#13;
following points: (a) the composition of the Councils to ensure they meet the required&#13;
80%/ beneficiary representation; (b) the frequency and openness of the Councils' meetings;&#13;
(c) the criteria applied to screen, prioritize and approve subproject proposals and the&#13;
effectiveness of targeting of project benefits to the poorest communities; and (d) the&#13;
capacity of the Councils to provide technical assistance to the beneficiary communities. In&#13;
addition to these points, supervision of the FUMAC-P Councils will focus on whether the&#13;
administrative and financial arrangements made by these Councils are effective in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 125 -                         Annex K&#13;
managing and releasing subproject funds to the community associations as well as&#13;
progress in the implementation of POAs agreed for each FUMAC-P Council.&#13;
5.    At the local level, the Municipal Councils, with support from the PCU, will carry&#13;
out the following supervision tasks in their respective municipalities: (a) verification of&#13;
the status and quality of subproject implementation; (b) assessment of community&#13;
participation in the identification, preparation and execution of subprojects; (c) evaluation&#13;
of the extent to which communities are organized to effectively undertake the operation&#13;
and maintenance of the investments, following, in the case of productive subprojects, the&#13;
appropriate regulamentos de uso; (d) identification of technical assistance and training&#13;
needs; and (e) assessment of effectiveness of targeting of project benefits and identification&#13;
of potential beneficiary communities not yet participating in the project. In addition to&#13;
these tasks, FUMAC-P Councils witl follow-up on compliance by beneficiary associations&#13;
with subproject agreements signed with them.&#13;
6.    To fulfill their supervision responsibilities, given the number of subprojects in the&#13;
field and the amount of information to collect, both the PCU and the project Municipal&#13;
Councils may delegate some supervision tasks to selected NGOs and participating public&#13;
agencies (e.g., EMATER), according to specific terms of reference developed for this&#13;
purpose. This assistance would be especially useful for evaluating the status of&#13;
community organization and mobilization. In addition, to facilitate the supervision of&#13;
individual subprojects under implementation, the PCU and the Municipal Councils would&#13;
liaise with the Subproject Supervision and Control Committees (Annex D) --community&#13;
miembers designated to supervise each subproject and control the status and quality of&#13;
subproject implementation. Whether carried out by the PCU, Municipal Councils or a&#13;
partner organization, subprojects would receive two supervision visits in their first year of&#13;
implementation and, in the case of productive subprojects and water supply subprojects, at&#13;
least one visit per year thereafter.&#13;
7.    Supervision Reporting. Information collected during supervision, including&#13;
indicators of subproject implementation performance and the identification of the principal&#13;
bottlenecks or problems, will be incorporated into the subproject standard data sheets (see&#13;
Annex H) and included in the MIS, maintained by the PCU. To aid the overall&#13;
information collection process between the state and local levels, the project Municipal&#13;
Councils will report regularly to the PCU on the implementation of the subprojects in their&#13;
respective municipalities. The contents and frequency of these reports would be&#13;
determined by the PCU and included in the Operational Manual. Based on the project and&#13;
subproject information collected at the state and local levels, the PCU will prepare and&#13;
submit to the Bank mid-year and annual reports on the overall physical and financial status&#13;
of project implementation and performance. In addition, the PCU will present the Annual&#13;
Operating Plan (POA) and corresponding budget for each subsequent fiscal year of&#13;
implementation to the Bank for its review and comment.&#13;
8.    World Bank Supervision. In keeping with the decentralized implementation of&#13;
the project, and based on the experience under the reformulated NRDP, the Bank will&#13;
continue its decentralized supervision of the project. The Bank will carry out at least two&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-126-                            Annex K&#13;
regular supervision missions per year from its field office in Recife. Regular supervision&#13;
will entail: (a) a discussion of project implementation problems identified by the PCU&#13;
and/or Municipal Councils; (b) field visits to a random sample of community subprojects;&#13;
and (c) a review of the performance of all project components, and particularly an&#13;
assessment of the FUMAC-P pilot subprogram, to address problems and make appropriate&#13;
recommendations. In addition, based on frequent communication with the PCU, the&#13;
Recife Office will conduct short supervision missions to address problems which require&#13;
prompt action. Also, in view of the diversity of community subprojects, consultants of&#13;
different expertise would be contracted to provide occasional input and advice to Bank&#13;
missions. Two full supervision reports will be issued annually, as well as Back-to-Office&#13;
reports for each short supervision mission. It is estimated that about 35 staff-weeks will&#13;
be required for project supervision, or about seven staff-weeks annually during the five&#13;
years of project implementation.&#13;
9.    The schedule of project supervision is as follows:&#13;
(a)   by July 31 and January 31 of each year, presentation of mid-year and&#13;
annual reports from PCU to the Bank;&#13;
(b)   by February and September of each year, full Bank supervision missions&#13;
completed; and&#13;
(c)   by October 30 of each year, presentation of the POA for the subsequent&#13;
year to the Bank for review and comment by November 15.&#13;

            The Rural Poverty Alleviation Project,
            based on the Northeast Rural Poverty Alleviation Program,
            assists the state government of Paraiba in alleviating rural
            poverty by a) providing basic social and economic
            infrastructure, and employment and income-generating
            opportunities; b) decentralizing resource allocation and
            decisionmaking; c) leveraging resources mobilized at the
            community level; and d) deepening the creation of social
            capital. The project has three components: 1) community
            subprojects, which support small-scale investments selected
            and subsequently operated and maintained by beneficiaries;
            2) institutional development, which provides all
            implementing entities and communities with technical
            assistance and training to increase capacity and improve
            project implementation; and 3) project administration,
            supervision, monitoring, and evaluation, which finances
            project coordination and activities to provide feedback on
            project performance and impact.
