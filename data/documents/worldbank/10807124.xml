&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   A.    Major Impedimentsto the Reformsof Inter-GovernmentFiscal Relations&#13;
&#13;
1.      Weak Fiscal and StructuralAdjustmentReforms at the Sub-NationalLevel&#13;
TheRussian Federationhas undergonesignificantreformsin its system of inter-&#13;
governmentalfiscal relations sincethe beginningof the transition.The Budget Code,&#13;
approvedby the Duma in 1998,andPart I of the Tax Code', whichwent into effectin&#13;
January1999 are examplesof major Governmenteffortsto reformfiscal management&#13;
andbudgeting at the sub-nationallevel,as well as the existing systemof revenue andtax&#13;
assignments.Whilethe pace and depthof reformshad acceleratedin the first half of&#13;
1998,the Augustcrisis broughtthese governmenteffortsto anabrupt halt. However,in&#13;
1999,the Government's attempts to reforminter-governmentalfiscal relationshave&#13;
receiveda new, strong impetus. An Inter-MinisterialWorkingGroup (IMWG)for Inter-&#13;
GovernmentalFiscal Reformhas been formedand meets regularly,a GovernmentFiscal&#13;
Concept Paperhas been approved andhas been adheredto, and a working dialoguewith&#13;
the regionson keyissues of inter-governmentalreformhas been resumed. Yet,Russia's&#13;
fiscal and structuraladjustmentreformsat the sub-nationallevel have been alarmingly&#13;
slow. In many instancesthe progressof federalfiscal reformshas been reversed by the&#13;
increasedallocationof subsidiesto the housing sector andenterprisesfrom the regional&#13;
and municipalbudgets.From small surplusesin the early 1990s,mostregionalbudgets&#13;
have slipped into deficits.Sub-nationalgovernmentinterest paymentsdue in 1998&#13;
amountedto about 0.74 percent of GDP, and muchof thiswas never paid. The August&#13;
17, 1998ruble devaluationand the subsequenteconomiccrisistriggereda chain of&#13;
defaults by the regionson locallytraded debt. As aresult, a clearimbalancehas&#13;
developedbetween fiscal adjustmenteffortsat the federaland sub-nationallevels, posing&#13;
a seriousthreat to Russia's macroeconomicstabilityand impairingnational economic&#13;
growth.At present,the Government's effortsto accelerate fiscal and structuralreforms at&#13;
the sub-nationallevelare being hamperedby three issues:&#13;
&#13;
* Deficient Legal Framework*The current inter-governmentallegal frameworkdoes&#13;
    not provide incentivesthroughoutthe multi-tieredfiscal systemfor effectivetax&#13;
    collection,efficient allocationof public resources,and financiallyresponsible&#13;
    borrowing. Lack of clarity in expenditureassignmentsandthe extensiveuse of&#13;
    unfinded expendituremandatesfromupper-level governmentspromoteinefficient&#13;
    expenditurepatterns and fiscallyirresponsiblebehavior. In addition,the overall legal&#13;
    frameworkgoverningthe systemof inter-governmentalfiscal relationsis riddledwith&#13;
    inconsistenciesand contradictions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
l PartIIof theTaxCodeisstillunderdiscussion.&#13;
&#13;
                                             1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
* Poor Compliance.Althoughoverthe past six yearsmany laws have been passed on&#13;
    budgetingand financial management,revenue sharing,transfers,and assignment of&#13;
    functionalresponsibilities,there has been considerablevariationin the degree of&#13;
    compliancewiththese laws by the regions.Enforcementof these laws remains weak.&#13;
    In somecases,the laws have been little more than proclamations,with essentiallyno&#13;
    implementation.&#13;
&#13;
* Weak InstitutionalCapacity The Governmentfaces severe capacity constraintsin&#13;
   the designand implementationof inter-governmentalfiscal reforms,as well as in&#13;
   monitoringthe complianceof the regionswith federalregulations.The institutional&#13;
    capacityof the regionsto implementfiscal andbudgetary reformsis of evenmore&#13;
    concern, as the federalreform agenda growsevermore complex.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
               B. GORAgenda for Inter-GovernmentalFiscal Reform&#13;
&#13;
2.    The GORrecognizesthat these issues mustbe addressedas part of its medium-term&#13;
economicagenda. The GOR's medium-termeconomicstrategy includes actionsto&#13;
eliminateunfundedmandatesfromthe federalto sub-nationalgovernments,revise the&#13;
formulafor allocatingfederalequalizationtransfersto the regions, and develop a&#13;
programto rationalizeexpenditureandtax assignmentswith the objectives of&#13;
establishinga more stable and transparentsystemof inter-governmentalfinance and&#13;
providingapotential revenue base at each level of governmentcommensuratewith its&#13;
respectiveresponsibilities.&#13;
&#13;
3.    In orderto implementits reform agendain the area of inter-governmentalfiscal&#13;
relations,the GOR requestedBank financingto supportthe following Government&#13;
efforts:&#13;
&#13;
·  Promotelegal reform of inter-governmentalfiscal relations,includingfiscal&#13;
   managementand budgeting,debt management,revenue andtax assignments,&#13;
   assignmentof expenditures,and inter-governmentalfiscal transfers;&#13;
&#13;
* Builda powerfulfiscal incentivemechanismto improveregional compliancewith&#13;
   federalrules andregulations.Aspart of this effort,the Project will support further&#13;
   Bankeffortsto promote fiscal and structuralreforms inthe regions;&#13;
&#13;
* Improveregionalinstitutionalcapacityto design,implementand monitor fiscal&#13;
   reforms. The Governmentbelievesthe Bankcan provide valuabletechnical supportto&#13;
   the Fiscal MonitoringDivisionof the Ministryof Finance (FMD), whichwould focus&#13;
   on monitoringregional compliancewith Federal legislationand provide analytical&#13;
   supportand policy adviceon inter-governmentalfiscal issuesto the Inter-Ministerial&#13;
   WorkingGroupfor FiscalReform. In addition,the Governmentrequested the Bank's&#13;
   assistance in designingand implementingcomplexbudgetary and structuralreforms&#13;
   at the regional levelrequired by the Governmentreform program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                            2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                              C. RationaleforBank Involvement&#13;
&#13;
4.    The proposedRegionalFiscal TechnicalAssistanceProject is fully consistentwith&#13;
the objectivesof the Russia CountryAssistanceStrategy(CAS)due to be presentedto the&#13;
Board in conjunctionwith this operation,and withoperational standardsforproject&#13;
quality inthat it:&#13;
&#13;
* respondsto the Government's request for assistance infacilitating fiscal adjustmentat&#13;

&#13;
* contributesto the structuralreformprogram by identifyingthe prioritiesof public&#13;
    sector spendingand expenditureprogramsfor alternativeprovisionby the private&#13;
    sector;&#13;
&#13;
* promotesmore equitableand efficientpublic spendingthrough improvementsin the&#13;
    legalframeworkof inter-governmentalfiscal relations;&#13;
&#13;
* buildsinstitutionalcapacity for fiscal and economicmanagementat the federal and&#13;
    sub-nationallevels, whichis a key structuralreform priority.&#13;

6.     The Bankbrings experiencewith sub-nationalfiscal management,reformof inter-&#13;
governmentalfiscal relations,andreform of housing and communalservices in other&#13;
transitionaland middle-incomecountries. Theproposed approach underthe project&#13;
would draw on Bankexperienceaccumulatedfrompreviousoperations (both adjustment&#13;
andinvestmentprojects),includingthose developedfor other economiesin transition.&#13;
Oneimportantlesson from other Bankprojects inRussia (e.g.,EHDP,Urban Transport,&#13;
Housing,and St. PetersburgCenter City RehabilitationProject)is that reform&#13;
developmentsat the sub-nationallevel needto be closelymonitored.Strengtheningthe&#13;
governmentmonitoringcapacity in thisrespect, is criticalto successfulproject&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
7.     Technicalassistanceloans (TALs)are traditionallyamongthe weakestperformers&#13;
in the Bank's portfolio. Whilethe causesof poorly performingBank TALs are a source&#13;
of continuingdebate, OED's findingssuggestthat governanceproblems andweak&#13;
managementhave been two main reasonsfor their poor past performance.The Bank's&#13;
experiencewith TALs in Russia underscoresthe importanceof these lessons. In this&#13;
regard,workable governancestructuresand strongmanagementhave been the key&#13;
considerationsin selecting aproject implementationagency. The Foundationfor&#13;
EnterpriseRestructuringhas been selected as the PIU for the RFTAP. The FER has&#13;
developeda strong projectadministrationcapacity,proven by an exemplarydisbursement&#13;
record andhigh qualityof outputs.Its experience,however,highlights the need to settle&#13;
the project governancearrangementsandinitiateprocurementas early as possible in&#13;
orderto avoid delays in mobilizationof technicalassistance,which, inthe case of the&#13;
RFTAP,couldjeopardize the governmentprogramof inter-governmentalreform.&#13;
&#13;
8.     Fiscal adjustmentand sectoralperformanceindicators,in particularthose relatedto&#13;
the regional structuralreform of the keysectors such as housing andtransport, will be&#13;
developedbasedon the experienceof variousinvestmentprojects such as the EHDP.&#13;
Reformprogramsrecently developedby the IBRD underPublic ResourceManagement&#13;
Loans inKazakhstan, Kyrgystan,and otherFSU states will be also taken into account.&#13;
Project preparationwill benefitfrom smallerpieces of TA to regional governmentsin&#13;

&#13;
                                    A. Project Objectives&#13;
&#13;
9.    The Regional Fiscal Technical Assistance Project (RFTAP)pursues the following&#13;
objectives:&#13;
&#13;
    improve the legal framework for sub-national public finance and inter-governmental&#13;
    fiscal relations:&#13;
    establish a mechanism for improving compliance with federal laws and regulations in&#13;
    the area of fiscal management and promote fiscally responsible behavior at the sub-&#13;
    national level through appropriate economic incentives;&#13;
    strengthen the Government's capacity to monitor sub-national fiscal performance and&#13;
    reform efforts;&#13;
    strengthen the institutional capacity of sub-national governments to carry out fiscal&#13;
    and structural reforms.&#13;
&#13;
10.   Key policy and institutional reforms arc the focus of the Project. The Project&#13;
would: (i) promote the establishment of a stable, fair and predictable system of inter-&#13;
governmental fiscal relations which would provide sub-national governments with&#13;
appropriate incentives to undertake fiscal reforms; (ii) promote the use of modern&#13;
accounting and budgeting practices which will give a fair and representative view of the&#13;
financial position of sub-national governments; (iii) support the development of&#13;
individual regional reform programs to reduce deficit spending and improve the&#13;
efficiency of budget expenditures at the sub-national level; and (iv) improve the overall&#13;
financial stability and creditworthiness of participating sub-national governments.&#13;
&#13;
                                    B. Project Description&#13;
&#13;
I I.  The Project will finance four components: (i) Strengthening Federal and Regional&#13;
Fiscal Legislation; (ii) Strengthening Federal Monitoring Capacity: Fiscal Monitoring&#13;
Division and the PIU for the RFTAP; (iii) Assistance to Sub-National Governments in&#13;
Accounting and Budgeting; and (iv) Sectoral Public Expenditure Reviews.&#13;
&#13;
12.   Strengthening FederaI and Regional Fiscal Legislation (US$2.4 million).&#13;
Development and implementation of the Government's fiscal reform will require&#13;
substantial efforts in improving the current legal framework for inter-governmental&#13;
relations. Financing would be provided for local consultants and, as necessary,&#13;
international experts to assist in the completion of relevant tasks. The legal and policy&#13;
research efforts will be focused on high-priority themes such as inventory of the current&#13;
assignment of revenue and expenditures responsibilitiesbetween the federal, regional and&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
local governments;designof formula-basedequalizationtransfersfor the regions;federal&#13;
regulationsfor monitoringsub-nationalfiscal performance;andanalysis of the&#13;
consistencyand compatibilityof existing legislationon sub-nationalpublic financeand&#13;
inter-governmentalfiscal relations.It is envisagedthat the work underthe component&#13;
will be closely coordinatedwith the LegalReform Project.In addition,the component&#13;
will providefor additionalflexibilityto respondto requestsfrom seniorofficialson&#13;
developmentsinthe legalenvironmentinthe formof quick-responselegal/policynotes.&#13;
&#13;
13. StrengtheningFederalMonitoringCapacity:Fiscal MonitoringDivision and&#13;
the PIU for the RFTAP (US$14.8million).The componentwould financethe provision&#13;
of technicalassistancerelatingto the strengtheningof institutionalcapacityfor the&#13;
design,implementationand monitoringof the fiscal and structuralreforms and&#13;
performanceat the sub-nationallevel,throughthe financingof goodsand services.These&#13;
expenditureswould include: (i) computerand informationtechnologyneeded for the&#13;
statisticalanalysisof regionaldata; (ii)the creation of a library and on-line databaseson&#13;
regionalfiscal practicesand the current legislation;(iii) developmentand dissemination&#13;
of Principles(Code)of Good Practicefor regionalfinancialmanagementas an extra legal&#13;
standard; (iv)designof financial disclosurerequirementsfor sub-nationaland municipal&#13;
borrowers; (v) ongoingmonitoringof fiscal and structuralreforms andperformanceat the&#13;
sub-nationallevel,as well as compliancewith federallaws and regulations;(vi)&#13;
analyticalsupport andpolicy adviceon key issuesof inter-governmentalfiscal reform&#13;
and sub-nationalpublic finance;(vii) training,study tours for FMD staff andfor&#13;
governmentstaff(includingregionalpolicy-makers)participating inthe project activities&#13;
to developmodem analytical skillsrequiredfor the implementationof fiscal reforms;&#13;
(viii) office furnishing,administrativeand computersupportto the staffof the FMD and&#13;
consultantsworking on other projectcomponents.&#13;
&#13;
14. The componentincludes a budget for conferencesand seminarson inter-&#13;
governmentalissuesto promote exchangesof experts anddisseminategood fiscal&#13;
managementpractices inthe Russian regions.&#13;
&#13;
15. The Project's incrementaloperatingcosts wouldbe financed100% fromthe&#13;
proceedsof the Bankloan. The MOF and regionalgovernmentswouldprovide in-kind&#13;
contributionstowardthe FMD's costs (e.g., rent,utilities, seniorproject management,&#13;
andregional supportteams). Upon expirationof the Bankloan, the core activitiesof the&#13;
FMD will be fully fundedfromthe Government's budget.&#13;
&#13;
16. Assistanceto Sub-NationalGovernmentsin Accounting andBudgeting&#13;
(US$10.1million).Budgeting andfiscal managementat the sub-nationallevelin the&#13;
Russian Federation,with somepossibleregionalexceptions,has failedto keeppace with&#13;
reformsat the federallevel.The budget formulationprocess has notevolved fromthe&#13;
previousregime's practices. There is no modem treasuryfunction for budget execution,&#13;
ex-postaudit is spotty,and there is no evaluationof budgetpolicies. Anotherissue of&#13;
significantimportance is the lack of transparencyin the regionalaccountingrecords&#13;
whichimpairs the capacity of lendersandthe federalgovernmentto make timely and&#13;
adequateassessmentsof regionalcreditworthiness.The Governmenthas initiated several&#13;
major effortsto improve the qualityof financialreporting andbudget managementin the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
regions.However,these effortshave not yet spelled outin sufficientdetail the changes&#13;
needed in financialmanagement,accountingandreporting at the regionallevel.&#13;
&#13;
17. Tothis end, the componentwill financethe provisionof technical assistanceto the&#13;
ParticipatingRegions,in support of regionalinstitutionaldevelopmentprograms,&#13;
consistingof: (i) diagnosticreviews anddevelopmentof reformplans in the area of&#13;
budgetingand fiscal management;(ii) financial planning,treasury andcash management;&#13;
(iii) budgetary accounting,reporting andaudit; (iv)expenditureandpublic sector&#13;
restructuring;(v) debt managementsystems;(vi)regionalbudget procurementsystem;&#13;
(vii) regionalfiscal managementguidelines,bestpractice standards,andregionaland&#13;
localpublic financemanual; (viii) computerequipmentanddesign of softwareprograms;&#13;
and (ix)trainingof local staffneeded for a successfulinstallationandsubsequent&#13;
applicationof integratedfinancial managementsystems inthe selectedregions.&#13;
&#13;
18. SectoralPublic ExpenditureReviews (US$2.4million). Fiscal adjustmentat the&#13;
sub-nationallevelis linkedto the successof regionalstructuralreforms. Currentpatterns&#13;
of regionalbudget expenditures-including unsustainablesubsidization-indicate that&#13;
structuralreformsin the regionshave been slower than anticipated.The componentwill&#13;
assistparticipatingregionswith the designof expenditurereform plansby financinga&#13;
number of public expenditurereviews.Thesewill primarilyfocus on the sectorswhich&#13;
have been the largest recipientsof subsidiesfromconsolidatedregionalbudgets such as&#13;
housing and utilities, agriculture,public transportation,educationand health.The reviews&#13;
are expectedto result inprioritizationof budgetexpendituresinto key functional sectors,&#13;
identificationof expenditureprogramsandprojects withlowerpriority, introductionof&#13;
appropriatepricing policiesto provide for costrecovery, as well as identificationof&#13;
sectoralexpenditureprogramsfor alternativeprovisionby the privatesector. The&#13;
componentis expectedto generate substantialsavings for regionalbudgetsin the form of&#13;
reducedsubsidies to the sectoralprogramswithlow rates of return or/and of low public&#13;
priority.&#13;

                            C. Summaryof ProjectAnalysis&#13;
&#13;
19. Economic. Althoughthe Project does not lend itself to standardcost-benefit&#13;
analysis,it should improvethe efficiency of public expendituremanagementthrough&#13;
increasedtransparencyin financial reporting,increasedefficiencyin resource allocation&#13;
and improvedtargetingof subsidies andbenefits at the sub-nationallevel.&#13;
&#13;
20.    Financial.It has been discussed andagreed with the Governmentthat technical&#13;
assistanceto the regions beprovided out of the loan on a grantbasis. No on-lendingto&#13;
the regionsis envisaged.&#13;
&#13;
21. Fiscal impact The Project is expectedto have a significantfiscal impactby&#13;
promotingefficiency in public expenditurethrough increasedtransparencyin budget&#13;
planning andreporting. The Project would also enableregionsto reduce budget deficits,&#13;
reduce subsidies for housing and municipalservices, andimprove targetingof social&#13;
assistancebenefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22.   Technical.It is expectedthat thetechnical assistanceprogramwill require the&#13;
servicesof bothinternational andlocal consultantsin orderto ensureaccess to&#13;
internationalbestpractice, while at the same timeensuringtimely access andproper&#13;
interpretationof existing financial data. It is assumedthat relativelylimited investment&#13;
will be requiredto develop or adapt softwareneededto implementnew accountingand&#13;
budgetingprocesses.&#13;
&#13;
23.   Institutional.Executing agencies:The Project will be implementedby the&#13;
Foundationfor EnterpriseRestructuring,whichwill be in charge of procurementand&#13;
disbursementactivities.The FER staffare alreadyexperiencedwith Bank procedures.&#13;
The conceptual guidanceunderthe Project is to be providedby the FMD, which shall&#13;
assist the GOR in designing,implementingand monitoringthe inter-governmentalfiscal&#13;
reforms.The Inter-MinisterialWorkingGroup for FiscalReform will guidethe reforms&#13;
and overseethe FMD's activities.The qualitymonitoringfunction will be carried outby&#13;
the Expert Council.&#13;
&#13;
24.   Social. Someexpenditurereformsand,in particular,movementto costrecovery in&#13;
the area of housing and communalservicesmay adverselyimpact low-incomegroups.&#13;
Considerationwillbe givento improvementof targetingof assistanceto the poorest&#13;
groups.Theproject will incorporatethe lessonsof economicand sectorwork already&#13;
undertakenin this area, includingthe experienceof the SPIL.&#13;
&#13;
25.   Environmentalassessment-For the purposes of environmentalassessment,the&#13;
Project falls into Category C.&#13;
&#13;
                                    D. ProjectBenefits&#13;
&#13;
26.    The principalproject benefitwill bethe improvedlegal frameworkof sub-national&#13;
public financeand inter-governmentalfiscal relationsand structuraladjustment at the&#13;
sub-nationallevel.These would resultfrom intensiveproject effortsto enhancethe&#13;
existinglegalframework of inter-governmentalrelationsandimprove institutional&#13;
capacity of the federalgovernmentand the regionsin fiscal and economicmanagement.&#13;
As a result of the Project, the Governmentis expectedto retainenhancedcapacity in&#13;
governmentinstitutionsfor analytic economicwork and monitoringinthe area of inter-&#13;
governmentalfiscal relations.A principalbenefitof the Project in the longterm will be&#13;
sounder fiscal and economicpolicies of the regions.&#13;
&#13;
                                     E. ProjectRisks&#13;
&#13;
27. There is a risk that the current consensusin favor of inter-governmentalfiscal&#13;
reformmight be lost andthat the program mightthen stall. Thisrisk is partiallymitigated&#13;
by includingrepresentativesof the Dumaandthe FederationCouncil inthe IMWG.The&#13;
reasonthat progresstoward a more stable andtransparentinter-governmentalfiscal&#13;
systemis importantfor the success of this projectis that without consistent andpositive&#13;
incentivesin supportof regionalfiscal reform,technicalassistance mightnot lead to a&#13;
changein behavior. The federaldimensionsof the project,in particular, are designedto&#13;
mitigatethis risk.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28.   Thepossibleweakening of politicalwill to implementfiscal managementreforms&#13;
at the regionallevelposes another risk for the Project. This couldhappen as aresult of&#13;
the improvedtransparencyof regionalbudgetsandaccountingproceduresimposinghard&#13;
budgetaryconstraintson the regionaladministrations,thus making it difficultto resort to&#13;
off-budgetaryfunds or to accrueoff-budgetaryliabilities. Sucha situationcouldtrigger&#13;
politicaloppositiontothe Project at the sub-nationallevel.Maintainingpositive regional&#13;
perceptionsof the benefits of inter-governmentalfiscal reform canmitigatethis risk by&#13;
rewardingthose who undertakeagreedreforms.&#13;

&#13;
32.    All Bank-financedgoods and consultantserviceswould be procured in accordance&#13;
withthe Bank's Guidelines:ProcurementUnder IBRD Loans andIDA Credits (January&#13;
1995,revised Januaryand August 1996,September1997, andJanuary 1999) and&#13;
Guidelines:Selectionand Employmentof Consultantsby World BankBorrowers&#13;
(January1997,revised September 1997andJanuary 1999),respectively.National&#13;
Shopping(NSH) procurementwould require that originalprice quotations andreceipts&#13;
fromsuppliersbekept on file for review/auditpurposesduring supervisionmissions. The&#13;
FER's AdministrativeDepartnent would beresponsiblefor trackingprocurementactions&#13;
andapprovals as well,as periodicallyreportingto the Bank on procurementprogress.&#13;
&#13;
                                          13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Two additionalprocurement staffwill be hiredto work in the PIU, includingone Senior&#13;
ProcurementSpecialist,andone AssociateProcurementSpecialist.Also, staff will be&#13;
trainedthroughperiodictraining workshopsconductedby the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
* GeneralProcurement-The majorityof procurementactions underthe proposed&#13;
    projectwould be for consultantservices.To ensurethat the standard of consultants&#13;
    procuredunderthe Projectwere of sufficientlyhighquality,the FER would submit&#13;
    for the Bank's priorreview terms of referencefor all consultantcontracts.&#13;
    Advertisementswould beplace in DevelopmentBusiness,and expressionsof interest&#13;
    fromfirms sought for all ICB and consultantcontracts.UJNDBpublicationswill be&#13;

    packages not to exceedUS$50,000(US$550,000total). As such, none of the&#13;
    packages would require prior Bankapproval.To minimizethe numberof contracts&#13;
    andreduce the unit costs, computersfor the regionswould be purchasedin packages&#13;
    of aboutUS$700,000each (US$1.5milliontotal). These packageswould be procured&#13;

&#13;
     About the Project:&#13;
&#13;
     The Project seeksto contributeto the reform of Russian sub-nationalgovernmentfinance&#13;
across abroad front,both geographically(six regions)and functionally(all aspectsof sub-&#13;
national fiscal management).It is bothamnbitiousand complex,and involves a significant&#13;
number of separatebut interdependentcomponentsof technicalassistance,whichmust work&#13;
effectivelytogetherif the Project is to achieveits goals efficientlyand on time.&#13;
&#13;
      The Project consists of four major componentsof external TA, each of whichwill be&#13;
procuredas a whole, but consistsof a numberof sub-components.The major componentsare;&#13;
&#13;
      1. StrengtheningFederal Legislationon IntergovernmentalFiscal Relationsand Sub-&#13;
          nationalPublic Finance&#13;
     2. StrengtheningFederal MonitoringCapacityandDevelopmentof Standardsfor&#13;
          RegionalFinanceManagement&#13;
     3. Assistanceto Sub-NationalGovernmentsin Accountingand Budgeting&#13;
     4. SectoralPublicExpenditureReviews.&#13;
&#13;
      It is essentialthat work on each of these componentstakes full accountof (andwhere&#13;
relevant alsocontributesto) workthat is beingdone on the other components.The Project covers&#13;
groundthat also is being or has been examinedby other Russian- or donor-financedwork&#13;
("AssociatedProjects").It is importantthat due accountis taken of this work, andthat it is&#13;
incorporatedwhereappropriateas inputs intothis Project.&#13;
&#13;
      ProjectManagement:Fiscal MonitoringDivision ("FMD")andFoundationfor&#13;
      EnterpriseRestructuring:&#13;
&#13;
      Project implementationwill formallybehandled by the Foundationfor Enterprise&#13;
Restructuring(FER), but day-to-daymanagementwill be providedby the Fiscal Monitoring&#13;
Division(FMD) of the Ministryof Finance,which is intendedto becomethe focal point for&#13;
managementstandardsin Russian regionalfinance,andthe centralrepository for all information&#13;
aboutregional finances.&#13;
&#13;
      FMD will also have an advisoryrole inrecommendinglegaland extra-legalstandardsfor&#13;
all aspectsof regional governmentfinance inRussia, includingadviceto the Inter-Ministerial&#13;
WorkingGroup (IMWG)on improvingall aspectsof budgeting, accounting, andthe preparation&#13;
of financialreportsfor electors/tax-payers,centralgovernment,management,suppliersand&#13;
creditors;and the setting of standardsfor financialmanagementgenerallyin regional&#13;
govermment.FMD will advisethe IMWGon the desiredcontentand structure of legislation and&#13;
regulation,(iricluding"extra-legal" instrumentssuchas a code of Good Practicewith compliance&#13;
encouragedby incentives,as opposed to legalrequirementswherenon-complianceis penalized&#13;
by legal sanctions).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 34&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      Morespecifically, FM:Dwill perform the followingfunctions:&#13;
&#13;
      * developingand specifying the regulatorystandardsfor monitoringregionalfinance;&#13;
      * establishingthe tools for monitoringregionalfinance;&#13;
      * specificationof monitoringneedsfor each of the identified future functions&#13;
      * monitor compliancewithfederalrequirements,for purposes of authorizingfederal&#13;
          Budget Transfers;&#13;
      * developingresearch-and databank.&#13;
&#13;
      The FMD is thereforeresponsible (underIMWG andMinFin authority)for the direction&#13;
and integrationof the variousparts of the Projectwithin the Terms of Reference,andfor using&#13;
its discretionto ensurethat TA resourcesare used as efficientlyas possibleto coverthe areas of&#13;
greatestincrementalneed, includingorganisationof routine exchangeof informationbetween the&#13;
contributorsto the TA, and by running a "steeringcommittee"for the Project.Providers of TA&#13;
will be expectedto contributeto this forum,andto receivedirection from it, within theirterms of&#13;
reference.&#13;
&#13;
      Concept Paper:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      A paper entitled "Conceptsof IntergovernmentalFiscal Reform in the Russian Federation,&#13;
1999- 2001",prepared by the Governmentof the Russian Federationin 1998,definesthe&#13;
objectives,particularlyin respect of intergovernmentalissues. The FMD will beavailableto help&#13;
provide updatesand interpretprioritiesin the implementationof this paper.&#13;
&#13;
      Inventory, Associated Projects:&#13;
&#13;
      An Inventory of AssociatedProjects,covering other TA work on topics similartothose&#13;
underthe Project, willbe provided to prospectivebiddersfor TA work hereunder. (A draft is&#13;
attachedas Schedulexxxx) No assuranceis giventhat this Inventoryis yet complete, andno&#13;
guaranteeis given as to the qualityof the outputfromthe activitieslisted in this Inventory.&#13;
&#13;
      The AssociatedProjects are thosewherethe subjectmatter overlapsparticularly closely&#13;
withthe goals of this Project, wherethe quality of the work is regardedas good, and whichin&#13;
manycases formedknown antecedentsof the Project. Ofparticular importancewill be a seriesof&#13;
diagnosticstudiesandreform plansto be undertakenwithIBRD loan fundingin parallel with&#13;
thisProject, in the six subjectsparticipatingin thisProject - but AssociatedProjects are in no&#13;
senselimited to these studies.Attentionshouldthereforebe given to the output of all Associated&#13;
Projects,and activeworking dialoguebe establishedwhereverpossible.&#13;
      Whereverpossible,output materialfromthe AssociatedProjectswill be made availablevia&#13;
the FMD to thoseworking on TA componentsof this Project - this materialwill eventuallyform&#13;
onecore componentof alibrary to be developedby FMD inthe courseof this Project.&#13;
&#13;
      Conversely, it is expectedthat all other suitablesource materialcreated or locatedby those&#13;
working on the componentsof this Project, that is not yet in the Inventory,will be passed on for&#13;
inclusionin the Inventory andin the library, andto that extentbe in the public domain.&#13;

need is alreadylargelyor partially satisfied by AssociatedProjects.Otherprecedent needsof&#13;
somecomponentsare a directtopic for other components.&#13;
&#13;
      Thoseinvitedto contributeTA underthis Project will be requiredto informthemselvesas&#13;
closelyas possibleaboutthe output of the AssociatedProjectsand otherrelevant componentsof&#13;
this Project, to evaluateit andwhereverpossibleto incorporateit in earlyprovisional&#13;
recommendations,that will allow dependentactivitiesto move ahead. In due course,providersof&#13;
TA will be expectedto verify or correctthe implied assumptionsabout the validity of this&#13;
precedentwork, and wherenecessaryto issue amendedrecommendations.&#13;
&#13;
      Many of the componentsof this Projectthereforecall for Provisional Outputs,basedon&#13;
workassimilatedfrom elsewhere (AssociatedProjects,or other componentsof thisProject), to&#13;

&#13;
      1. Background&#13;
&#13;
      The RussianFederationhas undergonesignificantreformsin its systemof&#13;
intergovernmentalfiscal relationsoverthe past six years. TheBudget Code, approvedby the&#13;
Duma,andPart I of the Tax Codethat became effectivein January 1999,address many aspects&#13;
of two of the four pillars of any systemof intergovernmentalfiscalrelations: fiscal management&#13;
andbudgeting, andrevenue andtax assignments,respectively.The two otherpillars of a system&#13;
of intergovernmentalfiscal relations,expenditureassignmentsandthe systemof transferswill&#13;
need to beaddressedin separatelegislation.&#13;
&#13;
      Lack of clarityin expenditureassignmentsbetween the federal,regional,and local&#13;
governmentscontinuesto be a vexing problemin the systemof intergovernmentalfiscal&#13;
relationsin the Russian Federation.The issue of expenditureassignmentsis addressedinthe&#13;
Budget Codebut without sufficientdetail andclarity. Lack of clarity in expenditureassignments&#13;
andthe extensiveuse of unfundedexpendituremandatesfromupper-levelgovernmentsthreaten&#13;
to result in inefficientexpenditurepatterns and fiscallyirresponsiblebehavior.&#13;
&#13;
      The Governmentintroduceda formula-drivensystemof equalizationtransfers in 1994,the&#13;
FederalFund for Assistanceto the Regions (FFSR).This systemwas changedevery year since&#13;
itsintroductionand it was practicallyabandonedin the formulationof the 1998budget. All&#13;
parties involved,the Government,the regionsand the Dumawere dissatisfiedwith the&#13;
performanceof the FFSR. The Governmentwill be using a new buttemporary formula for the&#13;
1999budget.The Governmenthas announcedits intentionof overhaulingthe systemof transfers&#13;
for future yearsstarting withthe budget for 2000.&#13;
&#13;
      Much of the reform process overthe pastsix yearshas focusedon the fiscal relations&#13;
betweenthe federaland regionalgovermments.Less attentionhas been givento intra-oblast&#13;
intergovernmentalfiscal relation issues.The generalbudgetaryprinciple has been that the&#13;
regionalgovernmentshad the freedomto organizetheir system of intra-regionalfiscal relations&#13;
in anyway they saw fit. Althoughsomeregionshave movedto reformtheir budgetary&#13;
relationshipswith local governmentsin amore stable and transparentfashion,the majorityof the&#13;
regionalgovernmentsare still using a budgetaryapproachbased on negotiationand bargaining,&#13;
the benchmarkthat characterizedthe budget systempriorto 1992. In 1997,the Law on the&#13;
FinancialFoundationsof LocalSelf-Governmentsmandatedto the regionsthe introductionof&#13;
reforms suchas minimum sharingrates fortax revenueswith localgovernments andthe use of&#13;
formula-basedtransfers.But these provisionscontainonly generalprinciplesand concrete&#13;
applicationsstill await development.Most regionalgovernmentsappearto have delayedthe&#13;
introductionof formula-basedtransfersbecause of a lack of understandingon howto proceed.&#13;
&#13;
      Over the past several yearsthe budgetaryprocess and fiscal managementat the federal&#13;
levelhavebeen subject to significantchangesand improvementsin the Russian Federation.A&#13;
modem budget classificationsystembased on the IMF's GovernmentFinance Statisticshas been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                37&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
introduced,a Treasuryfunction for budget executionis near completion, andex-post audit is&#13;
performed by the Chamberof Accounts.&#13;
&#13;
      However,budgeting andfiscal managementat the sub-nationallevelin the Russian&#13;
Federation,with somepossibleregionalexceptions,has failedto keep pace withthe reformsat&#13;
the federallevel.The budget formulationprocess basicallyhas not evolvedfromthe previous&#13;
regime'spractices,there is no modem treasuryfunction for budget execution,ex-postaudit is&#13;
spottyandthere is no evaluationof budgetpolicies.Whilethe newly approvedBudget Code&#13;
attempts to address someof these deficienciesat the sub-nationallevel, it does not address in&#13;
sufficientdetail the necessaryreforms infinancialmanagement,accountingandreporting at the&#13;
regional andlocal level.There appears tobe aconsensusthat a sub-nationalgovernmentbudget&#13;
codewill be necessaryto deal appropriatelywith all outstandingissues.&#13;
&#13;
      In most subjects,intra-regionalbudgetaryrelationsare still characterizedby expenditure&#13;
assignmentsbetween the regionalandlocal governmentsthat lack clarityand stability.In&#13;
addition,the problem of unfundedexpendituremandatesfromthe regional authoritiesto local&#13;
governmentscontinuesto be a sourceof frictionandinefficiencyin the use of scarce budgetary&#13;
funds.Finally, in most subjectsrevenue assignmentsstill lacktransparencyandpredictability,&#13;
thus detractingfromthe abilityof local governmentsto plan ahead and destroyingany incentives&#13;
localgovernmentsmayhave to mobilizetheir own revenues.Fundamentalreformof intra-&#13;
subject intergovernmentalfiscalrelations facesthe handicapof lack of incentivefor regional&#13;
governmentsto reform. Regionalgovernmentstend to feel quite comfortable withthe current&#13;
negotiatedsystembecause it providesthem withdiscretionand flexibility.&#13;
&#13;
      An issue of significantimportance is the exerciseof fiscal responsibilityby sub-national&#13;
governmentsin the area of borrowing.Whilethe new Budget Codewill restrictand impose&#13;
limits on the ability to issue bonds anduse other formsof borrowingby sub-national&#13;
governments,andthese shouldbe furtherdevelopedin a sub-nationalbudget code,there is at&#13;
present no adequatereporting systemand mechanismfor enforcementof sub-nationalborrowing&#13;
limits by the federal authorities.Sometime inthe futurethis controlmay be exercisedby the&#13;
capital marketsthemselvesbut at the presenttime direct control by the federal authoritiesis&#13;
necessary.Lack of enforcementof borrowing limitsis likelyto be destabilizingat the national&#13;
level,compromisingmacroeconomicstability.&#13;
&#13;
      It shouldbe clearly understoodthat ex-antecontrolsby the Ministry of Finance or any&#13;
otherfederalauthorityof borrowingby sub-nationalgovernmentswill be unnecessarily&#13;
restrictive andbureaucratic.The limitson sub-nationalborrowingin the Budget Code areof a&#13;
regulatoryex-postnature, and they do not grantany powersto the Ministryof Finance to&#13;
approveex-anteborrowing by sub-nationalgovernments.What still needsto be addressedis how&#13;
the federalauthoritieswill ensureex-postthat sub-nationalgovernmentsdo respect the&#13;
borrowinglimits introducedinthe Budget Code andwhatmeans or powers need to be grantedto&#13;
the federalauthorities.The developmentof adequatedisclosurerules for the fiscal health of sub-&#13;
nationalgovermmentsshould contributeto the foundationsfor the creation, in the future, of a&#13;
self-policingsystemfor sub-nationalborrowingwithinthe capital marketsthemselves.This will&#13;
be the most effectiveand efficientway to imposefiscal disciplineamong sub-national&#13;
governments.The sub-nationalbudget code will needto address loan default andbankruptcy&#13;
proceedingsfor sub-nationalgovernments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               38&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      There is onelast aspect of the overalllegalframeworkgoverningthe systemof&#13;
intergovernmentalfiscal relationswhichrequires attention.Over the past six yearsmany laws&#13;
have been passed on budgeting and financialmanagement,revenue sharing,transfers,and&#13;
assignmentof functionalresponsibilities.In addition,there has been considerablevariationin the&#13;
degreeof enforcementof these laws. In somecases,the laws have not beenmuch more than&#13;
proclamationswithpractically no implementation.Asa consequence,inconsistenciesand&#13;
contradictionsamong severalof these laws are quite common.The most recentexample is&#13;
providedby the contradictionsbetweenthe BudgetCode andthe Law on the Financial&#13;
Foundationsof Local Self-Governmentconcerningthe budgetaryrelationshipsbetweenregional&#13;
andlocal governments.A systematicstudy of all current legislationon intergovernmental&#13;
relationspointing out inconsistenciesand contradictionsis neededto get rid of this significant&#13;
sourceof confusioninthe system.&#13;

                  STANDARDS      FORREGIONALFINANCIALMANAGEMENT&#13;
&#13;
      1. Background&#13;
&#13;
      Among the weakest aspectsof the systemof intergovernmentalfiscal relationsin the&#13;
Russian Federationis the lack of mechanisms for monitoringby the federalauthoritiesof fiscal&#13;
performanceby regional andlocal governments.At thepresent time, regionalgovernmentsare&#13;
underthe obligationto reportthe executionof the consolidatedregional budgets(regional&#13;
governmentbudget plus the combinedbudgetsof all localgovernmentsin the region).However,&#13;
this reporting is insufficientto providethe necessary informationon compliancewith federal&#13;
policies (suchas costrecovery on public utilities), actualbudgetarypractices (suchas the&#13;
existenceand importanceof extra-budgetaryfunds), or the level or extent of fiscal equalization&#13;
across local governments.&#13;
&#13;
      Thelimited and aggregatednature of financialreporting by regionaland localgovernments&#13;
doesnot allow, at the presenttime, establishmentof a clearpicture of their fiscal health.Even&#13;
thoughregionalgovernmentsreport consolidatedbudgetdata to the Ministryof Finance,these&#13;
data reveallittle informationon the actual deficitpositionof sub-nationalgovernmentson a&#13;
commitmentor accrual basis.For most cases,the budgetdata providesinsufficientinformation&#13;
to evaluatethe size,change and age of existingbudgetaryarrears. The budget data available&#13;
provideno informationeitheron the revenuecosts to regionaland localbudgets of tax&#13;
preferencesgranted to enterprises,nor actual lending or loan guaranteesby regionalandlocal&#13;
governmentsto enterprises.Nor has there been little consistent infornation on the level of&#13;
borrowing,debt servicerequirements,and compositionof debtfor regionaland local&#13;
governments.Thetransparency,and ultimatelythe validity, of sub-nationalbudgetsis also&#13;
compromisedby the lack of disclosure andinformationon extra-budgetaryaccounts andthe use&#13;
of non-cashpaymentmethods.&#13;
&#13;
      The lack of quantitativeinformationinregionaland local reportedbudget accounts is&#13;
complicatedby the lack of informationanduniformityon budgetaryprocedures andaccounting&#13;
systems.There is little informationon the constraintsthat are placed onthe use of extra-&#13;
budgetaryaccountsby agencies(andeven by departmentsor divisionswithin administrations),&#13;
andwhatthe existingreporting requirementsandsafety checksare. There appearsalso to be a&#13;
wide arrayof practices acrossregionaland local governmentsinbudget planning arrangements,&#13;
includingrevenue forecasting,current expendituresand capital investments.Very few regional&#13;
andlocal governmentsappearto have in placean appropriatetreasury functionwith cash and&#13;
debt managementand reporting of budget guarantees.A widevariety of approachesare used by&#13;
regionalgovernmentsto fund localgovermnents.Non-transparentarrangemnentsincludingnon-&#13;
repayableloans andmutual settlementsappear tobe quite common.In general,there is little&#13;
informationaboutthe degreeof complianceby sub-nationalgovernmentswithfederal norms&#13;
pertainingtothe budgetprocess and fiscal managementandless informationon actual&#13;
budgetarypracticesby sub-nationalgovernmentsinthose areas wherethe law givesthem&#13;
discretion.&#13;

2. Objectives&#13;
&#13;
     Thisprojectcomponenthasthefollowingmainobjectives:&#13;
&#13;
     &gt; To executeor commissionresearch into fact andpractice in localgovernmentfinances&#13;
         in Russia. Much of the factual productof this research will be inthe public domain,&#13;
         servingas a "library"of informationon Russianregionalfinance.However, some&#13;
         analyticalconclusionsmaybe closelyheld within government.&#13;
&#13;
     &gt; To advisethe Government,IMWG andthe Ministryof Finance on improving all&#13;
         aspects of the legal andregulatoryframeworkfor regionalgovermmentfinancesin&#13;
         Russia. This will includeall aspectsof budgeting,accountingand the preparationof&#13;
         financial reportsfor electors/taxpayers,centralgovernment,management,suppliersand&#13;
         creditors;intergovernmentalfiscal relationsbothFederation/Subject,and Subject/City-&#13;
         Rayon includinginter aliatax and expenditureassignmentsand inter- and intra-&#13;
         governmentalfiscal transfers; andthe setting of standardsfor financialmanagement&#13;
         generallyin regional governments.FMD will both advisethe IMWG on the desired&#13;
         contentandstructure of legislation/regulation,andassist in coordinatingthe drafting&#13;
         andpromulgationin atimely andconsistentmanner.&#13;
&#13;
     &gt; Toprovide ongoingmonitoringandsupervisionof all aspectsof Russian regional&#13;
         financewithinthe revised regulatoryframeworkon the basis of the data collected&#13;
         throughits research.FMD willmake regularrecommendationsto the Government,&#13;
         IMWG andthe Ministryof Finance on a widevariety of questionsrelated tothe fiscal&#13;
         reformin the regions.&#13;
&#13;
   3. Outputs andindicators&#13;
&#13;
A. StandardMonitoringSystem&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The StandardMonitoring Systemwill respond tothe Federal Government'sneedto maintain an&#13;
up-to-dateunderstanding of the fiscal and financialcondition,andthe state of compliancewith&#13;
federallegislationand regulations,of each of the 89 Subjectsof the Russian Federation.&#13;
&#13;
      Standard monitoringis envisaged as a computer based system, operating primarily on the&#13;
basis of objective,numerate,non-judgmentalinputsfed througha structure that so far as possible&#13;
builds upon or adapts existing data sources,rather than creating entirelynew structures.&#13;
&#13;
     The main tasks within this sub-componentwillbe to:&#13;
&#13;
         Specifythe indicatorsthat shouldbe trackedto achieve the purposesof Standard&#13;
         Monitoring;these are likelyto includecompliancewith all the main provisionsof&#13;
         Russian sub-nationalpublic financelaw andregulation, includingparticularlythe&#13;
         setting and executionof budgets withinlegal constraints,the level of debt, the level and&#13;
         dynamicof deficits,andthe manner (cashor offsets)of budget execution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               43&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      ·  Identify sourcesand flows of data that can be used for this purpose;and specifythe&#13;
         deficienciesin form, content,accuracyor verificationstatusof this data, andwhat&#13;
         needsto be doneto make it availablein acceptableform.&#13;
&#13;
      ·  To specifyand designthe mechanismsfor collectingand presenting thisdata routinely,&#13;
         in as near as practicable to real-time,includingthe computerand communication&#13;
         systemsrequired.&#13;
&#13;
      * To specifythe personnel and systemsresourcesrequired to install this mechanism,and&#13;
          to assist the FMD in itsimplementation,includingsystems design,recruitmentand&#13;
          training.&#13;
&#13;
     Associatedprojects and preliminarywork suggestthat substantialdata resourcesandflows&#13;
already exist,but that they are badly co-ordinated,and not used systematicallyto addressissues&#13;
relevant tothe needs of Standardmonitoring;moreover,current legaland regulatorystructures&#13;
have meantthat the informationis oftennot in formand contentas useful as would be desirable.&#13;
&#13;
      The developmentof monitoringneeds will thereforerequire substantialdialoguewith the&#13;
developmentof accountingand reportingneedsand withthe development of legal and regulatory&#13;
structures.This dialogueforms part of the provisionaloutput of each of the activities&#13;
participatingin it.&#13;
&#13;
     Provisional Outputs:specificationof the form andcontentof input data required (to enable&#13;
the reformplans of participatingregionsto incorporatethese regionsas "pilots"for the&#13;
monitoringprocess), and discussionwith the relevantfunctionalexperts of any changesto the&#13;
accountinganddisclosure requirementsdesirableto improvethe disclosureand accuracyof key&#13;
variables.&#13;
&#13;
     Definitive Outputs:specification,implementationanddeliveryto FMD, of a working&#13;
systemto achievethe goals of StandardMonitoring.&#13;
&#13;
     PrincipalIndicators ofsuccess at the provisionalstage will be the recognitionof&#13;
monitoringneeds into the main functionalreviews(particularlyaccounting,debt, andtreasury);&#13;
the inclusion of monitoringinfo-sourcerequirementsin the specifications for regulatorychange;&#13;
and the inclusionof StandardMonitoringdata provisionin the reforrnplans for the participating&#13;
regionsas "pilots".&#13;
&#13;
     B. Extendedand SpecialMonitoring System&amp;Ratings&#13;
&#13;
     ExtendedMonitoringis intendedto provide the mechanismby which the Federal&#13;
Governmentcan develop a closerunderstandingof financialand economic circumstances,and&#13;
the degree of reform attainment,in regionswhich areparticipatingin the currentProject, or&#13;
whichare seeking conditionalcredits or otherdiscretionarybenefits fromthe federal&#13;
government.Such regions will alsobe requiredto participate in StandardMonitoring- the&#13;
Extendedrequirementsare incremental,not substitutes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 44&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     Tothe extentthat suchdiscretionarybenefitsare availableas aninducement for desired&#13;
reforms,when penalty sanctionsmay notbe availablefor constitutionalreasons, Extended&#13;
Monitoringwill providethe main tool for determiningwhere such discretionshouldbe granted,&#13;
and hence bea substantiveinstrumentof policy. Extendedmonitoringmay also servea&#13;
secondarypurpose,in helping withthe analysisof the effects of other grantsandpolicy actions&#13;
undertakene.g. in responseto the intergovernmentalfiscal analysis.&#13;
&#13;
     This sub-componentaddressesboth the specificationof the ExtendedMonitoring&#13;
standards,andthe design andconstructionof mechanismsfor tracking attainrmentsagainstthose&#13;
standards.As with StandardMonitoring,thiswill include:&#13;
&#13;
      * Specifyingthe indicatorsto be monitored.&#13;
&#13;
      * Specifyingthe data and informationsourcesrequiredto monitor them, andidentifying&#13;
         any enhancementsrequiredto render current sourcesof such data effectivefor this&#13;
         purpose.&#13;
&#13;
      * Specifyingand designingthe mechanismsfor collectingand analysingthis data,&#13;
          includingthe computerand communicationsystems required,and the extentof local&#13;
          representation.&#13;
&#13;
      * Specifyingthe personneland systems resourcesrequired to implementthe&#13;
          recommendations,and assistingFMD inthe introductionof an effective Extended&#13;
          monitoringcapacitywithin the Project'stimetable.&#13;
&#13;
      The ExtendedMonitoringstandardsthemselvesare likely to be closelyrelated to the&#13;
standardsspecifiedin the Code of Good Practice,but may alsocontain a numberof other&#13;
quantitative(creditworthiness)or qualitative(governance)indicatorsdesignedto provide a close&#13;
understandingof compliance,and of commitmentand attainmentinthe implementationof&#13;
reforms.The standardsinvolved will be graduatedand progressivetoprovide a measure&#13;
attainment,andprovide abasis for incentives,across a wide rangeof levels of attainment.&#13;
&#13;
      Tlheevaluationbased on these criteria is then likelyto be used as a basis for an internal&#13;
"rating"of sub-nationalgovernments,as well for specificdiscretionarycreditdecisions.&#13;
&#13;
      Substantialcomponents of the ExtendedMonitoringrequirementsare likelyto be available&#13;
fromthe provisional outputof sub-component3, fromAssociatedprojectmaterial, andfrom the&#13;
IBRD'sloan conditionalities.Equally,theprovisional conclusionsfromthis sub-componentas to&#13;
whatwill be suitablecomponentsof Good Practicewill be requiredas provisional inputto the&#13;
regionalreformplans andthe development of the extra-legalframeworkin Component 1. Given&#13;
its extra-legalcharacter,it is desirablethat the Good PracticeCode is the subjectof extensive&#13;
consultationandexplanationwith the regionsto which itwill apply, andthat so far as possibleits&#13;
contents are acceptedby and agreedwith them. This workwill interlockclosely withthe FMD's&#13;
overallco-ordinatingrole inthe Project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 45&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     Provisional outputswill thereforeconsistof contributionto the specificationof the&#13;
standardsof GoodPractice, and the data flows, analyticalresources, andall other faculties&#13;
necessary for the continuingappraisalof reform implementationin the six initial participating&#13;
regions,andthe definition of the resourcesrequiredto deliverthis appraisalon a continuing&#13;
basis, for an increasingnumber of regions.&#13;
&#13;
     Definitive OutputsImplementationof the appraisalstructure, andits successfuloperationto&#13;
producea means tomonitor progress of the participatingregions.Installationof the graduated&#13;
ratingprocess, and its applicationto awideningcadre of regions.Publicationof the Codeof&#13;
GoodPractice, andits developmentafter debate intoan accepted standardfor reformoriented&#13;
regionsto aspireto.&#13;
&#13;
     Theprincipal indicatorsofsuccess in this sub-componentwill be the extentto whichthe&#13;
provisionaland definitiveoutputson the designatedtopics are availablein timeto allowother&#13;
projectcomponentsto move forwardon schedule.The extentto whichthe Codeof Good&#13;
Practiceis really accepted by the participatingregions- and by other investors,thereby&#13;
deepeningthe incentivefor its adoptionby otherregions- will be important,as willbe the&#13;
extentto whichit providesa continuumof incentiveacross a range of attainments,rather than a&#13;
single-standardhurdle.&#13;
&#13;
C. Fiscal StatisticalDatabase&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The FMD, in its co-ordinatingrole for regional financegenerally,will operatea central&#13;
informationresource non behalf of regions andall otherinterested parties. Much of this&#13;
informationwill be in the public domain;but some aspectsof it may be designatedas restricted&#13;
to certaincategoriesof user, or for internaluse only.&#13;
Thetopics to be covered by this informationresourceshould be availablein paper or electronic&#13;
form,and shouldbe accessiblethrough a websiteto be createdfor thepurpose.&#13;
Thetopics will include:&#13;
&#13;
     * RegionalBudget statistics,developedfromthe StandardMonitoringdata flow.&#13;
&#13;
     · Additionalbudget and economicstatistics,developedfrom otherdata sources,to provide&#13;
        greatertransparencyfor comparisonbetween regions,and as abasis for external&#13;
        investmentdecisions andgovernmentpolicy research.&#13;
&#13;
     * Definitive statementsof Good Practicestandardsandthe proposed public finance&#13;
        detailed applicationmanualand backgroundmaterialon their introductionin practice&#13;
        (where,how, what tools).&#13;
&#13;
     * AnInventory of donor fundedand otherwork in Russia (includingtraining materials),&#13;
        that can serveboth as atheoreticalbasis andas apractical "toolkit" for the&#13;
        implementationof public financereformsin the directionsrequired.&#13;
&#13;
     The contents of this librarywill almostall be theproduct of other sub-componentsof this&#13;
Project,and hence dependenton that otherwork; the task of this sub-componentwill be the&#13;
assemblyandpresentationof this material. Conversely,the product of this resourcewill be an&#13;
&#13;
                                                46&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
importantingredientfor the widertake-up of the reformspromoted by this Project.It is&#13;
particularlyimportantthat it is presentedandpublicisedin such a way as to be seenby regionsas&#13;
a resourceusefulto them, rather than an impositionon them.&#13;
&#13;
      The tasks of this sub-componentwill be the detailed identificationof content;the&#13;
identificationof sources;the specificationof the necessarycommunicationand computer&#13;
facilitiesto collect,store andpresent the data;the specificationof premises,personnel andother&#13;
logisticalresourcesrequired;andthe implementationof these objectiveswithinthe life of the&#13;
Project.&#13;
&#13;
      The Provisionaloutputsof this sub-componentwill includeparticipationinthe&#13;
specificationof the data content andformat requiredfor monitoring,and in the identificationand&#13;
disseminationof suitableAssociatedProject materialto allow othercomponentsto make rapid&#13;
progresstowards their respectivetasks.&#13;
&#13;
      The Definitiveoutputswill be the installationand operationof a mechanismfor the&#13;
collectionstorageand deliveryof the specifieddata categories.&#13;
&#13;
      The Indicatorsof success will includeboththe mechanicalaccomplishmentof the required&#13;
outputs,to a timescalethat facilitatesthe completionof other projectcomponents on time, and&#13;
also the acceptanceof the resourceby regions, investors,other parts of government,and third&#13;
parties, as a definitiveresource anda helpful contributiontowardstheir own goals.&#13;

 ASSISTANCETO SUBNATIONALGOVERNMENTSIN ACCOUNTINGAND BUDGETING&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     1. Background&#13;
&#13;
     CurrentRussian budgetrules and accountingconventions are clearlyat odds withthe&#13;
western"BestPractice" standards:rigid use of a cash(rather than accrual) convention;lack of&#13;
balancesheetsor reliable asset/liabilityledgers; inconsistentconsolidationof sub-districtsand of&#13;
extra-budgetaryfunds; lack of properdistinctionbetween operatingandcapital/financingitems&#13;
are amonga few examplesof major shortcomings.Thishas clouded managementand public&#13;
understandingof manyreal issues resultingin anon-transparentsetting of budgetsandfinancial&#13;
reportsby regional governments.&#13;
&#13;
      Amongmany problems are alreadyidentified:&#13;
&#13;
      &gt; Theuse of a "cash" conventionwhichrecognizestransactionsonlywhen settledin&#13;
         cash.This has led to a systematicbuild-upof unsettledaccounts payable(not&#13;
         recognizedas an expenseuntil paid - hence a budget outcomemay be "balanced"&#13;
         simplyby not settlingthe bills; and an apparentlybalancedbudget seton the basis of&#13;
         not expectingto settlethe bills);&#13;
&#13;
      &gt; Unclear andinconsistentconsolidationrules whichhave confusedthe estimationboth&#13;
         of flowsof revenuesand expenses,andof aggregateliabilitiesof budget entities;&#13;
&#13;
      &gt; Lack of reliable asset and liabilityrecordsand of a balance sheet,which have prevented&#13;
         the normal verificationof flow entriesthroughdouble-entrycross checks;&#13;
&#13;
      &gt; Absenceof accrualconventionswhichhas left someconfusionoverthe true costfor&#13;
         exampleof zero couponor foreigncurrency debt, or the consumption of Capitalassets;&#13;
         and hence an inabilityto know the true cost of servicesdelivered.&#13;
&#13;
      Budget formationand implementationhas thereforebeen taking place against abackground&#13;
of fallingrevenue,rising social need, anduncertainty.Majorresponses have includedcutbacksto&#13;
near zero ininfrastructureinvestment; a generaldeclinein the level and standardsof many&#13;
services(apparentlyoften with limitedcapacity to measurethe effectivenessor efficiency of&#13;
servicesthat areprovided), in deliberatedelaysin settlementof many purchase invoicesfor&#13;
goods and services;and in an increasingtendencyto borrow.&#13;
&#13;
      In parallel with this component,a seriesof regionaldiagnosticreviewsand reformplans is&#13;
being undertakenin the six participatingregions(also fundedby IBRD loan finance).Ongoing&#13;
closedialogueis essentialbetween the consultantsundertakingthese studies, andthe consultants&#13;
working on this component:recommendationson budget andaccountingreform must both&#13;
respond to the findingsof the diagnosticreviews (anda number of otherAssociatedProjects&#13;
withthe same goalsin other places), andprovide direct guidanceback to the reform plans.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

      requiredlevel of budget management,public sectorrestructuring,accountingand financial&#13;
      reporting.&#13;
&#13;
      The end product is intendedto be a mechanismfor the formation,agreement,&#13;
implementation,control, andreporting on budgets,that is bothmore effective inextracting&#13;
service fromlimited resources,andmore responsiveto the needs of the relevant stakeholders.&#13;

      F. RegionalFiscal ManagementGuidelines,Best Practice Standards,Local PublicFinance&#13;
Manual&#13;
&#13;
      Thistask is essentiallythe drawingtogetherof the specificfunctional analysisand&#13;
recommendationsof the components3 and4 into a coherentset of recommendationsboth for&#13;
targets for broadstandards (theCode of GoodPractice),and detailedimplementation(the&#13;
draftingof a Manual of Public Finance).Bothtasks will have aniterative element, inensuring&#13;
that the proposalsare internallyconsistent betweendifferentprojectsub-components,that they&#13;
are consistentwith federalgovernmentobjectives(by closedliaison with FMD), and that they&#13;
are realisticallyattainablewithinthe timeframespecified.&#13;
&#13;
      The provisional recommendationsnecessaryto allow this activityto get started are&#13;
themselveslikelyto bebased substantiallyon provisionaloutputs fromcomponent3, and on the&#13;
AssociatedProjects.As the Project progresses,these provisional outputswill matureinto more&#13;
definitiveoutputsbased on the refined inputs.&#13;
&#13;
      Thistask will thereforebe continuouslyinvolved in the assembly anddistributionof&#13;
progressivelymaturingprovisionaloutput, andin two way feedbackwiththe FMD, those&#13;
involvedin the tasks inthis component3, andother componentsof the Project. The creationof&#13;
&#13;
                                               51&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
consistencybetween the constituentsof GoodPractice andthe ExtendedMonitoring&#13;
requirements;the correspondencebetweenthe separatefunctionalrecommendationsandthe&#13;
recommendationsfor legal reform;and the integrationof sectoralreform recommendationsinto&#13;
the regionalreform programs,will be specifictasks. The collectionof the constituent&#13;
recommendationsfor GoodPractice,and the correspondingdetail inthe PublicFinance manual,&#13;
willbe a task of this sub-component.&#13;
&#13;
     For each of these sub-components,provisional outputswill includea substantial&#13;
contributionto the iterativeprocess of developingthe enhancedlegaland regulatory&#13;
environment,andthe reformplans for the regions.The definitiveoutputswill bethe eventual&#13;
specificationof the relevant componentsof GoodPractice(in partnershipwith other&#13;
contributors),the preparationof the relevantsectionsof the detailed PublicFinance Manual,and&#13;
the provisionof tools andpracticalimplementationtechniquesto assist in the attainmentof the&#13;
standardsspecified.&#13;
&#13;
      TheIndicators ofsuccess on each of these sub-componentswill be the extentto whichthe&#13;
analysisidentifiesreal issues, andthe consequentrecommendationsrespond withproposals that&#13;
successfullyaddress these issues in away that is attainablewithinpracticalresource constraints.&#13;
An understandingby the regionsof the reasons for and benefitsof the recommendationswill be&#13;
essential.Progresson the regionalreformprogrammes,the creationof the creationof anagreed&#13;
Codeof GoodPractice, andthe completionof the legal/regulatoryreformprocess, will all be&#13;
indicatorsof whetherthese goals have beenachieved.&#13;

      These reviewswill take the form of a seriesof studies,one for each sectorto be examined,&#13;
to assist regionaland localgovernments inthe designof rationalisationstrategiesfor the sector&#13;
concerned,by costing alternativescenarios,and explainingstrategyoptions for adjustmentsto&#13;
the levelsof service capacity-andunit cost.&#13;
&#13;

conductedin tandemwith the diagnosticreviewson regionalfinance, andeach of the 9 sectoral&#13;
reviewsshould study at least two of the 6 participatingregionsin detail; each of the 6&#13;
participatingregions shouldbe the subjectof at least 3 such reviews.&#13;
&#13;
      Thereviews should incorporatewhereverpossibleas provisional inputsthe output from&#13;
AssociatedProjects,andthe work of the regionaldiagnosticstudies as it relatesto financial&#13;
management.As the Project progresses,there will be increasingoutput of managementtools&#13;
from otherparts of the Project, that can be incorporatedinto the sectoralreforms.&#13;
&#13;
      Each of the reviews should then provide as an output the sectoral reform part of the&#13;
regionalreformplan for the respectiveregions.&#13;
&#13;
      These sectoralreformplans will includerecommendationsas to:&#13;

&#13;
1.     SummaryandKey Findings&#13;
&#13;
       FER is a well organizedPIU with a clearlydefinedorganizationalstructureand qualified&#13;
staff Over the next twelve to eighteenmonths it isproposed that it will becomeproject&#13;
implementationunitfor three-newIBRD loans with minimalincreasesin staffing with its core&#13;
financefunctions. This is an ambitiousaim which will only be achievedifprocesses and&#13;
informationtechnologyare integratedand automated.In the case of theMigration and Forestry&#13;
Projects itfaces significant capacitybuilding issues withinregionalproject implementation&#13;
groups. Theseare issues whichare currentlybeing addressedbyFER management,butthe Bank&#13;
must also be alert to these accountabilityissues inprojectpreparation.&#13;
&#13;
    The Bank needsto adapt to the challengesposed by multi-projectPIU's byproviding greater&#13;
focusparticularly inthe monitoringof operationalbudgetsandfinancial managementsystems&#13;
and reporting.&#13;
&#13;

disbursement,financialmanagementand contractmanagement.Costs of the generalservices&#13;
departmentsare allocatedto operatingcosts categoriesof all projects inproportion reviewed and&#13;

&#13;
3. ProjectAccountingSystemsandProcedures&#13;
&#13;
3.1. AccountingSystems andReportingRequirements.&#13;
&#13;
    Currentfinancial reportingis divided ontoFER entityreporting whichis handled by the&#13;
accountingdepartment andprojectfinancial reportingwhichis conductedby the Finance&#13;
Departrnent.The financialreporting systemneeds tobe capableof producing several different&#13;
types of reports,including:&#13;
&#13;
* Annualprojectmanagementreportsin accordancewithBank requirements&#13;
* QuarterlyProject ManagementReportsin conformitywith Bankrequirements&#13;
* AnnualFER financial statementsprepared inaccordancewith IAS (maybe transformedfrom&#13;
    Russianfinancial statementsat the year end)&#13;
* AnnualFER financialstatementsprepared in accordancewith Russian Legislation&#13;
* Reportsprepared at request of InternationalFinance OrganizationDepartmentof the&#13;
    Ministryof Finance andProject Finance Center&#13;
&#13;
       Entityaccountingis performed on Inotech accountingsoftwarepackage usedby&#13;
approximatelyfifteenother World Bankprojects in the Russia portfolio. Project financial&#13;
reportingis prepared fromwithdrawal applicationsand summarizedon anExcel Spreadsheet.In&#13;
1998the Bank requiredFoundation accountspreparedunder InternationalAccountingStandards&#13;
(IAS)for the first time.At the time of preparingthis assessmentthese financial statementswere&#13;
still outstanding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                65&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      Thereis a lack of interfacebetween projectand entity financial statements;a significant&#13;
issue that exists acrossthe Bank's entire Russiaportfolio. Asproject financial statementsare not&#13;
part of the double entry book-keepingsystemkeyinternal controlssuch a overall cash&#13;
reconciliationare not built into the system.Thesecan be addressedby othersub-optimalinternal&#13;
controls,externalaudit reviewsand Bank supervisionbutthe mediumterm solutionis to more&#13;
fully integratethe two systems.The programfor the integrationof the two systemsis plannedto&#13;
be completedby December31, 2000 at the latest.The precise details and extentof the&#13;
integrationwill bereviewed as part of the consultancycontractmentionedbelow.&#13;
&#13;
      In accordancewith Bank's requirementsFER has to prepare entity's financialstatements&#13;
annuallyinaccordance withIAS and ProjectManagementReports(PMR) quarterly.&#13;
Managementof FER recognizethe importanceof linking PMR's totechnical analysis of Project&#13;
Managersand this is being given particular attentionin the preparationof the new projects.&#13;
&#13;
      In orderto meet Bank's requirementsthe computerizedaccountingsystemof FER need to&#13;
be strengthenedto provide higher levelof automatizationand internalcontrol. FER is currently&#13;
addressingthis issue througha consultancycontractwiththe followingterms of reference:&#13;
&#13;
* carryout a diagnosticon the statusof bookkeepinginthe Foundationin accordancewith&#13;
    Russian accountingstandardsand IAS&#13;
·   developa procedure to maintain businessaccountingin FER using available software&#13;
    accordingto two standardssimultaneously&#13;
· preparationof operational chartsof accountscorrespondingto localand international&#13;
    standards&#13;
&#13;
    As well as the abovethe consultantwillprepare recommendationsand delivertraining. The&#13;
success of this initiativeis extremelyimportantin the overallsuccess of the overalloperational&#13;
strategy of FER whoseaim is to achieve significantefficiencygains in the face of a growth in&#13;
activityprojected in the next twelve to eighteenmonths.&#13;
&#13;
    In additionto support of the consultant,the Bank agreedto review the overallformat of&#13;
FER's entityfinancial reportsand the projectfinancialmanagementreports.It is particularly&#13;
importantto Bank supervisionthat there is a transparentlink between entitybudgeted and actual&#13;
operationalcosts and individualproject componentcosts.&#13;
&#13;
3.2. Budget preparationandexecution&#13;
&#13;
      Budgets areprepared for all FER's activitiesincludingannual operatingbudgets.The&#13;
Boardof Directors is responsiblefor approvingannual budgetsand ratifies anychanges. The&#13;
Projectplanning process in performedunder guidanceof Project ImplementationCommittees. In&#13;
accordancewithBank's requirementsactual data on project implementationis comparedwith&#13;
the budgetson regular basis. An issue for the Bank is how operational expensebudgets within&#13;
the Foundationare calculatedand apportionedto individualprojects. The overall annual&#13;
operatingbudget of FER will be submittedto the Bank's CountryUnit for no-objectionone&#13;
month prior to submissionto the Board of Directors.The Bank's CountryUnit will alsoreview&#13;
compliancethroughex-postmonitoringof the financialreports of the Foundation andprojects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               66&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.3. InternalControl Procedures&#13;
&#13;
      InternalControlProceduresof the FER are documentedin Operationalmanual,and control&#13;
proceduresare alsoextensivelydefinedunder Russian legislation.FER managementcompleted&#13;
an InternalControlQuestionnaireof the Bank.Procedurescoverthe followingmain areas of the&#13;
project implementation:budget preparationand execution,contract preparationand signing&#13;
(procurementprocedures),disbursement,assets management,etc. As notedabove additional&#13;
proceduresareneeded in orderto ensurethe appropriatecontrol overthe allocationof general&#13;
servicesdepartmentcosts to project operatingcost categories.Thesewill be incorporatedinto&#13;
the OperatingManualand are subjectto the Bank's priorapproval.&#13;
&#13;
      Themanagementof all projects will bethrough oneruble projectaccount in which&#13;
counterpartfundsand ruble denominatedtransactionfromindividualprojects SpecialAccounts&#13;
are held. If this approach is to be adopted it must be withinan environmentof sound integrated&#13;
chart of accountandinternal control surroundingthe reconciliationof the project account.This&#13;
should be explicitlyaddressedin the terms of referenceof the consultantengaged in the&#13;
integrationof accountingand financial systems.TheBank assessmentteamhas addressedthese&#13;
concernsto the Foundationand if it were not for strengthof the managementandfmanceteam&#13;
we wouldreject the approach in favorof separateringfenced project account.Neverthelesswe&#13;
support the effortsbeing made in terms of the efficientprojectmanagementandtrust that, if&#13;
there optimum systemsolutionscannot be achievedthen they will explore alternative and&#13;
possibly more expensiveoptionsrequiring additionalfinance staff.&#13;
&#13;
3.4 AuditArrangements.&#13;
&#13;
      In accordancewith Bank's requirements,audit of the projectwill be performed annuallyin&#13;
accordancewith Standardsacceptableto the Bank. Russian auditingcompanyFBK audits each&#13;
year all projects implementedby FER andFoundationas an entity. In order to ensurea&#13;
consistentapproachto the financialmanagementwithinthe PIU we-recommendthat the&#13;
principleof a single auditorfor all projects within FER be continued.&#13;
&#13;
4. Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
      FER proposesto implementthe new projects with minimal growth in centralsupport&#13;
functionsof financeand disbursement.Thisis to be achievedin part by the impendingclosureof&#13;
existing projects.The plan is ambitiousand is dependenton significantefficiencyand&#13;
rationalizationof system softwareand internal controlprocedures.It also carries a significant&#13;
risk in projectimplementationas FER tendersfor projects with MinFin with limited roomfor re-&#13;
negotiationduringimplementation.&#13;
&#13;
      Two of the new projectshave significantRegionalComponents(Forestry andNorthern-&#13;
Out Migration)and part of FER's responsibilitieswill includecapacitybuilding, training and&#13;
compliancewith Bankreporting requirements.This is likelyto be a significantand time&#13;
consumingtaskto be managedwith existing financeand accountingstaff.&#13;
&#13;
      We have foundthe managementof FER addressingthese key issues and believetheir&#13;
strategydeservessupport pendingthe outcomeof the work by the consultants intheir&#13;
recommendationsregarding the accounting systemsof the Foundation.&#13;
&#13;
                                                 67&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      The other key finding is that the Bankneedsto address the supervisionof key elementsof&#13;
the supervisionof multi-project PIU's on a more integratedbasis in relation to the fiduciary&#13;
elements of financial management,review and approvalof operational expensesandreviews of&#13;
project andentity financialreporting.&#13;

&#13;
PART I. REGIONALFISCAL TECHNICALASSISTANCEPROJECT&#13;
&#13;
1.    GovernanceStructure&#13;
&#13;
      The Federal Governmenthas createdan Inter-ministerialWorkingGroup (IMWG)to&#13;
represent their interests in the project.This group is composedof representativesof Ministryof&#13;
Finance, Ministryof RegionalPolicy, Ministryof Economy,Apparatusof the President,the&#13;
WorkingCenter of Economic Reformsandthe Foundationfor EnterpriseRestructuring.To&#13;
supervisethe project activitiesduringprojectimplementationthe Board of Directors of FER will&#13;
approvethe IMWG as a Project ManagementCommittee(PMC). Thiscommitteewill represent&#13;
both the regionaland federalauthorities (seeparagraph2.1 for overviewof FER's governance&#13;
structureand the role of PMC's).&#13;
&#13;
Theproject is divided into fivecomponents:&#13;
&#13;
ComponentA - Strengtheningof Federal andRegionalFiscalLegislation - this componentwill&#13;
providetechnicalassistanceto improve the existing frameworkof intergovernmentalfiscal&#13;
relations.Counterpartsfor this componentare the Ministryof Finance, State Duma,Federation&#13;
Counciland the PresidentialAdministration.&#13;
ComponentB - Strengtheningof Federal MonitoringCapacityandthe Developmentof&#13;
Standardsfor RegionalFinancialManagement-improvingcomplianceof the regions with&#13;
existing federallaws and regulations.&#13;
&#13;
ComponentC - Assistanceto Sub-nationalGovernmentsin Accountingand Budgeting-&#13;

efforts.&#13;
&#13;
ComponentD - SectoralPublic ExpenditureReviews&#13;
&#13;
2.    Regulations andProcedures&#13;
&#13;
      TheProject Operating manualwill coverthe projectdescription,projectmanagement&#13;
system,financialprocedures,implementationarrangements,disbursementproceduresand&#13;
internalcontrol procedures.This manualwill bepresented for Bank's reviewand approvalin&#13;
accordancewiththe ActionPlan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 68&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.    OrganizationalStructureand Staffing&#13;
&#13;
      An Order of the Ministryof Finance was signedon June 29, 1999establishinga Regional&#13;
Fiscal MonitoringUnit (RFMU) withinthe Departmentof Inter-budgetaryRelations,whose role&#13;
will be to monitorregional financeandto managethisproject. Initiallythis is budgetedto have&#13;
five MOF staffbut this is budgetedto increaseto xx overthe duration of the Project.This will be&#13;
headed by AlekseyLavrov.&#13;
&#13;
      To supportthe MOF staff inthe implementationof the projectthe RFMU will use a&#13;
number of short term consultantswho will reportdirectly to Mr. Lavrov.The projectdesign&#13;
assumes that as consultancystaff will reduceduring the life of the project as Ministryof Finance&#13;
staffare trainedand drawn into the division.&#13;
      FER would perform the functionsof the ProjectImplementationUnit for the Project.&#13;
Duringprojectpreparationand implementation,FER will provideprocurement,disbursement,&#13;
accountingandfinancialreporting services.Individualconsultantcontractsare being signedby&#13;
FER but withaccountabilityclearlyto managementwithinRFMU. The followingchangeswill&#13;
bemade inthe existingorganizationalstructureof FER (also seePart I for the assessmentof the&#13;
existing structure).Unlike other projects withinFER no separateproject groupwill be formed&#13;
withinFER as all technicalissueswill be dealtwith in FiscalMonitoring Center.&#13;
&#13;
      Withinthe General Servicesdepartment,two additional procurementspecialistswill be&#13;
requiredwithin FER. Operatingcosts of FER will befinancedunder this loan. The general&#13;
Servicesdepartmentof FER works on a cost-sharingbasis with otherprojects under&#13;
implementationby the Foundation.&#13;
&#13;
4.    Budget preparationandexecution&#13;
&#13;
      In accordancewith the generalbudgetingprocedure describedin the Operatingmanual,&#13;
FER's annual operatingbudget is approvedby the Boardof Directors.This budgetincludes&#13;

projectimplementation.&#13;
&#13;
5     ProjectAccounting SystemsandProcedures&#13;
&#13;
      Under all componentsconsultants contractswill be signedby FER on behalf of RFMC.&#13;
The agreementsreached in orderto strengthenproject accountingsystems are addressedin detail&#13;
in PartI. Ministryof Financewill issue instructionsto the RFMCto ensure recordson&#13;
counterpartfundsare providedto FER for the preparationof financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                69&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
      In additionto the abovereporting requirements,FER will submit quarterlyProject&#13;
ManagementReports(PMRs)to the Bank.For each quarterlyreport FMC will preparea textual&#13;
analysis of the progress of projectimplementation,whichwill be attached to the financial report&#13;
submittedto the Bank. Thecompositionand formatof the Project PMRs will be drafted by FER&#13;
and the Bankwill provide its commentsas providedfor in the actionplan.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
7     Audit Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
      As noted in PartI of the assessment,it is recommendedthat one auditor is procuredfor all&#13;
projects implementedby FER. The appointmentof projectauditor will be a condition of&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
8     Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
      The overall conclusionis that FER has sufficientcapacity to implementthe proposed&#13;
RegionalFiscal TechnicalAssistanceProjecteffectively,although FER needto payparticular&#13;
attentionto the accountabilityand internalcontrol procedureswithinthe FMC whichhas no&#13;
experiencein project management.The followingactions were agreed withFER in orderto meet&#13;
the Bank's financial managementrequirementsprior to project effectiveness.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Regional Fiscal Technical Assistance
            Project for the Russian Federation aims to build
            institutional capacity for advancing the reform of
            inter-governmental fiscal relations and improving fiscal
            performance at the sub-national level. There are four
            project components. The first strengthens federal and
            regional fiscal legislation by financing international
            experts and local consultants, equalization transfers for
            the regions, federal regulations that monitor sub-national
            fiscal performance, and analysis of existing legislation on
            sub-national public finance and inter-governmental fiscal
            relations. The second component strengthens federal
            monitoring capacity, specifically providing technical
            assistance to fortify institutional capacity in designing,
            implementation, and monitoring structural reforms and
            performance at the sub-national level. Expenditures include
            computer and information technology, the creation of a
            library and on-line databases, development and dissemination
            of principles of good practice for regional financial
            management, design of financial disclosure requirements,
            ongoing monitoring of fiscal and structural reforms and
            compliance with federal laws and regulations, analytical
            support and policy advice, training, as well as office
            furnishings and administrative and computer support. The
            third component assists sub-national governments in
            accounting and budgeting while the fourth component finances
            sectoral public expenditures reviews.
