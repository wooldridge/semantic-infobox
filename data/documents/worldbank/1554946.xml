SOCIOCULTURAL ASPECTS OF DEVELOPING SMALL-SCALE FISHERIES:&#13;
DELIVERING SERVICES TO THE POOR&#13;
The purpose of this paper is neither to advocate nor condemn fisher-&#13;
men-s cooperative organizations. As will be seen in the report, there are&#13;
sufficient individuals and organizations that take one of these two extreme&#13;
positions. This report, rather, is a response to the following, well-&#13;
established facts:' (1) many developing countries mandate the use of fisher-&#13;
men-s cooperatives in small-scale fishery development; (2) some development&#13;
agencies advocate the use of fishermen's cooperatives; (3) there have been&#13;
numerous failures, as well as successes, of fishermen's cooperatives.&#13;
These facts, which are elaborated in the body of the paper, suggest&#13;
that there is a need for an objective examination of the cooperative in the&#13;
context of small-scale fisheries development programs. It is hoped that such&#13;
an examination can lead to more rational evaluation of this widespread&#13;
organizational form.&#13;

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS&#13;
The author would like to acknowledge the valuable insights provided&#13;
by the thousands of fishermen he has interviewed in various parts of the world&#13;
over the past seven years. He would also like to thank the numerous government&#13;
fishery officers who provided him with another perspective on fishermen's&#13;
cooperatives. Special acknowledgement must be given to his colleague Dr J.J.&#13;
Poggie who kindly allowed him to use his collection of FAO material concerning&#13;
fishermen's cooperatives.&#13;
Finally, the author is grateful to the World Bank, especially to&#13;
Michael Cernea, Fujio Kada, Jacob Lesueur, Francis Lethem, A. Sfeir-Younis,&#13;
Lucien Sprague, and Lars Vidaeus as well as the participants in the Bank's&#13;
Sociological Workshop on Fishery Projects in March 1981, who made many helpful&#13;
comments concerning the content and structure of this paper. To respond to&#13;
all the helpful comments would take several papers this size; thus, all&#13;

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
i.        This paper presents a framework for assessing the sociocultural&#13;
feasibility of small-scale fishery projects. The fishery development project&#13;
is examined in its sociocultural matrix, and decision points encountered in&#13;
the generation, appraisal, and implementation of projects are addressed step-&#13;
wise. The relation between technology and social organization in small-scale&#13;
fishing communities is regarded as providing the essential context for the&#13;
institutional system used to deliver project services, such as loans for&#13;
equipment and new technology, to the poor, which is the principal focus of&#13;
the paper. In most developing countries the institutional mechanism used&#13;
is that of the fishermen's cooperative. In many cases, the governments of&#13;
developing countries consider use of a cooperative to be mandatory in&#13;
fishery-development projects. If for no other reason, this fact justifies&#13;
examination of the cooperative as an important and final link between donor&#13;
agencies and their targets--the poor.&#13;
ii.       Although the cooperative is often a critical factor in small-&#13;
scale fishery-devel'opment projects, the attention given it in many World&#13;
Bank fishery projects is on the whole cursory. As noted in the text,&#13;
fishery cooperatives will apparently figure to a greater or lesser extent&#13;
in 57 percent of recent Bank-assisted fisheries projects. The discussions of&#13;
cooperatives in the appraisal reports, however, were too brief to determine,&#13;
in many instances, the extent to which cooperatives would be employed.&#13;
Further, although fishermen's cooperatives are notorious for a high rate of&#13;
failure in development projects, little or no attention was paid in these&#13;
project appraisals to sociocultural factors associated with their potential&#13;
success or failure.&#13;
iii.      As an instrument for addressing this gap in the preparation and&#13;
design of fishery projects, the present paper can be used in preliminary&#13;
stages of sociocultural information planning for projects that indicate a need&#13;
for intermediary organizations such as cooperatives for the delivery of&#13;
project services. The paper addresses three questions concerning information&#13;
planning and use: What specific kinds of information will management need for&#13;
decision making? At what specific points in the implementation process will&#13;
the information be needed? How will the information be collected, analyzed,&#13;
and organized?&#13;
iv.       The first section of the paper is an outline of the structure of&#13;
*the small-scale fishery development process, emphasizing the importance of&#13;
sociocultural factors to the success or failure of a project. Tradeoffs&#13;
between increased technological efficiency and social considerations such as&#13;
unemployment and greater social stratification are examined in the light of&#13;
their potentially negative effects. It is argued that in some instances&#13;
existing labor-intensive fishing systems are preferable to technologically&#13;
more efficient systems that may cause an increase in local unemployment and&#13;
may create social problems that would outweigh the anticipated economic&#13;
efficiency in the human misery they would bring and the welfare programs&#13;
that they would entail. In some cases the fishermen perceive these costs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
and maintain the traditional work force, thereby reducing the economic&#13;
efficiency of the new technology and possibly becoming worse off economically&#13;
because of capital costs.&#13;
v.        Another potential problem addressed in the first section is that&#13;
of the equitable distribution of wealth in small-scale fishing communities.&#13;
Project-supplied new technology, more costly than the old, is frequently&#13;
affordable only by the wealthy fishermen or others who are already well off.&#13;
This new technology provides them with considerable further advantage over&#13;
the poorer fishermen, thus bringing about greater social and economic&#13;
stratification, with its potentially disruptive social effects.&#13;
vi.       The fishermen's cooperative has been seen by many as a possible&#13;
solution to the problem of modernizing technology and maintaining equity in&#13;
small-scale fishing communities. In the second section the use of coopera-&#13;
tives in development projects assisted by international organizations such as&#13;
the World Bank and the FAO is examined. Significantly, in some instances in&#13;
which development agencies are neutral or negative with respect to the use&#13;
of cooperatives, governments of developing countries frequently mandate their&#13;
use.&#13;
vii.      The third section outlines some social, cultural, and institutional&#13;
problems usually encountered during the development of fishermen's coopera-&#13;
tives. It is clear that one problem with the use of fishermen's cooperatives&#13;
is caused by government guidelines, which often carry legal force and are&#13;
frequently based on the European model. In many respects this model is not&#13;
compatible with the needs and circumstances of developing countries. Other&#13;
problems arise out of attempts to model fishermen's cooperatives upon agri-&#13;
cultural cooperatives. Sufficient differences exist between the activities&#13;
associated with farming and fishing to make such a model unworkable. The&#13;
section outlines some characteristics of fishermen's society and culture&#13;
that tend to conflict with attempts to establish cooperatives. It is&#13;
suggested that many times leaders of cooperatives could learn a great deal&#13;
from traditional middlemen who have adapted their methods to the specific&#13;
requirements of the occupation of fishing. The section contains examples&#13;
of attempts to establish cooperatives that were socially and culturally in-&#13;
compatible with the fishery. Problems examined ranged from incompatibilities&#13;
of loan-repayment procedures and residency requirements to the need for&#13;
independence among basic units of production in the fishery. The relations&#13;
of these factors to basic aspects of man's technoeconomic and sociocultural&#13;
adaptation to fishing clearly indicate the need for flexibility in the&#13;
official guidelines for the establishment of cooperative organizations.&#13;
Finally the section offers examples of successful fishermen's cooperatives,&#13;
with the observation that the successful ones are usually formed by the&#13;
fishermen themselves, with little or no outside interference. This develop-&#13;
ment from below enhances the likelihood that they will be compatible with&#13;
existing conditions in the fishery.&#13;
viii.     In section four the kinds of sociocultural data needed for&#13;
designing fishermen's cooperative development programs are set forth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Examples are given to illustrate the techniques to be used for coll.ecting&#13;
and analyzing the data needed for designing successful cooperatives. Such&#13;
data should refer to the structure of fishermen's relations with traditional&#13;
middlemen, as contrasted with the proposed function of the cooperative, and&#13;
to fishermen's perceptions, and therefore their expectations, concerning&#13;
cooperative organizations. The data collected and analysed in the examples&#13;
discussed clearly illustrate a signigicant amount of variability with&#13;
respect to these critical variables within a relatively small region. This&#13;
variability suggests that an overall, uniform plan for cooperative development&#13;
is unlikely to be successful. Regional variability with respect to social and&#13;
cultural variables must be taken into consideration, and the cooperative&#13;
developed to fit regional and local needs.&#13;
ix.       The concluding section presents functionally relevant recommenda-&#13;
tions for determining where knowledge of social and cultural variables is&#13;
needed in the decision-making process concerning the establishment of fisher-&#13;
men's cooperatives. A flow chart illustrating decision points in the con-&#13;
sideration and development of fishermen's cooperatives is provided to serve as&#13;
a guide to be used in the preparation and appraisal stages of project develop-&#13;
ment. Of primary importance among the decision points are those that touch&#13;
upon the social and cultural feasibility of fishermen's cooperatives and&#13;
evaluation of existing legal requirements concerning cooperative formation.&#13;
Attention to such variables, as well as to others outlined in the recommenda-&#13;
tions, is essential to the successful use of fishermen's cooperatives in&#13;
fishery-development projects.&#13;
x.        In sum, the consequences of sociocultural variables for the estab-&#13;
lishment and development of small-scale fisheries through the medium of&#13;
fishermen's cooperatives are examined and found to be crucial. Examples are&#13;
provided of both successes and failures that could be attributed to socio-&#13;
cultural variables. It is stressed throughout, however, that successful&#13;
fishery development depends upon adequate consideration of biological,&#13;
technical, and economic information as well, but also that the sociocultural&#13;
information is not less important than the technical for making sound financial&#13;
decisions.   Examples of the generation of data and its conversion into&#13;
information of use to decision-makers are detailed, and diagrams illustrating&#13;
the flow of the processes used in the establishment and monitoring of fisher-&#13;
men's cooperatives are presented and discussed. A feature common to all dia-&#13;
grams is the feedback loop; thereby the importance of the process or "adaptive&#13;
research" model of development is emphasized. Sufficient failures exist in&#13;
the domain of small-scale fishermen's cooperatives to indicate that no&#13;
prepackaged fishermen's cooperative can be assured of success thoughout the&#13;
developing world. Thus, while providing a sociological working frame the&#13;
paper emphasizes that the specific details are to be filled in through the&#13;
process of adaptive research in the many and varied small-scale fishing&#13;
communities of the world.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I. IDENTIFICATION AND DEFINITION&#13;
OF SOCIOCULTURAL INFORMATION NEEDED IN FISHERY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS&#13;
1.1       The purpose of this section is to provide a description of the&#13;
process of development of the small-scale fishery and indicate the contribu-&#13;
tion of sociocultural information to this process. The section can be used&#13;
as a guide from which the fisheries development planner can make a checklist&#13;
of sociocultural information that is needed in connection with specific&#13;
projects. It also provides the essential context of this paper, which is an&#13;
examination of the fishermen's cooperative--the system most frequently used&#13;
to deliver project services to small-scale fishermen in the developing world.&#13;
1.2       Figures 1-3 are simplified diagrams that illustrate the various&#13;
points in a small-scale fisheries project at which critical decisions are made.&#13;
The figures are also useful in identifying the information required for&#13;
decision-making, and they will serve to emphasize the multidisciplinary nature&#13;
of a fisheries-development project. The focus of these diagrams is on the&#13;
data that are required for effective decision-making. Although the infra-&#13;
structure is briefly referred to in the diagram, it will not be emphasized,&#13;
since the primary concern here is the harvesting sector. It is assumed that&#13;
adequate studies and projections of the development of the handling, proces-&#13;
sing, distribution, marketing, and consumption sectors will have been made.&#13;
1.3       The assumption underlying Figure 1 is that there is a need to&#13;
increase the supply of animal protein; the fishing sector seems to present&#13;
the most cost-effective investment opportunity; there is, or there will be,&#13;
a demand for fish products; and sufficient fresh fish are not now available&#13;
to meet the projected demand? It is at this point that a fisheries develop-&#13;
ment project may be deemed desirable. 1/&#13;
1.4       Once a fisheries-development project has been deemed necessary, a&#13;
critical decision is whether sufficient fish resources are available. At&#13;
this stage in the decision-making process a preliminary evaluation of the&#13;
resource can be made on the basis .of statements by fishermen concerning the&#13;
availability of fish or available catch statistics. If the preliminary&#13;
assessment of resources suggests that sufficient stocks are available, then&#13;
the infrastructure for providing supplies, processing, and distribution should&#13;
be evaluated. If sufficient infrastructure exists, it is possible to make a&#13;
1/   There are, of course, other paths that could lead to a decision to&#13;
develop the fishery. For example, a need for foreign exchange in&#13;
combination with a marine resource that commands high international&#13;
prices, as for shrimp or lobster. Alternatively, the decision to&#13;
develop the fishery could be made on the basis of a need to' improve&#13;
the quality of life of the small-scale fisherman. In the latter&#13;
case, some sort of a market for the product must be identified or&#13;
the project will not be self-sustaining. Finally, a need to&#13;
provide employment opportunites for unemployed rural poor might be&#13;
used to justify a small-scale fisheries-development project.&#13;

decision concerning the evaluation of resources, but if the infrastructure&#13;
needs improvement, it will be necessary to conduct a cost-benefit analysis of&#13;
improvement of the infrastructure to provide sufficient support for projected&#13;
production needs. If this cost-benefit analysis demonstrates that benefits of&#13;
improving the infrastructure would justify the costs, a more detailed assess-&#13;
ment of resources can be planned. If the cost-benefit analysis is negative,&#13;
then the project should probably be abandoned or reformulated.&#13;
1.5       The decision to assess resources cannot be taken lightly.   There&#13;
are several levels of resource assessment; they vary all the way from judge-&#13;
ments made on the basis of. observations by fishermen that they have no&#13;
trouble catching all the fish they want to sophisticated tagging and sampling&#13;
techniques. In regions where there is little or no fishing, and fishermen&#13;
seem to have no trouble catching all the fish they want, a preliminary&#13;
decision can probably be made that there is no immediate need for assessment&#13;
of stocks. If this decision is made, however, initial development should be&#13;
small and should include a well-designed program to obtain statistics on&#13;
catch and effort for future assessments of stock to insure proper management&#13;
of the resources. If there is any doubt about the stocks, fishery development&#13;
should be postponed until adequate assessments have been made.&#13;
1.6       If the resource evaluation shows that the stocks are insufficient&#13;
to justify increased exploitation, the possible causes of this inadequacy&#13;
should be determined. Is it attributable to environmental causes, such as&#13;
pollution and changes in the climate, or is it the result of excessive harvest-&#13;
ing? If stocks are either overexploited or on the margin of overexploitation,&#13;
some type of management plan must be formulated. Fishery management can be a&#13;
difficult and expensive process, however, which is sometimes beyond the reach&#13;
of many developing countries (CF. Pollnac and Littlefield 1981). Nevertheless,&#13;
when future benefits of such management would exceed costs, international aid&#13;
agencies should consider supplying assistance in the development and implemen-&#13;
tation.of a management plan. At this point, a decision can be made to maintain&#13;
the status quo if the catches are not excessive. If catches are excessive&#13;
however, plans must be made to reduce effort. At this point the decision&#13;
could also be made to explore the possibilities of developing aquaculture to&#13;
provide more fish. 1/&#13;
1.7       Figure 2 illustrates decision points In the development of plans&#13;
to reduce effort. In a region in which acceptable alternative employment&#13;
opportunities for displaced fishermen exist, the decision-making process is&#13;
1/   As a means of limiting the scope of the discussion here, this paper is&#13;
concerned only with the capture fishery. If an aquaculture project is&#13;
decided upon, the diagram could be entered at the "Increase Effort"&#13;
decision point, and the word "fishermen" could be changed to&#13;
"Aquaculture Production Units."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

simplified: it is necessary only to perform biosocioeconomic cost-benefit&#13;
analyses of effort-reducing alternatives. 1/&#13;
1.8       Where acceptable alternative employment opportunities do not exist,&#13;
but prices paid to fishermen can be increased to the point that present levels&#13;
of profit can be maintained with reduced effort or projected decreases in&#13;
income are within acceptable limits as ascertained by the reactions of fisher-&#13;
men, it is possible to proceed with evaluation of effort-reducing alternatives.&#13;
If the level of financial strain is not acceptable, the only alternative is to&#13;
retrain fishermen for acceptable alternative employment.&#13;
1.9       If it is determined that the stocks can support greater effort, then&#13;
a decision must be made concerning techniques for increasing effort. One&#13;
factor that should influence the decision-maker is the degree of unemployment&#13;
in the target region. If many people are unemployed, then the rational&#13;
decision is to increase the number of fishermen as a means of both increasing&#13;
-the supply of fish and providing productive employment. If unemployment is&#13;
low, the possibility of introducing more efficient technologies should be&#13;
considered.&#13;
1.10      If a socioeconomic cost-benefit analysis of unemployment in the&#13;
target region points to a decision to introduce a more effective technology,&#13;
alternative technologies should be subjected to a sociobioeconomic cost-&#13;
benefit analysis. Biologists, for example, should consider the relations&#13;
of the technologies to MSY; economists should conduct standard cost-benefit&#13;
analyses and should consider the cost of the technology in relation to the&#13;
fishermen's purchasing power. In all cases attempts should be made to select&#13;
a more efficient technology that is within the means of working fishermen.&#13;
This is sometimes impossible.&#13;
1.11      Several aspects of the technology of small-scale fisheries involve&#13;
relationships that differ somewhat from those found in agrarian social groups&#13;
(cf. Pollnac 1976). It is therefore important to examine the relations&#13;
between small-scale fishing technology and certain aspects of the ownership of&#13;
productive equipment, the structure of work groups and other groups and the&#13;
degree of social stratification. An understanding of these relations will&#13;
make it possible to predict the costs involved in alternative processes of&#13;
technological change and will thus enable the planner to weigh the costs&#13;
1/   These alternative employment opportunities must be acceptable to the&#13;
fishermen. This involves assessment of fishermen's attitudes toward&#13;
these occupations in comparison with fishing. It cannot be assumed&#13;
that a fisherman will undertake a given form of employment simply&#13;
because it is available. Further, the present emphasis in the World&#13;
Bank and other development agencies on "basic human needs" suggests&#13;
that the ability of these alternative occupations to provide for the&#13;
displaced fisherman "a sense of purpose in life and work" must be&#13;
considered (Streeten 1979:30).&#13;

against the benefits of introducing the technology. In earlier papers, I drew&#13;
on the available literature and research experience, 1/ to develop a model&#13;
which indicates that vessel size and complexity affect both the size of the&#13;
crew and the recruitment of crew members on the basis of skill. It should be&#13;
noted here, however, that more efficient equipment that reduces the size of&#13;
the crew that is needed may cause unemployment and increase social stratifica-&#13;
tion. The model also indicates that crews are often selected on the basis of&#13;
social criteria such as membership in kin groups. Work groups of small-scale&#13;
fishermen, however, tend to be egalitarian in structure owing to the fact that&#13;
many shipboard tasks require close cooperation among fishermen. These close&#13;
ties among crew members often lead to the formation of male groups on shore&#13;
that are based on the maritime work group. The model demonstrates further&#13;
that the generally low cost of small-scale fishing technology, the short-lived&#13;
nature of the equipment caused by the destructive nature of the sea, and the&#13;
close cooperation required on board usually mean that there is little social&#13;
distinction between owner and laborer within small-scale fishing groups.&#13;
Nevertheless, as the costs of equipment increase on account of increased&#13;
size or complexity, the likelihood that individual fishermen will own their&#13;
own equipment decreases, thus promoting the development of social stratifi-&#13;
cation and inequality. Further, increases in the costs of capital equipment&#13;
often lead to the development of specialists in financing. Finally, as&#13;
surplus production increases, there is an increasing need for specialists in&#13;
distribution and processing. The structure of these various interrelations&#13;
between small-scale fishing technology and social organization can be found&#13;
in Figure 4. Preproject data are needed on all points in Figure 4 in order&#13;
to estimate the changes that a given technological change will bring about.&#13;
To estimate change it is necessary to evaluate the complexity, labor&#13;
requirements, cost, and productivity of the technology-variables that are,&#13;
of prime importance in the relations between technology and social organiza-&#13;
tion as illustrated in Figure 4.&#13;
1.12      At this stage of the discussion it is perhaps appropriate to&#13;
introduce concrete examples to demonstrate the interrelations between tech-&#13;
nological and institutional changes and aspects of social organization&#13;
contained within the model developed in the preceding section. A study con-&#13;
ducted by Fraser (1966) among Malay fishermen of South Thailand provides a&#13;
good example of the effect of technological change on work groups and on&#13;
various aspects of a sociocultural system. Traditionally, the Malay fisher-&#13;
men of Rusembilan relied on oars and sails to take them to their fishing&#13;
grounds. In 1956 groups of boat owners and steerers -- the steerer tradition-&#13;
ally having high status in the boat crew-dominated deliberations concerning&#13;
the best way to motorize the fleet. They decided to introduce towboats to&#13;
take fishing vessels to fishing areas and bring them back. Groups of boats&#13;
were to form tow groups that would be associated with a particular towboat.&#13;
This new technology immediately placed considerable strain on the tradi-&#13;
tional social system.&#13;
1/   Sources for empirical data supporting the generalizations made&#13;
in this section of the paper can be found in Pollnac (1978C, 1979).&#13;

1.13      First, membership in a tow group meant that individual boat crews&#13;
and steerers lost the independence they had enjoyed with regard to locating&#13;
fish and timing their return to market. Second, after a period of poor&#13;
fishing, wives of members of the more skillful crews realized that they were&#13;
subsidizing less successful crews, since shares were based on the tow group s&#13;
total catch. Fraser (1966) notes that this situation had broad repercussions&#13;
in other areas of community life. It caused overt hostility among women, and&#13;
relations among men became strained.   The coffee shops, which were the focal&#13;
points for community decision-making groups and for boat crews, manifested a&#13;
marked drop in attendance, reflecting the social strains. Attendance at&#13;
coffee shops never fully recovered. Further, traditional village authority&#13;
figures, the orang baik [morally good men], were involved in ownership of tows&#13;
and their operation; thus, the chief source of authority and means of maintain-&#13;
ing village control were undermined. Finally, because the religious leaders&#13;
of the village remained aloof from the changes, their status increased.&#13;
Before long, the strains became too great, and the tow boats were eliminated.&#13;
The reindividualization of fishing did much to restore good relations, but&#13;
the degree of community organization, originally based on boat-crew member-&#13;
ship, and the traditional authority of the orang baik, whose traditional&#13;
status depended on affiliation with a boat group, was never regained. Further,&#13;
the introduction of nylon nets and individual motorized vessels reduced the&#13;
need for large crews; nevertheless, the crews were maintained larger than&#13;
necessary in keeping with their traditional structure. Fraser (1966) argues&#13;
that this feather bedding, together with diminishing catches, undermined the&#13;
sense of pride that traditionally characterized crews. This reduction of&#13;
group solidarity had a negative effect on the status of the steerer and,&#13;
hence on his status in the community.&#13;
1.14      Thus a change in technology that was ill-adapted to the traditional&#13;
social structure of work was rejected, and the negative changes that occurred&#13;
in the traditional social structure were never totally corrected. Further,&#13;
traditional social organization dictated a crew size that made the application&#13;
of other technological innovations inefficient. A similar reluctance on the&#13;
part of small-scale fishermen in Malaysia to change the structure of the work&#13;
group was recently reported. Sabri (1977) notes that although winches were&#13;
installed, thereby reducing the number of fishermen needed on a vessel,&#13;
traditional crew size was maintained in order to provide employment for&#13;
members of the extended family.   In another area of Malaysia, however, Yap&#13;
(1977) reports that improved technology caused reduction of the crew size&#13;
and significant unemployment among fishermen who had no alternative occupa-&#13;
tions. This impoverished class of unemployed fishermen, of course, in-&#13;
creased the degree of social stratification within the fishing community,&#13;
as could be predicted from the model in Figure 4.&#13;
1.15      In Figure 3 it can be seen that the attitudes of the participants&#13;
toward the proposed change must be considered. The introduction of new&#13;
technologies or new people to the fishing industry is a change that cannot&#13;
be made unless the participants are willing to change. It is obvious--but&#13;
the point is often overlooked--that if the participants refuse to cooperate,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
the project will not succeed. Often this reluctance to cooperate is based&#13;
on rational considerations that can be worked into the project design if&#13;
they are known beforehand. It is therefore necessary to consider what the&#13;
attitudes of the participants concerning the proposed changes are likely&#13;
to be and how their beliefs and values will be affected. This involvement&#13;
of the target population in early stages of planning is an important&#13;
ingredient in the success of a project (cf, Long and Oleson 1980, Morss&#13;
and others 1976).&#13;
1.16      If attitudes are negative, then it is essential to determine&#13;
the reason and attempt to adjust the changes to the perceived needs of the&#13;
people. If attitudes are positive, then success in the use of a new tech-&#13;
nology or the addition of more fishermen depends on the availability of&#13;
skilled personnel--another decision point at which detailed information is&#13;
needed. If there is a lack of skilled personnel, some sort of training&#13;
program should be developed either to retrain fishermen in the new technology&#13;
or teach unemployed people how to fish.&#13;
1.17      Once sufficient skilled personnel are available, the only obstacle&#13;
between the fisherman and the capture technology is the ability to finance&#13;
the changes. If this ability is lacking, decisions must be made concerning&#13;
the extension of credit. If the distribution of capital is highly unequal&#13;
in the target region, implementation of the project could increase social&#13;
stratification, and other social problems are likely to follow (cf. Pollnac&#13;
1976). In many instances the only people who can take advantage of new&#13;
opportunities are those who are already well off, and the new technology&#13;
only improves their situation in relation to that of. others.&#13;
1.18      The model presented in Figure 4 outlines the relations between&#13;
technological change, cost of equipment, patterns of ownership of equipment,&#13;
and social stratification. Once again, some concrete examples from fishery&#13;
development projects are in order. Epple (1977) provides a good example of&#13;
the way patterns of ownership of fishing boats were altered because mechani-&#13;
zation had caused the prices of equipment to increase. Before mechanization,&#13;
90 percent of the fishermen owned their own boats. Following mechanization&#13;
this figure dropped to 25 percent. Sabella (1974) notes that as Peruvian&#13;
small-scale fishermen began to depend on expensive, highly specialized&#13;
equipment, their fomerly egalitarian community began to manifest signs of&#13;
social stratification. Finally, among Malay fishermen, rises in the costs of&#13;
productive equipment associated with modernization have brought into being a&#13;
class of equipment owners. Firth (1966) has noted that although modernization&#13;
of equipment has produced greater overall returns, increasing capital costs&#13;
have led to a marked drop in the earnings going to the labor force. Despite&#13;
the fact that in the new system, the fisherman has become, in effect, an&#13;
employed laborer, he is treated as a participant in a common enterprise and&#13;
thus he is not paid regular wages.   His income is still based on a share of&#13;
the catch. Firth (1966) notes that among the Malay fishermen, costs are&#13;
subtracted from the proceeds of the cach before shares are calculated, thus,&#13;
because of the periodic nature of production in the marine environment,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
fishermen often receive next to nothing. He reports that in 1963 therefore,&#13;
the fishermen were in a less advantageous position than when he first studied&#13;
them in 1939-40, and that the entrepreneurs were much more powerful than their&#13;
predecessors a generation earlier.&#13;
1.19      Even when governments are aware that the higher initial costs of&#13;
new technologies are likely to bring greater social stratification problems&#13;
arise and disparity in wealth widens.   Alexander (1975) reports, for example,&#13;
that in Sri Lanka the government was aware of the problems of financing costly&#13;
new fishing technology, so they introduced a hire-purchase scheme. Those who&#13;
took part were selected by ballot from among qualified applicants. The&#13;
individual fisherman had to make a deposit, and he received a government loan,&#13;
repayable in the course of five years, to purchase a hull boat with an engine.&#13;
Unforeseen problems arose, however. First, the deposit, together with the&#13;
fact that the loan covered vessel and engine, but not gear, meant that the&#13;
fisherman had to go to private moneylenders. Second, the new equipment&#13;
deteriorated faster than the old, and there was no provision of maintenance&#13;
funds. Third, the terms of repayment of the loan were not related to the&#13;
value of the catch: payments were fixed monthly amounts. Thus, during an off&#13;
period the payment might exceed income. Nevertheless, production increased,&#13;
so the government saw the project as a success and invested more funds in it.&#13;
The total income to the fishing village increased, but other, less visible&#13;
problems also increased. Since the number of fishermen increased little&#13;
through the years after the innovation was first introduced, and the popula-&#13;
tion continued to increase, there was growing unemployment. New boats were&#13;
introduced, but they rightfully went only to experienced deepsea fishermen.&#13;
Important for this discussion, however, is the fact that inexperienced&#13;
recruits were drawn only from relatives of fishermen; therefore, few oppor-&#13;
tunities to acquire the experience necessary for allocation of a boat existed&#13;
for those not related to the boat-owning elite. The elite in the community is&#13;
larger than it was in the past, but the large group of free middle-class&#13;
peasants are finding life much more difficult, and there is now a substantial&#13;
elite, while the bulk of the population has been reduced to the poverty level.&#13;
Alexander (1975) suggests that since the elite have political power and&#13;
control recruitment to the most favorable occupations, the degree of social&#13;
stratification will become even more marked in the future. Increases in&#13;
social stratification have been attributed to similar factors in other&#13;
communities where costly innovations were introduced (cf. Norr 1972).&#13;
1.20      Clearly the introduction of new, relatively costly technologies can&#13;
bring disparities in income and associated increases in social stratification.&#13;
If decisionmakers deem such a situation undesirable, then ways of extending&#13;
credit to the needy should be investigated. If there are local structures for&#13;
extending credit, such as development banks and fishermen's cooperatives, they&#13;
should be used. If not, structures suitable to the local situation should be&#13;
developed, ideally using structures that already exist in any traditional&#13;
organizations that there may be (cf. Seibel and Massing 1974).&#13;
1.21      Care must be taken in determining the processes for extending credit.&#13;
The distribution of wealth is closely related to the distribution of power and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
reciprocal obligations in a community. Unless these aspects of the social&#13;
structure of target communities are investigated in advance, credit-systems&#13;
may be designed that will prove to be inadequate or potential problems may&#13;
fail to be anticipated. In some communities for example, attempts by agents&#13;
of change to introduce costly fishing technology in ways that might reduce&#13;
the chances that social stratification would be increased by going around&#13;
traditional owners of equipment and moneylenders have failed because fishermen&#13;
saw the traditional patron-client relationship as legitimate and the govern-&#13;
ment's planned intervention as illegitimate.   Emmerson (1975) describes a&#13;
development program in Indonesia in which a more complex, expensive technology&#13;
was to be introduced to native fishermen according to a plan wherein crewmen&#13;
would own the equipment collectively.   Traditionally, crewmen were bound to a&#13;
boat by an interest-free permanent "loan" provided by the boat owner. The&#13;
owner of the boat was bound to a moneylender by a similar arrangement.&#13;
According to Emmerson, the participants did not perceive the relationship&#13;
as exploitative--it was one of reciprocal obligations, freely engaged in, and&#13;
seen as being fair. When this traditional system was threatened by the intro-&#13;
duction of the new equipment, the fishermen destroyed the equipment and&#13;
assaulted a project administrator.&#13;
1.22      Other problems with the extension of credit can be related to the&#13;
fishermen's perception of the immediate source of the loan. In one fishery&#13;
development project in Malaysia, for example, the source of credit for the&#13;
fishermen was a government-sponsored cooperative. Many of the fishermen in&#13;
the region reasoned that since the function of the government is to help them,&#13;
the loans were like charity and did not have to be repaid (Narkswasdi 1967a).&#13;
As a result of the fishermen's perception of the government, neither the&#13;
loans nor the equipment provided were treated as a scarce resource, and the&#13;
project encountered serious difficulties.&#13;
1.23      It should be clear that this final decision point, determining&#13;
locally appropriate structures for extension of credit to fishermen, is as&#13;
important to the success of a project as all other decisions implied by&#13;
Figures 1-3. 1/ As will be seen below, several structures have been proposed,&#13;
but many developing countries have selected the cooperative as the ideal form&#13;
of organization. The fishermen's cooperative is therefore the subject of&#13;
this paper.&#13;
1/   Decisions other than to extend credit to fishermen could have been made&#13;
at this point. For example, the equipment could simply be donated to&#13;
the fishermen--an unlikely and unrealistic decision. A more likely&#13;
alternative decision would have been to establish a producer's&#13;
organization, such as a producer's cooperative, which would own the&#13;
equipment, which member fishermen would use, paying a share of the&#13;
catch to the organization for the use and upkeep of the equipment.&#13;
In this case credit would be extended only to the organization. The&#13;
organization would not extend credit to individual fishermen.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Sociocultural Information Needed&#13;
1.24      Figures 1-4 indicate that there are many decision points in the&#13;
development of a small-scale fishery that require the gathering of socio-&#13;
cultural data, particularly the identification of groups. If fishermen&#13;
in the target population appear to belong to distinctive linguistic,&#13;
religious, or ethnic groups, for example, it is necessary to map their&#13;
locations and determine degrees of intergroup tensions. Often, the&#13;
design of a project will be influenced by intergroup differences, and if&#13;
groups are identified during the early stages of planning, it will be&#13;
possible to make more realistic cost estimates (cf. Cochrane 1979).&#13;
1.25      After groups have been identified, the numbers and locations of&#13;
potential participants in a project within the target groups must be&#13;
analyzed. At this time it will also be possible to obtain information&#13;
concerning traditional channels of communication that will facilitate other&#13;
programs for the collection of data and enhance communication of proposed&#13;
changes to the target population (Cf. Pollnac and Sutinen 1980). Data&#13;
needed at this point include the level of development of target communities,&#13;
the occupational structure of the target region, the numbers of small-scale&#13;
fishermen, both employed and unemployed, the availability of alternative&#13;
occupations for fishermen, the temporal distribution of fishing effort,&#13;
along with reasons for the distribution of effort, and local knowledge of&#13;
fishing and fish.&#13;
1.26      If a decision   is made to keep the number of fishermen virtually&#13;
constant and to improve technological efficiency, then the needs for&#13;
information indicated by Figure 4 become essential. Basically, the data&#13;
needed include an analysis of the social structure of the occupation of&#13;
fishing and its place in the social structure of the community as a whole.&#13;
This includes types of fishing and patterns of ownership, size and social&#13;
composition of crew, criteria for selection of crews' the degree of occupa-&#13;
tional mobility, types of interaction among crew members and between owner&#13;
and crew, the degree of on-vessel and off-vessel occupational specialization,&#13;
the relations of fishing groups with other social groups in the society, and&#13;
the local distribution of wealth and power. 1/&#13;
1.27      Basic information concerning the introduction of innovations in the&#13;
past, their types, and their acceptance should also be gathered at this&#13;
time as a means of evaluating the potential for change as well as the most&#13;
effective paths for introducing it. Attitudes toward risk, change, and&#13;
investment can also be obtained at this stage of the project. These will be&#13;
important variables to be factored in the cost-benefit analysis of the&#13;
various technological alternatives.&#13;
1/   The word wealth, or desired goods, refers to different things in different&#13;
societies (cf. Cochrane 1979, Foster 1973). In some a wealthy man is one&#13;
with many children, in others, wealth is equated with the leisure time to&#13;
fulfill social obligations, while still in others, it is equated with the&#13;
possession of certain material things, such as gold, religious statues,&#13;
yams, and cattle.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
1.28      After cost-benefit analysis has selected the most appropriate&#13;
alternative technology, it will be important to assess the target group's&#13;
perceptions of the proposed changes. Often the new technology is only one of&#13;
many changes involved. For example, the costs of the technology necessitate&#13;
extending credit to the target group, through new financing structures such as&#13;
a cooperative where one did not serve that purpose before, then the credit&#13;
structure becomes part of the innovation that must be evaluated before it can&#13;
be introduced.&#13;
1.29      If the development alternative includes recruitment of new fishermen&#13;
to the occupation, attitudes of nonfishermen toward fishing should be assessed.&#13;
If assessment of skill levels suggests a need for training and if there is a&#13;
pool of people who wish to become fishermen, then a socioeconomic cost-benefit&#13;
analysis of alternative training techniques should be undertaken. This&#13;
analysis should include information concerning locally acceptable training&#13;
techniques for adults. It has been reported that extension efforts have&#13;
failed for reasons as trivial as inappropriate setting (Foster 1973). With&#13;
respect to this development alternative, both the new occupation and training&#13;
should be treated as innovations that require the types of information listed&#13;
below.&#13;
1.30      In the situation in which assessment of resources indicates a need&#13;
for management, information referred to earlier, such as alternative&#13;
occupations for fishermen and skill levels, will be useful in the decision-&#13;
making process. It will, however, be necessary to obtain information concern-&#13;
ing the attitudes of fishermen toward fishing as contrasted with potential&#13;
alternative occupations as well as attitudes towards changes in income.&#13;
Proposed management techniques-gear restrictions, seasons, and size limits&#13;
for example-must also be treated as innovations that make it necessary to&#13;
have the specific information listed below.&#13;
1.31      Turning to the need for information concerning the introduction of&#13;
innovations, the perceptions of the target group of the following attributes&#13;
of the innovations must be evaluated: complexity, compatibility, advantage,&#13;
trialability, and observability (cf. Rogers and Shoemaker 1971, Pollnac 1976).&#13;
Individual attributes associated with innovation should also be assessed at&#13;
this time as a means of identifying potential targets for a demonstration&#13;
effect within the target region.&#13;
1.32      Applied sociologists and anthropologists are best qualified to&#13;
collect, analyze, and make recommendatons on the basis of the types of data&#13;
listed above. Provided with a description of the proposed changes and the&#13;
size of the target population, an experienced field worker can estimate the&#13;
number of man-months that the collection and analysis of data will require.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
The costs will be modest in view of the fact that the return will be an&#13;
increased likelihood that a project will be successful. 1/&#13;
1.33      The remainder of this paper will be concerned with the fishermen's&#13;
cooperative, a structure that has been widely supported as a means for&#13;
developing small-scale fisheries. It should be noted that there is more&#13;
than one type of fishermen's cooperative. Some cooperative societies dis-&#13;
tribute fishing supplies at relatively low prices; some own or finance&#13;
ownership of the equipment used by the fishermen; others function only to&#13;
market fish; still others combine several or all of these functions. Further,&#13;
some fishermen's cooperative societies provide services such as savings and&#13;
social functions that are outside the realm of fishing. Different types are&#13;
required by different conditions in the fishery or the society involved, and&#13;
it is through research of the type advocated here that the appropriate type&#13;
of cooperative can be developed.&#13;
1.34      Finally, although the fishermen's cooperative will be treated here&#13;
as an innovation, it is important to understand that a cooperative is a&#13;
form of social organization the effectiveness of which depends on the behavior&#13;
of a large number of individuals. It is an innovation, therefore, that is&#13;
much more complex than a new net or motor, and it has social and political&#13;
implications that radiate far beyond the local group for which it is formed&#13;
(cf. Cernea 1975; Cernea and others 1971).&#13;
1/   A good example of the use of sociologists and anthropologists is the work&#13;
done by Susan Almy and Sylvia Maia for preparing a fishing project in&#13;
Brazil. On the basis of relatively brief field work they provided data,&#13;
correcting a one-sided and biased economic approach to the preparation of&#13;
this project. From these data significant recommendations could be made&#13;
as well as suggestions for further sociocultural investigations that&#13;
would increase the likelihood that a project would be successful&#13;
(Almy, 1981).&#13;

II. THE COOPERATIVE AS AN INSTITUTION FOR&#13;
PROMOTING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SMALL-SCALE FISHERMEN&#13;
2.1       Many governments, international organizations, and individuals see&#13;
the fishermen's cooperative as the ideal means of improving small-scale&#13;
fisheries. In some instances marked success has been reported (FAO 1971),&#13;
in others, failure (UNRISD 1975). Despite the fact that some of them fail,&#13;
attempts to set up cooperatives are understandable.&#13;
2.2       In the late 1950s and early 1960s the Food and Agriculture Organi-&#13;
zation of the United Nations (FAO) identified cooperative organizations as a&#13;
means of reducing inequities in development that were caused by an earlier&#13;
emphasis an wealthier and more efficient producers who were properly identi-&#13;
fied as having the greatest potential for making good use of new inputs and&#13;
techniques (Laidlaw 1962; Dulfer 1971). The cooperative, as well as other&#13;
farmer-s organizations, was seen as a means of overcoming the logistical&#13;
problems involved in the attempt to reach the large numbers of often illite-&#13;
rate farmers individually with both technical and financial assistance.&#13;
Consequently, the governing body of the FAO began to encourage the development&#13;
of cooperatives in various sectors (Dulfer 1971), including fisheries, as&#13;
can be seen from such publications as FAO 1971. Many FAO fishery projects&#13;
prepared in the 1960s and 1970s reflected this encouragement by making the&#13;
fishermen's cooperative the key institution in the development of the sma-1&#13;
scale fishery (see, for example, FAO/BID 1972, 1973 and projects for other&#13;
parts of Latin America and the developing world).&#13;
2.3       Nevertheless, things were not going well with the use of fisher-&#13;
men's cooperatives. In 1974 a fisheries expert who held the post of FAO&#13;
Regional Fisheries Officer in Latin America for ten years wrote that&#13;
cooperatives have failed so often and with such notoriety that there is wide-&#13;
spread skepticism among fishermen concerning their usefulness (Miyares del&#13;
Valle 1974).&#13;
2.4       It is not being suggested here that the FAO was ignorant of the&#13;
very real problems associated with the establishment of successful fishermen's&#13;
cooperatives. In early reports (FAO 1958), for example, difficulties were&#13;
noted and in 1975 many of the shortcomings of cooperatives were detailed&#13;
along with suggested causes (FAO 1975). Nevertheless, the report concluded&#13;
that "cooperatives appeared to offer the best means for assisting fishermen"&#13;
(FAO 1975:7).&#13;
2.5       By 1977, the accumulating weight of evidence against traditional&#13;
approaches to the establishment of fishermen's cooperatives began to have&#13;
some effect. In 1977 an FAO report offered the conclusion that classical&#13;
European cooperative systems will fail in small-scale fisheries in develop-&#13;
ing countries unless they are adapted to local realities, and that a minimum&#13;
of five to ten years' preparation is needed (FAO 1977). Sometime around&#13;
1977 a new concept for small-scale fisheries development that included an&#13;
optional cooperative element was also being developed (c.f. Ben-Yami 1980).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
This was the concept of the development of community fishery centers that&#13;
did not insist on ready-made solutions such as the cooperative, but stressed&#13;
that solutions must be appropriate to the environment. As long as all sectors&#13;
of the fishery and their infrastructure--harvesting, processing, marketing,&#13;
supplies, and so on--were given adequate consideration the various sectors&#13;
could manifest any combination of appropriate patterns of ownership--private&#13;
enterprise, cooperative, government enterprise, or community enterprise. Gone&#13;
was the stress on the cooperative. Related to the concept of the community&#13;
fishing center is that of grass-roots groups and associations of both small-&#13;
farmers and fishermen. Proponents of this concept make little mention of&#13;
cooperatives but emphasize the formation of small groups with many of the same&#13;
functions as cooperatives, such as group planning, mutual aid, group action&#13;
for credit and marketing, group self-study, and group bargaining for social&#13;
justice (FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Far East 1978). It appears to&#13;
be a means of avoiding both the stigma of the term "cooperative" and the rigid&#13;
rules and regulations that often suiround cooperatives in the developing&#13;
world. Attempts at developing these organizations are relatively recent, and&#13;
no verifiable results have been reported yet; thus we cannot make any estimates&#13;
of the time or problems involved.&#13;
2.6       Although emphasis so far has been on the place of fishermen's&#13;
cooperatives in FAO development projects, it should be noted that in the&#13;
international aid programs for fisheries in many countries the cooperative&#13;
is used to one degree or another. Other international organizations also&#13;
support cooperatives. The First Open World conference on Cooperative&#13;
Fisheries, for example, concluded that "cooperatives were the best suited&#13;
agencies for fishery development" and that "aid to fishermen should be&#13;
channelled through cooperative organizations" (Davies and Sakamoto 1975:&#13;
82-84). The World Bank has also noted,&#13;
Local institutions, such as farmers' associations&#13;
and cooperatives, have obvious potential advantages for&#13;
coping with administrative difficulties in reaching the&#13;
rural poor. On the one side, they provide some measure&#13;
of participation through the involvement of their members.&#13;
On the other, they perform intermediary functions which&#13;
make it possible to provide credit to larger numbers&#13;
than can be done through official agencies. Group&#13;
members can be held jointly responsible for repayment of&#13;
credit and for acceptance of input supplies or other&#13;
produce (World Bank 1975: 37).&#13;
The Bank goes on to note that almost 20 percent of its farm credit is dis-&#13;
bursed through this kind of organization. Table 1 shows that fishery&#13;
cooperatives figure in 57 percent of the Bank-assisted recent fishery projects.&#13;
2.7       The extent of the use of fishermen's cooperatives in World Bank-&#13;
assisted fishery projects has varied considerably through the years. The&#13;
paucity and limited geographical distribution of projects that strictly concern&#13;
fisheries makes it impossible to discern trends, but a project-by-project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
examination of projected use of fishermen's cooperatives as reflected in a&#13;
set of staff appraisal reports of the last few years should clarify their&#13;
relative importance.&#13;
2.8       Of the two fishery projects appraised in 1980 and reviewed for&#13;
this paper, the Kenya project indicates extensive reliance on fishermen's&#13;
cooperatives. Eleven fishermen's cooperatives will participate in the&#13;
project and will be the direct obligors and ultimate borrowers of more&#13;
than 90 percent of Project credit funds. The appraisal report notes that&#13;
while some of the marine cooperatives have been relatively successful, many&#13;
of the inland cooperatives manifest signs of financial weakness such as&#13;
losses on loans and lack of services. The potential failure of cooperatives&#13;
to manage the fishing centers effectively is seen as the primary risk of the&#13;

project; substantial support and guidance of management was therefore written&#13;
into the project. But as the authors of the report note, risk of failure is&#13;
likely to be mitigated if the cooperatives receive the support and confidence&#13;
of most fishermen in the areas they are serving. As will be seen, such con-&#13;
fidence and support is related to a host of sociocultural variables that were&#13;
not addressed in the report.&#13;
2.9       Of the six 1979 fishery project appraisal reports examined, four&#13;
mention the use or possible use of fishermen's cooperatives. Development of&#13;
fisheries with the use of fishermen's cooperative organizations is government&#13;
policy in the Peoples Democratic Republic of Yemen. These cooperatives are&#13;
assisted by a Cooperative Department within the Ministry of Fish Wealth. It&#13;
is reported that approximately 50 percent of the fishermen belong to coopera-&#13;
tives. The PDR Yemen Second Fishery Project will provide credit to coopera-&#13;
tives for the purchase of vessels, engines, and gear.&#13;
2.10      In the Second Fishery Project for Tunisia the potential use of&#13;
fishermen's cooperatives is noted. The Fisheries Authority, which is to be&#13;
created as a semiautonomous public agency, is to take significant part in&#13;
project activities, among which are promoting the formation of fishermen-s&#13;
cooperatives or similar professional organizations and supervising their&#13;
activities. The report also notes that fishermen's cooperatives may&#13;
eventually guarantee mortages of new boats, a function to be performed at&#13;
the early stages of the project by the Banque Nationale de Tunise. Con-&#13;
struction of new port sites is seen as an opportunity to reorganize fisher-&#13;
men into cooperatives or other organizations that could eventually take&#13;
over the leases of shore facilities.&#13;
2.11      The potential for eventual use of cooperatives in the Bangladesh&#13;
Oxbow Lakes Fishery Project is substantial. First, the project will bring&#13;
into being a source of fish fry and fingerlings that will eventually be&#13;
used throughout the country. Whether this new resource is used effectively&#13;
depends largely on the success of the fishery cooperatives that are organized&#13;
by the Integrated Rural Development Program and given exclusive right to&#13;
manage and harvest village ponds. Second, project monitoring and evaluation&#13;
studies are to explore the feasibility of using cooperatives and other&#13;
institutions for management of future projects.&#13;
2.12      Finally for 1979, as noted in the staff report on the Indian Inland&#13;
Fisheries Project, Fish Farmer Development Agencies funded by the government&#13;
of India help arrange fish pond leases between government bodies and private&#13;
individuals or cooperatives. Project credit for fish ponds will go through&#13;
participating banks refinanced by the Agricultural Refinance and Development&#13;
Corporation to individual fish farmers, groups, or cooperatives. Thus coopera-&#13;
tives have a potential place in the project, but their nature is unspecified.&#13;
2.13      The project in Andhra Pradesh, India, was the only fishery project&#13;
appraised for 1978. The principal objectives of this project included improve-&#13;
ment of three harbors, access roads, and seafood plants and provision of&#13;
credit for fishing vessels to be owned and operated by individuals, com-&#13;
panies, and cooperatives. Approximately half the vessels were to be financed&#13;
through cooperatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
2.14      Of the two fishery projects appraised for 1977 only the Gujarat,&#13;
India, project mentioned the use of fishermen's cooperatives. In this&#13;
project the Fishermen's Primary Cooperative Society (FPCS) is expected&#13;
to operate the hire-purchase scheme through which canoes and outboard motors&#13;
will be provided to fishermen. The Gujarat Fisheries Central Cooperative&#13;
Association Ltd., which includes some sixty FPCSs, seven of which are defunct,&#13;
will be responsible under the project for constructing fishing vessels and&#13;
importing outboard motors. It will receive trucks to serve the fishing&#13;
villages and two net-making machines. The fishermen's cooperative thus has&#13;
important functions to perform in this project.&#13;
2.15      Only one of the three reports on fishery projects for 1976 mentioned&#13;
the use of cooperatives. The Tanzanian Fisheries Development Project has as&#13;
one of its objectives the establishment of pilot ujamaa fisheries programs&#13;
on Lake Tanganyika that will absorb approximately 17 percent of the total&#13;
cost of the project.&#13;
2.16      Table 1 and the brief summaries just presented should convince the&#13;
reader that the fishermen's cooperative is a project variable of at least&#13;
some significance in World Bank-assisted fisheries projects and in the projects&#13;
of other development agencies as well. Often development agencies have little&#13;
choice but to use a cooperative. Nearly all the governments in the developing&#13;
world support cooperative development in one form or another for rural areas&#13;
(World Bank 1975) and have cooperative departments or ministries and training&#13;
facilities which encourage their use. In a recent survey of Western Africa,&#13;
for example, it was found that of the six countries visited five have&#13;
established policy to encourage the formation of fishermen's cooperatives.&#13;
The sixth is proceeding cautiously because of past failures (Lamming and Hotta&#13;
1980). This type of emphasis on fishermen's cooperatives clearly indicates&#13;
that, despite failures in the past, aid agencies such as the World Bank will&#13;
be in the position of having to make important decisions concerning the use of&#13;
fishermen's cooperatives in development schemes. Such decisions must be made&#13;
on the basis of adequate information, and the remainder of this paper will be&#13;
concerned with the available information and with procedures for obtaining&#13;
additional project-specific information concerning the use of fishermen's&#13;
cooperatives.&#13;

III. CULTURAL DIFFICULTIES IN DEVELOPING FISHERMEN-S COOPERATIVES&#13;
3.1       Most experienced field workers involved with development projects&#13;
realize that sociocultural variables are among the important determinants&#13;
of the success or failure of a project (cf. Zaltman and Duncan 1977). The&#13;
relative importance of these variables was made clear in a study of thirty-&#13;
six rural-development projects which indicated that sociocultural variables&#13;
were strongly related to the success of a project (Morss and others 1976).&#13;
Social scientists have been investigating the sociocultural antecedents and&#13;
consequences of development and change for a number of years. Rogers and&#13;
Agarwala-Rogers (1976) note that some 2,700 published studies deal with&#13;
the subject. Some of these studies have succeeded in accounting for more&#13;
than 80 percent of the variance in innovative behavior (Moulik and others&#13;
1966, Wish 1967 for example). Despite this apparent mountain of informa-&#13;
tion numerous development programs are delayed and sometimes fail because&#13;
of sociocultural factors. The reason may be that some development-assistance&#13;
agencies have reservations concerning the value of social research (Cochrane&#13;
1974) and thus provide only token support. It is thus important to clearly&#13;
outline the sociocultural context of the establishment of fishermen's coopera-&#13;
tives as a means of emphasizing the importance of these variables to the&#13;
success or failure of the cooperatives. The purpose of this section of the&#13;
paper is to focus attention on these sociocultural variables. The variables&#13;
considered will be examined systematically so that sociocultural impediments&#13;
to specific programs for the development of fishermen's cooperatives can be&#13;
anticipated and solutions proposed.&#13;
1. Conceptualizing the Cooperative as an Innovation&#13;
3.2       The concept of "innovation" as it is used here refers to "an idea,&#13;
practice, or object perceived as new by the relevant unit of adoption" (Rogers&#13;
and Agarwala-Rogers 1976: 150) thus, a fishermen's cooperative can be treated&#13;
as an innovation. The relevant unit of adoption is referred to as the target&#13;
group. As noted earlier, however, it is 1,mportant to remember that a coopera-&#13;
tive is a form of social organization--an innovation of a different order&#13;
from that of a new net or motor. With respect to most discussions of innova-&#13;
tions the adopting unit is the individual. A cooperative, however, depends&#13;
on the behavior of a collective of individuals to make it effective; thus,&#13;
the adopting unit is a group rather than an individual (cf. Cernea 1975;&#13;
Cernea and others 1971). Individuals or family units, make decisions to join&#13;
or not join, but the ultimate success of a cooperative depends on its ability&#13;
to attract, organize and mobilize for action a critical mass of units that&#13;
will conform to its social and economic objectives (Cernea 1975). One&#13;
individual can adopt a monofilament gill net, but it takes much more than one&#13;
to adopt and maintain a cooperative; thus, the following discussion is much&#13;
more complex than it would be if the subject were diffusion of gill nets.&#13;
3.3       Most social scientists agree that an effective prograNm of innovation&#13;
transfer consists of a number of essential and interrelated ingredients:&#13;
development of an innovation that is compatible with the target environment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
and economy; communication of the new idea to the target population; recogni-&#13;
tion by the target group that the new idea will fulfill a perceived need and&#13;
will be, or can be, made consonant with their beliefs, values, attitudes, and&#13;
status and role relationships. These three key ingredients form the first&#13;
stages in the transfer of an innovation as depicted in figure 5. 1/&#13;
3.4       Figure 5 illustrates the factors that influence the transfer of&#13;
innovations. The feedback loops in the model indicate the dynamic nature&#13;
of the process of transfer of innovation. 2/ Consideration of one very&#13;
important aspect of the model reveals that attributes of the innovation (cf.&#13;
Rogers and Shoemaker 1971) are entered under several stages of the transfer&#13;
process. These multiple entries indicate the dynamic multicomponential nature&#13;
of an innovation. The attributes indicate the categories of meaning attached&#13;
to an innovation, and their multiple entries reflect the fact that this&#13;
meaning has the potential of changing as the innovation becomes known,&#13;
tested, and adopted or rejected (Pollnac 1973). These various aspects of&#13;
the meaning of an innovation and their systemic effects will be examined&#13;
subsequently as each stage of the transfer of the complex known as a fishery&#13;
cooperative is examined.&#13;
3.5       Before discussing the various stages of the transfer of fishery-&#13;
cooperative organization, it should be noted that the model presented in&#13;
Figure 5, unless it is properly considered, oversimplifies the complex&#13;
processes involved. As will be seen, each stage is composed of interlocking&#13;
subsystems, each of which has an important function in either facilitating&#13;
or impeding the transfer of innovations.&#13;
3.6       Assuming that a fishermen's cooperative is the appropriate choice&#13;
or is one mandated by the government, the first stage in the development&#13;
process is to establish a preliminary charter for the cooperative in which the&#13;
proposed scope and standard operating procedure should be outlined and a&#13;
constitution included. The scope involves a decision whether it will be&#13;
a credit, production, marketing, or multipurpose cooperative. This decision&#13;
will depend upon the needs of the project. The constitution involves estab-&#13;
lishment of rules for management and decisionmaking. Many of the developing&#13;
countries that encourage the formation of cooperatives already have official&#13;
by-laws for cooperatives that must be followed if the organization is to&#13;
be officially recognized (FAO 1971). The FAO (1971) has prepared a manual&#13;
providing a brief description of the structure of fishermen's cooperatives&#13;
that may be of use at this stage.&#13;
1/   Pollnac (1976, 1978a, 1978b) has used variants of this model in several&#13;
other contexts. This general applicability is one of its strengths.&#13;
2/   The feedback loops, especially feedback from perception by the target&#13;
group, through reformulation, development, and contact, is related to&#13;
the "process approach" to development and "adaptive research" (Mickelwait&#13;
and others 1979). Recent literature suggests that this approach to&#13;
development, although time-consuming, is the most effective approach.&#13;

3.7       One of the unfortunate facts concerning the development of pre-&#13;
liminary guidelines for a fishermen's cooperative is the constraint pre-&#13;
sented by government regulations. Government guidelines for cooperatives are&#13;
often based on the European model, which in many respects is not adaptable to&#13;
the situation in developing countries (Munker 1976). Sometimes existing&#13;
regulations concerning cooperatives discriminate against the poor and permit&#13;
preemption of benefits by the local rich (Yudelman 1979). In situations such&#13;
as these, the Bank may be justified in using its leverage to persuade the&#13;
government to redefine its laws governing cooperatives.&#13;
3.8       In establishing a preliminary charter for a fishermen's cooperative&#13;
it is important to pay attention to the projected attributes of the form of&#13;
organization developed. These are the attributes predicted for the cooperative&#13;
because of the nature of the target group. The accuracy of these predictions&#13;
depends largely on knowledge of the target group. It must be determined, for&#13;
example, whether the cooperative organization is too complex for the target&#13;
group: What levels of training are necessary to operate it? Are there&#13;
sufficient numbers of qualified individuals among the target group? The&#13;
compatibility of the cooperative must be projected, and this is no simple&#13;
matter, since it is a multivariate compatibility that is in question. Is it&#13;
compatible with the environment-that is, will it exploit the resources&#13;
improperly? Is it compatible with the social system? Will it produce&#13;
greater social stratification and unequal distribution of wealth, thereby in-&#13;
creasing the likelihood of social unrest? Will it break up traditional work&#13;
groups that were key elements of social control? Will it change the tradi-&#13;
tional distribution of items associated with prestige and power? Will the&#13;
new tasks required be compatible with the psychological make-up of the in-&#13;
dividuals involved within the target group? In determining this, it must be&#13;
determined whether quantity is more important than quality, whether leisure&#13;
time is more important than either quality or quantity, and so on. The&#13;
agent of change must also assess the trialability of the cooperative-can&#13;
the cooperative be effectively used by all concerned members of the target&#13;
group or will only the richest benefit? Finally, very important with regard&#13;
to the meaning of an innovation is its observability. Can the results of&#13;
its application be readily observed, and if not, how can the target group be&#13;
convinced of its efficacy? These and many other questions concerning the&#13;
meaning of an innovation will be examined in detail in relation to other&#13;
stages of the transfer of the organization of fishermen's cooperatives.&#13;
3.9       At this point, however, it should be stressed that the more similar&#13;
the attributes at the development stage are to those at the perception,&#13;
trial, adoption, and institution stages, the more likely it is that the&#13;
transfer process will be successful. The probablility of achieving this&#13;
goal can be enhanced by prior acquisition of relevant socioeconomic, cultural,&#13;
and environmental data and, most important, proper communication of the multi-&#13;
componential meaning of the proposed fishermen's cooperative to the target&#13;
group at the contact stage. Communication is one of the key ingredients in&#13;
the transfer of innovations that will be examined in the next section.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
3.10      Contact.  It is obvious that no innovation can be transferred with-&#13;
out the target group s first being made aware of its existence. Knowledge of&#13;
the innovation must be communicated, and many aspects of the communication&#13;
process affect its evaluation and acceptance by the target group. As one of&#13;
the first critical stages of the transfer of cooperative organizations, the&#13;
communication process deserves careful attention.&#13;
3.11      The communication event entails several important components (Hymes&#13;
1964a): the participants-senders, receivers, interpreters, spokesmen, and so&#13;
on; the channels-speeches, newspapers, pamphlets, radio, television, wall&#13;
posters, and so on; the codes--the language (national, local dialect) the&#13;
combination of language and pictures; the setting-formal meeting, school-&#13;
room, the beach; the form of the message--salesman's pitch, sermon, informal&#13;
chat; and finally the topic--here information concerning attributes of the&#13;
innovation. It is important to note that these components of a communication&#13;
event form an interrelated whole--a system. The topic may define certain&#13;
characteristics of senders and receivers. The agent of change, for example,&#13;
should be of the same sex as the target group for the diffusion of information&#13;
concerning birth control in many societies. Relative social status and&#13;
familiarity of sender and receiver dictate the form and code of the message in&#13;
many cultures. Familiar message forms or codes may be taken as insulting when&#13;
used by strangers. Characteristics of the receiver may also dictate the&#13;
channel and the code. It is obvious that written messages or the national&#13;
language cannot be used with people who have only a rudimentary grasp of&#13;
reading or the national tongue. The intricacies of these interrelations&#13;
suggest that sensitivity to the structure of communication events within the&#13;
target group, either through extensive exposure or with the use of a good&#13;
local assistant, is necessary. An examination of the interaction between the&#13;
components of communicative events and the transfer of innovations can be&#13;
found in Pollnac (1976) and Pollnac and Sutinen (1980). The target group's&#13;
perception of the cooperative is strongly influenced by the attributes of the&#13;
contact stage.&#13;
3.12      Perceptions of fishermen's cooperatives by the target group are&#13;
perhaps the most difficult and least tangible variables to be considered in&#13;
the transfer of cooperative organizations. Nevertheless, they are among the&#13;
most important. The aim at the communication stage is to influence these&#13;
perceptions in such a way as to bring about either trial and subsequent&#13;
adoption or rejection of the cooperative. Foster (1973) has written&#13;
When people are confronted with new opportunities,&#13;
acceptance or rejection depends not only upon the&#13;
basic cultural articulation, a favorable pattern&#13;
of social relations, and economic possiblity, but&#13;
also upon psychological factors. How does the&#13;
novelty appear to the individual? That is how&#13;
does he perceive it? Does he see it in the same&#13;
light as the technical specialist who presents it&#13;
to him? Does it convey the same message? Since&#13;
perception is largely determined by culture,&#13;
people of different cultures often perceive the&#13;
same phenomenon in different ways (p.130).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
Furthermore, Rogers and Shoemaker (1971) cite numerous empirical studies&#13;
indicating a relationship between the perception of the attributes of an&#13;
innovation listed in our model (Figure 5) and its rate of adoption. Kivlin&#13;
and Fliegel (1967) note that perception of innovations accounts for more&#13;
than 50 percent of the variance in adoption rate.&#13;
3.13      As can be seen in Figure 5, there is feedback from contact to&#13;
perception to reformulation. It is essential to monitor the perception&#13;
of innovations continuously and sensitively. This type of feedback can&#13;
make possible reformulation of either the communication or the innovation&#13;
and prevent its untimely rejection. As Mickelwait and others (1979) note,&#13;
this type of feedback, which produces evolutionary project development or&#13;
"adaptive research," is quite time-consuming and meets with resistance from&#13;
agencies and governments who want to proceed with development as rapidly as&#13;
possible. The absence of proven guidelines for cooperative development, as&#13;
demonstrated by their excessive rate of failure and the logic of adaptive&#13;
research for developing such guidelines should be sufficient justification&#13;
for using an adaptive research approach. As Lele has noted "it is counter-&#13;
productive to push cooperative development too rapidly as it usually&#13;
backfires, frequently making cooperatives the haven of government subsidies&#13;
and a barometer of inefficiency." (Lele: 17-18).&#13;
3.14      Many different variables influence the perception of a fishermen-s&#13;
cooperative. The communication of the innovation as discussed above is one.&#13;
Other variables can be classified as individual, social, or cultural.&#13;
Indentification of these variables can be a complex problem, but if it is&#13;
agreed that favorable perception of an innovation is accompanied by early&#13;
adoption, it is possible to begin with the thirty individual characteristics&#13;
associated with early adoption derived by Rogers and Shoemaker (1971) from a&#13;
massive review of the literature. These thirty characteristics can be found&#13;
in Table 2. The categories used are those presented by Rogers and Shoemaker&#13;
(1971: 174-196) except thar the socioeconomic characteristics are separated&#13;
into individual and entrepreneurial characteristics.&#13;
3.15      The figures in parentheses following each variable in Table 2&#13;
indicate the direction of the relation the numbers of empirical studies re-&#13;
viewed, and the percentage of studies that support the relation. Education,&#13;
for example, is related positively to early adoption, and 74 percent of the&#13;
275 studies in which the relation between these two variables is tested&#13;
support the generalization. Most of the generalizations are supported by&#13;
about 60-70 percent of the studies; only two are supported by 10 percent.&#13;
In addition most of the studies are statistical in nature; some studies, for&#13;
example, present findings to indicate that given an individual with quality x,&#13;
there is a strong likelihood (with a stated probability) that he will be an&#13;

early adopter, or given a group of individuals with quality x, there will&#13;
be more early innovators than would be expected on the basis of chance&#13;
alone. Because of the nature of these relations it is often necessary to&#13;
take more than one variable into account at a time as a means of increasing&#13;
the probability of predicting early adoption. Chattopadhyay and Pareek&#13;
(1967) interrelated five psychological variables with innovation adoption&#13;
behavior in India-fatalism, conservatism, authoritarianism, proneness to&#13;
change, and level of aspiration. Individually these variables account for&#13;
between 24 and 40 percent of the variance in innovative behavior. A multiple&#13;
regression analysis, however, indicated that fatalism, conservatism, and&#13;
authoritarianism together account for 59 percent of the variance, the other&#13;
two adding insignificantly to the total. It is therefore essential that&#13;
the individual attributes associated with the perception of innovations be&#13;
examined as bundles of attributes and that no single indicator be relied&#13;
on. As indicated earlier, reliance on single indicators decreases the prob-&#13;
ability of accurate prediction.&#13;
3.16      Although individual differences are important to an understanding&#13;
of variability in the innovative process, it is important to realize that the&#13;
sociocultural context is significant in determination of the distribution of&#13;
many of the characteristics listed in Table 2. Among the individual charac-&#13;
teristics in Table 2, for example, education and literacy depend, in large&#13;
part, upon the structure of educational opportunity in the matrix society.&#13;
Social status, upward mobility, and variance in the size of the productive&#13;
unit are interrelated and more likely to be manifested in communities with&#13;
a fair amount of socioeconomic differentiation than in generally homogeneous&#13;
peasant farming villages. This interpretation is supported by Stanfield and&#13;
Whiting (1972) who note that although social status and wealth are related&#13;
to innovativeness .regardless of community type, "farmers in communities with&#13;
less landownership concentration are somewhat more prone to innovate"&#13;
(p. 401). Turning to other characteristics listed in Table 2, a commercial&#13;
orientation and a favorable attitude toward credit are rare in a subsistence&#13;
economy but relatively common in market economies, while specialized opera-&#13;
tions occur more frequently in market systems.&#13;
3.17      The personality characteristics can also be understood as reflections&#13;
of the sociocultural matrix. Empathy, dogmatism, the ability to deal with&#13;
abstractions, rationality, intelligence (as commonly measured), fatalism, and&#13;
favorable attitudes toward change, education, and science are all obviously&#13;
related to various sociocultural variables. The existence of a modern educa-&#13;
tional system, for example, functions to acquaint individuals with new ideas&#13;
and other peoples, thus fostering a degree of empathy and reducing dogmatism.&#13;
A good educational system also increases the ability to deal with abstrac-&#13;
tions and problems in what is generally referred to as a rational manner. An&#13;
individual from a traditional village, in most respects isolated from the&#13;
outside world, has little basis for empathy with an agent of change or a&#13;
government official. His behavior, which outsiders may view as dogmatic,&#13;
may be the only effective-and therefore rational-means he has of dealing with&#13;
a specific problem, and his subsistence status allows for little error.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
3.18      Favorable attitudes toward change, education, and science are&#13;
fostered in systems in which change is taking place and the fruits of educa-&#13;
tion and science can be seen. Fatalism is often common in situations in&#13;
which the individual perceives that he has little control over natural and&#13;
social conditions; as this control increases, the degree of fatalism decreases&#13;
(Foster 1973). In addition, Edgerton (1971) notes that among East African&#13;
pastoralists and farmers, fatalism is related to crowding in residence--&#13;
another sociocultural variable. Favorable attitudes toward risk are found&#13;
in sociocultural contexts where the future is reasonably secure (cf. Parsons&#13;
1971, Thompson 1975, Pollnac and Poggie 1978b). Individuals in unpredictable&#13;
sociocultural environments, living on the margins of existence, can afford&#13;
little risk-the slightest problems can result in failure and starvation.&#13;
Achievement motivation is a complex, difficult to measure variable (cf.&#13;
Sutcliffe 1974), which is closely related to level of aspiration.   Both&#13;
variables have been related to traditional cultural institutions.   The extreme&#13;
importance of this variable has been indicated by Felt (1971), who suggests&#13;
that it mediates between education, literacy, exposure to the mass media and&#13;
innovative behavior (also see Rogers 1969).&#13;
3.19      Among the communication variables, cosmopolitanism and exposure to&#13;
mass media depend on the transportation network and the channels of communica-&#13;
tion of the matrix society-what Frey (1971) refers to as the "developmental&#13;
climate."   Knowledge of an innovation and the search for information about&#13;
it are related to exposure to it through travel (cosmopolitness), the mass&#13;
media or contact with an agent of change. All three of these variables,&#13;
once again, are dependent on networks of communication and transportation.&#13;
3.20      In sum, it can be seen that several socio-cultural variables are&#13;
associated with the individual characteristics that are related to perceptions&#13;
of an innovation. Most important among these are the system of social&#13;
stratification, the structure of educational opportunity, the degree of socio-&#13;
cultural stability, the degree of market orientation over subsistence&#13;
orientation, and the extent of the networks of communication and transporta-&#13;
tion. Some of these variables, along with several others, directly affect&#13;
perception of the attributes of innovations. In the following sections the&#13;
effects of some of these same individual and sociocultural variables on the&#13;
perception of fishermen's cooperatives will be demonstrated.&#13;
3.21      The complexity of a fishermen's cooperative does not seem to be a&#13;
salient variable at the perception stage. My own experience suggests that&#13;
the real complexity of a cooperative organization is not realized until the&#13;
trial stage. This is probably the result of the top-down, paternalistic&#13;
approach used in establishing cooperatives, where the emphasis is on obtain-&#13;
ing members through promises of benefits rather than on educating the fish-&#13;
ermen to the fact that they will be involved in running a complex organization.&#13;
3.22      There is also surprisingly little in the literature concerning the&#13;
compatibility of fishermen's cooperatives at the perception stage. This is&#13;
probably due to the fact that most studies have been concerned with members&#13;
of cooperatives that either have failed or are in the process of failing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
To determine fishermen-s perception of cooperatives before they have been&#13;
tried or rejected it is necessary to conduct interviews soon after the idea&#13;
has been presented. Examples of this kind of research can be found in&#13;
Pollnac (1977), Pollnac and Carmo (1980), and Poggie (1979, 1980). These&#13;
studies will be discussed in detail later. At this point it is enough to&#13;
note that although some agreement concerning the meaning of fishermen's&#13;
cooperatives was found among small-scale fishermen, there was also consider-&#13;
able variation in fishermen's knowledge of this type of organization and&#13;
its benefits and functions. Unless this variation in beliefs is known, and&#13;
programs, such as cooperative training sessions with feedback from fishermen,&#13;
are established to deal with it, it could lead to problems in instituting&#13;
and maintaining fishermen's cooperatives because of varying expectations&#13;
on the part of the fishermen.&#13;
3.23      With respect to perceived advantage several lessons can be learned&#13;
from past projects. First, advantage is relative-what may be advantageous&#13;
to one sector of the target group may be disadvantageous to another. In&#13;
Tanzania, for example, middlemen who would have been hurt by the establishment&#13;
of cooperatives on Lake Tanganyika schemed against their formation (Dibbs&#13;
1964). My experience has been that the less efficient fishermen are more apt&#13;
to perceive some advantage to belonging to a cooperative while successful&#13;
fishermen feel that they will have to share their profits with those who are&#13;
less able and they therefore reject membership. Lele (1978, n.d.) makes&#13;
similar points concerning farmers's cooperatives. Another example can be&#13;
found in Sierra Leone, where Ghanaian fishermen opposed the formation of&#13;
fishermen's cooperatives because they felt that cooperatives would give the&#13;
advantage to Sierra Leonean fishermen (Laming and Hotta 1980). Perceived&#13;
advantage also works in favor of the establishment of fishermen's cooperatives.&#13;
In Japan the cooperatives have the exclusive right to exploit coastal waters&#13;
(Hamlisch and Hotta 1978). Such laws can function to support cooperatives,&#13;
but if they are not accompanied by an effective program of cooperative&#13;
development they can lead to disaster. In 1964 the Malaysian government&#13;
directed that trawler licenses would only be given to members of cooperatives.&#13;
Fishing cooperatives grew in number but their problems soon made it obvious&#13;
that the wish to obtain a license rather than belief in the ideology of the&#13;
cooperative movement was the motive for joining (Fisheries Development&#13;
Authority, Malaysia, 1980).&#13;
3.24      The trialability of fishermen's cooperatives can stop a fisherman&#13;
from becoming a member even if his other perceptions of the organization are&#13;
favorable. First, since many of the target fishermen are quite poor, any&#13;
additional expenditure of money or time may be too high a price to pay.&#13;
Second, the perceived cost of risk must be considered (Mickelwait and others&#13;
1979). If the poor fisherman believes there is any chance that his production&#13;
will fail because of membership in a cooperative, he will not join, because he&#13;
perceives his entire livelihood as being in jeopardy. Third, several authors&#13;
have suggested that fishermen's indebtedness to middlemen prevents their&#13;
shifting to a cooperative (Miyares del Valle 1974). In some cases this&#13;
obstacle to trialability has been removed by refinancing these debts (Hamlisch&#13;
and Hota 1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
3.25      Finally, with respect to observability the suggestion that fishermen&#13;
must be persuaded of long-term benefits is encountered. Such statements&#13;
clearly indicate that the benefits of fishermen's cooperatives are not clearly&#13;
observable at the beginning. As Miyares del Valle (1974) has written "a few&#13;
centavos more for each fish or a few pesos less per ton of ice will be more&#13;
powerful arguments than the knowledge gained from months of prior training and&#13;
education.'&#13;
3.26      As the model indicates, the perception stage can be followed by&#13;
either trial or rejection. Additionally, if perceptions are sampled by the&#13;
agent of change, perceived incompatibilities can be reduced either by offering&#13;
new instructional messages or by redesigning the cooperative. Nevertheless,&#13;
many of the sociocultural and individual incompatibilities do not appear&#13;
until the trial stage or later. This makes it necessary to alter the&#13;
percieved attributes of the cooperative at these later stages.&#13;
3.27      The trial stage is the stage at which many of the real, short-term&#13;
attributes of a fishermen's cooperative are discerned by the target group. At&#13;
the trial stage the fishermen determine whether the cooperative is in fact too&#13;
complex to operate efficiently, whether its operations are compatible, at&#13;
least in the short run, with the social and economic environment, whether its&#13;
advantages are observable, and, whether they can-in fact afford to give it a&#13;
trial. Many of the same sociocultural and individual constraints that were&#13;
discussed at the perception stage must now be tested for short-term compati-&#13;
bility. Short-term compatibility is stressed, since the trial stage is often&#13;
short and sociocultural dysfunctions often take some time to develop. If&#13;
perceptions of the cooperative degenerate during the trial stage and lead to&#13;
its rejection, the failure may affect future receptiveness to fishermen's&#13;
cooperatives (Miyares del Valle 1974, Pollnac 1977, Ho Toh 1980).&#13;
3.28      The adoption stage is reached when a substantial number of the&#13;
fishermen join the cooperative. At this stage its sociocultural, political,&#13;
and individual compatibilities are severely tested. Problems at this stage&#13;
can still lead to negative perceptions and rejection.&#13;
3.29      It is at the adoption stage that the complexity of running a fisher-&#13;
men's cooperative comes to the surface. This is true with respect to all&#13;
types of cooperatives-supply, credit, production, marketing, and multipurpose.&#13;
A cooperative is not an easy organization to run, and reports are filled with&#13;
failures attributed primarily to poor managment (Narkswasdi 1967a; Gerhardsen&#13;
1977; FAO 1975; Castillo-Obispo 1980). Further it has been noted that&#13;
effective participation by fishermen requires a certain level of skills&#13;
(Gerhardsen 1977; Narkawasdi 1967a). Lele (n.d.) has made similar observa-&#13;
tions concerning agricultural cooperatives.&#13;
3.30      After substantial numbers of fishermen have been using the coopera-&#13;
tive organization for several months, the compatibility of certain aspects of&#13;
its structure and operating procedures with various aspects of the fishery&#13;
become more thoroughly tested. For example, certain procedures established&#13;
for the cooperative may be incompatible with traditional work patterns of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
local fishermen. If the composition of a crew changes frequently it would&#13;
not make sense to establish a hire-purchase scheme directed toward joint&#13;
ownership by an entire crew. The Kuala Linggi Fishermen's Cooperative&#13;
Credit and Marketing Society in Malaysia had crew members jointly sign a&#13;
hire-purchase contract for their fishing vessel. Quarrels led to changes in&#13;
crew, and the settlement of loans was thereby vastly complicated. Further,&#13;
concerning traditional work patterns, in many small-scale fishing communities&#13;
the fishing families obtain some of their food and income from raising animals&#13;
or crops. If this practice is not taken into account in cooperative schemes&#13;
that involve relocation of fishermen, problems may develop. The Kuala Linggi&#13;
Fishermen's Cooperative, for example, provided low-rent housing for its&#13;
fishermen, but the houses were located on low land that flooded at high tide,&#13;
making it useless for crops or livestock. It turned out that total income from&#13;
fishing alone was insufficient, and both payment of rent and repayment of&#13;
loans were affected (Narkswasdi 1967a).&#13;
3.31      Cooperative regulations must also be compatible with fishermen's&#13;
residence patterns. Some fishermen migrate from place to place to maximize&#13;
their catch. One of the criteria for membership in a cooperative in West&#13;
Bengal was that the fishermen had to live in the area of the society; thus, a&#13;
significant proportion of the fishermen, who happened to be migratory, were&#13;
excluded (FAO 1978).&#13;
3.32      Traditional patterns of interaction among members of a society help&#13;
determine the optimal number of individuals that can form an effective&#13;
cooperative organization. Plans for cooperative development that do not&#13;
take this factor into account may encounter difficulties. A scheme in Sri&#13;
Lanka to reorganize 292 small cooperatives into 45 larger ones caused indi-&#13;
vidual fishermen to lose their identity, and cooperation subsequently&#13;
deteriorated (FAO 1978).&#13;
3.33      It is also important to be concerned with variables at the indi-&#13;
vidual level that influence compatibility. Several reports indicate that lack&#13;
of cooperative spirit smong fishermen had a negative effect on cooperative&#13;
functions (Narkswasdi 1967a, FAO 1958, Dibbs 1961). Other reports suggest&#13;
that lack of proper screening means that dishonest and unscrupulous members&#13;
(Narkswasdi 1967a, Miyares del Valle 1974) and members who are not qualified,&#13;
are unwilling to work hard, or are too old or sickly to benefit from the&#13;
use of new equipment or to repay loans (Narkswasdi 1967a) will be admitted.&#13;
3.34      Another variable at the individual level that appears to be related&#13;
to compatibility with fishermen's cooperative organization is temporal orienta-&#13;
tion. Many of the benefits of cooperative membership are not immediate; they&#13;
are realized in the future. Fishermen who expect immediate gratification and&#13;
those who are unable to wait for second payments or bonuses from the coopera-&#13;
tive often sell fish outside the cooperative, where they receive a marginally&#13;
higher immediate price but one that is lower than the cooperative's price if&#13;
second payments are considered (Gibson 1978). Miyares del Valle (1974) also&#13;
suggests that members of a cooperative must be inclined to think of the future--&#13;
must be of a "thrifty disposition"-and suggests that ownership of a boat&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
should be a criterion for membership because it reflects the positive character&#13;
traits that are necessary for effective membership in a cooperative.&#13;
3.35      One aspect of compatibility that is often overlooked in the establish-&#13;
ment of fishermen's cooperatives is the compatibility of a cooperative with&#13;
support structures outside the fishery. As Lele (n.d.) argues, a cooperative&#13;
needs external support structures such as compatible government policies with&#13;
respect to adequate pricing, distribution of inputs, technology, development of&#13;
infrastructure, and regulatory mechanisms.&#13;
3.36      The advantages of membership in a cooperative can change after its&#13;
adoption. In the frequently reported cases of mismanagement and corruption,&#13;
good fishermen found that they were better off before joining and they then&#13;
rejected the institution. In some cases, decrease in external support from&#13;
the government or aid agency caused earlier advantages to be lost, and&#13;
cooperatives were subsequently abandoned by members. Sometimes even&#13;
trialability changes after adoption. When membership strains resources,&#13;
such as processing facilities or docking space, the cooperative closes its&#13;
membership, and those fishermen who cannot join are at a disadvantage; the&#13;
result is local social stress that could endanger the cooperative.&#13;
3.37      Rejection.  Sometimes, after the stage of perception, trial, or&#13;
adoption the fishermen s cooperative is rejected. Many possible reasons&#13;
for this rejection and its effects have already been discussed. Although&#13;
the innovation is rejected, the agency of change might not wish to cease its&#13;
efforts, especially if the failure was due to factors that can be reformu-&#13;
lated. Whether or not the agency wishes to pursue the transfer of the&#13;
rejected innovation, it is important to determine the reasons for rejection.&#13;
It is important to determine which attributes of the innovation, real or&#13;
perceived, brought about its failure. A survey concerning the attitudes,&#13;
beliefs, and values associated with the innovation following its rejection&#13;
may be helpful in pinpointing specific reasons for its failure and facilitate&#13;
further efforts within the same or other target groups. If the innovation&#13;
is not rejected, it becomes institutionalized following the adoption stage.&#13;
3.38      At the institutionalization stage the sociocultural system adapts&#13;
to the innovation. The innovation status is removed and it becomes an&#13;
integral part of the sociocultural system (Rogers and Agarwala-Rogers&#13;
1976). The adaption of a cultural system to an introduced item can have&#13;
broad repercussions. In some instances, for example, fishermen's&#13;
cooperatives succeed in replacing traditional middlemen. In situations in&#13;
which success of this sort is dependent on inputs from the government or&#13;
other outside sources, failure of inputs could lead to the collapse of the&#13;
cooperative. When this happens, the private sector cannot immediately respond&#13;
because the entrepreneurs who were displaced earlier are often involved in&#13;
other businesses. In some instances it could be years before another effective&#13;
distribution system developed in the private sector, and during this interval&#13;
both the producer and the consumer would suffer the loss.&#13;
3.39      Sometimes the establishment of cooperatives can cause intensifica-&#13;
tion of the very social inequities they were meant to eliminate. Earlier it&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
was suggested that if possible, cooperatives should be patterned on tradi-&#13;
tional forms of organization. Lele points out that these traditional forms&#13;
may be based on more hierarchical relationships than is usually recognized&#13;
(n.d.: 27; see also Cochrane 1979) and that development programs may exacerbate&#13;
these relationships, causing even greater inequity and exploitation by the&#13;
elite. McGoodwin (1980) provides an example of such inequities associated with&#13;
inshore fishermen's cooperatives in Mexico. Often, however, fishermen's&#13;
cooperatives that have made it to the institutionalization stage have had&#13;
positive effects in their communities. For example, in Belize, Japan, and&#13;
others noted in the paper.&#13;
2. Features of Fishermen's Society and Culture That Conflict&#13;
with Attempts to Establish Cooperatives&#13;
3.40      Much of the discussion so far has been concerned with the failure&#13;
of cooperatives. It was noted, however, that some attempts to institute&#13;
fishermen's cooperative institutions have been successful. Nevertheless,&#13;
many attempts have been abortive; either the fishermen resisted organiza-&#13;
tion or the cooperatives failed soon after formation. When these failures&#13;
have been considered alongside successful farmers' cooperatives, it has been&#13;
suggested that various aspects of the occupation of fishing work against&#13;
cooperation in the fisheries (cf. Digby 1973).&#13;
3.41      It is on the whole clear that specific attributes of the marine&#13;
environment have affected certain aspects of man's technoeconomic and&#13;
sociocultural adaptation in marine fishing communities 1/ (Pollnac 1976).&#13;
Predictable regional variation in fishery resources, for example, has&#13;
necessitated shifting coastal residences or annual movement between coastal&#13;
fishing residences and inland farms. Regulations to the effect that&#13;
members of cooperatives must reside in a specific region--regulations that&#13;
can easily be applied to farmers-make it impossible for migratory fisher-&#13;
men to join. As noted earlier, this situation created problems in the&#13;
formation of cooperatives in one region of India.&#13;
3.42      Pollnac (1976) has cited specific attributes of maritime adapta-&#13;
tions that have been responsible for the generally low status assigned to&#13;
fishermen in many societies around the world. Digby (1973) suggests that&#13;
this low social standing tends to make fishermen unreceptive to the&#13;
cooperative movement as a consequence of their suspicious attitude toward&#13;
outsiders and their advice. He also suggests that while farmers are&#13;
1/   The Bank, as well as some other aid agencies, group aquaculture, inland,&#13;
and marine fishery projects into one general category-fisheries. But&#13;
these activities differ in ways which have significant sociocultural&#13;
implications. Susan Almy suggests that large, inland lake fisheries&#13;
could be grouped with marine fisheries, but notes, and the present&#13;
author agrees, that if the sociocultural implications of the differences&#13;
between these activites are not taken into account, there may be&#13;
problems associated with project execution. (Almy, 1981)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
settled and have a tradition of mutual aid at harvest, fishermen tend to&#13;
lead seminomadic lives, are hard to locate, and are quite uncooperative out-&#13;
side the sphere of the cooperation that is necessary within a single crew.&#13;
3.43      Numerous researchers have noted that fishermen can be character-&#13;
ized as "independent" types (cf. Pollnac and Ruiz-Stout 1977; Poggie and&#13;
Gersuny 1974; Harrison 1970; Aronoff 1967; Kottak 1966). This independence&#13;
on the part of fishermen has been related to environmental and technological&#13;
constraints of the occupation of fishing (cf. Poggie 1980; Pollnac 1976).&#13;
Poggie (1980) has argued that independence is an adaptive psychological&#13;
trait among fishermen. The decisions that they are forced to make in the&#13;
face of uncertainty, for example, have immediate effects with respect to&#13;
the safety of the vessel and its crew as well as to the success of the&#13;
hunt. These decisions must be made without hesitation because of the&#13;
rapidly changing nature of the sea (Pollnac 1976). Poggie (1980) also&#13;
relates this independence to the fact that fishermen are physically removed&#13;
from the help and support of land-based society. He notes that while at sea&#13;
fishermen carry out complicated tasks independently, virtually without&#13;
verbal communication with other fishermen. Each crewman works and makes&#13;
decisions by himself.&#13;
3.44      As noted earlier in this paper, relations among small-scale fisher-&#13;
men are usually egalitarian. Norr and Norr (1974) have suggested that the&#13;
need for coordination within fishing crews and the physical risks associated&#13;
with the marine environment increase both the need for interdependence and&#13;
the importance of each worker. This, in combination with the rapid depre-&#13;
ciation of equipment and the possibility of its loss decreases the social&#13;
and economic distance between owners and laborers. Hence, they argue, work&#13;
relations among members of fishing crews should be more egalitarian than&#13;
those among farmers. Their data and the ethnographic literature support this&#13;
proposition. Norr (1972) reports that few distinctions are made within work&#13;
groups among fishermen of South India, for example--that the owner does not&#13;
direct work but participates as an equal. Burrows and Spiro (1953) comment&#13;
on the egalitarian nature of fishing work groups in Ifaluk, contrasting it&#13;
with the general consciousness of rank in Ifaluk society. On Taiwan,&#13;
Diamond (1969) notes, friendship characterizes the relations among crew&#13;
members. T. Gladwin (1970) reports that although the navigator is in command&#13;
of the vessel on Pulawat, he is not aloof; he pays attention to the&#13;
suggestions of crew members and imparts a spirit of egalitarianism. Finally,&#13;
at Arembepe, Brazil, Kottak (1966) writes, the captain works like the members&#13;
of his crew. When the fishing begins he is the same as the crew. This&#13;
egalitarianism suggests that fishermen would be receptive to cooperation.&#13;
But Poggie (1980) emphasizes that "egalitarianism is the only noncoercive way&#13;
that individuals with high need for independence can be organized into a&#13;
crew" (p. 21). He suggests that the need for independence is thus one of&#13;
the causal factors in egalitarianism on board and argues further that this&#13;
psychological trait of independence is a factor in the lack of success of&#13;
fishermen's cooperatives. It is important to note, however, that Poggie&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
did not say that need for independence is the only factor; he left open the&#13;
possibility that other factors are also important 1/&#13;
3.45      Although it is tempting to make the claim that there is some in-&#13;
trinsic aspect of the occupation of fishing that makes fishermen less like-&#13;
ly than agriculturalists to cooperate, it must be remembered that there are&#13;
successful fishermen's cooperatives (cf. Poggie 1980; Pollnac 1978c, 1977;&#13;
Digby 1973; FAO 1971) as well as unsuccessful agricultural cooperatives&#13;
(cf. Digby 1973; Inayatullah 1972; Borda 1971). Some of the explanations&#13;
offered to account for the failure of fishermen's cooperatives could apply&#13;
equally to agricultural cooperatives (cf. Pollnac 1978; Digby 1973). In&#13;
some instances moreover, fishermen's cooperatives have failed because the&#13;
model used was that of an agricultural cooperative, and aspects of the&#13;
occupation of fishing conflicted with some of its structural features (cf.&#13;
Pollnac 1978c). Alexander (1975) provides a good example of problems&#13;
encountered when differences between farmers and fishermen are not taken&#13;
into account.  He notes that in Sri Lanka new fishing gear was introduced,&#13;
sometimes through cooperative organizations, which was relatively expensive&#13;
and deteriorated more rapidly than the traditional gear, which lasted longer&#13;
and could be replaced out of current earnings and small loans. -&#13;
The new gear thus required making provision for replacement. Nevertheless,&#13;
no provisions for replacement were made, even in cooperative organizations.&#13;
The form of the fishermen's cooperative organizations was transferred&#13;
directly from farming, where the primary resource, land, appreciates with the&#13;
passage of time; failure to take the basic technoeconomic differences between&#13;
farming and fishing into account caused difficulties. Another feature of the&#13;
marine environment also has an adverse effect on cooperative operations. The&#13;
short-term periodicity of marine resources causes variance in catch and,&#13;
subsequently, in income. Loans made by the government to Sri Lankan fisher-&#13;
men failed to take this fact into account: the monthly payments were inflex-&#13;
ibly required to be made, irrespective of the size of the catch (Alexander&#13;
1975). Middlemen in most fishing communities have had long experience with&#13;
fishermen and their adaptation to the sea; they therefore understand these&#13;
environmental constraints and usually act accordingly, adapting to variability&#13;
of catch by permitting some flexibility in the repayment of loans. The&#13;
periodic nature of marine resources often places the middleman in the role of&#13;
benefactor to fishermen when catches are light, and his ability and willing-&#13;
ness to provide loans when the sea destroys or damages productive equipment&#13;
strengthens this role. Thus, if fishermen's cooperative organizations are to&#13;
succeed, they must manifest the same type of flexibility to match the periodic&#13;
nature of the marine resource. Black (1977) suggests that Madras fishermen&#13;
1/   Pollnac (1980) found no difference between Azorian farmers and fishermen&#13;
in their attitudes toward cooperation. He suggested, however, that the&#13;
reason was probably that the degree of perceived pressure on resources,&#13;
interpersonal distrust, and perceived risks is similar for both sectors&#13;
of the population sampled. Clearly, more research on this point is&#13;
needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
in India were reluctant to use cooperative marketing schemes because the&#13;
marketing cooperatives, unlike the traditional middlemen did not make loans&#13;
for weddings, funerals, holidays, and expenses incurred during unproductive&#13;
periods. McGoodwin (1980) also points out that problems in meeting loan&#13;
repayment schedules was one of the factors contributing to the decline of&#13;
the inshore Pacific fishing cooperatives in Mexico. The cooperatives, based&#13;
on Mexican agrarian collectives [ejidos], did not take into account the&#13;
periodic nature of marine production.&#13;
3.46      McGoodwin (1980) also cited other problems that stemmed from the&#13;
attempt to organize fishermen's cooperatives in the same manner as farmers-&#13;
cooperatives. Production sites for fishermen's cooperatives were fixed in&#13;
the same manner as they were for the ejidos. Lagoonal boundaries, however,&#13;
are subject to erosion and shifting, while the location of agricultural land&#13;
remains constant. Thus, within a period of only a few years a fishing&#13;
cooperative could lose nearly all of its most productive harvesting areas.&#13;
3. Successful Small-Scale Fishermen's Cooperatives&#13;
3.47      Although most of the discussion so far has been concerned with&#13;
variables associated with the failure of fishermen's cooperatives, it should&#13;
be noted that many are successful.   As indicated by the projects discussed&#13;
thus far, however, the literature tends to dwell more on the failures, thereby&#13;
presenting a false impression that all or nearly all fishermen's cooperatives&#13;
are doomed to failure. Where successful cooperatives are found, they are&#13;
usually passed over with a brief reference, and little or no discussion of the&#13;
factors involved in their success is offered. Lamming and Hotta (1980), for&#13;
example, review fishermen's cooperatives in six countries of Western Africa.&#13;
They write of existing cooperatives, but they offer few details as to how they&#13;
differ from the failures. Also in Africa, the Kenyan Fishery Project appraisal&#13;
report notes that several of the marine fishermen's cooperatives are commer-&#13;
cially viable, yet nothing has been written to account for their success in&#13;
comparison to the performance of the inland cooperatives although the majority&#13;
of the credit funds of the project will go to eleven cooperatives.   Examples&#13;
such as these are numerous, but here it will suffice to examine several&#13;
examples that offer some reasons for their success.&#13;
3.48      In many countries, both industrial and developing, there are fish-&#13;
ermen's cooperatives that are successful as a result of their sociocultural&#13;
compatibility with the target fishermen. Fishermen's cooperatives that have&#13;
developed in areas where there is a long history of cooperative religious&#13;
and secular societies, such as Italy (Cattarinussi 1973), are quite success-&#13;
ful. The success of fishermen's cooperatives in some societies has been&#13;
related, in part, to cultural patterns of deeply rooted group consciousness&#13;
and loyalty, as in Japan (Hamlisch and Hotta 1978), or to the closeknit&#13;
nature of a group of related fishermen like one found in a Malaysian&#13;
cooperative (Narkswasdi 1967b).&#13;
3.49      In general, however, one feature that is associated with many&#13;
successful fishermen's cooperatives is their having been generated by the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
fishermen from below rather than by the government or some external agency.&#13;
Examples of successful cooperatives generated from below can be found in&#13;
Belize (Gibson 1978; FAO 1971), in Italy (Cattarinussi 1973), among a Chinese&#13;
minority in Malaysia (Narkswasdi 1967b), in the Philippines (Castillo Obispo&#13;
1980), and in the United States (Poggie and Gersuny 1974). The fishermen's&#13;
cooperatives in Belize are so successful that Gibson (1978) reported that&#13;
the FAO chose Belize as a site for training others in the organization of&#13;
cooperatives.&#13;
3.50      In situations in which development proceeds from below it is&#13;
more likely that the cooperative structure was selected because it was&#13;
seen as compatible with the society, culture, and needs of the fishermen.&#13;
Since it evolved from below, furthermore, its specific operating procedures&#13;
probably evolved in a way that suited the members who were responsible for&#13;
their evolution. With involvement of the target group at the beginning of&#13;
development, the structures evolved are more likely to be compatible and thus&#13;
more likely to be accepted by participants.&#13;
3.51      It should be made clear at this point that all types of cooperatives&#13;
are found among those that are successful, whether marketing, supply, produc-&#13;
tion, or multipurpose. There might be some differences in frequencies of&#13;
failure, but support of cooperatives should be based not on success ratios but&#13;
on sound research, such as that provided in the following section of this&#13;
paper, that indicates a need for a specific type and a society that can&#13;
implement the type successfully. Determination of the sociocultural founda-&#13;
tion for success rests upon research conducted by competent sociologists and&#13;
anthropologists.&#13;
&#13;

IV SOCIOCULTURAL KNOWLEDGE NEEDED FOR DESIGNING&#13;
FISHERMEN-S COOPERATIVES&#13;
4.1       In preceding sections of this paper numerous factors in the success-&#13;
ful introduction and maintenance of fishermen's cooperatives were identified.&#13;
It would be possible to stop here and state that the Bank must take these&#13;
factors into account in designing projects that involve fishermen's coopera-&#13;
tives. Termination at this point, however, would leave unanswered an&#13;
extremely important question: How can the Bank or any other development&#13;
agency take these factors into account? The purpose of this section is to&#13;
present several examples of techniques used to generate knowledge on socio-&#13;
cultural variables-that have to do with the success or failure of fishermen's&#13;
cooperatives.&#13;
1. Fishermen's Perception of Institutions to be Replaced by Cooperatives.&#13;
4.2       One of the most frequent goals of fishermen's cooperative organiza-&#13;
tions is to replace the middleman, who is widely regarded as an exploiter of&#13;
the fishermen. Nevertheless, as noted earlier, cooperatives often find that&#13;
they cannot compete with established middlemen. This is often due to the&#13;
fact that middlemen provide efficient marketing and other services to the&#13;
fishermen (see comments in Chapter 3; see also Lele n.d., FAO 1958, 1975,&#13;
1978). The problem is that most of these observations are made after a&#13;
cooperative has failed or when it is in the process of failing. If a&#13;
cooperative is to replace the middleman, it is essential to have the fisher-&#13;
man's evaluation of services supplied by the middleman. Once these services&#13;
have been identified and evaluated they can be worked into the design of the&#13;
cooperative. Then a cost-benefit analysis of the cooperative and the&#13;
middlemen could be used to determine whether a fishermen's marketing&#13;
cooperative is in fact a realistic possibility.&#13;
4.3       A study that I conducted in Costa Rica illustrates techniques that&#13;
can be used to determine fishermen's perceptions of services provided by&#13;
middlemen. In an attempt to gain a more complete understanding of the middle-&#13;
man in Costa Rica, eighty small-scale fishermen were interviewed in the Gulf of&#13;
Nicoya. Fifty were from an urban area, Puntarenas, and thirty from a rural&#13;
community, Costa de Pajaros. The middleman, or fish buyer, is an important&#13;
element of the structure of the small-scale fishing industry in the Gulf of&#13;
Nicoya. On the short strip of coastline where interviews were conducted in&#13;
Puntarenas seven middlemen were active. At Costa de Pajaros five were active.&#13;
There were other middlemen in both areas, but they were either outside the&#13;
area sampled or not active during the research period. Ostensibly, the&#13;
middleman performs the important function of purchasing fish from the fisher-&#13;
man for resale to other middlemen or retailers. He does, however, provide&#13;
other services for fishermen. The number of active middlemen in the region&#13;
and statements made by fishermen suggest that there is competition among the&#13;
various buyers; fishermen were therefore asked why they sell to one middleman&#13;
rather than another. The percentage distribution for the first three responses&#13;
to this open-ended question can be found in Table 3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

N - 80&#13;
a/ Total exceeds 100 percent because entries reflect categorization&#13;
of the first three responses to an open-ended question.&#13;
4.4       The most frequently offered rationale for selecting one buyer over&#13;
another is the prices that he pays for fish. The second most frequent is&#13;
that a fisherman would rather deal with a buyer who helps him in some way,&#13;
such as lending him money or picking up parts. Fishermen also select buyers&#13;
on the basis of what they perceive as fair treatment. Fair treatment includes&#13;
honesty, immediate payment for product, and not discarding marginally spoiled&#13;
fish. Nine percent of the fishermen report that they sell to a specific buyer&#13;
because they are in debt to him, while eight percent claim that they make&#13;
their decision on the basis of friendship. A small proportion of the fisher-&#13;
men choose middlemen who never refuse their product. Some middlemen refuse to&#13;
buy when the market is glutted, and the fishermen are forced to let their&#13;
product rot. Several fishermen noted that they deal with a specific buyer&#13;
because he is located closer to their home. The "other" category includes&#13;
idosyncratic responses such as "character of buyer," "landing facilities,"&#13;
and "responsibility."&#13;
4.5       The salient high-frequency responses were crosstabulated with&#13;
area of residence. The expectation that urban fishermen would be more likely&#13;
than rural to select buyers on the basis ol price was supported by the data&#13;
(44 percent and 23 percent respectively; X = 3.47, p &lt; 0.05; one-tailed test).&#13;
Urban fishermen are more involved in the cash economy; thus, we would expect&#13;
that prices paid by middlemen would be the salient attribute in the urban&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
area. In contrast, the rural fishermen are more interested in the help that&#13;
the middleman provides in the form of loans, picking2up parts for equipment,&#13;
and so on (37 percent and 14 percent respectively; X = 5.52, p &lt;0.02).&#13;
Finally, there is2no relation between area of residence and the "fair treat-&#13;
ment" category (X = 0.02, p &gt;0.10).&#13;
4.6       Although more sophisticated techniques of collection and analysis&#13;
of data could have been used, this relatively simple study produced the&#13;
following information on which to base operationally significant decisions&#13;
concerning the establishment of marketing cooperatives among these fishermen:&#13;
1.   A content analysis of the attributes included in the category "provides&#13;
help" would indicate the services that a cooperative would have to provide&#13;
to compete with middlemen.&#13;
2.   Rural-urban differences indicate that analyses must proceed under&#13;
the assumption that there will be regional variation and that cooperative&#13;
structures cannot be uniform for an entire country, but must be adapted&#13;
to regional needs.&#13;
2.   Fishermen's Perceptions of Cooperative Organizations&#13;
4.7       As noted in earlier sections of this paper, fishermen's percep-&#13;
tions of cooperative organizations have much to do with their acceptance.&#13;
An awareness of these perceptions is important for several reasons: first,&#13;
it helps explain fishermen's attitudes toward cooperatives; second, it&#13;
facilitates recognition of areas of dissonance that might arise from percep-&#13;
tions that do not match the real effects of cooperatives; and third, it is&#13;
an aid in the development of information programs that will produce more&#13;
realistic perceptions of the effects of fishermen's cooperatives, which&#13;
will enhance their chances of success.&#13;
4.8       In 1975 I collected data concerning the perception of fishermen's&#13;
cooperatives among small-scale fishermen in the Republic of Panama. At that&#13;
time the Panamanian government was encouraging the establishment of fisher-&#13;
men's cooperatives among its small-scale fishermen. This program was not&#13;
proving successful at the time, so it was deemed important to obtain some&#13;
feedback from the fishermen (see Pollnac 1977).&#13;
4.9       Perception of fishermen's cooperative organizations was determined&#13;
from a content analysis of the responses to the following three open-ended&#13;
questions:&#13;
1.   What are the benefits of belonging to a fishermen's cooperative?&#13;
2.   What is a fishermen's cooperative supposed to do?&#13;
3.   What would you do if you were president of a fishermen's cooperative?&#13;
Background sociocultural information--age, formal education, and so on-was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
determined from responses to direct questions. These questions formed part&#13;
of a one-page interview that was administered to 153 small-scale fishermen&#13;
in the Republic of Panama. 1/ Fishermen were interviewed in a range of&#13;
locations that extended from Colon on the Atlantic coast to Panama City on&#13;
the Pacific and at numerous locations along the Pacific Coast from Panama&#13;
City to the Costa Rican border. Several of the locations had functioning&#13;
cooperative or precooperative organizations, and at a some locations,&#13;
fishermen's organizations had failed. Forty-eight percent of the sample&#13;
were members of either cooperatives or precooperatives. Readers are&#13;
referred to Pollnac (1977) for details concerning the analysis and results&#13;
of this research. Only a summary will be presented here.&#13;
4.10      There was a great deal of overlap in patterns of response to the&#13;
three questions concerning various aspects of a fisherman's knowledge of&#13;
cooperative organizations. The response category that appeared most fre-&#13;
quently had to do with provision or availability of equipment. This response&#13;
category was provided more than twice as often as any other category. It thus&#13;
seems that the Panamanian small-scale fish,erman sees the cooperative primarily&#13;
as a means of obtaining equipment. The fact that none of the independent&#13;
sociocultural variables-age, education, membership in a cooperative or pre-&#13;
cooperative, or years fishing-was related significantly to the distribution&#13;
of this response category indicates that it is a widely shared attribute,&#13;
forming part of the conceptualization of fishermen's cooperatives among the&#13;
fishermen in the sample.&#13;
4.11      The next most frequent response had to do with marketing attributes&#13;
of fishermen's cooperatives. Analyses demonstrated that members of coopera-&#13;
tives or precooperatives are more likely to see this as an important attribute&#13;
of cooperative organizations than are nonmembers.&#13;
4.12      The cooperative was also frequently perceived as a source of funds.&#13;
Fishermen see the cooperative as a mechanism for obtaining funds from govern-&#13;
ment sources as well as a means of accumulating a pool of funds from dues,&#13;
percentage of the proceeds of fish sales, and social activities. The distri-&#13;
bution of this response category, however, indicates that members of coopera-&#13;
tives or precooperatives mentioned this attribute significantly more often&#13;
than did nonmembers. This, too, indicates a lack of knowledge concerning&#13;
cooperative organizations on the part of nonmembers.&#13;
4.13      A significant number of responses reflected the attribute of&#13;
cooperation among members. Once again the only sociocultural variable signifi-&#13;
cantly related to this attribute was membership in a cooperative or precooper-&#13;
ative. There was, however, a relatively weak tendency for older fishermen to&#13;
make reference to this attribute also.&#13;
4.14      Finally, the next most frequent response category referred to&#13;
provision of adequate administration. This time, however, it was those&#13;
1/   Analyses of all data collected can be found in Pollnac (1977) and&#13;
Pollnac and Poggie (1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
who were not members of a cooperative or precooperative who mentioned this&#13;
category most frequently. This unexpected relation suggests that something&#13;
other than membership in a cooperative or precooperative is affecting the&#13;
response pattern. It was therefore decided to examine the response patterns&#13;
of fishermen who had belonged to a cooperative in the past and had left for&#13;
some reason. There were total of twenty seven former members of cooperatives&#13;
or precooperatives. Of these, 26 percent responded that they would improve&#13;
administration if they were president of a cooperative. Only 11 percent of&#13;
the others made this response--a difference that is statistically s^ignificant&#13;
2&#13;
X = 4.121, p &lt;0.05). It is thus former members of cooperatives who tend to&#13;
consider proper administration an important attribute.&#13;
4.15      Another important aspect of the findings concerns the sociocultural&#13;
correlates of lack of knowledge about fishermen's cooperatives. Fully 39&#13;
percent of the fishermen did not know the benefits of cooperative membership&#13;
(Question 1, above), 21 percent did not,know the function of a cooperative&#13;
(Question 2), and 16 percent had no idea what they would do if they were&#13;
president of a fishmen's cooperative (Question 3). The responses to these&#13;
questions can be arranged on a rather simple scale of knowledge about fisher-&#13;
men's cooperatives. Scale valuea range from zero (a "don't know" response&#13;
to all three questions) to three (a response provided to all three questions).&#13;
The analysis of the interrelationships between this scale and a selection of&#13;
other variables made it possible to posit and test a simple causal model: 1/&#13;
First, the more formal education a person has, the more likely it is that&#13;
he will read newspapers; second, the greater the frequency with which a&#13;
person reads newspapers, the more likely it is that he will be exposed to&#13;
information concerning fishermen's cooperatives, either in the newspapers&#13;
or other printed material; third, the more information a person has con-&#13;
cerning a cooperative, the more likely it is that he will either form or&#13;
join one. The intercorrelations among these variables can be found in&#13;
Table 4, and the simple causal model that reflects their interrelations&#13;
is depicted in Figure 6. The correlations between the variables can also&#13;
be found in parentheses adjacent to the arrows connecting the variables.&#13;

4.16      A causal model, such as that presented in Figure 4, can be tested&#13;
by means of a variety of techniques. A technique based on partial corre-&#13;
lations (Blalock 1964) is used here because the dependent variable is&#13;
dichotomous, and the use of beta weights as path coefficients would be&#13;
questionable. This technique predicts that if the causal model depicted&#13;
in Figure 4 is acceptable, the following relations should exist:&#13;
1.   r132   -0.0&#13;
2.   r24.3   -0.0&#13;

4.17      As can be seen in Table 5, differences between the actual and&#13;
predicted partial correlations are insignificant. It should be noted,&#13;
however, that the validity of the model has not been completely established:&#13;
the situation wherein all arrows are reversed would lead to identical predic-&#13;
tions. Nevertheless, despite its mathematical acceptability, the situation in&#13;
which the arrows are reversed is not a realistic theoretical alternative. I&#13;
therefore suggest that the model presented in Figure 6 is both theoreticallj&#13;
and mathematically acceptable and present it tentatively as depicting the&#13;
relations between formal education, exposure to mass media, and membership in&#13;
a cooperative.&#13;
4.18      This model is important because it helps explain the unexpected&#13;
lack of significant relations between formal education and knowledge about&#13;
cooperative organizations that was reported in an earlier paper (Pollnac&#13;
and Ruiz-Stout 1976). This model suggests that exposure to mass media-&#13;
what Rogers (1969) refers to as the "magic multiplier"-acts as an inter-&#13;
vening variable. Thus, until exposure to mass media is taken into account,&#13;
the indirect relations between formal education and knowledge or acceptance&#13;
of an innovation-here the cooperative--could be obscured.&#13;
4.19      Analysis of the data also indicated a relation between exposure&#13;
to a modern urban way of living and membership in and perceptions of fisher-&#13;
men's cooperatives. The sample was divided into three subgroups on the&#13;
basis of exposure to modern urban ways of living: an urban subgroup located&#13;
in towns with populations exceeding 50,000; an intermediate subgroup adjacent&#13;
to or in towns with populations greater than 10,000 but less than 50,000; and&#13;
a rural subgroup adjacent to towns with populations of 5,000 or less. Fisher-&#13;
men's cooperatives existed in all three areas.&#13;
4.20      Distribution of membership in cooperatives and high-frequency.&#13;
response categories that represent benefits of belonging to a fishermen's&#13;
cooperative (Question 1) can be found in Table 6.&#13;

a/   N does not equal that total of response category frequencies because&#13;
only high-frequency categories are examined here.&#13;
4.21      Table 6 contains several important bits of information.   First,&#13;
although all three regions have cooperatives, the incidence of membership&#13;
is greater in the urban areas. The inverse relation between degree of&#13;
removal from urban society and membership in a cooperative is so clear that&#13;
no statistical tests are needed. Second, there is a positive relation be-&#13;
tween degree of removal from urban society and lack of knowledge of the benefits&#13;
of cooperatives. Third, urban fishermen are more likely to mention social&#13;
b_nefits than are nonurban fishermen (28 percent and 7 percent respectively&#13;
X = 12.78, P &lt;0.01). Similar regional variation occurs with re^pect to&#13;
specific responses to the other two questions.&#13;
4.22      The information presented here represents only a small part of&#13;
the information concerning fishermen's cooperatives amassed from research&#13;
in Panama (Pollnac 1977). Nevertheless, the portion presented here will&#13;
serve as an example to demonstrate the influence of sociocultural data in&#13;
decision making during the design or implementation phases of small-scale&#13;
fishery projects that involve cooperatives..&#13;
1.        Perceptions of cooperatives should be compared with planned&#13;
activities. If there are differences, one of two measures can be taken:&#13;
planned cooperatives can be adjusted to meet perceptions, or educational&#13;
programs can be designed to align perceptions with reality. The specific&#13;
path taken depends upon a realistic analysis of the ability of the&#13;
cooperative to meet expectations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
2.   Once again, regional variation indicates that the structures of coopera-&#13;
tives should probably be adapted to regional needs as indicated by responses.&#13;
3.   Variation in knowledge concerning cooperatives suggests that cooperative&#13;
extension training is not reaching all fishermen with equal effect. The data&#13;
indicate that more emphasis must be placed on reaching the more rural fisher-&#13;
men and that information programs should be designed which will reach the less&#13;
well-educated and those with limited exposure to the mass media.&#13;
4.23      These brief examples were not intended as general statements about&#13;
fishermen's cooperatives, but as an illustration of the way sociocultural data&#13;
can be analysed to provide information of value to decision-makers involved in&#13;
fishery-development projects.&#13;

V. OPERATIONAL RECOMMENDATIONS&#13;
5.1       The significance of sociocultural variables to the development&#13;
of small-scale fisheries has been examined briefly for its general applica-&#13;
bility, then examined in detail as it pertains to the development of fisher-&#13;
men's cooperatives.&#13;
5.2       A model of the diffusion of innovations was applied to the develop-&#13;
ment of fishermen's cooperatives, and sociocultural variables leading to the&#13;
adoption, rejection, success, or failure of this type of organization were&#13;
derived from both project reports and the author's experience. Several&#13;
types of sociocultural data related to the acceptance or rejection of fisher-&#13;
men's cooperatives were examined to see whether they could be converted into&#13;
information of use in decision-making. Examples of operationally relevant&#13;
decisions that were based on the information were provided. The purpose of&#13;
this section of the paper is to make recommendations concerning the use of&#13;
the preceding sections in determining where sociocultural variables are&#13;
needed in the decision making process concerning the employment of fisher-&#13;
men's cooperatives in World Bank-assisted projects.&#13;
5.3       Figure 7 illustrates decision points encountered in the use of a&#13;
fishermen's cooperative in a development project. By moving through the&#13;
diagram step by step it will be possible to identify points at which&#13;
sociocultural data of the type identified in this paper will be necessary&#13;
to the making of informed decisions.&#13;
5.4       First it can be assumed that for some reason-government pressure&#13;
or orientation of planners, for example-an initial decision has been made&#13;
to involve a fishermen's cooperative in the proposed project. The first&#13;
step is to determine whether a fishermen's cooperative already exists in&#13;
the target area. If one exists (denoted by a "+" on the box), the next&#13;
step is to evaluate its compatibility with the project. The evaluation is&#13;
multidimensional in that technicians and economists will evaluate its economic&#13;
and technical compatibility with the goals of the project and the anthro-&#13;
pologist or sociologist will determine its socioculture suitability. All&#13;
dimensions are of equivalent importance, but since sociocultural attributes,&#13;
specifically, are the topic of this paper they will remain the focus.&#13;
5.5       Assuming that adequate technical and economic evaluation has been&#13;
made, the attributes of an innovation listed in Figure 5 will form an&#13;
adequate frame of reference for sociocultural evaluation. Sociocultural&#13;
variables noted above as being associated with these attributes should&#13;
receive special attention. Interviews with both member and nonmember fisher-&#13;
men in the region may uncover sociocultural, economic, or technical incom-&#13;
patibilities not indicated through routine economic or technical evaluation.&#13;
It has been my experience that interviews conducted with officials and&#13;
members of cooperatives who are conveniently present when an outsider visits,&#13;
for example, are singularly unrevealing. This is especially true with&#13;
respect to the least effective cooperatives. Members, who are often the&#13;

least efficient fishermen in the region have the most to gain from outside&#13;
aid. Questions put to fishermen who have dropped out of the society or&#13;
have refused to join are often the most revealing.&#13;
5.6       If the existing cooperative is found to be fully compatible with&#13;
the proposed project, then the decision is simple-use it. If, however, it&#13;
is not compatible ("-" on the box) whether reorganization of the cooperative&#13;
is possible or not must be determined by sociological assessment. Attributes&#13;
of the cooperative (see Figure 5) that are problematic should be examined for&#13;
possible adjustment. If adjustments are possible, the availability of inputs&#13;
and external support structures compatible with the new adjustments should&#13;
be determined (next box). If either the cooperative is too incompatible to&#13;
be reconstructed 1/ or inputs and external support structures are unavail-&#13;
able, the emphasis placed by the government on cooperatives becomes an&#13;
important variable. If the government has a vested interest in promoting&#13;
cooperatives, the problems should be presented and permission requested to use&#13;
another form of organization. If permission is granted to use another form or&#13;
if the government places no emphasis on the development of cooperatives,&#13;
then another form of organization for development should be considered-the&#13;
community fishery center advocated by Ben-Yami (1980), for example. In some&#13;
cases, however, the responsible government officials will be so shielded&#13;
from the reality of the inefficiencies and corruption that exist in the&#13;
fishing community and so attached to the ideology of the international&#13;
cooperative movement that they will refuse to deviate from their chosen path.&#13;
In such cases the only reasonable alternative is to abandon the project.&#13;
5.7       Returning to the path of proposed reorganization, if the inputs and&#13;
external support structures needed for the new form are available, the changes&#13;
must be legal. As noted earlier, some countries have established by-laws con-&#13;
taining rigid standards that an association must meet if it is to be chartered&#13;
as a cooperative and enjoy legislated advantages, if there are any.&#13;
5.8       It is at this stage that the path of a newly proposed cooperative&#13;
meets that of a reorganized one. If no fishermen-s cooperative exists in the&#13;
target area, standard operating procedures for the proposed organization&#13;
should be developed using guidelines suggested above in the discussion of&#13;
Figure 5. Once again, adequate technical and economic evaluation is needed&#13;
in addition to the sociocultural input that is the topic of this paper.&#13;
Evaluation of the sociocultural variables associated with the attributes of&#13;
a fishermen-s cooperative should be conducted concurrently with technical&#13;
and economic evaluations. Cochrane (1979) provides an excellent overview&#13;
of this process, and examples cited earlier should enable the field worker&#13;
to select the variables that are associated with the specific form of&#13;
cooperative. As noted, involvement of the potential members at this stage&#13;
will increase the likelihood that an appropriate organization form can be&#13;
1/   Some reports cited above involved cooperatives that were so inefficient&#13;
that no self-respecting fisherman would consider membership. In these&#13;
cases the most reasonable alternative is to abandon the existing&#13;
structure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52&#13;
evolved through the process of "adaptive reseatch" (cf. Mickelwait and&#13;
others 1979). The proposed organization must then be evaluated in relation&#13;
to the availability of inputs and external support structures. If they&#13;
are not available or cannot be made available, the possibility of using&#13;
a noncooperative organizational structure must be determined by going&#13;
through the same cycle, which will either terminate in the development&#13;
and use of another organization or abandonment of the project. If inputs&#13;
and external support structures are available and adequate, the proposed&#13;
cooperative must surmount the same obstacle as the reorganized society-&#13;
possible legal restrictions.&#13;
5.9       In many countries laws govern the organization of cooperatives.&#13;
These laws should be taken into account in either the development or re-&#13;
organization of a cooperative. In some cases the laws will be flexible&#13;
enough to accomodate an organizational form appropriate to the project under&#13;
development. In such a situation, the remaining step is to organize or&#13;
reorganize the cooperative. In other situations, the rigidity of laws may&#13;
prohibit formation of a cooperative with a structure congruent with the&#13;
project. It will then be necessary to try to obtain partial exemption from the&#13;
law or influence its change. If this is impossible, permission to use another&#13;
form of organization must be obtained or the project will have to be abandoned.&#13;
If it is possible to amend the law or gain exemption, the remaining step is to&#13;
organize or reorganize the fishermen's cooperative.&#13;
5.10      At this point in the process Figure 5 is entered at the contact&#13;
stage. If steps called for in Figure 7 have been carried out, trial and&#13;
adoption should proceed smoothly and effectively.   Nevertheless, the&#13;
system established should have a bidlt-in meehanism that will facilitate&#13;
periodic monitoring and evaluation to ensure itts continued, success&#13;
(Cochrane 1979).&#13;

            Sociocultural aspects of developing
            small-scale fisheries : delivering services to the poor
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The purpose of this paper is neither to
            advocate nor condemn fishermen's cooperative
            organizations. As will be seen in the report, there are
            sufficient individuals and organizations that take one of
            these two extreme positions. This report, rather, is a
            response to the following, well-established facts: (1) many
            developing countries mandate the use of fishermen's
            cooperatives in small-scale fishery development; (2) some
            development agencies advocate the use of fishermen's
            cooperatives; (3) there have been numerous failures, as well
            as successes, of fishermen's cooperatives. These facts,
            which are elaborated in the body of the paper, suggest that
            there is a need for an objective examination of the
            cooperative in the context of small-scale fisheries
            development programs. It is hoped that such an examination
            can lead to more rational evaluation of this widespread
            organizational form.
