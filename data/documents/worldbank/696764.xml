        <abstracts>
            In project finance, risks are allocated
            to the parties best able to manage them.  However, the risk
            mitigation instruments incorporated in the project's
            contractual and financial arrangements need not be
            all-encompassing to provide the security investors require.
            Commitments may be limited in scope, amount, and duration.
            This Note provides a checklist of commercial risk mitigation
            instruments commonly used in project finance by private
            lenders and sometimes by equity investors.  The checklist is
            structured around a project's development cycle: the
            construction phase and the operating phase.  During the
            construction period, three main groups of instruments are
            used to mitigate risk: contractual arrangements and
            associated guarantees, contingency funds and lines of
            credit, and private insurance.  The instruments most
            commonly used to mitigate risk during the operating period
            are: contractual arrangements, contingency reserves, cash
            traps, insurance, and risk compensation devices.
