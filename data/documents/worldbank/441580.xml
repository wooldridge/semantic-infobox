        <abstracts>
            Private participation in electricity
            industries has grown substantially since 1990, with
            electricity becoming one of the leading infrastructure
            sectors in attracting private investment. Between 1990 and
            1997 the private sector took on the management, operations,
            rehabilitation, or construction risk of 534 electricity
            projects, with total investments of US$131 billion. These
            projects have been implemented under schemes ranging from
            management contracts with or without investment commitments
            to divestitures to greenfield facilities under
            build-operate-transfer (BOT), or similar arrangements. This
            Note provides an overview of the patterns and trends in
            these projects.
