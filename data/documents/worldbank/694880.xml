Note No.110  Investment Funds in Mass Privatization&#13;
Lessons from Russia and the Czech Republic&#13;
Katharinia Pistor   Investment funds have a key role to play in mass privatization. But have they lived up to expecta-&#13;
and              tions? This Note looks at that question in the two best-known cases-Russia and the Czech&#13;
Andrew Spicer&#13;
Republic, the first to experiment on a large scale with mass privatization and the only two for&#13;
which enough time has elapsed and enough data are available to permit a tentative assessment.'&#13;
The Note argues that in both cases expectations have not been met and the initial design prob-&#13;
lems in mass privatization-asymmetric information and imperfect property rights-still remain.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            Investment funds play a key role in mass
            privatization in many transition economies.  But have they
            lived up to expectations?  The authors look at that question
            in the two earliest and best-known cases--Russia and the
            Czech Republic. The evidence is discouraging.  It appears
            that the funds have either not been able to enhance the
            value of their holdings or have failed to share any gains
            with their investors.  Dividends have been extremely low.
            Property rights created in a hasty attempt to depoliticize
            property relations are weak.  And capital markets remain
            illiquid.  Many funds have simply become holding companies
            rather than active portfolio investors.  The initial design
            problems in mass privatization--asymmetric information and
            imperfect property rights--remain.
