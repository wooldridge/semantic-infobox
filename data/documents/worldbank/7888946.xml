There are two main sources of potential interest rate                        IBRD's existingloans has traditionally helped limit&#13;

&#13;
associatedwith the net spread between the rate IBRD                          on its loan portfolio. Such cost pass-through loans&#13;

earns on its assets and the cost of borrowings, which                        currently account for approximately 65% of the&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The management of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) is&#13;
    responsible for the preparation, integrity, and fair presentation of its published financial&#13;
    statements and all other information presented in the accompanying Management's Discussion&#13;
    and Analysis. The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting&#13;
    principles generally accepted in the United States of America and International Financial&#13;
    ~ e ~ o r tStandards and, as such, include amounts based on informed judgments and estimates&#13;
                i n ~&#13;
    made by management.&#13;
&#13;
   The financial statements have been audited by an independent accounting firm, which was given&#13;
   unrestricted access to all financial records and related data, including minutes of all meetings of&#13;
   the Board of Executive Directors and committees of the Board. Management believes that all&#13;
   representations made to the independent auditors during their audit were valid and appropriate.&#13;
   The independent auditors' report accompanies the audited financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
   Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over&#13;
   external financial reporting for financial presentations in conformity with both accounting&#13;
   principles generally accepted in the United States of America and International Financial&#13;
   Reporting Standards. The system of internal control contains monitoring mechanisms, and&#13;
   actions are taken to correct deficiencies identified. Management believes that internal controls&#13;
   for external financial reporting, which are subject to scrutiny by management and the internal&#13;
   auditors, and are revised as considered necessary, support the integrity and reliability of the&#13;
   external financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
   There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the&#13;
   possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even&#13;
   effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial&#13;
   statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal&#13;
   control may vary over time.&#13;
&#13;
   IBRD assessed its internal control over external financial reporting for financid presentations in&#13;
   conformity with both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America&#13;
   and International Financial Reporting Standards as of June 30, 2005. This assessment was based&#13;
   on the criteria for effective internal control over external financial reporting described in Internal&#13;
   Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the&#13;
   Treadway Commission.           Based upon this assessment, management believes that IBRD&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                -2-                                  August 4,2005&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
maintained effective internal control over external financial reporting presented in conformity&#13;
with both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and&#13;
International Financial Reporting Standards, as of June 30, 2005. The independent accounting&#13;
firm that audited the financial statements has issued an attestation report on Management's&#13;
assessment of IBRD's internal control over external financial reporting.&#13;
&#13;
The Board of Executive Directors of IBRD has appointed an Audit Committee responsible for&#13;
monitoring the accounting practices and internal controls of IBRD. The Audit Committee is&#13;
comprised entirely of Executive Directors who are independent of IBRD's management. The&#13;
Audit Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board of Executive Directors the&#13;
selection of independent auditors. It meets periodically with management, the independent&#13;
auditors, and the internal auditors to ensure that they are carrying out their responsibilities. The&#13;
Audit Committee is responsible for performing an oversight role by reviewing and monitoring&#13;
the financial, accounting and auditing procedures of IBRD in addition to reviewing IBRD's&#13;
reports. The independent auditors and the internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit&#13;
Committee, with or without the presence of management, to discuss the adequacy of internal&#13;
control over external financial reporting and any other matters which they believe should be&#13;
brought to the attention of the Audit Committee.&#13;

INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
President and Board of Governors&#13;
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#13;
&#13;
We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying Management S Report&#13;
Regarding Effectiveness of Internal Controls over External Financial Reporting, that the&#13;
International Bank of Reconstruction and Development maintained effective internal control over&#13;
external financial reporting presented in conformity with both accounting principles generally&#13;
accepted in the United States of America and International Financial Reporting Standards as of&#13;
June 30,2005, based on the criteria established in "Internal Control-Integrated Framework"&#13;
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO&#13;
report). Management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over external&#13;
financial reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion based&#13;
on our examination.&#13;
&#13;
Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the&#13;
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included obtaining an&#13;
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, testing, and evaluating the design and&#13;
operating effectiveness of the internal control, and performing such other procedures as we&#13;
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination provides a&#13;
reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
&#13;
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over external financial reporting, including&#13;
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements&#13;
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the&#13;
effectiveness of the internal control over external financial reporting to future periods are subject&#13;
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the&#13;
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.&#13;
&#13;
In our opinion, management's assertion that the International Bank for Reconstruction and&#13;
Development maintained effective internal control over external financial reporting presented in&#13;
conformity with both accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America&#13;
and International Financial Reporting Standards as of June 30,2005, is fairly stated, in all&#13;
material respects, based on the criteria established in "Internal Control - Integrated Framework"&#13;
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.&#13;

&#13;
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of&#13;
America and International Standards on Auditing. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit&#13;
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An&#13;
audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial&#13;
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made&#13;
by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that our&#13;
audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
&#13;
In our opinion, such financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the&#13;
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development as of June 30,2005 and 2004, and the results of its&#13;
operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended June 30,2005 in&#13;
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America and International&#13;
Financial Reporting Standards.&#13;

estimated cost of replacing these contracts on that      carrying value of debt issuance costs being included in&#13;

&#13;
    The management of the International Development Association (IDA) is responsible for, the&#13;
    preparation, integrity, and fair presentation of its published special purpose financial statements&#13;
    and all other information presented in this annual report.            The special purpose financial&#13;
    statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles described in Note A to&#13;
    IDA's special purpose financial statements and, as such, include amounts based on informed&#13;
    judgments and estimates made by management.&#13;
&#13;
   The special purpose financial statements have been audited by an independent accounting firm,&#13;
    which was given unrestricted access to all financial records and related data, including minutes of&#13;
   all meetings of the Board of Executive Directors and committees of the Board. Management&#13;
    believes that all representations made to the independent auditors during their audit were valid&#13;
   and appropriate. The independent auditors' report accompanies the audited special purpose&#13;
   financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
   Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over&#13;
   external financial reporting for financial presentations in conformity with accounting principles&#13;
   described in Note A to IDA's special purpose financial statements. The system of internal&#13;
   control contains monitoring mechanisms, and actions are taken to correct deficiencies identified.&#13;
   Management believes that internal controls for external financial reporting, which are subject to&#13;
   scrutiny by management and the internal auditors, and are revised as considered necessary,&#13;
   support the integrity and reliability of the external financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
   There are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any internal control, including the&#13;
   possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls. Accordingly, even&#13;
   effective internal control can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial&#13;
   statement preparation. Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness of internal&#13;
   control may vary over time.&#13;
&#13;
   IDA assessed its internal control over external financial reporting for financial presentations in&#13;
   conformity with accounting principles described in Note A to IDA's special purpose financial&#13;
   statements as of June 30, 2005. This assessment was based on the criteria for effective internal&#13;
   control over external financial reporting described in Internal Control-Integrated Framework&#13;
   issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based&#13;
   upon this assessment, management believes that IDA maintained effective internal control over&#13;
   external financial reporting presented in conformity with accounting principles described in Note&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

A to IDA's special purpose financial statements, as of June 30, 2005.              The independent&#13;
accounting firm that audited the special purpose financial statements has issued an attestation&#13;
report on Management's assessment of IDA's internal control over external financial reporting.&#13;
&#13;
The Board of Executive Directors of IDA has appointed an Audit Committee responsible for&#13;
monitoring the accounting practices and internal controls of IDA. The Audit Committee is&#13;
comprised entirely of Executive Directors who are independent of IDA's management. The&#13;
Audit Committee is responsible for recommending to the Board of Executive Directors the&#13;
selection of independent auditors. It meets periodically with management, the independent&#13;
auditors, and the internal auditors to ensure that they are carrying out their responsibilities. The&#13;
Audit Committee is responsible for performing an oversight role by reviewing and monitoring&#13;
the financial, accounting and auditing procedures of IDA in addition to reviewingIDA's reports.&#13;
The independent auditors and the internal auditors have full and free access to the Audit&#13;
Committee, with or without the presence of management, to discuss the adequacy of internal&#13;
control over external financial reporting and any other matters which they believe should be&#13;
brought to the attention of the Audit Committee.&#13;

INDEPENDENT ACCOUNTANTS' REPORT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
President and Board of Governors&#13;
International Development Association&#13;
&#13;
We have examined management's assertion, included in the accompanying Management's Report&#13;
Regarding Effectiveness of Internal Controls over External Financial Reporting, that the&#13;
International Development Association maintained effective internal control over external&#13;
financial reporting presented in conformity with the accounting principles described in Note A to&#13;
the International Development Association's special purpose financial statements as of June 30,&#13;
2005, based on the criteria established in "Internal Control-Integrated Framework" issued by the&#13;
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (the COSO report).&#13;
Management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over external financial&#13;
reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on management's assertion based on our&#13;
examination.&#13;
&#13;
Our examination was conducted in accordance with attestation standards established by the&#13;
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants and, accordingly, included obtaining an&#13;
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, testing, and evaluating the design and&#13;
operating effectiveness of the internal control, and performing such other procedures as we&#13;
considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our examination provides a&#13;
reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
&#13;
Because of the inherent limitations of internal control over external financial reporting, including&#13;
the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements&#13;
due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Also, projections of any evaluation of the&#13;
effectiveness of the internal control over external financial reporting to future periods are subject&#13;
to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the&#13;
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.&#13;
&#13;
In our opinion, management's assertion that International Development Association maintained&#13;
effective internal control over external financial reporting presented in conformity with the&#13;
accounting principles described in Note A to the International Development Association's special&#13;
purpose financial statements as of June 30,2005, is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on&#13;
the criteria established in "Internal Control- Integrated Framework" issued by the Committee of&#13;
Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.&#13;

International Development Association&#13;
&#13;
We have audited the accompanying special purpose statement of sources and applications of development&#13;
resources of the International Development Association as of June 30,2005 and 2004, including the&#13;
summary statement of development credits and statement of voting power and subscriptions and&#13;
contributions as of June 30,2005 and the related special purpose statements of income, comprehensive&#13;
income, changes in accumulated deficit, and cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended&#13;
June 30,2005. These special purpose financial statements are the responsibility of the International&#13;
Development Association's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these special&#13;
purpose financial statements based on our audits.&#13;
&#13;
We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of&#13;
America. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about&#13;
whether the special purpose financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes&#13;
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the special purpose financial&#13;
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made&#13;
by management, as well as evaluating the overall special purpose financial statement presentation. We&#13;
believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.&#13;
&#13;
The accompanying special purpose financial statements were prepared to reflect the sources and applications&#13;
of development resources, operations, and cash flows of the International Development Association to&#13;
comply with Article VI, Section 11 (a) of the Articles of Agreement of the International Development&#13;
Association, as discussed in Note A to the special purpose financial statements, and are not intended to be a&#13;
presentation in conformity with the accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America&#13;
or International Financial Reporting Standards.&#13;
&#13;
In our opinion, such special purpose financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material&#13;
respects, the sources and applications of development resources of the International Development&#13;
Association as of June 30,2005 and 2004, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the&#13;
three fiscal years in the period ended June 30,2005 in conformity with the accounting principles described in&#13;
Note A to the special purpose financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
Our audits were conducted for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the basic special purpose financial&#13;
statements taken as a whole. The Supplementary Information on the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Debt&#13;
Initiative listed in the table of contents is presented for the purpose of additional analysis. This additional&#13;
information is the responsibility of the International Development Association's management. Such&#13;
information has been subjected to the auditing procedures applied in our audits of the basic special purpose&#13;
financial statements.&#13;
&#13;
This report is intended solely for the information and use of the Board of Governors, management, and&#13;
members of the International Development Association. However, under the International Development&#13;
Association's Articles of Agreement, this report is a matter of public record and its distribution is not limited.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This World Bank Annual Report highlights
            the focus of the Bank activities in addressing worldwide
            poverty, describing the Bank work in promoting sustainable,
            economic growth, and in channeling needed services to poor
            people. Also detailed is the Bank's work toward
            achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs); its
            institutional and global efforts toward effective
            development; and, its outreach to clients through Public
            Information Centers, and on the Web. Regional Perspectives
            are reviewed, through a breakdown of the Bank's lending
            and activities across the developing world, featuring
            highlights of projects in borrowing countries within each of
            the Bank's six regions. The Summary of Fiscal Year
            Activities provides a description of the Bank's
            development knowledge-sharing over the fiscal year 2005; a
            discussion of the Bank's approach to lending in low
            income, and middle-income countries; the Bank's
            resources; and a summary of the Bank's lending by
            region, theme, and sector, such as environmental programs
            and infrastructure projects. This section also describes the
            Bank's partnerships with public, private, and civil
            society stakeholders. The fiscal 2005 financial statements,
            organizational information, income by region, new operations
            approved in fiscal 2005, and various lending data are
            included on a CD inserted inside the back cover of this report.
