1.1    The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in this&#13;
Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;
under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement shall be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any&#13;
applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2    Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time, including&#13;
its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to prevent and&#13;
combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to finance&#13;
terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the Security&#13;
Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this&#13;
provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws,&#13;
regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be kept&#13;
separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be commingled&#13;
with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee, has legal title to the&#13;
funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States dollars (the "Holding&#13;
Currency").&#13;
2.3    Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their respective&#13;
Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency other than the Holding&#13;
Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions, the Bank&#13;
shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date&#13;
of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of exchange rate&#13;
fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any additional&#13;
financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies as&#13;
may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion.&#13;
2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their disbursement&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of trust funds administered&#13;
by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment to the Trust Fund to be used for the same&#13;
purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿3.     Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
3.1    The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each Installment, an amount&#13;
equal to two percent (2%) per Installment as an administrative fee for the Trust Fund.&#13;
3.2    In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for program management and Trust&#13;
Fund administration, that are (i) not covered by the percentage deduction specified above as an administrative&#13;
fee and (ii) not included under Annex I of the Administration Agreements in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
applicable policies and procedures shall be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis up to a maximum of&#13;
four and 53/100 percent (4.53%) of the total Contributions under all Administration Agreements.&#13;
3.3    Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust Fund Fees&#13;
and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual Contributions significantly&#13;
differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first Administration Agreement, or&#13;
if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right to request a change&#13;
to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by amendments made to&#13;
the Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable to all new&#13;
Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement existing Administration Agreements or&#13;
from new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
4.     Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;

of internal control over cash-based financial reporting for all cash-based trust funds as a whole; and (ii) a&#13;
combined financial statement for all cash-based trust funds together with the Bank's external auditor's opinion&#13;
thereon. The cost of the single audit shall be borne by the Bank.&#13;
4.4    If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the Bank's external&#13;
auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether such an external audit is&#13;
necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope and terms of reference of such audit.&#13;
Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange for such external audit. The&#13;
costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of the Bank with respect to such audit, shall be borne by&#13;
the requesting Donor.&#13;

of such review or evaluation, and the Bank shall provide all relevant information within the limits of the Bank's&#13;
applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including any costs incurred by the Bank, shall be&#13;
borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review or evaluation will not constitute a financial,&#13;

6.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the Bank by June&#13;
