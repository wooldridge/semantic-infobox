&#13;
                                       1        In the competitive power markets seen in Europe and much of the Americas, multiple private utilities compete with each other (and&#13;
                                                sometimes with state-owned or controlled utilities) to supply power directly to customers. The goal of competition is to provide&#13;
                                                incentives to reduce long-term power costs and align services with customer needs. Competition in power, however, typically&#13;
                                                requires a total reform of the sector and unbundling of services along the supply chain, and functions best in countries with&#13;
                                                excess supply and the technical capacity to operate a sophisticated power market. In contrast, APS models are limited in scope,&#13;
                                                directly address a shortage or absence of supply, and can be implemented with a small number of targeted policies or regulations.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Unreliable electricity supply hinders
            economic growth in low-income countries. The private sector
            can play a significant role in supporting national power
            goals through small-scale &#145;alternative private supply of
            power,&#146; or APS. A World Bank Group report found that certain
            APS models may provide the most cost-effective way of
            supplying power, and in many cases prove a more practical
            way of increasing access to reliable electricity. This note
            discusses the models of APS, the conditions when each is
            appropriate, and the financial and regulatory support that
            can attract investment for these projects.
