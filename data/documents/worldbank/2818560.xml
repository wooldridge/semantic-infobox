     worsened by the recent civil conflict. Progress in implementingthe credit has been impressivein&#13;
     light of the severe civil strifeof October 2003, which brought most governmentprogramsto a&#13;
     standstill, and the subsequentchange of Governmentwhich resulted in new leadershipfor all&#13;

&#13;
1.       The US $35million (SDR 25.4 million) Social SafetyNet StructuralAdjustment&#13;
Credit (SSNSAC) for Bolivia was approvedby the Board on June 17,2003;the Credit&#13;
Agreement was declared effectiveon June 26,2003; the First Tranche of US $25 million&#13;
was released on June 27,2003 with all tranche criteriamet. The closing date of this&#13;
project is June 30,2004. Conditions for the secondtranche release are specified in&#13;
Schedule3 to the Credit Agreement, and are detailed in the Letter of DevelopmentPolicy&#13;

        Thismemorandum,after a summary of social and economicevents that have&#13;
implementingthe actionsnecessaryto meet specific conditionsfor the release of the&#13;
Second Tranche. Progresshas been impressivein light of the severe civil strife of&#13;
October 2003, which brought most governmentprograms to a standstill, and the ensuing&#13;
change of Governmentwhich resulted in new leadershipfor all governmententities and a&#13;
reorganizationof functionsamongthem. Governmentremains on track for achievement&#13;
of five of the six conditions before the closingdate of the credit. Budget Execution&#13;
targets for nine socialprograms, the first condition, are unlikely to be met due to the&#13;
exceptionalcircumstancesthat occurred late in the fiscal year: a sharp declinein&#13;
Governmentrevenues; the near paralysis of governmentbefore and after the civil strife;&#13;
and the suddenresignationof the previous administration and the installation of its&#13;
successor.&#13;
&#13;
3.      The new Governmentis seeking an earlierthan anticipateddisbursementof the&#13;
Second Tranche, to help it respond to urgent socialneeds and deepening fiscalpressures,&#13;
both of which have been worsenedby the recent civil conflict. A full waiver for&#13;
condition 1in Schedule 3 (BudgetExecution) is sought on the grounds set forth in&#13;
paragraphs 9 and 10. A partial waiver is requested for condition 3 (progress report on&#13;
Impact Evaluation) based on groundsthat the ImpactEvaluationwas planned to begin&#13;
early next year, as set forth in paragraph 15. A full waiver is sought for condition6&#13;
(Education Sector Strategypresented to National Education Congress)on the grounds&#13;
that the civil strifeled to a postponement of the Conferenceuntil March next year, as set&#13;
forth in paragraph 22.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I.      Economic and Social Conditions in Bolivia and the Government's Social&#13;
Safety Net Program&#13;
&#13;
4.      Bolivia has endurednearly 5 years of economic stagnation and negative per capita&#13;
income growth, due to exogenous shocks that held back growth in key sectors, such as&#13;
the regional crisis in Brazil and Argentina that sharply reduced exports and remittances.&#13;
Internally, the essential policy to eradicate coca production has impacted rural incomes.&#13;
Equally important in explainingthe poor growth outcomes has been the growing tension&#13;
and social unrest, pushed by         economic stagnation, increasing poverty and rising&#13;
unemployment. An escalating trend of social unrest emerged - with serious conflicts in&#13;
April 2000, September/October 2000, January 2002 and February 2003. The latter&#13;
episode involved over 30 deaths in La Paz and undermined the admmistration of&#13;
President Sanchez de Lozada, who survived the February events, but in a weakened&#13;
political position.   Protests and civil strife resumed in September and culminated in&#13;
October 2003 with violent clashes between the Government and various groups manning&#13;
road blocks around the capital, La Paz, and other cities. President Sanchez de Lozada&#13;
was compelled to resign in late October, and the Vice President, Carlos Mesa, assumed&#13;
constitutionallymandated leadership of the country.&#13;
5.      President Mesa has put in motion both a political and economic calendar of key&#13;
initiatives and priorities. First, he has proposed a new Hydrocarbons Law, with the aim&#13;
of raising the effectivetax contribution of the oil and gas companies currently operating&#13;
in Bolivia to levels more consistent with internationalpractice. Oncethis Law is enacted,&#13;
the President believes chances for a successful outcome of a gas project referendum, his&#13;
second priority, will be high. The referendum could take place in the second quarter of&#13;
2004. The third priority on the President's agenda is to call for a Constitutional&#13;
Assembly. While the assembly was initially proposed as a way to codify the rights of&#13;
indigenous peoples, it will by definition have unlimited powers. It could, for instance,&#13;
give Bolivia a new federalist charter and establish mechanisms for revenue sharing across&#13;
regions. On the economic front, he has committed to restoring macro stability and&#13;
economic progress and has sought and received support from the international&#13;
community; he will launch a special program of micro investments and services in&#13;
&#13;
Although these steps represent a strong policy stance and are receiving strong&#13;
socially unstable areas, such as El Alto; and he will launch an anti coxruption program.&#13;
international support, the present stability in Bolivia is uncertain and fragile. The social&#13;
and economic tensions that have driven civil unrest in 2003 remain, and the opposition&#13;
has been strengthened as a result of the October events.&#13;
6.      In regard to the social safety net program, both the last and current&#13;
administrationshave pursued a strengthened safety net as a central element of their crisis&#13;
response strategy.      Two objectives have guided resource allocation and policy&#13;
development. First, key social programs in health, education and social protection have&#13;
been protected from budget cuts and have been designed to serve as counter cyclical&#13;
government interventions. This effort is readily evident in PLANE (National Plan for&#13;
Emergency Employment), the Government'spremier safety net program, which provides&#13;
short term employment to the poor in maintenance and repair activities utilizing low and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
unskilled workers. The present administration is preparing a program of investment in&#13;
high povertyhigh unemployment areas such as El Alto, in which PLANE is expected to&#13;
play a prominent role. In the health sector, the government's universal health insurance&#13;
program, SUMI (UniversalMother and Child Insurance), and the national disease control&#13;
programs have been the lead vehicles to ensure that the poor retain access and actually&#13;
use health services during the crisis period. Two education reform programs have been&#13;
protected so that education services are sustained.        The second element of the&#13;
Government's safety net program is the improvement of safety net programs through&#13;
specific policy changes to help direct interventionsto the poor. These changes include,&#13;
for example, the just introducedprogram to reimburse the poor in rural areas for travel to&#13;
remote health facilities to receive emergency care. For PLANE 11, the changes have&#13;
included more transparency in the monitoring of the program through regular donor&#13;
group reports, external evaluations, independent audits, and increased municipal&#13;
accountabilityfor the identificationand selectionof subprojects.&#13;
&#13;
II.    Achievementof the First Tranche Conditions&#13;
&#13;
7.     As part of the fust tranche of this program, the Bolivian Government (under the&#13;
previous administration)took severalkey measures that strengthenedits social safety net.&#13;
A summary description of the actionstaken prior to presentation of the loan to the Bank's&#13;
Board on May 19,2003 is presented below.&#13;
&#13;
    0  The 2003 budget was approvedwith US$ 106million provided for protected&#13;
       social programs, a 3% increasefrom 2002 budget execution. Workfare, health and&#13;
       educationbasic services,and reform projects were protected with amounts&#13;
       enough to maintain coverageand quality of servicesand, in some cases, scale-up&#13;
       reform activities. In this way, even though the fiscal problemswere worsening,&#13;
       the Government sent apowerful signal of its decisionto protect fundamental&#13;
       social expenditures.&#13;
       Reconsidering a previous decisionto shut down PLANE, the workfareprogram,&#13;
       the'Governmentdecided to launch a second-phase (PLANE 11).A budget of US$&#13;
       25 million was included for this purpose. The Governmentselected a new&#13;
       administrator(UNDP) as well as other organizationsto register and assign labor&#13;
       and to superviseprojects. The registration of workers and call for local sub-&#13;
       projects began in late March 2003,&#13;
       In health, the Governmenttook measures for improvingequityand efficiencyby:&#13;
       (i) reformingits non-contributory public insurance scheme with an ambitious&#13;
       policy of universal coverage for children and mothers (SUMI); (ii) maintaining&#13;
       and improvingperformanceagreementswith departmental health services; and&#13;
       (iii) approvinga Bill of Rights of the Pregnant Woman that focuses on the rights&#13;
       of indigenouswomen to have culturally adapted delivery services.&#13;
       In education,the Governmentprotected expendituresof the EducationReform&#13;
       Program and presented a plan to conductpublic consultationson a Strategic&#13;
       Sector Plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
111.    Actions Taken to Fulfill the Second TrancheRelease Conditions&#13;
&#13;
8.      This sectionpresentsthe actionstaken to fulfillthe SecondTranche conditionsas&#13;
set out in Schedule3 of the CreditAgreement. Of the 6 conditions for the Release of&#13;
the SecondTranche, only the first condition (Budget Execution)will be difficultto attain&#13;
withinthe project period. A severe decline in Governmentrevenues, the near paralysis of&#13;
government before and after the civil strife, and resignationof the former administration&#13;
and the installation of a completelynew team has slowed government execution late in&#13;
the fiscal year, from which a full recovery is unlikely. A full waiver is sought for this&#13;
&#13;
period. To respond to the Government'surgent need for supportbefore the end of the&#13;
condition. The other five policy actions are all on track for compliance withinthe project&#13;
calendaryear, a waiver of condition6 and partial waiver of condition3 are sought&#13;
because the relevant actions,due to technicalconsiderations, cannotbe accelerated into&#13;
compliance this year. The grounds for the waiver requests are discussedin detail in the&#13;
sectionsthat follow.&#13;
&#13;
A.      Budget Protection&#13;
&#13;
    Schedule 3, Section 1: Evidence has been presented to the Association of the&#13;
    satisfactory execution of the budgets for seven of the followingnine programs, at the&#13;
    followinglevels of execution,and of the satisfactoryexecutionof 85% or more of the&#13;
    total appropriation, as listed in paragraph 2 of Schedule 2 to this Agreement, all in&#13;
    form and subshce acceptable to the Association:&#13;
&#13;
                    PLANE 11: 100%of US$25 million equivalent;&#13;
                    Health reform: 80% of US$14.76 million equivalent;&#13;
                    Epidemiological shield for Chagas: 80% of US$5.85 million&#13;
                    equivalent;&#13;
                    Epidemiological shield for Malaria: 75% US$0.74 million equivalent;&#13;
                    Epidemiological shield for Tuberculosis: 85% of US$0.64 million&#13;
                    equivalent;&#13;
                    Universal mother-child insurance: 75% of US$l 1.60 million&#13;
                    equivalent;&#13;
                    Extended immunization: 95% of US$4.02 million equivalent;&#13;
                    Education reform: 75% of US$25.40 million equivalent;and&#13;
                    Education quality: 100%of USl8.81 million equivalent.&#13;
&#13;
9.     This conditionhas not been met and a waiver is soueht. The budget execution&#13;
floors containedin the first condition were agreed based on historical data on budget&#13;
expenditureresults, and thus assumed an averageperformance in a year (2003)that had&#13;
alreadybegun under unusual circumstances-a long delay inthe approval of the budget&#13;
(April2003) and a first round of civil conflictin February. However, the historical data&#13;
showed clearlythat in nearly all of the nine programs, expenditureswere heavily back&#13;
loaded in the last quarter of the calendar year. This provided confidencethat the targets&#13;
could be attained, and a formulawas agreed that provided for a limited measure of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
flexibility, so that shortfalls in one or two of the nine programs would not imperil the&#13;
entire program. It was not assumedthat the governmentwould be paralyzed by a&#13;
prolonged and severe episode of unrest combinedwith a changein government. Those&#13;
events in fact did occw in the last quarter,the effects of which are still being felt in the&#13;
form of newly appointed Ministers and their management teams, some of whom have&#13;
had little experience in managingtheir programs.&#13;
&#13;
10.     A supervision mission in earlyNovember determinedthat execution levels had&#13;
&#13;
two monthsto reach the agreed target of 85% execution. Detailed assessments ofthe&#13;
attained an overalllevel of 60% of the protected budgets as of October 2003, leaving only&#13;
spendingrates for eachprogramwere prepared, and the mission concludedwith the&#13;
Government that the end of year outcomeprobably would not surpass 77%. Under the&#13;
circumstances,this expectedresult would represent a successful adaptationto challenging&#13;
circumstances, and the mission concluded that the result was fully consistent with the&#13;
intent of the target and ajustifiable outcome. Nonetheless, a waiver is required for the&#13;
disbursementof the Second Tranche.&#13;
&#13;
B.      Social Protectionand Welfare&#13;
&#13;
    Schedule 3, Section 2. the Directorio Unico de Fondos (DUF) has submitted to the&#13;
    Association a report on the implementation of PLANE 11, confirming the generation&#13;
    during calendar year 2003 of a minimum of 300,000 temporary employments of a&#13;
    one-month duration,in form and substanceacceptableto the Association.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
has progressed well, beginning slowly as a newly recruited Administrator of the program&#13;
11.     This condition has been met. The implementation of the second year of PLANE&#13;
W P ) installed new procedures and launched the process of community generation of&#13;
sub project proposals for municipal consideration. The number of monthly contracted&#13;
workers rose graduallyto the current plateau of 70,000 per month. As of October, the&#13;
Administrator reported that 240,000 man months of employment had been contracted.&#13;
month in advance. Bank supervision of the works, as well as by the bilateral donors to&#13;
By end November the number reached 301,398, thus meeting the annual target one&#13;
the program, has shown overall quality of the maintenance activities to be above average&#13;
and the apparent targeting to the poorest segments of the labor force successful, through&#13;
payment of the below market unskilled labor wage and the regional allocation of PLANE&#13;
I1resourcesfollowing a poverty map.&#13;
&#13;
12.&#13;
November 27, 2003 from the Manager of the UNDP team administering PLANE I1 and&#13;
        Evidence received by the Bank in compliance with this condition is a letter dated&#13;
an interimprogressreport attestingto the attainment of the man month target.&#13;
&#13;
    Schedule 3, Section 3. The Directorio Unico de Fondos (DUF) has presented to the&#13;
   Association (a) terms of reference for the evaluationof program impact of PLANE 11,&#13;
    setting out objectives, scope, and methodology; (b) a progress report on impact&#13;
   evaluation, describing steps taken, information obtained, and preliminary findings;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    and (c) a signed contract for the audit of PLANE I1 financial operations, all in form&#13;
    and substanceacceptable to the Association.&#13;
&#13;
13.     The sub-condition(a) has been met. Sub condition (a) was agreed as a necessary&#13;
followup to the more limited scope evaluationof PLANE I, which focused on poverty&#13;
and employment impactobjectives. The evaluation of PLANE I1is designed to include&#13;
impact as well as an institutionalevaluationfocusingon such issues as project selection&#13;
processes at the municipal level, worker recruitment and payment procedures,and the&#13;
role of the external supervisors. Thetwo terms of reference are well conceivedand&#13;
drafted. Two separatecontractorsfor the two distinct activitieswill be selected by the&#13;
PLANE I1administrator (householdsurvey and impact analysis;institutionaland&#13;
managerial evaluation).&#13;
&#13;

        (ii)   "Termsof Reference for an External Evaluationof PLANE 11"&#13;
&#13;
15.     Sub conditionr0)has not been met and a waiver is sought. The required&#13;
preliminary report fromthe evaluationcontractors was anticipatedin 2004, giventhe&#13;
time required to draft TOR,recruit contractorsto conductthe household survey and&#13;
interviewsof the entitiesinvolved in implementingthe program, and to obtain&#13;
preliminary results. TheAdministrator of PLANE I1is on track with preparation of the&#13;
&#13;
with the conditionwithinthe project period. However, it will not be possible to deliver&#13;
terms of reference and plans are firmto contract for the two evaluations and to comply&#13;
the preliminary report in December, and for this reason a waiver of sub condition (b) is&#13;
sought.&#13;
&#13;
16.     Sub-condition(c)has been met. The DUF with support from bilateral donors&#13;
supportingthe Program conducted a competitive selectionof an external auditor,&#13;
choosingPrice Waterhouse Coopersfor the contract. The signed contract complied with&#13;
the sub-condition. Implementationprogressedbeyond the contract stage. Price&#13;
Waterhouse Coopersthen conductedan interim financialaudit of the first 8 months of&#13;
PLANE I1operations,includingfield visitsto 70 subprojects. The audit report was&#13;
submittedto DUF, which in turn distributedthe report to a donor consultationmeeting in&#13;
earlyNovember. Thereport was unqualifiedin all respectswith the exception of a&#13;
findingthat the Ministry of Finance had not identifiedthe source (national funds,or&#13;
donor, or international financial institutionfunds) of the transferred fundsto PLANE.&#13;
This external issue is being addressed,within the limits of the Government'saccounting&#13;
system. A follow up final audit of PLANE I1will be conductedby Price Waterhouse&#13;
Coopersunder the same contract.&#13;

18.     This condition has been met. TheNational Social and EconomicFund (FPS) is&#13;
responsiblefor channeling long term investmentresourcesto municipalities, and serves&#13;
as the subproject mechanismfor severaldonor investmentprograms implemented at the&#13;
municipal level. Its role is distinct from the short term crisisresponse activities&#13;
supportedby PLANE 11,which like FPS is housed withinthe DUF. FPS agreedto&#13;
examineits operationsfor opportunitiesto supportthe employmentobjectivesof the&#13;
Governmentduring the crisis, while preserving its long term investment functionality.&#13;
The report on options for financing of labor-intensiveprojects recently submittedas&#13;
evidence of compliance is the result of those deliberations. The report proposes two&#13;
adaptationsfor labor intensive programs in FPS, the first a temporary substitutionof&#13;
labor intensive methods for machine based construction activities. The second is the&#13;
introduction of a new program to institutionalize road maintenance, based on a micro&#13;
enterpriseprogram of road maintenance firms composed of poor rural and urban workers,&#13;
based on other suchprograms in Peru and Colombia. Implementation of these proposals&#13;
will require broad consultation and further design efforts, in particular the second&#13;
proposal. However, the report and its proposals are sufficientto comply with the&#13;
condition.&#13;

C. Health SectorReform&#13;
&#13;
    Schedule 3, Section 5. The Borrower's Ministry in charge of health has issued a&#13;
    regulation setting forth procedures by which SUMI may reimburse transportation&#13;
    costs incurred by the rural poor in accessing secondary and tertiary health care, in&#13;
    form and substanceacceptableto the Association.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Resolution allowing municipalities to use SUMI funds to reimburse for travel costs in&#13;
20.     This condition has been met. The Ministry of Health has approved a Ministerial&#13;
&#13;
case of emergencies. Returning trips can also be reimbursed. Emergencies are broadly&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
defined, including any circumstances in which it can be considered that life is at stake,&#13;
including normal deliveries in locations where these services are not available at local&#13;
health centers. Only terrestrial and fluvial transport are considered, as airplane costs are&#13;
considered to be too high. The decision to reimburse these costs is left to municipalities&#13;
as they administer SUMI funds, and as knowledge of service capacity in health networks&#13;
is much greater at local levels. Municipalities are also in charge of approvingthe travel&#13;
reimbursement fees and of the administrative procedures. The reimbursement of travel&#13;
costs has not only been approved but is already working, thus exceeding the formal&#13;
condition. A monitoring of SUMI reimbursements for 5 months shows that 61&#13;
municipalities(of a total of 314)have effectivelyreimbursed travel costs.&#13;
&#13;
21.     The evidence received by the Bank in compliancewith the condition in Section 5&#13;
consists of the followingdocuments:&#13;
    (i)     Ministry of Health and Social Security,"MinisterialResolution No. 0244'', 12&#13;
            May 2003, establishing the payment of emergency transportation costs to&#13;
            public health facilities;&#13;
    (ii)    Ministry of Health and Social Security,"MinisterialResolution No. 0351",27&#13;
            June 2003, declaring the above program of transportation cost payments in&#13;
           force as of July 1.&#13;
&#13;
D. EducationSectorReform&#13;
&#13;
    Schedule3, Section6. The Borrower has presented to the Association evidence, inthe&#13;
    form of a copy of a transmittal letter signed by the Borrower's Minister in charge of&#13;
    education, that the draft of the strategic sector plan for education, referred to in&#13;
    paragraph 10 of Schedule2 of this Agreement, has been presented to the Borrower's&#13;
    National Congress of Education for its consideration and in form and substance&#13;
    acceptableto the Association.&#13;
&#13;
22.     This condition has not been met and a waiver is sought. The Government has&#13;
produced a draft of the strategic sector plan for education, which has been consulted in&#13;
departmentalforums.As a result ofthis process, a revised strategicplan for educationhas&#13;
been produced by the Ministry of Education and has been submitted to the Bank. A&#13;
study on primary school dropouts, which was intended to inform the strategy (not an&#13;
explicit condition), has been completed, and its results are incorporated in the draft&#13;
StrategicPlan. However, the October events, among others, led to the National Congress&#13;
of Education being delayed. The Congress is now being prepared for March, and a draft&#13;
Supreme Decree calling for the Congress has been prepared. The new version of the&#13;
Strategic Plan for Education will be sent to the participants to the National Congress of&#13;
Education in mid-December. Even if the condition as initially proposed has not been met,&#13;
the Government, in the middle of a very difficult social crisis, has produced a draft&#13;
strategic plan, has made extensive consultations of the plan and is taking action to&#13;
prepare for the National Congress of Education in March, at which the Strategic Plan&#13;
will be presented, all within the project period, but not timed to comply with an&#13;
accelerated secondtranche release.&#13;

            Bolivia - Social Safety Net Structural
            Adjustment Credit : Release of the second tranche, partial
            waiver of one condition, and full waiver of two conditions
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This release of the second tranche of
            the Social Safety Net Structural Adjustment Credit Project
            will support the Government of Bolivia to help it respond to
            urgent social needs and deepening fiscal pressures, both of
            which have been worsened by the recent civil conflict.
            Progress in implementing the credit has been impressive in
            light of the severe civil strife of October 2003, which
            brought most government programs to a standstill, and the
            subsequent change of Government which resulted in new
            leadership for all government entities and a reorganization
            of functions among them.  The Government remains on track
            for achievement of five of the six conditions before the
            closing date of the credit. A fill waiver for the budget
            execution condition is sought as the expected result will be
            a successful adaptation to challenging circumstances, and
            fully consistent with the intent of the target.  A partial
            waiver is requested for the progress report on impact
            evaluation condition as the impact evaluation is planned to
            begin early 2004.  A full waiver is also sought for the
            Education Sector Strategy to be presented to National
            Education Congress on the grounds that the civil strife led
            to a postponement of the Conference until March 2004.
