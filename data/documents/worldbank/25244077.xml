&amp;#12;    World Bank Group and World Bank&#13;
    Corporate Scorecards&#13;
    In July 2013, the World Bank Group launched its Strategy, outlining how it will partner more&#13;
    effectively with clients to help them achieve the ambitious goals of eradicating extreme&#13;
    poverty and boosting shared prosperity through economic growth, inclusion, sustainability&#13;
    and resilience. In April 2014, the World Bank Group Corporate Scorecard was launched for the&#13;
    first time and the World Bank Scorecard revised to monitor the implementation of the Strategy.&#13;
&#13;
    The World Bank Group Scorecard provides view of the results and performance indicators&#13;
    of the three World Bank Group institutions: the World Bank (WB), the International Finance&#13;
    Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA). This brochure&#13;
    presents the Scorecards, updated with the latest data available in fiscal year 2015.&#13;

&#13;
                          Development Context&#13;
                Tier 1    Reports the long-term development outcomes that countries are&#13;
                          achieving&#13;
&#13;
                          Client Results&#13;
                Tier 2    Reflects the results reported by clients implementing operations&#13;
                          supported by the World Bank Group&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                          Performance&#13;
                Tier 3&#13;
                          Covers operational and organizational effectiveness&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                          Complemented by institutional scorecards for WB, IFC, and MIGA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The Scorecards are structured in three tiers. Tiers 1 and 2 present indicators monitoring aspects&#13;
    of growth, inclusiveness, and sustainability and resilience. Tier 3 captures the progress in&#13;
    implementing the World Bank Group Strategy and includes measures of both operational and&#13;
    organizational effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
    The World Bank Group Strategy gives special attention to gender issues and to the needs of&#13;
    fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS). Therefore, as applicable, the Scorecardsâ&#128;&#153; indicators&#13;
    are disaggregated to show results in these two categories.&#13;
&#13;
    For each indicator, a baseline value was set when the Scorecards were first released. In addition,&#13;
    performance indicators (Tier 3) include targets and performance standards. The Scorecard&#13;
    includes a few placeholdersâ&#128;&#148;results areas for which indicators, definitions, and values had&#13;
    not yet been developed. In this yearâ&#128;&#153;s Scorecard the placeholders in Tier 3 have been replaced,&#13;
    although a few remain in Tiers 1 and 2.&#13;

                                                                                     Corporate Scorecards | October 2015&#13;
&#13;
Tier 1&#13;
&#13;
    Tier 1 reports long-term development outcomes and the broader context of countries in&#13;
    which the World Bank Group operates. Improvements in Tier 1 indicators are not attributed&#13;
    to the World Bank Group; they are the outcome of collective efforts by countries and their&#13;
    development partners.&#13;
&#13;
    Most Tier 1 indicators reflect the development context in World Bank Group client countries,&#13;
    while a few, particularly those related to climate change, have global dimensions. Consequently,&#13;
    the Tier 1 indicators for CO2 emissions and average annual deforestation change are reported not&#13;
    just for World Bank Group client countries, but for the world as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
    We expect to refine the Tier 1 indicators over time to reflect the evolving consensus on what the&#13;
    key development challenges are and how progress should be measured. Therefore, the World&#13;
    Bank Group Scorecards will be aligned with the outcomes of international dialogue such as the&#13;
    Sustainable Development Goals and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate&#13;
    Change (UNFCCC).&#13;

&amp;#12;Tier 2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Tier 2 reflects the results reported by clients supported by the World Bank Group in implementing&#13;
     operations that promote growth, inclusiveness, and sustainability and resilience. Tier 2 data in&#13;
     the Scorecards cover the stock of results achieved over fiscal years 2013-2015. It is important to&#13;
     note that, in the World Bank Group Scorecard, results reported by the World Bank are achieved&#13;
     primarily by government and other public entities. On the other hand, private sector entities&#13;
     achieve the results reported by the IFC and MIGA. MIGA now reports data in Tier 2 of the World&#13;
     Bank Group Scorecard, providing a more complete picture of results.&#13;

    Tier 3 includes measures of operational and organizational effectiveness, such as quality&#13;
    and timeliness of investments and advisory services delivered to clients; alignment with the&#13;
    Strategy; stakeholder and client feedback; internal knowledge sharing and collaboration;&#13;
    financial sustainability; and talent management. Where feasible, Tier 3 indicators have targets&#13;
    and performance standards to reinforce the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s commitment to accountability,&#13;
    provide a vision of where the institution aspires to be, and strengthen the focus on achieving&#13;
    results. Targets are set for fiscal year 2017, and progress is assessed annually.&#13;
&#13;
    This year, new indicators were developed to replace placeholders in Tier 3. This brochure reports&#13;
    data in such areas as alignment with the strategy, measure of knowledge flow, measure of joint&#13;
    engagement and staff working across institutional boundaries.&#13;

DEFINITIONS OF THE WORLD BANK GROUP AND WORLD BANK CORPORATE SCORECARD INDICATORS&#13;
Tier 1: GOALS AND DEVELOPMENT CONTEXT&#13;
Goals and Development Context are the same for the World Bank Group and the World Bank Corporate Scorecards. Data are for IBRD and&#13;
IDA countries unless otherwise indicated.&#13;
&#13;
Population living on less than US$ 1.90 (2011 PPP) a day (%): Percentage of the world population living on less than $1.90 a day at 2011&#13;
international prices. Average, weighted by the total population. Data reported for the world.&#13;
Source: World Bank staff estimates calculated using data from PovcalNet1.       Frequency: Annual (available annual data varies by country)&#13;
&#13;
Median of growth rates of average real per capita income of the bottom 40% (%): Median, across all client countries, of growth rates of&#13;
average real per capita income of the bottom 40% of every countryâ&#128;&#153;s population. The growth rate of the bottom 40% of the population of&#13;
a country for year T is the average annual growth rate measured over a period of (roughly) five years leading up to (or close to) year T.&#13;
The baseline number refers to a period that corresponds to roughly five years for every country, ending in a year between 2009 and 2013.&#13;
Data is available for 64 countries.&#13;
Source: Global database of Shared Prosperity circa 2007-2012, calculated Frequency: Annual (available annual data varies by country)&#13;
from PovcalNet.&#13;
&#13;
GDP per capita (constant 2005 US$): Gross domestic product divided by midyear population. GDP is the sum of gross value added by all&#13;
resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated&#13;
without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources.&#13;
Source: World Bank, World Development Indicators.                               Frequency: Annual&#13;
&#13;
Gross capital formation (% of GDP): Gross capital formation (formerly gross domestic investment) consists of outlays on additions to the&#13;
fixed assets of the economy plus net changes in the level of inventories. Fixed assets include land improvements (fences, ditches, drains,&#13;
etc.); plant, machinery, and equipment purchases; and the construction of roads, railways, and the like, as well as schools, offices, hospitals,&#13;
private residential dwellings, and commercial and industrial buildings. Inventories are stocks of goods held by firms to meet temporary or&#13;

Tier 2: CLIENT RESULTS SUPPORTED BY WORLD BANK GROUP/WORLD BANK OPERATIONS&#13;
The Results sections of the World Bank Group and World Bank Corporate Scorecards report results achieved by clients implementing&#13;
operations supported by the World Bank Group/World Bank. Results reported are three-year incremental results, as reported by&#13;
projects active and/ or closed during the three-year reporting period (currently fiscal years 2013-2015).&#13;
&#13;
Data are disaggregated for fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS) and for female beneficiaries where feasible. Efforts are&#13;

WORLD BANK GROUP&#13;
&#13;
The Results Tier of the World Bank Group Corporate Scorecard integrates Results from World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Investment Project Financing&#13;
(IBRD, IDA, and Recipient Executed Trust Funds), IFCâ&#128;&#153;s Investment Services (IS) and from operations supported by MIGA. The exception&#13;
is the â&#128;&#156;Countries with strengthened public management systemsâ&#128;&#157; indicator, which also includes the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s development policy&#13;
Operations and IFCâ&#128;&#153;s Advisory Services (AS). Efforts are underway to integrate more systematically the results of policy, knowledge&#13;
and advisory activities.&#13;
&#13;
When interpreting results, it is important to consider that the World Bank, IFC and MIGA operate with different instruments and work&#13;
with different clientsâ&#128;&#148;i.e. government and private sector respectively. The results reported are those achieved by these clients, with&#13;
support of the World Bank and IFC. It is also important to bear in mind that some indicators aggregate results from projects that&#13;
finance expenditures (e.g., WB projects that fund vaccinations) and projects that finance capital investments (e.g., IFC investments in&#13;
hospitals). Aggregation rules will be improved in the future to make such numbers more comparable.&#13;
&#13;
The aggregation of results across the World Bank Group has created the opportunity for the World Bank, IFC and MIGA to align their&#13;
methodologies to support accurate and meaningful results reporting. This alignment resulted in some adjustments to baseline values,&#13;
as methodologies were refined to better capture actual results.&#13;

financing or soliciting investors. Includes investment made as a result of an operation after it is completed. Private Investment Catalyzed&#13;
includes Private Capital Mobilized. For purposes of this Indicator, a private entity is one which (a) is carrying out, or is established&#13;
for, a business purpose, and is operating on a commercial basis; (b) is financially, legally, and managerially autonomous; and (c) is&#13;
not owned or managed by a government. Private Investment Catalyzed is reported in the indicator within the fiscal year when the&#13;
investment is quantifiable by the execution of the legally binding obligation (â&#128;&#156;commitmentâ&#128;&#157;) of debt financiers to the project or equity&#13;
holders invested in the client for defined business purposes; or, by the legally binding commitment of an instrument which facilitates&#13;
access to commercial financing by guaranteeing defined government payments or obligations.&#13;

Group-supported operations. Data: Fiscal years 2013-2015.&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 World Bank contribution includes the number of people who have received a new grid or off-grid electricity connection and the&#13;
    number of people that have benefitted from increased generation capacity, a proportion of whose output is reasonably estimated&#13;
    to be powering residential customers. In the future, efforts will be made to also estimate the population benefitting from the World&#13;
    Bankâ&#128;&#153;s transmission and distribution investments.&#13;
&#13;

Students reached (millions): Number of students that have benefitted from World Bank Group-financed operations. Composite&#13;
indicator of World Bank and IFC.&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Word Bank contribution includes the total number of students in all countries that benefited from World Bank-supported projects&#13;
    or activities supporting classroom assessment, examinations, national, or international assessments. The number of students&#13;
    benefiting from the assessment is calculated as the total number of students in the targeted cycle in each of the countries supported.&#13;
    The cycle refers to International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED 2011) categorization: primary, lower secondary, upper&#13;
    secondary education. The students are counted only if the Governments score 5 or higher (the highest score is 6) in the Assessment&#13;
    Rubric based on the Systems Approach for Better Education Results Framework, which measures the extent to which the country is&#13;
    utilizing the results of the assessments to enhance the quality of education. Results achieved by projects approved between fiscal&#13;
    year 2009 and 2013, as an approximation of the last 3-year results. Precise results achieved in the last three fiscal years cannot be&#13;
    determined given that studentsâ&#128;&#153; benefits accrue over time.&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 IFC counts the number of full-time equivalent (FTE) students enrolled annually in institutions receiving support from IFC. Student&#13;
    FTE represents the institutionâ&#128;&#153;s best academic judgment of the full-time equivalence of the students. The full-time equivalence of&#13;
    students on part-time courses should be established by comparison with a comparable full-time course. Part-time students should&#13;
    be returned as a proportion of an equivalent full-time course. The Student FTE of part-time study can be estimated on either a â&#128;&#152;creditâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
    or â&#128;&#152;timeâ&#128;&#153; basis. The number of student loans provided by financial institutions receiving support from IFC also counts towards the&#13;
    total number of students reached by IFC, where each loan outstanding is used as a proxy for one student.&#13;

Private sector investments catalyzed: Private investment resulting from the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s involvement in an investment, operation or non-&#13;
financing activity, measured regardless of whether or not the WBG entity was actively and directly involved in raising such financing or&#13;
soliciting investors. Includes investment made as a result of an operation after it is completed. Private Investment Catalyzed includes&#13;
Private Capital Mobilized. For purposes of this Indicator, a private entity is one which (a) is carrying out, or is established for, a business&#13;
purpose, and is operating on a commercial basis; (b) is financially, legally, and managerially autonomous; and (c) is not owned or&#13;
managed by a government. Private Investment Catalyzed is reported in the indicator within the fiscal year when the investment is&#13;
quantifiable by the execution of the legally binding obligation (â&#128;&#156;commitmentâ&#128;&#157;) of debt financiers to the project or equity holders&#13;
invested in the client for defined business purposes; or, by the legally binding commitment of an instrument which facilitates access to&#13;
commercial financing by guaranteeing defined government payments or obligations.&#13;

&#13;
Emission reductions with support of special climate instruments (annual, million tons CO2 equivalent): Annual tons CO2 equivalent&#13;
emission reductions produced with support of World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s special climate instruments. The data is calculated as sum of estimated&#13;
annual emission reductions with support of special climate finance instruments, i.e., Global Environmental Facility (GEF), Carbon&#13;
Finance (CF), Montreal protocol (MP), and Climate Investment Funds (CIFs). The numbers are calculated as follows: for GEF, MP and&#13;
CIF projects the annual equivalent figure for projects closed during the fiscal year is the expected GHG emission reduction over the&#13;
lifetime of the investments supported by these projects, divided by the lifetime of the respective investments. In the case of MP the&#13;
GHG emission reduction is achieved through the elimination of ozone-depleting substances. For CF projects, the annual equivalent&#13;
figure for Emission Reduction purchase Agreement (ERPA) approved during the fiscal year is the expected GHG emission reductions&#13;
over the time-period of the ERPA contract, divided by the time- period of the ERPA contract. This indicator is a placeholder for a broader&#13;
greenhouse gas accounting indicator, which is being developed under the WBG Corporate Scorecard (climate change mitigation and&#13;
adaptation indicator). Once the WBG indicator is in place, it will also be included in the World Bank Corporate Scorecard. Data: Fiscal&#13;

Satisfactory outcomes of World Bank Group operations (%, IEG rating): Percentage of operations in World Bank (IBRD and IDA),&#13;
IFC and MIGA portfolio (three-year rolling average) at exit (at early operating maturity for IFC investments and MIGA guarantees)&#13;
rated moderately satisfactory, satisfactory, or highly satisfactory on achievement of development outcomes by the Independent&#13;
Evaluation Group (IEG). Note that IEG evaluates Bank, IFC, and MIGA according to different methodologies and sampling techniques,&#13;
and the ratings therefore are not directly comparable.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 World Bank IBRD and IDA operations. Share of IBRD and IDA operations and of IBRD and IDA commitments rated by the IEG&#13;
    as â&#128;&#156;moderately satisfactoryâ&#128;&#157; or higher on achievement of outcomes. Data are for projects exiting in the three previous fiscal&#13;
    years for which at least 60% of the projects for each fiscal year have been evaluated by IEG. The rating captures the extent to&#13;
    which a projectâ&#128;&#153;s original or formally revised development objectives were achieved. The rating is based on three criteria: (i)&#13;
    relevance of the objectives and design (relevance); (ii) extent to which the objectives were achieved (efficacy); and (iii) extent to&#13;
    which the operation achieves a higher rate of return than the opportunity cost of capital, or is able to provide a similar economic&#13;
    justification (efficiency).&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 For IFC and MIGA operations, the development outcome rating is a synthesis rating reflecting achievement of both project&#13;
    benchmarks and objectives. It rates the project across four development dimensions: project business success, economic&#13;
    sustainability, environmental and social effects, and private sector development impact.&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 For IFC, the rating captures percentage of IFC investment projects rated over a given calendar year with Highly Successful,&#13;
    Successful, or Mostly Successful Development Outcome ratings. IFCâ&#128;&#153;s project evaluation for a given calendar year is based on a&#13;
    representative sample of projects that have reached early operating maturity, defined as projects approved five years earlier than&#13;
    the calendar year for which the evaluation is being conducted (with adjustments for early operating maturity made based on&#13;
    judgments by IEG and IFC staff). It is based on a self- evaluation by investments staff of development and investment outcomes,&#13;
    as well as work quality and their sub-dimensions using Expanded Project Supervision Reports (XPSR) and corporate guidelines.&#13;
    All ratings are independently validated by the Private Sector Evaluation department of the Independent Evaluation Group&#13;
    (IEGPE) and are adjusted, as needed, to ensure that the prescribed evaluation guidelines and criteria are applied consistently.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 For MIGA, the ratings capture the percentage of MIGA- supported projects rated satisfactory or excellent for their development&#13;
    outcomes. MIGA and IEG evaluate the entire population of regular MIGA guarantee projects reaching operating maturity in a&#13;
    given fiscal year. Projects supported by the Small Investment Program (covering eligible guarantees up to $10 million) are being&#13;
    evaluated on a programmatic basis. MIGA staff conduct self- evaluations of a proportion of regular MIGA guarantee projects;&#13;
    these are independently validated by IEG. In addition, IEG evaluates a share of MIGA projects directly to ensure coverage of the&#13;
    population of regular guarantees by evaluation. Both self-evaluations and direct evaluations follow the same evaluation guidelines&#13;
    and criteria.&#13;

Climate-related World Bank Group commitments (US$ billions, annual): Annual dollar amount of World Bank Group commitments&#13;
that are addressing climate change mitigation or adaptation. Development activities provide climate change co-benefits when they&#13;
contribute to climate change adaptation and/or mitigation, even when adaptation and/or mitigation is not their main objective. In other&#13;
terms, an activity can provide adaptation and/or mitigation co-benefits both when climate change is among its stated objectives or&#13;
one of its positive externalities. The climate finance system tracks lending commitments with climate change co-benefits at the time of&#13;
project approval, not the amount of emission reductions or increased climate resilience resulting from the financing associated with&#13;
each operation.&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Adaptation is defined as an activity that provides adaptation co-benefits if it reduces the vulnerability of human or natural systems&#13;
    to the impacts of climate change and climate variability-related risks by maintaining or increasing adaptive capacity and resilience.&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Mitigation is defined as an activity that provides mitigation co-benefits if it either reduces Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions into&#13;
    the atmosphere or enhances their removal from the atmosphere. Reductions are measured against a â&#128;&#156;no-projectâ&#128;&#157; baseline, and,&#13;
    similar to adaptation, the assessment is based on information in the projectâ&#128;&#153;s appraisal and/or supporting documents.&#13;

Staff diversity (index): The Staff Diversity Index measures the aggregate difference from a target of â&#128;&#156;1.â&#128;&#157; The weighted composite index&#13;
is made up of four institutional diversity indicators: Sub-Saharan African/Caribbean (SSA/CR) staff at grades GF and above, women in&#13;
technical roles at grades GF and above, Part II Managers, and Female Managers. Each indicator has a target and is weighted to form a&#13;
component of the index, with each indicator weighted at 0.20, except for SSA/CR, which is weighted at 0.40. The index components are&#13;
calculated by multiplying the weight by the progress of the applicable indicator, measured as the ratio of each indicator to its target.&#13;
Surpassing the target for each indicator is weighted the same as achieving the target, with no additional credit awarded. The final index&#13;
is the sum of the four components, with a WBG institutional target and maximum of â&#128;&#156;1â&#128;&#157;.&#13;

Commitments with climate co-benefits (US$ billions): Investment project financing (IBRD and IDA) commitments that address climate&#13;
change mitigation or adaptation. Development activities are considered to provide climate change co-benefits when they contribute to&#13;
climate change adaptation and/or mitigation, even when adaptation and/or mitigation is not their primary development objective. In&#13;
other words, an activity can provide adaptation and/or mitigation co-benefits both when climate change is among its stated objectives&#13;
or is integrated into the projectâ&#128;&#153;s components. The World Bank data management system (SAP) tracks lending commitmentsÂ with&#13;
climate change co-benefits at the time of project approval in dollar terms, not the volume of emission reductions or increased climate&#13;
resilience resulting from the operation.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Adaptation co-benefits are defined as are the results of an activity that specifically intends to reduce risks from increasing climate&#13;
    variability or the vulnerability of human or natural systems to the impacts of climate change by maintaining or increasing adaptive&#13;
    capacity and resilience.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Mitigation is defined as an activity that provides mitigation co-benefits if it either reduces Greenhouse Gases (GHG) emissions into&#13;
    the atmosphere or enhances their removal from the atmosphere. Reductions are measured against a â&#128;&#156;no-projectâ&#128;&#157; baseline, and,&#13;
    similar to adaptation, the assessment is based on information in the projectâ&#128;&#153;s appraisal and/or supporting documents.&#13;

three attributes based on seven questions in the 2015 Engagement Survey: (i) Q27. and Q49. Creating an environment of trust and&#13;
inclusiveness; (ii) Q24, Q29 and Q50. Managerial commitment and accountability for diversity and inclusion; and (iii) Q47 and Q48.&#13;
Treating staff with fairness, dignity and respect.&#13;

            In July 2013, the World Bank Group
            launched its Strategy, outlining how it will partner more
            effectively with clients to help them achieve the ambitious
            goals of eradicating extreme poverty and boosting shared
            prosperity through economic growth, inclusion,
            sustainability and resilience. In April 2014, the World Bank
            Group Corporate Scorecard was launched for the first time
            and the World Bank Scorecard revised to monitor the
            implementation of the strategy. The World Bank Group
            Scorecard provides view of the results and performance
            indicators of the three World Bank Group institutions: the
            World Bank (WB), the International Finance Corporation
            (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
            (MIGA). This brochure presents the scorecards, updated with
            the latest data available in fiscal year 2015. The
            scorecards are structured in three tiers. A tier one and two
            presents indicators monitoring aspects of growth,
            inclusiveness, and sustainability and resilience. Tier three
            captures the progress in implementing the World Bank Group
            strategy and includes measures of both operational and
            organizational effectiveness.
