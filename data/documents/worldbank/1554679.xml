Abstract&#13;
This paper assesses alternative foreign borrowing strategies&#13;
for Thailand using a medium-term dynamic optimization model. The model&#13;
has five sectors; rubber, other agriculture, manufacturing, services,&#13;
and construction.    All markets clear with endogenous domestic prices.&#13;
The model solution is a set of annual borrowing and investment levels,&#13;
which then, through a general equilibrium system, determine domestic&#13;
output, trade flows, and consumption, and which are chosen so as to&#13;
maximize welfare.&#13;
This model is first applied to an analysis of the historical&#13;
strategy taken by Thailand between 1975 and 1981. We find that Thailand&#13;
may indeed have overborrowed toward the end of the 1970s, and attribute&#13;
the divergence of the actual and the optimal borrowing paths partly to&#13;
inaccurate expectations on the timing and duration of shocks and partly&#13;
to government policies that distorted market forces.&#13;
The model is then solved for 1985-1992 to generate a future&#13;
foreign borrowing strategy.   The result shows that Thailand can utilize&#13;
moderate foreign borrowing beneficially, given its potential for strong&#13;
economic performance in the next decade. This is, however, conditional&#13;
on export   performance as good as in the past, on raising domestic&#13;
savings  and  on  altering  the  structure  of domestic   output   towards&#13;
tradeable goods.   The role of lender behavior is critical in assessing&#13;
the appropriateness of the borrowing strategy. We use an intertemporal&#13;
lending constraint that is linked to public finances.     Tightening this&#13;
constraint is one way of reducing the risk of a debt crisis.      We then&#13;
describe alternative foreign borrowing strategies through sensitivity&#13;
analyses and derive elasticities of optimal responses to various shocks&#13;
and policy changes.&#13;
The analysis suggests that robust foreign borrowing strategies&#13;
should be based on an understanding of the structure of the economy, its&#13;
flexibility in adjusting to shocks, on expectations of future events,&#13;
and on lenders' behavior. The endogenous and simultaneous nature of the&#13;
interactions of key macrovariables cannot be overemphasized. Thus, the&#13;
borrowing strategy must be made consistent with fiscal, monetary and&#13;
commercial policies.&#13;

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
i.       This paper addresses two issues that are central to the present&#13;
policy debate in Thailand: how should the government establish medium-&#13;
term borrowing and investment strategies and what factors should cause&#13;
modifications in these strategies.     These are general issues that re-&#13;
volve around how a society should allocate resources intertemporally.&#13;
We present a methodology which permits a resolution of the problem,&#13;
based on a simple specification of welfare and production functions.&#13;
This approach focuses on the economic costs and benefits of foreign bor-&#13;
rowing.&#13;
ii.      We have constructed and calibrated for simulation purposes a&#13;
five-sector dynamic optimization model in order to shed more light on&#13;
alternative foreign borrowing strategies for Thailand. The model maxi-&#13;
mizes the discounted sum of utilities over a given period of time with a&#13;
terminal condition that implies balanced growth is reached after the&#13;
transitional period is over. Aggregate levels of investment and foreign&#13;
borrowing are the choice variables; the rest of the economy is assumed&#13;
to function in a general equilibrium manner, i.e., all commodity and&#13;
factor markets clear with endogenous prices.&#13;
iii.     The first-order conditions    for optimization imply that the&#13;
levels of borrowing and investment are chosen so that the real cost of&#13;
foreign borrowing and the real rate of return on investment are equated&#13;
with the real social discount rate.     The latter is a function of the&#13;
pure rate of time preference, the growth rate of consumption, and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
degree with which marginal utility declines as consumption goes up. The&#13;
pure rate of time preference is parametrically given and signifies the&#13;
impatience of the population.    The higher the growth rate of consump-&#13;
tion, the higher is the social discount rate, because one values the&#13;
present more knowing that higher consumption will be available in the&#13;
future. Higher investment today means, ceteris paribus, lower consump-&#13;
tion today and a higher consumption tomorrow; the real social discount&#13;
rate thus increases with higher investment, whereas the real return on&#13;
investment tends to go down.     Higher borrowing would lower the growth&#13;
rate of consumption by increasing today's consumption and reducing&#13;
tomorrow's when debt service falls due.     More borrowing would also in-&#13;
crease the real cost of borrowing, not only because of the increasing&#13;
cost of adjustment to new capital sources assumed in the model, but also&#13;
because of changes generated in the time profile of relative prices.&#13;
Borrowing lowers the price of tradeables relative to nontradeables, and&#13;
debt repayment increases it.    The borrowing, then is carried out when&#13;
tradeables are cheap in terms of home goods, and repayment is made when&#13;
tradeables are more expensive.    The real cost of loans in the economy,&#13;
therefore, in terms of consumption foregone, increases with this real&#13;
depreciation.&#13;
iv.      This relative price ratio between tradeables and nontradeables,&#13;
which we conveniently call the real exchange rate, is critical because&#13;
it has a close association with the current account deficit by determin-&#13;
ing largely the excess demand for domestic tradeables.     The ratio also&#13;
dictates the allocation of new capital stock in the economy by shifting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the relative profitability of the two key sectors, manufacturing and&#13;
services; combined, these produce 72 percent of value added and use 81&#13;
percent of the total capital stock. A higher level of borrowing today,&#13;
by providing imported goods, generates an excess supply for domestic&#13;
tradeables and a consequent lowering of this price ratio.      The higher&#13;
relative price of nontradeables would induce more investment to flow&#13;
into this sector.    With the assumption that capital is immobile after&#13;
installment, this tends to make subsequent adjustment to balance of pay-&#13;
ments shocks more severe by requiring larger real exchange rate depreci-&#13;
ation.&#13;
v.       We have solved the model for the period 1975-81 and compared&#13;
the results with the historical experience.     The major characteristics&#13;
of this exercise are as follows:&#13;
(a)    the  actual  historical  path Thailand   took during&#13;
1975-78 was close to the path projected by the&#13;
model.    (The model was solved twice sequentially&#13;
starting from 1975 and 1978 in order to minimize the&#13;
effects of terminal conditions). Actual investment&#13;
was slightly below the optimal value between 1975-&#13;
78.    However,  actual borrowing and     consumption&#13;
levels were much higher than the optimal solutions&#13;
during the period 1979-81;&#13;
(b)    the current account deficit-to-GDP ratio remained&#13;
fairly constant in the model at around three&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
percent,    whereas    actual    historical    values&#13;
oscillated, reaching a record high of 7.7 percent in&#13;
1979;&#13;
(c)    reflecting the high level of investment earlier on,&#13;
the model GDP grows 0.8 percent higher than actual&#13;
history; and,&#13;
(d)    the  real exchange rate in the model depreciates&#13;
throughout relative to history.&#13;
vi.      In order to explain at least qualitatively the cause of the&#13;
divergence between reality and the model results, several runs have been&#13;
made under alternative specifications. Two alternative explanations for&#13;
the historical evolution of the macroeconomy are presented.     The first&#13;
is that despite evidence that global conditions were deteriorating, Thai&#13;
policy-makers failed to revise their expectations about the future,&#13;
treating high interest rate and low world demand changes as temporary&#13;
phenomena whereas they have proven to be of a medium term nature. How-&#13;
ever, while mistaken perceptions on the permanent or temporary nature of&#13;
high interest rates would help to explain foreign borrowing and consump-&#13;
tion behavior, they would also imply a greater divergence between simu-&#13;
lated and actual investment. A similar inconsistency emerges in explan-&#13;
ations of past behavior that focus on a perceived temporary slow-down in&#13;
world demand.    This can, therefore, only be part of the full explan-&#13;
ation.&#13;
vii.     The alternative story suggests that non-economic factors, or&#13;
nonoptimizing behavior, were important in this period.     One feature of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the desired adjustment path is several years (1978, 1980, 1981) without&#13;
any expansion in per capita consumption.     This may not have been pos-&#13;
sible to achieve politically. The imposition of an arbitrary constraint&#13;
on adjustment that forces per capita utility to rise by at least 1.6&#13;
percent generates a solution with higher consumption, but without higher&#13;
borrowing.&#13;
viii.    The difficulty in explaining the high levels of foreign borrow-&#13;
ing in 1980 and 1981 partly suggests that market forces, on which our&#13;
model behavior rests, were being distorted by government policy.&#13;
Several features of this period stand out.      The results clearly show&#13;
that a desirable program of adjustment to the adverse world development&#13;
should have included a depreciation of the real exchange-rate. The his-&#13;
torical real exchange rate was overvalued by about ten percent. An of-&#13;
ficial objective, however, was to retain the system of a fixed nominal&#13;
parity of the baht against the dollar.      When this system came under&#13;
pressure, reflected in a run-down of reserves, the government failed to&#13;
take adequate measures to reduce balance of payments pressure by a more&#13;
austere fiscal stance.     Instead, loose fiscal policy, and a growing&#13;
overall public deficit, were supported by heavy public foreign borrowing&#13;
especially by state enterprises. It was only when fears of the problems&#13;
associated with rapidly rising indebtedness became acute that action was&#13;
taken to devalue the baht and reduce public external borrowing.      Thus,&#13;
foreign borrowing was not the result of a decision on least cost sources&#13;
of finance in this period. The authorities did not internalize the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
rising cost of external borrowing into their decision-making, and failed&#13;
to substitute these funds with lower cost domestic resources.&#13;
ix.      The base path derived for the medium-term (1985-92) evolution&#13;
of the Thai economy illustrates certain important characteristics of any&#13;
future foreign borrowing strategy.      First, the high current account&#13;
deficits of the recent past cannot continue over a medium-term horizon&#13;
without jeopardizing creditworthiness. Although the deficit may reason-&#13;
ably stay as high as 5.3 percent of GDP in 1985, it must come down&#13;
quickly towards two percent by 1989 and thereafter. Second, in order to&#13;
sustain the capital inflows implied in such a transition path, invest-&#13;
ment must be high and directed towards tradeable production; export&#13;
growth, especially in manufacturing, must be rapid. These would permit&#13;
rapid GDP growth at 7.5 percent per year;    a high rate by present stan-&#13;
dards but one that was exceeded in the past and that is achieved in&#13;
other East Asian economies.    Even so, a continued real depreciation of&#13;
the exchange rate is necessary to promote the required structural ad-&#13;
justment of productive capacity towards foreign-exchange generating out-&#13;
put.   Net foreign exchange resource transfers from international bor-&#13;
rowing must turn negative by 1989 to avoid an excessive debt build-up.&#13;
x.       The future runs have an endogenous      lending constraint that&#13;
links lenders' willingness to lend and the government's capacity to&#13;
mobilize domestic resources.     This effectively constrains the present&#13;
value of the government expenditure not to exceed the present value of&#13;
the government revenue in the long-run, after a transitional period.&#13;
Due to the constraint, policy changes that increase the overall fiscal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
deficit are strongly welfare reducing.    In general the optimal adjust-&#13;
ment of the economy to different shocks/policy changes differ substan-&#13;
tially according to the nature of the shock, the nature of the change in&#13;
expectations about the future, the structure of the economy, especially&#13;
in terms of the substitutability of factors between sectors, and the&#13;
flexibility to react quickly to new conditions.     For example, reducing&#13;
import tariffs, or increasing expenditure in public investment (Eastern&#13;
Seaboard Development) would impinge severely on the economy by reducing&#13;
lenders' willingness to supply additional loans to Thailand.&#13;
xi.      Lower world demand growth would squeeze consumption much mnore&#13;
when the lending constraint is binding than when it is not.       This is&#13;
because a lower growth rate of world trade slows down domestic economic&#13;
growth, reducing government revenue; government expenditure, on the&#13;
other hand,   is relatively rigid.     This loose fiscal stance of the&#13;
government makes debt more risky and access to foreign capital potenti-&#13;
ally limited. Higher export growth does exactly the opposite until the&#13;
lending constraint is no longer binding.    The effects become much more&#13;
moderate from then on.    Increasing the income tax has similar effects;&#13;
by expanding the availability of foreign capital, at a given risk level,&#13;
such a policy may actually increase private consumption.&#13;
xii.     This analysis strongly suggests that robust foreign borrowing&#13;
strategies should be based on an understanding of the following compon-&#13;
ents: the structure of the economy; the speed with which the structure&#13;
can be adjusted as required; stable expectations of future events&#13;
together with estimates of the volatility of some key variables. It is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
also critically important to understand lender behavior and the endog-&#13;
enous nature of the borrowing-investment interaction in a macroeconomic&#13;
framework.&#13;
xiii.    The structure of the economy obviously matters.    To the extent&#13;
that repayment of today's debt must be made by tomorrow's tradeable pro-&#13;
duction, a relatively larger share of tradeable output in the economy is&#13;
associated with more debt carrying capacity, ceteris paribus. Among the&#13;
tradeables, the expansion of nontraditional manufacturing activities is&#13;
imperative in maintaining creditworthiness.     These activities tend to&#13;
have more flexibility in their scope to expand exports as an adjustment&#13;
to shocks than, say, monocultural crop export activities.      The latter&#13;
tend to suffer from inelastic demand, volatile world prices, and unre-&#13;
sponsive production in the short-run. In the case of Thailand, the bor-&#13;
rowing patterns suggested in the base case for the future are condition-&#13;
al on assumptions that world demand for Thai goods remain strong and&#13;
that Thailand would be able to take advantage of such demand by expand-&#13;
ing the nontraditional manufacturing sector.&#13;
xiv.     We have also demonstrated the sensitivity of desired net new&#13;
flows to changes in key parameters. This means that the ability of the&#13;
economy to change its production patterns and use of outputs in a very&#13;
limited amount of time is critical.    Table 12 in section IV lists vari-&#13;
ous elasticities that quantify the country's optimal response to intern-&#13;
al and external shocks. The elasticities suggest that ability to shift&#13;
the labor force from one sector to another, the need to suppress con-&#13;
sumption in order to increase investment and/or exports, and the real&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
depreciation of the exchange rate necessary to change the destination of&#13;
investment toward tradeables and to encourage exports are all key ele-&#13;
ments of a flexible adjustment package.       Especially in the case of&#13;
interest rate shocks and negative world demand shocks, the required ad-&#13;
justment is extensive and painful. When the economy does not have suf-&#13;
ficient flexibility to undertake such far-reaching adjustment in a short&#13;
span of time, borrowing policies should be much more conservative.&#13;
xv.      Expectations as to how the domestic and world environment will&#13;
evolve in the future is another critical element in devising foreign&#13;
borrowing strategies.   From the private sector viewpoint, it is criti-&#13;
cally important to forecast how the real exchange rate will move over&#13;
time.   A successful borrowing strategy necessitates a real deprecia-&#13;
tion. Actual experience of the government's real exchange rate mange-&#13;
ment, however, belies this. External shocks, as well as government pol-&#13;
icy, are important determinants of exchange rate and of real income. If&#13;
wrongly optimistic forecasts of world interest rates or world demand for&#13;
Thai goods are made, then later adjustment when realization of the error&#13;
draws, is quite painful.    Justifiable concerns should thus be raised,&#13;
over the volatility of external conditions.      In our model framework,&#13;
even temporary shocks have permanent effects through the change in rela-&#13;
tive prices and hence the change in the destination of capital invest-&#13;
ment, and through the accumulation of debt.&#13;
xvi.     Finally, knowledge of lender behavior is imperative.      In many&#13;
of the sensitivity runs, the burden of adjustment is made greater be-&#13;
cause of the lending constraint imposed.     Especially in such cases as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
lower import tariffs and implementation of the Eastern Seaboard Develop-&#13;
ment Program, the government investment-savings gap increases, while&#13;
access to foreign borrowing is reduced.     This in turn requires drastic&#13;
increases in exports and investment immediately so that existing debt&#13;
can be serviced throughout by exports, rather than by new borrowing.&#13;
Consumption is naturally reduced substantially.     The volatility of the&#13;
international environment becomes even more critical with the endogenous&#13;
lending constraint because of the procyclical behavior of lenders. When&#13;
shocks do occur, the required adjustment is much more drastic than un-&#13;
constrained cases. Similarly, underinvestment in constrained cases also&#13;
has a high cost.    If investment is kept at suboptimal levels, due to&#13;
political or absorptive reasons, new borrowing will fall.      Hence, ex-&#13;
ports must shoot up and consumption decline to balance the external ac-&#13;
counts.&#13;
xvii.    Foreign borrowing is a process that is closely linked with&#13;
other macroeconomic variables.     Around the optimum, the real cost of&#13;
foreign borrowing is always equated with the real return on investment,&#13;
and real social discount rate.    All of these three indicators, however,&#13;
are endogenous.   It is highly important, in devising foreign borrowing&#13;
strategies, to recognize this interdependence. Such recognition inevit-&#13;
ably links foreign borrowing with other macroeconomic policies.      Know-&#13;
ledge of the economic structure, its flexibility and estimates of future&#13;
variables are necessary to obtain target levels for aggregate foreign&#13;
borrowing and investment. Magnitudes of optimal responses to exogenous&#13;
shocks shown in Table 12 should be of some use in determining how such a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
path should be modified in the future.        Rapid response to external&#13;
shocks lowers the effective cost of borrowing. A proper mix of mone-&#13;
tary, fiscal and commercial policies is essential to achieve this ad-&#13;
justment.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
l.       Thailand has enjoyed steady and strong economic performance&#13;
since 1960.   Real income per capita has grown at an annual average of&#13;
4.7 percent, one of the highest rates among developing countries. This&#13;
was achieved despite high population growth rate in the 1960s (3.3&#13;
percent), and 1970s (2.5 percent).    During the 1970s, however, Thailand&#13;
did not fare as well.    The impact of the first oil shock was absorbed&#13;
without major difficulty, aided by the contemporaneous price boom of its&#13;
own export good, and by a conservative fiscal stance. By 1975, Thailand&#13;
was ready for another investment spurt in order to regain the growth&#13;
rate  of  the  1960s.    Various  expansionary measures   were   therefore&#13;
introduced; many of them distortionary such as fixed energy prices and&#13;
interest rate ceilings. These measures helped achieve the high economic&#13;
growth rates during 1977-79, but also left the country vulnerable to&#13;
external  shocks.    The second round of oil price rises,       therefore,&#13;
affected the country seriously.      With deteriorating terms of trade,&#13;
structural adjustment became indispensable, and efforts towards this end&#13;
started in 1980.&#13;
2.       Despite the difficulty Thailand experienced in adjusting to the&#13;
second oil shock, the country currently enjoys a good credit rating&#13;
among international lenders.     Major debt indicators are better than&#13;
those of many developing countries; the acid test is that the country&#13;
could recently borrow at 0.125 percent above LIBOR.    The susrainability&#13;
of such easy access to offshore financial markets is one of the central&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
policy objectives of the government. There are, however, some worrying&#13;
signs as to whether the access can be maintained over a long period of&#13;
time.   The current account deficit in Thailand averaged 6.3 percent of&#13;
GDP over the years between 1977 and 1981.        In 1979, it reached 7.7&#13;
percent. Despite efforts at structural adjustment, this trend continues&#13;
- the deficit was 7.4 and 5.3 percent in 1983 and 1984 respectively.&#13;
External debt outstanding has grown faster than nominal GDP or export&#13;
revenue since the late 1970s.&#13;
3.       There is considerable debate in Thailand as to the appropriate-&#13;
ness of the borrowing stratergy.     On the one hand, many of the common&#13;
attributes of debt crisis countries are missing.       For the most part,&#13;
foreign resources have been used for investment purposes, rather than&#13;
for consumption.   Heavy borrowing has also allowed Thailand to absorb&#13;
the impact of external shocks, including the recent OECD recession&#13;
without a significant stoppage in domestic economic activity. There is&#13;
little capital flight; most of the large public enterprises are&#13;
technically efficient; the tariff regime does not produce excessive&#13;
distortions that may engender immiserizing or inefficient growth; tight&#13;
monetary policy has kept inflation under control, even during the high&#13;
growth period.    On the other hand, there is concern amongst policy-&#13;
makers  that   foreign  borrowing  has  been  excessive   -   that  it  is&#13;
mortagaging the future, that it is overly risky, that future&#13;
creditworthiness may be jeopardized, resulting in high costs of sharp&#13;
adjustment if the country has to struggle to avoid a debt crisis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4.       This  paper   presents  an  assessment  of  alternative   foreign&#13;
borrowing strategies for Thailand based on a comparison of the costs and&#13;
benefits of foreign borrowing, evaluated in the context of a dynamic&#13;
model of optimal growth.    The fundamental dynamic choices that must be&#13;
faced by economic planners revolve around two questions: (i) how should&#13;
the government establish a medium-term investment and borrowing&#13;
strategy; and, (ii) what factors should cause the government to modify&#13;
this strategy?    These are the central issues addressed below.        The&#13;
modelling exercise on which the analysis is based, while a gross&#13;
simplification of the complexity of the Thai economy, focuses attention&#13;
on the essential parameters of the system.      The model is a device to&#13;
quantify the costs and benefits of borrowing, to be used for planning&#13;
purposes. It is not intended to represent projections for the evolution&#13;
of the Thai economy.    These latter would involve greater detail in the&#13;
specification of the lags and constraints in the economy than is&#13;
attempted here.&#13;
5.       Our treatment of foreign borrowing is analogous to that of&#13;
international trade. Indeed, borrowing is simply trade across time --&#13;
resources received today in exchange for an obligation to give up&#13;
resources in the future.    Given this formulation, developing countries&#13;
may be expected to be net debtors in their early stages for several&#13;
reasons. First, when borrowed funds are appropriately invested in high&#13;
return projects (evaluated at border prices), they should generate a net&#13;
revenue stream greater than the debt service obligation. Second, at low&#13;
income levels, a country's ability to mobilize resources internally is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
limited by low levels of consumption, by the inadequacy of financial&#13;
markets which discourages saving and by a low tax effort. Attempts to&#13;
raise dometic savings are often highly distortionary (for example, by&#13;
increasing trade taxes).    Foreign borrowing permits some substitution&#13;
for domestic savings which reduces such distortions.         Third,  in a&#13;
volatile world evironment, major structural adjustments are often&#13;
required. Borrowing can provide the resources to enable such adjustment&#13;
to be made gradually rather than abruptly.         Section II provides a&#13;
detailed description of the methodology of how the costs and benefits of&#13;
borrowing are evaluated in a growth model. The calibration of the model&#13;
parameters to fit the Thai experience is discussed, and analysis is made&#13;
of the sensitivity of the model to key unobservable parameters.&#13;
6.       The listing of the benefits of borrowing suggests that the&#13;
assessment of appropriate levels will depend, inter alia, on the real&#13;
returns to investment, the choice between consumption today and&#13;
consumption in the future, the vulnerability of the economy to external&#13;
shocks, the efficiency with which it can reallocate resources from non-&#13;
tradeable to tradeable production to service debt, the prospects for&#13;
export expansion without damage to the terms of trade, and for import&#13;
substitution. These are all factors that are highly country specific.&#13;
Accordingly,   Section   III  discusses   briefly   the  recent   economic&#13;
performance of Thailand and the initial conditions that shape its&#13;
prospects for the future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7.       From this review of the past, crucial questions relating to&#13;
foreign borrowing emerge in a policy context.      These are analyzed in&#13;
Section IV. The issues addressed are:&#13;
(i)   Did Thailand overborrow in the past?     We conclude that&#13;
there has, indeed, been overborrowing, especially from&#13;
non-concessional,   private   commercial  lenders.     The&#13;
overborrowing is most acute in the early 1980s, when high&#13;
nominal interest rates sent borrowing costs soaring.&#13;
(ii)  What caused the overborrowing?    It appears that much of&#13;
the debt accumulation was incurred by public enterprises&#13;
that were constrained by price controls from generating&#13;
the internal resources necessary to finance investment.&#13;
In general, the fiscal deficit was too high given high&#13;
interest rates.     This may be because the authorities&#13;
expected the interest hike to be a temporary phenomenon.&#13;
(iii) What were the consequences and costs of this over-&#13;
borrowing? The results show the strong real appreciation&#13;
of the baht associated with overborrowing, and the&#13;
consequent bias against exports.    They also demonstrate&#13;
the costs in terms of foregone future consumption of the&#13;
resulting debt overhang.&#13;
8.       The analysis of the past is important for understanding the&#13;
nature of economic interactions that will govern choices in the&#13;
future.   In addition, it provides some validation for the choice of&#13;
parameters, by demonstrating that the systemic properties of the model&#13;
closely approximate behavior observed in the past. The same parameters&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
should, therefore, provide a reasonable basis on which to make choices&#13;
for the future.   One complication that arises in the future because of&#13;
the build-up of debt is the possibility that lending may be constrained&#13;
at some future time as the risks of difficulties in repayment increase.&#13;
We incorporate, therefore, a model of lender behavior in the analysis.&#13;
Section V discusses strategies for the future, based on the initial&#13;
conditions determined by actual past behavior and forecasts of the main&#13;
external variables. The main issues are:&#13;
(iv)  What should a future borrowing strategy look like?&#13;
(v)   What  are  the   implications  for  associated  government&#13;
policies, especially those governing investment, domestic&#13;
saving, the real exchange rate and exports?&#13;
(vi)  How should   the strategy be modified in the light of&#13;
unanticipated changes in the external environment?.&#13;
(vii) How should lender behavior affect the determination of&#13;
the borrowing strategy?&#13;
9.       Answers to these questions, by their very nature, cannot be too&#13;
precise.    Yet the questions must, nevertheless,     be addessed in the&#13;
forthcoming five year plan.    We focus on the macroeconomic constraints&#13;
that affect foreign borrowing decisions. The analysis shows that there&#13;
is no simple and consistent indicator, such as the debt service ratio,&#13;
that can effectively shape borrowing strategies. On the contrary, blind&#13;
application of a rule-of-thumb in all cases may often be dangerous --&#13;
appropriate   adjustment  depends   critically  on   the  nature   of  the&#13;
disturbance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

II. METHODOLOGY AND THE MODEL&#13;
10.      In this section we discuss the methodology and the model used&#13;
for the analysis. I/    We first outline the theoretical background and&#13;
the characteristics of the basic approach.     Next, the model equations&#13;
and a detailed description of the data requirements and calibration&#13;
procedures are presented.&#13;
11.      Using actual values of investment and foreign borrowing, we&#13;
show that the model replicates the major macroeconomic aggregates fairly&#13;
closely, especially in real terms.     This cannot be taken as a formal&#13;
test of the validity of the economic structure that we impose, given the&#13;
large number of free parameters and the small number of dependent&#13;
variables.   It does, however, suggest that our framework incorporates&#13;
the main characteristics of the Thai economy in the period 1975-81. The&#13;
section concludes with an analysis of the sensitivity of the model&#13;
solutions to key non-observable parameters, such as the pure rate of&#13;
time preference and adjustment costs in investment.&#13;
Theoretical Background&#13;
12.      The  general   problem  is  to  formulate  a  foreign   borrowing&#13;
strategy,   consistent  with   Thailand's  access   to  concessional   and&#13;
nonconcessional loans, that incorporates the country's characteristics,&#13;
1/   Solutions were obtained through the use of GRG based nonlinear&#13;
programming algorithm, CONOPT (Drud (1985)), and a high level modelling&#13;
language, GAMS (Bisschop and Meeraus (1982)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
prospects and historical performance.     Given this, the focus is on a&#13;
medium-term model which emphasizes the policy choices that actually&#13;
arise in the context of the five-year planning process.      As such, the&#13;
model differs from financial-monetary stabilization models whose focus&#13;
is short-term, and from long-term models in which population growth,&#13;
technical progress, and other related variables are made endogenous.&#13;
13.      The basic approach adopted below is one where the impact of&#13;
foreign borrowing and gross fixed capital formation on consumption&#13;
possibilities over time is derived. The alternative consumption streams&#13;
associated with different borrowing and investment strategies are then&#13;
compared, and the "optimum" borrowing and investment levels are&#13;
chosen.   Formally, this involves solving a non-linear, intertemporal&#13;
optimization   problem,   with  borrowing   and   investment  as   control&#13;
variables.&#13;
14.      These three elements -- the non-linearity, the intertemporal&#13;
nature and optimization - differentiate our methodology from existing&#13;
tools used to analyze foreign borrowing issues.      The latter encompass&#13;
the traditional two-gap models (e.g., Chenery and Bruno 1962), linear&#13;
programming (e.g., Chenery and MacEwan 1966), recursive CGE (e.g.,&#13;
Robinson et al., 1983), and macroaccounting models (RMSM, Enders and&#13;
Mattione).    They  are  inadequate   to  analyze  the  foreign borrowing&#13;
problem, which revolves around the intertemporal allocation of resources&#13;
for several reasons. First, proper analysis requires an inherently&#13;
dynamic and forward-looking model.      What is borrowed today must be&#13;
repaid in the future with a cost.       Whether the funds are used for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
consumption today or in the future (via investment) changes the&#13;
evaluation of the burden of debt considerably. This need to incoporate&#13;
expectations of the future into current decision-making has long been&#13;
recognized  for project   evaluation purposes.     As Little and Mirlees&#13;
(1969) put it:     "(this) expresses the entirely plausible proposition&#13;
that we must know where the economy ought to be going before we can&#13;
decide on how it ought to start off. This does not mean that the answer&#13;
will be sensitive ... to what is assumed about the distant future; only&#13;
that one must assume something ... before one has any idea about initial&#13;
policies.   The moral is that optimum growth calculations in solvable&#13;
models are the only satisfactory way of telling at what level current&#13;
acounting prices should be put." Recursive models, which are most often&#13;
used to analyze debt issues are essentially static in decision-making.&#13;
They do not capture today's response to anticipated future events except&#13;
if the latter trigger some indicator (such as an excessive debt service&#13;
ratio,  for  example).     But  an  essential  characteristic   of  foreign&#13;
borrowing is that it permits an accurate prediction of future debt&#13;
service obligations, which should have a strong impact on actions&#13;
today. Intertemporal decision-making is needed.&#13;
15.      Second, optimization is also a useful characteristic in order&#13;
to  give   normative  content   to  the  analysis.     In   addressing  the&#13;
appropriate adjustment to external shocks, for example, a key issue&#13;
raised above, it is not enough simply to simulate one possible&#13;
adjustment path.    We would wish to choose a path that minimizes the&#13;
costs of adjustment.    Optimization provides a benchmark for the levels&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
of main activities and permits quantification of any deviation from such&#13;
a path.    This allows us to value the costs of constraints -          for&#13;
example, on the flexibility of the economy to adjust or the willingness&#13;
of lenders to lend.&#13;
16.      One draw-back to the use of optimization is the need to specify&#13;
the arguments and parameters of an objective function.      This does not&#13;
imply, however, that the results are simply a reflection of an arbitrary&#13;
choice of the welfare function.       Some rule is necessary to compare&#13;
alternative paths of the main macroeconomic aggregates.      Specification&#13;
of a welfare function provides one consistent rule for making such&#13;
comparisons.     Our   focus  is  on   the  intertemporal  trade-offs   in&#13;
consumption  associated  with   foreign  borrowing.    This  provides  the&#13;
rationale for including consumption as an objective.      Other concerns,&#13;
such as the desire to maintain creditworthiness, are not included as&#13;
objectives per se, but are incorporated as constraints under which the&#13;
optimization occurs.    A remaining weakness of the analysis is that it&#13;
treats income distribution in a mechanistic fashion.        Factor income&#13;
shares depend only on the technologies of production in different&#13;
sectors and on the endogenously determined relative prices.        In the&#13;
analysis below, because the non-tradeable sector employs a relatively&#13;
large number of workers and has a labor intensive technology, a rise in&#13;
the price of services relative to manufacturing raises the real wage and&#13;
vice-versa.&#13;
17.      Our choice of the parameters in the utility function, the pure&#13;
rate of time preference and the marginal utility of consumption, reflect&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
judgments on the appropriateness of alternative consumption paths for&#13;
Thailand. Partly, these are based on the experience of other countries;&#13;
partly, they are inferred from the consumption-saving behavior of&#13;
Thailand prior to the heavy borrowing period.    The sensitivity analysis&#13;
demonstrates the change in results as these parameters are varied.      It&#13;
should be noted, however, that much of the analysis reflects changes&#13;
from a base solution.    For such comparisons, the values of the utility&#13;
function parameters are less important than the fact that they remain&#13;
constant.&#13;
18.      Third, the multi-sector, nonlinear aspect of the model is also&#13;
of major importance for the analysis of foreign borrowing. The ability&#13;
to affect some change in the trade balance through relative price&#13;
switching mechanisms is an essential departure from structuralist models&#13;
in which the foreign exchange gap can only be closed by stagnation in&#13;
economic activity.    The ability to specify non-linear production and&#13;
demand schedules makes the determination of key relative prices --&#13;
between consumption and investment goods, non-traded and tradeables,&#13;
domestic tradeable and foreign competitive products - more realistic.&#13;
Endogenous price determination is crucial to understanding the real cost&#13;
of foreign borrowing or the real return on capital, but is lost in&#13;
linear programming techniques. In addition, the structural change that&#13;
is associated with development becomes much more realistic in a non-&#13;
linear setting because it avoids the problems of complete specialization&#13;
often found in linear programming.     Finally, productive relationships&#13;
are made explicit. The important links between the marginal return to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
investment and the marginal cost of foreign borrowing are brought out.&#13;
In many growth/macro-accounting models, (RMSM, Enders and Mattione 1984)&#13;
these links are hidden.&#13;
19.      The treatment of all the major macroeconomic demand variables&#13;
in a consistent intertemporal framework follows the thrust of recent&#13;
literature on the determinants of current account behavior (see&#13;
Dornbusch (1983), Svensson and Razin (1983), Martin and Selowsky (1984),&#13;
Edwards and van Wijnbergen (1985)).    There, emphasis is placed on the&#13;
role of anticipated future events in determining present period&#13;
behavior.    In addition, the    change over time of relative     prices,&#13;
especially between non-traded and traded goods, is stressed. This is of&#13;
particular interest with regard to the analysis of foreign borrowing,&#13;
which provides traded goods today and must be repaid in traded goods in&#13;
the future.    If the real exchange rate must depreciate in order to&#13;
generate the exports required for debt servicing, foreign borrowing&#13;
becomes more expensive than indicated by a simple glance at the interest&#13;
rate.&#13;
20.      The solution to a non-linear, intertemporal optimization model&#13;
will be characterized by a three-way equality between the real social&#13;
discount rate (RSDR), the real return to capital (RRK) and the real cost&#13;
of foreign borrowing (RCFB).    Because the approach is to maximize the&#13;
value of the consumption stream, it is simplest to think in terms of the&#13;
impact of decision-making on consumption. The real social discount rate&#13;
measures the rate at which consumption next period is discounted to give&#13;
its equivalent value in terms of consumption today.     In general, there&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
will be three terms:    the pure rate of time preference is a measure of&#13;
impatience; the growth rate of consumption indicates the change in the&#13;
level at which marginal consumption must be valued; and the coefficient&#13;
of risk aversion measures the rate at which the marginal utility of&#13;
consumption falls as the consumption level rises.       When the RSDR is&#13;
below the RRK, it is appropriate to save more and invest in productive&#13;
capital, reaping the benefits in terms of higher future consumption.&#13;
Higher investment will raise the growth rate of consumption, thereby&#13;
driving up the RSDR while reducing the RRK as the marginal efficiency of&#13;
investment  declines.     This  continues   until  equality  is  reached.&#13;
Similarly, when the RSDR is above the RCFB, it is appropriate to&#13;
substitute foreign for domestic savings. This lowers the growth rate of&#13;
consumption, and hence the RSDR, while driving up the RCFB.     These are&#13;
the essential intertemporal relationships governing the analysis. Under&#13;
certain    additional   restrictions,    governing    the   technological&#13;
coefficients in the production of investment goods, these yield unique&#13;
and stable interior solutions for the levels of investment and borrowing&#13;
that maximize the objective function.&#13;
21.      The properties of such a solution -- the way in which borrowing&#13;
and investment adjust to exogenous changes in the parameters - have&#13;
been discussed in Glick and Kharas (1984) in the context of a two-good,&#13;
two-factor, two-period model.    The model below has some extensions and&#13;
specific features relating theoretical concepts to actual data as&#13;
gathered in the system of national accounts and the balance of payments,&#13;
and capturing important aspects of the Thai economy.    In particular, we&#13;
have introduced the following features:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
(i) five productive sectors in the economy with very&#13;
different market demand characteristics; a rubber sector&#13;
which is only exported; construction which is only used&#13;
for investment; food which is domestically consumed and&#13;
exported; non-traded services which are domestically&#13;
consumed;   and   manufacturing   which  enters   domestic&#13;
consumption, investment and exports.&#13;
(ii)  an explicit input-output structure to capture the role&#13;
played by intermediate inputs and imports.&#13;
(iii) a time horizon of nine years before the economy converges&#13;
towards balanced growth;&#13;
(iv)  heterogeneous  capital  stocks  in each sector, allowing&#13;
sectors to have different profitability in each period,&#13;
which is gradually eroded over time as investment&#13;
accumulates;&#13;
(v)   an allocation of investment that assigns larger shares of&#13;
new capital to more profitable sectors, but that limits&#13;
this flexibility;&#13;
(vi)  consideration of two distinct labor markets, rural and&#13;
urban, with different growth rates to simulate the&#13;
effects of migration;&#13;
(vii) imperfect substitutability between domestic and foreign&#13;
tradeable   goods   used   for   final   consumption   and&#13;
intermediate good demands.   Thus, while world prices are&#13;
given exogenously, there is scope for the domestic price&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
level of tradeables to deviate from world prices (in an&#13;
aggregate sense).    This delimits the possibilities for&#13;
import substitution.&#13;
(viii) imperfect substitutability between Thai exports and&#13;
competing  manufactured   tradeables.    This  formulation&#13;
makes exports sensitive to domestic demand and supply&#13;
conditions as well as to foreign demand conditions.&#13;
(ix)  different types of foreign borrowing.       We distinguish&#13;
between   concessional   assistance,   usually   at  fixed&#13;
interest rates, with long grace and maturity periods, and&#13;
non-concessional borrowing, at variable interest rates.&#13;
The availability of supply of the former is limited,&#13;
whereas the latter is freely available in any period,&#13;
subject to an intertemporal constraint that is associated&#13;
with the evolution of public finances.     We allow for a&#13;
rising marginal cost of commercial borrowing that depends&#13;
on the net flow in any period relative to the stock of&#13;
outstanding debt.    This captures the property that in&#13;
early   years,   before   Thailand   had  an   established&#13;
reputation in international capital markets, the marginal&#13;
costs of a rapid expansion of commercial borrowing were&#13;
high.   Today, given the establishment of close financial&#13;
links, the marginal costs are much closer to average&#13;
costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
(x)   the  marginal   efficiency   of  economy-wide   investment&#13;
declines as the level of investment expenditure rises.&#13;
This sets absorptive capacity constraints on the growth&#13;
potential of the economy in any one period.&#13;
(xi) alternative scenarios illustrate the trade-off between&#13;
risks of a debt crisis and benefits from foreign&#13;
borrowing.   One major draw-back with the approach is the&#13;
lack of a satisfactory treatment of uncertainty. This is&#13;
clearly a major concern in the analysis of foreign&#13;
borrowing.   We address this by tracing out a frontier&#13;
between the level of borrowing and welfare. We indicate&#13;
the point where our analysis suggests that the risk will&#13;
be below a reasonable threshold.&#13;
22.      The next sub-sections describe in detail the equations of the&#13;
model, the process of calibration and the sensitivity analysis to key&#13;
parameters. This analysis is useful for understanding the robustness of&#13;
the conclusions.   It is not, however, essential to the application and&#13;
the general reader may, accordingly, skip to Section III.&#13;
Description of the Model for Thailand&#13;
23.      The model developed below has five sectors:     rubber (EX), the&#13;
rest of agriculture (AG), tradeable manufacturing (TR), nontradeable&#13;
services (NT) and construction (CO). The exact sector division is based&#13;
on the 180-sector social accounting matrix produced by NESDB-IDE-NSO&#13;
(1980).  Rubber and rubber processing industry form the EX sector.     All&#13;
other  agricultural   sectors  are  in  AG.    Mining,  food   processing,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
machinery and other manufacturing activities are aggregated into the TR&#13;
sector. All the rest except for construction are categorized as NT. It&#13;
should be noted that some agricultural final demand appears in the&#13;
manufacturing sector as the demand for output of the food processing&#13;
industry. All equations are listed in the appendix.&#13;
24.      The production relationships in all sectors are assumed to be&#13;
Cobb-Douglas. Only labor and capital services are factors of production&#13;
in urban sectors, whereas land is included exogenously in rural sectors&#13;
(EX, AG), and therefore decreasing returns are postulated with respect&#13;
to capital and labor in these two sectors. Intraregional labor mobility&#13;
is fully assumed within rural and urban regions, but interregional&#13;
mobility takes place at a fixed rate, i.e., urban and rural areas have&#13;
fixed and different labor force growth rates that are consistent with&#13;
historical natural population growth rates adjusted for migration.&#13;
Capital on the other hand has a putty-clay feature; it is completely&#13;
malleable and mobile among sectors before investment actually takes&#13;
place, but once installed it can be removed from the sector only through&#13;
depreciation.&#13;
25.      Foreign    trade   is   specified   as   follows.      Traditional&#13;
agricultural export goods -- rubber, maize, and minor crops -           are&#13;
treated exogenously.    So are the net service receipts.     In all cases,&#13;
the values of these exports are fixed at either actual historical values&#13;
or projected values. The tradeable manufacturing exports are a function&#13;
of world demand of these goods and the relative domestic price vis-a-vis&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
the world market price:  -/&#13;
X  = a WT(e p      )&#13;
where  X  =  manufactured exports&#13;
WT = world trade&#13;
P  =  domestic producers' price&#13;
e  =  nominal exchange rate&#13;
PW =  world price.&#13;
The  elasticity   of  Thai  exports  with   respect  to  world   trade  in&#13;
manufacturing (   C ) reflects the capacity of Thai firms to expand into&#13;
new markets and products and thereby to increase its world market&#13;
share.  The relative price elasticity ( e    ) gives the period-by-period&#13;
world demand curves for Thai goods.        e    will be higher, the more&#13;
diversified are their export goods.     A word of caution is needed here&#13;
due  to the   specific  sector division we elected     to employ.    Rice,&#13;
cassava, tobacco, and sugar exports are included in the tradeable&#13;
manufacturing exports, because the food processing activities are&#13;
classified as manufacturing.&#13;
26.      There are two kinds of imports, both of which occur within the&#13;
manufacturing  sector.    One is noncompetitive capital goods imports,&#13;
proportional to domestic capital formation.     The other is competitive&#13;
imports used for consumption and intermediate inputs.       The latter is&#13;
handled following the tradition of Armington (1969) assuming that people&#13;
1/ A clear exposition of the use of Armington trade functions in Compu-&#13;
table General Equilibrium models is given in Dervis, de Melo and&#13;
Robinson (1982).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
consume hypothetical aggregates of domestically produced goods and&#13;
imported goods.   We choose to use a constant-elasticity-of-substitution&#13;
(CES) function to get this aggregate:&#13;
1&#13;
* = y (e MP + (1 - e) DP)P&#13;
where   * is the amount of the aggregate manufactured commodity that&#13;
imported goods (M) and domestic goods (D) produce, and         y, e, p are&#13;
parameters.   The price of this hypothetical aggregate commodity can be&#13;
represented by the unit-cost function of the CES function.&#13;
1&#13;
PP =1 (e PM-         + (I -  )O pl-O) 1-8&#13;
y      M&#13;
where   e = 1/(1 - p) = elasticity of substitution between M and D&#13;
This is the price purchasers pay for these goods.         The first order&#13;
conditions for cost minimization applied to these relationships yields&#13;
the import demand as a function of domestic and world prices and the&#13;
total sectoral domestic demand for domestically produced goods (D).&#13;
M         cc (  -     PM ) 'D&#13;
The ratio of the domestic component to the total of the aggregate&#13;
(r = D/+) is derived in similar fashion.&#13;
r       =  y1  (1-e)8(  PP  )&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
27.      Investment is a control variable in the dynamic optimization&#13;
version. Expenditure on capital goods for the purpose of investment, I,&#13;
however, is allowed to differ from actual capital formation, J, to&#13;
account for adjustment costs in capital formation.        This implies a&#13;
diminishing marginal efficiency of investment that reflects absorptive&#13;
capacity constraints in the economy.&#13;
28.      Following Hayashi (1979), we specify investment as:&#13;
I = J (1 + f(TK ))    f' &gt; 0&#13;
where TK is the total capital stock.     It can be shown that investment&#13;
depends only on TK, and Tobin's "q" (= ratio of the value of capital to&#13;
its replacement cost = shadow price of capital in terms of capital goods&#13;
price).    For example,   investment of a single optimizing     firm that&#13;
produces its own capital goods can be expressed as&#13;
J = q    I TK&#13;
when  f =  2  TK   .  Investment takes place only when q &gt; 1.&#13;
2 TKC&#13;
29.      We  assume  that   the  construction  and manufacturing   sectors&#13;
provide   exogenously  fixed   shares  of  investment.     The   share  of&#13;
manufacturing is an exogenous variable increasing over time from about&#13;
0.21 to 0.26.   Noncompetitive capital imports are also proportional to&#13;
J,  and  the proportionality is constant     at  0.28.    The origins   of&#13;
investment goods   therefore are 50 percent     tradeable and 50 percent&#13;
construction.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
30.      Once total domestic investment is determined, it is allocated&#13;
across sectors according to the share of total profits originating in&#13;
the sector.   That is, the addition to capital in sector     i , Ji     is&#13;
given by:&#13;
riK&#13;
Ji     JriK &#13;
This formulation implies that investment flows into the most profitable&#13;
sectors, tending to equalize rates of return over time, but without&#13;
leading to instantaneous equality of profit rates among sectors.&#13;
31.      We  postulate   that  foreign  borrowing  also  incurs   cost  of&#13;
adjustment in a similar manner as investment.    The more a country tries&#13;
to borrow nonconcessional loans relative to the debt outstanding the&#13;
more costly it becomes. This is because the borrower must shift to new&#13;
lenders and more expensive financial instruments if it expands borrowing&#13;
very rapidly.    After allowing for higher fees the foreign funds the&#13;
country can effectively utilize from any given loan, therefore, is less&#13;
than the actual debt accumulation.&#13;
32.      All  commodity markets   clear by assumption.     Supply is the&#13;
physical output. Demand varies by the sector. Basically, the domestic&#13;
portion of consumption and intermediate inputs, plus exports, and&#13;
investment demand must exhaust output. In equation form&#13;
Q = r (IM + GC + PC) + X + IE&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
where&#13;
Q   =   Output&#13;
IM  =   Intermediate input demand&#13;
GC  =   Government consumption&#13;
PC  =   Private consumption&#13;
X   =   Exports&#13;
IE  =   Investment expenditure&#13;
For all sectors except for manufacturing, r = 1 because there are no&#13;
competitive imports of non-manufacturing goods by assumption.     There is&#13;
no export from the construction sector and IE is nonzero only in the&#13;
manufacturing and construction sectors.       Both supply and demand are&#13;
sensitive to the own price of the good and to other prices in the&#13;
economy.  Flexible prices act as the mechanism to equilibrate supply and&#13;
demand.   The endogeneity of price determination is a key feature of the&#13;
model.&#13;
33.      Finally, the three agents in the economy (foreigners, public&#13;
sector,   and  private  sector)   have  to   balance  their  revenue   and&#13;
expenditure  in each time-period.      The sum of all foreign exchange&#13;
inflows must equal all outflows, that is, net capital inflows = current&#13;
account   deficit.    Both   public  and   private  sectors  borrow   from&#13;
foreigners.    Public  sector  resources  are net   foreign and domestic&#13;
borrowing   and   tax  revenues,   whereas  expenditures   are   exogenous&#13;
government consumption, government investment and debt service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
34.      We define all the productive activities as belonging to the&#13;
"private sector".   One disadvantage of doing this is that it blurs the&#13;
distinction between the pure private sector and the state enterprises.&#13;
For the purpose of this model, however, where the aggregate transfer is&#13;
the main issue, we leave micro-economic questions pertaining to state&#13;
enterprises for subsequent studies.     Due to this definition, private&#13;
sector income is all the value added at factor cost.     In addition, the&#13;
private sector receives net foreign transfers from abroad (remittances)&#13;
and net foreign private capital inflows. Expenditures are tax payments,&#13;
debt service, investment and private consumption. Naturally, the market&#13;
clearing equations and these three balancing equations assure that the&#13;
value of investment expenditures equals the sum of foreign savings and&#13;
appropriately defined domestic private and government savings.&#13;
35.      The consumption first order condition     says that the marginal&#13;
rate of commodity substitution between two goods equals their price&#13;
ratio in every period:&#13;
.-C   au  =  i/P  in an obvious notation&#13;
aci  aci       j&#13;
Once total consumption is known, from the income-expenditure balance&#13;
above, this rule determines the allocation of consumption demand across&#13;
sectors.&#13;
1, First-order conditions are redundant in the optimization model&#13;
version. But for expository purposes as well as to lessen the&#13;
computation cost they are always included in the program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
36.      The nominal wage rate is assumed to be equal among sectors in&#13;
urban and rural areas:&#13;
aQi&#13;
-   PVi    W,&#13;
i&#13;
where PV is the value-added price (producers' price less indirect tax&#13;
and intermediate input cost) and W is the nominal wage rate.          W is&#13;
perfectly flexible and adjusts to ensure that full employment is always&#13;
attained.&#13;
37.      We solve the model in two ways.        One is to treat it as a&#13;
recursively dynamic computable general equilibrium model.       Investment&#13;
and foreign borrowing are fixed exogenously.      Agents in the model can&#13;
then only make intersectoral decisions in each period, on consumption&#13;
demand and labor allocation.     The other solution form is to solve the&#13;
system as a dynamic optimization model, maximizing the discounted sum of&#13;
each period's utility by choosing appropriate levels of investment and&#13;
borrowing.   Three consumables enter the utility functions: agricultural&#13;
goods, manufacturing goods, and services.      These are combined into a&#13;
Cobb-Douglas aggregate consumption good,     c.   We impose concavity by&#13;
introducing a relative risk aversion parameter "b".       Utility is then&#13;
1-b&#13;
written as:         U       lb           , The "b" parameter measures the&#13;
desire for intertemporal consumption smoothing, i.e. 1/b is interpreted&#13;
as the elasticity of intertemporal utility.     When b = 0, consumption is&#13;
infinitely substitutable across time and the desire to smooth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
consumption is zero. A marginal unit of consumption gives equal utility&#13;
at all levels of consumption.     A positive value of b, means a higher&#13;
desire for intertemporal consumption smoothing -- a diminishing marginal&#13;
utility of consumption.    Welfare is given by the sum of utility over&#13;
time discounted by the pure rate of time preference, 6&#13;
W  = E U /(1+6)t I&#13;
t&#13;
38.      The  numeraire  is  the  international   price of manufactures.&#13;
World prices for manufacturing goods that are relevant in determining&#13;
foreigners' demand for Thai goods, PW, and import prices the Thais pay&#13;
to buy foreign goods, PM, are parametrically given. These two kinds of&#13;
international prices are assumed to coincide for the future analysis.&#13;
With the assumption of an exogenous nominal exchange rate (e), ePW and&#13;
ePM are fixed in each period.     A narrowed resource gap is achieved by&#13;
increasing exports and decreasing imports.     This can occur through a&#13;
lower domestic tradeable price relative to international prices.        In&#13;
other words, the "level" of the domestic price for tradeables has to&#13;
come down in order to reduce the trade gap.        At the same time, the&#13;
domestic excess supply of tradeables should increase. This is achieved&#13;
by increasing the relative price of tradeables vis-a-vis other domestic&#13;
prices. Given the small size of agricultural sectors and construction,&#13;
and partially exogenous nature of the agricultural exports, the excess&#13;
supply of tradeables is largely determined by the movement of relative&#13;
price of tradeables and nontradeable services. Thus, once foreign&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
borrowing is chosen, domestic prices must adjust to generate the trade&#13;
deficit that satisfies the balance of payments equilibrium.&#13;
39.      Real Exchange Rate.   In multi-sector models such as the present&#13;
one we   cannot  define  "the"  real exchange rate exactly.      The most&#13;
critical relative prices are those between domestic and foreign&#13;
tradeables   prices  (to  determine   demand  for  tradeables),   domestic&#13;
tradeables versus non-traded services (to give supply), and domestic&#13;
tradeables versus construction (to determine Tobin's 'q' and hence&#13;
investment).   Because of our assumptions on factor intensities, all of&#13;
these tend to move together.    We therefore choose to call the price of&#13;
domestic tradeables relative to non-traded services the "real exchange&#13;
rate".   As this rises -    a depreciation -- the supply of tradeables&#13;
rises, the resource gap narrows, and investment rises.&#13;
40.      Terminal  Conditions.     Terminal  conditions  are  required  to&#13;
prevent last period borrowing from rising to infinity and investment&#13;
from falling to zero. The terminal conditions give a value to the stock&#13;
of capital remaining at the end of the planning horizon, and penalize&#13;
the existence   of a high stock of debt outstanding.        The valuation&#13;
functions are necessarily arbitrary in a finite horizon model.       These&#13;
are derived as follows.     First, we make use of the turn-pike theory&#13;
(e.g., Chakravarty 1960) that states that the optimal evolution of the&#13;
economy over time will follow a balanced growth path.     Next, we assume&#13;
that the economy has reached the turn-pike by our final period.       This&#13;
implies that investment and new borrowing are determined as functions of&#13;
the next-to-last period's capital stock and debt outstanding, because&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
steady growth in these stocks is required.        (see Appendix 2).     The&#13;
associated consumption and utility levels along the balanced growth path&#13;
can then be calculated, and are discounted back to the present to yield&#13;
the present value of capital and debt.      Thus, our terminal conditions&#13;
give us an upper bound on the value of capital and the cost of debt.&#13;
Expanding the planning horizon would therefore tend to give lower values&#13;
for investment and higher levels of borrowing. This is confirmed in the&#13;
sensitivity analysis.    In general, the length of the planning horizon&#13;
only affects the results significantly for two years prior to the last&#13;
period.&#13;
Data and Parameters for Calibration of the Model&#13;
41.       Data  requirements.    In  order  to utilize   the model   as an&#13;
empirically relevant tool of analysis, estimation of model parameter&#13;
values should be carried out so that specific features of the Thai&#13;
economy can be highlighted. The following data sets were used.&#13;
(1) social accounting matrix (SAM) for 1975 (base year);&#13;
(2) time series values of sectoral outputs and prices;&#13;
(3) time series data on manufacturing exports together with&#13;
their world price indices and the total world trade values&#13;
quantity indices;&#13;
(4) time series data on imports together with the world prices&#13;
and the decomposition of imports into capital goods and&#13;
other imports;&#13;
(5) time series on foreign borrowing and other international&#13;
transfers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
(6) time series on investment and labor force&#13;
(7) at least one year (base year)'s sectoral capital stocks Y&#13;
(8) at least one year (base year)'s data on fiscal revenues.&#13;
(9)  time   series   values   of   exogenous  variables,   i.e.,&#13;
government consumption, agricultural and service sector&#13;
exports.&#13;
The following paragraphs describe the way in which these data sets are&#13;
used   to   calibrate  all   the   parameters   values  needed   for   the&#13;
operationalization of the the model.&#13;
42.      The first step of this process is to choose a base year and&#13;
then find complete and consistent data sets for the base year.       These&#13;
data sets are used to calibrate certain parameters such that the&#13;
endogenous variables in the base year equal historical values, with the&#13;
assumption of all unitary prices. The year 1975 has been chosen as most&#13;
appropriate for the base year because of the following reasons:&#13;
(1) we are interested in analyzing the foreign borrowing&#13;
paths of Thailand both in the past and the future,&#13;
and the major debt accumulation in Thailand occurred&#13;
toward the end of the 1970s.&#13;
(2) a detailed 180 sector social accounting matrix is&#13;
available in 1975 (NESDB-IDE-NSO 1980).&#13;
(3) 1975 was a year when Thailand was still free from&#13;
major economic problems, and the economy was&#13;
See below for how we estimated these figures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
functioning   relatively   well   without   excessive&#13;
distortions that developed in Thailand later in the&#13;
decade.&#13;
The social accounting matrix (SAM) for 1975 in producers' price provided&#13;
the majority of the parameter values.      The detailed sector divisions&#13;
were first aggregated into the five sectors employed in the present&#13;
model. Table 1 exposits the modified aggregate social accounting matrix&#13;
used here.    Inter-industry flows are specified by exogenously given&#13;
intermediate input-output coefficients,   aij       These IO coefficients&#13;
are simply taken from the SAM as&#13;
IM&#13;
a _&#13;
aij= &#13;
where  IMij is the intermediate input from sector i to sector J.&#13;
43.      Final demand vectors are derived straightforwardly from the&#13;
SAM.   Essentially all that was involved was to aggregate the large&#13;
number of sectors into the five sectors we elected to use.     Due to the&#13;
fact that there is no satisfactory behavioral assumption to handle&#13;
changes in stock in general equilibrium modeling, these are reduced to&#13;
zero.   Minor changes are added on to fixed capital formation.       Large&#13;
changes (agriculture, some manufacturing) are adjusted in view of the&#13;
l/ Some coefficients, especially the rural inputs into the tradeable&#13;
manufacturing sector are allowed to decline with an exogenous trend.&#13;

trend of changes in stock in these sectors before and after 1975. This&#13;
involved some adjustment of the rest of the SAM.&#13;
44.      Export functions are obtained in the following manner.    For the&#13;
exports of EX (rubber), AG (the rest of agriculture) and net service&#13;
payments, the values are set exogenously at historical levels.        This&#13;
simply means the export demands have unitary domestic price elasticities&#13;
in these sectors. A manufacturing exports function is estimated through&#13;
regression analysis for Thailand and from results in the literature for&#13;
equivalent parameters for other comparable countries, such as Japan,&#13;
Korea and Taiwan.    The elasticity with respect to the domestic price&#13;
level is assumed to be 1.8.    The world trade elasticity is 2.2.    A one&#13;
percent increase in the total world trade would raise Thai exports by&#13;
two percent.   This reflects the past success of Thailand in expanding&#13;
its  market   share   in   the  international   market.     Imports   were&#13;
disaggregated into competitive imports, and non-competitive capital&#13;
goods imports. The share of capital goods imports in the total capital&#13;
formation is assumed to be fixed in the short-to-medium run at this 1975&#13;
value (27 percent).     All other imports are assumed competitive.      In&#13;
reality, there are a large number of non-capital goods imported into&#13;
Thailand.     Some  of  them  are   clearly  noncompetitive,  and   others&#13;
competitive.   Some may be import-substitutable in the medium-run and&#13;
others in the short-run.    A multisector modeling deals with aggregates&#13;
of these as a sector good. Instead of going through difficult judgments&#13;
as to which imports are noncompetitive in the original SAM, therefore,&#13;
we follow the tradition of Armington (1969) assuming a finite elasticity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
of substitution between imports and domestic products.     The elasticity&#13;
can be estimated econometrically or specified exogenously.      Reflecting&#13;
the high level of noncompetitiveness of Thai imports, the elasticity for&#13;
manufacturing imports chosen is 0.5.     Sectoral consumption shares are&#13;
also given in the SAM in the base year.    For the rest of the simulation&#13;
years, consumption of each consumable good is estimated such that&#13;
sectoral output is exhausted by its uses.      This results in different&#13;
consumption shares from the base year, and indicates possible changes in&#13;
taste,  or non-unitary income elasticities.       The tradeable share of&#13;
consumption increases from 0.4 and stabilizes at 0.44.       The share of&#13;
nontradeables oscillates without a trend between 0.46 and 0.48,&#13;
averaging 0.476, while the agricultural consumption share declines from&#13;
0.12 to 0.08.&#13;
45.      Other data come from CEM reports of the World Bank.       Land is&#13;
exogenously given at the level of 1975 throughout the simulation. This&#13;
reflects the slowdown of land expansion during the second half of the&#13;
1970s in Thailand. The total urban labor force, and total rural labor&#13;
force are available in various CEM reports for several years including&#13;
the base year.&#13;
46.      The absence of conformable data on the sectoral allocation of&#13;
labor is not a serious problem, because we employ the assumption of&#13;
intraregionally mobile labor. Thus, sectoral labor allocation within a&#13;
region is determined endogenously through wage equalization. Reflecting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
rural-urban migration, the urban labor force grows at around 5-6 percent&#13;
p.a. whereas rural labor grows around one percent.          The aggregate&#13;
national labor force as a result grows at 2.9 percent.&#13;
47.      The most difficult task is to estimate the capital stock by&#13;
sector in 1975.   We use the time-series data on fixed national capital&#13;
formation and ICORs since 1960.     We also have the results of various&#13;
manufacturing surveys that report book-value capital stocks. From these&#13;
sources, we proceeded as follows. The total economy-wide capital stock&#13;
is estimated using a perpetual inventory method.      This value was then&#13;
compared with a value derived from assuming that an average of recent&#13;
ICORs is the average capital-output ratio.      Arbitrary judgments were&#13;
used to reconcile these into an estimate of the aggregate capital&#13;
stock.   Next, a measure of the manufacturing sector's capital stock is&#13;
estimated from a survey, and the rate of return on capital in that&#13;
sector calculated.   We then allocated the rest of the capital stock in&#13;
the economy in a manner that improved the compatibility of the&#13;
simnulations with actual experience.&#13;
48.      Taxes on wage and capital income are calculated as average ad&#13;
valorem rates from the government revenue statistics in CEM reports, and&#13;
are assumed to remain constant.    Constant indirect tax and tariff rates&#13;
are also calculated as sector averages from the SAM.&#13;
49.      Production   functions  are    guesstimated"  according   to  the&#13;
following  rule.    Because  of  the  Cobb-Dougles   production relations&#13;
assumed in this model, the factor shares stay constant and can be&#13;
derived directly from the SAM. The NESDB-IDE-NSO SAM, however, reports&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
only the actual payment of wages and salaries and the operating&#13;
surplus.   The latter, in case of small scale firms and family farms,&#13;
includes an imputed wage for family member workers and the land rent for&#13;
agriculture. Some adjustments and imputations were made through the use&#13;
of wage data in CEM.      We use these factor shares as the production&#13;
elasticity of each factor in each sector. What remains to be estimated&#13;
are Hicks neutral constants of the production functions.      They are in&#13;
fact calibrated within the sample periods such that with historical&#13;
price levels and our assumed factor allocation rule, historical values&#13;
of each sector output in each year is reproduced.     They are allowed to&#13;
change year by year, because:&#13;
(1) this allows us to capture changes in technical progress,&#13;
and oscillating capital utilization; and,&#13;
(2) we can similarly capture past supply shocks, such as bad&#13;
weather for agriculture.&#13;
Table 2 shows the values of these coefficients. The agricultural sector&#13;
enjoys a rapid productivity improvement initially, but hits a plateau in&#13;
1978.    Similarly,  the tradeable manufacturing    seems to enjoy rapid&#13;
technical  progress  (7.8  percent   p.a.)  until  1979.    In  1980,  the&#13;
technical  coefficient is reduced.     This can be attributed    to lower&#13;
capital utilization due to the world-wide impact of the second oil-&#13;
shock.   The nontradeable service sector has a consistently declining&#13;
coefficient value.&#13;

international parameters (world trade in manufacturing, world interest&#13;
rate, and international prices) are all given exogenously year by year.&#13;
51.      Indices of world trade in manufacturing goods and export prices&#13;
have  been   taken  from  the  U.N.   World  Trade  Yearbook.     The  MUV&#13;
(manufacturing unit value) estimated at the World Bank has been used as&#13;
the manufacturing import price index.     World interest rates come from&#13;
the World Debt Tables.     We have three types of borrowing:     official,&#13;
concessional loans; nonconcesional loans borrowed by the government, and&#13;
nonconcessional loans borrowed by the private sector. Average interest&#13;
rates on loans of official sources are assumed to apply on all loans of&#13;
the first type.   The average rate of all other loans is applied to the&#13;
other two types of loans, regardless of whether the borrower is private&#13;
or public.&#13;
52.      Finally, there are unobservable cost of adjustment parameters&#13;
for investment and borrowing.      For the investment installation cost&#13;
( u ), a factor of three was chosen. For the borrowing cost, two values&#13;
have been used.   In the historical analysis the value is 1.0 and in the&#13;
future simulation the value is 0.4.    This tries to capture the property&#13;
that the marginal costs of a rapid expansion of commercial borrowing&#13;
were high until Thailand had an established reputation in international&#13;
capital markets. These values mean that the marginal cost of investment&#13;
and borrowing are between eight to ten percent higher than the average&#13;
cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Testing the Model&#13;
53.      The model is under-identified in the sense that it has many&#13;
more parameters than there are observations to track.    Therefore, there&#13;
are no established statistical tests for estimating the empirical&#13;
validity of the model.      We simply choose parameters     that generate&#13;
economy-wide behavior similar to that actually observed in Thailand.&#13;
54.      We  focus  on   the  model's  ability  to  reproduce   the  truly&#13;
endogenous variables   that have a key role in the determination of&#13;
foreign  borrowing.    These  are sectoral   private consumption levels,&#13;
output, manufacturing exports and competitive imports. These all depend&#13;
on the relative prices calculated by the model.        The production and&#13;
demand parameters were chosen such that history would be reproduced&#13;
given actual relative prices.     Thus, the deviation of the calculated&#13;
variables from history depends mainly on the model's success in&#13;
generating appropriate prices, when borrowing and investment are fixed&#13;
at historical levels.&#13;
55.      Overall, the model replicates the economic history of Thailand&#13;
during 1975-1981 well.   Figure 1 compares actual with simulated values&#13;
for GDP, consumption, tradeable and nontradeable outputs, manufacturing&#13;
exports,  competitive imports and the real exchange rate.        All real&#13;
variables are in 1975 billion bahts.      Clearly, the model is able to&#13;
replicate the real aspects of the Thai economy with a comfortable degree&#13;
of precision. The explicit domestic price comparison is shown in Figure&#13;
2.   One problem lies with observing actual prices for the composite&#13;
goods implicit in each of our sectors. A rough approximation is derived&#13;

from the national income accounts in current and constant prices. This,&#13;
however, only gives value-added price indices, not gross output price&#13;
indices. Prices of the manufacturing good are the closest to the actual&#13;
historical time-series.    This is due to the fact that the tradeable&#13;
prices are related with international prices, through the positive&#13;
substitutability between domestic and foreign goods.        The two rural&#13;
sectors and the non-tradeable service sector tend to have higher prices&#13;
than actual.   As a result, the relative price of tradeables divided by&#13;
that of nontradeables (one measure of the real exchange rate) shows a&#13;
sharper  appreciation   than  shown  by  the  sectoral  national   account&#13;
indices.  On the other hand, the model simulation prices shows a pattern&#13;
of real exchange rate movements that is close to the pattern displayed&#13;
by in-depth analysis     of the trade-weighted real effective exchange&#13;
rate.     Given this, and the success of the model in explaining the&#13;
evolution of the real side of the economy, we use in the sequel of the&#13;
paper the ratio of the tradeable to nontradeable price of the CGE&#13;
simulation as the implicit actual real exchange rate of the economy,&#13;
rather than the national accounts prices with their associated index&#13;
number and aggregation problems.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
56.      The credibility of the model is enhanced if results are robust&#13;
with respect to minor changes in parameters, especially those whose&#13;
values were obtained through educated guesses rather than calibration or&#13;
statistical estimation. We also benefit from knowledge of what the cost&#13;
of not using the "right" values for the parameters. We therefore tested&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
the model by performing sensitivity analyses with regard to the&#13;
following five parameters.&#13;
(1) the inverse of intertemporal elasticity of utility (or&#13;
relative risk aversion of the utility function);&#13;
(2)  the pure rate of time preference;&#13;
(3)  the cost of adjustment in investment;&#13;
(4)  the terminal period balanced growth rate; and,&#13;
(5)  the length of the planning horizon.&#13;
57.      Consumption   Smoothing:      The   sensitivity   test   involved&#13;
increasing "b" from 0.6 to 0.9, (by 50 percent).     The desire to smooth&#13;
consumption over time increases (Figure 3).     Results, however, do not&#13;
change very much from the base run.      Private consumption is smoothed&#13;
over time by being raised earlier (1.6 percent) and lowered later (0.1&#13;
percent).   Investment is the mirror image.      Borrowing is marginally&#13;
higher.    Earlier  it  finances  higher  consumption,  and later higher&#13;
investment. Divergence of any of these variables from the base run does&#13;
not exceed three percent.&#13;
58.      Higher Rate of Pure Time Preference.     An increase in the pure&#13;
rate of time preference from 5 percent to 5.5 percent also has a visible&#13;
but relatively minor effect on major variables (Figure 4).&#13;
Consumption increases throughout the transition path to balanced growth,&#13;
at which point it falls below the base case.         This is financed by&#13;
slightly higher borrowing and reduced investment.        Here, again, the&#13;
results are as predicted, but not large to a bothersome extent.&#13;

59.      Higher Cost of Adjustment of Investment.   When the cost of&#13;
adjustment on investment is raised from three to five, the resulting&#13;
solution does not change very much. Borrowing and consumption are both&#13;
reduced slightly. Capital formation declines by five percent, but&#13;
actual investment expenditure changes very little from the base run.&#13;
The resulting solution, therefore, is quite similar to the base&#13;
solution. (Figure 5)&#13;
60.      Lower Balanced Growth Rate.   A reduction of the balanced growth&#13;
rate by 0.5 percent from 5.2 percent to 4.7 percent, on the other hand&#13;
has effects that are more substantial than the three tests above.&#13;
(Figure 6) Because of lower expected future income, more resources must&#13;
be transferred to the future. Consumption declines at first by three&#13;
percent. Investment also goes up by 11-16 percent. Borrowing, however,&#13;
is only raised by less than 80 million U.S. dollars. Due to the extra&#13;
capital formation throughout the simulation, the terminal consumption&#13;
levels would be eight percent higher than in the base case.&#13;
61.      The Planning Horizon.   Because of the computational problems&#13;
involved with solving a model with as many non-linearities as ours over&#13;
many periods, we cannot simply lengthen the planning horizon.&#13;
Accordingly, the test of the sensitivity to the short, seven-year,&#13;
transition to balanced growth is performed as follows. We first&#13;
generate a base solution. We then take the values of the capital, labor&#13;
and debt stocks from the beginning of period three and re-run a seven-&#13;
year model. The divergence between these solutions and the original&#13;
ones indicates the sensitivity of our results to the length of the&#13;

planning horizon. (Figure 7).    We see that the assumption of a forced&#13;
balanced growth in the eighth year only has a marked effect on the&#13;
solution  for  years  five,  six  and  seven.    The earlier values    are&#13;
relatively unaffected.&#13;
62.      Summing up, the model is not overly sensitive to the changes in&#13;
parameter values in the utility function, namely "b" and " 6 ", insofar&#13;
as these parameter values stay within reasonable intervals, based on&#13;
empirical work for other countries and on theoretical conjecture.&#13;
Changing the cost of adjustment of investment also has very little&#13;
impact  on the   solution values.     The  terminal  conditions,  however,&#13;
require more attention. A one percentage point change in the balanced&#13;
growth rate could change investment by 20-30 percent, and consumption by&#13;
10 percent. The effect on borrowing, however, is relatively small. To&#13;
the extent that our terminal conditions are derived from the long-run&#13;
historical performance of the Thai economy, the range over which the&#13;
growth rate should reasonably vary is narrow.        Nonetheless, further&#13;
examination, is needed on the terminal conditions in the future.&#13;
III. HISTORY REEXAMINED&#13;
63.      This section uses the model to evaluate Thailand's historical&#13;
borrowing strategy.    First, the economic structure and performance is&#13;
briefly reviewed.    This indicates the role of investment in fuelling&#13;
growth; the growing importance of the manufacturing sector and its&#13;
contribution to exports; the continued vulnerability of export earnings&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
to agricultural supply shocks; and the rapid build-up of foreign debt by&#13;
the public sector associated with a sharp expansion of public&#13;
investment. Second, we present the results of an alternative borrowing&#13;
and investment strategy that would have yielded steadier consumption&#13;
growth without a large debt overhang.      Third, we attempt to explain&#13;
historical behavior in terms of mistaken expectations and limited&#13;
flexibility in macroeconomic adjustment.&#13;
Economic Structure and Performance&#13;
64.      Aggregate indices show that in the past, Thailand has performed&#13;
well relative to the average of middle-income-oil-importing countries&#13;
(MIOIC).   Table 3 compares Thailand with some major countries in the&#13;
region and with averages of MIOICs. Thailand is surpassed only by Korea&#13;
in terms of growth rate of GNP per capita in constant prices between&#13;
1960 and 1982. This good performance comes largely from its high growth&#13;
rate during the 1960s.    Real GDP grew at 8.4 percent p.a.    The growth&#13;
rate slowed down to around seven percent during the 1970s.        This is&#13;
lower than Korea, and oil-exporters (Indonesia, and Malaysia) but still&#13;
substantially higher than the average of MIOICs.&#13;
65.      The slower growth during the 1970s is attributed partially to&#13;
the two oil shocks, and partially to the slow growth in agriculture in&#13;
the second half of the decade caused by volatile weather conditions and&#13;
deteriorating internal and external terms of trade.     Thailand absorbed&#13;
the impact of the first oil shock with relative ease due to the&#13;

contemporaneous and offsetting impact of a price boom for Thai export&#13;
commodities.   It also benefitted from a tight fiscal stance during the&#13;
inflationary  period.    By 1975,   Thailand   shifted  its  attention  to&#13;
regaining  the higher growth rates of the      1960s.    Growth promotion&#13;
measures were therefore introduced.     They included control of certain&#13;
key prices, interest ceilings on domestic credit, raising effective&#13;
rates of protection, and expansion of credit creation. This resulted in&#13;
relatively high growth rates between 1976-1979.     With increased fiscal&#13;
and current account deficits together with the price distortion,&#13;
however, Thailand increased its vulnerability to external shocks.     As a&#13;
result, the second oil shock was much more serious for Thailand than the&#13;
first one.&#13;
66.      Along  with  the  good  growth  performance,   structural  change&#13;
occurred steadily.    Table 4 shows the production structure in current&#13;
price GDP.   The agricultural share of GDP declined from an average 34&#13;
percent during the 1960s to about a quarter in the early 1980s.        The&#13;
manufacturing sector grew from 15 percent to 20 percent of GDP.        The&#13;
agricultural share is still high compared with the average of MIOICs and&#13;
the industrial share low.    This reflects the importance of agriculture&#13;
and  agricultural  exports  in Thailand.     In terms   of growth   rates,&#13;
manufacturing naturally grew fastest.    When we compare the growth rate&#13;
with the major countries in the region, it is again noteworthy that Thai&#13;
manufacturing grew more slowly than all the comparator countries except&#13;
for the Philippines (Table 5). Furthermore, the contribution of&#13;

manufacturing to GDP growth 1/    decreased between 1970-75 and 1975-80,&#13;
while the service sector contribution to GDP growth increased. Thailand&#13;
is the only country that exhibited this combination of changes among the&#13;
five countries compared here.      This rapid expansion of the service&#13;
sector coincides with the period of high foreign capital inflows.       As&#13;
discussed below, one explanation focuses on real overvaluation of the&#13;
baht as a result of the capital inflows causing investment to be&#13;
directed toward the nontradeable service sector.&#13;
67.      Demand.    Table  6 shows   the growth   rates of   final demand&#13;
components.    Private consumption maintains relatively steady growth&#13;
rates despite the slowing down of the aggregate output growth rate.&#13;
Government consumption clearly shows the conservative fiscal stance in&#13;
the early 1970s, and more expansionary measures over the second half of&#13;
the 1970s.    Growth rates of investment and exports oscillate more&#13;
drastically; the latter is a function of continued high dependence on&#13;
agricultural exports which are susceptible to weather conditions.&#13;
68.      Table 7 shows the shares of major exports.        The structural&#13;
change   is  also   clearly  visible   here.     Non-principle   commodity&#13;
manufacturing exports increase their share in total exports from 5.7&#13;
percent in 1970 to 30.4 percent.      The share of principle commodities&#13;
(traditional export goods) declines from 77 percent to 54 percent&#13;
although the absolute level of this type of export is rising.&#13;
1/  This share is defined as       sigi          where   8   is the value-&#13;
added share of sector i in GDP,     gg  is the growth ofi value added of&#13;

The Evolution of Foreign Debt in Thailand&#13;
69.      By   international    comparison,   Thailand's    creditworthiness&#13;
remains strong.    Large amounts were borrowed at 0.125 percent above&#13;
LIBOR both by the public sector and private firms in 1984.        These are&#13;
certainly among the lowest in the international capital market.&#13;
70.      Table 8 presents the overall evolution of debt in Thailand in&#13;
the past.    Table 9 compares growth rates of indebtedness of Thailand&#13;
with those of the major countries in the region.     During the 1970s as a&#13;
whole the average growth of foreign indebtedness of Thailand was similar&#13;
to that   in other developing countries over the same period.          What&#13;
distinguishes Thailand from most other developing countries is the time&#13;
profile of borrowing.     Thailand's growth in external debt was modest&#13;
during the first half of the 1970s when global liquidity was high and&#13;
real interest rate low. Many developing countries borrowed heavily then&#13;
but had to undertake major adjustment measures to mitigate the impacts&#13;
of the second oil shock and the substantial real interest rise during&#13;
the  second  half   of  the  1970s.    By  contrast,   Thailand's  external&#13;
indebtedness accelerated during this period.       The peak in the growth&#13;
rate of total debt came in 1979 and 1980 reaching 50 percent.          This&#13;
coincided with record high nominal (and real) international interest&#13;
rate.&#13;
71.      Table 9 also indicates that the rapid growth in Thailand's&#13;
foreign debt during the second half of the 1970s is mainly attributable&#13;
to the high accumulation of debt by the public sector.         The central&#13;
government and public enterprises increased outstanding debt at a speed&#13;

of 42.6 percent p.a. between 1975 and 1981. Private MLT debt increased&#13;
by only 19 percent p.a. over the same period.     The contrast comes from&#13;
the combination of the private sector's sensitivity to changes in world&#13;
interest rates, and the public sector's tendency to accommodate internal&#13;
imbalances by external borrowing.    I/    The high rate of increase in&#13;
public debt reflected a high public      investment-saving gap.    Public&#13;
savings financed half of public investment during 1970-75. This figure&#13;
goes down to less than 10 percent in 1981.&#13;
72.      Nominal debt statistics overestimate the real growth of debt in&#13;
an inflationary environment. Inflation erodes the real value of assets&#13;
denominated in nominal terms, independently of any flow of funds. Any&#13;
analysis based on a flow of funds that does not take inflation into&#13;
account may be misleading.      For example, a country which borrowed&#13;
heavily in yen at lower nominal interest rates would have smaller&#13;
interest payment, and therefore, higher domestic savings than one which&#13;
borrowed more in US dollars, even if the expected real cost of borrowing&#13;
in these currencies, and hence the underlying macroeconomic positions,&#13;
were identical.&#13;
V See Kharas (1983) for the analysis of the public sector debt, and&#13;
Shishido (1985) for crude estimates of private and public sectors'&#13;
sensitivities to interest rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
73.      In addressing these concerns, two considerations are of special&#13;
relevance.   First, as argued in the preceding paragraph, the real net&#13;
flow of foreign capital into Thailand was substantially less than the&#13;
nominal borrowing rates might suggest. The erosion of the real value of&#13;
debt through inflation results effectively in an amortization of debt&#13;
over and above recorded amortization that can be added to the capital&#13;
account of the country's balance of payments. In order to stay within a&#13;
consistent accounting framework, an offsetting adjustment is made by&#13;
reducing interest payments by an equal amount, thereby reallocating&#13;
total debt service between the current and capital account, while hold-&#13;
ing its amount constant. Even after this adjustment is carried out, and&#13;
the country's real accumulation of net foreign liabilities has been&#13;
estimated, it is apparent that there was indeed a high and probably un-&#13;
sustainable real rate of accumulation of foreign obligations toward the&#13;
end of the 1970s (Table 10) reaching almost six percent of GDP in&#13;
1979.   In 1980 and 1981, however, this rate dropped to three to four&#13;
percent; more recently, with world inflation much reduced, the adjusted&#13;
current account deficit will be close to the recorded deficits of five&#13;
to seven percent.&#13;
74.      The second consideration relates to the type of adjustment pro-&#13;
cess that took place during the late 1970s and early 1980s. The deteri-&#13;
oration in the terms of trade that has occurred over this period requir-&#13;
ed structural changes in expenditure patterns.      Consumption should be&#13;
reduced in response to the decline in real income, whereas real invest-&#13;
ment needs may be increased to hasten changes in the pattern of&#13;

production. Net resource transfers from abroad can be useful in speed-&#13;
ing up the adjustment process especially if channelled into productive&#13;
investments in support of structural adjustment without imposing an un-&#13;
due reduction in consumption. In assessing the changes in real resource&#13;
transfers in Thailand it is possible to decompose the total annual&#13;
change into a component associated with structural changes in real in-&#13;
vestment and consumption and into a component required by changes in the&#13;
price of investment and consumption relative to the GDP deflator. 1,&#13;

Table 11 shows the results. During 1975-76, the transfer was less than&#13;
the 1970/72 average due to the slow-down in investment, and acompanying&#13;
decline in prices of capital goods.      In 1977, the transfer starts to&#13;
pick up primarily caused by the higher share of real investment in&#13;
GDP.   Later in 1980 and 1981, real investment slows down, but the need&#13;
for the transfer is kept high by an increase in the relative price of&#13;
capital goods.    If real investment demand had continued to grow at&#13;
similar rates seen in 1977-79, the demand forforeign resources would&#13;
have been much higher in 1980/81 because of the high capital goods&#13;
price.&#13;
75.      This review illustrates certain features of the Thai economy&#13;
that provide the empirical underpinnings of the analysis.     First, high&#13;
nominal borrowing has been associated with high levels of real resource&#13;
transfers to the economy.    This has not always been the case.    In many&#13;
other countries, high borrowing was associated with world inflation and&#13;
with private capital flight. Second, the additional resources have, for&#13;
the most part, been used for investment. Third, the continued high per&#13;
capita GDP growth suggests that rates of return in Thailand are high.&#13;
Fourth, the economy has been diversifying output and exports by building&#13;
up a substantial manufacturing base.     These facts give the impression&#13;
that behavior may have been appropriate, despite the rapid growth of&#13;
debt. They highlight the key issues in assessing past borrowing:&#13;
(i)     how much should Thailand have borrowed?&#13;
(ii)     what were the costs and consequences of actual borrowing?&#13;
(iii)     what institutional features contributed to overborrowing?&#13;
&#13;

Base Optimization Run and Reality&#13;
76.      Dynamic optimization is used to derive the optimum path of the&#13;
economy, using investment and net borrowing in each year as control var-&#13;
iables.  The terminal conditions, as described earlier, impose a balanc-&#13;
ed growth rate after the last period.    Dynamic optimization, by defini-&#13;
tion,  takes   into  account  what   happens  throughout  the   simulation&#13;
periods. The major features of the Thai economy and the world environ-&#13;
ment during the simulation period (1975-81) are as follows. The nominal&#13;
world interest rates Thailand faced at the margin ranged from 8-9 per-&#13;
cent during 1975-77 to 11 percent in 1978 and finally 13.8 percent in&#13;
1980-1981.  The Thais were paying 8.5 percent average interest on loans&#13;
from official sources committed in 1981. International prices increased&#13;
by at most nine percent annually, except for 1979 when they went up by&#13;
21 percent due mostly to the second oil shock. This external inflation&#13;
eroded the real value of the stock of foreign debt, but it raised the&#13;
cost of import, especially the cost of importing capital equipment. The&#13;
world demand for manufacturing goods in general grew at a rate of 4-6&#13;
percent p.a., but a significant slow down was witnessed in 1981 as a&#13;
result of the widespread recession among OECD countries.&#13;
77.      The domestic environment was not so negative.       Agricultural&#13;
exports showed an encouraging upward trend. Rubber related exports in-&#13;
creased in value from 3.5 billion bahts in 1975 to 10.8 billion in&#13;
1981. Non-processed agricultural exports went up from 6.9 billion bahts&#13;
in 1975 to 14.2 billion in 1981.       Rice remained the most important&#13;
single agricultural crop - exports rose from 5.9 to 26 billion bahts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
during the same period, supported by a slower growth of domestic demand&#13;
than production.   Under these conditions, what would have been the ap-&#13;
propriate paths of foreign borrowing and investment? In order to answer&#13;
this question, the model was solved sequentially: first, for the years&#13;
1975-81, and second, for years 1978-84.     The second version was solved&#13;
with the debt, labor and capital stocks of 1978 given by the first ver-&#13;
sion as the initial conditions. This was done in order to minimize the&#13;
impact of too short a planning horizon. We therefore look at only 1975-&#13;
77 of the first version, and 1978-81 of the second.&#13;
78.      The optimal solution given by the model can be compared with&#13;
actual behavior.   To ease comparison, this latter is taken as the re-&#13;
sults of a recursive CGE simulation in which actual levels of investment&#13;
and  borrowing  are  exogenously   inserted. 1/.     The  results  of  the&#13;
calibration exercise (paras. 52-54) show this to be a reasonable&#13;
approximation. Figure 8 illustrates optimal and actual levels for key&#13;
macroeconomic variables. In general, there is a close correspondence in&#13;
the early years, 1975-78. If anything, Thailand could have borrowed&#13;
I/ The reason for not using actual history, as published for example in&#13;
the World Tables, is that we must allocate statistical discrepancies and&#13;
changes in stocks to the variables considered in the model. Also, we&#13;
wish to compare price changes for which no historical series are&#13;
available (see para. 54). Discussion of real figures is in 1975 prices.&#13;

more in these years given the low nominal and real interest rates. The&#13;
extra borrowing would have financed more investment in order to enhance&#13;
productive capacity in the future when international conditions would&#13;
deteriorate.   Consumption is very close to optimum levels during this&#13;
period.&#13;
79.      During 1979-81, however, after the nominal interest rate rise,&#13;
oil price hike, and the slow-down in world demand became apparent, a&#13;
significant divergence between actual and optimal behavior emerges.&#13;
Foreign borrowing should have been 54, 53, and 64 percent below actual&#13;
levels in 1979, 1980, and 1981 respectively. This reduction in foreign&#13;
resources should have been translated into lower consumption, especially&#13;
in 1980 and 1981.   The shocks that impinged on the economy were perman-&#13;
ent in nature and required an adjustment of consumption to sustainable&#13;
long-run levels. Investment, on the other hand, is reasonably close to&#13;
historical levels.    A sharp fall is observed in 1979, reflecting both&#13;
high international real interest rates and high costs of importing capi-&#13;
tal equipment. By 1981, however, investment recovers.&#13;
80.      An immediate consequence of these changes, especially the low&#13;
optimal borrowing levels, is to reduce the appreciation of the real ex-&#13;
change rate. The actual experience shows a sharp appreciation of about&#13;
17 percent between 1975 and 1978 and then stabilization at this level.&#13;
The gradual depreciation aftet the external shocks hit the economy would&#13;
have increased the labor force in the manufacturing sector and would&#13;
have redirected the allocation of investment towards tradeables and away&#13;
from  non-tradeables.     The  result   would  have  been  production   of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
tradeables some 17 percent higher than actual production in 1981. This&#13;
would have supported a higher value of manufactured exports of 30&#13;
percent and lower competitive imports of 10 percent.&#13;
81.      In order to generate the local and foreign demand for domestic&#13;
tradeables, the price must be held below international prices.      In our&#13;
model, with a fixed nominal exchange rate, this can only be achieved by&#13;
tight control of inflation.    Not only must the level of the tradeable&#13;
good price be held below international prices, but it must also increase&#13;
relative to the non-traded goods sector to achieve the required shift of&#13;
resources to the traded sector.    As a result, the model solution shows&#13;
significantly lower inflation rates than actual levels.    If these could&#13;
not have been controlled through monetary policy, then equivalent rela-&#13;
tive price changes would have necessitated earlier nominal exchange rate&#13;
devaluations.&#13;
82.      A second consequence of excessive borrowing is the emergence of&#13;
a significant debt overhang that must be serviced.      Along the optimal&#13;
path, the debt/exports ratio would have risen gradually from 0.53 in&#13;
1975 to 0.67 in 1981.    In reality, it reached   0.8 in 1981.    Although&#13;
this permitted higher consumption during 1979-81, it jeopardizes the&#13;
future long-run sustainable level of consumption. This point is illus-&#13;
trated in Figure 9.   If we assume that the economy were to reach a bal-&#13;
anced growth rate in 1981, then the associated level of consumption&#13;
would have to fall from its 1980 value, before resuming an upward&#13;

trend. On the other hand, in the optimal solution, the capital stock is&#13;
higher than actual by 1981 while debt and debt service obligations are&#13;
substantially lower. Thus, the long-run sustainable consumption path is&#13;
correspondingly higher.   This more than offsets the reduced welfare in&#13;
1979-81, when historical consumption exceeds optimal levels by 3-10&#13;
percent.&#13;
History Reexamined&#13;
83.      The previous section shows that Thailand's actual borrowing and&#13;
investment strategies diverged from those produced by a full-information&#13;
optimization solution. The divergence has different characteristics in&#13;
two sub-periods,   1975-78 and 1979-81.    In the former, borrowing was&#13;
about right but the mix of domestic expenditure was tilted towards con-&#13;
sumption and away from investment. In the latter period, borrowing was&#13;
too high, helping to finance continued consumption growth and an over-&#13;
appreciated real exchange rate, rather than contributing to the higher&#13;
investment which would have been warranted to achieve structural adjust-&#13;
ment. This section examines the possible sources of the divergence bet-&#13;
ween actual and optimal borrowing strategies.     There are three.   First&#13;
the optimization model assumes full information. That is, the proposed&#13;
strategy is generated with the advantage of hindsight. This may be un-&#13;
reasonable in reality. Policy makers may have found that actual events&#13;
deviated from their ex ante perceptions. We consider three likely fore-&#13;
casting errors:   failure to anticipate (i) the rise in interest rates&#13;
from 1978 on; (ii) the surge in global inflation associated with the&#13;
1979 rise in oil prices and (iii) the slow-down in world trade growth as&#13;

the OECD business cycle turned downward.     Second, it is possible that&#13;
even after these events happened policy-makers failed to perceive the&#13;
nature of the shock correctly. Expectations that the changes in inter-&#13;
est rates and world trade were temporary phenomena, rather than the&#13;
medium-term phenomena that they have proven to be, could have been a&#13;
second source of error.    Third, it is possible that Thailand may have&#13;
had certain non-economic objectives, such as the avoidance of political&#13;
difficulties that might have followed a strategy in which national con-&#13;
sumption was reduced to achieve adjustment to external shocks. Each of&#13;
these requires specification of a different set of assumptions under&#13;
which borrowing and investment strategies are chosen. These are discus-&#13;
sed below.&#13;
External disturbances&#13;
84.      Higher interest rate.    Figure 10 shows the effects of expect-&#13;
ing, in 1975, that nominal interest rates in 1978 and thereafter would&#13;
be one percentage point below actual levels.     The initial impact is to&#13;
increase borrowing during the period 1975-77. This is because of lower&#13;
expected future costs of servicing the debt and, correspondingly, higher&#13;
national income. On average, annual foreign borrowing would have been&#13;
higher than in the base solution by $150 million.      Most of this would&#13;
have gone to finance higher consumption.     Investment levels would have&#13;
been barely affected.    This is because of two opposing tendencies.    On&#13;
the one hand, lower expected interest charges tend to raise the incen-&#13;
tives to invest. But, on the other hand, the higher levels of borrowing&#13;

lead to an appreciation of the real exchange rate and a rise in real&#13;
wages, reducing the profitability of new investment.&#13;
85.      Once interest rates rise in 1978 above their anticipated level&#13;
to the actual level, the impact is greater. We assume, first, that pol-&#13;
icy-makers correctly perceived the rise in interest rates to be the&#13;
first stage of an era of higher world interest and adjusted up their&#13;
expectations of future interest rates as well (denoted as UAP in&#13;
figures) Then, borrowing and consumption would have immediately adjust-&#13;
ed down to the base case levels. Although there would be an overhang of&#13;
excessive debt because of the forecasting error, there should not have&#13;
been any tendency to rectify this by a period of underborrowing.        To&#13;
meet the higher interest payments, however, resources would have needed&#13;
to shift into the traded goods sector. This would be achieved by rever-&#13;
sing the appreciation of the real exchange rate.&#13;
86.      If, on the other hand, the interest rate rise was perceived to&#13;
be temporary, (denoted as TMP in figures) with no change in expectations&#13;
of future interest rates, then the pattern is one of delayed adjust-&#13;
ment.   We assume that each year, borrowing decisions are made on the&#13;
basis of expected future interest rates one percentage point below ac-&#13;
tual levels.    Consumption remains higher than the base solution, and&#13;
higher than the case where the interest shock is considered to be perma-&#13;
nent. This is financed by higher foreign borrowing of almost $250 mil-&#13;
lion per year.   Again, investment is unaffected by the forecast error.&#13;
The real exchange rate, however, becomes more overvalued, to accommodate&#13;
the higher borrowing and consumption levels.     Thus, resources continue&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
to be misallocated away from the manufacturing sector. In summary, the&#13;
failure to treat higher interest rates as a medium-term phenemenon part-&#13;
ly explains the overborrowing in 1978-80.&#13;
87.      Slower world trade growth.    World demand for Thailand's manu-&#13;
facturing exports grew at 7 percent annually in 1975-78, but only 4 per-&#13;
cent from 1978-81. Assume that policy-makers anticipated higher volumes&#13;
of world trade than actual, by 10 percent in each year after 1978. How&#13;
would the borrowing and investment strategies have looked?      Figure 11&#13;
shows the results.   Consider first the early period 1975-78.      Actions&#13;
are affected by the anticipation of high future world demand for ex-&#13;
ports. Accordingly, investment rises even higher than the base solution&#13;
(which in turn exceeded historical investment), to build up capacity in&#13;
manufacturing.   At the same time, the rate of appreciation of the real&#13;
exchange rate is slowed down, again helping to divert resources to&#13;
tradeables production.   Consumption remains essentially unchanged.    The&#13;
extra investment is fully financed by additional foreign borrowing, so&#13;
that although output grows over time, debt servicing requirements also&#13;
rise, leaving national wealth unaffected.&#13;
88.      When the high world demand fails to materialize in 1978, ad-&#13;
justment must occur.    Again, assume first that expectations of future&#13;
world demand are also revised down (UAP in figures).       The economy is&#13;
left with an excessive stock of debt, but with a production capacity&#13;
biased  towards tradeables.     This mitigates the need for structural&#13;
change. The burden of adjustment falls on investment, the level of&#13;

- 79 -&#13;
which drops sharply below the previously planned target. New borrowing,&#13;
too, is cut back to the base solution levels. Thus, although the value&#13;
of exports and the growth of exports are both severely affected by the&#13;
shortfall in demand, the deficit and new borrowing do not grow. Reduc-&#13;
tions in absorption (investment) and switching policies through an ex-&#13;
change rate depreciation bring imports down.&#13;
89.      This scenario changes significantly when the world slow-down is&#13;
believed to be temporary.     Assume now that policy-makers viewed the&#13;
slow-down as a transitory phenomenon associated with a global business&#13;
cycle of three years duration, which would be reversed thenceforth (TMP3&#13;
in figure).    Then investment continues to rise even after the dip in&#13;
world demand. This is partly financed by domestic savings and partly by&#13;
higher foreign borrowing. The growth rate of debt shoots up, predicated&#13;
on high expected future exports. This simply represents the traditional&#13;
maxim that one should borrow through a temporary shock.        What is of&#13;
interest here is the magnitude of such borrowing. Even in the face of a&#13;
substantial unanticipated "temporary" short-fall in world demand, it is&#13;
difficult to justify Thai borrowing levels in the amounts prevailing in&#13;
1979-81. At the same time, a shock of this nature does not help to ex-&#13;
plain the deviations of consumption and investment from their optimal&#13;
paths. On the contrary, the higher borrowing would have been associated&#13;
with even higher investment than in the base solution.&#13;
90.      Higher import prices.    Fuelled by the rise in oil prices and&#13;
the adjustment policies followed by the OECD countries, import prices,&#13;
including those for capital equipment, rose steeply in Thailand.      From&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
1975-78, the rise in the import unit value index was 6 percent; from&#13;
1978-80 it was 14 percent, and then stabilized in 1981. We simulate the&#13;
initial expectations of import prices as a constant rise of 7 percent&#13;
from 1979 on.    This means that prices were expected to be lower than&#13;
actual by 13-14 percent in 1979 and 1980.        The effects are of two&#13;
kinds. First, there is an anticipation of better terms of trade for the&#13;
country, and hence a presumption of higher national wealth.        Second,&#13;
there is an expectation that the cost of imported, non-competitive capi-&#13;
tal equipment, a key component of investment, will rise at a slower pace&#13;
in the future.   This encourages investors to delay the installation of&#13;
fixed capital.&#13;
91.      The results are shown in Figure 12.      The impact on the early&#13;
years, 1975-78, is to lower investment, and raise consumption. The lat-&#13;
ter is due to the higher perceived wealth. One consequence is an appre-&#13;
ciation of the real exchange rate, despite a decline in foreign&#13;
borrowing associated with lower investment. These shifts bring modelled&#13;
consumption and investment behavior close to the historically observed&#13;
patterns.&#13;
92.      Once higher prices are observed in 1979, an adjustment is re-&#13;
quired (UAP in figure). With future expectations of world import price&#13;
inflation raised, it becomes attractive to raise investment slightly&#13;
above base run levels, and close to historical levels.     Foreign borrow-&#13;
ing also increases somewhat to finance this. The combination of higher&#13;
investment and foreign borrowing lead to initial appreciation of the&#13;

depreciaton and is instrumental in directing resources towards manufac-&#13;
turing.&#13;
Consumption Constraint&#13;
93.      One feature of the base case scenario is that per capita util-&#13;
ity declines relative to the previous year in 1978, 1980 and 1981. This&#13;
may be politically difficult to achieve. Alternatively, our assumption&#13;
of an additive, separable utility function may be too strong.      Accord-&#13;
ingly, we impose a constraint that forces per capita utility in each&#13;
year to grow by at least 1.6 percent over the previous assumption of an&#13;
additive, separable utility function may be too strong. Accordingly, we&#13;
impose a constraing that forces per capital utility in each year to grow&#13;
by at least 1.6 percent over the previous year. This precludes flexible&#13;
adjustment to disturbances by an abrupt reduction of consumption.      The&#13;
new solution to the constrained optimization problem is shown in Figure&#13;
13.   Consumption and investment are now closer to historical levels.&#13;
Given foreknowledge of the constraint, the solution leads to a slow-down&#13;
in the growth rate of consumption in 1979, but leads to higher consump-&#13;
tion than the base case in 1980 and 1981.      This is financed by lower&#13;
investment, however, and not by increased foreign borrowing; the latter&#13;
is even lower than in the base case.&#13;
Historical Summary&#13;
94.      For the most part, Thailand's borrowing and investment strate-&#13;
gies appear to have been close to optimum levels.    This is particularly&#13;
so in the early years of high non-concessional borrowing, 1975-78. The&#13;

rapid build-up of debt during this period was justifiable given the pre-&#13;
vailing low real interest rates and high returns on domestic invest-&#13;
ment. Although the pattern of domestic absorption seems slightly tilted&#13;
towards overconsumption and underinvestment, this is readily explained&#13;
by reference to excessively optimistic expectations about future devel-&#13;
opments, either on interest rates, world demand or import prices.&#13;
Thailand would have borrowed more and consumed more had they anticipated&#13;
lower interest rates, lower import prices or higher export demand&#13;
towards the end of the decade.    They would have invested less had they&#13;
failed to anticipate the rapid rise in the prices of imported capital&#13;
equipment that was to occur in 1979-80.&#13;
95.      Thus, Thailand entered a period of a volatile, and adverse,&#13;
world environment with slightly less capital stock than desirable.      In&#13;
addition, because of the appreciation of the real exchange rate due to&#13;
overconsumption, the distribution of this capital stock was biased to-&#13;
wards the non-traded sector and away from manufacturing tradeables.&#13;
This made the economy more vulnerable to the subsequent external shocks.&#13;
96.      During  the second   sub-period,  1979-81,  a marked divergence&#13;
emerges between optimum strategies and historical paths.        Given the&#13;
deterioration in world conditions, consumption and foreign borrowing&#13;
should have been reduced and investment stabilized to achieve an adjust-&#13;
ment of productive capacity. In addition, a sizeable real depreciation&#13;
of the baht was desirable.        Such adjustments,   however,  never did&#13;
occur. Foreign borrowing and consumption accelerated. Investment rose&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
at a more moderate pace than desirable.     The magnitude of this diver-&#13;
gence, especially with respect to consumption and foreign borrowing,&#13;
cannot be easily explained by forecasting errors, as in the earlier&#13;
period. Simulations with unanticipated shocks show a pattern of adjust-&#13;
ment similar to the perfect foresight case.    Despite the slight ex post&#13;
facto mistakes in the early period, the new borrowing and investment&#13;
strategy should quickly converge to the base solution: that is, stabil-&#13;
ized investment, with a sharp switch in its financing towards domestic&#13;
sources (reduced consumption) and away from foreign borrowing.&#13;
97.      Two alternative explanations for the historical evolution of&#13;
the macroeconomy are presented. The first is that despite evidence that&#13;
global conditions were deteriorating, Thai policy-makers failed to re-&#13;
vise their expectations about the future, treating high interest rate&#13;
and low world demand changes as temporary phenomena whereas they have&#13;
proven to be of a medium term nature.     However, while mistaken percep-&#13;
tions on the permanent or temporary nature of high interest rates would&#13;
help to explain foreign borrowing and consumption behavior, they would&#13;
also imply a greater divergence between simulated and actual invest-&#13;
ment. A similar inconsistency emerges in explanations of past behavior&#13;
that focus on a perceived temporary slow-down in world demand.        This&#13;
can, therefore, only be part of the full explanation.&#13;
98.      The alternative story suggests that non-economic factors, or&#13;
non-optimizing behavior, were important in this period.    One feature of&#13;
the desired adjustment path is several years (1978, 1980, 1981) without&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -&#13;
any expansion in per capita consumption.    This may not have been poss-&#13;
ible to achieve politically.   The imposition of an arbitrary constraint&#13;
on adjustment that forces per capita utility to rise by at least 1.6&#13;
percent generates a solution with higher consumption, but without higher&#13;
borrowing.&#13;
99.      The difficulty in explaining the high levels of foreign borrow-&#13;
ing in 1980 and 1981 partly suggests that market forces, on which our&#13;
model behavior rests, were being distorted by government policy. Sever-&#13;
al features of this period stand out.     The results clearly show that a&#13;
desirable program of adjustment to the adverse world development should&#13;
have included a depreciation of the real exchange-rate.     The historical&#13;
real exchange rate was overvalued by about 10 percent. An official ob-&#13;
jective, however, was to retain the system of a fixed nominal parity of&#13;
the baht against the dollar. When this system came under pressure, re-&#13;
flected in a run-down of reserves, the government failed to take adequ-&#13;
ate measures to reduce balance of payments pressure by a more austere&#13;
fiscal stance.   Instead, loose fiscal policy and a growing overall pub-&#13;
lic deficit were supported by public foreign borrowing especially by&#13;
state enterprises.    It was only when fears of the problems associated&#13;
with rapidly rising indebtedness became acute that action was taken to&#13;
devalue the baht and reduce public external borrowing.      Thus, foreign&#13;
borrowing was not the result of a decision on least cost sources of fin-&#13;
ance in this period.     The authorities did not internalize the rising&#13;
cost of external borrowing into their decision-making, and failed to&#13;
substitute these funds with lower cost domestic resources.&#13;

IV. STRATEGIES FOR THE FUTURE&#13;
100.     This  section  presents medium-term borrowing and     investment&#13;
strategies for the future, based on the parameters calibrated for the&#13;
past. The successful performance of the model in explaining past behav-&#13;
ior and in generating borrowing and investment strategies that look&#13;
reasonable from an ex post perspective generates some confidence that&#13;
the results for the future are not too sensitive to arbitrary choices of&#13;
the parameters.   Nevertheless, the main purpose of this section is to&#13;
explore the qualitative magnitudes of changes in response to unantic-&#13;
ipated disturbances, rather than to make projections of what will or&#13;
should occur. Our simulation period covers 1985-92, which includes the&#13;
entire Sixth Plan. We first proceed to describe the risk-return trade-&#13;
off, then choose one point as the base case and finally discuss the mod-&#13;
ifications in the strategy as exogenous conditions change.&#13;
The Risk-Return Trade-Off&#13;
101.     The analysis of the past was conducted under conditions of cer-&#13;
tainty that credit availability would be forthcoming from lenders. This&#13;
is a reasonable approximation for that period, both because of the high&#13;
liquidity in the international banking system and generally favorable&#13;
track-record of developing country loans and because Thailand was a&#13;
small borrower from international capital markets relative to the size&#13;
of its economy and its exports. These factors are no longer representa-&#13;
tive of the actual situation.    Concern over preserving market access in&#13;
the future is an important determinant of the borrowing strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
102.     The availability of funds is ensured in our model through the&#13;
incorporation of a lending constraint. This is based on the balance of&#13;
payments and government revenue positions in the balanced growth&#13;
state.   The former is a re-statement of the terminal conditions.       It&#13;
states that lenders will be prepared to lend as long as the net present&#13;
value of their debt tends to zero.&#13;
-rt&#13;
lim    D(t) e   =  0&#13;
t + X&#13;
The balanced growth conditions give us the path of debt over time as a&#13;
function of debt outstanding in the terminal year of the planning hori-&#13;
zon. The lenders' transversality condition then simply implies that the&#13;
balanced growth increase in the stock of debt be less than the interest&#13;
rate. Lenders will also, however, take note of the government's fiscal&#13;
position. I/ If debt service can only be met by continued net resource&#13;
transfers from lenders to the government, then the expected value of the&#13;
outstanding debt is low.    Thus, we force the surplus of the government&#13;
sector (tax revenue plus net new borrowing minus expenditure minus&#13;
l/ Econometric work (Kharas and Shishido, 1984) indicates the&#13;
significance of this in actual lender behavior.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

interest payments) to be greater than an arbitrary constant along the&#13;
balanced growth path.    Coupled with the lenders' transversality condi-&#13;
tion, this ensures that the expected value of debt at the end of the&#13;
planning horizon equals its nominal value and, hence, given risk-neutral&#13;
lenders, that new funds will be made available along the transition&#13;
path.   The arbitrary constant of the government revenue surplus can be&#13;
thought of as a measure of the risk of the end-period debt. The higher&#13;
its value, the shorter the time horizon until debt could be paid off and&#13;
the less risky it is. In turn, less risky future debt implies less risk&#13;
of lenders not making available the funds required over the transitional&#13;
path.&#13;
103.     Figure 14 shows welfare as a function of the borrowing and in-&#13;
vestment strategies chosen.     These are summarized by the outstanding&#13;
debt and capital stocks in the terminal year.     For any given level of&#13;
debt, welfare increases as the capital stock increases upto a certain&#13;
point and then diminishes as overinvestment occurs. Conversely, for any&#13;
level of investment, welfare rises with higher borrowing up to a point&#13;
after which diminishing returns set in. Our formulation of the lending&#13;
constraint permits us to define risk explicitly as a function of the&#13;
end-period capital and debt stocks.    In general, higher capital stocks&#13;
and lower debt result in lower risk.&#13;
104.     By exogenously changing borrowing levels, and devising the op-&#13;
timal level of investment associated with each level of borrowing, we&#13;
can trace a sequence of debt-capital coordinates that keep the level of&#13;

risk constant.   AH- OH- BH    is the iso-risk curve when the risk para-&#13;
meter value is such that the lending constraint is never binding.&#13;
Clearly, the economy tends to    0H   by trying to maximize welfare, for&#13;
the given risk level.    Similarly,   AL - 0L - BL  is an iso-risk curve&#13;
that is associated with the lower risk level of our choice. This curve&#13;
is where the hyperplane formed by the lending constraint cuts through&#13;
the welfare surface. It shows that an even larger amount of investment&#13;
is required for a country to stay on the same risk level when it&#13;
overborrows.   Once again, the economy chooses the point     0L    through&#13;
welfare maximization.   The points   0H  and 0L   explicitly characterize&#13;
the optimal risk-return trade-off.   The line  0H - 0L - C  is a sequence&#13;
of such optimal levels of debt-capital mixes at varying levels of assoc-&#13;
iated risk.&#13;
105.     Two characteristics of   0L   are worth noting.   First, it will&#13;
never be at the unconstrained welfare optimum,     0H *  The intuition is&#13;
straighforward. At this level of borrowing and investment, a small de-&#13;
cline in borrowing and/or increase in investment will lead to no change&#13;
in welfare (by definition of the optimum) but a reduction in risk.      If&#13;
risk minimization is valued, some movement in this direction is called&#13;
for.   This provides an important justification for active government&#13;
macroeconomic management. In a pure laissez-faire environment, individ-&#13;
ual maximizing agents would end up at     0H  because no individual takes&#13;
into account macro issues, such as national creditworthiness preserva-&#13;
tion, in making decisions. Second, risk aversion implies that for any&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
given level of borrowing, investment will be higher than the uncon-&#13;
strained welfare maximizing level.     Conversely, for any given invest-&#13;
ment, borrowing will be lower than the welfare maximizing levels. Thus,&#13;
0L cannot fall anywhere in Figure 14, but lies within a much narrower&#13;
range, i.e., along   0H - 0L - C   .    This implies that the failure to&#13;
incorporate uncertainty explicitly is unlikely to alter dramatically the&#13;
qualititive properties of the solution.&#13;
The Base Case&#13;
106.     The base case results from the choice of an arbitrary parameter&#13;
to reflect risk. It is also conditional on domestic and external condi-&#13;
tions. -l The model parameters are the same as in the history run, with&#13;
minor changes. The Hicks-neutral production coefficients are fixed at&#13;
the 1979-81 average levels. Initial values of the capital stock in each&#13;
sector for 1985 have been derived by extending the recursive CGE simul-&#13;
ation between 1981-1985 with investment and foreign borrowing fixed at&#13;
historical levels.&#13;
107.     The modeling framework developed can be used to determine bor-&#13;
rowing and investment.    The period chosen is 1985-1992.    We can carry&#13;
I/ The latter are identical to the assumptions used in World Bank&#13;
country economic projections, e.g, May (1985).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -&#13;
out our analysis within the framework and policy objectives of the Sixth&#13;
Five Year Plan because our future simulation period includes the Sixth&#13;
Plan Period entirely.    We first proceed to describe the base path pro-&#13;
jected by the extension of the model used for examining history.         We&#13;
then examine the change in the solution depending on changes in assump-&#13;
tions of the future world environment (world interest, commodity prices&#13;
and trade volume) and domestic factors.&#13;
108.     As in the case of the analysis of the history, the future bor-&#13;
rowing and investment path depends crucially on how the exogenous domes-&#13;
tic and world variables are expected to evolve. Rubber and nonprocessed&#13;
agricultural exports are exogenous, their values are taken from Bank&#13;
staff projections of volume and price. They grow at an average 9 percent&#13;
nominally and 2 percent real.     Manufacturing exports include all non-&#13;
traditional manufacturing exports and the products of food processing&#13;
industry.   We assume that the world demand schedule for these exports&#13;
will grow at 10-12 percent per year in real terms at each relative&#13;
price.&#13;
109.     World  prices of foreign manufacturing goods are taken from&#13;
international price indices (IPI) estimated by Bank staff. The IPI goes&#13;
up by 9 percent in 1985, then falls to 6 percent and stabilizes at 4&#13;
percent.   The world nominal interest rate on nonconcessional loans is&#13;
11.8 percent; official loans carry a 4.5 percent interest change.       The&#13;
volume of official loans is fixed at around 6-700 million US dollars.&#13;
The cost of adjustment parameter on foreign borrowing      (vb)  is assumed&#13;
to be 0.4, about half of what was used in the history model.       This re-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
flects the development of the Thai domestic financial sector, which is&#13;
now able to handle much larger amounts of debt without incurring further&#13;
cost.   The nominal exchange rate is pegged at 26.5 bahts/US dollar.&#13;
The supply of natural gas is taken to be lowest of the various projec-&#13;
tions currently made, with the dollar price per standard cubic feet fix-&#13;
ed nominally at present levels.      This gives a pessimistic picture.&#13;
Higher gas values are analyzed through sensitivity analyses.&#13;
110.     Based on these assumptions, the macroeconomy should evolve as&#13;
follows:       Foreign Borrowing:   The current account deficit would be&#13;
5.3 percent of GDP in 1985, the same as in 1984 reflecting the&#13;
rise in investment that is expected following the improvement&#13;
in competitiveness created by the recent devaluation.       This&#13;
deficit will be rapidly reduced over time.      In the balanced&#13;
steady growth state the deficit would be 1.2 percent. This, in&#13;
absolute terms, means a decline of net new borrowing (gross&#13;
borrowing - principle repayment) from 3.3 billion IJS dollars in&#13;
1985 to 2.3 billion in 1992.    The debt-to-export ratio starts&#13;
at 1.13 in 1985, peaks at 1.15 in 1986, then quickly falls to a&#13;
steady-state level of 0.76.   Net transfers (net borrowing less&#13;
interest payment) are negative from 1989.    This is an inevit-&#13;
able stage in the debt cycle.   Promoting positive net resource&#13;
transfers through higher borrowing would not be justifiable.&#13;
Growth:   GDP would expand at the average rate of 7.5 percent&#13;
p.a. High levels of capital formation support this growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
The growth rate of the tradeable sector (manufacturing) is con-&#13;
sistently high at around nine percent p.a.     With the initial&#13;
large foreign capital inflows, however, the real exchange rate&#13;
appreciates, raising the profitability of the nontradeable&#13;
(service) sector.   Over time, as new borrowing falls and debt&#13;
service mounts, the real exchange rate must depreciate. Then,&#13;
growth in the manufacturing sector accelerates, while it slows&#13;
down in the service sector. The share of manufacturing sector&#13;
value added in current GDP, therefore, rises from 20 percent to&#13;
27 percent in 1991. This structural change is a necessary con-&#13;
sequence of effective use of foreign borrowing.&#13;
Trade:   The inability of Thailand to continue receiving posi-&#13;
tive net resource transfers from international capital markets&#13;
implies that its trade position must also narrow sharply,&#13;
despite continued expected growth in non-factor service in-&#13;
flows.  Exports must expand strongly.    The share of exports in&#13;
GDP would grow from 17 to 25 percent by 1991.       Thailand is,&#13;
however, still dependent on agriculture for two-thirds of its&#13;
exports.    The potential   for further expansion is limited.&#13;
Thus, it is manufacturing exports that must rise. Real growth&#13;
in these averages between 14-19 percent, considerably faster&#13;
than world demand.    This can only be achieved, therefore, by&#13;
compressing domestic price increases for manufactures below&#13;
world price increases by 3-4 percent per year. A variety of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -&#13;
export promotion polices, including active exchange-rate man-&#13;
agement, would be required to generate this sustained improve-&#13;
ment  in competitiveness.     Imports would grow as well, but&#13;
slower, in real terms, than GDP.       Competitive manufacturing&#13;
imports would grow by 6-7 percent reflecting a limited amount&#13;
of import substitution. Because of the need to generate a real&#13;
depreciation, however, the value share of imports would&#13;
continue to rise slowly from 20 percent to 24 percent by 1991.&#13;
Private Consumption:    Private consumption grows in real terms&#13;
by 6 percent p.a.; 1.5 percent less than the average of GDP&#13;
growth rate p.a. This is because, with the rising debt service&#13;
obligations and the narrowed resource gap of the economy later&#13;
in the simulation, domestic savings have to finance an increas-&#13;
ing share of investment.   Real depreciation helps achieve this&#13;
end. The consumption of tradeables, as a result ,increases&#13;
even more slowly; 3.5 percent annually compared to 9.2 percent&#13;
for nontradeable consumption.&#13;
Public Finance:   Government revenue from domestic sources con-&#13;
sists of income taxes, indirect taxes and tariffs on competi-&#13;
tive imports.    All these are fixed at historical average ad&#13;
valorem rates.    The share of the revenue in total GDP is,&#13;
therefore, relatively fixed at 16 percent throughout the simul-&#13;
ation. Government consumption on the other hand is exogenously&#13;
given and grows at 5 percent annually in real terms. I For ac-&#13;
counting purposes, public investment is assumed to be one-third&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -&#13;
of the total domestic capital     formation.    The net foreign&#13;
transfer to the public sector declines quite rapidly as new&#13;
borrowing drops and debt service obligations accumulate.    Con-&#13;
sequently, the aggregate public surplus, tax revenue plus bor-&#13;
rowing less government consumption and investment, minus debt&#13;
service payments, shows a rapid decline.&#13;
The Laissez-Faire Solution&#13;
111.     The base path of the future described above incorporates some&#13;
public intervention to reduce the risk that credit markets will suddenly&#13;
stop lending to Thailand.     By constraining the present value of the&#13;
long-run net public sector income to be nonnegative, it is effectively&#13;
constraining the amount the country can borrow.      What happens in the&#13;
absence of such considerations is now explored (Figure 15).&#13;
112.     Thailand would borrow six percent more foreign loans in 1985 or&#13;
an increase of 225 million U.S. dollars. The current account deficit is&#13;
now 5.5 percent of GDP; the ratio goes down to 1.3 percent in the bal-&#13;
anced-growth-state.    Investment declines, despite the higher borrow-&#13;
ing.  Consequently, consumption in 1985 through 1991 would be about 1.4&#13;
percent higher, although the long-run consumption would be 0.3 percent&#13;
lower than than the base path because of a lower capital stock and&#13;
higher debt service obligations. The debt stock in the terminal period&#13;
is 7.4 percent higher than in the constrained case, and the aggregate&#13;
capital stock (simple arithmetic sum of sectoral capital stocks) is 0.5&#13;
percent lower. The real exchange rate naturally appreciates relative to&#13;

the base.    This is also reflected     in the shadow price of foreign&#13;
exchange which falls by four percent.      Thus, exports grow slower and&#13;
imports faster than in the previous example.        Public finances also&#13;
deteriorate because of higher debt service payments and lower revenues&#13;
due to slower growth.     Thus, both public finances and the balance of&#13;
payments are more dependent on foreign capital inflows, while demonstra-&#13;
ting less capacity for servicing the debt.    The strategy is, according-&#13;
ly, riskier.&#13;
Possible Future Shocks and Policy Changes&#13;
113.     The base path was derived given certain assumptions about like-&#13;
ly world conditions.   But Thailand is susceptible to exogenous disturb-&#13;
ances. Domestic policies may also be changed. We examine the influence&#13;
of external and internal shocks, and domestic policy changes on borrow-&#13;
ing, investment, consumption, and the real exchange rate.     We consider&#13;
the following changes starting in 1986.&#13;
External Shocks&#13;
(1) change in world interest rates&#13;
(2) change in growth in rubber export&#13;
(3) change in world demand for Thai tradeable goods&#13;
Internal Shocks&#13;
(4) change in natural gas supply&#13;
(5) change in technical progress in the tradeable sector&#13;

Policy Changes&#13;
(6) public resource mobilization through higher income tax on&#13;
urban residents&#13;
(7)  lower tariff on competitive manufactured imports&#13;
(8)  no slow-down in investment in Eastern Seaboard Development&#13;
Interest Rate Rise&#13;
114.     In the event of a one percentage point rise in world interest&#13;
rates from 1986 onward a sharp adjustment should take place (Figure 16).&#13;
Recall that this represents about a 20 percent rise in the real interest&#13;
rate.   Net new borrowing should decline 48 percent in 1986 and the net&#13;
resource transfer would become negative earlier, in 1987.     Real capital&#13;
formation is pushed down by 6 percent because, due to the high cost of&#13;
foreign borrowing, marginal investment projects become unprofitable.&#13;
Real consumption goes down by 4 percent. The scope of adjustment can be&#13;
best appreciated by considering the material balances equation of the&#13;
manufacturing sector.&#13;
AQTR     = A(CTRrTR) +  A(cID) +    -AXTR  +  A(IMTRrTR)&#13;
14    =  (-12)       +   (-5)    +  (29)         (2)&#13;
The change in production,     AQ, is the sum of changes in the domestic&#13;
components of consumption and intermediate inputs, plus changes in ex-&#13;
ports and investment.    Adjustment takes the form of higher output and&#13;
tradeable exports, and lower consumption, triggered by an exchange rate&#13;
depreciation. The fall in investment is not so large in absolute&#13;

terms.   This is because rates of return to capital go up.    The nominal&#13;
urban wage declines relative to the GDP deflator. The tradeable sector&#13;
capital return goes up most (2 percent). The current account deficit in&#13;
1986 is 2.9 percent of GDP. The deficit would be stabilized at 0.6 per-&#13;
cent in the steady-growth-state.&#13;
115.     In this experiment, optimal adjustment is very large.   A change&#13;
in interest rate of only one percentage point necessitated a 3.1 percent&#13;
real devaluation, a 1.6 percentage point change in the current account&#13;
to GDP ratio, (down to 2.9 percent in 1986), a 12 percent nominal deval-&#13;
uation and a 1.5 percent increase in tradeable production.&#13;
116.     Slow Growth in Rubber Exports.    Assume that the nominal value&#13;
of rubber exports stays at the level of 1986 in the near future instead&#13;
of growing by 9 percent p.a. (Figure 17).     Thus, the magnitude of ini-&#13;
tial shock in 1986 is zero, i.e., the value of rubber exports does not&#13;
change from the value in the base run.      However, expectations of the&#13;
future decline in wealth forces the country into early adjustment.&#13;
117.     The current account deficit declines 0.2 percent relative to&#13;
GDP from 1986. The real exchange rate depreciates 0.4 percent. Foreign&#13;
borrowing declines by 6 percent; investment by one percent; consumption&#13;
by 0.4 percent.   A 2 percent nominal devaluation is required.    Manufac-&#13;
turing exports rise by two percent.     Two characteristics of the shock&#13;
dominate the pattern of adjustment.     Lower wealth (the terms of trade&#13;
effect) leads to lower consumption and lower borrowing.      In addition,&#13;
the shortfall of actual exports relative to initial expectations gets&#13;
larger over time, requiring successive depreciations.    This raises the&#13;

costs of borrowing and the returns to domestic saving, adding a 'price'&#13;
effect to the wealth effect.    Debt stock in the terminal period there-&#13;
fore will be seven percent lower than the base, and the capital stock is&#13;
0.4 percent below the base level steady-growth-state.&#13;
Slower Growth in World Demand for Tradeables&#13;
118.     Assume the world demand for Thai nontraditional and processed&#13;
exportables grows at 14 percent rather than the 15 percent rate assumed&#13;
in the base run (Figure 18).&#13;
119.     Despite the minor change in assumption, the response is signif-&#13;
icant.   The real exchange rate depreciates immediately by 1.3 percent.&#13;
Borrowing goes down by 18 percent or 630 million US dollars. Lower de-&#13;
mand precipitates a fall in investment.     The GDP deflator goes down by&#13;
5.5 percent; equivalently, the nominal exchange rate should decline the&#13;
same amount. The potential export revenue stream of the country is per-&#13;
manently reduced.   In order to mitigate the effects of such a negative&#13;
shock, the country tries to decrease its future indebtedness by narrow-&#13;
ing today's resource gap.       This can only be achieved by encouraging&#13;
more exports despite the associated terms of trade decline.      Thus real&#13;
tradeable exports actually increase by eight percent despite the decline&#13;
of world demand due to the price effect.     Again, the material balances&#13;
equations for manufacturing illustrates the nature of adjustment.&#13;

The economy responds in a similar manner as in the interest rate&#13;
shock:   increase exports, decrease consumption, and to a lesser extent&#13;
reduce investment.   The current account deficit falls to 4.1 percent of&#13;
GDP in 1986 and stabilizes at 1.1 percent. The net transfer is negative&#13;
from 1988. This analysis shows the extent to which a borrowing strategy&#13;
must be linked to assumptions of the growth in demand for Thai manufac-&#13;
turing goods from the rest of the world.     If these assumptions or not&#13;
borne out, or supply problems develop, a significantly more conservative&#13;
external foreign borrowing path should be adopted.        With the above&#13;
response coefficients, a 2 1/2 percentage point slower growth in world&#13;
demand for Thai goods would drive the current acount into surplus from&#13;
the outset.&#13;
120.     The strength of this result is partly a reflection of the exis-&#13;
tence of the lending constraint. Lower world demand growth reduces the&#13;
aggregate growth rate of the economy.     This lowers government revenue,&#13;
worsens the balance of payments and decreases lenders' willingness to&#13;
lend. The resource gap is, therefore, forcibly narrowed even further by&#13;
the constraint. The shadow price of foreign exchange becomes 7 percent&#13;
higher than in the base in 1986 reflecting the effects of the lending&#13;
constraint.   There is, therefore, strong pressure to increase exports&#13;
immediately to avoid balance of payments problems.&#13;
121.     Higher Expected Production of Natural Gas.   Uncertainties still&#13;
surround the volume of future natural gas extraction in Thailand. As-&#13;
sume that the value of natural gas import-substitution goes up to 2.5&#13;
billion US dollar by 1991 from i.2 billion US dollars in 1986, compared&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 107 -&#13;
with base run values of one billion US dollars in 1986 and 1.3 billion&#13;
in 1991. How would things change?&#13;
122.     Borrowing goes up -- by 500 million ITS dollars or 15 percent --&#13;
with the higher (expected) national wealth (Figure 19). The real&#13;
exchange rate appreciates by 1.3 percent immediately (1986) but gradual-&#13;
ly depreciates to the base path levels as debt service pressures&#13;
mount.    Consumption and investment both rise slightly.    There is slight&#13;
evidence of "Dutch disease"     problems.    Resources switch out of the&#13;
manufacturing sector into services.     Lower output combined with higher&#13;
domestic demand implies that exports fall significantly. Adjustment in&#13;
the manufacturing sector in 1986 is as follows:&#13;
-6        (6)   +  (2)   + (-12)  +   (-2)&#13;
AQ        AC        AI      AX          AIM&#13;
Higher Technical Progress&#13;
123.     In the base run, we kept the productivity coefficients of pro-&#13;
duction functions to be invariant over time. This is rather a pessimis-&#13;
tic assumption:    empirical evidence of positive technic4a progress in&#13;
developing countries abounds.    Here, we assume a modest technical pro-&#13;
gress of 2 percent p.a. in the tradeable sector Figure 20).       Borrowing&#13;
goes up by nine percent in 1986, because of improved debt service capa-&#13;
city.   The terminal period debt stock is about 12 percent above the&#13;
base. Investment on the other hand declines about 3 percent throughout&#13;
the simulation.   Private consumption as a result jumps up by 5 percent&#13;
in 1986, and by ten percent in 1991. The real exchange rate as expected&#13;

appreciates because of the additional supply of tradeables. The requir-&#13;
ed fall in the current account/GDP ratio is much less steep.&#13;
124.     In order to have a satisfactory economic performance Thailand&#13;
needs a steady and strong growth in its exports. In the experiment of&#13;
changing the world trade growth rate, we found that a small decline&#13;
would have serious negative effects on the economy.    This experiment on&#13;
technical progress, however, shows that small improvements would be&#13;
sufficient to offset weaker world demand than projected in the base&#13;
scenario.&#13;
Domestic Policy Changes&#13;
125.     Our choice of a base path reflects a certain element of risk&#13;
concerning lenders' willingness to lend. This willingness is a function&#13;
of the government's ability to mobilize resources from domestic sectors,&#13;
among other elements.    It can, therefore, be altered endogenously.    In&#13;
this and the next two experiments, we demonstrate that, given this form-&#13;
ulation of the lending constraint, fiscal policies changes can have a&#13;
large impact on borrowing and therefore consumption patterns.&#13;
Higher Urban Income Tax&#13;
126.     We first raise the urban income tax (Figure 21).   This actually&#13;
raises private consumption by increasing the amount that the government&#13;
(and therefore the country) can borrow from foreigners permanently.&#13;
This decreases government domestic financing needs, freeing up private&#13;
sector funds for consumption and investment. The improved fiscal posi-&#13;
tion lowers the need for investment to generate government revenue to&#13;

safeguard creditworthiness. Investment as a result is reduced and there&#13;
is a strong boost of private consumption despite the loss in disposable&#13;
income caused by higher taxes. The real exchange rate&#13;
appreciates, leading to a rise in real wages. Private sector welfare is&#13;
increased overall.&#13;
127.     Lower Tariff on Competitive Imports.    A lower tariff on compe-&#13;
titive imports, on the other hand, has opposite effects on the fiscal&#13;
position (Figure 22).   Lower tariff rates would, in the absence of the&#13;
lending constraint, reduce distortions, generating positive effects on&#13;
growth.   With the lending constraint, however, the results are quite&#13;
different. We simulate a reduction of the average tariff to ten percent&#13;
from 16 percent.     To maintain balance of payments equilibrium,      the&#13;
current account deficit is forced down to 1.1 percent of GDP (4.8 pecent&#13;
in the base); the shadow price of foreign exchange soars; tradeable&#13;
exports must increase by 50 percent; investment jumps up by eight&#13;
percent; and consumption plummets by over 20 percent.         The loss in&#13;
public revenue is 24 percent.    This sharply increases the riskiness of&#13;
public debt. Lenders cut back credit lines. Borrowing is only 18 per-&#13;
cent of what is possible without the policy change.&#13;
128.     Whether or not such immediate adjustments are possible is not&#13;
the major concern here.     The direction and magnitude of the required&#13;
changes, however, suggests that policy makers would be well advised to&#13;
phase major changes in a consistent package with other reforms.       Even&#13;
policy changes that increase efficiency in the medium- to long-run, can&#13;

have adverse effects unless the negative impact on public resource&#13;
mobilization is offset by other measures, such as higher taxes elsewhere&#13;
or lower government consumption.&#13;
129.     Eastern Seaboard Development.    Assume that government invest-&#13;
ment in real terms is increased by 5-6 billion bahts, to finance the&#13;
Eastern Seaboard Development for example (Figure 23). Assume also that&#13;
technically these projects have the same high rate of return as other&#13;
investments in Thailand, but that the government only recovers resources&#13;
from its investment via the general growth in the economy that is&#13;
stimulated.    This may represent the long gestation period that        is&#13;
usually the case with such large scale investment.        The simulation,&#13;
therefore, highlights the trade-off between long-run growth and a&#13;
balance in public finances.&#13;
130.     We find the consequences of such public investment are enorm-&#13;
ous.  Borrowing in 1986 falls by 26 percent.    The exchange rate deprec-&#13;
iates in real terms by 2.5 percent. Exports of tradeable goods jump by&#13;
13 percent to finance the decline in resource transfer from foreigners&#13;
requiring a large nominal devaluation.    Investment goes up by 2.2 per-&#13;
cent. This exceeds the increase in public investment; private&#13;
investment also goes up. Consumption declines, therefore, significantly&#13;
throughout the simulation years, and although it ends on a higher growth&#13;
path, the immediate costs outweight future benefits.      Overall welfare&#13;
falls.&#13;

Future Summary&#13;
131.     The base path derived for the medium-term (1985-92) evolution&#13;
of the Thai economy illustrates certain important characteristics of any&#13;
future foreign borrowing   strategy.    First, the high current account&#13;
deficits of the recent past cannot continue over a medium-term horizon&#13;
without jeopardizing creditworthiness. Although the deficit may reason-&#13;
ably stay as high as 5.3 percent of GDP in 1985, it must come down&#13;
quickly towards 2 percent by 1989 and thereafter.     Second, in order to&#13;
sustain the capital inflows implied in such a transition path, invest-&#13;
ment must be high and directed towards tradeable production; export&#13;
growth, especially in manufacturing, must be rapid. These would permit&#13;
rapid GDP growth at 7.5 percent per year; a high rate by present stan-&#13;
dards but one that was exceeded in the past and that is achieved in&#13;
other East Asian economies.    Even so, a continued real depreciation of&#13;
the exchange rate is necessary to promote the required structural ad-&#13;
justment of productive capacity towards foreign-exchange generating out-&#13;
put. Net foreign exchange resource transfers from international borrow-&#13;
ing must turn negative by 1989 to avoid an excessive debt build-up.&#13;
132.     A key assumption behind this result is that active government&#13;
intervention is desirable to reduce the risk of losing access to inter-&#13;
national credit lines. In the absence of such concerns, borrowing would&#13;
be higher and investment lower. Consequently, domestic savings&#13;
would also be low. We formalize this risk by introducing a lending con-&#13;
straint linked to the evolution of the balance of payments and the state&#13;

of public finances.   In the absence of domesic policy changes, govern-&#13;
ment savings can only improve if there is higher growth in the economy&#13;
(a higher tax base) or lower borrowing.     Thus, our base case has more&#13;
conservative borrowing and higher investment and domestic savings in the&#13;
long-run than under a laissez-faire strategy.&#13;
133.     We investigate how the economy would optimally respond as exog-&#13;
enous and policy parameters change. Table 12 reports the magnitudes of&#13;
optimal responses of the key variables with respect to some of the&#13;
shocks.   Two general points emerge:   the responses are quite varied in&#13;
magnitude according to the type of shock or policy change; and the of&#13;
lending constraint has strong effects on the need for and desirability&#13;
of adjustment.   For the most part, borrowing and investment move in the&#13;
same direction after a shock, although to differing degrees.       In some&#13;
cases, however, where the lending constraint is significantly affected,&#13;
they move in opposite directions.       A policy-induced   improvement in&#13;
creditworthiness permits higher borrowing and lower investment at the&#13;
same risk level, and vice-versa.&#13;

Appendix 2&#13;
Derivation of Terminal Conditions&#13;
1.       We resort to the turnpike theorem in deriving the terminal&#13;
conditions of the model.     The theorem states that an economic system&#13;
abstracted into a model obtains the highest efficiency when: 1/&#13;
(1) the system first changes its capital structure toward the&#13;
von Neumann balanced-growth proportions;&#13;
(2) when it is sufficiently close to this configuration, it&#13;
spends most of the time growing at the balanced-growth-&#13;
state maximal rate.&#13;
(3) as the end of the time horizon nears, it bends away from&#13;
the balanced-growth to satisfy the desired terminal&#13;
conditions.&#13;
In other words, the welfare of an economic system is maximized when it&#13;
quickly approaches the balanced-growth path growing at the maximum rate&#13;
and qtays on it insofar as it is possible to do so.&#13;
2.       We assume that by the time the model reaches the terminal&#13;
period, the system has already come close enough to the desired&#13;
balanced-growth path, and therefore, we force the system to be in that&#13;
state from then on. This assumption effectively gives us the terminal&#13;
conditions by specifying the necessary amounts of borrowing and&#13;
1/ See for example, Burmeister and Dobell (1970) for exposition of this&#13;
theorem. Samuelson (1960) and McKenzie (1963) prove the theorem when the&#13;
production functions are nonlinear.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 132 -&#13;
investment that support the balanced-growth path which, in turn,&#13;
satisfies the first order conditions of the dynamic problem.&#13;
3.       This assumption is attractive because it gives the important&#13;
terminal conditions within the framework of optimal growth theory.&#13;
There are, however, drawbacks. First, the system may not have obtained&#13;
enough proximity to the "turnpike" by the terminal period to warrant&#13;
such terminal conditions.     Our terminal conditions, then, assign too&#13;
high a value to the terminal capital stock and too high a cost to the&#13;
terminal debt stock, thereby biasing the results toward higher&#13;
investment  and  lower   borrowing  toward  the  end  of   the  simulation&#13;
period.   As discussed in para. 61 of the text, this divergence may be&#13;
significant close to the terminal period.&#13;
4.       Second, the growth rate derived through assumptions that all&#13;
the first order conditions are satisfied may not be compatible with the&#13;
von-Neumann balanced-growth growth rate.      We have not examined this&#13;
possibility or its implications. Future efforts are clearly needed. We&#13;
do agree, however, that the terminal conditions may be interpreted as a&#13;
reflection of the planner's preference or general expectation as to&#13;
which direction the economy is movin, rather than as a reflection of the&#13;
strict optimality conditions of infinite time horizon models.&#13;
5.       If the growth rate of all real variables is g, and labor force&#13;
grows at   n, utility per capita grows by   ((1 + g)/(1 + n))       .  The&#13;
discounted sum of per capita utility after T th period to infinity is&#13;

(6 - gpc) (1 + 6)T - 2&#13;
where&#13;
gpc      I + n&#13;
This is the second term in the objective function.&#13;
6.        Terminal period borrowing and investment are the amounts that&#13;
allow  such a   steady growth state.       The  first  order condition   for&#13;
optimization with respect to borrowing in a two sector (tradeable and&#13;
nontradeable) economy facing a real interest rate of rr is&#13;
ct+    b              p  /'P          1- a&#13;

t                     Nt + 1 Tt + I&#13;
when consumption aggregate C is the Cobb-Douglas function of sectoral&#13;
consumption (See Glick and Kharas,      1984).    With exogenous rates of&#13;
population growth and inflation, the same relationship can be rewritten&#13;
as&#13;
(1 + ir)(1 + n)b           1 + XT  1-a &#13;
t +1    (1 + n)(l + 'T) (1 + 6)    1 + TN              t&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134 -&#13;
where ir is the nominal interest rate and&#13;
Pit + 1&#13;
=i           - 1   i = T, N&#13;
Pit&#13;
Assuming a constant real exchange rate, i.e.,       7rT = wN 3 r (at, say,&#13;
the world inflation rate), g can be expressed as&#13;
1&#13;
1 + -g '(l + r)(1 + ')(1 + 6)) (1 + n)&#13;
and&#13;
1 + gpc a1 + ir                   1  b&#13;
1 +gc =Q + n)(1 + )(1 + 6) ) b&#13;
The sectoral output also grows at g with labor force in each sector&#13;
increasing at   n.   The capital stock in each sector has to grow at&#13;
(1 + n)   i)   i&#13;
for each sector, when ai is the capital income share in sector i. The&#13;
debt outstanding in real terms also grows at g.       In nominal terms, it&#13;
then grows at g + w .&#13;

            Thailand : an assessment of alternative
            foreign borrowing strategies
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper assesses alternative foreign
            borrowing strategies for Thailand using a medium-term
            dynamic optimization model. The model has five sectors:
            rubber, other agriculture, manufacturing, services, and
            construction. This model is first applied to an analysis of
            the historical strategy taken by Thailand between 1975 and
            1981. It is then solved for 1985-1992 to generate a future
            foreign borrowing strategy. The result shows that although
            Thailand may have overborrowed in the late 1970s, it can
            utilize moderate foreign borrowing beneficially, given its
            potential for strong economic performance in the next
            decade. This is, however, conditional on export performance
            as good as in the past, on raising domestic savings and on
            altering the structure of domestic output towards tradeable
            goods. An analysis of the alternative suggests that robust
            foreign borrowing strategies should be based on an
            understanding of the structure of the economy, its
            flexibility in adjusting to shocks, on expectations of
            future events, and on lenders' behavior. The endogenous
            and simultaneous nature of the interactions of key
            macrovariables cannot be overemphasized. Thus, the borrowing
            strategy must be made consistent with fiscal, monetary and
            commercial policies.
