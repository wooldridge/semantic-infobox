                                Structural Adjustment   Credit&#13;
                                  Credit Number 33231KH&#13;
              Release of the Second Tranche and Waiver of Two Conditions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        I. Summary&#13;
&#13;
1       On February 29, 2000, the Board of Executive Directors approved the Structural&#13;
Adjustment Credit (SAC) for the Kingdom of Cambodia in the amount of SDR 21.9&#13;
million (US$30 million equivalent at the time of the Credit approval) to be disbursed in&#13;
three tranches. The first tranche of SDR 7.3 million      (US$lO million  equivalent) was&#13;
disbursed on May 3, 2000.       The floating tranche of SDR 3.6 million     (US$5 million&#13;
equivalent) was released on September 11, 2001. The Kingdom of Sweden (through&#13;
SIDA) is co-financing the SAC program. The second tranche release of the SIDA grant&#13;
(US$1.6 million   equivalent) is conditional upon the completion of the actions for the&#13;
second tranche release under the SAC.&#13;
&#13;
2       This memorandum summarizes recent.economic developments and discusses the&#13;
progress made in fulfilling   the conditions for the release of the second tranche of the&#13;
SAC.    It concludes that the Borrower has maintained a satisfactory macroeconomic&#13;
policy framework, achieved satisfactory progress in carrying out the overall program with&#13;
respect to public resource management, public sector management, and enhancing&#13;
governance and fighting corruption, and completed six of the eight specific actions for&#13;
second tranche release as required under Part A of Schedule 2 of the Development Credit&#13;
Agreement.    One condition related to the Law on Investment has only been partially&#13;
completed, because after a process of extensive, additional consultation with the private&#13;
sector, the precise formulation for the revised Law submitted to the National Assembly&#13;
was changed from the language inserted into the tranche condition.      Another condition&#13;
related to the social sector disbursement ratio was also only partially met because flood-&#13;
related expenditures raised non-social       sector spending in    an unanticipated,   but&#13;
appropriate, amount. The Government is continuing to support the thrusts of these two&#13;
conditions by making the investment incentive regime more transparent and predictable,&#13;
and by further reorienting expenditures to the social sectors.&#13;
&#13;
3       In the light of satisfactory overall performance, it is proposed that waivers be&#13;
granted on a no-objection basis for the above actions in order to release the second&#13;
tranche of the Credit, in the amount of US$15 million equivalent.&#13;
&#13;
                                      II. Background&#13;
&#13;
4.      After almost three decades of armed conflict, significant progress has been made&#13;
since the formation of the Royal Government in 1993 in stabilizing the economy, in&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
restoring economic growth, and in undertaking policy reforms to transform the economy&#13;
into a market-oriented one.    Despite the progress made over the past several years,&#13;
Cambodia still remains one of the poorest countries in Asia. Its 13 million citizens have&#13;
an average per capita income of US$280, one of the lowest in the region, and poverty is&#13;
pervasive across the country, in particular in the rural areas. According to the recent&#13;
National Poverty Reduction Strategy (NPRS), 36 percent of the population is in poverty.&#13;
&#13;
5.      The SAC program has been formulated under the overarching framework of the&#13;
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FYOO-03. IDA has been closely collaborating&#13;
with the IMF which had a parallel PRGF program in place. The SAC program aimed to&#13;
help push forward the Government reform agenda, with an emphasis on institutional&#13;
underpinning, in the following three areas: (a) improving public resource management&#13;
which includes resource mobilization    and forestry management; (b) enhancing public&#13;
sector management, which comprises expenditure rationalization and preparatory steps&#13;
for  military  demobilization   and administrative  reform;   and (c) formulating    and&#13;
implementing a strategy on enhancing governance and fighting corruption in economic&#13;
management.&#13;
&#13;
6       The IDA    and IMF Boards endorsed Cambodia's Interim Poverty Reduction&#13;
Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) in January 2001 and PRSP Preparation Status Report in January&#13;
2002. The Government completed the first full PRSP, called National Poverty Reduction&#13;
Strategy (NPRS), in late December 2002. The full PRSP (25360~KH) was endorsed by&#13;
the IDA and IMF Boards in February 2003 as a credible poverty reduction strategy that&#13;
provides a sound basis for Fund and IDA concessional assistance. The CAS for 2004-&#13;
2008, based on the full PRSP, is currently under preparation.&#13;
&#13;
               III. Overall Conditions for the Second Tranche Release&#13;
&#13;
7       Pursuant to Part (d) of Section 2.02 of Article II of the Development Credit&#13;
Agreement, release of the second tranche requires compliance with overall conditions of&#13;
(i) macroeconomic framework satisfactory to IDA        and (ii) overall progress on the&#13;
program as set out in the Letter of Development Policy (LDP) satisfactory to IDA, in&#13;
addition to compliance with the specific second tranche release conditions&#13;
&#13;
                            A. Macroeconomic     Framework&#13;
&#13;
8.      Macroeconomic     developments have been satisfactory. The IMF's          Poverty&#13;
Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) program, focusing on fiscal and financial sector&#13;
reform, has been on track. The last installment of the PRGF was released in February&#13;
2003 and a new PRGF program is being considered.&#13;
&#13;
9       During the SAC implementation period (2000-2003),        the economy grew at a&#13;
robust rate of about 6 percent per annum, despite severe floods in 2000-2001, driven&#13;
mainly by strong exports of garments, and also tourism and construction. GDP grew at&#13;
7.0 percent in 2000, 5.7 percent in 2001, and 5.5 percent in 2002.       The economy is&#13;
projected to slow down in 2003 (4.8 percent growth) due to adverse effects of anti-Thai&#13;
riots in January, the regional SARS outbreak in early 2003, and uncertainties in the run-&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                                        3&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
up to the national election held in July and subsequent delay in forming                                                     a new&#13;
government.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
10             Budgetary               performance             continued to improve.       The      overall        fiscal    deficit&#13;
(excluding grants) was limited to around 6 percent of GDP during 2000-2002, while the&#13;
current surplus was maintained at around 1.0-1.5 percent of GDP. In 2003, the fiscal&#13;
deficit is projected to widen to around 7 percent of GDP in 2003 due to the revenue&#13;
shortfall associated with the slowdown of the economy as explained in para 9. Despite&#13;
shortfalls in customs revenue, government revenue was at around lo-11 percent of GDP&#13;
during 2000-2002, reflecting improved collection of domestic taxes and non-tax revenue.&#13;
Overall expenditure was contained below budget targets, thus contributing                                                    to the&#13;
avoidance of domestic financing.&#13;
&#13;
11.            Monetary policy was prudent. Due to strict budgetary discipline, inflation was&#13;
close to zero during 2000-2001, and around 4 percent in 2002, and around 3 percent in&#13;
2003. External developments were on track. While there was a marked slowdown in the&#13;
growth of garment exports since mid-2001, the external current account deficit was&#13;
contained at around 1l-13                                 percent of GDP (excluding grants). Gross international&#13;
reserves reached about 3 months of imports of goods and services. The riel continued to&#13;
be stable in U.S. dollar terms.&#13;
&#13;
12             Thus, the key components of the macroeconomic                                 policy framework               - fiscal&#13;
policy,          monetary              policy and exchange rate policy, are being implemented                                  in a&#13;
manner satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
                                        B. Progress in Carrying out Overall Program&#13;
&#13;
13              Cambodia's progress in carrying out the overall program has been satisfactory.&#13;
This is described below in respect of the broad areasthat were covered by the program:&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
forestry management, public revenue management, public sector management, and&#13;
governance diagnostics.&#13;
&#13;
14       Forestry Management.      Forestry is a central part of the Government's SAC-&#13;
supported reform program. In 1997/98, just prior to the SAC-supported program, an IDA&#13;
report estimated illegal logging at 4 million cubic meters per year, a rate of exploitation&#13;
that would have exhausted the forest in 5 years. Contributing to this was an inadequate&#13;
forest concession system, poor enforcement, and a weak and ambiguous legal and&#13;
institutional framework. The government program since then has reduced illegal logging,&#13;
although illegal logging does still persist and tensions remain within the Government on&#13;
the pace and specifics of the program. Government actions to crack down on illegal&#13;
logging, have included, for example, cancellations of concessions, seizure of logging&#13;
equipment, joint operations with the military against suspected illegal logging, and the&#13;
recruitment of an independent monitor of forest crimes reporting. The forest concession&#13;
system has been reduced in area from 6.4 million      hectares to 2.5 million hectares and&#13;
concession logging is currently under suspension as planning and reviews proceed. One&#13;
million   hectares of areas formerly under concession have been established as legally&#13;
protected forests (Cardamom Mountains, Preah Vihear and Mondulkiri)          with severely&#13;
restricted access for logging.     Drafts   of  strategic forest management plans and&#13;
environmental     and social impact assessments were disclosed for the first time in&#13;
Cambodia, and this has enabled some public oversight over the concession process.&#13;
Documents have also been released in affected districts and communes, and the&#13;
Government has begun a program of more extended consultation and discussion of its&#13;
plan review and consideration process. A draft model contract has been prepared and&#13;
will be used as the basis for finalizing    new contracts with concessionaires once the&#13;
strategic forest management plans have been approved and compartment and coupe plans&#13;
based on those strategic plans have been prepared. A new Forest law, designed to&#13;
strengthen enforcement efforts, and Sub-Decrees on Community          Forestry and Forest&#13;
Concession Management have provided an institutional and legal framework required for&#13;
sustainable forest management.&#13;
&#13;
15.      However, these achievements have taken 33 months longer than originally&#13;
anticipated under the SAC-supported program.         The first delays were occasioned by&#13;
irregularities discovered in the management of forestry revenues. These discrepancies&#13;
were discussed with the Government and in some cases mitigating measures were taken,&#13;
including tightening procedures to channel funds into the Treasury. In December 2002,&#13;
following    a clash between police and demonstrators in front of the Department of&#13;
Forestry and Wildlife,     the Government     announced its intention      to terminate its&#13;
recognition of Global Witness as independent monitor of forest crimes reporting, which&#13;
was made effective in April 2003. Continued allegations of illegal logging, corruption,&#13;
vulnerability   of forest dependent populations and mismanagement of forest resources&#13;
have persisted, and these have undermined confidence in the Government's achievements&#13;
and commitment.       In response to these setbacks, the SAC was extended to give the&#13;
Government more time to addressthe specific concerns raised about its forestry program.&#13;
On November 25, 2003, the Government signed a new contract with another outside&#13;
independent monitor, Societe Generale de Surveillance, Sp. A. under terms of reference&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
reviewed by a multi-donor      working group on natural resource management after an&#13;
international competitive bidding process. Notwithstanding the continued complexities&#13;
in reforming this sector and problems with the management of forest resources, sector&#13;
reform is moving ahead with significant implementation of the framework now in place.&#13;
As outlined above and detailed in paras 33, 36, and 39 below, IDA is satisfied with the&#13;
progress achieved in the forestry sector reform program as spelled out in specific&#13;
conditions and as described by the Government in the Letter of Development Policy. The&#13;
Government has also agreed to an extension of the Forest Concession Management and&#13;
Control Pilot project for 18 months (through end-June 2005) which will contribute to the&#13;
implementation and sustainability of the actions supported by the SAC.        A multi-donor&#13;
forestry sector review is ongoing with Bank involvement and will contribute to a stronger&#13;
dialogue between the Government and donors and to identification of a future assistance&#13;
program for the sector.&#13;
&#13;
16.     Public Revenue Management.       There has been satisfactory progress in increasing&#13;
revenue and improving efficiency of the system. Cambodia increased the share of total&#13;
revenue in GDP from 8.4 percent in 1998-99 to around 10-l 1 percent in 2000-02, mainly&#13;
due to expansion of the tax base. This was helped no doubt by the replacement of the&#13;
turnover tax with the value added tax (VAT), because the latter covered all incorporated&#13;
businesses.    The amendment. of the Law on Investment, approved in 2003, which&#13;
rationalized tax incentives, is also expected to contribute to revenue increases in future.&#13;
Overall, these policy measures raised revenue and improved the efficiency of the tax&#13;
system. Better use of pre-shipment inspection services also helped to improve collections&#13;
and speed up shipment, but problems remain with regard to informal charges at customs&#13;
and ports that shippers have to pay. However, Cambodia had less successin its efforts to&#13;
improve tax administration. The Technical Cooperation Action Program (TCAP) adopted&#13;
in 2001 contributed to some improvements, but the binding constraint lay in the&#13;
inadequate number of professional tax and customs collectors and the incentive structure&#13;
under which such personnel operated.&#13;
&#13;
17      Public Sector Management.      The Government sought to reorient public spending&#13;
and manage it more efficiently,    and there was satisfactory progress in respect of this&#13;
aspect of the Government's overall program.     There was significant improvement in the&#13;
alignment of public expenditures with the development objectives: allocations for 4 key&#13;
sectors, notably education and health, rose from 2.0 percent of GDP in 1999 to 3.6&#13;
percent of GDP in 2002 (see Table 2 in para 47). However,                problems of cash&#13;
management have delayed releases of these allocations, until late in the year, thereby&#13;
muting somewhat the full impact of these increased allocations. Given the existing&#13;
weaknesses in budgetary data systems, the Government has initiated an expenditure&#13;
tracking study to trace actual spending on health and education, from the center down to&#13;
the local level. To improve the effectiveness of such spending, initial steps have also been&#13;
taken to    improve   linkages between planning     and budget execution, through the&#13;
development of a medium-term expenditure framework, but a good deal more remains to&#13;
be done. The recent Integrated Fiduciary Assessment and Public Expenditure Review&#13;
(IFAPER) completed in September 2003 has identified a substantial unfinished agendaof&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
reforms to improve public expenditure management and effectiveness of expenditure&#13;
policy.&#13;
&#13;
18     Reductions in public spending on defense and security from around 4 percent of&#13;
GDP in 1998 to 2.8 percent in 2002, together with increases in revenue (as reported in&#13;
para 16 above) permitted the reorientation of public spending towards priority programs.&#13;
As a result of the first phase of the full scale demobilization program, the military payroll&#13;
stood at just over 112,000 in September 2002, down from 164,000 before demobilization&#13;
began. Those removed included over 15,000 ghost soldiers, more than 8,000 widows&#13;
transferred to the Ministry    of Women and Veterans, and 1,500 soldiers demobilized&#13;
under the pilot     project, and 15,000 mainly          elderly, sick,  and disabled soldiers&#13;
demobilized under the first phase of the full scale program.           The full scale program,&#13;
which is being supported by IDA through a Demobilization             and Reintegration Project,&#13;
was based on a review of the experience of a pilot project carried out in full consultation&#13;
with donors, NGOs and civil society. The pilot project and the discharge of the first&#13;
15,000 soldiers     were    completed     satisfactorily.  However,    the  second phase of&#13;
demobilization   under which a further 15,000 soldiers will          be discharged, has been&#13;
postponed pending resolution of procurement-related issues under the IDA credit, and&#13;
submission of audits. The Government has stated their commitment to resolving these&#13;
issues and continuing with demobilization in the near future. The Ministry of National&#13;
Defense with the support of Australia (AusAID) has also completed the preparation of a&#13;
white paper on long term national defense policy.&#13;
&#13;
19      Governance      Diagnostics    and    Dissemination.     In   addition  to   improving&#13;
governance in respect of forestry, public revenue management, and public                 sector&#13;
management, the program sought to prepare detailed diagnostics on governance through&#13;
surveys, and to disseminate the findings of that diagnostic and the resulting action plan.&#13;
This was done, as described in detail in section IV.       In addition, more detailed work has&#13;
been carried out in respect of how governance factors impinge on the private sector,&#13;
especially exporters and investors' decisions because of high unofficial payments and&#13;
long delays i.e., the Integrated Framework trade diagnostics completed in 2002, and the&#13;
ongoing Investment Climate Assessment that is nearing completion.           Both of these show&#13;
clearly what action needs to be taken in order to improve the climate for private investors&#13;
and the competitiveness      of Cambodian exporters, currently being undermined by&#13;
governance problems.&#13;
&#13;
20      Despite this significant progress in diagnosing the problems and disseminating the&#13;
findings as well as in developing consensus among Cambodians and other development&#13;
stakeholders on the actions needed, implementation of actions to improve governance has&#13;
been relatively slow.&#13;
&#13;
21      As described above and while recognizing that there has been slower than&#13;
expected progress on implementation of some aspects of the program, IDA is satisfied&#13;
with the overall progress on the program as set out in the LDP.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                   IV. Specific Conditions for Second Tranche Release&#13;
&#13;
22.     Pursuant to Part A of Schedule 2 of the Devel .opment Credit Agreement, release&#13;
of the second tranche requires that IDA be satisfied with the following       specific eight&#13;
conditions    in the areas of revenue mobilization,       expenditure rationalization,  and&#13;
enhancing governance and fighting corruption.&#13;
&#13;
                                 A. Revenue Mobilization&#13;
&#13;
23      There are two second tranche release conditions on revenue mobilization.        The&#13;
first condition is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
The Borrower has submitted for adoption by the National Assembly an amendment to&#13;
Article 14 of the Law on Investment, and introduced related measures, acceptable to the&#13;
Association and in form and substance consistent with paragraph 8 of the Letter, with a&#13;
view to rationalizing     the incentive regime inherent in the Law on Investment and&#13;
eliminating distortions thereunder.&#13;
&#13;
24.     According to paragraph 8 of the Letter of Development Policy, the Government&#13;
was committed to amending the Law on Investment with the following          main elements:&#13;
(a) elimination   of the special 9 percent corporate tax rate for all new investment and&#13;
phasing the 9 percent rate out to the standard 20 percent under the Law on Taxation for&#13;
the next five years for existing approved and operational projects; (b) elimination of the&#13;
tax free reinvestment of profits and introduction of an appropriate investment allowance&#13;
in the Law on Taxation at a rate to be determined, satisfactory to IDA, and applicable to&#13;
all qualifying investment, new or expansion, irrespective of source of finance, without&#13;
evaluation; (c) repeal of the current tax holiday provisions and the introduction of a three&#13;
year tax holiday, conditional on annual certification of compliance, to all qualifying new&#13;
investment, without evaluation; the use of a tax holiday will deny the tax payer any&#13;
benefits available under the Law on Taxation during the tax holiday including initial&#13;
investment allowance as well as accelerated depreciation allowance; all current tax&#13;
holidays   provided under the Law       on Investment     will be grandfathered; and (d)&#13;
elimination   of the right to the tax free repatriation of earnings and other incomes by&#13;
approved enterprises.&#13;
&#13;
25      Parts (a), (b), and (d) of this condition     have been fully met.     A waiver is&#13;
sought for part (c) of this condition, which has not been met. A bill to amend the Law&#13;
on Investment was submitted to the National Assembly, and subsequently adopted in&#13;
February 2003. The submitted bill,       and the adopted amended Law on Investment,&#13;
includes the following elements regarding the conditionality:&#13;
&#13;
(a) The new clause "A qualified investment project shall be subject to a profit tax rate&#13;
after its tax exemption period as determined in the Law on Taxation" was introduced,&#13;
replacing the previous clause "A corporate tax rate of 9% except tax rate on the&#13;
exploration and exploitation of natural resources, timber, oil, mines gold, and precious&#13;
stones which shall be set in separate laws. "&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                               8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  (b) The previous clause "In the event profits are reinvested in the country, such profits&#13;
  shall be exemptedfrom all corporate tax" was dropped.&#13;
&#13;
  (c) The new clause "A qualified investment project (QZP) shall be entitled to exemption&#13;
 from the tax on profit imposed under the Law on Taxation for a tax exemption period.&#13;
  The tax exemption period is composed of a Trigger Period + 3 years -+ n years (n shall&#13;
  be determined in the Financial     Management Law). The maximum allowable Trigger&#13;
  Period is to be first year of profit or three years after the QIP earns it first revenue,&#13;
  whichever is sooner. " was introduced, replacing the previous clause "A corporate tax&#13;
  exemption of up to 8 years depending on the characters of the project and the priority of&#13;
  the government which shall be mentioned in a Sub-Decree."&#13;
&#13;
  (d) The previous clause "Non-taxation on the distribution       of dividends or profits or&#13;
  proceeds of investments, whether transferred abroad or distributed in the country"      was&#13;
  dropped.&#13;
&#13;
  26      While the spirit of  part (c) has been met, the specific proposal in the second&#13;
  tranche condition was to apply a 3-year tax holiday without evaluation.            This was&#13;
  modified after extensive consultations with the private sector, prior to submission of the&#13;
  bill to the National Assembly.     The Government wished to have some flexibility         in&#13;
  determining the length of the tax holiday (rather than uniform 3 years) in consideration of&#13;
  strategic importance of each investment project based on pre-set explicit criteria. IDA&#13;
  concurred with it as the amended clause provides significantly enhanced transparency&#13;
  and predictability in investment incentives (the main thrust of the conditionality) and also&#13;
  as the consensus will      ensure higher compliance from       the private   sector in the&#13;
  implementation    of the Law.   The Government is continuing its efforts to make the&#13;
  investment incentive system more transparent and predicable. The Bank is supporting&#13;
  the Government's efforts with targeted technical assistancefor the preparation of the sub-&#13;
  decreefor the amended Law on Investment.&#13;
&#13;
. 27.     "The related measures" referred to changes to other legislation necessary for&#13;
  consistency and unambiguity.    The obvious effected legislation is the Law on Taxation.&#13;
  The amended Law on Taxation was adopted by the National Assembly in February 2003,&#13;
  at the same time as the adoption of the amended Law on Investment.&#13;
&#13;
  28      The second condition on resource mobilization is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
  The Borrower has re-established a system of pre-shipment inspection of imports, on&#13;
  terms and conditions acceptable to the Association, and in accordance with the policies&#13;
  and principles laid down in paragraph 1I of the Letter.&#13;
&#13;
  29      According to paragraph 11 of the Letter of Development Policy, the Government&#13;
  was committed to re-establishing the pre-shipment inspection (PSI) system with the&#13;
  following main elements: (a) extending the PSI to all imports except for a list of goods&#13;
  agreed with IDA;     (b) using pre-shipment inspections valuations for the basis of the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
import value for customs purposes; and (c) instituting a system of prepayment of customs&#13;
duties and other taxes at imports for all sealed containers based on the pre-shipment&#13;
inspection report, allowing in principle immediate clearance of such containers without&#13;
inspection on arrival, within the framework of risk management system, whose criteria&#13;
are satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
30       This condition   has been met.     PSI was reinstated in October 2000 with the&#13;
following elements regarding the conditionality:&#13;
&#13;
(a) The only exemptions are for cigarettes, shipments below a threshold of $4,000 (the&#13;
latter is normal in PSI contracts), imports for investment companies, diplomatic missions,&#13;
as well as precious metals (e.g., gold), temporary imports.&#13;
&#13;
(b) Pre-shipment inspection valuations are being used for the basis of the import values&#13;
for customs purposes. The only exceptions are for products where the Ministry             of&#13;
Economy and Finance has assigned minimum values higher than the PSI valuation for a&#13;
few products--the substance of this was to avoid under-valuation.&#13;
&#13;
(c) Duty and taxes are paid at the time of import, based on the PSI Report of Findings. A&#13;
system of prepayment is being implemented for companies with good records of law&#13;
compliance and reputation within the framework of risk management system of the&#13;
Customs and Excise Department.         In some cases, PSI agency's Reports of Findings&#13;
(ROFs) are not accurate and sealed containers do not always contain what are indicated in&#13;
the ROFs. To strengthen the PSI mechanism, a PSI Steering Committee was established&#13;
to addressconcerns, raised by importers and the service provider.&#13;
&#13;
                                 B. Forestry Management&#13;
&#13;
31       There are three second tranche release conditions on forestry management. The&#13;
first condition is asfollows:&#13;
&#13;
The Borrower      has satisfied the Association     that it has maintained     its quarterly&#13;
publication   on forestry  crime monitoring    and that such publication   has been made&#13;
regularly available to the public, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 13 of&#13;
the Letter.&#13;
&#13;
32       According   to the paragraph 13 of the Letter of Development            Policy, the&#13;
Government was committed to continuing to report quarterly on forest crimes to the&#13;
public to provide a firmer basis for further investigations and preventive actions.&#13;
&#13;
33.      This condition    has been met.     The Government established a forest crime&#13;
monitoring system composed of units in the Council of Ministers, the Department of&#13;
Forestry and Wildlife     (DFW), and the Ministry     of the Environment. Since 1999, the&#13;
Government has produced regular reports on the level, type and geographic incidence of&#13;
forest crimes including timber theft, arson, land encroachment, and other crimes. The&#13;
publication   on forestry crime monitoring      has been made regularly (on a quarterly&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
schedule) to the public through direct distribution to the press, embassies, and others.&#13;
Given these arrangements, IDA is satisfied that the specific tranche condition has been&#13;
met.&#13;
&#13;
34.     The second condition on forestry management is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
The Borrower has completed aforestry concession review and taken actions based on the&#13;
outcome of the review, in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 14 of the Letter.&#13;
&#13;
35      According to paragraph 14 of the Letter of Development Policy, the Government&#13;
was committed to carrying out a performance review of existing concession contracts and&#13;
will  take actions based on the outcome of the review, within           the framework    of&#13;
Cambodian law and the existing contracts, by: (a) terminating non-performing contracts,&#13;
where appropriate; (b) requiring other concessionaires to present restructuring programs,&#13;
satisfactory to IDA; and (c) not awarding any subsequent contracts outside the scope,&#13;
rules, and procedures set out in the Sub-Decree on forestry concession management.&#13;
&#13;
36.     This condition has been met. The Government completed a performance review&#13;
of forty concession contracts in August 2000 and based on the outcome of the review,&#13;
twenty   five  non-performing   contracts were terminated. For the remaining        fifteen&#13;
concession contracts, the Government required concessionaires to present restructuring&#13;
plans satisfactory to IDA.   However, concessionaires were slow to engage. Accordingly&#13;
in December 2001, a Prakas (regulation) of the Ministry      of Agriculture, Forestry, and&#13;
Fisheries   suspended operations in     all forest concessions pending settlement on&#13;
restructuring programs to be submitted by concessionaires. As a first step towards&#13;
restructuring, these concessionaires presented draft strategic forest management plans,&#13;
which are in the process of being revised for final review by the Government. Based on&#13;
the review of the draft strategic forest management plans, the Government has initiated&#13;
actions to terminate seven concession contracts. For the remaining eight, review process&#13;
is still underway. Cambodian Forest Law and the Sub-Decree on Forest Concession&#13;
Management require preparation of five year compartment plans and annual operating or&#13;
"coupe" plans, consultation with concerned stakeholders, and final approval by the&#13;
Government before new contracts can be issued and logging can resume. In the&#13;
meantime,    logging  and transport of logs remains under suspension in all forest&#13;
concessions, except for one stump collection contract to salvage wood from already&#13;
logged trees which was awarded in an area where the concession contract was terminated.&#13;
In addition, the on-going monitoring under the Forest Concession Management and&#13;
Control Pilot Project indicates that no subsequentforestry concessions have been granted&#13;
outside of    the terms and conditions     of the Sub-Decree on Forest         Concession&#13;
Management.&#13;
&#13;
37.     The third condition on forestry management is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
The Borrower has, following full consultation with stakeholders, and in accordance with&#13;
the provisions of paragraph 15 of the Letter, submitted for adoption by the National&#13;
Assembly a draft law revising the Forest Law, acceptable to the Association, and&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                               11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
establishing   clear  responsibility for  forest   management and administration,        and&#13;
providing for enforcement authority, inter-sectoral oversight and public accountability.&#13;
&#13;
38       According to paragraph 15 of the Letter of Development Policy, the Government&#13;
was committed to adopting a new Forest Law, in full consultation with all stakeholders,&#13;
which will clearly establish responsibility for forest management and administration,&#13;
provide for enforcement authority, intersectoral oversight, and public accountability.&#13;
&#13;
39.      This condition has been met. The drafting of a new Forestry Law was initiated&#13;
in 1994 with FAO technical assistance. After a hiatus, consultations were renewed in&#13;
2000/01 through several public workshops, and the draft was made available for public&#13;
comment.     NGOs, FAO, and other interested parties submitted comments and revisions&#13;
were made. The draft law was submitted to the National Assembly in August 2001 and&#13;
was signed into law in August 2002. The Law provides a sound legal basis for control,&#13;
allocation, and management of the national forest estate, clarifies jurisdiction over forest&#13;
areas and parks and protected areas, establishes an administrative structure for forest&#13;
management, and provides recognition of         customary property rights.    Special efforts&#13;
were made in the drafting process to ensure compatibility     with the Land Law and other&#13;
legislation. The Forestry Law is satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
&#13;
                              C. Expenditure    Rationalization&#13;
&#13;
40       There are two second tranche release conditions on expenditure rationalization.&#13;
The first condition is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
The Borrower has presented to the Association a draft FY 2001 budget, acceptable to the&#13;
Association,   including   budget allocations for, and contents of      the Priority Action&#13;
Program     (PAP)   and the Accelerated District       Development (ADD),      and showing&#13;
enhanced allocations for health, education, agriculture and rural development sectors in&#13;
terms of share of total current expenditures as compared with FY 2000 budget.&#13;
&#13;
41       This condition   has been met.    The budget plan for the 4 key sectors (health,&#13;
education, agriculture, and rural development) increased from 299 billion riels to 415&#13;
billion riels in the 2001 budget. As a share of total current spending, this is up from&#13;
24.6% of current expenditure in the 2000 outturn to 29.2% of the current expenditure in&#13;
the 2001 budget. The allocation for Chapter 13 (PAP and ADD) in the 2001 budget was&#13;
increased to 76.08 billion riels from 9.5 billion riels in 2000. As the SAC second tranche&#13;
was initially  envisaged to be released by March 2001, the program did not include&#13;
medium-term conditions beyond 2001. However, as the SAC second tranche release has&#13;
been delayed, the Government substantially has increased expenditures for the 4 key&#13;
sectors over the SAC implementation period of 2000-2003 as shown in the para 47 and&#13;
Table 2.&#13;
&#13;
42.      The second condition on expenditure rationalization is as follows:&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 The Borrower has submitted to the Association satisfactory evidence in terms of the&#13;
formula specified in paragraph 19 of the Letter of Development Policy, to show that: (a)&#13;
the ratio of actual disbursements of non-wage operating expenditures for          the health,&#13;
education, agriculture and rural development sectors combined during FY 2000 have&#13;
been not less than the corresponding ratio for    the remaining sectors combined; and (b)&#13;
actual disbursements for   the Accelerated District Development (ADD) program during&#13;
the sameperiod have been not less than the corresponding budget allocation.&#13;
&#13;
43       According to paragraph 19 of the Letter of Development Policy, the Government&#13;
was committed to the following:&#13;
&#13;
In the past, diversions of budgeted amounts away from the priority           sectors toward&#13;
defense, security, and other public activities--together with continued revenue shortfalls--&#13;
have been a major reason for low implementation in the key economic and social sectors.&#13;
In the years 2000-2002, the Royal Government will take increased measures to ensure&#13;
that the budgeted amounts in these priority sectors are in fact realized to the fullest extent&#13;
possible. Toward this end, the Royal Government will provide IDA              with evidence&#13;
 showing that the ratio of actual disbursements of non-wage operating expenditures (total&#13;
current expenditure minus chapter 10) to the combined budgetary allocations for key&#13;
 social and economic sectors (i.e., health, education, agriculture, rural development) has&#13;
been no less than the corresponding ratio for the rest of the sectors combined. In addition,&#13;
the Royal Government will provide IDA with evidence showing that actual disbursement&#13;
in riel amounts for the ADD program has been no less than the budget allocation.&#13;
&#13;
44.      This condition  has not been met, and a waiver is sought.        The thrust of this&#13;
 condition was to protect the disbursement to the key social and economic sectors as&#13;
 compared with the budget allocation at least on par with the rest of the sectors so that,&#13;
 when combined with the Board condition on enhanced 2000 budget allocation for key&#13;
 sectors, it would contribute to expenditure reorientation toward key sectors. Regarding&#13;
 the element (a) of the conditionality,   the ratio of actual disbursement to the budget&#13;
 allocation for the four key sectors combined was 83.1%, as compared with                  the&#13;
 corresponding ratio of 89.1% for the remaining sectors combined.&#13;
&#13;
 45      There were two main reasons for this: emergency post-flood rehabilitation needs&#13;
 and weak absorptive capacity. First,      Cambodia was hit by severe floods in July-&#13;
 November 2000, the worst in 70 years. Some 30 percent of rice fields were damaged,&#13;
 major parts of roads and irrigation facilities were washed away, and many schools and&#13;
 hospitals were damaged. Total damage was estimated at around $180 million (5 percent&#13;
 of GDP). As a result, the Government had to divert cash from the allocated social sector&#13;
 outlays to the emergency post-flood rehabilitation needs. A substantial part of the post-&#13;
 flood rehabilitation outlays were of a social expenditure nature and if they had been&#13;
 properly classified as the social sector outlays in the budget table, this condition could&#13;
 have been met outright.    Second, in early 2000 the Government established the Budget&#13;
 Strategy and Enforcement Center (BSEC) at the Ministry of Economy and Finance as a&#13;
 one-stop shop to streamline the screening of bids for funding, and facilitate cash&#13;
 disbursement to key social and economic sectors. The role of BSEC was to facilitate the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
operation of the new Priority Action Program (PAP) based on advance payment of&#13;
budget allocations on a quarterly basis, with post-audit replacing pre-audit.    However,&#13;
PAP started almost four months late in September 2000. This was due mainly to&#13;
communication problems regarding financial procedures, coordination failures, and some&#13;
coordination   breakdown between the BESC           and the Ministry    Health.  Provincial&#13;
department directors were very cautious and slow in using the PAP fund even when the&#13;
PAP installments had been already released from the National Treasury and deposited in&#13;
their accounts, as they were not familiar with post-audit system.&#13;
&#13;
46      In 2002, the situation improved compared with 2000, but still the disbursement&#13;
ratio for the four key sectors was 91.9% as compared with the corresponding ratio of&#13;
94.8% for the remaining sectors combined. The main reasons for this were: (i) the&#13;
Government set too ambitious social sector expenditure targets in the budget; and (ii)&#13;
weak capacity of line ministries to develop expenditure programs and to adopt associated&#13;
regulations.&#13;
&#13;
47.     Although this conditionality    was not met in terms of the specific quantitative&#13;
indicator, the thrust of the conditionality   (protection of social sectors against revenue&#13;
shortfalls, and increase in disbursements to these sectors) has been satisfied. There has&#13;
been significant    improvement     in expenditure reorientation toward key social and&#13;
economic sectors since 1999 (see Table 2). Expenditure for the four key sectors was&#13;
increased substantially as a ratio of GDP from 2.0% in 1999 to 2.3% in 2000, 2.9% in&#13;
2001, and 3.6% in 2002. In contrast, defense and security expenditure was decreasedas&#13;
a ratio of GDP from 3.9% of GDP in 1999 to 3.5% in 2000, 3.0% in 2001, and 2.8% in&#13;
2002.&#13;

&#13;
48      Regarding the element (b) of the conditionality, the actual disbursement for ADD&#13;
in `2002 was 4,691 million    riels as compared to the budget allocation of 6,000 million&#13;
riels due to the reasons explained in the paragraph. 45.       ADD program is for a cash&#13;
advance system for district health centers. The Government introduced the Priority&#13;
Action Program (PAP)--cash advance system to health and education sectors--to extend&#13;
the thrust of the ADD        to more comprehensive PAP with          a view  to enhancing&#13;
disbursement to key social sectors. Spending for PAP in 2000 was 890 million riels. The&#13;
combined ADD        and PAP actual spending for 2000 was 5,581 million           riels. The&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Government is committed to continuing expenditure reorientation toward key social&#13;
  sectors as committed in the PRSP. The Bank is continuing the policy dialogue to ensure&#13;
  adequate budget disbursement to key social sectors, including        the ADD     and PAP&#13;
  programs, among others, in the context of the recently completed Integrated Fiduciary&#13;
  Assessment and Public Expenditure Review (IFAPER).&#13;
&#13;
                    D. Enhancing Governance and Fighting Corruption&#13;
&#13;
  49.      The second tranche release condition is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
  The Borrower has,following full consultations with stakeholders, and in accordance with&#13;
  the provisions of paragraph 34 of the Letter: (a) conducted surveys on governance and&#13;
  corruption, and, on the basis thereof prepared a diagnosis and formulated a national&#13;
  action plan acceptable to the Association; (b) disseminated the findings of the surveys&#13;
* and details of the national action plan; and (c) begun implementation of the national&#13;
  action plan.&#13;
&#13;
  50.      Paragraph 34 is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
  As important    steps toward these objectives, with assistance from IDA,        the Royal&#13;
  Government carried out governance/corruption surveys involving citizens, government&#13;
  officials, and private enterprises. Based on the survey results, the Government will:   (a)&#13;
  prepare a diagnosis; (b) formulate a National Action Plan based on the results of these&#13;
  surveys and those sponsored by other donors, in close consultation with the private&#13;
  sector, NGOs, and the donor community;       (c) disseminate the findings of the surveys&#13;
  along with an action plan to the government officials, the public, and local press; and (d)&#13;
  begin implementation of the action plan.&#13;
&#13;
  51       This condition  has been met.     The Government commissioned a local NGO,&#13;
  Lidee Khmer, to carry out a diagnostic study on governance and corruption in 1999-2000.&#13;
  The surveys were conducted in November/December 1999. The study included three&#13;
  surveys of citizens, enterprises and public officials     concerning their perceptions of&#13;
  corruption problems in the public sector. The diagnostic surveys generateduseful data to&#13;
  diagnose the extent of governance and corruption problems in the public sector in&#13;
  Cambodia. Based on the analysis of the survey results, a report was prepared in May&#13;
  2000, entitled "Cambodia:       Governance and Corruption Diagnostic:      Evidence from&#13;
  Citizen, Enterprise and Public Official Surveys."      The Government prepared an initial&#13;
  draft of a Governance Action Plan (GAP) and presented it at the Consultative Group&#13;
  meeting in May 2000. The initial draft of GAP built on the analysis and findings of a&#13;
  number of studies, including       the diagnostic study mentioned above, a study on&#13;
  governance and sustainable development carried out by the Cambodia Development&#13;
  Resource Institute (CDRI) with financial support from the ADB, and many other reports&#13;
  prepared by other donors. Since then, the Government has held extensive consultations&#13;
  with many donors, NGOs, and the private sector before finalization        of the GAP and&#13;
  approval by the Council of Ministers in March 2001. The Government organized a&#13;
  National Forum in December 2001 to start disseminating the GAP and the diagnostic&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
report on governance and corruption. The forum was chaired by the Prime Minister and&#13;
was attended by ministers, senior civil servants from all over the country, and external&#13;
stakeholders, totaling some 700 participants.    It was followed by four workshops in&#13;
provinces targeting public officials (some 900 participants) and external stakeholders&#13;
(donors, NGOs, academia, and the press) in the first half of 2002. The Government has&#13;
begun implementing GAP since its official adoption in March 2001. While some actions&#13;
have already been completed, several others are in the process of being implemented.&#13;
Significant progress has been made in some areas, including           public finance, but&#13;
implementation in other areas, particularly for legal and judicial reform, has been slow.&#13;
The progress of actions in GAP was reported to the public in the Government's biannual&#13;
GAP Progress Reports in June and December 2001.            The Government is currently&#13;
preparing the second GAP with more focus on legal andjudicial reform.&#13;

            Cambodia - Structural adjustment Credit
            Project : Release of second tranche - waiver of two conditions
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This document summarizes recent,
            economic developments, and discusses the progress made in
            fulfilling the conditions for the release of the second
            tranche of the Structural Adjustment Credit (SAC) Project.
            It concludes that the Borrower has maintained a satisfactory
            macroeconomic policy framework, achieved satisfactory
            progress in carrying out the overall program with respect to
            public resource management, public sector management, and
            enhancing governance and fighting corruption, and, completed
            six of the eight specific actions for the second tranche
            release as required under the Development Credit Agreement.
            One condition related to the Law on Investment has only been
            partially completed, because after a process of extensive,
            additional consultation with the private sector, the precise
            formulation for the revised Law submitted to the National
            Assembly was changed from the language inserted into the
            tranche condition. Another condition related to the social
            sector disbursement ratio was also only partially met
            because flood-related expenditures raised non-social sector
            spending in an unanticipated, but appropriate, amount. The
            Government is continuing to support the thrusts of these two
            conditions, by making the investment incentive regime more
            transparent and predictable, and, by further reorienting
            expenditures to the social sectors. In the light of
            satisfactory overall performance, it is proposed that
            waivers be granted on a no-objection basis for the above
            actions in order to release the second tranche of the
            Credit, in the amount of US$15 million equivalent.
