and Education.                                            The educational community agrees to create a Health Committee to improve local&#13;
The model focuses on building local                       management skills so the school can take over the management of its own program&#13;
capacity so that communities will be                      after a pilot phase. The make-up of the Health Committee reflects the diverse actors&#13;
able to administer the health and                         in the educational community. Its members include the school principal, health&#13;

that end, the NGO facilitates the                         representative of the Ministry of Health. The Health Committee directs each school's&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
HOW DOES THE MODEL WORK?&#13;
&#13;
   The model follows a step-by-step methodology, consisting of six different steps in the project&#13;
   cycle.&#13;
&#13;
1. The NGO presents the model to regional and provincial health and education authorities.&#13;
   Thereafter, schools are selected by the NGO through a school district competition. Basic&#13;
   requirements for selection are that the school have an active parent-teacher association and&#13;
   that teachers are willing to take on new challenges.&#13;
&#13;
2. The model is then presented to the educational community which, in turn, sets up a Health&#13;
   Committee as the "motor" for the school's health promotion strategy. The committee is made&#13;
   up of a team representing the educational community. It also administers the autonomous&#13;
   health fund, presented at a public ceremony. This ceremony conveys prestige as well as the&#13;
   social pressure for a committee to carry out its functions properly and effectively.&#13;
&#13;
3. The Health Committee undertakes an assessment of the school's health conditions by surveying&#13;
   all students or, if the student body is very large, a sample group. One question always included&#13;
   in the survey is: What things about the school do you not like? Students may be asked to write&#13;
   or draw their answers.&#13;
&#13;
4. Based on the assessment, the Health Committee develops a work plan to be implemented by&#13;
   the educational community. Activities focus initially on improving health services and training&#13;
   teachers and student health monitors.&#13;
&#13;
   Example of activities:&#13;
   One Health Committee tackled "deplorable" hygiene services; rebuilt bathrooms and provided&#13;
   chlorinated drinking water; created modules to teach children how to use and maintain&#13;
   bathrooms, which consisted of holes in the floor and flushing with buckets of water.&#13;
&#13;
5. During the start-up phase, the NGO representative works closely with the Health Committee.&#13;
   As the committee gains confidence, the NGO reduces contact to a once-a-month three-hour&#13;
   meeting to monitor implementation of the work plan and to help resolve problems and conflicts.&#13;
   The NGO is involved in the project during the eight months of the school year.&#13;
&#13;
6. An external evaluation based on pre-established standards is done twice a year by a three-&#13;
   person team consisting of one representative each from the health and education ministries,&#13;
   and from a civil institution. As an incentive, depending on points achieved, the school is&#13;
   awarded a flag, whose color reflects the success obtained in fulfilling the objectives implicit in&#13;
   the competition to be a "health- promoting school". The flag is the visible symbol of each&#13;
   school community's progress towards tackling its own health issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Significance of the flag colors in the evaluation:&#13;
&#13;
Green with gold: Excellence. Optimum results. School is capable&#13;
of working completely autonomously.&#13;
Green: Success. Good results and considerable capacity for&#13;
autonomy.&#13;
Blue: Correct. Acceptable results. Insufficient autonomy&#13;
Red: Deficient. Scant results. Great dependency.&#13;
Black: Failure. Work plan unfulfilled and no results.&#13;
&#13;
Of the 152 schools which have participated in the program, 43%&#13;
have received a green with gold flag, 41% a green flag and 16%&#13;
a blue flag for the year 2000.&#13;

From the single-school pilot in 1990, the program has expanded&#13;
to 152 urban and rural schools involving 70.000 students                      Ministry of Education&#13;

includes both the Health and Education Ministries and several&#13;
other NGOs. By 2003, the goal is to have the program operating&#13;
in all public schools throughout the country.                                 Unit for District Educational Service&#13;

Evolution of the model:&#13;
1990:       Kallpa initiates the project "botiquines escolares" (school&#13;
            medicine cabinets), in one school in a shantytown south of        Regional &amp; Sector Directorates&#13;
            Lima.                                                             for Health and Education&#13;
1991:       Cholera epidemic in Peru requires mass dissemination of&#13;
            basic hygiene and health practices. Kallpa works against               Coordinate actions with Kallpa.&#13;
&#13;
            the epidemic through schools with "botiquines escolares" and&#13;
            education material.&#13;
1990-96: The project "botiquines escolares" expands to other                  NGO Kallpa&#13;
            departments, Cusco, Ayacucho, Lima and Iquitos. Design                Promotes a strategy for Primary Health Services for&#13;
            of school curricula and course for teaching health in teacher          school children with participation of the educational&#13;
            training institutes.                                                   community: teachers, parents, health coordinators&#13;
1997:       The project "botiquines escolares" is evaluated and                    and students.&#13;
            recommended. The project "Health-Promoting Schools" is                Provides the schools with a health fund to finance&#13;
            established and executed as a pilot project in three schools           Health Committees' actions.&#13;
            in the southern part of Lima.                                         Provides training.&#13;
&#13;
1998-00: The program model is consolidated. Strategy adapted for                  Awards prizes to the School.&#13;
&#13;
            mass implementation. Health Committee emphasized.&#13;
            Kallpa becomes process facilitator. External evaluation&#13;
            begins. Network of Health-promoting schools established,          Municipalities&#13;
            led by principal in school that pioneered program.&#13;
2003:       Goal: to establish the program in all public schools                   Recognize the work performed by KALLPA in a district by&#13;
            nationwide.                                                            supporting its actions and providing follow up.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The NGO's own role changed during the decade from implementing&#13;
the project itself to that of promoter and process facilitator. By lowering&#13;
its profile, the NGO encouraged the local community to assume                 Ministry of Health and Ministry of Education&#13;
responsibility for the program.                                                    Providelocal Basic Health and Education Services.&#13;
                                                                                   Evaluate the program.&#13;
 Health Coordinator position, initially filled by an NGO professional,&#13;
    was assumed by a trained teacher.&#13;
 Emphasis for implementation shifted from the Health Coordinator&#13;
    to the school's Health Committee in order to broaden the                  NGOs&#13;
    responsibility for the program.                                                The NGO Pro Vida provides the medicines for the school&#13;
 NGO reduced its leadership in the program in favor of giving the                  medicine chest.&#13;
    school community a greater say in how it was run. Adopted facilitator&#13;
    role.&#13;
 School rituals and symbols incorporated into strategy to mesh the&#13;
    program into the educational community: flags, parades, posters,          Health Committee and School Principals&#13;
    public recognition (ceremonies, lapel pennants, etc).                          The School is committed to participating in the project and&#13;
                                                                                   to supporting data collection.&#13;

                                      RESULTS&#13;
&#13;
                                         A NEW MODEL EVOLVED from the pilot, with a defined strategy, proven&#13;
                                             methodology and low-cost educational materials to accompany each step of&#13;
                                             the program implementation.&#13;
                                         HEALTH COMPONENT IN SCHOOL CURRICULUM: the health component has&#13;
                                             been incorporated to the school curriculum and today, there are established&#13;
                                             mechanisms for transmitting its contents and teacher's training.&#13;
                                         IMPROVED COORDINATION: the NGO and the education and health authorities&#13;
                                             at regional and local levels actively coordinate their activities to create favora-&#13;
                                             ble conditions for sustainable hygiene and health education in schools.&#13;
                                         LOCAL MANAGEMENT CAPACITY STRENGTHENED through the work of Health&#13;
                                             Committees and their administration of the autonomous health fund.&#13;
                                         CHANGE OF HABITS: the model based on a multidisciplinary intervention and&#13;
                                             active participation by the educational community generated rapid changes&#13;
                                             and improvements in hygiene habits.&#13;
                                         AUTONOMOUS HEALTH FUND allows for quick, tangible improvements in school's&#13;
                                             health and sanitation conditions, thereby reinforcing the health promotion process.&#13;
                                             Initial successes lead the committee to search for additional funding (mostly&#13;
                                             given in kind), which is an essential step to achieving self-sufficiency.&#13;
                                         INCREASED TEAMWORK: participatory approach generates attitudes of teamwork&#13;
                                             and tolerance that carry over into the classroom, to the benefit of the students.&#13;
                                         IMPROVED SELF- ESTEEM: service personnel, technically trained to maintain healthy&#13;
                                             conditions, gain self-esteem and become key players in keeping schools clean.&#13;
                                         SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY: student health monitors learn social responsibility and&#13;
                                             develop leadership qualities.&#13;
                                         BETTER ORGANIZATION: a more fluid relationship develops between parents&#13;
                                             and school authorities and the school and its community. This is the basis for&#13;
                                             future organizational efforts to benefit the local community.&#13;
                                         RECOGNITION: use of rituals and symbols as important incentives to the school&#13;
                                             community: flags, parades, posters, public recognition (ceremonies, lapel&#13;
                                             pennants, etc.).&#13;
                                         INDEPENDENT SCHOOLS: 40% of all the schools that have participated in the&#13;
                                             program, are managing their own health and hygiene activities today.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
RISKS&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Competition between schools may translate into pressure on teachers&#13;
and stifle their creative endeavors.&#13;
Student health monitors may tend towards "controlist" attitudes,&#13;
particularly in urban schools.&#13;
Some Health Committees may have difficulty in diversifying their&#13;
strategies to obtain additional funding for the program.&#13;

            Promoting health and hygiene through the
            school system in Peru
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Many countries suffer from high levels
            of water and sanitation-related diseases that affect the
            poorer segments of society, and children in particular. To
            break the transmission routes of these diseases increased
            access to water and sanitation must be combined with
            improved hygiene practices. Experience has shown that an
            effective method to improve hygiene is by teaching basic
            health and hygiene in schools, since children are important
            agents of change. This field note describes the experiences
            from a model for health and hygiene promotion through the
            school system in Peru.
