            Private power financing - from project
            finance to corporate finance
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Project financing of independent power
            producers (IPPs) may seem the only solution to the
            intractable problem of getting private credit to the power
            sector. In the developing world, however, the public-private
            partnership in project-financed IPP ventures has been slow
            to produce results. To achieve substantive progress in IPP
            financing, limited recourse project financing will have to
            evolve toward structures with greater balance sheet support.
            First, balance sheet support by the main partners in an IPP
            financing offers greater security to lenders and provides
            easier access to long-term debt. Second, balance sheet
            support by IPP sponsors can open access to public equity
            markets, which are deeper and generally cheaper. Third,
            increased corporate balance sheet support is a corollary to
            the restructuring in the world s power sectors. Greater
            corporate finance support will make it possible to raise
            private capital for independent power financing from wider,
            deeper, and cheaper sources. This Note recommends the
            following strategies: 1) Encourage the formation of large,
            well-capitalized independent generation companies. 2)
            Encourage divestiture of commercially operating generation
            plants by incumbent utilities to IPP developers. 3) In IPP
            prequalification under competitive bidding, give greater
            weighting to IPP developers with business listed on a stock
            exchange and to those with well-capitalized balance sheets.
            4) Encourage project sponsors to use balance sheet support
            for the financing plan in order to increase corporate financing.
