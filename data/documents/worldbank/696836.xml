LOAN AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:              Societatea Nationala a Cailor Ferate Romane&#13;
(Romanian National Railways - SNCFR)&#13;
Guarantor:             Romania&#13;
Loan Amount:           US$120 million equivalent&#13;
Terms:                 20 years, including 5 years grace at the standard variable interest rate&#13;
Project Objectives    The objective of the project is to support and deepen the restructuring&#13;
and Description:       process which SNCFR and the Government have initiated. The project&#13;
supports a set of policy measures that will be embodied in the new Railway&#13;
Law, a Restructuring Action Plan (RAP), and a Performance Contract&#13;
between SNCFR and the Government.&#13;
The project will only finance investments,which would be required even&#13;
under pessimistic traffic assumptions and would be in line with the&#13;
restructuring objectives. These include: (a) track renewal and maintenance&#13;
including mechanization on priority routes; (b) integrated railway&#13;
information system (IRIS); (c) signalling and telecommunications; (d)&#13;
environmental improvement; (e) traction and depot improvement; (f)&#13;
rehabilitation of passenger coaches and freight wagons; and (g) technical&#13;
services.&#13;
Benefits and Risks:   Because of inadequate maintenance and renewal over the last few years, the&#13;
quality and efficiency of transport services have deteriorated and operating&#13;
maintenance costs have increased. Thus, the benefits of the project will&#13;
be cost savings and improved safety and quality of services. Moreover, the&#13;
better balance between costs and revenues, which would result from&#13;
implementation of the RAP and the project, is expected to reduce the fiscal&#13;
burden of SNCFR on the Government's budget. One of the main risk&#13;
affecting the financial situation of SNCFR is of policy slippage due to&#13;
changes in the political environment. Further deterioration of economic&#13;
conditions in Romania would also pose a risk of lack of counterpart funds&#13;
and reduced rail traffic. These risks have been minimized by replying&#13;
upon conservative assumptions of railway traffic projections. However,&#13;
since they are outside control of the Bank and SNCFR, it is proposed to&#13;
hold a mid-term review to assess progress in achieving the development&#13;
objectives of the project and to assess the need for further policy measures&#13;
and/or restructure it as necessary. The physical components of the project&#13;
do not pose significant risks since all investments are for rehabilitation of&#13;
the core components of the system, which would have high priority under&#13;
any restructuring scenario.&#13;

STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. The Transport System&#13;
1.1       Romania is one of thie largest of the former centrally planned economies in the Central&#13;
and East European (CEE) Region with a land area of 237,000 s. km and a population of 23 million,&#13;
second only to Poland. Per capita income in 1994 was estimated at about US$1,100. The country&#13;
has a wide range of natural resources, including a fertile agricultural base, deposits of coal, lignite,&#13;
oil, natural gas and other minerals. Long a major food producer, Romania was a large exporter of&#13;
agricultural products until the early eighties.&#13;
1.2       The transport system has relied primarily on the railways, which have a well developed&#13;
network of 11,000 km, of which 36% is electrified and 26% is double track (para. 2.3). The road&#13;
network totals 73,000 km, of which 20% are national roads carrying 60% of the road traffic. Road&#13;
density, with regard to both population and land area, is the lowest among all CEE countries. The&#13;
Danube offers a navigable distance of 1,075 knm in Romania and the Danube-Black Sea Canal (68 km)&#13;
was opened to traffic in 1984. Ninety percent of foreign trade is handled through the port of&#13;
Constanza on the Black sea. There are five major river ports on the Danube, the largest of which is&#13;
Galati, accessible to ocean-going vessels up to 15,000 tons. There are 17 airports of which 4 are&#13;
international.&#13;
B. Traffic&#13;
1.3       Traffic on all modes has been adversely affected by the massive downturn in the&#13;
economy, compounded by the restructuring of the economy away from heavy industry which was&#13;
traditionally a large user of transport. Since 1990, GDP declined by nearly 30%, industrial output&#13;
declined by nearly 52%, exports fell by nearly 55%, real wages declined by about 30%, investment&#13;
by nearly 60%, and unemployment reached 10% of the labor force by end-1994 from near zero in&#13;
1989. The share of industry in GDP declined to 40% from 54% in 1989, and that of agriculture has&#13;
risen to about 24% from 14% in the 1980s, while trading activities have almost doubled since 1989.&#13;
1.4       As in other centrally planned economies, Romania's transport sector has been heavily rail&#13;
oriented. In 1960, rail accounted for over 80% of freight traffic and over 70% of passenger traffic&#13;
(Tables 1 and 2). While the rail share has gone down since then, in 1989, rail still accounted for&#13;
almost 70% of freight and over 40% of passenger traffic. The high share of rail freight was the&#13;
result of regulation forcing all transport above 50 km to the railways. This regulation has now been&#13;
abolished. Rail freight reached 300 million tons and 80 billion ton-km in the late 80s, but has fallen&#13;
dramatically since then. In 1994, it was down to less than a third of its 1989 level at 25 billion ton-&#13;
km. Passenger traffic held off better, going down to 45% of its earlier level.&#13;
1.5       Road traffic grew rapidly in the 70s but stagnated in the 80s as it was suppressed by&#13;
physical control and regulation. Car traffic increased dramatically in 1990, but fell back thereafter as&#13;
fuel prices were adjusted to reflect world market prices. Truck traffic has been less buoyant due to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
the downturn in the economy, but has been affected less than rail traffic. Road freight is now 50%&#13;
less than in 1989. There is virtually no intercity bus service at this time and railways remain the&#13;
essential long distance passenger carrier.&#13;
1.6       Traffic through Constanza port was around 60 million tons p.a. in the late 80s, but is also&#13;
down by two thirds since then. Of the earlier traffic, about 60% was liquid bulk and another 30%&#13;
dry bulk, leaving only about 5 million tons of general cargo. Container traffic was small but has&#13;
increased rapidly since 1989 as Romania's markets are diversifying. Inland water traffic is&#13;
insignificant at less than 4% of total land traffic. On the Danube-Black Sea Canal, traffic reached&#13;
12.5 million tons in 1989, well below the forecasts of 75 million tons made in 1979 before&#13;
construction. Traffic in 1990 had fallen to some 6 million tons. Maritime traffic carried by the&#13;
Romanian fleet quadrupled in the 70s from 4 to 16 million tons p.a. and more than doubled again to&#13;
36 million tons in 1989. It has since fallen to only 7 million tons.&#13;
C. Investments&#13;
1.7       Investments in the transport sector have been around 10% of total investments,&#13;
substantially below the level in market economies. Until the late 70s, railways got the bulk of the&#13;
investments in the sector. Later, the balance shifted toward water transport (maritime, river and&#13;
canals) with the construction of the new Constanza port, the Danube-Black Sea Canal and the&#13;
Bucharest-Danube Canal (now abandoned) and a major increase in the maritime fleet. In the 80s,&#13;
total water transport investments absorbed well over 50% of total transport investments, while rail&#13;
received about 27%. By comparison, investments in road infrastructure decreased from 9% in the&#13;
late 70s to less than 5% in the 80s (Table 3). In the 80s, construction started on the Bucharest metro&#13;
and, between 1986 and 1990, this absorbed about twice the amounts invested in the entire road&#13;
infrastructure of Romania. In recent years, investments in the sector have come to a virtual halt.&#13;
For instance, in 1992, investment for the whole sector was US$35 million, only allowing for urgent&#13;
capital repairs and periodic maintenance and no new investments. In 1993 and 1994, the level of&#13;
investment increased to around US$70 million.&#13;
D. Institutions&#13;
1.8       In 1990 and 1991, major changes took place in the transport institutions. The former&#13;
Ministry of Transport and Public Works was split into two separate Ministries. The Ministry of&#13;
Transport (MOT) was reorganized to concentrate on policy making and regulation functions rather&#13;
then being an operator of transport means. The railways, highways and ports became autonomous&#13;
units or "Regie Autonome" (RA), while road transport departments, construction departments and&#13;
design or research institutes became respectively transport companies, contractor and consultant&#13;
commercial companies (CC). The shares of these CC are still owned 100% by the state, but with the&#13;
intention of privatization as and when feasible. The MOT was reorganized again in September 1994&#13;
to place even greater emphasis on its policy making and regulatory function, while further limiting its&#13;
interference in the running of transport operations, and its staff was reduced further from 450 to 350&#13;
(Chart 1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
E. Sectoral Issues&#13;
1.9       One of the main difficulties when assessing the justification of new investments in the&#13;
sector is to evaluate the future volume and pattern of transport demand. The shift to a market&#13;
economy is resulting in less emphasis on transport intensive industries such as steel, cement and&#13;
petrochemicals and more on higher value added light industry such as textiles and agro-industry. The&#13;
latter will require lower transport volumes and are more likely to use road transport than rail or water&#13;
transport. Romania's use of energy was also very intensive. The demand for lignite and coal&#13;
transport may decline as the electric power company, RENEL, switches from domestic lignite which&#13;
is currently transported by the railway to imported coal. As energy subsidies are phased out, and&#13;
industries conserve fuel to reduce operating costs, further reductions in coal transport can be&#13;
expected. Railways are unlikely to recoup most of the lost traffic and will have to concentrate on&#13;
developing new markets such as international freight and combined transport. On the passenger side,&#13;
the need to increase tariffs in order to reduce subsidies could moderate travel demand somewhat.&#13;
1.10      Investments in the transport sector were skewed toward very large projects without regard&#13;
for economic and financial feasibility. The result is that funds for maintenance, rehabilitation,&#13;
replacement of life-expired equipment and modernization were scarce. Existing infrastructure and&#13;
equipment are obsolete and service availability is low. The Bank together with EBRD is introducing&#13;
the use of economic feasibility studies as a basis for improving decision making on investments.&#13;
1.11      The sector was no exception to the general distortions resulting from administrative rather&#13;
than market prices. Fuel prices are still controlled, but Government policy is to ensure that they&#13;
reflect fluctuations in world markets. Under the Structural Adjustment Loan (SAL) agreement has&#13;
been reached that Government would adjust them periodically to reflect external price and exchange&#13;
rate movements. Road transport prices are free for freight, but still regulated for public passenger&#13;
transport. Similarly, railways have flexibility in setting freight tariffs, but full control remains on&#13;
passenger tariffs.&#13;
F. Sector Strategy&#13;
1.12      The following principles and policies are guiding the future action of Government in the&#13;
transport sector:&#13;
(a)    Equality of treatment between private transport enterprises and state owned transport&#13;
means;&#13;
(b)    Financial autonomy of transport companies;&#13;
(c)    Freedom of action by transport companies, in terms of entry, routes, cargoes, tariffs&#13;
and investments;&#13;
(d)    Free modal choice by transport users; and&#13;
(e)    Investment decisions based on economic analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
Regarding investments in the sector, the strategy of the Ministry of Transport is as follows:&#13;
(a)    Short term: to arrest the technical and operational deterioration of the system;&#13;
(b)    Medium term: to renovate the existing transport capacity taking into account&#13;
changing demand patterns as a result of free competition between modes; and&#13;
(c)    Longer term: to modernize and develop the infrastructure, equipment and vehicles to&#13;
match the economic and technical levels of Western Europe.&#13;
This strategy is sound and is reflected in this project on the investment side as well as by the&#13;
agreements reached regarding reforms to be introduced in the sector.&#13;
G. Previous Bank Experience in the Sector&#13;
1.13          The Bank financed three projects in the transport sector: the Danube-Black Sea Canal&#13;
Project (Loan 1794-RO) of US$100 million of January 1980; the Land Transport Project (Loan 2034-&#13;
RO) of US$125 million approved in April 1981; and the Transport Project (Loan 3593-RO) in April&#13;
1993. In January 1987, OED issued the PPAR for the first project. The main conclusion was that,&#13;
although completion was 17 months behind schedule, the work was generally good. However traffic&#13;
did not materialize to the extent expected and therefore the financial results and economic benefits&#13;
were lower than estimated. A main issue raised in the report concerns the role of the Bank. The&#13;
Bank loan came five years after construction of the canal had started and mainly supplied finance&#13;
(about 5% of total cost). It would have been better to participate earlier in the project cycle to have&#13;
an impact on technical and economic decisions before they were made.&#13;
1.14        The second project was completed and the loan closed on schedule in May 1987. The&#13;
Project Completion Report (PCR) was issued in January 1992. The overall assessment was&#13;
satisfactory. Disbursements were faster than expected and the project cost was well below estimates.&#13;
Economic returns were lower than expected following the downturn in the economy since 1990, but&#13;
all components remain justified. Issues of past irregular procurement practices were highlighted by&#13;
the Government in its commentary on the project.&#13;
1.15        The ongoing Transport Project, co-financed with European Bank for Reconstruction and&#13;
Development (EBRD) and European Investment Bank (EIB), was prepared rapidly and the&#13;
cooperation throughout the project's preparation was outstanding, with the Bank's comments on&#13;
project design, concept and implementation fully taken into account. Progress on project execution so&#13;
far is good and disbursements are ahead of schedule.&#13;
H. Role of the Bank and Lending Strategy&#13;
1.16        The Bank's Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Romania, discussed by the Board of&#13;
Directors on April 5, 1994, during the presentation of the Romania Petroleum Sector Rehabilitation&#13;
Project (Loan 3723-RO), aims at supporting the Government's structural adjustment program and&#13;
macroeconomic stabilization objectives. It also identifies rehabilitation of infrastructure as one of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
priority areas for Bank lending. The Bank began the process of assisting the reform of the transport&#13;
sector through technical assistance for studies in the road, rail, ports and urban transport sub-sectors.&#13;
The road user charges study, the railway restructuring study and the urban transport study were&#13;
financed under the Technical Assistance and Critical Imports (TACI) Project (Loan 3363-RO) and&#13;
were completed satisfactorily. A port master plan study for Constanza was financed by the&#13;
Netherlands and completed in 1993 and European Union Assistance Program for Eastern Europe (EU-&#13;
PHARE) is financing technical assistance to the sector and financial audits. These studies laid the&#13;
foundation for our assistance to the sector. Real institutional reform will require continuous technical&#13;
assistance over the long term, leveraged by investment lending. The Bank's first loan in the sector&#13;
since lending resumed focused mainly on highway rehabilitation and maintenance. It also includes&#13;
technical assistance and training in the road and rail sub-sectors as well as a small railways component&#13;
for well justified and urgently needed equipment, so basic that it would be needed in any restructuring&#13;
scenario. The railway restructuring study was completed in early 1994 and the Government requested&#13;
the Bank and EBRD to assist with the restructuring process formulated on the basis of the study&#13;
recommendations. The proposed project is consistent with the objectives of the CAS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

II. THE RAILWAY SUB-SECTOR&#13;
A. Organization. Management and Staff&#13;
2.1         Societatea Nationala a Cailor Ferate Romane (Romanian National Railways - SNCFR)&#13;
was established according to Resolution No. 235/1991 of March 29, 1991 and amended thereafter. It&#13;
is an independent legal entity ("Regie Autonome" defined according to Law No. 15 dated August 7,&#13;
1990), which gives the company the right to decentralize economic activities and accelerate the&#13;
transition to a market oriented economy. SNCFR is divided into eight regions. Each region has 3 to&#13;
5 sub-regional units to manage railway operation activities. The Board is appointed by the Minister&#13;
of Transport and consists of representatives of the Ministries of Transport, Finance, Industry, Labor,&#13;
the President of SNCFR and experts. The President of the Board is assisted by four Vice-Presidents&#13;
(strategy, operational, personnel and financial). This Board is responsible for determining railway&#13;
policy, including tariff policy, organization and operations control. SNCFR has implemented the first&#13;
stage of its re-organization under the ongoing restructuring process. The organization will be along&#13;
business sector lines. When the final stage is reached in 1996, there will be five sectors as follows:&#13;
(i) infrastructure; (ii) freight; (iii) passengers; (iv) traction and rolling stock; and (v) asset&#13;
management. The relationship between these business sectors will be established on a contractual&#13;
basis. As a first step, there will be a sixth sector regrouping all present operational activities. The&#13;
plan also includes consolidation of regions.&#13;
2.2         Between 1990 and the end of 1994, the total number of staff was reduced by 65,500&#13;
(30%) (Table 4). At the beginning of 1995, SNCFR employed about 156,000 persons, of which&#13;
about 66% work in transport activities and about 29% in infrastructure. During the period 1995-&#13;
1998, SNCFR, with the Government's support, plans to reduce its staff by about 41,000 or about&#13;
26%. Some 23,500 staff were dismissed during 1994. Because staff cuts to date have not matched&#13;
the loss of traffic, staff productivity (measured in traffic units per employee) decreased significantly&#13;
since 1989. However, it has been increasing gradually since 1993 and still compares favorably with&#13;
that of many other railways at about 276,000 traffic units per year per employee in 1994. The&#13;
proposed staff reduction program included in the Restructuring Action Plan (RAP) whould be&#13;
complemented by an extensive training program coupled with a system of performance reward that&#13;
the project will support. The RAP is presented in Annex 1.&#13;
B.   Railway Facilities&#13;
Network&#13;
2.3         SNCFR's network is extensive (11,380 route kms of which 10,893 standard gauge, 427&#13;
km narrow and 60 km broad gauge) (IBRD Map No. 26473). About 2,970 km or 26% are double&#13;
track and 3,866 km, or 34%, electrified (25 kV and 50 Hz system). The total length of the track is&#13;
22,000 km of which about 14,570 km or 66% are in open lines and 7,430 km are in stations. Track&#13;
is generally in poor condition and traffic density is high on the main network (about 30 million gross&#13;
tons per line-km on the most heavily-used 4,500 km or about 40% of the network).&#13;
2.4         During the last years, maintenance expenditures were drastically reduced and about 35%&#13;
of SNCFR's network did not receive the required maintenance, causing speed restrictions on about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
5,600 km of lines. Major repairs are required on some 10,800 bridges, 38 tunnels and 480 km of&#13;
substructure works. To stop further track deterioration and to partially reduce the track overhaul&#13;
backlog of about 2,750 km, SNCFR needs to carry out annually at least: (i) 600 km of track&#13;
overhaul (400 km with new material and 200 km with used material); and (ii) capital repairs of 270&#13;
bridges and 14 tunnels.&#13;
2.5         Essential track maintenance has fallen behind because of ineffective working methods&#13;
and inadequate track maintenance machinery combined with the lack of funds. Many existing track&#13;
machines (tamping and ballast cleaning) date back to 1964; and about 70% are over ten years old.&#13;
Their technology is antiquated, their productivity is low and their availability is less than 50%,&#13;
because of a shortage of imported spare parts.&#13;
2.6         Therefore, track maintenance and procurement of track maintenance machines, together&#13;
with updated technology, introduction of elastic fastening system, production of modern concrete&#13;
sleepers and switches are essential. It is also necessary for safety reasons in train operation. In&#13;
addition, major organizational changes and concentration of responsibilities, together with staff&#13;
training, are needed. The major focus of the project is on track maintenance.&#13;
Marshalling Yards&#13;
2.7         SNCFR had 27 marshalling yards. Due to significant traffic decrease (paras. 2.13 to&#13;
2.15), their rate of utilization fell drastically. In 1994, SNCFR reclassified its marshalling yards&#13;
and, at present, only 9 yards remain in operation. The other yards are now used as freight stations&#13;
only or as storage for unused and defective wagons. Further detailed analysis is needed to determine&#13;
to what extent use of the remaining yards could be further optimized. The critical element is not their&#13;
number but their optimal operation including organization and management.&#13;
Signalling. Telecommunications and Electrification&#13;
2.8         Although about 4,700 km of the open lines are equipped with an automatic line block-&#13;
signalling system, some 650 stations with electro-dynamic interlocking equipment, and most&#13;
marshalling yards were mechanized; much of these equipments are worn out. As their maintenance&#13;
costs are high and the technology obsolete (dating back to the 1930s), they need to be replaced on&#13;
heavily trafficked routes to improve service and safety.&#13;
2.9         The telecommunications system on main lines is generally obsolete (some&#13;
telecommunications exchanges date back to the 1940s) with a huge backlog in overhauling and a lack&#13;
of spare parts. The suspended cable network (about 4,800 km) and inter-urban cable network (about&#13;
6,500 km) are very old and need urgent repairs. The electrification system, consisting of 10,900 km&#13;
of contact line and 76 electric traction substations (ETS), is also in need of urgent rehabilitation and&#13;
replacement, due to significant failures in power supply and in overhead contact lines (OCL). This&#13;
second largest component of the project addresses the most urgent needs in these areas.&#13;
Motive Power and Rolling Stock&#13;
2.10        The proportion of traffic hauled by electric traction rose from 64% in 1986 to 71% in&#13;
1994. SNCFR operates 1,060 electric, 1,200 diesel-electric and 650 diesel-hydraulic locomotives on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
the standard gauge network, of which about 20%, 75% and 85%, respectively, are over 20 years old.&#13;
Availability of electric and diesel locomotives in 1994 was about 75%. All 139 units in the rail-cars&#13;
and Electric Multiple Units (EMU) fleet have exceeded their scrapping age. The total passenger fleet&#13;
consists of about 6,680 units with a capacity of about 460,000 seats. Almost 45% are over 20 years&#13;
old. In 1994 SNCFR had about 141,000 freight wagons with a total capacity of 6.4 million tons and&#13;
an average availability of 60%. Some 60% of the fleet is over 20 years old.&#13;
2.11        The technical parameters of the traction fleet remain behind in terms of speed and other&#13;
performance criteria compared to Western European railways. In aggregate terms, fleet capacity for&#13;
traction and rolling stock exceeds actual and expected traffic demand, but the fleet does not meet&#13;
qualitative and structural requirements and should be progressively modernized, at a pace consistent&#13;
with financial constraints. However, given the surplus capacity, SNCFR needs to avoid unnecessary&#13;
maintenance through the scrapping of surplus capacity. Reducing the fleet is part of the RAP (Annex&#13;
1).&#13;
Workshops and Depots&#13;
2.12        The manufacturing industry (locomotives, wagons, coaches, track machines) was&#13;
separated from the railways in 1992 and transformed into commercial companies. Their work for&#13;
SNCFR and other parties is purely on the basis of contracts. The facilities which remain with&#13;
SNCFR to maintain and repair traction and rolling stock consist of 21 workshops, 32 locomotives&#13;
and 90 rolling stock depots. Most of them are heavily over-staffed. The workload of these&#13;
workshops will decline as the fleets of locomotives and rolling stock are reduced as indicated above.&#13;
Rationalization of fleet types and spare parts inventory, combined with the introduction of&#13;
maintenance practices based on component exchange rather than overhauls in workshops, will bring&#13;
great economy and improved efficiency. The number of workshops and depots will be reduced&#13;
significantly over the next five years as the operations are streamlined and scrapping plans progress.&#13;
A plan for reducing the number of workshops and depots is included in the RAP (Annex 1).&#13;
C.   Traffic&#13;
2.13        The major political changes in CEE countries have been accompanied by massive&#13;
economic and industrial upheavals which have profoundly affected railway traffic. With the collapse&#13;
of the Council of Mutual Assistance (CMEA or COMECON), trading relationships and traffic&#13;
movements between and within member countries have been undergoing vast changes in volume and&#13;
patterns. Economic and industrial structures are changing; markets are altering or disappearing; old&#13;
products and demand patterns for raw materials are declining; the dominance of railways, created by&#13;
centrally planned command economies, is declining and demand for railway services is being eroded&#13;
by emerging competition from road transport. The quality and level of railway services have&#13;
deteriorated due to continued reliance on traditional operating methods, low productivity, increasing&#13;
costs and inability to invest in modern working system, technology and management techniques. The&#13;
requirements of the customer have not been met because the railways lack a commercial orientation&#13;
and the concept of marketing is barely recognized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
Freight Traffic&#13;
2.14        Between 1989 and 1994, freight traffic fell about 70% in terms of tkm (from 81 billion&#13;
to 25 billion) and 68% in terms of tonnage (from 306 million tons to 99 million). The average length&#13;
of haul decreased from 265 km to 250 km. About 80% of the freight traffic is domestic, and has&#13;
been affected by the level and structure of the economy and to a lesser extent by road competition.&#13;
Three quarters of the tonnage is made up by six commodities: coal, petroleum products, chemicals,&#13;
metallurgy products, ores and building materials (Table 6). Quarry products, ballast and&#13;
construction materials, which accounted for 30% of the traffic in 1989 (85 million tons), now make&#13;
up only 15% (15 million tons), reflecting the drastic reduction in construction activities in the&#13;
country. International trade plays a relatively significant part in SNCFR's operations with exports&#13;
accounting for about 9% of the traffic, imports about 11 % and transit about 1%.&#13;
Passenger Traffic&#13;
2.15        Passenger traffic did not decrease as much as freight traffic; it went down by about 48%&#13;
from 35.5 billion passenger-km in 1989 to 18.3 billion in 1994 (Table 5). This reveals that traffic&#13;
decreased in direct relation with the decrease in the real income of the population. It is estimated that&#13;
15-20% of passengers travel without tickets and that the traffic is actually higher than reported.&#13;
SNCFR is in the process to carry out counts in trains to verify this point.&#13;
Future Traffic&#13;
2.16        In the present economic and political circumstances, both domestic and external, the&#13;
uncertainties surrounding forecasts must be emphasized. Railway freight traffic may continue to hold&#13;
up its new present level, provided SNCFR adopts an active market-based approach catering to&#13;
identified customer needs. The restructuring process may well hold the key to success or failure&#13;
here. Certain specialized international operations, such as trans-shipment through Constanza to Black&#13;
Sea destinations and inter-modal operations with Western Europe shipping could, and probably will,&#13;
assume importance in the future.&#13;
2.17        Passenger traffic is particularly difficult to forecast at this time, but can be expected to&#13;
decline in the longer term because of the growing car ownership and particularly the potential&#13;
competition of private buses which will be offering competitive services. The rate of decrease in&#13;
passenger traffic will depend on general economic conditions (affecting consumer expenditure and car&#13;
ownership), the outcome of the SNCFR restructuring process, fares policy and the approach adopted&#13;
to public service contracts.&#13;
2.18        Taking into account recent trends in rail traffic volumes and the above-mentioned&#13;
factors, it appears prudent to base the project on figures which do not assume any traffic growth from&#13;
the 1994 base. Forecasts are summarized below and detailed in Tables 5 and 6. A mid-term review&#13;
is proposed under the project (para 3.18) and, at that time, the forecast will be revised to take into&#13;
account recent developments. This may result in some changes in investment priorities which would&#13;
be taken into account under the project by reallocations between components. Two scenarios have&#13;
been retained for planning purposes; the "realistic" forecast below has been used to estimate the need&#13;
for traction and rolling stock and to develop the scrapping program, while a "pessimistic" scenario,&#13;
with a further fall in both freight and passenger traffics, has been used for the financial forecasts.&#13;

D. Operations&#13;
2.19            In recent years, SNCFR's operational performance declined due to the sharp decrease&#13;
in traffic. The utilization of rolling stock (passenger and freight services) and the availability and&#13;
utilization of electric and diesel locomotives all went down since 1989 (Table 4). SNCFR needs to&#13;
avoid unnecessary maintenance of surplus traction and rolling stock. The availability rate will be&#13;
lifted by first scrapping surplus wagons and then assessing whether maintenance efforts on the&#13;
remaining fleet need to be intensified. Targets for utilization and availability have been agreed with&#13;
SNCFR as part of the RAP.&#13;
2.20            Freight train operations have been reduced to reflect the fall of traffic. Many&#13;
operations remain of the traditional "wagon load" working between a large number of terminals. Out&#13;
of the 1,110 freight trains being run daily, over 50%  are of this traditional type. Unit trains (290)&#13;
account for 26% and direct trains another 20%. To further reduce costs, freight operations would&#13;
have to be further rationalized by increasing the proportion of unit and direct trains and cancelling&#13;
some of the local pick up and delivery trains. Frequent locomotive changes should be discontinued&#13;
and the distance between stops for technical inspections increased.&#13;
2.21            Passenger traffic is more diffuse and widely spread than freight but there is a large&#13;
number of stations with low volumes. Passenger train-km have not decreased in line with the fall in&#13;
passenger demand. The RAP includes a substantial restructuring of passenger operations, including&#13;
the closure of about half of the stations and reduction of train-km, combined with improved quality of&#13;
service. As a first step, poorly occupied and costly long distance low speed passenger trains will be&#13;
eliminated in the new timetable. After further analyses of the passenger market, services will be&#13;
segregated into two categories: intercity and suburban/regional services. The recent introduction of a&#13;
better quality, faster express train between Bucharest and Timisoara, at twice the regular fare, has&#13;
been very successful and will be replicated on other lines.&#13;

Basic Principles&#13;
2.22          The Government and SNCFR recognize the need to adapt the railway to the new&#13;
economic situation of the country. With Bank assistance (TACI Project, Loan 3563-RO), a study on&#13;
the Restructuring of the Romanian State Railways was completed in January 1994 and the&#13;
Government has requested the Bank's assistance to implement the recommendations of the study. The&#13;
Government subscribes to the general principles of the European Union (EU) Directive on Railways,&#13;
which establishes that the railways should operate independently, in a commercial manner, according&#13;
to market principles and that all social tariffs and/or unprofitable services imposed on the railways by&#13;
the Government should be covered by public service obligation contracts between the Government and&#13;
the railways. The state will also assume partial responsibility for infrastructure as it does for roads.&#13;
The above principles have been embodied in a draft Railway Law, which has been submitted to&#13;
Parliament.&#13;
Measures Already Implemented&#13;
2.23          Substantial progress has been made on developing operation and action plans for&#13;
restructuring. Achievements to date include:&#13;
(a)    the establishment, in early 1994, of an interministerial working group for the&#13;
restructuring of the railways including representatives of the Council for&#13;
Coordination, Strategy and Economic Reform, and the Ministries of Transport,&#13;
Finance, Industry, Labor and Justice;&#13;
(b)    submission of a draft Railway Law to Parliament and signature of a Performance&#13;
Contract between the Government and SNCFR;&#13;
(c)    first step of reorganization, including the creation of an infrastructure sector,&#13;
regrouping all activities in this area and introduction of separate accounting for&#13;
infrastructure activities;&#13;
(d)    staff reduction of about 23,500 persons in 1994, exceeding the targets of 20,000 set&#13;
for the year; and&#13;
(e)    marshalling yards have been reduced from 27 to 16 in 1992 and further to 9 in 1994.&#13;
Maintenance depots and other traction operating points have been reduced from a total&#13;
of 134 to 98. Surveys and counts are being carried out on passenger trains to&#13;
establish a basis for a revised timetable.&#13;
Restructuring Action Plan (RAP)&#13;
2.24          Operational plans were developed for the various activities of the railways such as&#13;
track maintenance and rehabilitation; signalling and telecommunications; traction and rolling stock&#13;
needs and performances, including assets scrapping and disposal; maintenance of traction and rolling&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
stock; integrated railway information system; and human resources including staff reduction and&#13;
training. These operational plans served as a basis for developing a six-year RAP (Annex 1).&#13;
2.25          The RAP sets objectives for all aspects of SNCFR's activity and organization, actions&#13;
needed to reach these objectives, responsibilities to carry out these actions and their timing and,&#13;
finally, the operational and financial targets to be reached as a result of the actions specified in the&#13;
plan. Some of the main targets are: (a) a further staff reduction of about 40,000 from the level&#13;
reached at the end of 1994; (b) massive scrapping of locomotives (34% of the electric locomotives&#13;
and 50% of the diesel fleet) and rolling stock (16% of the coaches and 43% of the freight cars); (c)&#13;
improvement in utilization of traction and rolling stock; and (d) financial targets (working ratio and&#13;
debt service coverage ratio). The RAP also deals with: (i) environment; (ii) the closing of workshops&#13;
and other servicing points for traction and rolling stock; (iii) the change in status of lines and stations;&#13;
and (iv) the modernization of financial management and accounting system. The RAP forms the basis&#13;
for negotiating a multi-annual Performance Contract between SNCFR and the Government. The&#13;
Performance Contract, to be updated annually, will govern respective SNCFR and the Government&#13;
responsibilities and specify operational and financial objectives, staff reductions, public services&#13;
support. capital contribution for infrastructure and investment plan. At negotiations, the RAP was&#13;
confirmed (para. 6. l(a)) and it was agreed that the Performance Contract will be updated annually in&#13;
consultation with the Bank (para 6.1 (b)).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
3.1           The objective of the project is to support and deepen the restructuring process which&#13;
SNCFR and the Government have initiated. The project supports a set of policy measures that are&#13;
embodied in the new Railway Law, the RAP, and the Performance Contract between SNCFR and the&#13;
Government as described in paras. 2.22-2.25.&#13;
B. Description&#13;
3.2           The project will only finance investments, which would be required even under&#13;
pessimistic traffic assumptions and would be in line with the restructuring objectives. They are:&#13;
(a)    Track Renewal and Maintenance on Priority Routes (41 % of project cost)&#13;
Given SNCFR's difficult financial situation, resulting in backlog of required overhaul,&#13;
track conditions have deteriorated over the last five years. As a result, train speeds&#13;
have been reduced (speed restrictions affect some 5,600 track km, about half of the&#13;
length of main lines), safety is becoming a concern and operating and maintenance&#13;
costs are increasing. Unless progress is made soon, track condition will become an&#13;
increasingly serious impediment to all other efforts SNCFR is making to recover its&#13;
financial and commercial position. The project includes: renewal of over 900 km of&#13;
priority lines over a period of five years, together with introduction of new&#13;
technology, improved sleepers and fastening and re-equipment of the rail welding&#13;
workshops (financed from local funds) and replacement of track maintenance&#13;
machines together with a catenary tensioning machine financed by the Bank;&#13;
(b)    Integrated Railway Information System (IRIS) (9% of project cost)&#13;
SNCFR computers are mostly obsolete with little residual value and of little utility due&#13;
to their insufficient capacities, lack of terminal equipment in operating units and lack&#13;
of communication circuits in working condition available to the computers. The&#13;
existing application systems support only a limited set of SNCFR's operation or&#13;
administrative functions. The project includes an integrated information and network&#13;
technology in a contemporary architecture and consisting of: (i) central and regional&#13;
computers; (ii) interfaces to the upgraded telecommunications network; (iii) user&#13;
equipment (mostly personal computers); (iv) system, data base, program development&#13;
and application software; (v) expert support and training during introductory stage;&#13;
and (vi) spares and initial supplies. The freight and passenger information system&#13;
would cover the entire network and organization of SNCFR in on-line operation. In&#13;
addition, software will be introduced for track maintenance. A modern financial&#13;
information system with a business orientation will support SNCFR's reorganized&#13;
financial and accounting functions. The Bank will finance all hardware and software,&#13;
including application software related freight and passenger information system, the&#13;
track maintenance system and the financial information system. Included in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
Bank's share of financing would also be the required front-end processors to the&#13;
upgraded data network and the training of SNCFR staff to take over and operate the&#13;
new application systems and computers;&#13;
(c)    Telecommunications (12%) and SiLnalling (10%) (22% of project cost)&#13;
Most existing facilities are technically obsolete and below modern safety standards.&#13;
Furthermore, the diverse types of equipment complicates maintenance. The project&#13;
would start solving these problems by:&#13;
(i) modernization of the telecommunication network to support the IRIS; and&#13;
(ii) replacement of worn-out equipment on critical network nodes.&#13;
The Bank will finance the cable (about 1800 km) and digital transmission equipment&#13;
for the optical fiber backbone network. Signalling, including replacement of&#13;
equipment at interlocking stations, will be financed by EU-Phare.&#13;
(d)    Environmental Improvement (0.5% of project cost)&#13;
To improve the environment at priority sites, SNCFR will procure equipment&#13;
including measurement and controlling instruments, installations for evacuation of&#13;
residuals and gas filters for oil remaining in depots. This component will be financed&#13;
by the Bank;&#13;
(e)    Traction and Depots Improvements (10% of project cost)&#13;
The project includes: (i) major overhaul of locomotives; and (ii) equipment and tools&#13;
at selected maintenance depots located at the main nodes of the network. These&#13;
would remain in use after the ongoing rationalization process and would be expected&#13;
to take the extra work from depots being closed. The overhaul of 20 electric&#13;
locomotives: 7 diesel-electric and 8 diesel hydraulic locomotives together with two&#13;
wheel tyre lathes; replacement of existing equipment; and control and testing devices&#13;
will be financed by EBRD;&#13;
(f)    Rehabilitation of Passenger Coaches and Freight Wagons (16% of project cost)&#13;
This is necessary for SNCFR to retain its customers in intercity services and special&#13;
freight and to be able to raise tariffs, reflecting improvements in quality of services.&#13;
Under this component, which will be financed by EBRD, 160 coaches and 900&#13;
wagons will be refurbished;&#13;
(h)    Technical Services (1 % of project cost)&#13;
To ensure that the objectives of the project are attained, complementary training and&#13;
equipment will be needed in particular for: SNCFR restructuring process, marketing,&#13;
finance and accounting, human resources, change management skills and technical and&#13;
operation. Assistance under the proposed project provides for about 202 staff-months&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
at SNCFR for high, middle management and specialist training estimated to cost about&#13;
$2.3 million in total (Annex 4, Table 1) to be financed by the Bank and PHARE.&#13;
C. Cost Estimates&#13;
3.3          The total project cost (including contingencies, taxes and duties) is estimated to be&#13;
about US$383 million equivalent with a foreign exchange component of US$262 million or 68% of&#13;
the total project cost. Cost estimates were prepared by the SNCFR departments on the basis of&#13;
quantity estimates from substantially completed engineering, and using unit prices from similar&#13;
projects under implementation in other countries. A detailed analysis of costs has been made to&#13;
determine the foreign exchange component and local costs. All project costs have been estimated in&#13;
US$ on the basis of mid-1995 prices at the exchange rate of 2,000 Lei per I US$. The import duties&#13;
(15%) and VAT of 18% of total costs have been calculated and added to the local component. About&#13;
40% of the local cost consists of taxes and duties. Physical contingencies (from 5% to 10%) have&#13;
been included to cover possible increases in quantities and price contingencies have been applied to&#13;
base costs following the Bank's present forecast of international inflation (it is expected that the&#13;
exchange rate will adjust to the evolution of domestic prices and of external inflation).&#13;

D. Financing Plan&#13;
3.5          The foreign costs of the project would be financed by the proposed Bank Loan ($120&#13;
million), EBRD ($72.6 million) and PHARE ($69.6 million). The EBRD financing package may&#13;
include suppliers' credit or other co-financing, including from European Union (EU) sources. Local&#13;
costs are to be funded by SNCFR. The proposed EBRD Loan and PHARE grant are being processed&#13;
in parallel to this operation and are critical to the financial viability of the project. Hence, a condition&#13;
of Loan effectiveness is that all conditions for the effectiveness of the EBRD loan (other than that&#13;
related to the effectiveness of the Bank Loan) have been met (para. 6.2(b)). The only effectiveness&#13;
condition of EBRD is that the Bank's effectiveness conditions have been met.&#13;
E. Implementation and Monitoring&#13;
3.6          The proposed Bank Loan for US$120.0 million equivalent would be made to SNCFR.&#13;
The project would be implemented by SNCFR, which would assume direct obligation towards the&#13;
Bank on the matters under its jurisdiction. A project management team (PMT) has been established.&#13;
Its members include a Chairman and higher level officials in managerial positions, at least one for&#13;
each project component, and a procurement specialist familiar with the Bank's procurement&#13;
procedures and requirements.&#13;
3.7          PMT will review and follow-up on procurement procedures and bidding documents,&#13;
monitor and coordinate every aspect of the project implementation and assemble, in quarterly reports,&#13;
all project implementation information using the methodology adopted during negotiations. PMT will&#13;
prepare detailed work schedules, with phasing, critical activities and responsibilities and coordinate&#13;
project activities. PMT will also be responsible for liaising with and coordinating all the cofinanciers'&#13;
project tasks and keeping direct contact with their missions. During negotiations, it was reconfirmed&#13;
that PMT will remain in operation and be satisfactorily staffed throughout the project execution (para.&#13;
6.1 (d)).&#13;
3.8          The project is scheduled to be completed by June 30, 2001. The project's&#13;
implementation schedule is shown in Annex 4, Table 5. The proposed Loan would close on&#13;
December 31, 2001, six months after the project Completion Date of June 30, 2001. Proposed&#13;
monitoring indicators, including selected targets in the RAP, were agreed with SNCFR and progress&#13;
will be covered in quarterly reports prepared by PMT. During negotiations, agreement was reached&#13;
on the project implementation schedule, monitoring criteria, and reporting arrangements (para. 6.1(e)&#13;
and Annex 4).&#13;
F. Procurement&#13;
3.9          Procurement arrangements for the Bank financed project elements, their estimated&#13;
costs and proposed methods of procurement are summarized in the Table below and in the Project&#13;
Implementation Plan, Annex 4, Tables 2 to 5. Procurement for all Bank-financed items would be&#13;
made in accordance with the Bank's procurement guidelines, including the Bank approved Standard&#13;
Bidding Document for Goods for Romania. Consulting services would also be procured in&#13;
accordance with the Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank borrowers.&#13;

US$2.0 million (Annex 4, Table 4), which would encourage supplier interest. There will be a&#13;
prequalification of bidders for the modernization of the telecommunication network estimated to cost&#13;
US$36.6 million and for the IRIS to cost US$26.5 million. These two items will be procured in&#13;
seven packages. There will be no Bank-financed civil works contracts in the project. All contracts&#13;
estimated to cost the equivalent of US$300,000 or above for materials and equipment would be&#13;
procured under ICB. Goods manufactured in Romania will be granted a preference of 15 % or related&#13;
duties, whichever is less, provided that the value added in Romania is more than 20% of the ex-&#13;
factory bid price of such goods. The environmental equipment, instruments and materials (US$1.2&#13;
million) would be procured (for contracts estimated to cost less than US$300,000) through&#13;
International Shopping based on the comparison of price quotations obtained from at least three&#13;
suppliers from two eligible countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.11   Consultants' services. Consultants' services envisaged in the project and financed by the&#13;
Bank would be focused on the SNCFR restructuring process and particularly the restructuring of the&#13;
financial system including assistance with project implementation and training. Total costs of&#13;
technical assistance services and training estimated at US$0.7 million will be procured in five&#13;
packages in accordance with Bank Guidelines. A detailed description of the consultancy services is&#13;
given in the Project Implementation Plan in Annex 4, Table 1.&#13;
3.12   Country Procurement Assessment. A Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR) for&#13;
Romania is under preparation. Laws and regulations regarding local procurement procedures and&#13;
practices in Romania are being reviewed in the Bank in order to reach judgement as to whether local&#13;
procedures are acceptable for Bank financed contracts. During negotiations, it was agreed that the&#13;
Borrower would use the 1995 Bank Procurement Guidelines for all procurement under the project.&#13;
3.13   All contracts estimated to cost the equivalent of US$300,000 or more (over 99% of total&#13;
project cost) would be subject to prior review and approval by the Bank. Other contracts will be&#13;
reviewed ex-post by supervision missions. All procurement will be done in 23 packages, of which&#13;
most exceed US$1.0 million (Table 4, Annex 4). Procurement information will be included in the&#13;
quarterly project progress reports agreed with the Borrower. The Borrower will also promptly inform&#13;
the Bank regarding procurement plans, solicitations, proposed contract awards and progress in the&#13;
implementation of their procurement activities. The PMT will be responsible for the procurement&#13;
processing and will have a procurement specialist familiar with the Bank's procedures. SNCFR staff&#13;
have gained familiarity with the Bank's procurement procedures, through implementation of the&#13;
Railway component of the ongoing Transport Project (Loan 3593-RO). During negotiations.&#13;
agreement was reached with SNCFR on all procurement arrangements, including the list of equipment&#13;
and materials and the procurement timetable (para. 6.1(f) and Annex 4).&#13;
G. Disbursements&#13;
3.14        The proposed Bank Loan would be disbursed against the project components as follows:&#13;
Amount&#13;
Category           (US$ Million)   % of Expenditures&#13;
1. Goods                  113.0        100% of foreign, 100% of local (ex-&#13;
(materials,                        factory cost) and 80% of local&#13;
equipment and                      expenditures for other items procured&#13;
software)                          locally.&#13;
2. Consultants'              0.7       100% of expenditures.&#13;
Services&#13;
3. Unallocated               6.3&#13;
TOTAL                 120.0&#13;
3.15       Withdrawal applications for contracts above US$300,000 would be fully documented&#13;
and for contracts valued at US$300,000 equivalent or less would be made on the basis of statements&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
of expenditures (SOE). Documentation to support expenditure financed under SOE would be&#13;
maintained by the Borrower in one location and made available upon request, for review by Bank&#13;
representatives in addition to being audited by auditors acceptable to the Bank. During negotiations,&#13;
agreement was reached on the foregoing arrangements (para. 6.1(y)).&#13;
3.16        An estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Table 10. To maintain an adequate&#13;
flow of funds for eligible project expenditures with a minimum of administrative delay, the Borrower&#13;
will establish a special account with an authorized allocation of US$7 million at a bank of its choice&#13;
that is acceptable to the Bank. The initial deposit will be limited to US$2 million, and the additional&#13;
remaining portion of the allocation will be disbursed when total disbursements have reached US$10&#13;
million equivalent. Applications for replenishment of the special account would be submitted on a&#13;
quarterly basis or when one-third of the amount deposited has been withdrawn, whichever occurs&#13;
earlier. Documentation requirements for replenishment applications would follow the same procedure&#13;
as described in para 3.13. In addition, monthly bank statements of the special account which have&#13;
been reconciled by the Borrower would accompany all replenishment applications. Records of the&#13;
special account proceeds and outlays would be available for review by the Bank's supervision&#13;
missions and subject to annual audit. The foregoing arrangements were confirmed during negotiations&#13;
(para. 6.1(h)).&#13;
3.17        SNCFR will establish and maintain project related accounts. Such accounts shall be&#13;
maintained in accordance with recognized accounting principles and practices satisfactory to the Bank.&#13;
SNCFR will also provide quarterly reports and annual financial statements to reflect the financial&#13;
performance and the position of SNCFR and of the project. An independent auditor's opinion and&#13;
report satisfactory to the Bank on the annual financial statements, should be provided within six&#13;
months of the close of each fiscal year. The foregoing project accounting, financial reporting, and&#13;
auditing arrangements should provide adequate and timely information to the Bank for supervision of&#13;
the project. These arrangements were agreed during negotiations (para. 6.1(i)).&#13;
H. Proiect Supervision&#13;
3.18        A Project Implementation Plan (PIP) has been prepared jointly with SNCFR to ensure a&#13;
shared understanding of the activities to be carried out and their timing (Annex 4). At negotiations.&#13;
SNCFR confirmed its commitment to carry out said plan in a timely manner and to review it and&#13;
adiust it as necessary during the proposed mid-term review (para. 6. 1(j)). In addition to direct&#13;
monitoring and assistance on day to day matters, which will be provided from the Resident Mission in&#13;
Romania, three two-week Bank supervision missions per year during the first two to three years of&#13;
project implementation would be needed to supervise all project activities. Thereafter, this could be&#13;
reduced to two missions per year. The missions would be staffed by a railway engineer, a financial&#13;
analyst and an economist, responsible for all engineering, financial and economic aspects of the&#13;
project. To supervise the IRIS component of the project, an information technology expert should&#13;
visit Romania about once a year and assist with review of the bidding process at headquarters. A&#13;
project launch mission will take place soon after Board presentation, to assist with preparation of&#13;
procurement documentation and help resolve any pending issues. A mid-term review will be&#13;
conducted in 1998; its scope was agreed at negotiations on the basis of the outline provided in Annex&#13;
4 (para. 6. 1(j)). In sum, proposed project supervision from headquarters would require about 20&#13;
staff weeks from FY96 to FY2001.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

I. Environment&#13;
3.19        The project has been classified as "B" for purpose of O.D. 4.01 on Environmental&#13;
Assessment, meaning that only a limited environment review is required. A preliminary&#13;
environmental review was carried out during project preparation to identify benefits, examine&#13;
potential negative impacts and propose mitigation measures where needed (Annex 3). The appraisal&#13;
team concluded that the type of rehabilitation and maintenance envisaged for the project would have&#13;
relatively minor effects largely limited to the area of the railroad itself. Railway rehabilitation would&#13;
improve the competitiveness of the railway versus its main competitor, automobile transport, and&#13;
would bring overall environmental benefits. No resettlement issues have been identified.&#13;
3.20        The proposed railway restructuring would eliminate inefficient activities, and reduce the&#13;
number of lines and stations in operation. The environmental consequences of lines/stations closures&#13;
(e.g. polluted loading and unloading areas, abandoned underground and above ground storage tanks&#13;
used for hazardous chemicals, transformers and other facilities, waste disposal areas) should be&#13;
subject to environmental auditing. A draft Environmental Law, currently in Parliament, is expected&#13;
to impose auditing requirements to restructuring operations. Until this Law is approved, restructuring&#13;
activities with expected environmental impacts should be reviewed by authorized joint teams of the&#13;
Regional Environmental Branches and the railways or by representatives of the Ministry of Waters,&#13;
Forest and Environment, depending on the scale of any operation.&#13;
3.21        Normal concerns for railways such as disposal of waste (including oil), cleaning of tank&#13;
settlements, water treatment, use of chemicals for track maintenance, and transport of hazardous&#13;
materials are covered by the national environmental legislation and regulations, and mitigation&#13;
measures are in place in SNCFR's practice. Since 1991, SNCFR has been taking steps to improve&#13;
environmental protection management. Environmental expert positions were created in the central&#13;
administration and in the regions. A total of 400 SNCFR's staff are currently employed in&#13;
environmental protection activities, including car hygiene and landscape maintenance. However, there&#13;
are still problems exist, resulting from past neglect, current financial difficulties and weak&#13;
enforcement of environmental standards and regulations. Among those are: (i) rapidly deteriorating&#13;
equipment in hygiene stations; (ii) shortage of chemicals for car cleaning and track maintenance; (iii)&#13;
outdated waste water treatment facilities in some depots and maintenance stations; (iv) insufficient&#13;
distribution of safety instructions and procedures for operations involving hazard to human health; and&#13;
(v) operational staff negligence to environmental protection requirements.&#13;
3.22        During negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Government and SNCFR that&#13;
they will take the following steps to improve the environmental conditions of rail operations as&#13;
included in the RAP (para 6. 1(k)).&#13;
(i)  Environment Management Capacity Building. The environmental specialist position in&#13;
the central administration would be clearly defined in detailed Terms of Reference;&#13;
training would be provided; and proper documentation and communications among the&#13;
departments established; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
(ii)  Setting Environmental Priorities. An environmental performance review for SNCFR&#13;
would be prepared and decision made for targeted use of funds according to the&#13;
identified priorities on the basis of environmental, economic, and financial&#13;
considerations.&#13;
The project includes financing of environmental equipment to address priority areas for&#13;
environmental improvement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
IV. FINANCE&#13;
A. Background&#13;
4.1           The Financial Organization of SNCFR matches the current organizational structure,&#13;
with each of the nine regions preparing separate financial accounts, which are then consolidated at the&#13;
Headquarters. In the past, the focus of the Finance Department in the Headquarters has been on&#13;
consolidation of information, control of funds and preparation of financial reports. Cash is collected at&#13;
the local level and then transferred via local bank accounts to the Headquarters. In turn, the&#13;
Headquarters transfers funds to the regions to cover outstanding liabilities and payroll. The highly&#13;
centralized cash system results in delays, lack of flexibility and autonomy at the regional level. The&#13;
lack of financial authority also results in the absence of accountability at the local level.&#13;
4.2           The new Railway Law, recently submitted to Parliament, will allow SNCFR to&#13;
operate as a commercial enterprise with financial autonomy, accountable for performance levels&#13;
agreed to in a Performance Contract signed by the Government and SNCFR. The Law will give&#13;
SNCFR greater freedom in setting its tariffs. In particular, the Law would allow SNCFR to negotiate&#13;
with its customers appropriate freight tariffs based on market conditions. Regarding passenger tariffs,&#13;
consultation with the Government would still be required. However, if adequate increases to cover&#13;
costs are not granted, the Government would have to compensate SNCFR for the revenue shortfall it&#13;
imposes on the railway. The Law also states that the Government will contribute to the cost of&#13;
infrastructure and SNCFR will be charged a rail user fee which would be in line with the general&#13;
principles of the EU Directive on Railways.&#13;
4.3           The RAP includes the reorganization of SNCFR into five autonomous business&#13;
sectors. The financial organization and accounting systems will be revised to match the new&#13;
organization. As a first step, SNCFR plans to separate infrastructure and operation costs. The&#13;
reorganization of SNCFR into business and profit centers will allow better financial management.&#13;
4.4           Accounting. SNCFR's accounting policies are in line with legal requirements in&#13;
Romania. The features of the accounting system can be summarized as follows:&#13;
-    standardized across all R6gies Autonomes and throughout SNCFR;&#13;
-    principally manual based resulting in difficulties in carrying out meaningful&#13;
financial analysis;&#13;
-    revenues and costs are not split according to services;&#13;
-    capital overhauls booked as direct operating costs; and&#13;
-    inadequate revaluation of fixed assets to reflect inflation results in under&#13;
calculation of depreciation expense which is based on Government directives&#13;
rather than on accepted accounting criteria. At the same time, the value of&#13;
assets are overstated to the extent that they include significant amount of assets&#13;
that are obsolete and only have scrap value.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
4.5           The lack of a good cost accounting system makes it difficult for SNCFR to apportion&#13;
costs across different activities. A study, carried out under Phase IV of the Railway Restructuring&#13;
Contract (financed under the TACI project - Loan 3363-RO) with DE-Consult (Germany), provides&#13;
the basis for separation of operation and infrastructure accounts. It also establishes the methodology&#13;
of cost allocation for various activities matching the proposed new organizational structure. SNCFR&#13;
plans to introduce a computerized costing and financial management system. This new system will be&#13;
linked to IRIS to be financed under this project.&#13;
4.6           Audit. Until 1995, SNCFR had no external audit of its financial statements and&#13;
internal audits largely focused on random checks in locations where cash was collected. Under its&#13;
obligations for Loan 3593-RO, SNCFR has engaged external auditors to carry out an audit of its&#13;
accounts for 1994. External audits by independent auditors will continue to be carried out through&#13;
the course of this project. At negotiations, it was confirmed that audits of financial statements&#13;
including project related accounts, the special account. SOEs and compliance against Loan covenants&#13;
will be carried out by independent external auditors and that the audit reports should be available to&#13;
SNCFR management and sent to the Bank within six months of the close of each fiscal year. (para&#13;
6.1 (c))&#13;
B. Recent Financial Performance&#13;
4.7           Financial Results. Prior to 1989, SNCFR was profitable since most of the freight and&#13;
passenger traffic was directed to the railway. As a result of reduced traffic and rising costs, SNCFR&#13;
began making operational losses. The net deficit, after depreciation and interest charges, was Lei&#13;
42.6 billion (US$138 million) in 1992, Lei 89.3 billion (US$126 million) in 1993, and Lei 420 billion&#13;
(US$ 250 million) in 1994. The situation is improving in 1995, with an expected deficit around&#13;
US$215 million.&#13;
4.8           Costs. Operating cost in SNCFR declined by 19.6% in constant terms between 1991&#13;
and 1993, as a result of a 10% reduction in the number of staff between 1991 and 1993 and energy&#13;
cost savings resulting from reduced traffic and operations. However, the decline in costs is only half&#13;
the decline in revenues of 42% in constant terms during the years 1991 to 1993, resulting from&#13;
reduced traffic and on account of tariff policy.&#13;
4.9          Tariffs. Over the period 1989 to 1993, freight tariffs increased 150 fold, well above&#13;
inflation for the period, as prices increased about 55 fold on average. Tariffs for passenger services&#13;
were increased 42 fold since 1989, and did not keep abreast with inflation. Revenues from freight&#13;
services cover 160% of cost and cross-subsidize passenger services which cover only 34% of direct&#13;
costs. Since December 1993, there was no increase in tariffs till May 1995, although inflation for the&#13;
year 1994 was 62%. In May 1995, freight tariffs were increased by 18% and passenger tariffs by&#13;
30% to 200% depending upon the type and class of service. Through reclassification of commodities&#13;
and passenger trains and services, the average freight revenue increased 30% and the average&#13;
passenger revenue almost 90%.&#13;
4.10          Government Contribution to operations have declined from US$43 million in 1991 to&#13;
US$22 million in 1992, and nil in 1993. In 1994, the Government compensated SNCFR for&#13;
subsidized tickets to retired persons and students. The large part of the Government's contribution in&#13;
the past has been towards capital overhaul of rail infrastructure. SNCFR includes the cost of capital&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
overhaul in its direct operating costs, according to current accounting practices in Romania. The&#13;
costs booked for capital overhaul depends, in part, on the budgetary resources available to carry out&#13;
such investment. Support from the Government for capital overhaul was US$128 million in 1991,&#13;
US$35 million in 1992, US$41 million in 1993, and US$155 million in 1994. These amounts have&#13;
not been adequate to address the backlog of capital overhaul that has accumulated over the past&#13;
several years. The total amount of Government's contributions to SNCFR in 1994 and 1995 is about&#13;
0.6% of GNP, and is consistent with the fiscal targets agreed with the International Monetary Fund&#13;
(IMF).&#13;
4.11         Accounts Receivable. SNCFR has been able to reduce accounts receivable from two&#13;
months of sales in 1993 to 1.6 months of sales equivalent to US$71 million in 1994. Of the US$71&#13;
million, about US$25 million are from foreign railways including the former Yugoslav railways.&#13;
Since there is no approved accounting policy on write off of doubtful receivables, these amounts&#13;
continue to be carried on SNCFR books. Under the Financial and Enterprise Sector Adjustment Loan&#13;
(FESAL), the Governrnent and Regie Autonomes, including SNCFR, have agreed on a policy on&#13;
writing off and/or rescheduling doubtful receivables. Of the remaining US$50 million of accounts&#13;
receivable, about half are receivables from other Regie Autonomes. SNCFR has stepped up efforts to&#13;
use aggressive collection measures such as refusal to release wagons unless past dues have been paid.&#13;
Such measures are expected to result in a reduction in accounts receivable which is part of the&#13;
FESAL loan conditionality.&#13;
4.12         Accounts Payable. SNCFR makes a distinction between payables to the Government&#13;
and to others. Payables to domestic suppliers, contractors and foreign railways is equivalent to 2.9&#13;
months of energy costs or US$47.3 million in 1994. The tight cash flow position of SNCFR in 1994&#13;
has decreased its ability to pay suppliers, contractors and foreign railways on time. SNCFR also&#13;
owes US$79 million equivalent to the Government for social security payments and taxes on salaries.&#13;
SNCFR is negotiating with the Government to reduce these payables to half, with a commitment to&#13;
pay the remaining half over a mutually agreed period of time.&#13;
4.13         Debt Service Obligations of SNCFR in 1994 was close to US$21 million. The&#13;
outstanding long-term debt as of 1994 is a total of US$96 million equivalent, comprising a Deutsche&#13;
Mark loan of US$75 million, and a Bank Loan of US$20 million under the Transport Project (Loan&#13;
3593-RO), as well as US$1.2 million to the Bank under the Technical Assistance and Critical Imports&#13;
Project (Loan 3363-RO).&#13;
C. Financial Forecasts&#13;
4.14         The financial forecasts, presented in Annex 2 (Table 1) are based on the operational&#13;
targets and staffing levels of the agreed RAP. The level of freight traffic and passenger traffic&#13;
estimated for 1995 is expected to remain constant in future years.&#13;
4.15         Future Tariff increases for freight and passenger services are projected at the levels&#13;
given in the Financial Recovery Plan (FRP) of SNCFR, which has been approved by the Government&#13;
and forms part of the FESAL loan agreement. Real increases in freight tariffs are projected only for&#13;
1996, after which freight tariffs are kept constant in real terms. SNCFR plans to increase base tariffs&#13;
for passenger services in real terms, so that they will cover about 80% of passenger service costs&#13;
before 2000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
4.16          Other revenue sources. SNCFR has many assets which have a potential commercial&#13;
value. In particular, the RAP indicates the surplus of motive power and rolling stock. SNCFR plans&#13;
to prepare all available scrap in the system for sale. Options for leasing and selling assets within&#13;
legally authorized means are being developed by SNCFR. If the domestic steel industry cannot&#13;
absorb all the scrap generated, SNCFR will explore options for sale of scrap abroad. Revenue&#13;
generation through sale of scrapped wagons and locomotives is estimated at about US$ 78 million.&#13;
This amount has been included in the financial projections, spread over the years 1996 to 1998.&#13;
4.17          Government Contribution. Once passenger tariffs have been increased in real terms to&#13;
cover costs of these services, there should be no contribution from the Government for operations,&#13;
except for those services which the Government would like SNCFR to continue under public service&#13;
obligation contracts. The level of Government capital contribution for infrastructure will determine&#13;
the level of expenditure on capital overhauls. Since SNCFR has a huge backlog of maintenance, the&#13;
financial projections assume Government capital contribution starting at US$150 million in 1995 and&#13;
declining to US$100 million in 2000. At present, these figures are consistent with the macro&#13;
economic targets agreed with the IMF, and roughly amount to 2.8% of the public sector's investment&#13;
budget. If the projected amounts are not allocated to SNCFR due to budgetary constraints, the&#13;
planned external overhaul will be deferred accordingly. SNCFR's budget, including the level of&#13;
Government's contribution, would be reviewed annually together with the Performance Contract&#13;
(paras. 2.25 and 6.1(b)).&#13;
4.18          Operating Costs. In the financial projections, total operating costs are expected to&#13;
decline by about 3% in constant terms each year. This reflects a reduction in the number of staff but&#13;
also includes an increase in wages per employee since the type of staff required will be better trained&#13;
and qualified. Energy costs are also expected to fall each year. Anticipated real price increases for&#13;
fuel will be contained through efficiency improvements.&#13;
4.19          Arrears. The financial forecasts target a reduction in accounts receivable from 1.6-&#13;
months of sales in 1994 to one-month of sales by 2000, by stepping up collection efforts. SNCFR&#13;
plans to reduce total accounts payable from 2.9 months of energy and material costs to 1.6 months of&#13;
energy and material costs by 2000. These targets are incorporated in the financial forecasts presented&#13;
in Annex 2 (Tables 1-2) and are consistent with the FESAL requirements.&#13;
4.20          Financial Targets. Based on the above described assumptions on tariff increases,&#13;
traffic levels, and Government contributions for capital overhaul, the financial performance of&#13;
SNCFR is expected to progressively improve throughout the life of the project. The financial targets&#13;
included in the RAP and confirmed at negotiations are: (a) working ratio not to exceed 1.2 in 1996,&#13;
1. 1 in 1997 and 1988, and 1.0 from 1999 onwards; and (b) debt service coverage ratio of 1.1 or&#13;
higher in 1996, 1.2 or higher from 1997 to 1998, and 1.5 or higher from 1999 onwards. SNCFR&#13;
will not incur any additional debts without prior Bank concurrence if the debt service coverage ratio&#13;
falls below 1.5. As a condition of Loan effectiveness, the Borrower will provide to the Bank&#13;
satisfactory evidence that measures have been taken allowing the Borrower to achieve the working&#13;
ratio for 1996 specified in the RAP.&#13;
4.21          Sensitivity Analysis has been carried out based on the following: (i) a decline in&#13;
passenger traffic by 10% from the base case; (ii) no real increases in tariffs in 1996; (iii) a reduction&#13;
in operating costs by 5% per year in constant terms; and (iv) a reduction in Government's&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
contribution for overhaul of infrastructure by half from the assumed level in base case; (v) and no&#13;
reduction in operating costs (salaries, energy, operation and maintenance) each year. As indicated in&#13;
Annex 2, in cases more unfavorable than the base case, SNCFR would have to adjust the amount of&#13;
capital overhaul to reduce costs. If traffic declines from the levels assumed in the base case, SNCFR&#13;
would probably need to further deepen its downsizing program. Such actions would be considered&#13;
during supervision and discussed in detail at the proposed mid-term review (para 3.18).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
V. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
5.1           With the traffic shortfall experienced over the last few years, SNCFR has excess&#13;
capacity but, due to years of skimping on maintenance and renewal, the quality and efficiency of&#13;
services have deteriorated. As a result, operating and maintenance costs are high. Project&#13;
components are directed to the rehabilitation of various parts of the system, such as track,&#13;
telecommunications, signalling, motive power, rolling stock and workshops. There are no capacity&#13;
increasing investments. Benefits of the project will be cost savings, improved safety and quality of&#13;
service. The better balance between costs and revenues, which would result from implementation of&#13;
the RAP and the project, is expected to reduce the fiscal burden of SNCFR on the Government's&#13;
budget.&#13;
Track Renewal and Maintenance on Priority Lines&#13;
5.2           This is the largest component, accounting for about 40% of total project cost. It&#13;
includes track renewal on major routes as well as plant and equipment for track maintenance. The&#13;
proposed project focuses on selected track renewal on major lines, all on the European network,&#13;
which are also the main priority rail routes in Romania and have a total length of about 6,100 track&#13;
km or about 30% of the total network. Track renewal and medium range maintenance are already&#13;
overdue on much of this network, considering the two standard criteria of accumulated gross ton-&#13;
kilometers and the number of years since the last major maintenance investment.  Because regular&#13;
maintenance has also been curtailed, and poor quality materials were used in previous rehabilitation&#13;
work, nearly half (2700 km) the total length of these priority lines are currently subject to speed&#13;
restrictions due to track condition. Priority sections for renewal (about 900 km) have been identified&#13;
on the basis of a thorough analysis of track conditions and importance of the traffic.&#13;
5.3           Poor track condition causes SNCFR serious problems: (a) speed restrictions must be&#13;
imposed and these mean that a larger fleet of locomotives and other rolling stock is required to carry&#13;
a given volume of traffic; (b) in some cases additional restrictions on permissible axles loadings are&#13;
necessary; (c) sub-standard track condition increases the cost of maintaining locomotives and rolling&#13;
stock; (d) many passenger services now take a longer time than competitive bus services could offer&#13;
on the same route and this, together with passenger discomfort, reduces the attractiveness of the&#13;
railway and will exacerbate the loss of traffic to road; (e) inadequate track maintenance increases the&#13;
risk of derailments which carry a heavy penalty in terms of operation disruption, and can result in&#13;
damage to the environment or, in a worst case, death and injury; and (f) when timely track&#13;
maintenance is not undertaken, the subsequent cost of bringing the track back to its normal operating&#13;
condition increases substantially. Furthermore, the accumulated backlog of track maintenance&#13;
becomes an increasingly significant burden - both financial and operational - on SNCFR.&#13;
5.4           Benefits. Restoring the track to its normal operating condition would give rise to&#13;
benefits which would result from:&#13;
-   reduced overhaul and maintenance costs, including future maintenance costs;&#13;
-   removal of speed restrictions;&#13;
-   reduced maintenance cost of traction and rolling stock; and&#13;
-   reduced incidence of derailments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
5.5          The evaluation period is taken as 20 years. Traffic on the 15 lines to be improved&#13;
under the project is estimated to comprise 25 % of total traffic. Based on the above, the internal&#13;
economic rate of return (ERR) of the investment in track renewal and track maintenance equipment is&#13;
about 30%. Detailed analysis of the benefits and calculations are presented in the Project File.&#13;
Integrated Railway Information System (IRIS)&#13;
5.6           The introduction of improved management information system would bring the&#13;
following benefits: reduce expenditures on foreign wagons used in Romania and better control of&#13;
domestic freight cars; reducing their empty running; and better control of sales of passenger tickets,&#13;
which combined with improved financial management, will improve cash flow management and result&#13;
in reduced interest costs. The ERR for this component is estimated at 52%.&#13;
Modernization of the Telecommunications Network&#13;
5.7           The modernization of telecommunications is a condition for improving the&#13;
management of the railways and the successful implementation of the IRIS and for supporting the&#13;
renewal of certain signalling systems. The main benefits will be savings in maintenance costs of the&#13;
existing overage system and expected revenues from non-railway users. The ERR is estimated at&#13;
27%. Alternative technologies have been considered, including the replacement of existing cables with&#13;
similar copper cables technology. Lately, fiber optic cables have become available at one fifth of the&#13;
cost of traditional copper cables and this solution has been retained for the project. Excess capacity&#13;
will be leased to other large users such as Banks and tourist organizations. Even if such leasing is&#13;
delayed the ERR will remain acceptable.&#13;
Risks&#13;
5.8          Given the political uncertainties in Romania, there is a risk that some of the more&#13;
difficult decisions embodied in the RAP regarding staff reductions and tariff increases will be delayed.&#13;
There is also a risk for further shift of traffic away from rail if SNCFR does not improve its&#13;
commercial orientation and compete for traffic with private truckers. The measures taken up-front&#13;
(para. 2.23) have been very significant and indicate that SNCFR and the Government are committed&#13;
to restructuring. The proposed mid-term review (para. 3.18) would provide an opportunity to assess&#13;
the situation and recommend any additional measures or changes in the project that may be required.&#13;
The physical components do not pose significant risks, since all investments are for rehabilitation of&#13;
the core components of the system which would have high priority under any restructuring scenario.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
6.2    The following are conditions of Loan effectiveness:&#13;
(a)    that the Borrower (SNCFR) shall have provided to the Bank satisfactory evidence that&#13;
measures have been taken allowing the Borrower to achieve the working ratio for&#13;
1996 specified in the RAP; and&#13;
(b)    that all the effectiveness conditions of the EBRD loan (other than those related to the&#13;
effectiveness of the Bank Loan) have been met (para.3.5).&#13;
6.3    With the above assurances and conditions, the project would be suitable for a Bank Loan of&#13;
US$120 million equivalent to SNCFR, with the guarantee of Romania, for a 20-year term including a&#13;
five-year grace period.&#13;

ROMANIA&#13;
RAILWAY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS AND SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS&#13;
1.         The financial projections for the period 1995 to 2000 for the Romanian National&#13;
Railways (SNCFR) are presented in Tables 1 this Annex. The major assumptions underlying these&#13;
projections have been described in Chapter IV of the SAR.&#13;
2.         The financial position of SNCFR, during the process of restructuring, is vulnerable to&#13;
some key risk factors. Sensitivity of the financial parameters to these factors have been carried out&#13;
as follows: (i) no cost reduction from the level assumed in Base Case; (ii) no real tariff increases in&#13;
1996; (iii) a reduction in Government's contribution for overhaul of infrastructure by half each year&#13;
from the assumed level in Base Case; and (iv) a decline in passenger traffic by 10% over the next&#13;
five years. Table 2 of this Annex presents the sensitivity of the two key financial parameters (the&#13;
Working Ratio and the Debt Service Coverage Ratio) to these risk factors. As can be seen from the&#13;
Table 2, SNCFR will not be able to meet the financial targets set in the RAP, unless steps are&#13;
taken to mitigate the impact of these adverse circumstances.&#13;
3.         The impact of the risk factors on the key financial parameters and the steps to reduce&#13;
the impact of such risks, if they take place, are described below.&#13;
Scenario 1: If there will be no reduction in costs (salaries, energy, operation and maintenance)&#13;
for the nextfive years, SNCFR would not be able to meet the financial targets specified in the&#13;
RAP. Although its working ratio will gradually improve from 1.28 in 1995 to 1.10 in 2001, but&#13;
still higher than the required minimum level of 1.0. As for its debt service coverage ratio, it will&#13;
improve from -0.85 in 1995 to 2.02 in 1998, surpassing the targeted level of 1.5, but will drastically&#13;
drop to 0.49 in 2000 and to 0.21 in 2001.&#13;
However, this is unlikely to happen since Base Case assumes only a 3% annual reduction (in&#13;
constant terms) in total operating costs which is a conservative assumption. In fact, given the&#13;
agreed staff reduction plan (which currently accounts for about 60% of total costs) and possible&#13;
energy cost savings, an additional cost reduction of 5% per year in constant terms from Base Case&#13;
is likely. Anticipated real price increase for fuel would be contained through efficiency&#13;
improvements, and investment in modem working systems, and technology and management&#13;
techniques would result in a further reduction in overall maintenance and administrative costs.&#13;
Therefore, it is unlikely that identified direct costs of SNCFR's operations will not decrease during&#13;
the project implementation. The measures already taken up-front indicate that SNCFR and the&#13;
Government are committed to restructuring. Moreover, the proposed mid-term review would&#13;
provide an opportunity to assess that situation and recommend any changes in the project that may&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

be required.&#13;
Scenario 2: If there will be no real increase in tariffs in 1996, SNCFR would not be able meet&#13;
the targeted working ratio or debt service coverage ratio during the project implementation. Under&#13;
the Base Case, real increases in freight tariffs are projected only for 1996, after which freight&#13;
tariffs are kept constant in real terms. With regard to passenger tariffs, SNCFR is expected to&#13;
increase base tariffs by 19%, 20%, 10% in real terms for 1996, 1997, and 1998, respectively.&#13;
These projected levels are based on SNCFR's Financial Recovery Plan, which has been approved by&#13;
the Government and forms part of the FESAL Loan Agreement.&#13;
Without these projected real increases in tariffs, the implementation of financial targets would&#13;
collapse (see Table 2 of this Annex). SNCFR's debt service coverage ratio would be only -0.47 in&#13;
1996 and continues to be below 1.0 thereafter (except in 1988), which is well below the targeted&#13;
level of 1.5. Similarly, its working ratio would be vulnerable as they are significantly higher than&#13;
the minimum required level of 1.0 throughout the project implementation. This indicates that&#13;
SNCFR would continue operating at a loss. Moreover, SNCFR's operations would further&#13;
deteriorate rapidly for lack of proper routine maintenance due to lack of operating funds. Under&#13;
this situation, SNCFR would have to have very high passenger tariff increases through the years&#13;
1997 and 1988 to compensate no increase in 1996.&#13;
Therefore, the key issue in the sustainability of SNCFR's financial position is its commitment to&#13;
tariff increases as specified in the RAP for both freight and passenger services. Given the political&#13;
and economic uncertainties in Romania, there is a possibility of delays in the tariff increases. In&#13;
order to mitigate this risk, it was agreed at negotiations that the Government will permit SNCFR to&#13;
set (or increase) tariffs for freights and passenger tariffs according to market conditions so that&#13;
SNCFR will be able to meet the financial targets set in the RAP. Also, the draft Railway Law&#13;
specifies that if tariff increases are not permitted due to political or social reasons, the Government&#13;
is obliged to pay public service obligations (PSOs) to SNCFR (para 2.22). These PSOs are included&#13;
in the Performance Contract between the Government and SNCFR. This Contract will present the&#13;
planned tariff increases and will update annually in consultation with the Bank (para 2.25).&#13;
Furthermore, the proposed Loan would not become effective unless SNCFR would provided to the&#13;
Bank satisfactory evidence that measures have been taken to allow SNCFR to achieve working ratio&#13;
for 1996 specified in the RAP.&#13;
Scenario 3: If Government's contribution for overhaul of infrastructure would be reduced by half&#13;
each year during the project implementation, there would be no impact on the working ratio since&#13;
the definition of this ratio excludes Government's contribution for capital overhaul expenditures and&#13;
the direct costs of capital overhaul. However, as indicated in Table 2 of this Annex, it will&#13;
adversely affect the debt service coverage ratio; -0.97 in 1996, 0.41 in 1997 and continues to be&#13;
below 0.5 thereafter, which are considerably below the targeted level of 1.5 as specified in the&#13;
RAP.&#13;
Under such circumstances, SNCFR would have to adjust the amount of capital overhaul to reduce&#13;
costs since the level of the Government's capital contribution for infrastructure will determine the&#13;
level of expenditure on capital overhauls. The Base Case assumes that about 300 kms of capital&#13;
overhaul will be carried out each year for which the required contribution from the Government&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

would be about US$150 million. But, the proposed project requires a minimum of around 150 kms&#13;
to be overhauled each year (that is 900 kms through the life of the project), which is 50% of what is&#13;
currently assumed to be carried out each year in Base Case.&#13;
Thus, even if the Government's contribution would be reduced by half each year, SNCFR could still&#13;
meet most of the required capital overhaul expenditure for the project. To minimize the impact of&#13;
the Government's contribution, SNCFR's budget, including level of Government's contribution, will&#13;
be reviewed annually with the Performance Contract (paras. 2.25 and 6.1 (b)).&#13;
Scenario 4: If the passenger traffic were to decline by 10% for the next five years, SNCFR would&#13;
not be able to meet the financial targets. In order for SNCFR to achieve the said targets, SNCFR&#13;
would have to increase passenger tariffs substantially to compensate the high transport costs caused&#13;
by the reduced traffic level. There is room for increasing passenger tariffs since they are relatively&#13;
low when compared to other CEE countries in terms of purchasing power parity. Also, given that&#13;
40% of passenger traffic is by rail, SNCFR could improve safety and quality of service (punctuality,&#13;
cleanliness in trains, better coaches) and increase tariffs accordingly. SNCFR has had some success&#13;
improving quality and increasing tariffs on one of its inter-city lines. In addition, SNCFR may&#13;
need to further deepen its downsizing program and reduce the network. Such actions would be&#13;
considered during supervision and would be discussed in detail at the proposed mid-term review.&#13;
Furthermore, considering the present political and economic circumstances, this risk has been&#13;
mitigated by replying upon conservative assumptions of railway traffic projections.&#13;
4.    The sensitivity of the key financial parameters to the risks described above is great, but&#13;
could be mitigated with the steps proposed under the project. The main risks identified above are of&#13;
policy slippage due to changes in political environment and would be caused by further deterioration&#13;
of economic conditions. Since these risks are outside the Bank's control, the proposed mid-term&#13;
review will determine progress in achieving development objectives of the project and any necessary&#13;
restructuring thereof. Moreover, if, during the course of implementation of the project, it becomes&#13;
apparent that the risks of no real increase in passenger tariffs and the decline in traffic are greater&#13;
than those assumed in Base Case, then the proposed mid-term review will be used as an opportunity&#13;
to deepen the restructuring process, and reduce the network and SNCFR's staff further than what is&#13;
proposed (para 3.18).&#13;

RAILWAY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Review&#13;
Environmental Screening&#13;
1. 1.        This project is assigned in Category B for the purposes of environmental screening, required&#13;
for World Bank lending operations. Following the guidelines of Operational Directive 4.01 of the Bank, a&#13;
review of the environmental problems in the Romanian railways (SNCFR) has been carried out by a team of&#13;
Bank and railways' environmental experts. The team assessed the expected environmental impact of the&#13;
proposed project, and the capacity to deal with enviromnental issues in railway operations. The&#13;
environmental review confirmed that the type of rehabilitation and maintenance envisaged for the project&#13;
would have relatively minor environmental impacts, limited to the existing railroad and workshops/depots.&#13;
Railway restructuring would improve the competitiveness of the railway vis-a-vis the automobile transport&#13;
(which causes more serious threat to the environment) and, as a result, would bring overall environmental&#13;
benefits. Rehabilitation and better maintenance of both track park and workshops would reduce pollution in&#13;
railway operations. In addition, assistance could be provided under the project to strengthen the&#13;
environmental protection capacity of the railways, as well as to set priorities and address the most urgent&#13;
environmental problems.&#13;
1. 2.        The proposed railway restructuring would eliminate inefficient activities, and would gradually&#13;
reduce the number of lines and stations in operation. The environmental consequences of lines/stations&#13;
closures (e. g. polluted loading and unloading areas, abandoned underground and above ground storage tanks&#13;
used for hazardous chemicals, transformers and other facilities, waste disposal areas) should be subject to&#13;
environmental auditing. The mission alerted both the railways and the environmental authorities on the need&#13;
of proper regulations to assure that auditing and mitigation measures would be in place. A draft&#13;
Environmental Law, currently in the Parliament, is expected to impose auditing requirements to restructuring&#13;
operations and clarify the environmental liability for past pollution. Until this Law is approved by the&#13;
Parliament, restructuring activities with expected environmental impacts should be reviewed by authorized&#13;
joint teams of representatives of the Regional Environmental Branches (set in each of the 41 administrative&#13;
regions) and the regional railways branch or by representatives of the Ministry of Waters, Forests and&#13;
Environment and the central railways administration (depending on the scale of any particular operation).&#13;
Environmental Problems in Railway Operations and Maintenance&#13;
2. 1.        While railway transportation is relatively safe for the environment, some production and&#13;
maintenance processes, associated with the railways (e.g., loading and unloading of hazardous cargo,&#13;
application of chemicals, use of fuels, locomotives and car maintenance and car hygiene) may cause a&#13;
negative environmental impact. Normally the scale of this impact is relatively modest.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 3&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
Contribution of rail operations on air pollution is minimal and there are no severe problems associated with&#13;
traffic noise, water pollution, soil contamination in loading and unloading areas, spills of hazardous cargo and&#13;
waste disposal. During the last decade concerns for growing negative environmental externalities in&#13;
automobile transport have led most of the developed countries to policy measures (including heavy taxes on&#13;
gasoline and road charges), which encourage shift of freight and passenger traffic from motorways to&#13;
railroads. While Romania's auto transport is far less developed than in the West, and road congestion is still&#13;
a rare case, mostly occurring in the major urban centers, there is a clear trend toward road expansion, which&#13;
would bring over time the same environmental problems as those experienced in the developed market&#13;
economies. There is an extensive rail network and new construction would not be required (neither under the&#13;
proposed operation, nor in the near future). With regard to the above, a railway rehabilitation project is&#13;
expected to bring overall environmental benefits.&#13;
2. 2.         The environmental review has indicated that normal concerns for railways such as disposal&#13;
and recycling of waste (including oil), cleaning of tank sediments, water treatment, use of chemicals for track&#13;
maintenance, and transport of hazardous materials are covered by the national regulations. While mitigation&#13;
measures are in place in the railway practice, their enforcement is not fully satisfactory and the quality of&#13;
environmental performance should be improved.&#13;
2. 3.         Environmental management. Since 1991, the railways have initiated some steps to improve&#13;
the environmental protection management. Environmental expert positions were created in the central&#13;
administration and in the regional branches. Recent new requirements of the environmental authorities led to&#13;
establishment of environmental councils in depots and workshops, chaired by the deputy directors in charge&#13;
of production. A total of 340 railways staff are currently employed in environmental protection activities,&#13;
including car hygiene and landscape maintenance. Under the current organizational structure, however, staff&#13;
employed in these activities are requested to perform other functions (e. g., fire protection, labor protection&#13;
etc.). This is regarded as a negative factor for the quality of the environmental services. The technical&#13;
experts are highly qualified and make all efforts to carry out their tasks within the severe resource constraints.&#13;
2. 4.         Despite these efforts, a number of serious problems exist in the railways, due to the legacy of&#13;
past environ-mental neglect, current financial difficulties and weak enforcement of the existing environmental&#13;
standards and regulations. Among these are: (i) rapidly deteriorating equipment in hygiene stations; (ii) lack&#13;
of chemicals for car cleaning and track maintenance; (iii) outdated waste water treatment facilities in some&#13;
depots and maintenance stations; (iv) insufficient distribution of safety instructions and procedures for&#13;
operations involving hazard to human health (e.g., oil change in transformers, spread of chemicals for track&#13;
maintenance, appropriate car hygiene); (v) noise in some stations (due to bad city planning); and (vi)&#13;
operational staff negligence to environmental protection requirements.&#13;
2. 5.         Air Pollution. Air pollution caused by mobile and point sources in the railways is modest.&#13;
The mobile sources consist of a total of 700 diesel locomotives, consuming approximately 275 thousand tones&#13;
diesel fuel per year. It is estimated that the annual emissions of CO are 3,100 tonnes, and of CO2 -- 7,000&#13;
tonnes. These emissions are spread over a large territory and do not cause any significant environmental&#13;
damage. There are cases, however, when locomotives are operated inefficiently, and as a result the overall&#13;
emissions in industrialized and populated areas (around main train stations) are higher than the operational&#13;
standards. Locomotive maintenance, better quality fuel and staff awareness of ways to improve the&#13;
environmental performance of diesel locomotives would contribute to decrease of emissions. The&#13;
environmiental staff at the railways should propose measures for achieving better environmental performance&#13;
(including improved maintenance schemes and training of personnel).&#13;

Thermal power plants, constructed to provide heating for railway depots, maintenance stations and&#13;
hygiene stations (those built in the last decades also serve residential and industrial buildings), form the point&#13;
sources of air pollution. Emissions from power plants, operating on oil and gas, are usually within the&#13;
environmental standards, whereas coal-operated power plants often exceed these standards. The total CO2&#13;
emissions from thermal power plants equal 106,000 tonnes, and the SO2 emissions equal 2,200 tonnes. The&#13;
railways are required to present detailed environmental impact studies for all point sources in order to get&#13;
pollution permits. Such studies are available only for a limited number of power plants due to budgetary&#13;
constraints. In case it is decided that these power plants would stay within the organizational structure of the&#13;
railways (although it might be more efficient to separate them and contract out their services), the necessary&#13;
funding for completion of EIA studies and mitigation plans should be provided in order to comply with the&#13;
environmental regulations.&#13;
2. 7.         Water pollution. All depots, workstations and stations for car hygiene are equipped with&#13;
waste water treatment facilities, built before 1975. Almost all facilities need rehabilitation and/or upgrade.&#13;
Waste water discharge appears to be the most significant case of systematic violation of Romania's&#13;
environmental standards by the railways. In Bradu Rafinarie, Ghighiu, Faurei and Arad the local&#13;
environmental authorities have monitored systematic violations of the standards. There are about 35 project&#13;
proposals for rehabilitation of the waste water treatment facilities, for a total of US$ 26.6 million that have&#13;
been prepared in the last years, but can not be carried out due to financial constraints. Currently the level of&#13;
fines is relatively low (below the costs of compliance) and often the railways avoid paying any fines. In&#13;
depot and workshops where the management is proactive both good housekeeping and low cost solutions are&#13;
implemented and the pollution problems are significantly reduced.&#13;
2. 8.         Waste disposal. Solid waste is generated both in operations and maintenance. In operations,&#13;
waste problems (passenger and cargo waste) occur mostly in the depot and maintenance stations. While for&#13;
passenger waste the key problem is waste disposal, leftovers in cars from freight cargo could also lead to soil&#13;
and ground water contamination, and create health risks for the maintenance staff. Freight cars are often sent&#13;
for maintenance with non-identified, possibly hazardous, cargo leftovers. Trash is often spread around&#13;
stations and along the tracks (caused by improper loading, unloading and handling, passenger neglect and lack&#13;
of proper dumping sites). Scrap from maintenance, as well as from decommissioning of locomotives and&#13;
cars, is normally sold for recycling.&#13;
2. 9.         Noise. Until recently noise was not considered a problem in the railways. It was proven,&#13;
however, that in Bucharest, lasi, and Arad, the level of noise caused by the railways significantly exceeds&#13;
Romanian standards. Due to bad residential planning in the past, there are places where the distance between&#13;
the rail road and the residential buildings is less than 25 meters. Both noise and vibration are higher than the&#13;
standards. Low quality of signaling equipment requires excessive use of train whistling. The railways are&#13;
now paying fines for noise. In order to encourage creative solutions to the noise and vibration problems, the&#13;
railways should be offered the possibility to negotiate a compliance schedule, which would provide time for&#13;
resolving this problem.&#13;
2. 10.        Chemical application in track maintenance. All chemicals for track maintenance are tested&#13;
and approved by the ministries of health and of agriculture. Due to severe financial constraints there is&#13;
shortage of chemicals, which prevents proper track maintenance and imposes safety risks. Under the&#13;
circumstances railways staff tend to use whatever chemicals they find available, creating potential&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
environmental damage for the crops in the railroads area, as well as consecutive health risks. Provision of&#13;
chemicals should be assured, and proper monitoring of the application -- established over time.&#13;
2. 11.        Veterinarian control and car hygiene. Currently there are 11 specialized stations. While&#13;
supervision of these stations is under the Ministry of Transport, all costs are covered by the railways. These&#13;
stations operate according to regulations for hygiene parameters, usage of cleaning chemicals and hygiene&#13;
control. Most of the existing stations need rehabilitation and expansion. In almost all of them the existing&#13;
waste water treatment facilities are inadequate. Incinerators are not available, and often waste is stored in&#13;
municipal waste disposal sites without proper handling. Often freight cars are not directed to the stations by&#13;
station personnel (either due to shortage of cars, or because of negligence of staff, involved in loading and&#13;
unloading operations).&#13;
2. 12.        Currently the managerial and financial organization of the railways does not encourage cost&#13;
recovery in freight car cleaning. Both revenues from and expenditures for the hygiene services are&#13;
centralized in the railways' consolidated budget. The tariffs for these services are not linked to costs (only&#13;
for oil cars cleaning the tariff is set at a higher level). In addition, the costs for cleaning for some types of&#13;
cargo are higher than the fine that can be imposed on the user for violating the sanitary regulations. Many&#13;
users prefer to pay the fines and transfer the responsibility and the costs for car cleaning to the sanitary&#13;
stations.&#13;
2. 13.        Costs of non-compliance. The lack of ineffective environmental measures are the reasons for&#13;
the railways to pay fines to the environmental authorities. No data is currently available for the total amount&#13;
of fines levied on the railway. It was reported that the railway branches usually avoid the fines, negotiating&#13;
allowances with the local environmental authorities. According to the Ministry for Waters, Forests and&#13;
Protection of the Environment (MWFPE), the strengthening of the environmental management system and&#13;
dependance of the environmental authorities on revenues from fines would eliminate this practice. In&#13;
addition, the MWFPE is planning to increase the fines significantly, as well to introduce new compliance&#13;
incentives (charges and taxes). Expected increases in pollution fines and charges will impose additional losses&#13;
to the railways. An economic and financial analysis should be carried out to determine high priority&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance expenditures, needed to avoid further losses. Additional costs occur at oil cars&#13;
hygiene stations -- due to outdated equipment and lack of chemicals the railways are forced to contract&#13;
external services in order to maintain the hygiene in the oil cars.&#13;
2. 14.        Staff performance. Staff in many hygiene stations and depots are very devoted to carrying&#13;
out their tasks, even with obsolete equipment. In some places, however, the environmental problems are&#13;
escalated by bad housekeeping and staff negligence. Services like waste handling and disposal are very&#13;
unattractive and even the current high unemployment level does not assure a reliable number of staff. Some&#13;
of the railways' branches (e.g., the one in Brashov) are contracting hygiene services to private firms, which&#13;
seems to contribute to quality improvements. There are, however, trade union constraints to broader&#13;
application of the contracting practice, since it leads to loss of permanent jobs.&#13;
Recommendations&#13;
3. 1.         It was concluded that additional efforts would be required to assure that environmental&#13;
concerns are properly reflected in management decisions and in day-to-day operations. For this purpose, a&#13;
small environmental team should be formed on a director level, with the authority to report directly to the&#13;
Managerial Board.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
56 -&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 5 of 5&#13;
3. 2.    For the proposed operation the following steps are recommended:&#13;
(i)  Environmental management capacity building: as indicated in paragraph 3. 1., environmental&#13;
management team should be set on a high level; the Environmental Specialist position in the&#13;
central administration should be clearly defined in detailed Terms of Reference; training&#13;
should be provided according to TOR; proper documentation and communications among the&#13;
central administration and the regional branches should be established; and&#13;
(ii)    Setting environmental priorities: an environmental performance review for the railways&#13;
should be prepared and proposals should be made for (a) no cost and low cost environmental&#13;
improvements (including better housekeeping, improved enforcement of environmental&#13;
regulations and training of personnel) and (b) targeted use of funds according to the&#13;
identified priorities on the basis of environmental, economic, and financial considerations.&#13;
3. 3.    Terms of Reference for the environmental performance review should be prepared jointly by the&#13;
railways and the Bank. The report should be presented to the Bank for review as a part of the environmental&#13;
screening of the operation. Highest priority actions in rehabilitation of hygiene equipment, and supply of&#13;
chemicals for veterinarian control and track maintenance are likely environmental investments to be financed&#13;
under this project.&#13;

ROMANIA&#13;
RAILWAY REHABILITATION PROJECT&#13;
Project Implementation Plan&#13;
Project objectives&#13;
1.     The objective of the project is to support the restructuring process which SNCFR and the Government&#13;
have initiated. SNCFR has prepared a six-year Restructuring Action Plan 1995-2000 (RAP). This plan&#13;
including operational and financial targets is in Annex 1 of the Bank's Staff Appraisal Report (SAR). It gives&#13;
the objectives to be attained, the actions needed to reach the objectives, responsibilities for these actions and&#13;
their timing.&#13;
Proiect description&#13;
2.     The items to be partially financed by IBRD and EBRD are high priority items for the rehabilitation of&#13;
the core network and equipment of the railways, necessary to improve performance and reduce costs in order&#13;
to achieve the targets set in the RAP. The description of the project components, their cost estimates (foreign&#13;
and local costs, the latter including an estimate of taxes and duties), the proposed financing plan are in&#13;
Sections B, C and D of Chapter III of the SAR.&#13;
3.     To further support the execution of the RAP, SNCFR's personnel needs training, particularly in the&#13;
fields of modern management, marketing, finance and accounting, strategic planning, commercial operation,&#13;
environment and new techniques of operation, including greater computerization of various activities. The&#13;
agreed training program, to be financed by the project, is in Table 1 of this Annex. Its implementation will&#13;
start within 4 months of Effectiveness and progress will be reviewed at the occasion of Bank's supervision&#13;
missions and at least annually.&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
4.     The Project will be implemented by SNCFR. A Project management team will be established by&#13;
SNCFR and remain in operation and fully staffed throughout execution of the project.&#13;
5.     A new railway law, specifying inter alia the relationship between the railways and the Government is&#13;
to be approved by Parliament. According to the law, SNCFR and the Government will enter into multi-year&#13;
Performance Contracts that will be updated annually. These contracts will govern the respective SNCFR and&#13;
State responsibilities and specify operational and financial objectives, staff levels, public service support,&#13;
capital contribution for infrastructure and other investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 2 of 9&#13;
6.     The role of the Bank during project implementation is in section H of Chapter 3 of the SAR. It will&#13;
in particular include a mid-term review in 1998 or 18-24 months after Effectiveness. The criteria to be used&#13;
in carrying out the mid-term review will be same as agreed in the RAP.&#13;
Implementation Plan&#13;
7.     The implementation plan is given in a set of tables attached to this Annex:&#13;
Items eligible for IBRD financing are detailed in Table 2;&#13;
-    The timetable for the bidding process is in Table 3;&#13;
-    The procurement plan, including the implementation schedule for each project component, with&#13;
details of the tendering process, such as the number of contracts for each item, the procurement&#13;
method and the schedule for bidding and awarding contracts (Table 4); and&#13;
-    The Implementation Schedule with the estimated annual contractual and other payments is in&#13;
Table 5. This disbursement schedule is somewhat different from the IBRD disbursement&#13;
schedule shown in Table 10 of the SAR, which reflects a more conservative estimate. SNCFR&#13;
will do its best to meet the schedule given in Table 5.&#13;
8.     The financial and economic analyses of the project, including the assumptions made in preparing these&#13;
analyses, are in Chapters IV and V of the SAR. Details are in Annex 2 and in the Project File.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
9.     The indicators that will be monitored for measuring progress towards the project objectives are the&#13;
following four parameters included in the RAP (Annex 1, Pages 11, 12): (a) a further staff reduction and&#13;
staff productivity from the level reached in 1994; (b) scrapping and selling rolling stock (locomotives, wagons&#13;
and couches); (c) utilization of traction and rolling stock. and (d) the financial targets (working ratio and debt&#13;
service coverage ratio). Periodic reporting on the project would include reporting on these targets and every&#13;
supervision mission (at least twice a year) would monitor progress in these four key areas, and agree with the&#13;
railways on remedies in case of slippage. The RAP will be included as a schedule to the Loan Agreement.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The objective of the Railway
            Rehabilitation Project is to support and deepen the
            restructuring process which Societatea Nationala a Cailor
            Ferate Romane (SNCFR), the Romanian national railways, and
            the government have initiated. The project supports a set of
            policy measures that are embodied in the new Railway Law,
            the Restructuring Action Plan (RAP), and the performance
            contract between SNCFR and the government. The project will
            only finance investments, which would be required even under
            pessimistic traffic assumptions and would be in line with
            the restructuring objectives. They are: 1) track renewal and
            maintenance on priority routes; 2) integrated railway
            information system (IRIS); 3) telecommunications and
            signalling; 4) environmental improvement; 5) traction and
            depots improvements; 6) rehabilitation of passenger coaches
            and freight wagons; and 7) technical services.
