STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
Credit and Project Summary&#13;
Borrower:                           Republic of Albania&#13;
Beneficiary:                        General Roads Directorate (GRD) in the&#13;
Ministry of Construction and Toi'r !na (MCT)&#13;
Credit Amount                       SDR 17.4 million(US$25.0 million equivalent)&#13;
Terms:                              Standard IDA terms, with 40 years maturity&#13;
Project Objectives and Description:    The main objectives of the project are to: (i)&#13;
overcome a key infrastructure bottleneck to&#13;
economic development by rehabilitating and&#13;
constructing national roads;  (ii) improve the&#13;
maintenance and safety of national roads; (iii)&#13;
promote the development of the local contracting&#13;
and consulting industries; and (iv) train GRD's&#13;
staff and develop strong cooperation between&#13;
GRD and the University of Tirana.&#13;
The project includes: (i) rehabilitation of about 90&#13;
km of national roads in the East-West and&#13;
Northern corridors (US$45.0 million, exclu-&#13;
ding contingencies); (ii) provision of road&#13;
maintenance and safety equipment (US$7.0&#13;
million);  (iii) supervision of works (US$1.4&#13;
million); (iv) establishment of a road data bank,&#13;
pavement management system, and bridge&#13;
management system (US$2.0 million); and (v)&#13;
employment of consultants to coordinate the&#13;
project and for TA and to train GRD and RRD&#13;
executive  staff  in  the  management  and&#13;
modernization of the road sector, including&#13;
collaboration with the University of Tirana,&#13;
Faculty of Civil Engineering (US$2.3 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ii&#13;
Benefits and Risks:                  The GOA has expressed a strong interest in the&#13;
project and considers it to be urgent. The project&#13;
is expected to play an important role in facilitating&#13;
economic development.  The main quantified&#13;
project benefits include savings in vehicle&#13;
operating costs and in road maintenance costs.&#13;
Unquantifiable benefits include the reductions in&#13;
road accidents, promotion of domestic contracting&#13;
and   consulting,  institutional  improvements,&#13;
environmental  improvemenits.  and  increased&#13;
collaboration between GRD and the University of&#13;
Tirana. The project is estimated to have an ERR&#13;
of about 26 %.&#13;
The main project risks are that:  (i) the project&#13;
would exceed GRD and MCT' s institutional&#13;
capacity; (ii) GOA might not hiave sufficient&#13;
counterpart funds for the project; (iii) GOA would&#13;
not be able to establish a system for administrating&#13;
and financing non-GRD roads; and (iv) GRD&#13;
might undertake uneconomic investments.  In&#13;
order to reduce these risks, GOA agreed at&#13;
negotiations to (i) appoint a project coordinator&#13;
and adequately staff the Proiect Implementation&#13;
Unit (PIU); (ii) budget sufticient counterpart funds&#13;
for the project and allocate funds first to&#13;
maintenance  and  thereafter  to  other  road&#13;
expenditures; (iii) implement an action plan&#13;
defining every project action to be performed and&#13;
the latest date to start each action; and (iv) consult&#13;
with the Association on its transport investment&#13;
plans annually. Project risks are considered to be&#13;
acceptable with these arrangements.&#13;

I. THE ECONOMY AND THE TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. Economy&#13;
1.01   Albania is largely a rural economy, with agriculture generating 56 percent of output,&#13;
and industry plus construction only 21 percent. After the economic collapse in 1990-91,&#13;
output declined nearly 33 percent in real terms. In 1993, the new government initiated a&#13;
program of macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms with IMF and Bank support.&#13;
As a result of firm commitment to the progi un by the Government, measured economic&#13;
growth has been rapid, with output increasing 9.6 percent in 1993, 9.4 percent in 1994 and 8.6&#13;
percent in 1995. Indications are that growth in the informal sector was substantially higher.&#13;
Since the implementation of the stabilization of adjustment program in 1992, the country has&#13;
made substantial progress in achieving macroeconomic stability. Inflation has fallen from&#13;
226 percent per annum in 1992 to 6 percent by the end of 1995, which is substantially below&#13;
the 10 percent targeted in the Government's program; in three months during the past year a&#13;
price deflation was observed. The currency has been freely floating since 1992, and the&#13;
exchange rate has remained fairly stable in nominal terms. Economic recovery was also a&#13;
major factor in absorbing registered unemployment, which declined from a peak of 37 percent&#13;
of the labor force in March 1993 to 13 percent in 1995. Despite these significant advances,&#13;
however, the level of GDP in Albania is the lowest in Europe; its 3.2 million inhabitants had&#13;
an average annual income of $540 in 1995 (World Bank Atlas methodology).&#13;
1.02  Despite rehabilitation works carried out during the last two years, most of Albania's&#13;
infrastructure is in poor condition. The main road network is in significantly worse condition&#13;
than elsewhere in post-Communist Europe, as explained below. About one-third of the&#13;
population is effectively cut off from markets because rural roads are in such poor condition.&#13;
The country's main airport and port both require rehabilitation. About 400 municipalities&#13;
cannot be reached by telephone. Electricity outages were frequent during the severe winter of&#13;
1994-95, which put enormous strain on existing transmission and distribution networks, and&#13;
winter outages are still common. The water supply is unreliable, affecting production and&#13;
public health. This project is consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy Paper&#13;
which was discussed by the Board on March 8, 1994. The CAS identified infrastructure&#13;
bottlenecks as a significant constraint to implementing the stabilization program and&#13;
promoting economic development. Improving the condition of the main road network is the&#13;
focus of the proposed project.&#13;
1.03  The government is also implementing a successful privatization program. Following&#13;
privatization of state farms and cooperative land, the government focused on the sale of small-&#13;
and medium-sized enterprises. Currently, only a few of these enterprises remain public, as over&#13;
3,000 enterprises and asset units were sold by mid-1995. The Government created the&#13;
Enterprise Restructuring Agency (ERA), which has been very successful in downsizing what&#13;
remains. Employment in 32 ERA enterprises dropped from 49,000 in 1992 to 6,500 by end-&#13;
1995. Liquidation was initiated in six enterprises, the assets of twelve enterprises are currently&#13;
being sold, five enterprises have been auctioned off through the Mass Privatization Program, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
the remaining nine companies are expected to be privatized during future rounds in 1996. The&#13;
project would support privatization by contracting out maintenance activities.&#13;
B. The Transport Sector&#13;
1.04  System and Infrastructure. The transport system is based on: (i) a road network of&#13;
about 16,000 km which is described in Chapter 11; (ii) a rail network of 543 km, of which 509&#13;
km are standard gauge and 34 km are narrow gauge, and none are double track or electrified,&#13;
(iii) the main port of Durres with 2,563 m of quays, and secondary ports of Vlora, Saranda&#13;
and Shengjini; (iv) inland navigation on the Drin river; and (v) an international airport at&#13;
Tirana (Rinas) with a 2,700 m runway The transport system is generally adequate in extent,&#13;
but mostly in poor or fair condition.&#13;
1.05  Sector Transformation. Under the previous regime, the Government emphasized&#13;
transport by railways, and goods were moved to or from the railhead by a fleet of small,&#13;
publicly owned trucks. Private automobiles and commercial road transport were forbidden,&#13;
and there was little international transport. Market reforms have had a dramatic effect on&#13;
transport demand. Railway freight traffic fell from 6.6 million tons in 1990 to 574,000 tons in&#13;
1995 due primarily to the closure of uneconomic mines and heavy industries, and the&#13;
liberalization of road transport. Railway passenger traffic declined from 12 million trips in&#13;
1990 to 3.8 million in 1995 (Annex 1.1). Distances are relatively short in Albania, which,&#13;
coupled with the development of small-scale agricultural and commercial activities and&#13;
transport deregulation, has favored the development of road transport. From a low base, the&#13;
number of registered automobiles has grown 30-fold and the number of trucks and buses four-&#13;
fold since 1990. The road fleet totaled 109,644 vehicles in 1995 (Annex 1.2). Even&#13;
considering the remaining public sector trucking fleet, seven times as much freight was&#13;
moved by road as by rail in 1995 (Annex 1.1). Traffic at the port of Durres recovered to about&#13;
1.0 million tons in 1995 (654,000 tons of conventional traffic plus 334,000 tons of rapidly&#13;
growing ferry traffic), about the same total traffic as in 1992. The number of scheduled airline&#13;
passengers at Rinas Airport has doubled since 1992, reaching 181,358 in 1995 (Annex 1.3).&#13;
Transit traffic is also growing, with 391,468 road vehicles entering and leaving Albania in&#13;
1995 (Annex 1.4).&#13;
1.06  Albania now has 21 passenger cars per 1,000 population, which is less than other&#13;
Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries (e.g., 70 in Romania, 147 in Bulgaria, 169 in&#13;
Poland). The present ownership rate is roughly consistent with other low and lower-middle&#13;
income countries (e.g., 15 in Thailand; 19 each in Bolivia, Egypt and the Philippines; 32 in&#13;
Ecuador). Future car ownership rates are expected to be similar to those of other lower&#13;
income CEE countries because of Albania's location in Europe, the large supply of&#13;
inexpensive used vehicles available in nearby countries, and the rapid development of the&#13;
economy from a low base. In order to catch up, Albania's automobile fleet would have to&#13;
grow at double the rate of gross national product (GNP) during the next several years. This&#13;
kind of growth has been observed in other parts of the world under similar circumstances.&#13;
The Bank forecasts an increase in Albania's GNP of 6 percent per year during 1996-98, so the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
road vehicle fleet is forecast to grow around 12 percent per year during this period, which is&#13;
similar to the growth rates observed during the last two to three years.&#13;
1.07 The Governml1ent has taken a number of steps since 1991 to establish market-based&#13;
policies in the transport sector, with the objective of harmonizing transport regulations with&#13;
those of the European tJnion (EU).  The road vehicle fleet, formerly owned almost&#13;
exclusively by Ministry of Industry, Transport and Trade (MITT) and other ministries, is now&#13;
90 percent privatized (Annex  1.2).  Truck transport and interurban bus transport are&#13;
significantlv dercgulated. Road transport issues which remain to be addressed include vehicle&#13;
overloading, high accident rates caused in part by unsafe vehicles, air pollution caused by&#13;
road vehicle emissions, and insufficient fees charged to transit vehicles to cover road damage.&#13;
Other issues include strengthening the Albanian organization dealing with international&#13;
transport (ANALTIR), further reducing the regulations of interurban bus transport, and&#13;
strengthening MI'l'T to deal with these and other transport issues. Initial advice on these&#13;
matters wvas provided by a transport adviser financed under the Transport Project, Credit&#13;
2499-ALB and this is bcing followed up in part by advisers financed by Holland. A road&#13;
safety progranm and actions on road user charges were initiated under the Transport Project,&#13;
and will be continued under the proposed project. Old trucks of Eastern European origin with&#13;
high axle loads, fuel consumption and pollution are gradually being replaced with newer,&#13;
more cfflicient vehicles. Intraurban buses are owned by the municipalities and subsidized by&#13;
the central government.   Consultants have recommended  clarifying the division of&#13;
responsibilities between central and local governments, reorganizing the Tirana Bus&#13;
Company. coincessioninlg soIIme operations, improving  the remaining  operations, and&#13;
increasing tarifls. MIl"ll is presenitly reviewing these options.&#13;
1.08  in thc port sector. conisultanlts financed under the Transport Project recommended&#13;
establishing an autolnomous port at the main port of Durres. This would entail unifying port&#13;
administratiOnl under civilian control, privatizing remaining port operations and improving&#13;
operational efficiency. 'I'he Government is taking steps to implement these recommendations&#13;
in parallel to preparinig a proposed port project. The Government also investigated the future&#13;
role of the railways under the T'ransport Project. They have reduced railway staff, and are&#13;
presenltlI assessing the level of investment and subsidy that would be required to continue&#13;
freight and passeniger services.  For two years, the Govermment has been discussing&#13;
rehabilitation of' the main airport at Rinas under a build, operate and transfer (BOT)&#13;
arTangement, and a final agreement vwas reached and signed in March 1996 with a German&#13;
Companyi.&#13;
1.09  Investments. The Government invested only around US$6.0 million per annum in&#13;
transport and communications during 1986-90, and virtually no infrastructure maintenance&#13;
was carried out prior to 1994. As a consequence, most transport infrastructure is in poor or&#13;
fair condition, and roads, ports and the Rinas airport in particular are not capable of handling&#13;
the volunme of tral'ffc which is currently offered. The Government has addressed this problem&#13;
by increasing transport investmiients beginning in about 1994, within the limit of its financial&#13;
capacity (see rable 1.1).&#13;

1.10  The Bank has been assisting the Government to prepare a rolling Public Investment&#13;
Plan (PIP) during the last three years. The 1996-98 PIP, currently under preparation, notes&#13;
that substantial increases in public sector investment are required to develop Albania's&#13;
inadequate infrastructure, which is an impediment to economic development. It notes that&#13;
external financing of the PIP is expected to become much more significant, as implementation&#13;
gets under way on the large number of infrastructure projects for which financing has been&#13;
recently secured. The PIP recommends total investments of US$1,191 million during 1996-&#13;
98, of which US$896 million would be financed externally and US$295 million domestically.&#13;
Based on an assessment of sectoral priorities, the PIP recommends that US$303 million (26&#13;
percent) of this amount be allocated to transport during 1996-98. Considering the high&#13;
economic rates of return (ERRs) currently estimated for most transport investments, and the&#13;
fact that the actual pace of investments will be largely determined by the availability of&#13;
concessionary foreign financing, the 1996-98 transport investment program is considered to&#13;
be reasonable and affordable.  In order to help monitor transport investments, the&#13;
Government agreed at negotiations that it shall consult with the Association on its&#13;
national roads investment plan annually, and shall only undertake national roads&#13;
investments greater than equivalent of five million dollars (US$5.0 million) in value that&#13;
have an economic rate of return (ERR) not less than twelve percent (12%), as calculated&#13;
in accordance with a generally accepted methodology.&#13;
C. Previous IDA Involvement in the Transport Sector&#13;
1.11    The first project in Albania, the Critical Imports Project (Credit 2404-ALB, 1992),&#13;
financed port equipment and spare parts, 20 urban buses, and a small amount of railway&#13;
communications equipment as an immediate response to critical needs. The Transport Project&#13;
(Credit 2499-ALB, US$18.0 million IDA, US$8.0 million Kuwait Fund, 1993) seeks to&#13;
accomrnmodate the increase in road traffic, rehabilitate and commercialize the port of Durres, and&#13;
assess the role of the railways. It includes the improvement of 84 km of main roads, equipment&#13;
for the Tirana road maintenance district, repair of quays and port surfaces and provision of&#13;
equipment for the port of Durres, and technical assistance and studies. Project implementation&#13;
to date is satisfactory, with some delays resulting from the transfer of the General Roads&#13;
Directorate (GRD) from MITT to MCT and slow decision making by the Executive Secretariat&#13;
(ES) of the Project Management Unit (PMU). The Government has significantly increased the&#13;
road maintenance budget as agreed under the project. An Albanian/Italian joint venture&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-5-&#13;
(Albinfrastrukture) resulting from the privatization of the state-owned National Roads&#13;
Asphalting Enterprise is working successfully under the project, competitive bidding procedures&#13;
for the procurement of works and equipment are being applied with good results, and all buses&#13;
(except urban lines) and most truck companies have been privatized with the assistance of&#13;
project advisers.&#13;
1.12    The Rural Roads project (Credit 2732-ALB, US$15.0 million IDA, US$15.0 million&#13;
Italy, 1995), became effective on November 8, 1995. The project aims at promoting agricultural&#13;
development by rehabilitating and maintaining rural roads serving agricultural areas, and at&#13;
improving access to economic and social services for rural population centers. It also focuses on&#13;
reducing poverty and increasing employment through the use of labor intensive methods. It&#13;
includes rehabilitation and upgrading of 975 km of rural roads, improvement of rural road&#13;
administration, provision of transport equipment, and a study of the future organization and&#13;
management of the rural roads network. Implementation has started well; US$1.0 million are&#13;
disbursed and US$5.0 million committed, and the Project Implementation Unit (PIU), staffed&#13;
with young and competent Albanians, is acting with dynamism and efficiency. The main lesson&#13;
learned from ongoing projects is the importance of keeping project objectives and composition&#13;
simple so as not to exceed the limited absorptive capacity of Ministry and GRD staff.&#13;
II. ROADS&#13;
A. Network and Traffic&#13;
2.01   The Albanian road network totals about 16,000 km. Of these, 3,221 km comprise the&#13;
main or primary road network, under the administration of GRD  , some 12,000 km are&#13;
secondary and tertiary roads under local administration, and about 1,000 km are urban streets.&#13;
About 47 percent of the main network is paved, 30 percent is gravel and 15 percent is earth&#13;
roads. The condition of the network varies. Primary roads are generally in a poor but stable&#13;
condition, design standards are outdated, construction practices are poor, and the roads have not&#13;
been well maintained. As a result, roughness indexes on the primary network generally range&#13;
between 4 and 10 rn/km (Map IBRD 27625). The secondary and tertiary networks have been&#13;
almost totally neglected for a number of years. The basic structures of these roads are modest&#13;
but usable, and drainage varies widely, in some places requiring only the addition of a few&#13;
culverts, while in others full reconstruction is needed. Rural roads are being improved under the&#13;
Rural Roads Project (para. 1.12).&#13;
2.02  GRD now carries out monthly traffic counts on the main road network. The road&#13;
vehicle fleet has grown rapidly in recent years (para. 1.05). Traffic is now heaviest on the&#13;
main roads linking Tirana to Durres, and Durres to the South (as far as Vlora), with traffic&#13;
levels ranging between 4,500 and 8,300 vehicles per day (see Annex 2.1 and Map IBRD&#13;
27626). Traffic on the main road from Tirana to the North (Montenegrin border) ranges from&#13;
Before April 1, 1996, GRD administered 7,347 km.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6-&#13;
4,000 to 4,500 vpd, while traffic on the main road between Durres and the east (FYR of&#13;
Macedonia) ranges between 2,700 and 3,170 vpd. Traffic counts carried out by consultants&#13;
(for the Rural Roads Project) on 40 sections of secondary and tertiary roads in 1994 ranged&#13;
widely, from 60 vpd to a high of 1,670 vpd (excluding agricultural and animal drawn traffic).&#13;
2.03   Truck loads have increased in recent years, from a typical five tons per single axle in&#13;
the 1980s to ten tons per single axle on paved roads at present (and often 11.5 tons as&#13;
presently authorized by the EU). Significant numbers of heavy, articulated trucks are also in&#13;
use, and these are seen at times on tertiary roads. MITT is currently drafting axle-load&#13;
legislation with the assistance of Dutch advisors as part of a new Highway Code which is&#13;
expected to be proposed to Parliament for approval in 1996. The traffic police will be&#13;
responsible for enforcement of axle load limits, and will be assisted by the provision of&#13;
equipment to be financed under the project.&#13;
B. Administration and Organization&#13;
2.04  The administration of the road network is organized as follows: (i) MCT is in charge&#13;
of the GRD and the seven Regional Road Directorates (RRDs), and is responsible for 3,221&#13;
km (Annex 2.2) of main or primary roads. The seven RRDs are located in Tirana (which also&#13;
runs the central workshop), Diber, Fier, Gjirokaster, Korce, Kukes and Shkoder. (Annex 2.3&#13;
and Charts 2.1 and 2.2); and (ii) the Ministry of Local Government (MLG) oversees the&#13;
municipalities responsible for about 1,000 km of urban streets, and local government&#13;
organizations responsible for the remaining 12,000 km of secondary and tertiary roads&#13;
(including 4,126 km recently separated from GRD). GRD was transferred from MITT to&#13;
MCT in December 1993 (Chart 2.3). The administration of main roads was investigated by&#13;
consultants under the Transport Project and their recommendations served as the basis for the&#13;
recent reorganization of GRD.&#13;
2.05  Road maintenance activities are undertaken by the RRDs with a high degree of&#13;
autonomy. Each RRD has a workshop for regular equipment maintenance, while major&#13;
overhauls are performed at the central workshop in Tirana. RRDs are composed of three to five&#13;
maintenance units, called crews. Each crew is directed by an engineer or technician, and is&#13;
responsible for all routine and winter maintenance. The organizational structure for a typical&#13;
RRD is shown in Chart 2.3. In 1995, the RRDs employed 5,405 persons, including 36&#13;
engineers, 327 technicians (often perforning engineer's functions), 70 administrative staff, and&#13;
4,972 laborers. As of April 1, 1996, GRD's staff will be reduced to about 1,500, while about&#13;
2,000 will be assigned to organizations under the responsibility of MLG (Annex 2.2). The work&#13;
force, all Albanian, is competent in traditional engineering disciplines. However, Albania was&#13;
isolated for more than 40 years, and road personnel require training in modern systems of&#13;
management, operations, economics and enviromnent. Technical assistance and training in&#13;
these areas is being provided under the ongoing Transport Project, and will be continued under&#13;
the proposed project.&#13;
2.06  According to the Law No. 7572 on Local Government of June 10, 1992, the&#13;
responsibility for non-GRD roads lies with the 34 local, elected legislative bodies called district&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
councils, with the possibility to delegate responsibility to a commune or baskia (town) council.&#13;
Although the legal responsibility is clear, the system is not yet implemented. Most of these&#13;
roads were maintained by large state farms or cooperatives until these latter were dissolved.&#13;
Neither the districts nor the communes have sufficient budgetary resources to assume this&#13;
responsibility. In addition, they do not have sufficient technical capacity, and usually the&#13;
commune or baskia approaches the respective RRD for technical advice. The MLG will be&#13;
provided with some of the staff and budgetary resources formerly belonging to GRD as of April&#13;
1, 1996 (Annex 2.2), but this is not likely to be sufficient to maintain the large network for&#13;
which they are responsible. In order to address this issue, the Government will study and&#13;
implement an action plan based on study recommendations to improve the administration and&#13;
maintenance of non-GRD roads by July 31, 1997 under the ongoing Rural Roads Project.&#13;
C. Construction and Maintenance&#13;
2.07  New road construction, rehabilitation and upgrading are presently carried out by a&#13;
variety of organizations. Large works are managed by GRD, while small and medium works&#13;
are under the control of the RRDs. The construction of the first section of the new Tirana-&#13;
Vore (12.0 km) highway is directly administered by a special unit created within GRD. The&#13;
road works under the two ongoing IDA projects are administered by GRD, with project&#13;
coordination provided by two PlUs within MITT (for the Transport Project), and following&#13;
the transfer of GRD, within MCT (for the Rural Roads Project). The MCT PIU will also help&#13;
implement the proposed project.&#13;
2.08  Prior to 1991, construction was done exclusively by three state-owned enterprises: (i)&#13;
the National Road Asphalting Enterprise (NRAE) under the jurisdiction of the predecessor to&#13;
MITT; (ii) the National Bridge Construction Enterprise, and (iii) the Highway and Road&#13;
Construction Enterprise under the jurisdiction of the then MOC (now MCT). The three&#13;
enterprises have been commercialized, and are in an advanced status of privatization. NRAE&#13;
has formed a joint venture (Albinfrastrukture) with an experienced foreign construction firm.&#13;
A small-scale private construction industry has also appeared, already with some management&#13;
and contracting skills, mostly in private building construction. While experience in road&#13;
construction in the emerging private sector is limited, many of their key staff have extensive&#13;
experience in road works from their former employment in the public sector. In addition, a&#13;
significant number of Albanians have practical construction experience from working in other&#13;
countries, mainly Italy and Greece. Moreover, through the ongoing road projects in Albania,&#13;
local companies are learning to manage road construction. For example, Albinfrastrukture,&#13;
thanks to its joint-venture status, is taking part in the Transport Project and would be able to&#13;
compete for some contracts within the proposed project.&#13;
2.09  The RRDs execute all the maintenance works on the main road network. Maintenance&#13;
works are undertaken by crews which are each responsible for 30 to 50 km of road. The&#13;
crews' headmen have long experience and are skilled in the definition and supervision of road&#13;
maintenance, which is generally labor intensive. RRDs' maintenance equipment, e.g. trucks,&#13;
compactors and asphalt mixing plants, is mostly very old and largely unusable, and the&#13;
ongoing Transport Project is financing new equipment for the central workshop of the Tirana&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
RRD. Additional maintenance equipment for other RRDs is being financed under the Rural&#13;
Roads Project, while US$4.0 million, excluding contingencies, would be provided for this&#13;
purpose under the proposed project.&#13;
2.10 While many of GRD's roads are continuously maintained, the quality of work is not&#13;
always satisfactory and work efficiency is low, mainly because of lack of equipment (e.g., for&#13;
compacting) or of proper supervision. Bituminous roads are repaired with asphalt concrete,&#13;
penetration macadam or low quality natural bituminous sand. Major repairs are done using&#13;
asphalt concrete prepared at a private asphalt batching plant, but no more plants are in working&#13;
order. Bituminous sand is frequently used to fill potholes, but compaction is left to the traffic,&#13;
which is unsatisfactory. Repair of gravel roads is done sometimes with river gravel but mainly&#13;
with crushed gravel, which often is transported over long distances. Grading is generally done&#13;
manually, and compaction is left to the traffic. In the lowest level roads, significant problem&#13;
arises because of the standard design of stone-pitched roads. Poor bonding between the stone&#13;
base and the gravel surface results in the gravel being quickly lost, especially when placed&#13;
without compacting. This problem is addressed in the Rural Roads Project with the assistance&#13;
of advisors. Periodic maintenance, e.g., road strengthening and resurfacing, is presently&#13;
carried out by foreign contractors or local/foreign joint ventures under competitive bidding&#13;
procedures. It is expected that a significant volume of routine maintenance will continue to be&#13;
carried out by force account for some time because the works are less defined, less appealing&#13;
to large contractors, there is little purely local contracting capacity, and the works need to be&#13;
carried out on a continuous rather than periodic basis. A step by step approach to privatizing&#13;
additional maintenance activities is required.(para 3.08). Technical assistance provided under&#13;
the Transport Project will be continued under the proposed project to assist in implementing&#13;
this plan.&#13;
D. Planning and Supervision&#13;
2.11    The MCT, through GRD, is responsible for planning the main road network, subject to&#13;
approval by the Ministry of Finance (MOF) and Parliament. GRD prepares most engineering&#13;
design work with the collaboration of the Institute for Studies and Projects No. 2, which recently&#13;
has been commercialized and partly (60 percent) privatized. Lately, engineering and economics&#13;
staff are leaving the government to become private engineering consultants, mostly on an&#13;
individual basis. Road designs follow those applied in Italy, and are appropriate to forecast&#13;
traffic flows and physical characteristics (Annex 2.4).&#13;
2.12   Road works were formerly supervised by the state enterprise that implemented them.&#13;
There are currently eight engineering companies registered with GRD to provide design and&#13;
supervision services. Of these eight companies, seven are small independent consultants,&#13;
consisting of one to two engineers and employing additional staff for specific projects. The&#13;
Institute No. 2, operating under the new name ICP (Infrastructure Consulting Projects), also&#13;
provides supervision and consulting services. Three laboratories currently provide test services:&#13;
(i) the Institute for Construction Technology, mainly for construction materials; (ii) the Hydro-&#13;
Geotechnical Institute for earthworks and road base materials; and (iii) the Technical University&#13;
of Tirana, for a limited number of tests.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
E. Expenditures and Financing&#13;
2.13 Expenditures: Road expenditures averaged about US$10.0 million per annum during&#13;
the 1980s, based on the official exchange rate, which must be interpreted with caution because&#13;
of distortions in statistics and the economy. About 70 percent of this amount was spent on&#13;
GRD roads, and 30 percent on the balance of the network. Around US$6.5 million of the total&#13;
amount was spent on maintenance with the objective of keeping the roads passable at&#13;
minimum cost. Maintenance expenditures then fell in the late 1980s and early 1990s due to&#13;
budgetary constraints, reaching a low of US$3.2 million in 1992. The GOA then increased its&#13;
maintenance expenditures above the level agreed under the Transport Project, spending about&#13;
US$8.0 million per annum in 1994 and 1995, and budgeting the same amount in 1996, which&#13;
is adequate as discussed below (para 2.22). GRD proposes to retain 75 percent of its 1996&#13;
budget after April 1, 1996, and to allocate the balance to local roads through the MLG,&#13;
following the reduction of its network to 3,221 km (para 2.01 and Annex 2.2).&#13;
2.14 Almost all of GRD's paved road network (about 2,500 km, Annex 2.2) is in poor or fair&#13;
condition (para. 2.01 and Map 27800). Rehabilitation of almost all of these roads is likely to&#13;
be economically justified, considering that most carry over 2,000 vpd (Map IBRD 27626),&#13;
traffic is growing rapidly and axle loads are increasing. This would require an investment of&#13;
some US$250.0 million (about $100,000/km).  In addition, some paved roads require&#13;
investments to strengthen them or increase their capacity (town bypasses, climbing lanes,&#13;
some four-lane construction), some local roads need to be improved, and all roads need to be&#13;
maintained. Many other countries spend around one percent of their GNP on their road&#13;
networks, while some spend two percent. Considering Albania's substantial needs, and that&#13;
most roads investment will be done with concessionary financing, it is reasonable for Albania&#13;
to spend perhaps 2.5 percent of GNP on their road network during the next several years&#13;
(about US$58.0 million in 1996). This would permit them to carry out one cycle of&#13;
rehabilitation on GRD's paved roads in 10 years, budget US$8.0 million per annum for road&#13;
maintenance and spend US$24.0 million per annum on other road improvements. The&#13;
Government increased its road expenditures significantly, from US$7.7 million in 1994 to&#13;
US$19.3 million in 1995 (Table 1.1 and Annex 2.5). GOA also expects to invest US$42.8&#13;
million in roads in 1996, subject to the timely availability of foreign financing, which is&#13;
consistent with this approach.&#13;
2.15 Financing: All road expenditures are financed from the budget. The RRDs prepare&#13;
requests for road funds, which are assembled and vetted by GRD, and a combined road budget&#13;
is then submitted by GRD through MCT to Parliament for approval (Chart 2.4). Following&#13;
adoption of the Government budget, Ministry of Finance (MOF) sends funds for most RRDs&#13;
through a District Authority Bank. In the case of non-GRD roads, municipalities, baskias&#13;
and communes presently receive funds which are budgeted through MLG.&#13;
2.16 The GOA collects revenues from road users in the form of fuel taxes, taxes on foreign&#13;
road users, vehicle registration/control fees and vehicle import duties.  Road fuel was&#13;
significantly subsidized until 1992. The GOA then increased the retail price of gasoline and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
diesel fuel to prices at or above the amounts agreed under the Transport Project (US$0.45/1&#13;
including taxes for 85-95 octane gasoline and diesel fuel):&#13;

2.17 The GOA also collects customs duties, production taxes, and a road tax on road fuel as&#13;
follows:&#13;

It is estimated, based on the size and utilization of the vehicle fleet, that the Government&#13;
collected around US$153 million in fuel taxes in 1995, including US$53 million from the&#13;
"Road Tax" (Annex 2.6). All fuel taxes are treated by the GOA as sources of general revenue,&#13;
including the "Road Tax".&#13;
2.18   Foreign road users crossing Albania are taxed as follows: trucks US$0.02/t-km, buses&#13;
$0.002/p-km, and cars US$1/day. In 1995, US$2.2 million was collected from foreign road&#13;
users. The GOA also collected US$2.14 million in vehicle registration/control fees in 1995,&#13;
based on the following rates:&#13;

Trailer                    100&#13;
2.19 The GOA also collects an estimated US$44.7 million in vehicle import duties in 1995,&#13;
based on the following rates:&#13;
(i) duties on new vehicles: 40 percent of CIF price for cars and vans, 25 percent for&#13;
buses, and 7 percent for trucks.&#13;
(ii) duties on second-hand vehicles: US$1,500 on cars, US$3,000 on vans and&#13;
buses weighing less than three tons, US$5,000 on buses and trucks over three&#13;
tons.&#13;
Import duties are not strictly a road tax since duties are collected on most other imports as&#13;
well.&#13;
2.20 System of Road User Charges: Economic efficiency is maximized when road user&#13;
charges cover road maintenance and investment expenditures, and each vehicle class covers at&#13;
least its variable road costs, as explained in Annex 2.6. Albania's levenues from road user&#13;
charges are compared with the optimum level of road maintenance expenditures plus&#13;
investment expenditures, using the Bank's HDM III model, in Annex 2.6. The optimum&#13;
maintenance expenditure is that which minimizes the discounted sum of road costs and&#13;
vehicle operating costs. Separate estimates are made for each vehicle class and road surface,&#13;
for the main rural (GRD) network, local rural network and urban streets.&#13;
2.21   There are three conditions which must be taken into account in assessing the system of&#13;
road user charges in Albania. First, the Government, following the transition, uses the fuel&#13;
tax as a major source of general revenue because it is easy to collect, impacts the wealthy&#13;
more than the poor, and because this is common practice in most European countries. The&#13;
retail price of normal gasoline in Albania (US$0.70-75/1, Table 2.2) ranks 24th among 35&#13;
representative European countries, while diesel fuel (US$0.40-45/1) ranks 25th. Second. the&#13;
road network is mostly in poor or fair condition (para. 2.01), requiring rehabilitation before it&#13;
is capable of being maintained (particularly periodic maintenance). The HDM III model, on&#13;
the other hand, assumes that the road network is in sufficiently good condition that it can be&#13;
maintained through normal maintenance procedures. Third, a significant part of the local&#13;
rural road network was built for farm cooperatives which have since disappeared, or for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-12-&#13;
military purposes. Many of these roads are little used at present, are not maintained, and may&#13;
well be abandoned in the future. Under these circumstances, the model is most useful in&#13;
indicating the funds which will be needed to maintain the main rural network (and urban&#13;
network) after most roads have been rehabilitated, which will take a number of years. The&#13;
model is also useful in pointing out the importance of reducing the local road network to a&#13;
size which Albania can reasonably afford to maintain.&#13;
2.22  It is estimated that GRD should spend about US$9.0 million per annum to maintain its&#13;
main rural road network (page I of Attachment to Annex 2.6). This compares with US$6.5&#13;
million per annum which they spend at present (para. 2.13). Considering that more than half&#13;
the maintenance budget whould be spent on periodic maintenance that currently cannot be&#13;
carried out, the ongoing rehabilitation program that is being implemented with concessionary&#13;
financing, and the low efficiency of present maintenance activities, the present GRD budget&#13;
(US$1 ,800/km) is considered to be satisfactory until most roads are rehabilitated and&#13;
equipment is replaced. Following this, it should be increased to the recommen ded level&#13;
(US$2,500/km). The GOA agreed at negotiations that it will: (a) beginning January 1,&#13;
1997, provide equivalent of six million dallars (US$6.0 million) on an annual basis to&#13;
GRD for road maintenance; (b) beginning January 1, 1998, provide adequate road&#13;
maintenance budget for secondary and tertiary roads, (c) allocate road funds first to&#13;
maintenance and thereafter to other road expenditures, and (d) consult annually with&#13;
the Association concerning its road maintenance budget.&#13;
2.23  It is also estimated that about US$3.3 million per annum should be spent to maintain&#13;
the urban road network and about US$20.7 million per annum to maintain the local rural road&#13;
network (page I of Attachment to Annex 2.6). Almost no funds were budgetci for this&#13;
purpose in recent years, and these amounts appear to be beyond Albania's budgetary&#13;
possibilities. This emphasizes the importance of reducing the size of the local rural road&#13;
network to what Albania can reasonably afford to maintain in the future.&#13;
2.24  Present fuel taxes and registration fees cover the optimum level of road expenditures&#13;
(including those recommended for the present non-GRD network) if just the "road tax" is&#13;
taken into account, and exceeds it by a factor of three if all fuel taxes are taken into account&#13;
(page 4 of Attachment to Annex 2.6). The aggregate level of taxes on road users is thus more&#13;
than adequate. In addition, the current high level of taxation does not appear to adversely&#13;
affect the road transport sector, given recent high traffic growth rates (para. 1.05). Each&#13;
vehicle class is also estimated to cover its variable road costs even if only the "road tax" is&#13;
taken into account (page 4 of Attachment to Annex 2.6). The degree of coverage varies&#13;
widely, from a low of 1.6:1 in the case of articulated trucks, to 4-7:1 for the light vehicle&#13;
classes, to a high of 10:1 for buses.&#13;
2.25 The GOA will carry out an Organization and Management Study (OMS) under the&#13;
ongoing Rural Roads Project, and implement an Action Plan to improve the administration&#13;
and maintenance of non-GRD roads. This task has taken an increased importance because of&#13;
the recent separation of additional roads from GRD (para 2.01) and the need to reduce the size&#13;
of the road network to be maintained (para. 2.23). The terms of reference for the OMS were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-13-&#13;
revised to take these factors into account and agreed at negotiations. The GOA agreed at&#13;
negotiations to (i) not later than July 1, 1997, complete an Action Plan, and carry out&#13;
such a Plan to improve the maintenance and administration on non-GRD roads; and (ii)&#13;
provide an adequate maintenance budget for non-GRD roads from 1998 onwards&#13;
(Annex 2.7).&#13;
F. Road Safety&#13;
2.26 Road safety is a serious problem, with the number of reported traffic fatalities&#13;
increasing from 145 in 1990 to 411 in 1994. and then declining to 306 in 1995 (Annex 2.8).&#13;
The 1995 fatality rate is by far the highest in Europe, amounting to 2,782 deaths per million&#13;
vehicles in 1995 compared to 377 deaths per million vehicles in the European Union (EU) and&#13;
an average of 909 in six Central and Eastern European countries in 1992. Reducing road&#13;
accidents requires a multidisciplinary approach, including identifying and correcting unsafe&#13;
places on the roads (black spots), introducing and enforcing a vehicle inspection system,&#13;
preventing drunk driving, improving the enforcement of traffic regulations, improving access&#13;
to medical help, and education and publicity campaigns. The GOA is aware of this issue, and&#13;
has already taken some steps to improve safety, resulting in a 24 percent reduction in fatalities&#13;
from 1994 to 1995.  The police report that they have stepped up their enforcement of traflic&#13;
regulations. New drivers are gaining experience. A pilot vehicle inspection center has been&#13;
established in Tirana withEuropean Union (Phare) financing, and additional centers are&#13;
planned. A road safety adviser is being provided, and safety considerations were taken into&#13;
account in planning road improvements under the Transport Project. A Highway Code based&#13;
on Italian standards is expected to be submitted to Parliament for approval in mid.-1996. The&#13;
code establishes safety standards for vehicles and roads, driving regulations and police&#13;
controls procedures. The proposed project provides for the continuation of the road safety&#13;
program, including road improvements, safety equipment for the police and technical&#13;
assistance as described in Chapter 3.&#13;
G. Environmental Aspects&#13;
2.27 The Government of Albania is making rapid progress over the last couple of years in&#13;
establishing a national environmental policy framework and strategy.   The National&#13;
Environmental Action Plan was prepared with assistance from the World Bank in 1993 and&#13;
adopted by the Government in January of 1994.  On the basis of the NEAP, several&#13;
environmental projects and programs are now being undertaken in Albania with assistance of&#13;
international institutions such as the European Union (Phare) Program, UNDP and World Bank&#13;
executed Mediterranean Environmental Technical Assistance Program (METAP). Despite the&#13;
rapid progress, the country is far from an efficient system of environmental management and&#13;
sustainable development. There is a lack of institutional capacity, the legal framework suffers&#13;
major gaps and the enforcement systems are still very weak. The proposed National Roads&#13;
Project consisting of major rehabilitation works provides an opportunity for the Governmnent of&#13;
Albania to integrate environmental concerns into the design and implementation stages of the&#13;
project in order to make the project both, socially and environmentally sustainable. Steps in this&#13;
direction are already being taken by GOA in the road sector, as for example, policy decisions to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-14-&#13;
promote the use of unleaded gasoline by providing price incentives to reduce the effects of&#13;
vehicular pollution, and the establishment of ten vehicle inspection centers.&#13;
III. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Setup and Objectives&#13;
3.01 Setup. Strong growth in road transport in Albania (registered vehicles increased more&#13;
than sixfold during the last five years. Annex 1.2, para 1.05), and a deficient institutional,&#13;
managerial and budgetary response to this growth have created key infrastructure bottlenecks.&#13;
This situation has increased road deterioration and restricts ongoing development. Even&#13;
more, traffic accidents are now a serious problem, and environmental issues may become an&#13;
additional problem if not anticipated in time (para 2.26 and 2.27) because of the fleet&#13;
expansion and the upgrading works required on the infrastructure. To overcome these&#13;
impediments to a sustainable and systematic development, the National Roads Project (the&#13;
project) has been established.&#13;
3.02 The project will foster a national institutional and managerial improvement of the road&#13;
sector. It will also continue and complement the ongoing physical improvements under the&#13;
IDA's Transport and Rural Roads projects (paras. 1.11 and 1.12), and the planned partial&#13;
rehabilitation of the East-West Corridor from Durres to Elbasan, (81.0 km), financed&#13;
byEuropean Union (Phare) and the European Investment Bank (EIB). The East-West&#13;
Corridor (Durres-Qafe Thane, at the Macedonian border, 152.1 km) is part of the Trans&#13;
European Network Corridor Nr.8 and, subsequently is eligible for financing by institutions of&#13;
the European Union. Its first partial rehabilitation (upgrading of eight bridges east of Librazhd&#13;
under the Transport Project) will be completed in early summer 1996, and complemented by&#13;
the EIB/PHARE financing and the proposed project.&#13;
3.03  Objectives.   The project supports the Country Assistance Strategy for Albania&#13;
(reviewed by the Board on March 8, 1994) by rehabilitating and expanding the transport&#13;
system, which has deteriorated to the point where it constitutes a major impediment to private&#13;
sector development, as well as to foreign direct investment. The main objectives of the project&#13;
are to:&#13;
(i)    accomodate expected traffic growth by rehabilitating and constructing&#13;
national roads;&#13;
(ii)   improve the maintenance and safety of national roads;&#13;
(iii)   promote the development of the local contracting and consulting industries;&#13;
and&#13;
(iv)   train GRD's staff and develop strong cooperation between GRD's staff&#13;
and activities and the University of Tirana (UT).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-15-&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
3.04  The proposed project is based on the main priority needs established by GRD's 1996-&#13;
1998 Public Investment Plan (PIP).  Specifically, the project includes the following&#13;
components: (i) civil works on about 90 km of national roads in the East-West and Northern&#13;
corridors (US$45.0 million, excluding contingencies);  (ii) provision of equipment and&#13;
materials for road maintenance, road safety and signalization (US$7.0 million);  (iii)&#13;
supervision of road works (US$1.4 million); (iv) establishment of a road data bank, a&#13;
pavement management system. and a bridge management system (US$2.0 million); and (v)&#13;
employment of consultants for TA and training on project coordination, continuation of the&#13;
ongoing road safety program, project implementation, management and modem engineering&#13;
techniques, including collaboration with the University of Tirana's Faculty of Civil Works&#13;
(US$2.3 million).&#13;
3.05   Rehabilitation and Construction of National Roads. This component includes 90.1&#13;
km of road works, divided into five sections covered by separate contracts, together with a&#13;
sixth contract for two important new bridges over the Matit and Drin rivers. The required&#13;
feasibility studies, engineering designs, and donor financing for these works are already&#13;
available, with some completion work still required for the East-West Corridor (para 3.15)&#13;
expected by May 6. 1996. The design standards (i.e. the standard cross sections) of the five&#13;
road sections and two bridgs are satisfactory, and are shown in Annex 3.1. The works are&#13;
located in two of the three main road corridors of Albania. Three consecutive sections are in&#13;
the East-West Corridor, which links Albania to the Former Yugoslav Republic (FYR) of&#13;
Macedonia and to Greece. and which also links the main port and second most populous city&#13;
of Durres to the capital, Tirana. Two nonconsecutive sections plus the two bridges are in the&#13;
Northern Corridor, which starts in Tirana. and leads to the northwestern region of tihe country,&#13;
where the important cities of Lezha and Shkoder are located. It also connects Albania to&#13;
Montenegro and Serbia, and this corridor is the only road link between Albania and Central&#13;
and Northern Europe. All these roads are in poor condition and are overloaded where they&#13;
pass through towns.&#13;
3.06  The road works planned for the East-West Corridor total 71.1 km in length; traffic&#13;
volume on this part of the road network varies from 2,200 to 3,170 vpd. and high propc;rtion&#13;
of this traffic (30 to 35 percent) is heavy, international vehicles. An important goal of the&#13;
works in these sections is to improve the drainage system, which will require reconstruction&#13;
of drainage structures including bridges. Also, road alignment will have to be upgraded to&#13;
modern standards. Like the rest of the road works in the project, the variable structure of&#13;
existing pavements will be strengthened to support modem traffic loads (11.5 tons per single&#13;
axle in the EU) and they will be topped with a 5 cm asphalt concrete wearing course. All&#13;
ongoing works (para 3.02) are obviously excluded from project works described here:&#13;
(i) Elbasan-Librazhd (30.5 kim). This section will be upgraded to a 7.5 m&#13;
carriageway with a 5 cm asphalted concrete wearing course and two 1.5 m&#13;
gravel shoulders (Annex 3. 1, page 1). The gravel bypass of Elbasan, Albania's&#13;
main metallurgical center, which is hardly usable at present, will be also&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
asphalted.&#13;
(ii) Librazhd-Qukes (21.0 km). A similar carriageway upgrade (Annex 3.1,&#13;
page 1) will be done on this section, together with the construction of a new&#13;
bypass for the city of Librazhd to be put in on government-owned land.&#13;
(iii) Qukes-Qafe Thane (19.6 km). This mountainous section will require upgrade&#13;
to a 7.0 m asphalted carriageway with a 4 cm asphalted concrete wearing&#13;
course and two 1.0 m gravel shoulders (Annex 3. 1, page 2), and new con-&#13;
struction will be needed on section totalling 3.2 km to create climbing lanes&#13;
for heavy vehicles on gradients steeper than 7 percent.&#13;
3.07 The road works planned for the Northern Corridor total 19.0 km in length:&#13;
(i) Tapize-Fushe Kruja (7.0 km). The road between Tirana and Fushe Kruja is&#13;
already being upgraded under the Transport Project, but this 7.0 km section&#13;
was not included in those works. Traffic volume on this section is 4,500 vpd,&#13;
with 30 percent heavy vehicles. Works to be carried out under this project will&#13;
be the asphalting of its 7.5 m carriageway and improvement of the two 1.5 m&#13;
wide gravel shoulders (Annex 3. 1, page 3).&#13;
(ii) Miloti-Lezha (12.0 km). Works are already underway under the Transport&#13;
Project to connect Fushe Kruja to Miloti; this section of new road construction&#13;
will complete the route from Tirana (through Fushe Kruja) to Lezha. Traffic&#13;
volume on this route is 4,500 vpd with 20 percent heavy vehicles(Annex 3. 1,&#13;
page 4). This new route will be 6.1 km shorter than the existing route.&#13;
(iii) Bridges over the Drin and Matit rivers. In order to complete the new route&#13;
between Miloti and Lezha, two rivers must be crossed: a 650.0 m bridge will&#13;
be built over the Matit river at km 1+357, and a 200.0 m bridge will be built&#13;
over the Drin river at km 10+300. Both bridges are designed to be on piled&#13;
foundations over solid gravel soil and the girders (most of which will be the&#13;
20.0 m standard lenght) and the deck slabs will be prefabricated (Annex 3. 1,&#13;
page 4). The structures are designed to withstand earthquake shocks up to 7&#13;
on the Richter scale, consistent with the seismic characteristics of the area.&#13;
3.08  Road Maintenance and Safety Equipment and Materials. Road maintenance&#13;
equipment is already being provided to the central workshop of the Tirana RRD under the&#13;
Transport Project. The other six RRDs still have only a few old, and mostly obsolete, pieces&#13;
of equipment. They would be furnished with new, basic road maintenance equipment&#13;
(US$4.0 million, excluding contingencies) under the project. This equipment would allow&#13;
RRDs to achieve sound maintenance with modern equipment and technology. Particularly&#13;
important is the establishment of a radio communication system for nationwide coordination&#13;
of the maintenance system and permanent contact with GRD's headquarters at Tirana.&#13;
Acquisition of the equipment would not interfere with the pilot contracting program (about 20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-17-&#13;
percent of road maintenance needs) of the Transport Project, which will be continucd under&#13;
the proposed project. A list of maintenance equipment to be acquired and related estimated&#13;
costs are shown in Annex 3.2.&#13;
3.09  Urgently needed improvement of road safety would be achieved through acquisition of&#13;
specific equipment, such as speed control radars, alcoholimeters and vehicles for the National&#13;
Traffic Police (US$1.9 million, excluding contingencies), and vertical and horizontal&#13;
signalization equipment and materials (US$1.1 million, excluding contingencies) for the&#13;
GRD. A list of the safety and signalization equipment and materials to be acquired, and&#13;
related estimated costs, are shown in Annex 3.3.&#13;
3.10  Supervision of Road Works. Given the significant investment involved in the six&#13;
road contracts (US$45.0 million, excluding contingencies) and the increasing but still limited&#13;
experience of GRD staff and local consultants in supervision, an international consulting team&#13;
will be hired (US$1.4 million) for supervision of works. The team will be seconded by&#13;
competent GRD staff designated for every contract. The consultant team will include, at&#13;
minimum, a Resident Team Leader (Highway Engineer with experience on conventional&#13;
bridges), a Materials Engineer and an Inspector/Surveyor for 96 man-months (m/m). The&#13;
main tasks of the team would include:&#13;
D define contract packages&#13;
- review prequalification and bidding documents&#13;
* advise on evaluating prequalifications, bids and on contract negotiations&#13;
* review, and if necessary change, designs and confirm traffic on roads to be&#13;
improved&#13;
* prepare construction drawings with the contractors&#13;
* supervise construction works, including quality control, cost control,&#13;
measurement and progress control&#13;
* assist contractors in preparing bills and certifications of bills, if necessary&#13;
* report to the PIU within the GRD&#13;
Further details are contained in the terms of reference (TOR) for the above supervision&#13;
services (Annex 3.4). Hiring of the international consultants team of supervisors will be&#13;
a condition of Credit effectiveness.&#13;
3.11   Establishment of a Road Data Bank, a Pavement Management System and a&#13;
Bridge Management System. These three important institutional operational systems for&#13;
road administration, management and budgeting will be introduced for the first time in&#13;
Albania under the project. They are essential to achieving any satisfactory maintenance and&#13;
improvement plan for the national road network (NRN) and all subsequent action. They&#13;
would be established and implemented by GRD staff under the advice and coordination of&#13;
three teams of international consultants. The road data bank (RDB; US$0.5 million excluding&#13;
contingencies, 32 m/m) will be a general information system for GRD, producing systematic&#13;
and timely statistics on the NRN and traffic conditions, and will be used for the daily&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
administration of the NRN, as a planning tool and as a source of basic data for the pavement&#13;
management system (PMS) and the bridge management system (BMS). The PMS (US$1.0&#13;
million, 66 m/m) will be a systematic approach to planning and budgeting of NRN's&#13;
maintenance and, specifically, for pavement maintenance and rehabilitation.  The BMS&#13;
(US$0.5 million, 31 m/m) will be a systematic approach to bridge maintenance and&#13;
reconstruction, and would be introduced, as the PMS, a year after the RDB, when most of the&#13;
RDB's data would become available. Details on the rationale and description of the three&#13;
systems are provided in the respective TORs for the selection of each preparation team in&#13;
Annex 3.5 (Road Data Bank), Annex 3.6 (Pavement Management System), and Annex 3.7&#13;
(Bridge Management System).&#13;
3.12  Project Coordinator.  Successful implementation of the project requires strong&#13;
leadership based on a deep understanding of the issues involved. It includes numerous works&#13;
sites and contractors and consultants, and difficult questions of road management and&#13;
administration, traffic safety and environmental issues. Consequently, a deep and consistent&#13;
coordination among all project components is essential. A Project Coordinator (US$0.8&#13;
million excluding contingencies, 54 m/m) with experience in contract management and&#13;
procurement will provide a single channel of coordination for the project, ensuring that an up-&#13;
to-date focus of knowledge and management experience is available for appropriate planning,&#13;
financial monitoring, satisfactory progress of works and progress reporting to the&#13;
Government, IDA and other project donors. During a six-month inception period (July-&#13;
December 1996), following scheduled approval of the project in June 1996, the Project&#13;
Coordinator will prepare and coordinate the physical implementation of the project (scheduled&#13;
to start in January 1997), focusing on the prequalification and bidding processes for road&#13;
works contractors. Details of Project Coordinator activities are provided in the TOR, Annex&#13;
3.8. Appointment of the Project Coordinator is a condition of Credit effectiveness.&#13;
3.13  Technical Assistance (TA) and Training. Besides the technical assistance provided&#13;
in para 3.10 through 3.12 above, an important and extensive program of TA (US$0.5 million&#13;
excluding contingencies, 28 m/m), and of training (US$1.0 million, 340 m/m of GRD staff) is&#13;
required for the GRD's and the RRDs' executive staff in order to manage the organizational&#13;
adjustments required by the project and the modernization of the road sector. The main tasks&#13;
of the program are to assist and train:&#13;
* GRD, in improving its capability in project management, planning, monitoring,&#13;
budgeting and accounting&#13;
* GRD and RRDs, in strengthening their skills on road safety and environmental&#13;
issues for planning, managing and supervising road projects&#13;
* RRDs' technicians and road workers. in improving their proficiency in vehicle&#13;
and equipment repair, and on maintenance of road works&#13;
* RRDs, in designing and implementing a maintenance plan and management&#13;
systems&#13;
* local consultants and local contractors (mainly acting as subcontractors),&#13;
in supervision, contract management and business management (administration,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-19-&#13;
cost calculation and control, quality assurance)&#13;
GRD in establishing bilateral relations (including twinning) between its staff&#13;
and activities, and other road related institutions such as UT.&#13;
The TA and training program would be developed by teams of international consultants.&#13;
Details of activities are provided in the TOR for the selection of consultants, Annex 3.9.&#13;
C. Relation to Other Projects in the Sector&#13;
3.14   Other World Bank Group projects with road sector components are also operating in&#13;
Albania. namely the:  (a) Rural Poverty Alleviation project (RPAP);  (b) Irrigation&#13;
Rehabilitation project (IRP); (c) International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD)&#13;
projects; (d) Rural Roads project (Credit 2732-ALB); and (e) Transport Project (Credit 2499-&#13;
ALB). The RPAP and IFAD projects have objectives more directed to immediate social&#13;
support and their roads programs are focused on small tertiary (local) roads within communes,&#13;
as is the IRP, effective since November 1994, which is financing some machinery for access&#13;
roads and equipment for irrigation works. The Rural Roads project's main target is the&#13;
rehabilitation and maintenance of rural roads. Since these projects operate entirely on the&#13;
secondary and tertiary road networks, no special coordination with the National Roads Project&#13;
is required. Concerning the coordination with the Transport Project, the proposed National&#13;
Roads Project is a continuation of the rehabilitation process on the East-West and Northern&#13;
Corridors. No specific coordination is required, except for the uniformity of geometric&#13;
designs and signalling.&#13;

Costs of road maintenance and safety equipment and materials (US$7.0 million) are based on&#13;
the latest and most recent acquisitions under the Transport Project, and in similar deliveries in&#13;
the region. Supervision of civil works would require 96 m/m of international consultants at&#13;
US$14,500 per m/m equivalent, amounting to a reasonable and usual 3.1 percent of&#13;
construction cost or US$1.4 million. The TA by consultants for the road data bank (32 rn/m;&#13;
US$0.5 million), pavement management system (66 m/m; US$1.0 million) and bridge&#13;
management system (31 m/rn; US$0.5 million) have been estimated on the basis of&#13;
US$16,000 per m/m in consonance with comparable services being provided in the region.&#13;
The 54 m/m manpower required for the important job of Project Coordinator have been&#13;
calculated at the usual rate of US$15,000 per m/m (total US$0.8 million) for experts with&#13;
similar competence and experience. The TA and training program for GRD and RRD&#13;
executive staff (28 m/m of consultants for US$500,000; and 340 m/m of GRD staff training&#13;
for US$1,000,000) have been calculated based on the price of US$16,000 per r/m  for&#13;
consultants and US$3,100 per rn/m for training, as is being presently incurred in Albanian&#13;
projects. The time-based rate for consultants, i.e., the man-month, includes salary, social&#13;
costs, firm's overhead, travel costs, fee or profit, and overseas allowance. Costs for training&#13;
of GRD staff take into account that the most expensive item in international training, travel,&#13;
would mostly take place inside Europe, and would be relatively inexpensive. All technical&#13;
assistance, training and related materials and equipment are exempted from taxes and duties.&#13;
3.18  A physical contingency of 10 percent has been included for all components, to cover&#13;
for a possible increase in quantities. This amount is appropriate given the precise engineering&#13;
designs already available for the road works. Price contingencies have been applied to base&#13;
cost plus physical contingencies, expressed in US$, in accordance with Bank guidelines, for&#13;
each year mid-1996 through end-2000, as follows: 3.3, 2.3, 2.5, 2.5, and 2.5 percent.&#13;
F. Project Financing&#13;
3.19  The borrower would be the Republic of Albania. The Association would provide a&#13;
credit of SDR17.4 million or US$25.0 million equivalent (37.9 percent of total project cost&#13;
including contingencies). The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD),&#13;
would provide a US$12.0 million equivalent loan (18.2 percent of total project cost) on a&#13;
parallel financing basis for the Elbasan-Librazhd, (30.5 km) road works in the East-West&#13;
Corridor, and also would provide part of the supervision. Similarly, the Kuwait Fund (KF),&#13;
would provide a US$8.0 million equivalent loan (12.1 percent of total project cost) on a&#13;
parallel financing basis for the Qukes-Qafe Thane, (19.6 km) road works in the East-West&#13;
Corridor, and also would provide part of the supervision. The Government of Italy, on a&#13;
parallel financing basis, would provide an ITL 14.5 billion or US$9.0 million equivalent loan&#13;
(13.6 percent of the total project cost) for the financing of the Tapize-Fushe Kruje (7.0 km)&#13;
road works, and construction of two bridges spanning the Matit river (650 m long). and the&#13;
Drin river (200 m long), on the Miloti-Lezha road on the Northern Corridor. The Government&#13;
of Albania would contribute US$5.0 million equivalent, a contribution slightly below the&#13;
maximum 10 percent of total cost considered as the limit of its budgetary possibilities. It is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-22-&#13;
expected that the US$7.0 million financing gap (10.6 percent of total project cost) for the&#13;
financing of an important share of TA, training and equipment, would be covered by a grant&#13;
from European Union (Phare). The Government confirmed at negotiations that it would&#13;
meet these US$5.0 million local costs as well as, if the case arises, any cost overruns. The&#13;
Government also confirmed at negotiations the financing arrangements with EBRD, KF,&#13;
Italy and European Union (Phare). A financing plan, based on the above assumptions, and&#13;
confirmed with the Government at negotiations, is shown in Table 3.3 below.&#13;

G. Implementation and Monitoring&#13;
3.20  The proposed IDA Credit of SDRI7.4 million (US$25.0 million equivalent), the&#13;
EBRD loan of US$12.0 million equivalent, the KF loan of US$8.0 million equivalent, the&#13;
Italian Government loan of ITL14.5 billion or US$9.0 million equivalent, and the (potential)&#13;
European Union (Phare) grant of US$7.0 million equivalent (para.3.19) would be made to the&#13;
Government of the Republic of Albania. The General Road Directorate in the Ministry of&#13;
Construction and Tourism will be responsible for the overall implementation of the project&#13;
through a five-member Project Implementation Unit (PIU) already established in GRD under&#13;
the chairmanship of H.E. the Minister of Construction and Tourism (Chart 2.2) for the&#13;
implementation  of the ongoing  Rural Roads Project.   PIU  members include the&#13;
aforementioned Chairman, GRD's Director General, and a representative from the Ministry of&#13;
Finance, from the MITT and from the Ministry of Agriculture. The PIU will review and&#13;
follow up on procurement and bidding documents related to the project, monitor and&#13;
coordinate the implementation in every project component, assemble a quarterly report of all&#13;
information related to project implementation, and liaise and establish direct contact with the&#13;
IDA's and cofinanciers' supervision missions. All project policy issues will be discussed and,&#13;
in principle, decided by the PIU Board. On road safety issues, the PIU would coordinate and&#13;
agree with the Project Management Unit established in the MITT for the Transport Project&#13;
and its road safety component. GOA agreed to retain the PIU of the Rural Roads Project&#13;
for the implementation of the proposed project.&#13;
3.21   The PIU will be assisted in its day-to-day implementation work by an Executive&#13;
Secretariat, in the GRD Foreign Aid Department (where space and secretarial services are&#13;
available at no extra cost to the project), which will be responsible for the preparation and&#13;
processing of all project documentation. The Secretariat will include a Chief Secretary (civil&#13;
engineer) assisted by a Secretary (economist) and an Accountant, all from GRD's staff. An&#13;
important fourth member of, and adviser to, the Secretariat will be the Project Coordinator.&#13;
He should be a contract management and procurement expert who, along with the other&#13;
members of the Executive Secretariat, will be supported by GRD specialists from other&#13;
departments and by the international supervision consultants. The Project Coordinator will&#13;
work and report on a day-to-day basis within the Secretariat to the Chief Secretary but will&#13;
eventually be responsible before GRD's Director General. The main tasks and responsibilities&#13;
of the Project Coordinator and the PIU Executive Secretariat will be:&#13;
*     project coordination, liaison to Government, IDA, cofinanciers, and&#13;
consultants&#13;
*     planning of works and budgeting&#13;
*     resource allocation&#13;
*     selection, negotiation/award of contracts to the international consultant&#13;
teams and assistance to the consultants in administrative matters&#13;
*     finalization of prequalification and bidding documents&#13;
*     issuing of guidelines for prequalification and bidding&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-24-&#13;
*     preparation of overall project accounts&#13;
*     monitoring of progress, quality and financial performance&#13;
*     reporting (quarterly) to the Government, IDA, and cofinanciers&#13;
*     technical services to GRD&#13;
The PIU's Executive Secretariat will be deeply involved in the six-month (July-December&#13;
1996) inception period, before commencement of the physical implementation of the project,&#13;
currently scheduled for January 1997 (para 3.23). The establishment and staffing (except&#13;
Project Coordinator) of the Executive Secretariat was discussed and agreed at the&#13;
negotiations. The conditions of employment and related terms of reference (Annex 3.8) for&#13;
the Project Coordinator was also discussed and agreed with the Government during&#13;
negotiations. The appointment of the Project Coordinator will be a condition of Credit&#13;
Effectiveness.&#13;
3.22   GRD will be responsible for the implementation of all project components through&#13;
the direct involvement and coordination of the PIU Executive Secretariat and the Project&#13;
Coordinator. International consultants will be employed to assist GRD in construction&#13;
supervision (TOR in Annex 3.4) under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA. Acquisition&#13;
of equipment and materials for road maintenance, road safety and road signalization, together&#13;
with selection of experts for TA and training (road data bank, pavement and bridge&#13;
management systems, TA and training program for GRD and RRD executive staff) would&#13;
take place following submission to IDA, for review and approval, of the related documents&#13;
and evaluation of the proposed experts. During negotiations agreement was reached with&#13;
the Government on the terms of reference for (a) supervision of road works, Annex&#13;
3.4; (b) road data bank, Annex 3.5; (c) pavement management system, Annex 3.6; (d)&#13;
bridge management system, Annex 3.7; and (e) technical assistance and training&#13;
program for GRD and RRD executive staff, Annex 3.9.&#13;
3.23  A six-month project inception (preparatory) phase will be implemented June-&#13;
December 1996 before physical execution of the road works starts in January 1997. It will&#13;
include operational start of the PIU and its Executive Secretariat with the Project Coordinator&#13;
in July 1996, followed by procurement and mobilization of the consultants engineering&#13;
supervision team, and preparation of documentation for prequalification of contractors and&#13;
bidding of the road works.&#13;
3.24  The late initiation (1994) of IDA transport activity in Albania implies lack of transport&#13;
sector implementation profiles in the country. However, on the basis of past achievements on&#13;
similar projects under similar conditions in Albania and in the region, it is expected that the&#13;
prequalification and bidding documents process needed to complete project setup and begin&#13;
mobilization of road works would require a period of six months (July-December 1996).&#13;
Intense involvement of the PIU and the Project Coordinator,and of the consultants'&#13;
supervision team will be necessary. The six road-works contracts will be carried out over a&#13;
four-year period, with some beginning in 1997 the rest in 1998; completion will require from&#13;
one to two years for each contract. Each contract will include an one-year guaranteed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-25-&#13;
maintenance period following completion. Acquisition and delivery of GRD and Police&#13;
(maintenance and safety) equipment would be completed during the first two years of project&#13;
implementation, and completion of signalization would occur in the third year. The road data&#13;
bank and the pavement and bridge management systems will all take three years to&#13;
implement; the road data bank will begin in 1997, and the other two in 1998, with completion&#13;
expected in 1999 and 2000, respectively. The technical assistance and training program for&#13;
GRD and RRD staff would take place throughout the entire four-year project implementation&#13;
period in order to provide steady advice to GRD, the RRDs and UT's students, and to avoid&#13;
disruptions in project implementation due to excessive staff diversion resulting from fast&#13;
training.&#13;
3.25   The implementation schedule for project activities is shown in Annex 3.10. A Project&#13;
Implementation Plan defining the actions to be performed under the project, the agencies,&#13;
department or units responsible for the execution of each action and the latest date to start&#13;
each action, is shown in Annex 3.11. Credit effectiveness is expected in early fourth quarter&#13;
1996, start of project preparation and mobilization is planned for July 1996, physical&#13;
implementation would begin in January 1997, and the project would be completed on&#13;
December 31, 2000, with the proposed credit closing six months later on June 30, 2001. PIU&#13;
would submit quarterly reports to the Association during the implementation of every project&#13;
component activity on the basis of the monitoring indicators detailed in Annex 3.12. During&#13;
negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on the project&#13;
implementation schedule, Project Implementation Plan, monitoring criteria and&#13;
reporting arrangements.&#13;
H. Procurement&#13;
3.26  The project elements, their estimated costs, and the procurement arrangements for the&#13;
components to be financed or co-financed by IDA, are summarized in Table 3.4 below. Each&#13;
other cofinancier will have its own requirements of procurement; these costs are shown under&#13;
N.I.F. (non-IDA financed). Project launch workshop will be held in July 1996. The General&#13;
Procurement Notice shall be issued in June 1996 and will be followed up by Individual&#13;
Specific Notices (ISN) in Development Business for contracts estimated to cost US$10.0&#13;
million or more.&#13;

3.27  The road works contracts, under IDA financing, (Librazhd-Qukes, US$15.0 million;&#13;
and Miloti-Lezha, US$4.7 million) would be procured through international competitive&#13;
bidding (ICB) procedures in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement under&#13;
IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated January 1995, following prequalification of contractors&#13;
for each contract. The prequalification process would be in accordance with the Bank's&#13;
"Standard Prequalification Documents for Procurement of Works, and Major Equipment and&#13;
Industrial Installations", dated April 1993. The few domestic contractors, proceeding from&#13;
recently commercialized. state-owned companies, namely those forming joint ventures with&#13;
well-experienced and capitalized foreign companies, would be highly competitive, given their&#13;
country experience, low wage costs and new financial status. The provision of training for&#13;
GRD, RRD and local contractors and consultants will further enhance their experience,&#13;
efficiency and competitiveness.  Moreover, at the request of the Borrower, and under&#13;
conditions to be agreed under the credit agreement and set forth in the bidding documents, a&#13;
7.5 percent margin of preference for domestic contractors would be applied on bid evaluation.&#13;
The Bank's standard bidding documents for works shall be used and the domestic preferences&#13;
shall be applied in accordance with Bank's guidelines. Every contract for road works would&#13;
be subject to prior review and approval by IDA.&#13;
3.28  Maintenance equipment, vehicles and materials (Annex 3.2) would be procured under&#13;
ICB with post qualification of bidders (for US$4.8 million), and in accordance with the&#13;
Bank's guidelines for procurement.  The Bank's "Standard Bidding Documents for&#13;
Procurement of Goods by ICB", dated January 1995, will be used. Furthermore, at the request&#13;
of the borrower, and under conditions to be agreed in the credit agreement and set forth in the&#13;
bidding  documents,  equipment  nationally   manufactured  and/or  assembled  in&#13;
manufacturing/assembling facilities operating in Albania at least since the time of bid&#13;
submission would be granted a preference of 15 percent or exemption from related duties,&#13;
whichever is less, provided that the value added (labor, raw materials and components) within&#13;
Albania will account for more than 30 percent of the EXW (ex works, ex factory or off-the-&#13;
shelf) price of the product offered. Vertical and horizontal signalization goods (US$0.3&#13;
million, Annex 3.3) would be procured under national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's "Standard Bidding Documents for Procurement of Goods under&#13;
NCB", dated July 1995. as in this case of easy acquisition at national level, the advantages of&#13;
ICB are clearly outweighted by the administrative burden involved.  The remaining&#13;
equipment and materials for road safety (US$0.3 million) would be procured under&#13;
international/national shopping (IS/NS). The US$150,000 maximum aggregate under each IS&#13;
and NS vwould permit a quick procurement process for small contracts and would promote&#13;
(especially NS) the local new micro-industries. IS would apply for contracts estimated below&#13;
US$50,000 and would require at least three quotations from three different suppliers from at&#13;
least two countries. NS would apply for contracts estimated below US$30,000 and would&#13;
require a minimum of three quotations from three different suppliers. All contracts estimated&#13;
to cost US$50,000 equivalent or more would be subject to IDA's prior review and approval of&#13;
procurement documentation.  These limits would result in prior review  of contracts&#13;
representing 90 percent of the IDA credit component. The other contracts would be subject to&#13;
ex-post review after award of the contract.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-28-&#13;
3.29  Consulting services, TA and training will be carried out by qualified and experienced&#13;
consultants selected in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants",&#13;
dated August 1981. Consulting services for supervision of construction works (US$1.8&#13;
million) will be carried out by an international consulting firm. All TA (US$3.0 million) and&#13;
training (US$1.3 million) services will be contracted on the basis of a selected list (short-&#13;
listing) of qualified consulting firms. Short listing of consulting firms will be applied in the&#13;
selection of the project coordinator (US$1.0 million). The TOR documents related to&#13;
procurement of consulting services (Annexes 3.4 through 3.9) would be subject to prior&#13;
review and approval by the Association. Consultants' contracts exceeding US$100,000&#13;
equivalent for firms and US$S50,000 equivalent for individuals will be subject to prior&#13;
review and approval. This was discussed and agreed at negotiations.&#13;
3.30  A Country Procurement Assessment Report has not been completed because the&#13;
Public Procurement Law of Albania has just come into force, but one is planned for April&#13;
1996. However, for the IDA-financed portion of the project, the borrower would follow&#13;
procedures consistent with the Bank's procurement guidelines. The project implementation&#13;
schedule (Annex 3.10) includes a procurement plan indicating major items' costs, method of&#13;
procurement and a time schedule for all major procurement activities.&#13;
3.31   Procurement would be a main responsibility of the PIU (para 3.21) and the Project&#13;
Coordinator (Annex 3.8) financed under the project. Procurement information to be provided&#13;
to IDA  would include:  (a) prompt reporting of contract award information; (b)&#13;
comprehensive explanation of revised cost estimates for individual contracts and the total&#13;
project; (c) revised timing of procurement action (including advertising, bidding, ..ontract&#13;
award and completion time for individual contracts); and (d) compliance with aggregate&#13;
limits on specified methods of procurement. During negotiations, agreement was reached&#13;
with the Government on all procurement arrangements.&#13;
I. Disbursement&#13;
3.32  The proposed IDA Credit, SDR17.4 million or US$25.0 million equivalent, would be&#13;
disbursed against the project components as follows:&#13;

3.33   Contracts for works, contracts for goods exceeding US$50,000 equivalent, and&#13;
contracts for consulting firms and individuals exceeding US$100,000 and US$50,000&#13;
equivalent respectively, would be fully documented. Disbursements against contracts not&#13;
requiring prior review would be made on the basis of statements of expenditure (SOE).&#13;
During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government that documentation&#13;
to support expenditures financed under SOEs would be maintained by the Borrower&#13;
and made available for review by IDA supervision missions. In addition, they should be&#13;
audited annually by auditors acceptable to the Association.&#13;
3.34   Retroactive financing up to a total of US$200,000 would be available for payments&#13;
made by the borrower after May 1, 1996, but before the date of credit signature. This would&#13;
allow an early start on some critical items, such as hiring of the Project Coordinator and other&#13;
technical assistance services.&#13;
3.35  To facilitate disbursements and reduce the volume of withdrawal applications, IDA's&#13;
share of the project would be financed through a special account (SA, or revolving fund)&#13;
which would be opened by the borrower in a commercial bank acceptable to IDA. The&#13;
authorized allocation for the SA would be US$1.8 million, equivalent to about four months of&#13;
project expenditures financed by IDA during the four and-one-half year disbursement period&#13;
for the project.  However, unless the Association shall otherwise agree, the authorized&#13;
allocation shall be limited to US$800,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals shall be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-30-&#13;
equal to or exceed the equivalent of SDR3,000,000. Funds for equipment, vehicles and&#13;
material would be withdrawn by the borrower from the SA after approval of the ICB, NCB,&#13;
international or national shopping, and related contract awards by the Association.&#13;
Replenishment for technical assistance and for consultants for construction supervision would&#13;
be made on the basis of appropriate documentation. Replenishment of the SA would follow&#13;
IDA procedures. The SA would be audited annually by independent auditors acceptable to&#13;
IDA.  During negotiations, agreement was reached with the Government on the&#13;
establishment and operation of the SA in accordance with Albanian Treasury&#13;
regulations, as agreed with IDA, which require the establishment of the SA in the Bank of&#13;
Albania by the Treasury, the Treasury authorizing any payment into a commercial bank&#13;
account managed by the PIU upon PIU's request to pay the expenditures under the project.&#13;
3.36  A schedule of disbursements, based on the project implementation schedule (para&#13;
3.24) is given in Annex 3.13. Albania is a new IDA member. with only the Transport Project&#13;
and the Rural Roads Project yet under implementation in the transport sector. Thus, there are&#13;
no sectoral disbursement profiles available. However, the interest demonstrated by the&#13;
Government and GRD in the project, the urgency of the need for the works, equipment, TA&#13;
and training, and the actual disbursement under the two ongoing projects indicate a reasonable&#13;
project implementation period of 54 months.  With an early fourth quarter 1996 credit&#13;
effectiveiiess date, a July 1-December 31, 1996 project preparation (inception) phase and a&#13;
January 1, 1997 through December 31, 2000 project physical implementation period (para&#13;
3.25 and Annex 3.10), the proposed credit would be fully disbursed six months later on June&#13;
30. 2001.&#13;
J. Accounting and Auditing&#13;
3.37  Starting in July 1996, GRD would establish separate project accounts through its PIU&#13;
in accordance with acceptable accounting principles, record all project expenditures, and&#13;
maintain records on commitments, reimbursements, and the status of project funds on the&#13;
basis of the accounting done and released by every RRD. With respect to the amounts&#13;
withdrawn on the basis of SOEs, GRD would maintain records on contracts, invoices and&#13;
evidence of payments readily available for review. All records should also reflect adequately&#13;
the different contributions from the cofinanciers and the Government. GRD would submit to&#13;
IDA a brief update of these accounts in the quarterly reports (para.3.25). The PIU Secretary&#13;
would have the project accounts, including SOEs, and the special account (para. 3.35), audited&#13;
by an independent auditor (likely together with other IDA projects in order to achieve lower&#13;
audit costs) acceptable to IDA, and would submit annually to IDA such audit accounts&#13;
within six months of the end of each fiscal year. These requirements were agreed with&#13;
the Government at negotiations.&#13;
K. Environment&#13;
3.38  The project mainly consists of rehabilitation of existing national roads on the&#13;
Northern Corridor (para.3.07) and on the East-West Corridor (para.3.06) requiring only a&#13;
limited environmental review. In addition, the project includes construction of a new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-31-&#13;
Miloti-Lezha road (12.0 km) with two important new bridges over the Matit and Drin rivers.&#13;
Consequently, the project, in accordance with OD 4.01, has been placed under category "A",&#13;
requiring borrower's preparation and submission of an environmental impact assessment&#13;
(EIA) to the Bank.&#13;
3.39 GRD has prepared an EIA report submitted to the Board of the Bank on February 7,&#13;
1996. Review of the EIA report took place in accordance with terms of reference prepared by&#13;
the Bank. This review within the Bank warranted further work to strengthen the report in a&#13;
number of areas: (i) description of the environmental policy, (ii) legal and institutional&#13;
context, (iii) inclusion of a mitigation management and monitoring plan, (iv) identification&#13;
of training needs,  (v) cost of mitigation measures, and   (vi) responsibilities for&#13;
implementation.&#13;
3.40  The Environmental Assessment (EA) for the three road sections from Elbasan to Qafe&#13;
Thane on the East-West Corridor, which include some realignments, has been satisfactorily&#13;
completed by consultants employed by GRD and submitted to the Bank.&#13;
3.41   As the proposed routes for the new road and realignments of existing roads on the&#13;
Northern Corridor traverse unpopulated areas and some agricultural land, the environmental&#13;
impact is limited to encroachment on agricultural land, soil erosion, pollution at the Matit and&#13;
Drin rivers and air and water pollution from the construction activities (mainly quarries and&#13;
asphalt mixing plants). The environmental study prepared by GRD identifies these impacts&#13;
and proposes a mitigation and monitoring plan. Annex 3.14 summarizes the environmental&#13;
assessment report prepared by GRD.&#13;
IV. ECONOMIC EVALUATION&#13;
A. Framework&#13;
4.01    The project derives from the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy, which concentrates&#13;
on the removal of infrastructure bottlenecks that are a significant constraint on implementing the&#13;
stabilization program and on economic development (para. 1.02). Road investments were&#13;
identified by the Natiornal Road Investment Plan prepared by GRD, and the PIP prepared by the&#13;
GOA with Bank assistance (para. 1.10). The project follows on to the 1993 Transport Project,&#13;
which is 31 percent disbursed and is being implemented in a generally satisfactory manner, and&#13;
the Rural Roads Project, which became effective November 8, 1995, has started well and is&#13;
already disbursing. The main lesson leamed from ongoing projects was the importance of&#13;
keeping the objectives and composition of the project simple so as not to exceed the limited&#13;
absorptive capacity of GRD and MTC staff; this was taken into account in the project design&#13;
(paras. 1.I1-1.12).&#13;
4.02    The Government has made substantial progress in adopting market-based transport&#13;
policies since the start of the economic transformation in 1991, and there are no major policy&#13;
distortions that will affect the implementation of the project (paras. 1.05-1.08). The project will&#13;
continue policy initiatives begun with technical assistance and studies carried out under ongoing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-32-&#13;
projects in the areas of improving road maintenance. road safety and the system of road user&#13;
charges. The project is expected to have a further impact in each of these areas. The project is&#13;
also expected to encourage further privatization of road contracting, maintenance and planning,&#13;
complementing privatization efforts undertaken in other sectors with the support of the Bank.&#13;
4.03    The project is expected to facilitate the activities of virtually every sector of the&#13;
economy, so that benefits are likely to be dispersed, as is the case with most transport projects.&#13;
Savings in vehicle operating costs will accrue initially to internediate users (trucks, buses and&#13;
business users of passenger cars) and final consumers (private cars). Because the road transport&#13;
sector is now competitive, most of these savings should be passed on to final users of the goods&#13;
and services transported, which are distributed among all income groups. The environmental&#13;
impact of the project is also expected to be positive (reduction of vehicle emissions, improved&#13;
preparation of environmental assessments for road projects (paras. 2.27, 3.40 and 3.41).&#13;
4.04    GRD will monitor the impact of the project, both during implementation, with the&#13;
assistance of the PIU, and thereafter through regular traffic counts on project roads. GRD reports&#13;
on road maintenance activities, and the collection of road accident statistics by the traffic police.&#13;
B. Cost-Benefit Analysis&#13;
4.05    Economic rates of return (ERRs) and net present values (NPVs) were estimated for the&#13;
road improvement components of the project which comprise 79 percent of project cost. The&#13;
estimates were based on savings in vehicle operating costs and road maintenance costs. The&#13;
project is expected to have other benefits which are difficult to quantify, including improving the&#13;
organization and funding of road maintenance, promotion of privatization, reduction in road&#13;
accidents and environmental improvements. Moreover, the road maintenance component (13&#13;
percent of project cost) is expected to have a high ERR and NPV based on experience in other&#13;
countries. The estimates of economic viability are, therefore, considered to be conservative.&#13;
4.06    Costs and benefits were estimated using the Bank's HDMIII model as summarized in&#13;
Annex 4.1 and detailed in the Project File. Costs and benefits were converted to economic terms&#13;
by deducting indirect taxes. Cost estimates include physical contingencies (10%) and the cost of&#13;
supervision (3%). The cost of improving bridges on the Elbasan-Qafe Thane road under the&#13;
Transport Project (US$3.0 million) was also included for purposes of the economic evaluation.&#13;
Current traffic levels were estimated based on counts carried out by GRD in December 1995&#13;
(Annex 2.1). Albania's low motorization rate, current high traffic growth rate (about 17 percent&#13;
per annum) and prospects for the future, are discussed in para. 1.06. Traffic on project roads is&#13;
expected to grow. Vehicle operating costs were based on international normns, reduced by 25&#13;
percent (except fuel) to compensate for costs in lower income countries, e.q. the higher&#13;
proportion of older vehicles in the fleet (page 2 of Annex 4. 1). Congestion effects were taken&#13;
into account. Roughness indices were based on a visual road condition survey carried out in&#13;
1995 by GRD.&#13;
4.07    Based on these assumptions, reconstruction of the two-lane Elbasan-Qafe Thane road&#13;
(71.1 km) is estimated to have an ERR of 24 percent and an NPV of US$19.5 million (Annex&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-33-&#13;
4.1). Reconstruction of the two-lane Tapize-Fushe Kruja road (7.0 km) is estimated to have an&#13;
ERR of 87 percent and an NPV of US$3.7 million due to the poor condition of the existing&#13;
road. Constructing a new two-lane road from Miloti to Lezha (12.0 km) is estimated to have an&#13;
ERR of 44 percent and an NPV of US$21.0 million. This option was also compared with&#13;
rehabilitating the old road, and is estimated to increase the NPV by US$13.2 million (marginal&#13;
ERR 28 percent) due primarily to the 6.1 km distance saving with the new road. The weighted&#13;
average ERR for these road improvements. and hence the project, is estimated to be 30 percent&#13;
with an NPV of US$45.7 million.&#13;
C. Sensitivity and Risk Analysis&#13;
4.08     There are f'ew risks which would affect the economic evaluation. If traffic were to&#13;
grow only 10 percenit per annum during 1996-2000 and 5 percent per annum thereafter, project&#13;
benefits would be reduced by about 11 percent. If traffic grew only 8 and 4 percent per annum&#13;
during these periods, project benefits would be reduced by about 21 percent. Vehicle operating&#13;
costs, which were based on international norms, could be overestimated. If unanticipated&#13;
constructioni difficulties are encountered, costs could be higher than expected. If either project&#13;
costs are increased by 25 percent, or benefits are decreased by 25 percent, the project ERR is&#13;
estimated to be 21 percent or 20 percent respectively. The NPVs for all project roads remain&#13;
positive, and the ERRs are 19% or greater (Annex 4.1). The economic feasibility estimate for&#13;
the project is therel'ore considered to be robust.&#13;
4.09    The more significant risks are of a broader institutional nature:&#13;
(a)     GRD and MC"''s institutional capacity is limited, and this is the third IDA transport&#13;
prorect to be under simultaneous implementation. To reduce this risk, the PIU will be&#13;
adequately staf'fed and supported by consultants (para.3.21).&#13;
(b)    'I'he GOA could fail to provide sufficient counterpart funds for the project, or&#13;
cotinancinig could fail to materialize (para 3.19). In this event, the scope of the project&#13;
would be reduced.&#13;
(c)     Thle GOA could fail to establish an adequate system for administering and funding&#13;
non-GRD roads (para. 2.25). However, the Government has already implemented&#13;
significant sector reforms under difficult economic conditions, supported in part by&#13;
the Association. The momentum for reform is considered to be sustainable.&#13;
(d)     There is a risk the Government might undertake uneconomic investments if financing&#13;
were offered. This will be mitigated by the annual GOA/IDA consultations on the&#13;
transport investment plan (para. 1. 10).&#13;
With the arrangements and assurances provided under the project, project risks are considered to&#13;
be acceptable.&#13;
&#13;

Road User Charges Model&#13;
1.    The Road User Charges (RUC) Model is currently under development by the World&#13;
Bank. The objective is to estimate road user charges required to ensure that: (i) the cost of&#13;
operating and maintaining the rnain interurban road network is fully funded, and (ii)&#13;
budgetary transfers to road agencies managing local rural roads and urban roads are sufficient&#13;
to ensure their maintenance programs are also fully funded, and (iii) sufficient funds are&#13;
available to finance investments in main interurban roads, to support investments in local&#13;
rural roads and urban roads, and to meet debt service obligations. Maintenance cost estimates&#13;
are based on the Bank's Highway Design and Maintenance Standard Model (HDMIII).&#13;
2.    In order to optimize the use of the road network, and thereby maximize net economic&#13;
benefits to the country, road user charges should be set equal to the cost of the resources&#13;
consumed when using the road network. There are two costs to be considered:&#13;
(i) the damage done to the road surface by passage of (especially heavy) vehicles,&#13;
(ii) the additional costs that each road user imposes on other road users and on&#13;
the rest of the society (congestion costs).&#13;
However, since less than half of the costs of operating and maintaining the road network vary&#13;
with the traffic, and roads in most developing countries do not experience sufficient&#13;
congestion to cover fixed costs, prices set equal to short-run marginal costs will result in&#13;
large financial deficits. It is reasonable to assume that these deficits should be financed by&#13;
road users (or those who benefit from road access in the case of local access roads) since they&#13;
are among the wealthiest members of society. Although the poor depend heavily on public&#13;
transport, it is better to assist the poor by providing other forms of income support, possibly&#13;
including subsidizing selected transport services.&#13;
3.    The model assumes that:&#13;
(i) the total cost of operating and maintaining the interurban road network will&#13;
be financed through road user charges,&#13;
(ii) only the variable cost of operating and maintaining local rural roads and&#13;
urban roads will be financed through road user charges, and&#13;
(iii) the balance of the required expenditures for local rural roads and urban roads&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46-&#13;
Annex 2.6&#13;
Pagu 2 of 2&#13;
will be financed by local taxes (e.g. parking charges, local property taxes.&#13;
market taxes).&#13;
In addition, the model allows, through the iterative adjustment of road user charges, to assure&#13;
that each vehicle class (notably heavy trucks), covers at least its variable costs.&#13;
4.    Model inputs and calculations are shown in the Attachment to this Annex. The length&#13;
of the main rural, local rural, and urban road networks in Albania for each surface type and&#13;
estimated traffic level (reference main text) are shown on page I to the attachment. T he&#13;
vehicle fleet is shown on page 3, together with the estimated kilometers driven per year by&#13;
each vehicle class, adjusted for conditions in Albania. The weight and fuel consumption of&#13;
each vehicle class were also estimated based on international norms. Unit road maintenance&#13;
costs, shown on page 6 to the attachment, were adjusted to Albanian conditions based on the&#13;
experience of GRD maintenance engineers. Investments in the main rural road network in&#13;
1995 are shown on page 2, together with estimated budgetary allocations by the central&#13;
government for local rural roads and urban roads. Local governments are not believed to&#13;
have any other source of revenue for roads in 1995. Expenditures on traffic police (which&#13;
should also be covered by road user charges) were estimated based on international norms as&#13;
shown on page 2 to the attachment. Current road user charges are shown on page 4,&#13;
comprising fuel taxes and vehicle registration fees as discussed in the main text. Customs&#13;
duties on fuel, which apply to all imports, were not considered to be fuel taxes. The model&#13;
was tested with two assumptions: (i) all fuel taxes are included (page 4 of Attachment to this&#13;
Annex); and (ii) only the portion of the fuel tax which is called a "road tax" is included (page&#13;
5 of Attachment to this Annex).&#13;
5.    Using the above inputs, the model computes the annual routine (e.g. patching and&#13;
grading) and periodic (overlay and regraveling) maintenance costs needed to maintain the&#13;
network which minimizes economic costs, defined as the sum of road expenditures plus&#13;
vehicle operating costs. The model divides total costs into variable (those which change with&#13;
traffic and axle loading) and fixed costs (those which are independent of road utilization, see&#13;
footnotes to the attachment). The model then calculates the funds which should optimally be&#13;
spent on the main rural road network, as well as on the local road network and urban road&#13;
network (page I to the attachment). It also calculates which agency should finance these&#13;
expenditures (page 2), the road user charges required to cover the variable costs of each&#13;
vehicle class (page 3), and the revenues collected from each vehicle class (page 4). It then&#13;
compares revenues to costs for each vehicle class, as well as in aggregate (page 4 to the&#13;
attachment).&#13;
6.    Results are discussed in paras. 2.20-2.24 of the main text.&#13;

c) QUKES-QAFE THANE (19.6 km).&#13;
Improvement. enlargement and rehabilitation of the final20 km of the road link to the&#13;
Macedonian border at Qafe Thane. The upgrading includes improvement of drainage,&#13;
enlargement (when required) of the road to a 7.00 m wide asphalted carriageway and two&#13;
1.0 m wide gravel shoulders, improvement of the intersection diverting traffic to Qafe&#13;
Thane and Pogradec. and about 3.2 km of a climbing lane on various segments with&#13;
gradients exceeding 7%. The terrain is mountainous. (see the cross section (i) bellow),&#13;
except the last 4.0 kmn running on a 800 m high plateau near the Ohrid lake. Estimated&#13;
traffic: 3.100 v.p.d. with high incidence of trucks (40%) mostly intemational traffic from&#13;
F.Y.R. of Macedonia and Bulgaria. Therefore this section in some places includes third&#13;
line for heavy vehicles and trucks (see cross section (ii) bellow). The whole 19.7 km road&#13;
section area is sparsely populated but for a few small villages. Starting construction:&#13;
1998. Construction period: 24 months. Contractual maintenance period: 12 months.&#13;

Construction of a new 12.0 km road section (7.50 m wide asphalted carriagewav and&#13;
two 1.50 m wide gravel shoulders) shortening the trip between Miloti and Lezha by 6.1&#13;
km. and avoiding traffic congestion through the two cities. The road will pass through an&#13;
uninhabitated area requirinSg expropriation of 15 ha of land. The terrain is flat. Estimated&#13;
traffic: 4,540 v.p.d with 20 % of trucks. Starting construction: 1997. Construction period:&#13;
24 months. Contractual maintenance period: 12 months.&#13;

c) MATIT and DRIN Bridges.&#13;
Completion of the new road from Miloti- Lezha (12.0 km) requires construction of two&#13;
important new bridges. One over the Matit river. starting at km 1+357 of the new road&#13;
and 650 m long; the other over the Drin river. starting at km 10+300 and 200 m long.&#13;
Both bridges are designed to rest on piled foundations over solid gravel soil (as shown the&#13;
Cross Section bellow), and are calculated tor stresses at the base and along the shaft, with&#13;
the exception of the precast (bored type, 1.200 mm in diameter) piles. The girders (most&#13;
of them 20 m standard length) and deck slabs will be prefabricated. and the whole design&#13;
of the structures takes into account the seismic characteristics of the area (level 7 on the&#13;
Richter scale). The live load with which both bridges are calculated is N-30 and T-80&#13;
(Albanian standards KTP 22 and 23). Estimated traffic: 4.550 v.p.d. with 20% of trucks.&#13;
Starting construction: 1998. Construction period: 24 months. Contractual maintenance&#13;
period: 12 months.&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
A.    SCOPE OF WORKS&#13;
1.    The Government of Albania (GOA) has requested assistance from the World Bank,&#13;
International Development Association (IDA), and other donors for a program of new&#13;
construction, rehabilitation, strengthening, and completion of unachieved works of selected&#13;
priority sections of the National Road Network. The General Roads Directorate (GRD) of&#13;
the Ministry of Construction and Tourism (MCT) will be responsible for the supervision of&#13;
the works to be carried out by prequalified contractors selected through International&#13;
Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures.    -&#13;
2.    The works to be carried out include, besides construction of 12 km of a new road&#13;
(Miloti-Lezha) with two new 650m long (Matit river) and 200m long (Drin river) bridges,&#13;
under two separated contracts, road improvements such as pavement reconstruction,&#13;
pavement overlays, widening, shoulder strengthening, drainage structures, retaining walls,&#13;
new base and sub-base, in the six road sections specified in the Attachment 1 to these&#13;
Terms of Reference (T.O.R.). The reconstructed pavements consists of gravel sub-base,&#13;
crushed rock base course, binder and asphalt concrete wearing course. The length,&#13;
estimated cost, starting construction year, and period of construction are detailed in the&#13;
Attachment 1. The total implementation period of the whole program would be forty eight&#13;
(48) months with individual contractual periods varying between twelve (12) and twenty&#13;
four (24) months. The maintenance period for each contract would be twelve (12) months.&#13;
3.     On behalf of the GOA, the GRD proposes to invite technical and financial&#13;
proposals from shortlisted Consultants to assist the central and regional units of GRD in&#13;
bid evaluation, construction supervision, and maintenance services of the works on the&#13;
basis of the available designs and bidding documents prepared by GRD. One team would&#13;
be selected to carry out the supervision of the seven works contracts of the East-West (3&#13;
contracts) and North (4 contracts) Corridors. The Consultants' team will be assisted by a&#13;
GRD team designed for supervision of each contract.. Details of the invitation/evaluation&#13;
of proposals are given in Attachment 2 to these T.O.R.&#13;
&#13;

required, and advise the procurement/selection team established for the prequalification&#13;
process and for the evaluation of bids. He would take an active and important role in the&#13;
preparation of the bids evaluation report. The fees for this service should be specified in the&#13;
Consultant's offer duly separated from those of supervision of works (for which these&#13;
T.O.R. are mainly meant) on the base of daily fees. Therefore, the Resident Engineer (or,&#13;

the one-year maintenance contractual period to be established for the maintenance of works&#13;
after completion.&#13;
11.   The Contractor shall provide the Consultant furnished office and residential space,&#13;
and transportation free of charge as per bidding documents. The Contractor shall also&#13;
provide additional technical services duly justified.&#13;
12.    The Consultant and its expatriate staff shall be exempt from payment of income&#13;
tax. The GRD shall assist the Consultant in obtaining any entry/exit visa, or other official&#13;
formalities required to satisfactorily fulfill their work. However, the cost of the same shall&#13;
be borne by the Consultant.&#13;
13.   Any reports, documents, drawings, and in general, any available information related&#13;
to the design and execution of the works shall be made available by the GRD to the&#13;
Consultant.&#13;
14.   All documentation related to works is, and will remain after completion of works,&#13;
GRD's property. The Consultant can not use or dispose of this documentation without&#13;
previous written consent.&#13;

account the seismic characteristics of the area (level 7 on the&#13;
Richter scale).  The live load with which both bridges are&#13;
calculated is N-30 and T-80 (Albanian standards KTP 22 and 23).&#13;
Estimated cost: US$6.8 million. Estimated traffic: 4,550 v.p.d.&#13;
with 20% of trucks. Starting construction: 1998. Construction&#13;
period: 24 months. Contractual maintenance period: 12 months.&#13;

INVITATION FOR PROPOSALS&#13;
Sample Letter&#13;
Dear Sirs:&#13;
We are pleased to informn you that your firm of Consultants has been shortlisted by us&#13;
for submission of Technical and Financial proposals for construction supervision of (names of&#13;
the related contracts in Attachment 1) approximately (number) km. Terms of reference for&#13;
construction supervision services are enclosed herewith for your study and information.&#13;
The bids for construction works are being issued to the interested prequalified&#13;
contractors and shall be opened on (Opening Date). The project has been designed by the&#13;
General Roads Directorate (GRD).&#13;
Technical and financial proposals are required to be submitted in separate covers&#13;
(three copies to GRD and one copy to World Bank, IDA). The technical proposal should&#13;
include names and CV's of the proposed members of the supervision team. The financial&#13;
proposal shall contain all inclusive man-month rates for each category. Man-month rates are&#13;
paid according to the actual presence at site. The financial proposal shall be split into two&#13;
parts, namely, Construction Supervision and Maintenance Period services.&#13;
Evaluation of the technical proposals of the firms invited (minimum of three and&#13;
maximum of six firms to be invited) will take into consideration (a) the firm's general&#13;
experience in the field of the assignment, (b) the adequacy of the proposed work plan and&#13;
approach in responding to the Terms of Reference, and (c) very specifically, the qualification&#13;
and competence of the personnel proposed for the assignment.&#13;
Price will also be used as a selection factor but it should never undermine the quality&#13;
of the Technical Proposal. The technical evaluation will be undertaken independently and free&#13;
from the influence of price. A two-stage procedure will, therefore, be adopted with the&#13;
technical and financial proposals submitted separately in sealed envelopes, as mentioned&#13;
above. The technical evaluation will be completed before the price proposal is reviewed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Technical evaluation will be made on the basis of a 100 points ceiling, consisting of&#13;
Experience in the relevant field 15 points, Technical Proposal 35 points, and CV's of&#13;
Supervision team 50 points. Financial proposal should be given 20 percent weight. To that&#13;
effect, results of technical evaluation should be converted into 80 points by multiplying by a&#13;
factor of 0.80 to which results of financial evaluation should be added to arrive at final&#13;
figures. Only firms scoring 64 points or more in the technical evaluation process, will be&#13;
taken into price consideration and final selection. Maximum of 20 points should be given to&#13;
lowest price offered. The financial score (points) of the other offers will be proportionately&#13;
lower according to the formula:&#13;
Price of Lowest Bid&#13;
Score (points) =                                 x 20&#13;
Price of Bid to the Considered&#13;
The selected Consultant shall be one which has highest added score from Technical&#13;
and Financial Evaluation. The time allowed for submission of proposals is (minimum 45&#13;
days) after the date of this letter of invitation. The period for which each Consultant's&#13;
proposal will be held valid, and during which the Consultant will undertake to maintain&#13;
without charge the proposed staffing (including named Personnel) and the proposed price, is&#13;
120 days after the above closing date for submission of proposals. If contract award is delayed&#13;
beyond the original bid validity period, the successful bidder's bid price will be increased for&#13;
each week of delay by two correction factors (to be discussed with and acceptable to IDA),&#13;
the first one to be applied to all foreign currency components and the second one to the local&#13;
component of the bid price.&#13;
The contract to be signed with the selected Consultant firm will be a time-based rate&#13;
(man-month) contract. The time-based rate, which is the man-month, includes salary, social&#13;
costs, firm's overhead, travel costs, fee or profit, and an overseas allowance.&#13;
In principle, the estimated day by which the selected Consultant is expected to&#13;
commence the assignment, is (Day, Month, Year).&#13;
The Technical and Financial Proposals, marked on the envelope as proposals for&#13;
Consultancy Services (Name of the Road Contract), shall be submitted on or before (Hour,&#13;
Day, Month and Year of Submission Deadline) to the following addresses:&#13;

NATIONAL ROADS PROJECT&#13;
Road Data Bank&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
A.    INTRODUCTION&#13;
I .    During the last three years, the macroeconomic stabilization of Albania has met and&#13;
even exceed the fixed performance targets. The number of registrated vehicles has grown&#13;
sevenfold during the last five years, and it is expected to continue growing rapidly and&#13;
significantly.&#13;
2.    The tremendous growth in road transport has created key infrastructure bottlenecks,&#13;
which can be restrictive in relation to ongoing development, and it has created the&#13;
deterioration of the national road network, which presents a major impediment to private&#13;
sector development and to foreign direct investment.&#13;
3.    The scarce and imprecise existing road data make extremely difficult to estimate&#13;
and plan any needs and required investments, as well as to achieve a satisfactory road&#13;
policy. In order to meet these needs, the National Roads Project would introduce a new&#13;
management system, namely a Road Data Bank, which will be the basis and will be&#13;
followed, once sufficiently developed, by a Pavement Management System and a Bridge&#13;
Management System.&#13;
B.  CONCEPT OF A ROAD DATA BANK&#13;
4.    The Road Data Bank (RDB) would be a general information system for the General&#13;
Roads Directorate (GRD) producing systematic and timely statistics on road and traffic&#13;
conditions of the National Road Network (NRN; 3,221km) under GRD's jurisdiction. This&#13;
information would be kept and compiled in computers and used as data base for&#13;
management systems. At present there is no RDB in the GRD.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-74-&#13;
Annex 3.5&#13;
Page 2 of 3&#13;
C.    OBJECTIVES&#13;
5.    The main things that the RDB is to be used for are:&#13;
-daily administration of the NRN;&#13;
-planning;&#13;
-road maintenance management;&#13;
-traffic management;&#13;
-provision of basic data for a Pavement Management System; and&#13;
- provision of basic data for a Bridge Management System&#13;
D.   SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
6.    In order to secure its sustainability, the full development of the RDB should be&#13;
carried out in three phases over a period of three years which respectively will (i) establish&#13;
the reference system and definitions and procedures for data collection, (ii) establish a&#13;
geographic information system and modify and accommodate the system for more&#13;
advanced applications as the Pavement Management System and the Bridge Management&#13;
System, and (iii) undertake (GRD and Consultants) a thorough quality control of the RDB&#13;
and minor modifications required. The services to be provided by the Consultant for the&#13;
RDB during the three phases, are described below.&#13;
PHASE I&#13;
7.    Analysis and Specification.  Consultants will assist GRD in setting up the&#13;
organization to manage and monitor the establishment and implementation of the RDB.&#13;
The organization shall include task groups GRD/Consultants which would participate in&#13;
analysis, specification and implementation phases, and would be responsible for the&#13;
functionality of the RDB.&#13;
8.    The RDB shall have a modular structure enabling modules to the developed&#13;
independently. The content of each module, their interconnection, and the data structure&#13;
should be described. The Consultants shall also recommend the type of hardware to be&#13;
used for RDB operation, and shall prepare the required procurement documentation and&#13;
assist GRD in the procurement process of this hardware.&#13;
9.    The Analysis and Specification component would require four man-month (m/m)&#13;
of consultant manpower and would be finished six months after RDB start. Outputs are a&#13;
detailed description of the RDB and procurement documents for hardware.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-75-&#13;
Annex 3.5&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
10.   Reference System. The Consultants should suggest a reference system, and after&#13;
GRD's approval, set up a plan for its establishment. A system based on kilometer&#13;
markings, in accordance with European Union standards, is suggested. The Consultants&#13;
shall assist in procurement of markings and on training of local staff for establishing the&#13;
reference system in the field.&#13;
11.   This component is estimated to require 3m/m (Consultant) and 6m/m (local staff),&#13;
and to be completed in 8 months after RDB start. The output is a reference system in the&#13;
field and in the RDB.&#13;
12.   Basic Modules.  The basic modules as described in the above specification&#13;
component should be developed and implemented. They should include registration of&#13;
data, system and operation software for a high quality RDB, and registers for road, traffic&#13;
and bridge data. The registers should be developed in cooperation with the Consultants&#13;
responsible for the development of the Pavement Management System, and of the Bridge&#13;
Management System. Documentation, manuals and computer programs should be prepared&#13;
in English and Albanian.&#13;
13.   The basic modules should be developed and implemented 12 months after RDB&#13;
start and would require about 15 m/m of Consultancy.&#13;
14.   Training. GRD staff shall be trained by the Consultants in the field and through&#13;
lecturing. A plan for the training (in a mere cost estimate way) is part of the overall&#13;
training component of the National Roads Project. However, a Plan for Training with&#13;
specific targets to be achieved, must form part of Consultants' proposal.&#13;
15.   Handling Over and Description of Later Phases. The Consultant at the end of&#13;
Phase I should (i) carry out an overall control of the whole Phase I of the RDB, and hand it&#13;
over to GRD's responsible staff, and (ii) apply experience acquired in Phase I for&#13;
conforming the contents of Phase II and III. All these activities would not require more&#13;
than I ni/m (Consultant).&#13;
PHASE II&#13;
16.  In Phase lI the Consultants shall evaluate the experience of running the RDB and&#13;
identify modifications required. Furthermore, the Consultants will continue the&#13;
development of the RDB by introducing a simple geographic information system.&#13;
Preparation of a reference map system should be included in their activity. This system&#13;
would be operational in a multi-user environment. The Consultants manpower for Phase 11&#13;
is estimated at 8 m/m.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-76-&#13;
Annex 3.5&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
PHASE III&#13;
17.   The third and last phase of the establishment of the RDB includes an overall quality&#13;
control of the already set up RDB. The Consultants, systematically and thoroughly, will&#13;
examine and propose subsequent remedies (e.g., minor modifications and further activities&#13;
required), if any, the RDB organization, data collection and updating procedures, and&#13;
application programs, and interfaces with other management systems, as the Pavement&#13;
Management System and the Bridge Management System. Consultants manpower&#13;
required for Phase III is estimated at 1 m/m.&#13;
E.   REQUIREMENTS TO THE CONSULTANT&#13;
18.   The Consultant shall prove its experience in the development and operation of&#13;
RDB's in order to qualify for the contract, and shall also provide full CVs of staff proposed&#13;
and duration of their presence in Albania during the RDB project. Proven similar previous&#13;
experience for working in Albania should be positively considered.&#13;
F.    REPORTING&#13;
19.   An Inception Report specifying the framework for the RDB should be provided&#13;
after four months of RDB start. The Consultant would also write a Progress Report at the&#13;
end of each Phase detailing the problems encountered, issues raised and targets achieved,&#13;
including the efficiency (in qualitative and quantitative terms) of the training provided to&#13;
duly identified GRD staff in the use, maintenance, and development of the RDB. The&#13;
Progress Report at -the end of Phase III would be a comprehensive Final Report of the&#13;
establishment of the whole RDB system in GRD. Five copies of each report, in English,&#13;
will be provided to GRD and two to IDA.&#13;
G.  ESTIMATED MANPOWER&#13;
20.   The total estimated Consultants mi/m for the R.D.B., as detailed in the above&#13;
T.O.R., is 32 m/m. The Consultants' proposal should include an estimate of the local&#13;
manpower (in m/m and qualifications) required in GRD.&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
A.   INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.     The National Road Network (NRN; 3,221km) under the juridiction of the General&#13;
Roads directorate (GRD) in the Ministry of Construction and Tourism (MCT) carries out&#13;
more than 80 percent of the whole road traffic in Albania. The status of such an important&#13;
and valuable national asset is deficient with most pavements not suited to modem traffic.&#13;
GRD lacks a detailed inventory of the NRN including pavement age (most pavements are&#13;
beyond their design life), and main topographical, geological, structural, safety and&#13;
environmental characteristics of any road section.&#13;
2.    The condition of most pavements is cause of concern, not only structurally and&#13;
economically (high vehicle operating costs damaging the efficiency of the transport sector)&#13;
but also for safety of a traffic which has increased sevenfold during the last five years and is&#13;
expected to continue growing rapidly and significantly.  A  detailed knowledge and&#13;
examination of the present situation is an urgent need in GRD. Considering the above&#13;
circumstances, the National Roads Project includes, as one of its components, the&#13;
establishment of a Pavement Management System in Albania.&#13;
B.  CONCEPT OF A PAVEMENT MANAGEMENT SYSTEM&#13;
3.    A Pavement Management System (PMS), consists, basically, on the design of a&#13;
systematic approach to road maintenance and, specifically, to pavement management. The&#13;
PMS evaluates the present condition of road surfaces and optimizes expenditure on&#13;
maintenance from a GRD's as well as from a socio-economic and a traffic safety point of&#13;
view. Input is obtained through a field inventory of functions and structural pavement&#13;
condition data and traffic load data. These data are then processed by means of pavement&#13;
performance models. Inventory data, and necessary road information, are stored in the Road&#13;
Data Bank (also being established under the National Roads Project), and the PMS is linked to&#13;
the Road Data Bank as an application program. The PMS receives data from the Road Data&#13;
Bank when they are needed for PMS processing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-78-&#13;
Annex 3.6&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
C.   OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.    The PMS, basically a tool with the overall purpose to enable GRD to ensure that road&#13;
maintenance is carried out in the optimal way, aims at the objectives of (i) obtaining the most&#13;
precise view of the road network condition, (ii) assessing the best strategy to calculate the&#13;
optimum  maintenance budget, and  (iii) providing the inforrnation required for road&#13;
construction.&#13;
5.   In order to secure the sustainability of the project, the development and&#13;
implementation of the full system shall be carried out in three phases over a period of three&#13;
years. The first phase will deliver a simple pilot PMS to be developed and tested in a specific&#13;
area. On this basis, the pilot PMS should be modified and applied to the whole NRN. A&#13;
second phase will include further data collection and the introduction of economic evaluation&#13;
models. During the third and last phase, the Consultants will undertake a thorough quality&#13;
control of the PMS and introduce minor modifications, if required.&#13;
D.   SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
PHASE I&#13;
6.    Initial Activities. The first Consultants' activity should be an analysis and detailed&#13;
work plan of the PMS. The Consultants will also assist GRD in setting up the PMS&#13;
organization (Consultants/GRD staff) which will manage and monitor the entire development&#13;
and operations of the PMS. The organization groups will participate in the analysis,&#13;
specification and implementation phases and will be responsible for decisions on PMS'&#13;
functionality. These initial activities will be detailed in an Inception Report to be delivered&#13;
two months after commencement of works. The report will be reviewed, commented, and&#13;
eventually approved, by GRD and IDA within a month after delivery. Estimated Consultant&#13;
manpower: 8 man-month (m/m).&#13;
7.    Organizational Setup.  On the basis of the likely development of the road sector&#13;
administration in Albania, the Consultants should clarify the present organization in GRD and&#13;
specify the setup for the PMS organization in GRD. This task, to be completed within one&#13;
month after approval of the Inception Report, is estimated to require 2 m/m of Consultants'&#13;
services.&#13;
8.    PMS Analysis and Program  Specification.  The PMS to be delivered will be&#13;
specifically in accordance with Albanian condition. It will be based, preferably, on an&#13;
existing PMS already developed and proven on a national road network similar on size an&#13;
characteristics to the Albanian network. The PMS should provide flexibility on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-79-&#13;
Annex 3.6&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
amount of data required and will allow introduction of a simple version in the first phase. The&#13;
Consultants will carry out an analysis and specification in which the PMS modules and&#13;
functions are defined and decided. Important elements to be specified are repair alternatives&#13;
and unit prices. This task will be completed four months after the previous task, and would&#13;
require about 12 m/m of Consultants' manpower. Output is a tailor-made PMS.&#13;
9.     Data Needs.  The PMS will mainly use data provided by the Road Data Bank&#13;
(RDB). However, the PMS also needs important condition data. The Consultants will analyze&#13;
the minimal data requirements and procure equipment for data collection. In the first stage,&#13;
the PMS will require general visual condition information, and information on evenness&#13;
(roughness) and traffic volume. This task would require 16 m/m of Consultants' manpower&#13;
and about 20 m/m of local staff. The output are data for testing the PMS.&#13;
10.   Testing of the PMS.  The accuracy of the design of the tailor-made PMS, and&#13;
subsequent modifications, if any, found necessary by the Consultants, will be tested with the&#13;
data from the pilot area. The output of this task, estimated to require 4 m/m of Consultants'&#13;
manpower, will be the establishment of a working PMS in GRD.&#13;
11.   Supplementary Data Collection.   Now is the time of starting condition data&#13;
collection for the rest of the network. This task will be carried out by GRD counterpart staff&#13;
under Consultants' supervision. Estimate of Consultants' manpower for this task is 4 in/m.&#13;
The output is the availability of a PMS with condition data for the entire NRN.&#13;
12.   Preparation of a Maintenance Plan. Ending Phase I, GRD, with the assistance of&#13;
the Consultants (estimated 4 m/m manpower), and on the basis of the PMS, will set up the&#13;
plan for the following fiscal year. The plan should include a ranking of repair works matching&#13;
the budget.&#13;
13.   Manuals and Training. Manuals for the implementation of the designed PMS will&#13;
be written, in English, by GRD staff but under Consultants' supervision and full responsibility&#13;
for correctness.  GRD will be responsible of manuals' translation into Albanian.  The&#13;
Consultants will select a GRD group (at least three persons) and train them on the full use of&#13;
the PMS. This group will be trained in such a way to be able to train future GRD groups in&#13;
the use of PMS.&#13;
PHASE II&#13;
14.   Additional Data Elements. Further to GRD's capability to run the PMS, data&#13;
elements for bearing capacity and traffic loads should be supplemented. Consultants will&#13;
provide specifications for the software modules and shall assist GRD on the procurement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-80-&#13;
Annex 3.6&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
of required equipment (at least, one falling weight deflectometer, and two permanent or&#13;
mobile weigh bridges). Estimated Consultants' manpower: 8 m/m. Output: a modified PMS&#13;
taking structural pavement properties into account.&#13;
15.   Economic Evaluation and Deterioration Models. Consultants should introduce and&#13;
adjust deterioration and economic models to Albanian conditions. With these models in place,&#13;
it will be possible to deternine the future budget needs for pavement maintenance. This task&#13;
will be carried out over a period of 12 months to allow for seasonal variations in the&#13;
deterioration models. Estimated Consultants' manpower: 6 rn/m. Output are projections of&#13;
maintenance needs.&#13;
PHASE III&#13;
16.   The phase III will include an overall quality control of the PMS. Consultants will&#13;
assess PMS' organization, data collection, updating procedures and application programs,&#13;
carrying out minor modifications, if required, and suggesting further activities, if appropriate.&#13;
Phase III will extend for 12 months beyond completion of Phase II, requiring 2 rn/m of&#13;
Consultants' manpower.&#13;
E.   TRAINING, MANUALS, AND FINAL REPORT&#13;
17.   GRD should be trained by the Consultants in the field and through classroom&#13;
lecturing. A plan for the training (in a mere cost estimate way) is part of the overall training&#13;
component of the National Roads Project. However, a plan for training, with specific targets&#13;
to be achieved, must form part of Consultants' proposal.&#13;
18.   During the implementation of the PMS, GRD staff will participate in the writing of&#13;
PMS user manuals under the lead and full responsibility, for their correctness, of the&#13;
Consultants. GRD would be responsible for the translation into Albanian of the original&#13;
English version.&#13;
19.   At the end of Phase III, the Consultants should prepare a Draft Final Report&#13;
summarizing the whole PMS establishment process in GRD, and describing PMS main&#13;
components and operational characteristics. The draft (five copies to GRD, two copies to&#13;
IDA) should be reviewed and commented by GRD and IDA within the next month after its&#13;
delivery. Subsequently, GRD's and IDA's comments should be included in the final version&#13;
of the report.&#13;
20.   The Draft Final Report should include a list of GRD identified trainees explaining type&#13;
of proficiency achieved in the use and operation of the PMS and its differences with the&#13;
training plan proposed in para. 1 7 above.&#13;

TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
A.   INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.    The National Road Network (NRN 3,221 km), under the jurisdiction of the General&#13;
Roads Directorate (GRD) in the Ministry of Construction and Tourism (MCT), includes a&#13;
vast and indispensable network of about 1,200 bridges of more than 10 meter length. The&#13;
status of such an important and valuable national asset is deficient. GRD lacks an&#13;
inventory of the bridges and, obviously and consequently, a detailed knowledge of their&#13;
age (most of them beyond their design life) and main topographical, geological, structural&#13;
and environmental characteristics.&#13;
2.    The condition of many bridges is cause of concern not only structurally but also for&#13;
traffic safety, given the sevenfold growth of traffic during the last five years. It is expected&#13;
to continue growing rapidly and significantly. A detailed examination and knowledge of&#13;
the present situation appears as an urgent need to be considered in the GRD. Considering&#13;
the above circumstances, the National Road Project includes as one of its components the&#13;
establishment in Albania of a Bridge Management System.&#13;
B.  CONCEPT OF A BRIDGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM&#13;
3.    A  Bridge Management System  (BMS) is a systematic approach to bridge&#13;
maintenance. The BMS evaluates the present condition of the structures on the road&#13;
network and optimizes expenditure on maintenance from the GRD's as well as from a&#13;
socio-economic and safety point of view. Input is obtained through inspection of the&#13;
structures by well-trained bridge experts. Inventory data and necessary traffic information&#13;
are to be stored in the Road Data Bank (also being developed as a specific component of&#13;
the National Roads Project) to which the BMS should be linked as an application program.&#13;
C.   OBJECTIVES&#13;
4.    The main objectives of the BMS are to  (i) secure that resources for bridge&#13;
maintenance are spent in the best way providing the best operational and safety traffic&#13;
conditions, and (ii) calculate the optimum budget level for bridge maintenance.&#13;
&#13;

5.   In order to secure the sustainability of the BMS, its establishment, development and&#13;
implementation shall be carried out in three phases over a three-year period. The first&#13;
phase will consist in the development and testing of a basic BMS version. The second&#13;
phase would examine the results achieved in the first phase and should further develop the&#13;
BMS with specific modules. The third and last phase will consist of a thorough quality&#13;
control of the BMS and carry out minor modifications required.&#13;
D.   SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
PHASE I&#13;
6.    Initial Activities.  The first Consultants' activity should be an analysis and&#13;
detailed work plan of the proposed BMS. The Consultants will also assist GRD in setting&#13;
up the BMS organization (Consultants/GRD staff) which will manage and monitor the&#13;
establishment, development, and implementation of the BMS for the estimated 1,200 (para&#13;
I above) bridges of the National Road Network. This figure shall be verified and adjusted&#13;
according to BMS plan. The Consultants will also inspect a number of representative&#13;
bridges to obtain an overview of construction practices and condition levels. Description&#13;
of all these initial activities should be contained in a draft Inception Report to be delivered&#13;
(three copies to GRD; two copies to IDA) two months after commencement of work. The&#13;
report will be reviewed and commented by GRD and IDA within a month after delivery of&#13;
its draft version. Estimated Consultant manpower: 2 man-month (m/m).&#13;
7.    Organizational Setup. On the basis of the likely development of the road sector&#13;
administration in Albania, the Consultants should clarify the present organization and&#13;
specify the setup for the BMS organization in GRD. This task, to be completed one month&#13;
after approval of the Inception Report, is estimated to require 2 m/m of Consultants'&#13;
services.&#13;
8.    BMS Analysis and Program Specification. The BMS to be delivered will be&#13;
specifically in accordance with Albanian condition. It will be based, preferably, on an&#13;
existing BMS already developed and proven in a national road network with similar&#13;
characteristics to the Albanian network. The first BMS phase would establish modules for&#13;
inventory, principal inspection, ranking of repair works, and budget and cost control. GRD&#13;
counterpart staff will receive (in the field and classroom) training in carrying out the&#13;
principal inspections supervised by the Consultants. The output shall be a BMS capable to&#13;
rank bridge repair works on the basis of principal inspections. The estimated Consultants'&#13;
manpower is 7m/m.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-84-&#13;
Annex 3.7&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
9.    Bridge Maintenance Plan. The Consultants will assist GRD in setting up the&#13;
bridge maintenance plan based on the Phase I of the BMS. The plan will rank the repair&#13;
works matching the budget for the next fiscal year. Consultants' manpower is estimated at&#13;
2 m/m.&#13;
PHASE II&#13;
10.   Adjustment of Bridge Management System. Once GRD has gained experience&#13;
following Phase I of the BMS, the Consultants shall provide modules to improve BMS&#13;
results and GRD work on bridge management. The Consultants shall prepare the&#13;
specifications for the software modules and shall assist GRD in the procurement of&#13;
equipment required. The following actions should be implemented (i) Optimization&#13;
Module, (ii) Repair Catalogue, (iii) Remedial Works, (iv) Routes for Special Transports,&#13;
(v) Archive System, and (vi) Special Inspections. The Special Inspections, at least&#13;
initially, would be carried out by specialized expert(s). Training to GRD staff will be&#13;
included as part of the Training Program Component under the National Roads Project.&#13;
11.   The output of Phase II will be a BMS capable of optimizing resources spent on&#13;
bridge maintenance, and to identify the best routes for special transports on the NRN.&#13;
Consultants manpower estimate: 16 m/m.&#13;
PHASE III&#13;
12.   The third and last phase consists of an overall control of the BMS. The Consultants&#13;
will assess the organization, data collection and updating procedures, and application&#13;
programs, and will also define minor modifications and further activities required for the&#13;
best operation of the established BMS. Phase III will be carried out twelve months after&#13;
completion of Phase II and would require 2m/m of Consultants' manpower.&#13;
E.    TRAINING, MANUALS, AND FINAL REPORT&#13;
13.   GRD staff shall be trained by the Consultants in the field and through classroom&#13;
lecturing. A plan for the training (in a mere cost estimate way) is part of the overall&#13;
training component of the National Roads Project. However, a plan for training, with&#13;
specific targets to be achieved, must form part of Consultants' proposal.&#13;
14.   During the implementation of the BMS, GRD staff will participate in the writing of&#13;
BMS user manuals under the lead and full responsibility, for their correctness, of the&#13;
Consultants. GRD would be responsible for the translation into Albanian of the original&#13;
English versions.&#13;
&#13;

Page 4 of 4&#13;
15.   At the end of Phase III, the Consultants shall prepare a draft Final Report&#13;
summarizing the whole BMS establishment process in GRD, and describing BMS main&#13;
components and operational characteristics. The draft (five copies to GRD; two copies to&#13;
IDA) should be reviewed and commented by GRD and IDA within the next month after its&#13;
delivery. Subsequently, GRD's and IDA's comments should be included in the final&#13;
version of the report.&#13;
16.   The Draft Final Report will include a list of GRD identified trainees explaining&#13;
type of proficiency achieved in the use and operation of the BMS and its differences with&#13;
the training plan proposed in para. 13 above.&#13;
F.    ESTIMATED MANPOWER&#13;
17.   Consultants' estimated manpower, as detailed through above T.O.R., amounts to 31&#13;
m/m. The Consultants' proposal should include an estimate of the local manpower (in rn/m&#13;
and in qualifications) required in GRD.&#13;

NATIONAL ROADS PROJECT&#13;
Project Coordinator&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
A.   INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND&#13;
1.    The National Roads Project will operate through a four-year implementation period&#13;
(1997-2000) of construction and will provide for rehabilitation (including 12.0 km Miloti-&#13;
Lezha of new construction with two important bridges) of about 90.1 km of national roads&#13;
in the East-West and Northern Corridors. In addition, it will assist in the development of&#13;
the National Road Maintenance and Safety Programs dispersed over the national road&#13;
network (3,221 km) in the seven new Region Roads Directorates (RRDs: Diber, Fier,&#13;
Gjirokaster, Korce, Kukes, Shkoder and Tirana), in the establishment of a Road Data Bank,&#13;
and a Pavement and a Bridge Management Systems, and in the development and&#13;
modernization of the technical and managerial capabilities of the General Roads&#13;
Directorate (GRD), and of the emerging private construction and consulting industries.&#13;
2.    Road works will be undertaken under FIDIC organization with the GRD as the&#13;
"Employer," international consultants in collaboration with local engineers/consultants&#13;
acting as the "Engineer," providing adaptive designs, if required, and construction&#13;
supervision, and private contractors responsible for detailed implementation. The whole&#13;
project construction period will include about six construction sites and related contracts&#13;
varying from about US$1.0 million to about US$10.0 million per contract. It is expected&#13;
that one supervision consultants team would be required for the six East-West and&#13;
Northern Corridors road works contracts.&#13;
3.    Successful implementation of the project requires understanding of its vast scope,&#13;
including the large works sites and numerous contractors to be involved, and the wide&#13;
range of objectives of the project. All this will be addressed by providing a Project&#13;
Coordinator, using an experienced international consultant and commencing with a six-&#13;
month inception phase immediately following approval of the project scheduled in June&#13;
1996. During the inception phase, the Project Coordinator will prepare and coordinate the&#13;
physical implementation of the project, which is scheduled to start in January 1997,&#13;
focusing on the execution of road works, including the prequalification and bidding&#13;
processes for the selection of contractors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-87-&#13;
Annex 3.8&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
4.    On the basis of the above, the Project Coordinator will be an international&#13;
consultant with wide knowledge and experience in project management and procurement.&#13;
The duration of services would be 54 months.&#13;
B.    OBJECTIVES&#13;
5.    The Project Coordinator will provide a single channel of command for the project&#13;
to ensure that an up-to-date focus of knowledge and managerial experience is available for&#13;
appropriate planning, financial monitoring and progress reporting to the Government of&#13;
Albania (GOA) departments, to the World Bank (IDA), and to other project donors. The&#13;
Project Coordinator will expand GRD's capacity to manage the project, whilst remaining&#13;
within GRD's established structure. An important responsibility of the Project Coordinator&#13;
is to ensure that the funds provided are utilized so as to maintain the proper balance&#13;
between project beneficiaries and maximize overall benefits.&#13;
C.  SCOPE OF WORK&#13;
6.    The Project Coordinator will be responsible to the GRD's Director General through&#13;
the chief of the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) Executive Secretariat (of which the&#13;
Project Coordinator is a member) established in the GRD Foreign Aid Department. He will&#13;
be supported by professional/supporting staff and the specialists of other departments&#13;
within GRD, and he will work closely with, and receive support from, the international&#13;
consultants in charge of the supervision of road works. He will be required to work for a&#13;
period of 54 months (para 4 above), and during the six first months of this period he will&#13;
act with reduced support. His main responsibilities during this period will be organization&#13;
of the project, and selection of the required project support. The main tasks of the Project&#13;
Coordination are described below.&#13;
7.    Project Coordination.  The Project Coordinator, through the PIU, will be&#13;
responsible for liaison between GRD and other Government ministries, departments and&#13;
district authorities, with IDA, and project cofinanciers, and with the international&#13;
consultants. He will ensure that an official, practical and efficient liaison is maintained&#13;
with other responsible entities for Government programs, in particular the management of&#13;
the other road works in the Northern, East-West, and Southern Corridors, and those&#13;
involved in the Road Safety and Training Programs.&#13;
8.    Planning and Budgeting of Works. The Project Coordinator will be responsible&#13;
for the development of annual work plans, as required by the IDA. He will provide&#13;
detailed plans for implementation and ensure that the GRD, the consultants and any other&#13;
project-related bodies are fully involved and provide all required basic information. He will&#13;
coordinate preparation of the project budget, and ensure that any administrative procedure&#13;
for both budget, preparation and expenditures are in compliance with prevailing Govern-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-88-&#13;
Annex 3.8&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
ment and IDA regulations.&#13;
9.    Resource Allocation and Release of Funds. The project budget will be contained&#13;
in the investment budget for roads of the Ministry of Construction and Tourism (MCT) but&#13;
will be clearly separable since the IDA credit and cofinanciers' participations (Italy,&#13;
PHARE, Kuwait Fund-KF, and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development-&#13;
EBRD) will flow through a special account operated at a commercial bank in Tirana. The&#13;
Project Coordinator will be expected to:&#13;
(i)   provide documented submission of withdrawal applications to IDA and&#13;
other cofinanciers to permit this account to be replenished in time to ensure that payments&#13;
to contractors are not delayed, and that the progress of works and services are adhered to;&#13;
and&#13;
(ii)  arrange provision of letters of credit to pernit the consultants to undertake&#13;
the international procurement required by the project, and to make payments to the&#13;
consultants in accordance with their contract.&#13;
10.   Selection of International Consultants Services and Equipment Required for&#13;
the Project. An early and urgent task of the Project Coordinator will be to advance the&#13;
selection, and negotiation/award of contract to the international engineering (supervision of&#13;
works) consultants team. Following this award, he will provide assistance to the&#13;
consultants in all matters connected with relations with Government, and ensure maximum&#13;
utilization of the consultants in accordance with consultants' Termns of Reference.&#13;
11.   He will assist the consultants in defining items requiring international procurement,&#13;
including vehicles and equipment for use by GOA personnel and the consultants during the&#13;
implementation of the project. He will arrange letters of credit following IDA approval of&#13;
these items, and create and maintain an assets register for all Government equipment and&#13;
goods procured under the project.&#13;
12.  Issue of Guidelines for and Finalization of Pre-qualification and Bidding&#13;
Documents. The Project Coordinator is responsible for the rapid and correct appointment&#13;
of contractors. He will, with the supervision consultants, finalize the pre-qualification and&#13;
bidding documents, after issuance of related procedures in accordance with IDA&#13;
guidelines. He will provide the advice and support required such that GRD is able to&#13;
rapidly and effectively undertake the above pre-qualification and bidding processes.&#13;

Annex 3.8&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
D.   REPORTING, MONITORING OF PROGRESS, QUALITY AND&#13;
FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE&#13;
13.   Reporting. The efficient disbursement of project funds to the Government of&#13;
Albania by the IDA and cofinanciers depends upon proper reporting to them of physical&#13;
progress, development of institutions, quality of works, and financial performance. It is the&#13;
responsibility of the Project Coordinator to provide such reporting on time, and to meet the&#13;
content requirements as may be required from time to time by IDA.&#13;
14.   Monitoring. The Project Coordinator wilf be responsible for providing financial&#13;
monitoring of all expenditures under the credit and for requesting such assistance from the&#13;
consultants and the GRD to ensure this occurs. This includes, among other requirements,&#13;
quarterly and annual progress and financial reports to the GOA, IDA, and cofinanciers, in&#13;
accordance with their reporting requirements.&#13;
15.   Quality Performance. The Project Coordinator will also provide comprehensive&#13;
information on rehabilitation and new construction works, including the extent of work&#13;
progress, labor involvement, work quality and payments due and made to contractors, and&#13;
the overall situation. He will include progress reports on institutional developments,&#13;
including consultant and contractor support and performance of consultants, and Regional&#13;
Road Directorates (RRDs) staff, including any improvement (or desimprovement)&#13;
introduced in road maintenance and road safety. He will provide copies of any amended&#13;
design proposals, consultants construction manuals and road performance studies. The&#13;
basic monitoring framework will be as provided in the Annex 3.11, Project Monitoring&#13;
Indicators, but will be supplemented and, if required, improved in cooperation with the&#13;
consultants.&#13;
16.   Financial Performance. Another responsibility of the Project Coordinator will be&#13;
to prepare and provide to GOA, IDA, and cofinanciers, monthly statements on all financial&#13;
records including (i) withdrawals from IDA credit, Italy, PHARE, EBRD and GOA's&#13;
participation with copies of disbursement requests and related documentation, (ii) records&#13;
of transactions of the Project account including copies of bank statements and balances,&#13;
and (iii) information on any outstanding claims to IDA and to the Project by contractors or&#13;
arising from procurement.&#13;
E.   TECHNICAL SERVICES TO GRD&#13;
17.   The Project Coordinator will provide to GRD any details of technical standards&#13;
required, results of any technical audits such as evaluation of gravel, bitumen or concrete,&#13;
which have not been conducted locally, and, in general, information of any important&#13;
aspect of the project.&#13;

ALBANIA&#13;
NATIONAL ROADS PROJECT&#13;
Technical Assistance and Training Program&#13;
for GRD and RRDs Staffs&#13;
TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
A.    INTRODUCTION&#13;
I.    The last three years, in consonance with a successful macroeconomic stabilization&#13;
of the Albanian economy, have witnessed an extreme growth of traffic - more than&#13;
sevenfold in five years - which is expected to continue for several years. The results are&#13;
infrastructure bottlenecks which restrict ongoing development, increase the deterioration of&#13;
the road network, and present a major impediment to the development of the Albanian&#13;
private sector and to direct foreign investment. Traffic accidents are a serious problem,&#13;
and environmental issues resulting from an extremely rapid traffic increase will become&#13;
severe if no adequate action is taken in time.&#13;
2.    To meet the above impediments to sustainable development, the National Roads&#13;
Project has been established with the main purpose to overcome key infrastructure&#13;
bottlenecks, improve the maintenance and safety of the National Roads Network (NRN),&#13;
and train the General Roads Directorate (GRD) and Region Roads Directorates (RRDs)&#13;
staffs to improve management and operation of the road sector. A vital component of the&#13;
National Roads Project is the Technical Assistance (TA) and Training Program, reaching&#13;
most of the road managerial and operational aspects, and the subject of the present Terms&#13;
of Reference (T.O.R.).&#13;
B.    OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.    The objectives of the TA and Training Program are to:&#13;
(i) provide skills and attitudes to the General Roads Directorate (GRD) and its&#13;
Regional Road Directorates (RRD) executives to manage the needed&#13;
organizational adjustments required by the National Roads Project and the&#13;
modernization of the Road sector;&#13;
(ii) enable GRD to design, implement, and apply a Road Data Bank, a Pavement&#13;
Management System, and a Bridge Management System;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-92-&#13;
Annex 3.9&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
(iii) strengthen GRD's and RRDs' staffs, as well as domestic private consultants'&#13;
and contractors' management skills on maintenance and construction projects&#13;
under competitive bidding;&#13;
(iv) improve GRD's and RRDs' capability in project management, planning,&#13;
monitoring, budgeting and accounting;&#13;
(v) strengthen GRD and RRDs staff skills on Environmental and Road Safety&#13;
issues for planning, managing and supervising road projects;&#13;
(vi) improve skills of technicians and road workers on vehicles, on equipment, and&#13;
on rehabilitation and maintenance of road works;&#13;
(vii) establish training programs in cooperation with the University of Tirana,&#13;
Faculty of Civil Engineering, Ministry of Transport, Ministry of Interior, and the&#13;
Ministry of Construction and Tourism to ensure the required improvement of the&#13;
general educational level on Road Administration and Maintenance; and&#13;
(viii) establish close bilateral relations between road managers, engineers and&#13;
economists in Albania with those from close related countries.&#13;
C.   TWINNING&#13;
4.     The road work force in Albania is competent in traditional road disciplines,&#13;
however, the isolation of Albania for more than forty years and lack of interaction with&#13;
foreign organizations has strongly reduced its capability. Training is urgently required in&#13;
modem management systems, economics, environment, safety, legal, and practically in all&#13;
modem technological developments. The need of TA and training at all road sector levels&#13;
calls for a Twinning Arrangement between a mature Road Administration - preferably&#13;
Westem European with similar country and road network size to Albania - and GRD and&#13;
RRDs. This will permit the creation of a strong technical platform within GRD and&#13;
subsequent benefits for the entire Albanian road sector. We estimate 50 m/m of GRD staff&#13;
training, at&#13;
US$2,000 per m/m or US$100,000.&#13;
D.   ACTIVITIES&#13;
5.    The following activities, led to achieving the above objectives, will be carried out&#13;
under the National Roads Project by the selected Consultants:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-93-&#13;
Annex 3.9&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
(a) Management Training in GRD and RRDs. The organizational changes and&#13;
application of maintenance management systems require a severe strengthening of GRD&#13;
and RRDs executive staff capability. A first phase will identify, through a Training Needs&#13;
Assessment, the performance gaps of executive staff, and on these bases, would design&#13;
individual training programs.  A period of training abroad should be included for&#13;
familization of the, in general, high level staff of the courses, with the Western road&#13;
administration standards. We estimate 2 m/m of Consultants' lecturing at US$20,000 per&#13;
m/m or US$40,000; and 40 m/m of executive staff training at US$5,000 per m/m or&#13;
US$200,000.&#13;
(b) Training of Maintenance Engineers, Systems and Planning Experts. The&#13;
application and operation of a Road Data Bank (RDB), a Pavement Management System&#13;
(PMS), and a Bridge Management System (BMS), are important elements of Road&#13;
Management, and of the National Roads Project. GRD capability on the management of&#13;
the issues relating to the systems as (i) data collection for RDB, (ii) visual inspection for&#13;
PMS and BMS, (iii) inventory, (iv) routine and special bridge inspections, (v) repair&#13;
methods, (vi) operation of every system, and (vii) quality control, would require training&#13;
for the groups working with and using the systems. We estimate 10 m/m of Consultants'&#13;
lecturing at US$20,000 per m/rn or US$200,000; and 200 rn/m of staff training at&#13;
US$2,000 per rn/m or US$400,000.&#13;
(c) Training in Civil Engineering.  Appropriate performance of GRD's and&#13;
RRD's staffs as that of private contractors and consultants, call for intensive training&#13;
courses matching the fast development of Albania to a market and privatized economy.&#13;
The many skills still needed are on (i) Project Management, (ii) Supervision of Works,&#13;
(iii) Cost/Benefit Analysis, (iv) Bidding Procedures, including Prequalification, (v)&#13;
Quality Control and Quality Assurance, and (vi) Laboratory Testing. We estimate I rn/m of&#13;
lecturing by Consultants at US$20,000 per m/m or US$20,000; and 20 mlm of staff&#13;
training at US$5,000 per m/m or US$100,000.&#13;
(d) Training on Road Safety and Environmental Impact Assessment. Several&#13;
laws and regulations have been passed in Albania during the last forty years relating to&#13;
road safety and environmental issues. However, enforcement has been poor, and little has&#13;
been achieved in practice. Continuation of the Road Safety Program under the National&#13;
Road Project would consider effective action mainly through the Road Safety Program&#13;
(already started under the ongoing Transport Project), and it would include provision of&#13;
equipment to the Traffic Police, and related training to achieving efficient enforcement of&#13;
traffic regulations.. Also, project designers and planners of the ministries involved and&#13;
GRD will have to carry out the Environmental Impact Assessments (EIA) required in&#13;
future road projects. This calls for development of EIA's guidelines and screening&#13;
procedures in Albania. The Road Safety and EIA requirements will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-94-&#13;
Annex 3.9&#13;
Page 4 of 5&#13;
considered under the project, and Consultants will provide special courses on Road Safety&#13;
and EIA to specific target groups of GRD, and of the National Traffic Police. We estimate&#13;
5 m/m of Consultants lecturing at US$20,000 per m/m or US$100,000; and 30 m/rn of staff&#13;
training at US$3,000 per m/m or US$90,000.&#13;
(e) Training of Technicians and Road Workers. The quality of present road&#13;
maintenance and rehabilitation works should be improved through programs prepared by&#13;
Consultants for technicians and road workers. Training on, and use of modem technology&#13;
and equipment should be emphasized, and a review and critic of present practices should&#13;
take place. After completion of training, the participants should be able to carry out all&#13;
repair road work according to modem standards. With private contracting of works&#13;
advancing in the public sector, a reduction of the about 3,500 workers in GRD and RRDs&#13;
in a medium term future is inevitable. However, a parallel increase of jobs should take&#13;
place in the private sector to absorb these jobs. In order to ensure benefits for all of them,&#13;
the program will be set up as a Training of Trainers program. In a first phase, Albanian&#13;
instructors with required language proficiency will attend the courses, and with the&#13;
knowledge acquired and the course training manuals, will run the second phase of the&#13;
training program reaching the whole work force. Intense on-site and hands-on training will&#13;
be applied in all courses. We estimate 10 m/m of Consultants for training at US$20,000 per&#13;
m/m or US$200,000.&#13;
(f) Educational Activities with University of Tirana (UT). The National Roads&#13;
Project presents important and interesting opportunities to transfer know-how and to&#13;
provide practical experience to future road staff. To ensure a sustainable development of&#13;
the general educational level in Albania and to ensure cohesion between the road sector&#13;
and the institutions providing employees to the sector, the Consultants will ensure that&#13;
essential knowledge transferred to GRD and RRDs (new construction techniques, modem&#13;
equipment, new laboratories, implementation of a Road Data Bank, a Pavement&#13;
Management System, and a Bridge Management System) is also available to UT's students&#13;
of Civil Engineering and staff from the Ministry of Transport. The Consultants shall&#13;
outline a specific plan on how to benefit these specific groups from the TA and training&#13;
provided under the National Roads Project. These activities are part of the project and&#13;
should not imply any extra cost than that-of providing assistance to GRD.&#13;
(g) Bilateral Cooperation. Besides the Twinning Program (para. 4 above) as the&#13;
most important bilateral cooperation under the TA and Training Program, the Consultants&#13;
should also look at the additional bilateral cooperation opportunities which are available.&#13;
Since GRD is adopting Italian design standards, transfer of experience from Italy (e.g.,&#13;
through the Italian Association of Road Engineers) to Albania could be a relevant subject&#13;
of the TA and Training Program. We estimate a lump sum of US$100,000 for this item.&#13;

E.   SCHEDULE AND REPORTING&#13;
6.    The services under the present T.O.R. should be provided within the 48 month&#13;
duration period of the project. The experts to be supplied by the Consultants will be&#13;
mostly based in Albania. Particular attention should be paid to the compatibility of service&#13;
duties and training requirements among GRD and RRDs staffs. Fulfillment of staff&#13;
services should take priority over training.&#13;
7.    The Consultants firm (s) for each 5 (a) through 5 (g) activity will report to GRD&#13;
(five report copies) and to IDA (two copies), in English, as follows (i) Inception Report,&#13;
with an overall training needs assessment and an update of the initially proposed plan,&#13;
three months after mobilization, (ii) for each subcomponent (i.e., activity), a Progress&#13;
Report every six months after issue of the Inception Report, on the timely planned due&#13;
date, (iii) Draft Final Report, including an Executive Summary, for each subcomponent on&#13;
the timely planned completion date, and (iv) Final Report, for each subcomponent,&#13;
incorporating comments of GRD and IDA on the respective Draft Final Report, within one&#13;
month after delivery of the Draft Final Report.&#13;
18.   Tne Draft Final Report will include, as an important part of the report, a summary&#13;
of the problems encountered, issues raised, and targets achieved including the efficiency&#13;
(in qualification and quantitative terms) of the training provided to GRD and RRDs staffs&#13;
in each activity of the program. The identification of every trainee, training followed, and&#13;
results achieved should appear in the Final Report duly explained and justified.&#13;
F.  ESTIMATED MANPOWER AND BUDGET&#13;
19.   The Consultants total estimate manpower, as detailed through the above text, is 28&#13;
in/m of Consultants and 340 m/m of staff (GRD and RRDs) training. The total planned&#13;
TA and Training Program cost should not exceed US$0.5 million for the TA Consultants'&#13;
component, and US$ 1.0 million for the Training component.&#13;

ALBANIA&#13;
NATIONAL ROADS PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Assessment Summary&#13;
1.    Background&#13;
1.    The improvement of the National Roads Network is an important&#13;
component of the government of Albania's Investment Plan. It is also the basis for&#13;
the proposed "Road Network Development Strategy of Development in the&#13;
Republic of Albania," August 1995. The project components proposed for World&#13;
Bank funding include the rehabilitation of national roads in the Northern and the&#13;
East-West Corridors, namely:&#13;
a)    Elbasan to Qafe Thane (71.1 km)&#13;
a)    Tapize-Fushe Kruja, 7.0 km and&#13;
b)    New section Miloti-Lezha (12.0 km)&#13;
d)    Two bridges over the Matit (650 m) and Drin (200 m) bridges&#13;
2.    According to World Bank Operational Directives 4.01, as the project&#13;
involves the construction of new roads, it is rated category "A", requiring the&#13;
borrower to prepare an environmental impact assessment (EIA). The purpose of the&#13;
EIA is to improve decision making and to ensure that project options are&#13;
environmentally sound and sustainable. ElAs also identify ways to improve projects&#13;
environmentally and socially by preventing, minimizing or mitigating adverse&#13;
impacts.&#13;
3.    The General Roads Directorate  (GRD),   using  ICP  consultants&#13;
(Albanian/Italian joint venture) prepared the Environmental Assessment Report for&#13;
the Miloti-Lezha road. After reviewing the report, World Bank specialist visited&#13;
Albania to assist ICP in strengthening the report to satisfy Bank guidelines. The EIA&#13;
for the Milot-Lezha road has since been revised and submitted to the Bank. GRD is&#13;
still working on the environmental assessment of sections along the Elbasan-&#13;
Progadec corridor.&#13;
4.    The initial EIA report prepared by ICP required strengthening in the&#13;
following areas: (i) description of the environmental policy, (ii) legal and&#13;
institutional framework (iii) preparation of mitigation, management and monitoring&#13;
plan, (iv) identification of training needs (v) approx. costs for the mitigation&#13;
measures, monitoring and training components and (vi) responsibilities for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

implementation. The summary of the revised report for Milot-Lezha prepared by&#13;
ICP on behalf of GRD is given below. The report is in two volumes and are&#13;
available on request.&#13;
II.   National Environmental Policy and Legal Framework&#13;
5.    Albania has made good progress during the past 2-3 years towards the&#13;
formulation of an environmental strategy and policy and a system of protection and&#13;
management of the environment. The first environmental strategy study was&#13;
prepared in 1993 in cooperation with the World Bank and formned the basis for the&#13;
National Environmental Action Plan which was approved by the Government in&#13;
January 1994.&#13;
6.    The national policy of Albania to protect the environment comes under Law&#13;
No 7664, dated January 21, 1993.  The law establishes the Committee for&#13;
Environmental Protection and Preservation (CEP) under the Ministry of Health&#13;
(MOH) as the authority to implement the national environmental policy. CEP is&#13;
headed by a chairperson and has three main departments: Water and Air; Forestry;&#13;
and Environmental Economics, each headed by a Director. Twelve regional offices&#13;
of CEP are located in capital towns of each of the national districts. At present,&#13;
capacity within CEP is limited and will need strengthening especially in the areas of&#13;
environmental impact assessment, environmental monitoring and enforcement.&#13;
7.    Environmental Impact Assessment is a major component of the Law 7664.&#13;
Chapter II, Articles 8 and 9 spell out the requirements for an EIA and the authorities&#13;
responsible (CEP and MOH) for the implementation of the law. Articles 12 and 15&#13;
also highlight the public disclosure requirements during the EIA process. Another&#13;
recent legislation, Law 7848, dated 25 July, 1994 relates to social impacts. The law&#13;
addresses the rights of the citizens to appeal expropriation of private land and&#13;
demand fair compensation.&#13;
III.  Identification  of Environmental Impacts and    Proposed&#13;
Mitigation   Measures&#13;
8.    Soil&#13;
Impacts: The proposed realignments along Tirana -Vora and the new road&#13;
at Milot -Lezh mainly cross agricultural land and potential impacts will&#13;
include soil erosion, unstable slopes, side-tipping of spoil material which&#13;
could encroach on adjoining agricultural land and soil contamination due to&#13;
road runoffs.&#13;

Annex 3.14&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
Mitigation: The road passes for most part, through flat plains and impacts&#13;
due to unstable slopes will be limited. Exposed soil on the embankments&#13;
will be revegetated using the top soil taken from the excavations. Soil&#13;
contamination due to road runoffs will be mitigated by the use of side&#13;
drains.&#13;
9.    Water&#13;
Impacts: As the new road passes over two rivers, there is the possibility of&#13;
polluting both the Mat and Drin rivers. If the water is not properly drained it&#13;
could contaminate the adjoining agricultural lands. Direct impacts from&#13;
motor vehicles could be solid particulates (from corrosion, wear and tear of&#13;
tires, road surface, etc.). lead, organic compounds (grease, lubricating oils).&#13;
Accidental spillage of hazardous substances could present the most&#13;
dangerous impact to the surface and ground water, especially the Mat and&#13;
Drin rivers. Furthermore, road construction is likely to change existing water&#13;
drainage patterns - causing flooding or water stagnation. The widening of&#13;
the road along the Tirana-Vore section, could result in the contamination of&#13;
the adjoining green houses due to road runoffs.&#13;
Mitigation: Road runoffs will be collected by drainage systems and the&#13;
speed of the polluted water will be reduced by increasing the turfing of the&#13;
embankment slopes. Water drainage patterns would be modified so that the&#13;
polluted runoffs do not run into irrigation channels. Its proposed to design&#13;
the road drainage channels at a lower elevation than the adjoining irrigation&#13;
channels to prevent cross contamination. In the case of the Mat and Drin&#13;
rivers provisions will be made to collect the road runoff through side pipes&#13;
and will be then dispersed through infiltration pits on either side of the&#13;
bridge. Furthermore Reno type mattress and gabions are to be used in the&#13;
embankments for the protection of the rivers from soil erosion of the river&#13;
banks. Realignments and widening of the road in the Tirana-Vora, Tapize-&#13;
Fushe and Elbasan sections also generate similar impacts as construction of&#13;
new roads and hence mitigation measures will need implementing along the&#13;
lines described above.&#13;
10.   Air&#13;
Impacts: The road route avoids populated areas and hence impacts due to air&#13;
pollution will be limited. However the road does pass close to few farm&#13;
houses and a village school (at Milot) located less than 50 meters from the&#13;
highway.&#13;
Mitigation: It is envisioned that measures will target both site specific and&#13;
policy issues at the national level to control air pollution in the highway&#13;
sector. Site specific measures include using vegetation screens to filter TSPs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

and dust from the road traffic. It also proposed to elevate the road close to&#13;
the school and provide an underpass for safe access and protection against&#13;
related impacts such as air and noise pollution. No new quarries are planned&#13;
and construction material will come form existing quarries which are&#13;
situated outside the project area and no major impacts are foreseen.&#13;
Additionally, new quarries and asphalt plants will be required to have dust&#13;
reduction measures such as bag houses, mechanical cyclones, etc. At the&#13;
national level the Government of Albania is moving towards the use of&#13;
unleaded gasoline and has recently provided price incentives to promote&#13;
unleaded gasoline.&#13;
11.   Flora and Fauna&#13;
Impacts. The roads for the most part, pass through agricultural land and the&#13;
impacts on the flora and fauna will not be as severe as passing through&#13;
virgin forests. Nevertheless, the lack of knowledge of the existing flora and&#13;
fauna in the area may contribute to possible negative impacts on some rare&#13;
species. Furthermore the construction activity and storage of materials and&#13;
the construction of access roads could affect the flora and fauna in the&#13;
adjoining areas.&#13;
Mitigation: Providing safe animal crossings (provision of underpasses&#13;
connecting both sides of the roads, fencing in sensitive areas ) is envisaged.&#13;
Underpasses are designed at an interval of 3 km along the road, this design&#13;
criteria will be revisited, and if necessary, the number of underpasses will be&#13;
increased depending on the height of the highway and the groundwater&#13;
level. Drainage ditches of 1.5 to 2 m deep on either side of the road will be&#13;
a further deterrent to trespassing. In regards to assessment of flora, fauna and&#13;
biodiversity, the Committee for Environmental Protection and Preservation&#13;
will work closely with GRD to identify sensitive areas where additional&#13;
measures for the protection will be taken.&#13;
12.   Noise&#13;
Impacts. As the proposed road does not pass through populated areas, the&#13;
extent of noise pollution will be limited to few farm houses and a village&#13;
school in Milot which are closer than 100 meters from the axis of the&#13;
highway. The noise levels generated   from  fairly busy highway&#13;
(7500/veh/day) will be in the order of 60 to 90 decibels (dbA). Noise levels&#13;
over 55 (dbA) could be disruptive. The farm houses and school located less&#13;
than 50 meters from the highway could be subjected to noise pollution in the&#13;
future. The quarries and crushers during the construction phase could also be&#13;
a source of noise pollution if located close to residential areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-109-&#13;
Annex 3.14&#13;
Page 5 of 8&#13;
Mitigation. Mitigation measures could be taken in pavement design and&#13;
maintenance of the road such as using graded asphalt and avoidance of&#13;
surface dressing close to sensitive areas. Other measures will include the&#13;
construction of embankments/barriers and mounds to suppress the noise&#13;
pollution close to houses and schools. The barriers proposed will be a&#13;
combination of mud barriers and restricted dampers such as shrubs and&#13;
bushes. Furthermore, according to design drawings the location of the road&#13;
at a higher elevation, close to the school, would contribute to dampening the&#13;
noise pollution.&#13;
13.   Land Acquisition and Resettlement&#13;
Impacts:     There will be no instances of destruction of dwellings, or any&#13;
major resettlement involved in the proposed project. The roads mostly pass&#13;
through agricultural lands which are not all under active cultivation. The&#13;
area which would be occupied for the new road in the Milot-Lezha section is&#13;
around 27 hectares, however, the surface area lost to agriculture is approx.&#13;
12 hectares.&#13;
Mitigation:   The Albanian Government is implementing legislation on&#13;
expropriation of land and related compensation issues. Law 7848 on "&#13;
Expropriation for Public Purposes and Temporary Use of Immovable&#13;
Property and Law 7698 for " Requesting and Compensating Former Owner&#13;
Property" will ensure that impacts derived from expropriation are handled&#13;
fairly. According to Article 14 of Law no 7848, " Immovable property is&#13;
compensated by the entity for the full market value, in favor of the entity for&#13;
whom expropriation is being carried out". In addition to compensation, site&#13;
visits showed that the farmers and other stakeholders are supportive of the&#13;
road project because they feel the project will contribute to their well being&#13;
and provide them with better business opportunities to sell their produce.&#13;
14.   Cultural Heritage&#13;
Impacts: Damages to historical and cultural sites are possible during road&#13;
construction and related works such as development of quarries and burrow&#13;
pits. Road construction could also damage the atheistics of cultural and&#13;
archeological monuments.&#13;
Mitigation: Preliminary investigations do not foresee any impacts&#13;
on cultural and archeological sites. The archeological sites of Kruja are&#13;
located far away from the Tapize - Fushe rehabilitation component. However,&#13;
further investigations of inventories of cultural and historical sites along with&#13;
bibliographic searches will be necessary. GRD will work closely with&#13;
Committee of Environmental and the Ministry of Culture to check for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-1 10-&#13;
Annex 3.14&#13;
Page 6 of 8&#13;
possible impacts of the proposed route on cultural and historical monuments.&#13;
If the road does pass close to cultural and historical monuments then the&#13;
contracting agencies should be made aware of safety precautions to be taken&#13;
with regards to proper disclosure and protection of sites and artifacts.&#13;
15.   Road Safety&#13;
Impacts: Traffic has risen more than ten fold in Albania over the last five&#13;
years and with it the potential for traffic accidents which will become a&#13;
major public health problem for the country. New roads will help in&#13;
reducing accidents, but increase in speeds results in more fatalities. In&#13;
addition to road user safety, construction workers at site are also at the risk&#13;
of accidents.&#13;
Mitigation.    Analysis of traffic accidents is essential for the development&#13;
of mitigation measures. Information on the number of deaths , injuries, and&#13;
location of the accidents are used to identify road black spots where physical&#13;
road safety improvements will have maximum impact in reducing the&#13;
number of accidents. The road safety components proposed in the project will&#13;
address road safety issues. Mitigation measures will include traffic signs,&#13;
markings, proper intersection layout, presence of road barriers such as trees,&#13;
poles, walls. Policy issues such as speed limits, and vehicle inspections&#13;
contribute to reduction in traffic accidents.  Furthermore, measures to&#13;
promote worker safety in the road construction needs to be addressed. Safety&#13;
measures including wearing of helmets, signs to reduce speed in worker&#13;
areas, etc. In addition to a separate safety component in the project, EU will&#13;
be also providing grant funding for national road safety measures.&#13;
IV.   Rehabilitation Works&#13;
16.  In general, road rehabilitation works generate positive environmental&#13;
impacts, such as reduction in road accidents, erosion and flooding control, noise&#13;
reduction. In addition, they provide opportunities to further improve the&#13;
environment. The indirect impacts generated through rehabilitation mainly relate to&#13;
construction activities involving quarries, concrete and asphalt plants which could&#13;
result in air and noise pollution if not properly located and controlled. Apart from&#13;
taking mitigation measures against soil, water and air pollution, as described above,&#13;
tender documents and worker contracts would be provided with environmental&#13;
clauses related to: origin of quarry material, location of borrow sites, pollution&#13;
control in quarries and asphalt plants, location of worker camps, storage, handling&#13;
and disposal of hazardous wastes, occupational safety issues for workers. Portions&#13;
of the rehabilitation works do involve broadening of roads (Tirana-Vora) and&#13;
&#13;

correcting alignments and building small new bridges (Elbasan-Progradec sections).&#13;
Environmental studies for the realignment sections of the Elbasan-Progradec&#13;
sections are being prepared and will be submitted to the Bank by end of March,&#13;
1996.&#13;
V.   Environmental Training:&#13;
17.  The Committee for Environmental Protection and Preservation (CEP) will be&#13;
the central authority on environmental policy and monitoring issues. However,&#13;
environmental capacity should also be built in the sectoral ministries, which are&#13;
ultimately responsible for implementing environmental mitigation measures. Hence&#13;
it is proposed to establish a small unit in the GRD to address environmental issues&#13;
from transport projects. It is envisioned that the TA component would assist the&#13;
establishment of the unit to prepare and implement appropriate environmental&#13;
management plans for the highway sector. Training will be required in&#13;
environmental management, preparation and review of EIAs, social assessments,&#13;
environmental health assessments. and environmental economics. Funds have&#13;
already been identified in the project for training as shown in the cost tables.&#13;
VI. Implementing and Monitoring of Mitigation Measures&#13;
18.  The Italian Partners of ICP will be in charge of designing the environmental&#13;
mitigation measures in close cooperation with CEP. Additionally tender documents&#13;
produced will include the environmental mitigation measures proposed. The&#13;
supervision and monitoring of the proposed mitigation measures will be the&#13;
responsibility of CEP and GRD.&#13;

            by rehabilitating and constructing national roads; 2)
            improve the maintenance and safety of national roads; 3)
            promote the development of the local contracting and
            consulting industries; and 4) train the General Roads
            Directorate's (GRD) staff and develop strong
            cooperation between GRD's staff and activities and the
            University of Tirana (UT). The project will include the
            following components: 1) rehabilitation and construction of
            national roads; 2) road maintenance and safety equipment and
            materials; 3) supervision of road works; 4) establishment of
