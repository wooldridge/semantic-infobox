ALBANIA&#13;
AGRO-PROCESSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
CREDIT AND PROJECT SUMMARY&#13;
Borrower:          Government of Albania (GOA).&#13;
Executing&#13;
Agencies:          Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MAF) and the Rural Commercial Bank (RCB).&#13;
Beneficiaries:     Private Agriculture Entrepreneurs, Farmers and Farmers' Associations.&#13;
Credit Amount:    SDR 4.1 million (US$6.0 million equivalent).&#13;
Terms:             Forty years with a ten year grace period, at standard IDA charge.&#13;
Objectives:        To support the development of the agro-processing sector and to help improve the&#13;
conditions for financing its restructuring through the financial sector in order to&#13;
improve marketing of farm outputs (thereby improving rural incomes) and&#13;
availability of food products to the urban consumer.&#13;
Description:       The proposed project consists of Investment Credit and Entrepreneurs Support&#13;
components. The Investment component would provide a line of credit for&#13;
onlending by the RCB, at market rates, to the private agriculture enterprises,&#13;
farmers and farmers associations for long-term (and permanent working capital)&#13;
loans.&#13;
The Entrepreneurs Support component would assist agro-processing enterprises but&#13;
would focus on the dairy industry and would include relevant assistance to the RCB&#13;
for the appraisal and supervision of sub-projects. The project would provide funds&#13;
for experts and related expenses for: (i) long and short term experts in various&#13;
fields; (ii) direct technical assistance and training/study tours to entrepreneurs (and&#13;
their associations) in agro-processing, organization of private farmers associations,&#13;
processing, quality assurance, management, marketing and other business aspects;&#13;
and (iii) limited assistance to local institutions to strengthen their technical services&#13;
and quality control law enforcement capabilities.&#13;
Environmental&#13;
Aspects:          This project has been assigned a category "B" environmental rating. Although this&#13;
rating indicates the possibility of specific environmental impacts with regards to&#13;
discharges from agro-processing plants, the project is expected to result in an&#13;
overall improvement in the environment. The Independent Lending Unit (ILU) of&#13;
the RCB would review each sub-project for compliance with Albanian&#13;
Environmental legislation and World Bank Environmental guidelines. During&#13;
implementation, mechanisms would be established to monitor effluent standards.&#13;
Benefits:          The project would contribute several benefits to the Albanian economy. It would&#13;
help restructuring of agro-processing enterprises. It is expected to help put into&#13;
place a market access to farmers to sell milk and other farm products thereby&#13;
reducing their wastage and encouraging improved farm production thus help&#13;
increasing rural incomes. The urban consumers would benefit from the supplies of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(ii)&#13;
quality food products. It would make strides in institution-building and improving&#13;
entrepreneurship and human capital through training and technical support. Since&#13;
the dairy sector contributes as much as 10% to the nation's GDP the project could&#13;
have a significant impact on the Albanian economy.&#13;
Risks:              The project would carry significant risks. Given weak institutional capacity, the&#13;
implementation may be slow; this risk would be mitigated by the use of foreign&#13;
experts with Albanian professionals by engaging an experienced foreign firm. The&#13;
demand for processed products may be less; this risk is considered low given that&#13;
processed products are still scarce in Albania so that a substantial part of the&#13;
demand is not being met at present. The private entrepreneurs may be reluctant&#13;
to borrow loans at market rates; discussions with private and public sector entities&#13;
have revealed strong interest in loans as there is a shortage of long-term investment&#13;
funds. The other major risk would be institutional capacity of the RCB to be able&#13;
to service loans and monitor their performance; this risk is being addressed under&#13;
the ASAC project through the provision of appropriate technical assistance to the&#13;
ILU/RCB; the proposed project also includes technical assistance to the ILU. The&#13;
ASAC and EFSAC projects are dealing with the issue of restructuring/privatization&#13;
of the RCB. Other potential risk relates to the possibility of regional hostilities.&#13;

AGRO-PROCESSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
1. AGRICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK SECTOR&#13;
A.    Agricultural Situation&#13;
1.1    With almost two thirds of the Albanian population of 3.2 million residing in the rural areas, more&#13;
than half of the total economically active population is employed in the agricultural sector. A large part&#13;
of the industrial sector, which used to employ about 25 percent of the economically active population,&#13;
concerned the food processing industry, which was largely dependent on the primary agricultural sector.&#13;
This industry has completely collapsed since 1989. Due to the slow growth of employment in the&#13;
industry and services sectors, in the past the policv of the Government was to retain surplus labor in the&#13;
agricultural sector.&#13;
1.2    Before 1990, there were no private farmers, 75 percent of the rural population was dependent&#13;
on cooperative farms for its living while the remaining 25 percent worked on state farms. With the&#13;
collapse of the collective production system, the land and the cattle were divided amongst the workers&#13;
of the cooperatives and state farms, and the rural families have become private farm families. Most of&#13;
the land previously controlled by the cooperatives (75 percent of arable land) and state farms (25 percent&#13;
of arable land) has been privatized, creating about 492,000 very small private farms each with 0.8 to&#13;
3.3 hectares of land (average 1.43 ha), the majority of which has one or two cows (Annex 1.1); some&#13;
30,000 rural families are without land. There is an overpopulation of farmers and thus large&#13;
underemployment persists in the sector.&#13;
1.3   In the past, an important objective of the Government was the achievement of food self-&#13;
sufficiency in the major staple crops. With input and output marketing controlled by the state, and prices&#13;
and subsidies set by the state in a way that bore no relation to costs, huge inefficiencies in production&#13;
were maintained. The result was self-sufficiency at a high cost. After the collapse of the centralized&#13;
agricultural production system agricultural production first declined, the result of farmers inability to&#13;
cultivate all fields during a fairly chaotic land distribution process. With land distribution almost&#13;
complete, agricultural production is increasing, however, shortages of inputs and absence of adequate&#13;
collection, marketing and processing systems remain serious constraints. While Albania is no longer&#13;
dependent on food-aid imports, it is far from attaining its former status as a net food exporter.&#13;
1.4   Farmers Micro Environment. The newly privatized farmers are now focusing on subsistence&#13;
farming, with some surplus available to the market, mainly to generate cash for the purchase of other&#13;
essential commodities. Most farms produce both crop and other products, with wheat and maize still the&#13;
main crops despite a marked shift in land use. Production of industrial crops has fallen, due to the&#13;
inability to process crop products. Meat and milk are presently the main products sold through town&#13;
markets. Wheat would also gain importance as an income source as production rises. Cattle and other&#13;
livestock were distributed together with the land resulting in farmers consigning to fodder crop - mostly&#13;
alfalfa - that portion of their land surplus to grain self-sufficiency requirement. Many farmers are now&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
increasing their livestock holdings; however, feed supply remains a major constraint to improved&#13;
livestock productivity. Farm fragmentation and the breakup of the mechanization network has led to&#13;
some increase in the use of traction power. Farmers are finding it difficult to market products due to lack&#13;
of adequate marketing and processing facilities. Annex 1.2 presents some key characteristics of the&#13;
present small farmer production system in Albania.&#13;
B.    Livestock Production&#13;
1.5    Livestock is an important sector in the Albanian economy accounting for about half of the GDP&#13;
added by the agricultural sector. The production of milk, mainly from cows, but also from sheep and&#13;
goats, has always been the principal focus of livestock production, while meat was seen mainly as a by-&#13;
product of the dairy sector. In 1989, milk accounted for 43 percent of the value of livestock products&#13;
(of this 20 percent was from sheep and goats) and meat for 31 percent. Free market forces however, are&#13;
likely to change this relationship where meat production represented between 38 and 48 percent of gross&#13;
value of production.&#13;
1.6   In 1994, the cattle population was estimated at 743,500 head (Annex 1.3), of which 400,300 or&#13;
54 percent were milking cows as compared to 640,000 head in 1991, (306,000 milking cows), an increase&#13;
of 16 percent. The rising level of breeding females in the national cattle herd also indicates the priority&#13;
farmers give to milk production and suggests the early turnoff of progeny for meat, probably at sub-&#13;
optimal weights. In 1992 cattle population was estimated at only 566,000 head (of which 324,000&#13;
milking cows). This initial fall in cattle numbers was probably the result of small holder capitalization&#13;
through slaughter of stock acquired following the distribution of formerly cooperative-owned herds,&#13;
combined with a particularly severe feed shortage during the 1991/92 winter. The strong growth&#13;
thereafter was aided by a good summer fodder season in 1993 and a mild 1993/94 winter and the&#13;
continuing control of most diseases. In 1994, the sheep population of 2.01 million included 1.48 million&#13;
ewes (74%), and has already increased by more than 18 percent over the 1991 population, as has the goat&#13;
population of some 1.39 million (up 16% over the 1991 level) which includes 1.01 million milking goats&#13;
or 73 percent of the total population. The growing small ruminant population is likely the result of&#13;
smallholder farmer access to previously under-utilized hill-side grazing. Meat, formerly produced in&#13;
specialized industrial estates in the case of pigs and poultry, and food lots with cattle, is now mostly in&#13;
the mixed smallholder farming sector with offtake at much lower ages and liveweights (12-18 months and&#13;
180-250 kg for cattle) due to the feed deficit.&#13;
1.7    Livestock is now entirely privately held. While most of the 492,000 private farms have&#13;
livestock, the number per farm remains very small. According to the 1993 livestock statistics, 35 percent&#13;
of the farms do not have a (milking) cow, 58 percent of the farms has one cow, while only 7 percent&#13;
(representing about 27,000 farms) has more than one cow. The overall average of 0.73 cows per farm&#13;
varies little between the plains (0.74) and the mountainous districts (0.70). Some 60 percent of all farms&#13;
has at least one sheep and 45 percent at least one goat. The number of farms with more than 10 (adult&#13;
female) sheep or goats is very limited, with 9 percent of the farms having more than 10 ewes and 8&#13;
percent with more than 10 milking goats. The milking sheep and goat population average of 4.80 per&#13;
farm, varies from 4.04 in the plains to 6.29 per farm in the mountainous districts, reflecting the better&#13;
access to natural pasture grazing lands in the uplands. Given the rate of growth in the sheep and goat&#13;
populations - already over 10 percent since 1991 - the development of systems to sustainable exploit&#13;
natural grazing lands would be critical to the development of the small ruminant sub-sector. The plains&#13;
districts, including the coastal districts and Korca/Devoll, with 72 percent of the total population and 73&#13;
percent of the arable area, has 68 percent of the total number of milking cows, about 60 percent of the&#13;
milking sheep and 50 percent of the milking goats.&#13;

1.8    Milk Yield. Average milk yield on the cooperative farms used to be quite low (about 1,250 kg);&#13;
the situation on the state farms was better with an average annual yield of 2,750 kg. The overall 1989&#13;
figure was 1,470 kg and has&#13;
risen by 6 percent to 1,560 in&#13;
1994.  Government  estimates&#13;
show cow milk yields ranging                  Table 1.1 Average NiLk Yield in 1994&#13;

annual sheep milk yields ranging&#13;
from  33-56 kg and goat yields          Source: Albania: Agriculture and Food Statistics, 1994&#13;
from 71-98 kg. It is not clear&#13;
whether these yields represent&#13;
total production or marketable&#13;
product after allowance for&#13;
rearing of progeny. While there is a large spread in cow milk yields between plains and mountainous&#13;
districts CTable 1.1), reflecting the greater dependence of cattle on cultivated fodder, the spread for sheep&#13;
and goats is far less, the latter species showing similar yields in mountainous and plains areas. Milk&#13;
production by district is provided in Annex 1.4.&#13;
1.9    Animal Feed. Until the breakdown of the collective system, Government policy was to be self-&#13;
supporting for both crop and livestock products, even with a rapidly increasing population. This has&#13;
resulted in an increasing competition for land between food and feed production, resulting in shortages&#13;
of roughage and animal feed. Livestock on the small private farms is now being better taken care of than&#13;
the cattle on the cooperative farms in the past, as is reflected in the increasing average milk yields.&#13;
Overall, the production of roughage has increased, while maize silage as the major feed for the winter&#13;
season has been replaced by alfalfa hay (lucerne). Nevertheless, shortage of animal feed is still wide-&#13;
spread, including a shortage of minerals. It is expected that the demand for concentrates would grow in&#13;
the medium term, depending on the price ratio between milk and concentrate feed. In addition, some&#13;
dairy by-products (whey and skim milk) could be used for animal feeding. There are 9 feed mills in&#13;
Albania, each with a capacity of 3.5 tons per hour, all located in the plains districts. However, most feed&#13;
mills are closed and those working producing only feed mixes for monogastric production. About 70&#13;
percent of the ingredients used are produced locally (mainly wheat and maize), the rest is imported&#13;
(mainly soya, fish meal). There is a shortage of locally produced protein rich ingredients; by-products&#13;
of the agricultural food processing industry are no longer available after the breakdown of this industry.&#13;
To become operational again, the feed mills would require investment for rehabilitation and spare parts&#13;
together with new technology such as feed pelleting.&#13;
C.    Agriculture Services&#13;
1.10   Extension Service.  Each district now has a Department of Agriculture and Food with&#13;
responsibilities in the areas of agricultural policy development at district level and the development of&#13;
extension services in the communes. In each commune there is group of specialists, composed of an&#13;
agronomist, a zoo technician, a veterinary inspector, an economist and a statistician, responsible for the&#13;
collection of data from the farmers and for the delivery of extension services. Although a field service&#13;
structure has thus been put in place at the district and commune levels, the actual delivery of extension&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
services yet need to be fully developed. The specialists gathered in the MAF field service have all been&#13;
trained to work as specialists on large scale state and cooperative farms; they need to gain the experience&#13;
and the general knowledge required to advise small farmers on how to improve production on a mixed&#13;
farm and in a market economy. In this respect, the development of applied research required for the&#13;
formulation of suitable extension messages is a priority area. In a number of pilot activities (e.g., the&#13;
Netherlands supported project, "Agricultural Development in Fier District", and British assistance to the&#13;
MAF) some first steps are presently being taken in defining small farmers' needs regarding technical&#13;
advise and investigating adequate response to these needs. These projects focus on an integrated approach&#13;
to farm development including simultaneous improvement of crop and livestock productivity (horizontal&#13;
integration) and at the same time improvement of input supply and marketing of agricultural produce&#13;
(vertical integration).&#13;
1.11   Agricultural Research. The agricultural research structure under the MAF consists of several&#13;
Agricultural Research Institutes and Stations covering all major sub-sectors in agricultural production,&#13;
including cereals, vegetables, livestock and forestry. This structure still requires major adjustments in&#13;
order to be able to respond to the demands of the market economy and the present small farmer&#13;
production situation. The institutes are generally poorly equipped and have insufficiently trained staff&#13;
to cope with the required changes. There would most likely be a reduction in the number of institutes&#13;
once a new research structure and programs have been defined. The institutes responsible for the&#13;
development of food processing, enforcement of food quality control laws, etc., are the Institute of&#13;
Veterinary Research (IVR), Institute of Public Health (IPH), Food Research Institute (IKU), and&#13;
Agricultural and Food Design Institute (IPBU). The proposed project would support limited upgrading&#13;
of the facilities of such institutions.&#13;
1.12   Veterinary Services.  The Directorate of Veterinary Services presently employs some 400&#13;
permanent professional staff deployed at national, district and municipal level. With the Director and&#13;
only three staff at the headquarters office - responsible respectively for veterinary services, inspection and&#13;
epizootiological information - the service is heavily decentralized. Each district level MAF office has&#13;
an Animal Health Sector, staffed by a complement of 3-4 veterinarians responsible for epizootiology and&#13;
inspection of food and animal feed. In addition, a diagnostic veterinarian and a veterinary technician are&#13;
employed in each of the 26 district veterinary laboratories which presently provide diagnostic services&#13;
to the farmers without charge. This district team supports a cadre of veterinarians located at the 360&#13;
communes. At this level, veterinary staff are semi-private practitioners receiving a portion of their salary&#13;
for the implementation of disease control and public health activities defined under the veterinary law:&#13;
mainly vaccination and meat inspection. Animal treatment is on a fee basis for service and drugs. In&#13;
Tirana, the Institute of Veterinary Research is the main academic institution dealing with veterinary&#13;
services.&#13;
1.13 Artificial Insemination. The only field services actually responding directly to farmers' needs&#13;
are the veterinary service and the artificial insemination (Al) service, operating at the village level.&#13;
Farmers are also willing to pay for these services, but do complain about the cost. The Al service which&#13;
presently operates with 285 private inseminators, urgently requires equipments (since long foreseen to&#13;
be supplied with Italian aid) to function adequately at some 700 Al points and using frozen semen only.&#13;
Al coverage has decreased from 70 percent in 1989 to less than 40 percent now. Semen doses are now&#13;
Lek 60/straw and insemination charges range from Lek 150-300. The Italian authorities are considering&#13;
a program to provide assistance for the strengthening of extension, veterinary and AI services.&#13;

II. AGRO-PROCESSING SECTOR&#13;
A.    Overview of the Sector&#13;
2.1    Albania's production of processed food expanded rapidly in the 1950's and 1960's as investments&#13;
in the food processing industry grew and agricultural production and imports from the Former Soviet&#13;
Union provided needed raw materials. In the 1970s the industry became more self-sufficient and&#13;
experienced growth rates similar to agricultural production in the range of 2 to 12 percent for most&#13;
products. In the early 1980s, production of key commodities such as bread fell below the population&#13;
growth rate and the production of sugar and oil experienced negative annual growth rates of 8 and 2&#13;
percent respectively.  During the second half of the decade, bread production kept just ahead of&#13;
population growth, while sugar production stagnated and food oil production declined at an annual rate&#13;
of 6 percent. By 1990, the Government's ability to produce bread, sugar and oils with domestic&#13;
production fell significantly. The anticipated increased in bread, sugar and oil production also remain&#13;
dependent upon the ability of the food processing enterprises to attract domestic production and survive&#13;
without government financial support.&#13;
2.2   In the past, Albania's food policy was based on establishing at least one processing facility in each&#13;
district for each subsector, ignoring economies of scale. The enterprises were only responsible for&#13;
processing, as securing raw materials and marketing were handled by other state enterprises. The&#13;
industry was directed by the Ministry of Food, which is now part of the Ministry of Agriculture and&#13;
Food. Most of the technology is obsolete, as there has been almost no investment, even for necessary&#13;
spares, for 20 years and only the creativity and skills of Albanian mechanical engineers have kept&#13;
factories operating. Production efficiency and product quality are very low, and even minimum hygienic&#13;
and sanitation standards are not met.&#13;
2.3    The agro-industrial sector includes about 200 large mostly state enterprises, about 400 private&#13;
small scale dairies, about 100 private small scale sausage plants and several hundred rural bakeries. In&#13;
1993, the sector employed about 20,000 workers. Output fell dramatically after 1990. Most state food&#13;
processing enterprises have been partially or totally closed since 1990/91. Some continue to operate at&#13;
only a fraction of their capacity. Privatization of the plants is a first step towards revitalization of the&#13;
industry, and this process needs to be expedited.  There are several obstacles constraining the&#13;
privatization process, one of which concerns the relatively high prices demanded for the existing buildings&#13;
and installations, which in most cases are old, with outmoded production technologies. At the same time,&#13;
potential buyers often consider the processing capacities of the existing plants too large, and generally&#13;
prefer smaller processing units. To restart production, they need to organize the collection of sufficient&#13;
quantities of inputs (milk, vegetables, fruits, meat, etc.), which is not an easy task considering the very&#13;
small size of the many production units and farms. Further, packaging/bottling of the end products is&#13;
often problematic due to a complete lack of the required materials and production facilities. In addition,&#13;
marketing channels need to be developed for the sale of the end products. While there is quite substantial&#13;
entrepreneurial interest in the agro-processing sector, several factors are hindering its development.&#13;
These include: lack of adequate business management and marketing skills, lack of exposure to modern&#13;
technology and operational techniques, lack of equity capital required by the banks for borrowing, and&#13;
lack of credit and collateral property. The proposed project would address many of these constraints by&#13;
providing training, advice and credit to private agricultural entrepreneurs.&#13;
2.4    The level of literacy in Albania is quite high and a large number of people were trained in skills&#13;
in order to play a crucial role in the centrally controlled manufacturing system. However, there is a lack&#13;
of exposure to modern industrial skills throughout the sector. Most of the personnel employed in the&#13;
agro-processing industry are quire knowledgeable but lack comprehensive technical education. Some have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
attended short courses after high school and learned the job through on-the-job training as there are no&#13;
diploma courses in the field of agro-processing. This lack of modern technical skills shows in the poor&#13;
processing and efficiency of operations. Given past heavily state controlled system, the management and&#13;
business, (e.g., accounting, financial analysis, marketing, MIS, etc.) skills are lacking. There is a need&#13;
to develop comprehensive training programs to upgrade basic technical, and management and business&#13;
skills. In the beginning, some of this training should be offered at external institutions and by foreign&#13;
experts in Albania. At the same time, steps should be taken to develop such capacity within Albania&#13;
including development of short-term as well as diploma courses on various aspects of agro-processing&#13;
sector.  The proposed project would provide limited assistance to local technical institutions for&#13;
developing such capability.&#13;
B.    Meat Processing&#13;
2.5    Most of the 28 state owned slaughter houses now operate at a much reduced level compared to&#13;
1991 and before, if operating at all. A significant number of cattle and small ruminants is now&#13;
slaughtered on-farm without any veterinary control. Some meat on the hoof is also exported informally&#13;
to Yugoslavia and to Greece. The state slaughter houses depend on the municipalities without central&#13;
control from MAF. With the exception of those in Tirana, Vlore, Fier, Durres and Korca, the slaughter&#13;
houses are very old with no investment in recent years; generally, they are completely obsolete. The&#13;
specialized poultry slaughter house is now closed. Large scale poultry, egg and pig production has&#13;
stopped entirely in 1991, as has beef fattening in the former central large scale feed lots.  Meat&#13;
production is now only on small scale private farm level, with rural village slaughters and consumption&#13;
of the produced meat mainly in the rural areas.&#13;
2.6    Sausage production. The meat processing industry has been taken over by private entrepreneurs&#13;
who have started their own small sausage production plants. There are presently over 100 small plants&#13;
with a capacity ranging from 100-300 kg of sausage per day. There are also some larger industrial&#13;
enterprises, including one in Tirana where with private Italian investment a factory with a capacity of&#13;
2,500-3,000 kg of sausage per day has been established. There is no government control on the estab-&#13;
lishment and operation of the new plants. MAF is only globally aware of what is going on in this sector,&#13;
and has no control, for example, on hygienic conditions, quality control, etc. Many of the new plants&#13;
are operated by meat processing specialists who used to work in state meat processing enterprises. Only&#13;
a few of the 14 state meat processing enterprises have been privatized. For most of the remaining state&#13;
plants there is probably no future, even if they were to be privatized. Most of them can hardly be&#13;
considered proper plants - their entire installations, cold storage rooms, etc. are defunct - only the build-&#13;
ings remain, but these are generally old and not suitable for rehabilitation. The new meat processing&#13;
plants operate predominantly using imported meat (Italian, Danish, etc.). A new plant requires modest&#13;
investments in machinery and equipments for meat processing; the average investment in a new small&#13;
plant is $8, - $10,000 for a meat mincing machine, a small packing machine and an autoclave.&#13;
C.    Flour Mills and Pasta Factories&#13;
2.7    Wheat production. The national production of wheat has again increased considerably after an&#13;
initial drop following the distribution of land to the small private farms in 1991 and 1992/93. In 1990&#13;
wheat was cultivated on 203,000 ha of land, down to only 103,000 ha in 1992, but increasing to 170,000&#13;
ha in 1994. Wheat production decreased from 613,000 tons in 1990 to 252,000 tons in 1992 but&#13;
increasing to 415,000 tons in 1994. The dry summer is not the only reason for the lower yields; also&#13;
the lack of availability of irrigation, continuous cropping of wheat without rotation and a lower use of&#13;
fertilizer and other inputs are contributing factors to decrease in yields. Farmers produce wheat primarily&#13;
for their own needs; they store the required wheat at home and market only a small surplus, if available.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
It is estimated that not more than 20% of the produced wheat is marketed. Total national requirement&#13;
of wheat is about 700,000 tons per year. To fill the gap between national production and requirement,&#13;
210,000 tons of food-aid wheat was imported in 1993 together with 88,000 ton of food-aid flour and&#13;
80,000 ton of commercial flour. Continued imports of wheat and flour will be necessary to fulfil the&#13;
demand.&#13;
2.8    Flour mils. Albania's 42 flour mills have capacities ranging from 10 to 150 tons of wheat per&#13;
day. The total (original) installed capacity of these mills is about 1,500 tons per day. The technical&#13;
condition of most of the mills is very poor. Only three mills (Lushnje, Shkoder and Tirana) have&#13;
reasonable installations, less than 15 years old. In a second mill in Tirana the Government has invested&#13;
$1.5 million in German machinery in 1990; this is the only modern mill, with a processing capacity of&#13;
60 tons of wheat per day. Eleven of the mills have closed, while the remaining mills produce between&#13;
2 and 25 tons of flour per day for urban demand. Only 8 are privatized so far, while most of the other&#13;
ones are in the process of privatization. Twenty-four of the 42 mills have reasonable to good quality&#13;
buildings and could (from this point of view) qualify for rehabilitation, with investment in new technical&#13;
installations. However, the total required milling capacity is now much lower than before.&#13;
2.9    Total flour production in the 42 large (state) mills was 320,000 tons in 1992, down to 136,000&#13;
tons in 1994. Food-aid has permitted the mills to continue to supply urban bakeries, although they were&#13;
unable to meet the demand from the several hundred rural bakeries. The private grain milling and baking&#13;
sector grew rapidly since 1992; almost every&#13;
village has a private entrepreneur milling grain,&#13;
baking bread, or both. Village and town mills&#13;
vary from those using simple technology (small    Table 2.2 Number of Fruit Trees and&#13;
stone grinding mills) to relatively sophisticated          Total Production&#13;
mills that have been taken over by private parties.&#13;
Most of the 80 former state owned bakeries have&#13;
been privatized. There are now about 500 private               N uber of Trees   Production&#13;
bakeries in the towns and cities.                                               n,Ioo to")&#13;
2.10   Pasta factories.   There are 10 old                       1990   1994   1990  1994&#13;
factories with a capacity ranging between 5 and    Fruit Trees  13032   5140    71   52&#13;
10 tons of pasta.  Most of the factories have      Olive Trees   5821   2931      10   32&#13;
citrus Treea9    1084    383  10   13&#13;
Italian machines (presses), dating from 1972/73    Pergola       5587   3262    65   34&#13;
and 1982/83. Only 2 of the pasta factories are     Vineyard     17261   5056    91   55&#13;
privatized (one in Durres and one in Korca). Of                       a F       -  19-&#13;
the state pasta factories 3 have been closed, and 5  Source: Albania: Agriculture and Food Stistics, 1994&#13;
are still operating, producing between 2 and 8&#13;
tons of pasta per day (Annex 2.1). The local&#13;
pasta is somewhat cheaper than the imported&#13;
pasta, but is of a lower quality.&#13;
D.    Vegetables and Fruit Processing&#13;
2.11   There were 31 vegetable and fruit canneries spread all over Albania. Only three plants have been&#13;
privatized so far; these are the only ones still operating. In general the processing technology is very old,&#13;
involving a great deal of simple hand work. The few existing equipments are now obsolete. Packaging&#13;
and labelling of the end products is very problematic (lack of bottles, no cans, etc.). Among the best&#13;
plants is the state owned orange fruit concentrate plant in Sarande, with relatively new machinery (1985-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
90) from the former Eastern Germany, with a processing capacity of 4 tons of oranges per hour. How-&#13;
ever, this plant is presently closed. There are seven canneries for the production of jam and stewed fruits&#13;
having relatively new equipments; Peshkopia, Kavaja (privatized), Shkoder, Tirana, Skrapar (privatized),&#13;
Vlore and Berat (privatized). The other 23 plants are of little value any more. Some of the buildings&#13;
are good and could continue to be used for vegetable or fruit processing, but as the old installations can&#13;
be removed very easily, they could also be used for other purposes. One of the major problems facing&#13;
restart of the industry is the organization of collection of fruits and vegetables from small farmers.&#13;
2.12   An important field of cannery industry in Albania used to be the tomato sauce industry with 13&#13;
plants. Twelve of these plants are closed since 1991. The plants in Elbasan and Shkodra have relatively&#13;
new machinery (1985-88) with a processing capacity of 200 tons of tomatoes per day. The plants in&#13;
Shijak (near Durres), Fier and Vlore have a similar capacity, with machinery from the 1970s. The other&#13;
8 plants (in Delvina, Korca, Kavaja, Lac, Lezhe, Berati, Kukes and Permet) have very old installations,&#13;
each with a capacity of 40 tons of tomatoes per day. In the past 80% of the production was exported to&#13;
Eastern Europe.&#13;
E.    Vegetable Oils&#13;
2.13   There are 14 plants for olive oil production, four of which are equipped with modern&#13;
installations. These four plants are joint ventures with Italian (Elbasan, Tirana), Greek (Vlore) and&#13;
German (Sasoy - Sarande) companies. The daily oil production capacity of the Sarande factory is 40&#13;
tons, Vlore 36 tons, Elbasan 20 tons and Tirana 6 tons. The other 11 plants are equipped with old&#13;
(Russian) lines and machineries, for pressing olive pulp, cotton seed and sunflower pulp. There are 10&#13;
sunflower oil refinery units, 3 of which have been privatized. Only one plant in Fier has modern German&#13;
extraction equipment (1989), the others have old oil presses which are generally obsolete. Operation is&#13;
seasonal; some of the plants started working in September/October 1994 with crude sunflower oil&#13;
imported from the United States. Edible oil bottling is normally done at town and district bottling plants.&#13;
2.14   The national requirement of vegetable oils (mainly sunflower oil) is estimated at about 40,000&#13;
tons per year, of which about one-third is presently covered by national production. The national&#13;
production of soaps presently covers approximately 40 percent of the total demand of about 18,000 to&#13;
20,000 tons per year. In 1994, 11,000 tons of crude sunflower oil was imported from the United States.&#13;
Further (commercial) imports are refined sunflower oil mainly from Bulgaria, Italy and Turkey; laundry&#13;
soap from Turkey; toilet soap, detergents and shampoos mainly from Turkey and Italy, etc. Local&#13;
production of soaps continues in three enterprises (two joint ventures in Elbasan and Vlore), the fourth&#13;
one in Shkodra has closed.&#13;
F.    Alcoholic and Non-alcoholic Beverages&#13;
2.15   Other enterprises in the food industry include 22 wineries with a total capacity of 170,000&#13;
hectoliters (hl), some distilleries and 3 beer production enterprises. The beer breweries are in Tirana&#13;
(capacity 180,000 hl per year), in Korca (55,000 hl) and in Vlore (60,000 hl). The brewery in Korca&#13;
is private, both others are state owned. The brewery in Vlore is closed because of financial difficulties.&#13;
In Tirana brewery the European Community has recently financed investments of 1.5 million ECU (and&#13;
7 million Lek by the GOA). This factory has restarted production in 1994. Total beer production in&#13;
1993 was around 5,000 hl, a fraction of the total 1990 production of 187,000 hi. Imported beer is now&#13;
dominant in the market.&#13;
2.16   Presently only six wineries (5 private) are operating -- Durres (state), Librazhd, Leskovik, Peshk-&#13;
opi, Lushnje and Berati. Investment requirements relate to bottling lines and washing machinery, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
Wine bottles have been imported from Bulgaria (beer bottles from Germany, plastic bottles from Greece).&#13;
Total wine production has decreased from 35,000 he in 1990 to 9,000 hi in 1993. More than 20 percent&#13;
of the national wine production of 66,000 hl in 1989 was exported. One of the problems now in this&#13;
industry is the collection of grapes from private producers. More than half of the total acreage of&#13;
vineyards has been destroyed following the privatization in 1991. The grapes produced are now mainly&#13;
used for home consumption. The wineries of Durres, Peshkopi, Korca and Tirana have distillation col-&#13;
umns for the production of brandy and cognac. In all of the 22 wineries, uzo, vodka, fernet, ponce and&#13;
liquors of different types could be produced. At present, there are numerous very small private (home)&#13;
distilleries.&#13;
2.17   In Korca there are two sugar factories (constructed in 1951 and 1976), with a total capacity of&#13;
1,800 to 2,000 tons of sugar beet per day. These plants are now closed. Sugar beet production has&#13;
declined from 169,000 tons in 1990 to 27,000 tons in 1993. The problem is the same as for other&#13;
industrial crops such as sunflower, soya, cotton, etc.; the farmers have reduced the acreage cultivated&#13;
with these crops because of the difficulties encountered in the marketing of sugar beets.&#13;
III. DAIRY SUB-SECTOR&#13;
A.    Milk Production and Supply&#13;
3.1    Total milk production in 1994&#13;
is estimated at 780,000 tons, an                    Table 3.1 Milk Produc: 1960-93&#13;

small rural cheese processing plants&#13;
and for calf rearing. The state farms,&#13;
especially in the plains districts used&#13;
to produce milk required to meet urban demand; 85 percent of milk required for Tirana was supplied by&#13;
the state farms. Due to a peak in the number of calving in spring, the monthly supply of milk to the&#13;
dairies in April, May and June used to be about three times as high as it was in the period from&#13;
November to February. On the present small private farms, the concentration of calving in spring has&#13;
increased; thus an even greater portion of milk is now being produced in the period between April and&#13;
June.&#13;

3.2    Milk Collection. Together with the disintegration of the collective production system, the state&#13;
run milk collection system also collapsed in 1990/91 and the alternative systems have not yet developed.&#13;
In the past, milk collection, mainly from the state farms and the cooperatives, used to be well organized,&#13;
especially in the plains districts, with a network of collection points for the delivery of milk to the dairy&#13;
plants in the urban centers. The collection centers generally lacked cooling facilities. Milk was collected&#13;
twice - or even three times per day - depending on the frequency of milking per day - with trucks (also&#13;
without cooling) belonging to the dairy plants. Milk collection in the mountain districts was organized&#13;
differently, due to the bad quality -or even absence - of roads and the limited possibilities to transport&#13;
milk quickly.&#13;
B.    Milk Processing&#13;
3.3    There are 18 state owned medium to large scale dairy plants located in the larger cities, 14 of&#13;
which are in the plains districts (Annex 3.1). In addition, there are 7 smaller milk processing plants each&#13;
with a capacity of 5 to 10 tons of milk per day. The large plants, in Tirana, Berat, Lushnje, Fier,&#13;
Durres and Shkoder each have a capacity of around 50 tons per day. In Tirana a new plant (70 tons) was&#13;
under construction since 1986 to replace the old plant. However, the German Aid Agency (GTZ) is&#13;
installing a new plant utilizing some equipment of this plant. Tirana also has a cheese factory (capacity&#13;
20 tons of milk per day), which was normally open only during those months of the year with high&#13;
production of milk (spring and early summer). In addition, Italian equipment for a baby food plant (700&#13;
tons of baby food) arrived in Tirana in 1993 and is awaiting installation near the Food Complex in&#13;
Tirana.&#13;
3.4   In general, the dairy plants were built 15-20 years ago with East European (and Chinese)&#13;
technology. The technology used in most of the dairy plants is old and inefficient. Most plants are in&#13;
poor condition resulting from the lack of proper maintenance in the past and recent acts of vandalism.&#13;
Non-availability of spare parts and other inputs, and collapse of milk collection system and perhaps&#13;
decline in demand due to lack of disposable income, have resulted in either the closure or very low level&#13;
of operations for most large and medium dairy plants. The plants in Tirana and Lezhe were closed in&#13;
1992. The other plants then continued working, but most of them at a level of not more than 5 to 10%&#13;
of their installed capacity, processing only I to 2 tons of milk per day (Annex 3.2). In the course of&#13;
1993 and the beginning of 1994, most of the remaining factories were also closed. Currently none of&#13;
the factories produce pasteurized milk any more, although this had been the main objective of the larger&#13;
plants in the past and should again in future be the main aim. Only the small plants in Elbasan (Cerik)&#13;
and Korca (Belisht) have been privatized to date, the one in Belisht operating at its maximum capacity&#13;
of 10 tons of milk per day, producing cheese.&#13;
3.5    Rural Cheese Plants. There were 565 small rural cheese plants with the capacity of I to 1.5 tons&#13;
of milk per day, most of which were located in the mountain districts. While a number of these cheese&#13;
plants have been destroyed by the previous land owners, most of them have now been privatized and are&#13;
producing cheese during the months of March until late August/September. In addition to these plants,&#13;
recently some new (small) cheese plants have come into existence. At present, there are around 400&#13;
small private cheese plants, some of them processing as much as 2.5 to 3.0 tons of milk per day into&#13;
white (soft) cheese; a number of them also make yoghurt and ice cream.&#13;
C.    Product Distribution&#13;
3.6    The supply of pasteurized milk to the urban consumers stopped in the beginning of 1992 when&#13;
the dairy plants shifted to the production of cheese as this was then more profitable. On the other hand,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- II -&#13;
the private farmers are experiencing severe constraints in marketing their milk. As a result, more milk&#13;
is now being consumed in the rural areas than in the past when production for the urban population was&#13;
a priority. Although it is difficult to get an accurate assessment of the level of milk now being distributed&#13;
by the farmers themselves as fresh milk or as cheese in the streets of the towns and cities, it is estimated&#13;
that the present level of fresh milk supply to the cities is around 50-60 tons per day. The urban&#13;
population (about 1.16 million), received an estimated 70 percent of the bottled milk and milk products&#13;
produced, or about 270 kg milk equivalent per capita. In 1993, only about 20 percent of the milk&#13;
produced, some 130,000 tons, reached the market system in the form of feta cheese, cottage cheese or&#13;
unpasteurized milk in plastic soft-drink bottles. The informal supply of milk to the urban areas is at&#13;
present handled by the milk producing farmers themselves and partly by the traders buying feta cheese&#13;
from a number of small rural cheese processing plants. The liquid milk and the cottage cheese (fresh&#13;
products) are mainly sold by farm family members and goes to the city markets for sale during the day.&#13;
Transportation is by bus, bicycle or lift by some trucks. The cost and time consumed in transportation&#13;
limit the area from which fresh products can be sold, normally farm supply comes from an area within&#13;
15-20 km from the city markets.&#13;
3.7   It is clear that distribution of the milk and other end products to the urban centers in the past has&#13;
not been given proper attention. Therefore, this function would need to be especially organized which&#13;
should include establishment of selling points in the urban centers. This activity could be carried out by&#13;
the different parties, such as, processing plants, private vendors, cooperative organizations and shop&#13;
traders.  Appropriate investments in distribution infrastructure, such as delivery vehicles, storage&#13;
facilities, training of marketing personnel, attractive packaging, advertising, and consumer education&#13;
would need to be given proper attention.&#13;
D.    Product Quality&#13;
3.8   In Albania, the quality of food commodities in general and that of dairy products in particular&#13;
is quite poor at the market level. Milk, being highly perishable requires quick mobility to the nearest&#13;
market as a raw or pasteurized milk or converted into relatively stabilized products, such as, cheese,&#13;
yogurt, butter, milk powder, etc.. The urban consumer having been used to regular supply of pasteurized&#13;
milk and milk products of standard quality, at fixed prices, under the changed circumstances is even&#13;
prepared to accept milk of variable quality at highly fluctuating prices. In spite of this unmet market&#13;
demand, the milk and milk products marketing still remains outside the realm of commercial economy.&#13;
However, with the emergence of un-organized handling and marketing of milk and milk products, the&#13;
recently restructured government quality surveillance system is not well equipped to implement the quality&#13;
standards due to the lack of adequate infrastructure both at the sample collection and at the sample testing&#13;
levels. The responsibility for the maintenance of quality prior to political reforms rested with the&#13;
cooperation between the government implementing agencies, food producers, processors, trade and&#13;
consumer associations. The proposed project would support limited upgrading of equipment (and skills)&#13;
of selected food quality control institutions.&#13;
E.    Trade and Prices&#13;
3.9    Trade in Dairy Products. Until 1993, imports of dairy products, mainly butter and cheese, were&#13;
dominated by food-aid deliveries. Food-aid was sold by GOA at prices below wholesale prices for&#13;
domestic products, and has thus contributed to constrain market entry for newly privatized dairy factories.&#13;
The revenues generated by food-aid were credited to a counterpart fund to support fiscal budget, in&#13;
particular social safety net programs. However, there were no milk powder imports under food-aid in&#13;
1993-94. At the end of 1993, the Government decided to phase out all food-aid imports. Since demand&#13;
and supply in Albania is not balanced, and food-aid has ceased, imports of dairy products are increasingly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
handled by the private sector, focusing on cheese&#13;
and milk powder.                                    Table 3.3 Dairy Prodiiet Imports to Albania in I993&#13;
3.10   Consumer Prices.  The price of cheese         Dairy      Food Aid   Private     Total&#13;
was liberalized in early 1992 while the consumer     Product    Import    SeAtof&#13;

Milk&#13;
Powder&#13;
In Durres, one private milk collector services about&#13;
200 farmers collecting 1,500 liters daily. Milk is&#13;
colected by an un-refrigerated tanker truck at one&#13;
former state-owned collection center and several  depending on the location, and make hard cheese&#13;
district markets at a price of Lek 24 per liter. The  which is sold for prices ranging fTom 200 to 270&#13;
unpasteurized and un-refrigerated milk is sold  Lek/kgi  Private cheese imports consist primarily of&#13;
before 9 a.m. to six centers in Tirana at Lek 29 per&#13;
liter. Milk colection and delivery costs are  feta cheese from Eastern Europe, e.g., Bulgaria, and&#13;
estimated at Lek 2 per liter. This operator is  are well placed in terms of quality and price to&#13;
interested in purchasing milk cooling equipment to  satisfy local demand (no detailed breakdown is&#13;
available on costs and prices).  In 1994, butter&#13;
imports are landed at a cif cost of around US$1,350&#13;
per metric ton. Adding 5 percent import duty, US$4 per ton port handling charges, US$9-10 transport&#13;
costs to Tirana, and a 15 percent turnover tax, will price the butter at about US$1,650 per ton ex-store&#13;
Tirana. Allowing for 15 percent wholesale and retail margins and 6 percent retails sales tax, the free&#13;
market price for imported butter is likely to settle at around US$2,300 per ton. Milk powder imports&#13;
are now entirely handled by the private sector. Wholesale prices of US$1,600-1,700 per ton add weight&#13;
to anecdotal information of cif prices of only US$1,050-1,100, indicating that milk powder offered to&#13;
Albania is heavily discounted. The extremely low price likely involves products from Eastern Europe&#13;
that have approached the end of their storage life. Such imports may continue to flow into the Albanian&#13;
market in view of ineffective sanitary controls. Assuming international market prices of US$1,500 per&#13;
ton of skim milk powder and US$1,650 per ton for butterfat, 5 percent import duty, 15 percent&#13;
manufacture and retail margins, and turnover taxes on manufacture and retail sales as for butter above,&#13;
the financial price of reconstituted milk would be around 38 Lek per kg, which is about 10-20 percent&#13;
above the retail raw milk price in Tirana. It is thus unlikely that milk reconstitution (at regular milk&#13;
powder import prices) would represent a viable alternative to the use of domestically produced milk.&#13;
Furthermore, there is a strong preference in Albania for fresh and pasteurized milk compared to&#13;
reconstituted milk. At a procurement price of about 20 Lek/liter of fresh milk prevailing in early 1995,&#13;
milk factories pasteurizing and packaging fresh milk could place a product on the retail market at about&#13;
33-35 Lek per liter.&#13;
3.11   Farm Economics.  Annual net margins from a one cow milk production system in a low input&#13;
scenario on 0.75 ha of which 40% would be in fodder, would be valued at some US$118 per year,&#13;
assuming a producer price of milk of US$0.18 per kg, yielding about US$0.36 per person day. With&#13;
two cows, a larger farm size of some 1.5 ha, and relatively higher share of fodder crops, the annual net&#13;
return would be valued between US$300 and US$870, depending whether a low or high input scenario&#13;
is applied. Net return per person day would also be substantially higher in these larger and/or more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
intensively cultivated farms (Annex 3.3). Recent analysis indicated that dairy production accounts for&#13;
almost 50-60% of the farm budgets.&#13;
IV. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK&#13;
A.    Ministry of Agriculture and Food&#13;
4.1    The Ministry of Agriculture and Food (M.AF) has undergone several changes in the recent pasL.&#13;
In 1992, the former Ministry of Agriculture, responsible for agricultural production, was merged with&#13;
the Ministry of Food Processing. At present, the Minister of Agriculture and Food is supported by one&#13;
Deputy Minister. The MAF has been regrouped into eleven Departments -- Agricultural and Animal&#13;
Production, Veterinary Services, Finance and Economy, Land and Water Resources, Agro-Processing,&#13;
Food and Quality Inspection, and Statistics and Information, etc. (Annex 4.1). The General Directorate&#13;
for Forestry is also part of the MAF. Under IDA's Agricultural Sector Adjustment Credit (ASAC), an&#13;
Agricultural Program Office (APO) was established to assist MAF in the coordination of policy and&#13;
foreign assistance programs. In the current set up, the Agro-Processing Department (APD) which is&#13;
responsible for the collection and processing of agricultural products, including meat, milk and milk&#13;
products, would be the executive agency for the proposed project. In view of its limited institutional&#13;
capacity, a Technical Services Unit (TSU) has been established to provide assistance to private&#13;
entrepreneurs, farmers and farmers associations and to handle other project activities.&#13;
B.    Technical Institutions and Associations&#13;
4.2    The 1995 Food Law (para 3.9) assigns specific responsibilities for the implementation of food&#13;
quality control regulations to the Food Research Institute (IKU), and Institute of Veterinary Research&#13;
(IVR). In addition to their quality control law enforcement responsibilities, the IKU and the IVR would&#13;
continue to provide technical services to the industry along with other organizations such as the&#13;
Agriculture and Food Design Institute (IPBU) and the Albanian Dairy Association (ADA).&#13;
4.3    Food Research Institute. The IKU was established in 1962 as a constituent of the MAF and was&#13;
required to deal with the food industry on matters of processing technology, plant design, packaging,&#13;
quality standards and production schedules under the centrally controlled system. The institute has 29&#13;
technical and 14 supporting staff with long experience. The institute has begun to refocus its activities&#13;
towards providing assistance to the industry in particular training, testing, quality control, as well as&#13;
granting certificates for the registration of food manufacturing enterprises. It makes sense for the IKU&#13;
to redirect its attention to the private sector in a market economy and to evolve into an income earning&#13;
agency offering services for a fee. According to the 1995 Food Law, the IKU is a National Center of&#13;
Reference for the control of food with non-animal origin. The IKU would also train staff of the food&#13;
control authority at the field as well as Ministry levels in monitoring the industrial operations as required&#13;
under the new quality control regulations.&#13;
4.4   Institute of Veterinary Research. The IVR established in 1928, is the only scientific research&#13;
center in veterinary field in Albania. The main tasks of the institute are: the control of epizootic&#13;
situation, the production of vaccines and other biological products, diagnosis of diseases and the&#13;
determination of the schemes of fitting the parasitic infections nationwide, and the control of livestock&#13;
food, the control of food stuff products and subproducts of animal origin produced within the country and&#13;
those of import-export. According to the 1995 Food Law the IVR is a National Center of Reference for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
the quality control of food with animal origin. According to this Law, the raw materials, fresh food,&#13;
products, subproducts and food residue with animal origin are exclusive control of the IVR.&#13;
4.5    Agriculturml and Food Design Institute. Prior to reorganization in 1992, the IPBU used to be&#13;
a part of the IKU. The IPBU has been given an independent status as a commercial organization to&#13;
render services to the private and public sector on payment basis. Thus, the IPBU supports its activities&#13;
by doing contracting job for the public and private sector organizations. For all practical purposes, it&#13;
now functions as a private professional organization with self-supporting mandate and no funding from&#13;
the MAF..  The institute has 35 well experienced staff and offers services in architecture, civil&#13;
construction, mechanical, electrical and sanitary engineering, food processing and economic studies. It&#13;
carries out feasibility studies, develops designs, supervises erection and construction work, including&#13;
commissioning of the plants. However, the institute lacks modern facilities and its staff need exposure&#13;
to modern technology. The GOA plans to privatize the IPBU to make it fully responsible for its services&#13;
and improve effectiveness.&#13;
4.6    Private Farmers Associations. The dissolution of the producer cooperative structures of the&#13;
former socialist Albania has generated a new class of largely subsistence farmers who form about 90&#13;
percent of the farming community and amongst whom there is still widespread resentment against&#13;
cooperatives. This community is characterized by its: adversity to risk and uncertainty; unwillingness&#13;
or inability to access credit at market rates; engagement in few market transactions; high priority on&#13;
investing in improved living standards and consumer durable; some access to remitted funds for&#13;
investment or to bolster the domestic budget; and, villages of often related people committed to working&#13;
within the extended family. So far about 100 private farmers associations (PFAs) embracing over 4,000&#13;
families have been formed and registered. These PFAs fall into three main categories:&#13;
*      Semi-subsistence joint household associations of about 15 families pooling land and&#13;
undertaking joint arable or mixed farming with a view to marketing surplus production;&#13;
-      Specialized joint household associations, also of around 15 families, undertaking a&#13;
specialized activity for which a large part of the output is sold, such as dairying or tractor&#13;
rental; and,&#13;
-      Commercial associations, small groups more closely resembling small private&#13;
partnerships, often of trained specialists who collaborate to purchase state agricultural&#13;
assets for production purposes and relying on employed labor and market sales.&#13;
4.7    The legal framework for the establishment of PFAs is only starting to emerge, although the basic&#13;
framework for private enterprise is now largely in place. Most existing associations are registered under&#13;
the Private Property Law and in some cases have their internal statutes registered under the Company&#13;
Law. Associations therefore under law, are more in the nature of limited liability companies than true&#13;
cooperatives, though their internal structure and organization may more closely follow cooperative&#13;
principals. Membership of these associations is often from the small commercial sector within the rural&#13;
population; frequently involves family related groups and/or families with contiguous land areas; and,&#13;
in the case of commercial associations, groups of former state-employed colleagues. Some associations&#13;
have been formed with the often unrealized expectation of receiving direct bilateral aid. Another quite&#13;
large collection of farmers' groups, having all female membership, has been formed under the USAID-&#13;
funded Land O'Lakes Dairy Improvement Program. While initially established for information extension&#13;
purposes, these groups of often enterprising and self-motivated women could form the basis of a network&#13;
of milk producers associations. Given small form holdings, it is essential that farmers organize&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
associations for the marketing of milk as well as supply of farm inputs. Later they could also get&#13;
associated with the marketing of other farm products. The proposed project would provide assistance for&#13;
the formation on a grass-roots voluntary basis (with no direction from government agencies) and in&#13;
improving the operations and management of such associations as well as in the formulation of a viable&#13;
strategy for the promotion of PFAs including enabling environment (e.g., legal fram2work, promotion,&#13;
training).&#13;
4.8    Albanian Dairy Association.  The ADA  was organized in 1994 and registered with the&#13;
International Dairy Federation. This volunteer committee is led by an 8 person executive committee with&#13;
representation from the MAF, IKU, University of Tirana and the private sector, half of the members&#13;
being from the private sector. The main objective of the ADA is to advise the MAF and government&#13;
agencies on matters relating to the dairy industry. The ADA is at its early stage of development and has&#13;
no resources at its disposal. If nurtured, it could evolve into an effective and credible body and make&#13;
a significant contribution to the development of the Albanian dairy industry. The ADA is represented&#13;
on the Project Coordination Committee established under the proposed project.&#13;
C.    Rural Financial Sector&#13;
4.9 Albania's Financial Sector. Commercial banking is a recent phenomenon in Albania. Only since&#13;
1991 do two-tier banks operate in separation from the Central Bank (Bank of Albania, BOA). The three&#13;
state-owned banks which emerged from the former centrally-planned economic regime still account for&#13;
more than 95%  of loans and deposits; only three foreign joint-venture banks have been set up since&#13;
1994'. New bank licensing regulations issued in June 1995 aim at facilitating the entry of further private&#13;
banks. BOA sets mandatory minimum interest rates on deposits while loan rates are largely market-set.&#13;
Since mid-1994, all lending rates are positive in real terms. Rather comprehensive banking regulation&#13;
is in place, but actual bank supervision and enforcement of regulations both require improvement.&#13;
Overall financial and banking sector development is supported under the IDA-financed Enterprise and&#13;
Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (EFSAC, FY94). See Annex 4.2 for a more comprehensive&#13;
background on the financial sector.&#13;
4.10   The state banks are characterized by serious deficiencies in management and staff skills, lack of&#13;
corporate governance by the Ministry of Finance, obsolete technical equipment and facilities, and&#13;
worsening financial condition.  Banks also suffer under inadequate tools to legally enforce loan&#13;
repayment, especially given a very weak judiciary system. Outside expertise from qualified, experienced&#13;
bankers is required to transform the state-owned banks into viable institutions. Given the lack of such&#13;
qualifications in Albania, the Government is considering bank privatization through involvement of&#13;
foreign banks. The weakness of the state-owned banks has led to a very active informal sector, providing&#13;
the bulk of financial services in rural areas. Additional rural credit is provided through the Village Credit&#13;
Funds system, set up under the IDA-funded Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project (FY93), followed by&#13;
the Rural Development Project (FY95). As of mid-1995, the 74 village-based credit committees have&#13;
approved a total of US$ 1.3 million in credit for some 3,400 small loans to village members, with a near&#13;
100% repayment record. It is foreseen that Village Credit Funds would eventually evolve into a&#13;
cooperative banking system.&#13;
1/     State-owned banks include: the National Commercial Bank (NCB), the Rural Commercial Bank (RCB), and the&#13;
Savings Bank (SB). Private banks, as of mid-1995, are: the Albanian-Italian Bank; the Arab Albanian Islamic Bank;&#13;
and the Dardania Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
4.11   Rural Commercial Bank (RCB). The RCB emerged as a new state-owned bank only in October&#13;
1993, after unrecoverable state enterprise debt by its predecessor institution had been covered by the&#13;
public budget. Under financing from the IDA-supported Agriculture Sector Adjustment Credit (ASAC,&#13;
FY93), a comprehensive program of institutional strengthening in key areas was initiated for the RCB,&#13;
and significant progress has been made in the accounting and credit areas since the fall of 1993 (see&#13;
Annex 4.2 for details). Nevertheless, serious management and corporate governance issues prevail,&#13;
preventing the bank from fully developing its capacity to serve its new private-sector clientele. RCB's&#13;
loan customers are some 12,000 private farmers, agro-processing enterprises, traders and related service&#13;
providers. Through its extensive network with 33 branches and 130 agencies, the bank reaches most of&#13;
rural Albania. With some US$40 million equivalent in outstanding loans, as of April 1995, it is the&#13;
largest provider of bank credit in the country; its deposit base equals US$56 million equivalent.&#13;
4.12   RCB's financial health is seriously endangered by its rising portfolio of non-performing loans.&#13;
Together with fixed assets and non-interest bearing claims on the public budget, non-performing loans&#13;
and accrued interest add up to about Lek 3 billion (US$33 million), or some 62% of adjusted total assets2.&#13;
Consequently, the bank faces a structural cash-flow gap which cannot be overcome without financial&#13;
restructuring. Loan collection performance of the bank has improved significantly since 1993, with&#13;
average collection rates on current loans rising from a mere 40% in 1993 to 65% in early 1995. Loan&#13;
collections vary strongly between branches, with levels of above 90% for the best 5 branches and 0%&#13;
collections for the worst 2 branches. In response, RCB has halted new lending in all but the best-&#13;
performing branches. A main reason for poor loan collections are some Lek 1.4 billion in truck and&#13;
tractor loans extended by the bank between mid-1993 and early 1994 which, based on political&#13;
motivations, were approved with a one-year maturity, causing the default of practically all borrowers.&#13;
RCB has embarked on a rescheduling initiative with longer loan maturities for about 70% of the affected&#13;
loans, with the difference going to legal enforcement of the collateral. After adjusting for loan loss risks&#13;
through additional provisions, above and beyond the legal requirements in Albania, the bank is technically&#13;
insolvent and requires financial restructuring and recapitalization. The Government is committed to issue&#13;
bonds for this purpose, preferably as part of a package to privatize the bank at the same time. A recent&#13;
privatization feasibility study indicated interest by a number of foreign banks to invest into the RCB. The&#13;
Government is moving aggressively to privatize the RCB with a majority foreign ownership and is in&#13;
contact with a number of potential buyers. If this were not to materialize, as an alternative, the RCB&#13;
could be downsized through closure of non-viable branches, and possibly merged with another bank. The&#13;
privatization of state banks including the RCB is being handled under EFSAC and ASAC projects.&#13;
4.13   Independent Lending Unit. Given RCB's limited initial institutional capacity, an Independent&#13;
Lending Unit (ILU) was established under ASAC for on-lending of IDA proceeds to final borrowers, with&#13;
MOF carrying the credit risk. Loan evaluation and approval for ASAC sub-loans are carried out by the&#13;
ILU, which is located at RCB's Tirana head office. It uses RCB's net work of branches and head office&#13;
infrastructure for the preparation of loan application documentation, disbursements and collections. The&#13;
ILU has prepared a Manual of Operations outlining detailed procedures for the appraisal and supervision&#13;
of ASAC sub-loans. The Manual also includes procedures for the review of the environmental impact&#13;
of sub-projects. The accounts of the ILU are kept completely separate from the RCB and there is no&#13;
commingling of funds. The ILU is chaired by the Head of the Credit Department of RCB and includes&#13;
a Foreign Credit Expert and Albanian RCB staff. Loan approvals under ASAC require the agreement&#13;
by the expatriate expert. Initially, the ILU proved to be slow in starting up its operations, not unusual&#13;
for a new outfit. The establishment of proper loan processing procedures took longer than initially&#13;
expected, and the training of both ILU staff and RCB credit officers in the branches required substantial&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
efforts. As a result, the generation and processing of applications for ASAC sub-loans remained behind&#13;
expectations until mid-1994, despite strong and rising credit demand by the new private frminog ser'r;r&#13;
and emerging agro-processing enterprises.&#13;
4.14   By the end of 1994, the performance of ILU had improved considerably, as a result of general&#13;
streamlining of procedures and accelerated training of staff. As of mid-1995, the ASAC-funded rural&#13;
credit line (US$5 million) has been fully committed, with US$3.5 million in sub-loans, or 70% of total&#13;
available funds, disbursed to the rural borrowers. The majority of sub-loans, which have an average size&#13;
of US$100,000, finance a variety of agro-processing investments, followed by investments in forestry and&#13;
wood processing, rural services, livestock, fisheries, and agricultural production. An additional pipeline&#13;
for sub-loans, representing a total lending volume of over US$5 million, has been generated by the ILU,&#13;
in expectation of the proposed Agro-Processing Development Project. Loan collection rates for the first&#13;
ASAC sub-loans coming due are substantially higher than for RCB's overall collections. An internal&#13;
credit audit on 21 sub-loans extended since mid-1994 reveals general on-time repayment of interest due&#13;
during the one-year grace period on ASAC investment loans. However, due to issues on two sub-loans&#13;
where project start-up was delayed, initial average weighted collection rates on ASAC sub-loans reach&#13;
87% as of end-August 1995. It is expected that collection rates on ASAC sub-loans will reach or exceed&#13;
90% by the fall of 1995.&#13;
4.15   Future of ILU Operations. Since its establishment in early 1994, the operations of the ILU in&#13;
effectively reaching rural borrowers and identifying viable sub-projects are judged to be working rather&#13;
well, especially when compared to other banking institutions and donor credit windows in the country.&#13;
The ILU has largely fulfilled its objective of becoming a vehicle for an efficient rural banking window&#13;
within RCB, and ILU's credit evaluation standards and operational procedures became the basis for&#13;
revising RCB's Credit Manual and the bank's overall credit management. If RCB was to be privatized&#13;
in the near future, the ILU could remain a part of the bank. Alternatively, if RCB was to be downsized&#13;
and possibly merged with another bank, the ILU with its loan portfolio could be transferred to this new&#13;
bank as well.&#13;
D.    Coordination with Donors&#13;
4.16   Several donors are supporting MAF's livestock and agro-business development efforts. The GTZ&#13;
is implementing a three year pilot project (DM 6 million) to set up a small dairy plant in Tirana including&#13;
organizing a pilot milk collection scheme around Tirana. This plant to be owned by the MAF would be&#13;
managed by the GTZ experts. The Dutch Government is providing assistance for the development of a&#13;
national cattle breeding strategy and the production of bulls for the Al service. The Dutch Governmnent&#13;
also has an assistance program in Fier District for a regional rural development project (including&#13;
extension, and assistance to an agricultural middle school). The Italian authorities are considering&#13;
assistance to the livestock production sector.  USAID  is supporting organizing village level&#13;
demonstrations for rural women to improve on-farm milk production. USAID is also supporting a limited&#13;
technical advisory services program (under its SARA Project) for certain types of agro-businesses. The&#13;
Minister, MAF has assured that the Director APD would carefully monitor these activities to ensure&#13;
consistency and avoid duplication.&#13;
E.    Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
4.17   The proposed project closely reflects the development priorities formulated in the Country&#13;
Assistance Strategy (CAS-Report No. P-6058-ALB), which was discussed by the Board on September&#13;
14, 1993. According to the CAS, support for the development of private agriculture, which is Albania's&#13;
most important sector, is an area of priority. The CAS called generally for flexible programs that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
promote "new entrepreneurship and private enterprise," and it specifically cited the collapse of agro-&#13;
processing enterprises and the weakness of new, emerging private activities. The project would promote&#13;
private entrepreneurship and would form part of IDA's overall development strategy for the agriculture&#13;
sector, which was jointly formulated in October 1992 by the Bank, the EU, and GOA. It would build&#13;
on the reforms undertaken by GOA in the agriculture sector. By addressing critical agro-products&#13;
marketing issues in rural areas, the project would make a contribution towards the development of the&#13;
rural economy. It would also complement other IDA projects in agriculture and the rural sector,&#13;
particularly the Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project and follow-up Rural Development Project, which&#13;
focus on improving rural incomes and farm production; the ASAC, which supports various policy and&#13;
institutional reforms in the agriculture sector, including the privatization of agro-industrial enterprises;&#13;
and the Irrigation Rehabilitation Project, which supports, inter alia, an increase in fodder production.&#13;
V. PROPOSED PROJECT&#13;
A.    Project Objectives&#13;
5.1    The main objective of the proposed project is to support the development of the agro-processing&#13;
sector in Albania and to help improve the conditions for financing its restructuring through the financial&#13;
sector in order to improve marketing of farm outputs (thereby improving rural incomes) and availability&#13;
of food products to urban population.&#13;
B.    Project Justification and Scope&#13;
5.2   In the agro-processing sector, the proposed project would support an integrated private sector&#13;
approach in which the entire marketing chain, i.e., collection, processing and distribution of the products&#13;
is tackled. Consistent with the strategy outlined in a joint World Bank and European Commission&#13;
document (and adopted by the Government), entitled, "An Agricultural Strategy for Albania", October&#13;
1992, the proposed approach would be to make maximum utilization of existing assets whenever&#13;
economically feasible, with appropriate investments in renovation of existing plants including some new&#13;
equipment (e.g., packing units), as well as establishment of small new processing plants in rural and&#13;
urban areas. A substantial amount of training and technical support would be provided to upgrade skills&#13;
and to improve management and business practices, as well as to strengthen local institutional capacity.&#13;
5.3   In the absence of project supported activities the marketing constraints in Albania would become&#13;
even more acute, preventing farm production increases resulting from improved irrigation and other&#13;
factors, and limiting the farm surplus made available for sale. There is already evidence of milk and&#13;
other farm products being wasted because of lack of marketing and processing facilities and the situation&#13;
is likely to get worse without the project. In the absence of improved marketing and processing facilities,&#13;
the farmers would be forced to limit their production to subsistence levels only thereby contributing to&#13;
continued shortages of milk and other processed products to the urban population. It is quite evident&#13;
from ongoing experience that the project is needed to "make things happen". Since the prices of&#13;
agriculture products in Albania are liberalized and interest rates are market determined there are no&#13;
prevailing distortions in the market which are likely to hamper project effectiveness.&#13;
5.4    Design Considerations. The project has been designed with the objective of putting a minimum&#13;
burden on the government budget and to sustain itself in the long run without continuing government&#13;
support. In arriving at the proposed project design several alternatives were considered. For the&#13;
Entrepreneurs Support activities use of existing MAF department, setting up a new government body or&#13;
a totally private foundation were evaluated with the involvement of relevant public and private officials.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
It was decided that establishment of a Technical Services Unit with foreign and local expertise with&#13;
minimum government involvement which would evolve into a totally private sector operation, would be&#13;
most appropriate option. Given the importance of the agro-processing sector in the Albanian economy,&#13;
the need for substantial assistance, lack of private sector alternatives, and low paying capacity of&#13;
emerging entrepreneurs, the initial public investment in technical assistance is well justified for a period&#13;
of 2-3 years. In the long run, such activity is expected to be taken over by the private sector. For the&#13;
line of credit, the Government had desired a targeted line reserved exclusively for the dairy sector.&#13;
However, due to its potential adverse distortionary impact on resource allocation, it was decided to open&#13;
the credit line to the entire agriculture sector. For the financing channel, as described earlier, there are&#13;
no well developed banking institutions in Albania and it would take several years before any well&#13;
functioning bank is expected to emerge. However, the pressing long-term resource needs of the&#13;
agriculture sector need to be met. Any delay (until the emergence of good banks) in making these&#13;
resources available would be very detrimental to the sector so important to the Albanian economy. To&#13;
achieve this purpose, several alternatives were considered. Establishment of a separate specialized&#13;
institution at this stage would not be cost effective and in the long run would be counter productive.&#13;
Continuing with the agency arrangements used successfully under the ASAC were also not considered&#13;
desirable as the GOA should not continue to carry the credit risk. Rather the RCB as a banking&#13;
institution should be fully responsible for lending at its own risk. It is also recognized that based on the&#13;
strict application of OD 8.30 criteria, the RCB would not to be eligible to borrow funds on its own due&#13;
to its weak financial condition. However, RCB's condition is expected to improve in the future, and with&#13;
IDA assistance the Government is aggressively pursuing a restructuring/privatization plan for the RCB.&#13;
Therefore, it is proposed to onlend funds through the RCB to service the agriculture sector with RCB&#13;
taking full risk.&#13;
C.    Project Description&#13;
5.5    The proposed project would have two main components: Entrepreneurs Support component and&#13;
Investment component. The technical assistance would be provided to agro-processing enterprises and&#13;
the credit line would be available to the agriculture sector.&#13;
5.6    Entrepreneurs Support Component (US$2.1 million). The project would provide assistance to&#13;
agro-processing enterprises while focussing its support on the dairy industry. The project would fully&#13;
utilize the technical skills available in Albania and would strengthen these with outside expertise in project&#13;
management, business management, marketing and financial management. The focus would be on&#13;
providing technical support to entrepreneurs, farmers and farmers associations. The project would&#13;
provide assistance to farmers in the organization of new PFA's, in improving their operations and&#13;
management, as well as to the MAF in the formulation of a strategy for the promotion of PFA's including&#13;
legal framework, policy environment, etc. The project would also support the limited strengthening of&#13;
local technical institutions -- Food Research Institute, Agriculture and Food Design Institute, and Albanian&#13;
Dairy Association -- engaged in the provision of services to agro-industry. For that purpose a Technical&#13;
Services Unit (TSU), with the support of a foreign firm with Albanian counterparts has been established&#13;
under the direct supervision of the APD (para 6.2). The TSU would provide assistance to individual&#13;
private agro-processing entrepreneurs, farmers and their associations in the preparation of investment&#13;
proposals, and provide subsequent downstream extension advice. It would also provide assistance to the&#13;
Food Research Institute, Institute of Veterinary Research, and selected District Quality Control&#13;
Laboratories involved in the implementation of 1995 food quality control legislation. The project would&#13;
also include technical assistance to the ILU(RCB) for the appraisal and supervision of sub-projects. The&#13;
project would provide funds for foreign and local experts, training, laboratory equipment and materials,&#13;
travel, transportation and equipment. Further details are given in Annex 5.1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
5.7   Investment Component (US$S5.0 miin). The project would provide funds for making long-term&#13;
loans (including incremental working capital), at market rates, to agricultural sector which would include&#13;
production, processing, marketing, distribution and service activities. The Ministry of Finance (MOF)&#13;
would onlend IDA funds, under a subsidiary loan agreement, to the RCB in US dollars (with MOF&#13;
carrying the cross-currency risk) with up to ten years maturity, at LIBOR plus C.5%. Repayment&#13;
schedule of funds by the RCB to the MOF would not be linked with sub-loan maturities; this would help&#13;
the RCB in improving its financial structure. The RCB would onlend (through the ILU) to private&#13;
agriculture enterprises, entrepreneurs, farmers and farmers associations taking full credit risk (under&#13;
ASAC, the credit and foreign exchange risks were taken by the MOF). The ILU would be responsible&#13;
for carrying out the appraisal and approval decisions, and would seek the advice of TSU on the technical&#13;
aspects of sub-projects. For high transaction cost sub-projects, the RCB would receive from the&#13;
Government, based on the agreed criteria, (sub-projects located in remote areas, sub-loans of up to&#13;
US$30,000 and sub-loans to PFAs), incentive bonus of 2% to help defray the higher transaction costs&#13;
associated with processing of such scattered projects which are difficult to evaluate and monitor since they&#13;
depend so much on both upstream and downstream linkages. In order to maintain continued high sub-&#13;
loan standards, the RCB would be permitted to commit funds in excess of US$2.5 million only after&#13;
showing evidence that it has maintained satisfactory collection rates (90%) on sub-loans made under the&#13;
ASAC as well as under the proposed project. The RCB/GOA would maintain onlending arrangements&#13;
satisfactory to IDA. The GOA would consult IDA before making any changes in the ownership structure&#13;
of the RCB and would prepare by December 31, 1996, and implement, a satisfactory financial&#13;
restructuring and privatization plan for the RCB, as agreed under EFSAC project. Signing of a&#13;
Subsidiary Loan Agreement between the RCB and MOF, under terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA,&#13;
would be a condition of Credit Effectiveness.&#13;
5.8    Terms of Sub-loans. The sub-loans to sub-borrowers would be offered both in foreign currency&#13;
and Leks, at market rates. The foreign exchange risk on Lek sub-loans would be borne by the RCB and&#13;
on foreign currency sub-loans by the sub-borrowers. The sub-loans would be made on general conditions&#13;
applicable to RCB's investment loans, with positive real interest rates as already tested successfully under&#13;
the ASAC. For foreign currency sub-loans, interest rates would be linked with LIBOR with an&#13;
appropriate spread. Maximum sub-loan size would be $250,000 with a maximum of $400,000 equivalent&#13;
to any single sub-borrower; in deserving cases, exceptions to this limit may be granted with IDA&#13;
approval. The sub-loans would be evaluated on the basis of the business merit of sub-projects supported&#13;
by a business plan; sub-project viability evaluation would also include consideration of the availability&#13;
of essential services to farmers (e.g., veterinary doctors and medicines, animal feeds, etc.). Further&#13;
evaluation criteria would be available collateral and environmental impact of sub-projects. Business plan&#13;
requirements for smaller sub-projects (e.g., sub-loans up to US$30,000, farmers) would be kept simple.&#13;
The free limit on sub-loans would be US$200,000 equivalent thereby any sub-loan of US$200,000 and&#13;
above would be subject to IDA's prior review. The maximum maturity of sub-loans would be seven&#13;
years including grace period of up to one year, and minimum maturity two years. To encourage long&#13;
term lending, at least 50% of the funds would be reserved for sub-loans of maturity of four years or&#13;
longer. Sub-borrowers would normally provide at least 20 percent of total sub-project costs. However,&#13;
to encourage entrepreneurial development, in exceptional cases (e.g., small entrepreneurs, plant workers,&#13;
PFAs), the sub-borrowers may receive sub-loans of up to 100 percent of the sub-project costs with IDA's&#13;
prior approval. Sub-borrowers would need to demonstrate their credit-worthiness based on their capacity&#13;
to repay sub-loans out of projected cash generation or equity increases. Enterprises must maintain a debt-&#13;
equity ratio of no more than 70:30 and a debt service coverage ratio of not less than 1.5:1. Eligible sub-&#13;
projects shall have a financial rate of return of at least 12 percent, in real terms. Sub-borrowers would&#13;
also be required by the ILU/RCB to adhere to basic environmental and procurement guidelines.&#13;

D.    Project Costs and Financing&#13;
5.9    Project Costs. Total project costs are estimated at US$7.1 million including $5.0 million for&#13;
Investment and US$2.1 million for Entrepreneurs Support components as shown in Table 5.1 below:&#13;

at the exchange rate prevailing in July 1995 (90 Leks/US$1). No physical or price contingencies have&#13;
been applied to credit component because they reflect programs without precise, predetermined unit costs.&#13;
Physical and price contingencies of 5 percent each have been applied to Entrepreneurs Support activities.&#13;
5.11   Financing Plan. The proposed IDA Credit would be US$6.0 million equivalent (SDR 4.1&#13;
million). The Netherlands Government is providing grant cofinancing of US$1.0 million for the&#13;
Entrepreneurs Support component. Effectiveness of the Netherlands Grant Agreement would be a&#13;
Condition of Effectiveness of the proposed IDA Credit. In view of Albania's budgetary constraints,&#13;
Government's contribution (US$0.1 million) would be limited to the provision of office space, cost of&#13;
administrative services, salaries of non incremental staff, and taxes and duties. TSU's Albanian staff&#13;
would be financed by the project as part of TSU foreign firm's contract.&#13;
E.    Environmental Aspects&#13;
5.12   The project in classified in category "B" in accordance with OD 4.01. Within the Ministry of&#13;
Health and Environmental Protection a working group was created in March 1992 -- the Committee of&#13;
Environmental Preservation and Protection. The Committee considers itself independent from the&#13;
Ministry of Health and Environment and has 13 employees in Tirana, and another 35 in the&#13;
regions/districts. With the assistance from the World Bank, an environmental assessment was carried out&#13;
and priorities areas for actions were identified. The study, Albania Environmental Strategy Study of June&#13;
1993, was used by the Ministry of Health and Environmental Protection in drafting the National&#13;
Environmental Action Plan. The action plan specifies the actions to be taken in the short term, medium&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
term and long term (3-5 years). The committee would propose a new legislation on the environmental&#13;
standards, which most likely would be ready at the end of 1996. It should follow up on the level of&#13;
pollution created by the agro-processing plants when they start to operate again. Under the proposed&#13;
project, the TSU's foreign firm would assist GOA in reviewing food plant effluent standards and in&#13;
developing an action program to ensure that relevant government agencies monitor compliance.&#13;
5.13   In the past, the agro-processing plants in Albania were polluting the environment for example&#13;
through smoke from coal fired boilers, product wastes and waste water. In dairy plants, whey from&#13;
cheese production was returned to the state farms for pig feeding. The environmental legislation, which&#13;
is still in force, is a temporary legislation and apparently based on standards from the Former Soviet&#13;
Union. The latest revision of the standards were made in 1973 and ratified in 1975. The agro-processing&#13;
plants have had none or very simple waste water treatment, most of the waste water has gone into the&#13;
sewerage of the different cities. However, the cities do not have any sewerage treatment plants which&#13;
works, and all waste water goes to the rivers un-treated. It would take several years until cities have got&#13;
a sewerage treatment system into place.&#13;
5.14   The rehabilitation of the agro-processing plants would continue to create a certain level of&#13;
pollution in the disposal of plant effluent to the ditches/rivers, since the plants (or cities) do not have at&#13;
present any waste water control. The dairy plant would mainly produce market milk and cheese, no milk&#13;
powder or condensed milk would be manufactured, since the quantities of milk are too small in order to&#13;
start up such a production. Some by-products like whey could be sold to farmers for pig breading. The&#13;
waste water coming from many agro-processing and dairy plants would most likely have a BOD content&#13;
of 250-350 mg per liter. In such cases, a simple aeration tank with proper design could reduce the BOD&#13;
content with some 30 to 50 percent, and the remaining waste water could be acceptable for discharge into&#13;
the sewerage system. Under ASAC project, the ILU has established procedures for the review of&#13;
environmental impact of sub-projects.  These procedures have been reviewed by the Regional&#13;
Environmental Division.  The ILU  would review  each sub-project for compliance with basic&#13;
environmental guidelines which are consistent with Albanian Environmental legislation and World Bank&#13;
Environmental guidelines.&#13;
F.    Impact on Women&#13;
5.15   The proposed project is expected to have a positive impact on the women. In Albania, women&#13;
take primary responsibility for the management of ruminant stock and, dependent on the scale of the&#13;
operation, frequently take charge of the production and marketing of dairy products. Where women are&#13;
involved in farm products especially fruits, vegetables and milk marketing, the task may involve a bus&#13;
trip to town and the commitment of up to a half day to sell small quantities of products. Income thus&#13;
derived is frequently retained by women for household expenses though any balance is likely to be&#13;
submitted to the male household head on a regular basis and expenditure accounted for. While, agro-&#13;
products production, processing and marketing may afford women some control over the household&#13;
budget, it is a time consuming addition to the already onerous life of the female smallholder farmer.&#13;
Improved access to markets for agro-products should give relief to women in perhaps the most time&#13;
consuming tasks of one of the major activities at the farm, while at the same time providing regular&#13;
household income. The stimulation of private farmers associations would provide improved access to&#13;
input supplies and technical information with consequent impact on farm productivity and household&#13;
income. Credit for which women would be eligible, could permit access to more animals or investment&#13;
in small-scale processing, capturing traditional skills frequently held by women to add value to farm&#13;
products.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
G.    Impact on Poverty&#13;
5.16   A typical Albanian farm today generates livestock surplus for sale while fruits and vegetables are&#13;
also picking up. Milk production alone generates about 20 percent of the value of agricultural GDP,&#13;
while associated ruminant meat production accounts for a further 8-12 per cent making ruminant&#13;
production the single most important activity in the rural sector and frequently the primary source of cash&#13;
income for the farm family. With an estimated over 60 percent of surplus milk, and other farm products&#13;
now unable to find a market, the revitalization of the agro-processing industry could have a significant&#13;
impact on smallholder farm family income. In monetary terms, a 10 percent increase in marketed milk&#13;
from the statistically average farm of 1.66 ha carrying 0.77 cows and producing 1,250 liters of milk&#13;
would raise family cash income by 2,250 Lek, an amount equivalent to a months wage as an agricultural&#13;
laborer. As farmer confidence in the economic recovery improves and the farm family self-sufficiency&#13;
mentality declines it is likely that a further 10 to 15 percent of production could be made available to the&#13;
market. Access to a reliable market outlet would ensure a regular cash income from dairy and other farm&#13;
products sales, a factor that frequently leads to higher and more timely investment in other agricultural&#13;
production activities, and is likely to stimulate increased investment in farm production, with most of such&#13;
incremental product marketed. Although the project components do not contain specific mechanisms for&#13;
targeting the least well off, it is expected, given the nature of the project and its components that the&#13;
population of project beneficiaries would have a larger proportion of poor people than the population as&#13;
a whole. In Albania, farmers are generally poor with very small farms and only I to 3 animals. The&#13;
project is expected to benefit them most although indirectly through improved marketability of farm&#13;
products.  Therefore, the project would be rated as "Poverty Category:  Program  for Targeted&#13;
Interventions" in accordance with the provisions of OD 4.15.&#13;
H.    Project Benefits and Risks&#13;
5.17   The project would contribute several benefits to the Albanian economy. It would promote&#13;
restructuring of the agro-processing sector. As stated above, it is expected to help improve rural incomes&#13;
by putting in place a market access to farmers to sell their surplus farm products such as fruits,&#13;
vegetables, meat and milk thereby reducing their wastage and generating regular cash. Milk provides&#13;
a daily cash flow throughout the year without excessive borrowing and as such empowers women. It&#13;
tempers some of the seasonality in cash availability in rural areas which could lead to poverty reduction&#13;
as well as an overall better diet in rural and urban areas. Access to markets would also result in&#13;
improved farm production. The urban consumer would receive supply of quality processed food&#13;
products. It would make strides in institution-building improving private entrepreneurship and human&#13;
capital through training, technical education and advice. Organization of PFAs would have several&#13;
indirect benefits, e.g., system to supply farm inputs, better product handling techniques, pooling of&#13;
supplies for better markets. Improvements in the quality control system would also have a positive&#13;
impact on food production and nutritional intake. Application of project evaluation techniques including&#13;
financial rate of return would ensure that only commercially viable investments are supported; all sub-&#13;
projects would have at least 12% rate of return in real terms. Given liberalized prices of most agro-&#13;
products, open international trade with low tariffs, and market based foreign exchange rates, the border&#13;
prices are reflected in prevailing domestic prices in Albania. Thus the economic returns on the&#13;
investments to be financed are expected to be either equal to or higher than their financial returns.&#13;
5.18   The project would carry significant risks. Given limited institutional capacity, the implementation&#13;
may be slow; this risk would be mitigated by the establishment of TSU by engaging an experienced&#13;
foreign firm. Privatization of agro-processing plants may not succeed as fast as needed; this risk is being&#13;
addressed under the ASAC with appropriate policy conditional ities; and the Government is taking serious&#13;
steps to privatize agro-industrial enterprises. The private entrepreneurs may be reluctant to borrow loans&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
at market rates; discussions with private and public sector have revealed strong interest in loans and the&#13;
ILU has a pipeline of good private sector investments. Another major risk would be institutional and&#13;
financial capacity of the RCB to be able to service loans and monitor their performance; this risk is being&#13;
addressed under ASAC and EFSAC projects with appropriate institutional development program and&#13;
conditionalities. The RCB's condition is expected to improve in the future. The Government is&#13;
committed to restructure/privatize the RCB with majority foreign ownership. It is aggressively pursing&#13;
this option with potential foreign buyers. The ILU would approve and supervise sub-loans and will have&#13;
foreign expertise available under the project. While the risks are significant, project design includes&#13;
specific steps to manage them. In addition, in view of these risks the approach would be to keep&#13;
flexibility in project design and to enable necessary adjustments during project implementation.&#13;
VI. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.    Project Organization and Management&#13;
6.1    The MAF would take overall management for the proposed project with Director of the APD&#13;
responsible for project execution related to the Entrepreneurs Support component and the RCB taking&#13;
responsibility for the Investment component. The Director of the APD would be advised by the Project&#13;
Coordination Committee (PCC) established by the MAF in July 1993 with the primary objective of&#13;
involving private sector in the formulation and implementation of the proposed project as well as in the&#13;
planning of a long term strategy for the development of the dairy industry. This Committee, chaired by&#13;
the MAF Vice Minister, includes Director of the APD as its Secretary, Director (Agriculture and Animal&#13;
Production, MAF), representatives from the IKU, RCB, ADA, PFAs and other private entrepreneurs.&#13;
To avoid duplication, the PCC would have a good working relationship with ADA, and IKU as these are&#13;
represented on the PCC. The Project Implementation Plan has been agreed with the Government at&#13;
negotiations (Annex 6.1).&#13;
6.2    Technical Services Unit. Project implementation and day-to-day activities of the project would&#13;
be carried out through a Technical Services Unit (Annex 5.11. Agreement has been reached with the&#13;
APD that the TSU would have independence in implementing its agreed work program. The TSU would&#13;
consist of a foreign firm experienced in dairy processing (including milk collection, organization of PFAs,&#13;
processinig, quality conr:rol, marketing and project management). The firm would provide quality experts-&#13;
- one long term consultant for 2 years, as well as short term consultants (20 person months) for&#13;
specialized needs who would visit Albania when required to provide assistance in areas with skills gap.&#13;
The firm would also be responsible for all project related training. Within two months of its joining the&#13;
firm would recruit of 4-6 qualified Albanian professional counterparts from the private sector or an&#13;
Albanian institution under terms satisfactory to IDA. These counterparts would be trained in all aspects&#13;
of TSU's activities and towards the end of the project would take over project management from the&#13;
foreign firm. A majority of TSU's Albanian staff would be from the private sector. In addition to the&#13;
foreign firm, some short term experts (foreign and local) would be employed as needed to support TSU&#13;
and the ILU. The TSU would charge fee for its services from the second year of its operation.&#13;
6.3   It is expected that at the end of this project, the TSU would convert itself into a private consulting&#13;
firm or be wound up. The preference would be that the TSU become a private body supported by the&#13;
industry with no continuing fiscal burden on the Government. Procurement for the foreign firm and&#13;
acquisition of vehicles and office equipment is being undertaken under the PPF Advance. In addition,&#13;
some training and study tour activities would also be carried out under the PPF in order to do advance&#13;
work for the preparation of bankable investment projects. The TSU and APD, under terms and&#13;
conditions satisfactory to IDA, would be maintained during project implementation.&#13;

6.4     Procurement Arrangements.   Major project elements, their estimated  costs and proposed&#13;
procurement methods are given in Table 6.1. All procurement financed with IDA Credit would be&#13;
carried out according to Bank Guidelines, "Procurement Under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits&#13;
(Procurement Guidelines)", dated January 1995. After project approval, a project launch workshop&#13;
would be organized in Tirana in February 1996.&#13;
6.5      Country Procurement Procedures.  A  Country Procurement Strategy Paper (CPSP) has been&#13;
prepared for Albania. The country procurement assessment for Albania is scheduled for February 1996.&#13;
According to the CPSP, the provisions of the Procurement Decree currently in force in Albania are not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
acceptable for use under IDA-financed projects. The Procurement Plan (Annex 6.2) identifies all major&#13;
contract packages, their estimated values, methods and dates of key-procurement targets.&#13;
6.6    Procurement Implementation Agency.  Procurement related to the Entrepreneurs Support&#13;
component would be the responsibility of the MAF's Project Management Unit established under the&#13;
IDA-financed Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (PMU-IRP). This Unit has already gained considerable&#13;
experience in project management and procurement and is properly equipped and staffed. Procurement&#13;
under the Investment component would be undertaken by the sub-borrowers under the supervision of the&#13;
ILU. The ILU has gained considerable experience in this area under the IDA-financed ASAC. Standard&#13;
IDA bidding documents would be used for all procurement which follow International Competitive&#13;
Bidding (ICB) procedures.&#13;
6.7    Methods of Procurement. (i) Investment Component. Under this component purchase of civil&#13;
works, equipment, materials/supplies, services, etc. would be financed by the sub-loans. The procurement&#13;
of goods would be undertaken by the sub-borrowers (receiving sub-loans from the RCB) through the&#13;
established commercial practices in Albania involving obtaining of multiple quotations from different&#13;
suppliers/countries, and which are acceptable to IDA in terms of IDA's basic principles of procurement.&#13;
All contracts of US$250,000 and above would be procured following ICB procedures. Procurement of&#13;
consultancy services would follow the World Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. Procurement&#13;
of consultancy contracts of up to US$50, 000 would be carried out under the supervision of the RCB.&#13;
6.8   (ii) Entrepreneurs Support Component.  The total amount of funds allocated to the&#13;
Entrepreneurs Support component is US$2.0 million (including US$1.0 million cofinancing from the&#13;
Netherlands Government for which IDA procurement guidelines will be followed) to finance foreign and&#13;
local experts, laboratory, transport and office equipment/materials, and travel, training and study tours&#13;
(see para 5.6). National Shopping- Goods estimated to cost under US$50,000 per contract (aggregate&#13;
US$170,000) will be procured under National Shopping (NS) procedures based on comparison of price&#13;
quotations obtained from at least three local suppliers. Given the presence of a number of foreign&#13;
suppliers with offices in the country, there is sufficient competition within the country for the goods to&#13;
be procured. International Shopping- Goods estimated to cost over US$50,000 per contract but under&#13;
US$250,000 per contract (aggregate US$780,000) will be procured through International Shopping (IS)&#13;
based on comparison of price quotations obtained from at least three eligible suppliers from two different&#13;
countries. ICB-- all contracts of US$250,000 and above would be procured following ICB procedures.&#13;
6.9    Consultant Services. Procurement of consultant services would follow the Guidelines for Use&#13;
of Consultants by Borrowers and by the World bank as Executing Agency (Guidelines for the use of&#13;
Consultants), dated August 1981. Bank's Standard "Form of Contract, Consultant's Services" will be&#13;
used for all major consultant services contracts. Some 4-6 consultant services contracts in the range of&#13;
US$10,000 and US$600,000 are expected under the project for the TSU and ILU, as per details given&#13;
in Annex 6.2.&#13;
6.10  IDA's Prior Review. Procurement documentation for all International Shopping contracts for&#13;
goods will be subject to IDA's prior review. In addition, first two National Shopping contracts will be&#13;
subject to IDA's prior review. Consultant contracts estimated to cost US$50,000 and more will be&#13;
subject to IDA's prior review In this respect prior IDA approval of budgets, short lists, selection&#13;
procedures, letters of invitation, evaluation reports and contracts will be required.  Prior IDA review&#13;
will also apply to the terms of reference of all consultant contracts, to the employment of individuals, to&#13;
single source selection of firms, to assignments of a critical nature as reasonably determined by IDA and&#13;
to amendments of contracts raising the contract value above US$50,000. Other procurement such as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
external/internal training and study tours will be carried out with IDA's advance approval. Procurement&#13;
activities not requiring IDA's prior review would be monitored by IDA supervision missions during their&#13;
visits.&#13;
C.    Disbursements&#13;
6.11   The proposed IDA Credit is expected to be disbursed over a period of three years. The closing&#13;
date would be June 30, 1999 or before depending on the rate of disbursements (Annex 6.3).&#13;
Disbursements for the Entrepreneurs Support component would be handled by the PMU-IRP and for the&#13;
Investment component by the ILU(RCB). Disbursements for consultants and goods contracts for less than&#13;
US$50,000 equivalent and sub-loans contracts for less than US$200,000 equivalent will be based on the&#13;
Statement of Expenditures (SOEs). The required documents would be retained by the PMU-IRP and the&#13;
ILU, respectively for at least one year after receipt by IDA of the audit report for the year in which the&#13;
last disbursement was made. This documentation would be made available for review by the auditors and&#13;
visiting IDA staff upon request. The project would finance the following expenditures as given in Table&#13;
6.2 below:&#13;
Table 6.2 Summary of Expenditures to be Financed&#13;
Categories                     Amount (US$ mil)s) Percentage of Expenditures&#13;
1. Sub-loans by the RCB to               5.00         100%&#13;
sub-borrowers&#13;
2. Vehicles, equipment and                0.15        100% of foreign expenditures; 100% of local&#13;
laboratory materials                             expenditures (ex-factory cost); 85% for&#13;
other items procured locally&#13;
3. Technical assistance, study tours     0.10         100%&#13;

4. Refund of PPF Advance                 0.60         --&#13;
5. Unallocated                           0.15         --&#13;
a)     Excludes US$1.0 million Netherlands Cofuiancing to be disbursed through IDA.&#13;
6.12 Special Account. To facilitate timely project implementation the GOA would establish, maintain&#13;
and operate under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA, a Special Account in US dollars in the Bank&#13;
of Albania. During the early stage of the project, the initial allocation of the Special Account would be&#13;
limited to US$0.4 million. However, when the aggregate disbursements under the Credit have reached&#13;
the level of the SDR 1.0 million, the initial allocation may be increased up to the authorized allocation&#13;
of US$0.8 million by submitting the relevant Application for Withdrawal. Replenishment applications&#13;
should be submitted at least every three months, and must include reconciled bank statements as well as&#13;
other appropriate supporting documents. At negotiations, these authorized allocations have been finalized&#13;
with the Government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
D.    Supervision, Monitoring, and Reporting&#13;
6.13   Supervision. Given its nature and limited Albanian capacity, the project would require close&#13;
follow up and supervision from IDA. Regular supervision missions would be undertaken including field&#13;
visits and reviews of sub-projects financed under the credit component managed by the RCB. After&#13;
project approval project launch workshop would be organized in Tirana in February 1996. During the&#13;
first year three supervision missions (18-20 staff weeks) are planned. During the second (15 staffweeks)&#13;
and third year (12 staff weeks) 2-3 missions are expected each year. The missions would be staffed with&#13;
IDA staff and consultants with expertise in agro-processing, quality control and institution building. At&#13;
negotiations agreements have been reached that both APD (TSU) and RCB (ILU) would submit to IDA&#13;
quarterly progress reports on project implementation including procurement, the status of each activity&#13;
or component and number of loans issued or pending and amount of investments. Both APD (TSU) and&#13;
ILU would also be responsible for preparing annual work plans and budgets establishing targets as&#13;
envisaged in an implementation program to be prepared by both institutions before project effectiveness.&#13;
The APD (TSU) would also prepare a comprehensive progress report and recommendations which would&#13;
form the basis of the mid-term review. A final report would be prepared by both agencies (ADP and&#13;
RCB) at project completion.&#13;
6.14   Monitoing. Performance indicators would be monitored by the TSU and the ILU (Annex 6.4).&#13;
In order to ensure continued strong ownership with the Government, Project Performance Indicators were&#13;
finalized and agreed during negotiations. A Mid-Term Review would be conducted, by July 31, 1997,&#13;
which at that time would take stock of the project implementation including the review of the status of&#13;
the TSU with a view to look at the need to establish a permanent apex institutional mechanism (e.g.,&#13;
Private Dairy Development Foundation) to further promote dairy development in Albania in the long-&#13;
term, i.e., beyond the project period. This review would also include evaluation of the terms of the&#13;
investment credit including onlending arrangements. Prior to the Mid-Term Review, the MAF would&#13;
present, by June 30, 1997, a mid-term progress report on the project, and a development strategy for the&#13;
promotion of PFAs.&#13;
6.15   Accounts and Audits. Separate project accounts would be maintained by the two agencies as&#13;
follows: (i) by the ILU for each of the accounts using IDA Credit funds channeled to sub-borrowers;&#13;
(ii) by the PMU-IRP for costs incurred under the Entrepreneurs Support component, including, training,&#13;
tours, vehicles, equipment, etc. Assurance have been obtained at negotiations that the above accounts&#13;
would be maintained in accordance with sound and generally accepted accounting principles and practices&#13;
acceptable to IDA. The responsibility for auditing MAF's accounts, as in the case of all Government&#13;
entities, rests with the Auditor General. The accounts of other institutions involved in the project are&#13;
audited by independent auditing firms. All project accounts including RCB's all accounts would be&#13;
audited, based on international standards, by independent auditors acceptable to IDA and that the auditor's&#13;
opinion and long form report satisfactory to IDA on audits would be provided to IDA no later than six&#13;
months after the close of each fiscal year.&#13;
VII. AGREEMENTS REACHED AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
7.1    The following agreements have been reached during negotiations:&#13;
(a)    The ILU (RCB) would appraise, approve and supervise sub-loans with RCB taking full&#13;

these project accounts and RCB's accounts would be audited annually by independent&#13;
auditors satisfactory to IDA and audit reports provided to IDA annually (para 6.15).&#13;
7.2   The Conditions of Credit Effectiveness would be: (i) signing of a satisfactory Subsidiary Loan&#13;
Agreement between the MOF and the RCB (para 5.7); and (ii) effectiveness of the Netherlands&#13;
Grant Agreement (para 5.11).&#13;
7.3    Recommendation. With the above assurances, agreements and conditions, the proposed project&#13;
would be suitable for an IDA Credit of SDR 4.1 million (US$6.0 million equivalent) to the&#13;
Government of Albania under standard IDA terms with 40 year maturity.&#13;

Rural Commercial Bank&#13;
1. The Financial Sector in Albania&#13;
A. Institutional Setting&#13;
1.  Lack of Banking Skills. Since the democratic revolution in 1991, the supply of financial services&#13;
by the formal banking sector is constrained by a general inability of banks to respond to a growing credit&#13;
demand by the new private sector.  Bankers under the centrally-planned economy were mere&#13;
bookkeepers, transferring budget funds to state enterprises. There were no hard budget constraints and&#13;
therefore no need to assess borrowers' creditworthiness and ability to repay a loan. Banks now face the&#13;
need for radical change as they convert themselves into independent decision-makers involved in all&#13;
aspects of financial intermediation. Staff training and outside technical assistance for state-owned banks,&#13;
as well as the establishment of new private banks with strong foreign partners, are both required in order&#13;
to close the gap between the previous centrally-controlled banking system and a system of efficient&#13;
financial intermediation in a free-enterprise regime.&#13;
2.  Creation of State Banks. The emergence of commercial banking institutions, as separate legal&#13;
entities with a customer base and staff separate from the Central Bank, is a very recent phenomenon in&#13;
Albania. Based on Law No. 7491 of April 29, 1991 on the "Main Constitutional Provisions", the State&#13;
Bank of Albania (later transformed into the Bank of Albania (BOA), the Central Bank) was sub-divided&#13;
into four banks: the National Bank, the Albanian Commercial Bank, the Savings Bank (SB), and the Bank&#13;
for Agriculture and Development (BAD). Each of these banks were created through individual laws.&#13;
In January of 1993, the National Bank and the Albanian Commercial Bank were merged into the National&#13;
Commercial Bank (NCB). Under the IDA-supported Agriculture Sector Adjustment Credit (ASAC,&#13;
FY93), BAD was split into the Rural Commercial Bank (RCB) and the BAD in Liquidation, as of&#13;
October 1, 1993. RCB received the mandate to complete the liquidation of the BAD. The Ministry of&#13;
Finance (MOF) owns the capital and exercises management control over all state-owned commercial&#13;
banks. See Table I for an overview of the Albanian banking sector.&#13;
3.  Private Banks. Since 1993, a number of small private banks have been created in the form of joint-&#13;
ventures with foreign partners, including the Albanian-Italian Bank, the Arab Albanian Islamic Bank&#13;
(AAIB), and the Dardania Bank (DB). These banks are slowly building up their capacities to mobilize&#13;
household deposits and to lend to few selected credit customers, but as yet they play no major role&#13;
providing investment finance for agricultural and other rural activities. New bank licensing regulations&#13;
were issued in June 1995 to facilitate the entry of further new private banks, and some 20 applications&#13;
have been received since then by BOA. An initiative by the German KfW aims at creating a lending&#13;
institution for small- and medium-scale enterprises by end-1995. The new Albanian-American Enterprise&#13;
Fund is also expected to start lending activities for small and medium sized businesses, as well as equity&#13;
participation and possibly guarantee operations, by early 1996. Overall financial and banking sector&#13;
development, including specific regulatory measures in the banking sector, are supported under the Bank-&#13;
financed Enterprise and Financial Sector Adjustment Credit (EFSAC, FY94).&#13;

B. Regulatory Framework for Banks&#13;
4.      Legal Status of Banks. The "Law for the Banking System of Albania' (Law No. 7560 of April&#13;
28, 1992) sets out a two-tier banking system, with the Bank of Albania being assigned the role of the&#13;
Central Bank which is supervising banks at the second level. The law specifies, inter alia, bank licensing,&#13;
bank administration and ownership, operational requirements for banks (including reference to prudential&#13;
banking regulations), and auditing and reporting requirements.  With exception of the BAD  in&#13;
Liquidation, all state banks (RCB, NCB, and SB) and new private banks operate under the provisions of&#13;
the Banking Law.&#13;
5.      Interest Rates. Minimum interest rates for deposit operations, as well as non-enforced minimum&#13;
guideline lending rates are set by BOA, as shown in Table 2. In practice, most bank loans are still&#13;
extended at the guideline lending rates since risk-based pricing of loans is not yet applied widely. In&#13;
comparison with annual inflation, since 1994, lending rates are positive in real terms. As of July 1995,&#13;
BOA mandatory minimum deposit rates have been lowered further to reflect reduced inflationary&#13;
expectations for 1995.&#13;

6.      Banking Regulation. Based on the provisions of the April 1992 Banking Law, BOA has issued&#13;
all key elements of banking regulation. These include loan concentration limits, capital adequacy&#13;
requirements, as well as asset risk classification and loan loss provisioning standards in line with the Basle&#13;
Accord. However, given the very low observed loan collection rates in the country (about 50% on&#13;
average as of end-1994) BOA's loan loss provisioning requirements are clearly inadequate to generate&#13;
sufficient reserves against loan portfolio risks. In particular, BOA regulations do now allow banks to&#13;
make general loss provisions against non-overdue loans. BOA also sets bank-specific, quarterly ceilings&#13;
on new lending by the banks. The banking supervision department within BOA, established in August&#13;
1992, has made considerable progress in off-site supervision. Nevertheless, actual enforcement of&#13;
regulations and issuance of penalties to banks for non-compliance remain unsatisfactory.&#13;
7.      Bank Privatization. BOA and MOF are considering to draft specific legislation regarding the&#13;
privatization of the three State-owned banks.   Privatization  alternatives would  include: voucher&#13;
privatization through the Mass Privatization Program; privatization through partial liquidation; sale to&#13;
strategic investors within the country or abroad; or an international tender. Involvement of foreign banks&#13;
in the privatization process would be most desirable for RCB and NCB, such as to ensure experienced&#13;
bank management and strong corporate guidance, while domestic private ownership may be more&#13;
adequate for SB, given its strategic importance as the location for most individual domestic savings.&#13;
C. Rural Financial Services&#13;
8.      Credit Demand. Following the rapid dissolution of ex-cooperatives and the distribution of state&#13;
farm land, demand for agricultural credit by the new private farming sector continues to be strong and&#13;
rising. Individual farmers require access to credit in order to purchase farm inputs and mechanization&#13;
equipment. With rising demand for inputs and equipment by the farm sector, agricultural support&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

services such as traders and transport enterprises seek financial resources to be able to respond to these&#13;
new business opportunities. There is also quickly increasing loan demand by the new private agro-&#13;
industrial sector. As of mid-1995, the ASAC-funded rural credit line (US$5 million equivalent) through&#13;
RCB, administered by the Independent Lending Unit (ILU) within RCB, has been filly committed, with&#13;
US$3.48 million equivalent in sub-loans, or 70% of total available funds, disbursed to the borrowers (see&#13;
Table 3). The majority of sub-loans, which have an average size of US$100,000, finance a variety of&#13;
agro-processing investments in rural areas3. More than 80% of the approved aggregate sub-loan volume&#13;
is for rural investments in agriculture, fisheries, agro-processing and forestry. An additional pipeline for&#13;
sub-loans, representing a total lending volume of US$ 5 million equivalent, has been generated by the&#13;
ILU, in expectation of the proposed Agro-processing Development Project.&#13;

9.      Informal Credit. The bulk of financial services in both rural and urban areas continues to be&#13;
provided by the active informal financial sector. Traders, farmers and small entrepreneurs receive credit&#13;
from relatives, neighbors, and friends. There is also an increasingly well organized group of non-licensed&#13;
financial intermediaries collecting excess liquidity from individuals and lending for short-term credits.&#13;
Over the past 2 years, effective interest rates on these informal sector loans have come down from above&#13;
400 percent p.a. during mid-1993 to about 60 percent p.a. as of mid-1995. It is likely that informal&#13;
financial intermediation will continue to play an important role in the near future until the formal banking&#13;
sector would have increased the efficiency of its operations and be able to provide services to most rural&#13;
areas of the country.&#13;
10.    Rural Banking. Due to its substantial network of rural agencies, RCB remains the predominant&#13;
bank to provide financial services in rural areas, complemented by SB regarding acceptance of household&#13;
deposits. In three regions of the country, there is no other bank than RCB. RCB fulfills important&#13;
functions as the cash window for various Government services and agencies. RCB's clientele increasingly&#13;
31      The 24 agro-processing projects approved by the ILU include: flour production (7), breweries (6), pasta and bmad&#13;
production (3), milk processing (2), meat processing (2), soft drink production (2), coffee production (1), and fruit&#13;
processing (1).&#13;

comprises medium- and large scale enterprises in various sectors of the rural economy, including agro-&#13;
processing enterprises, trade, transport services, large farms and farmer associations, and other non-&#13;
agricultural sectors.&#13;
11.   International Donors. An important share of agricultural credit has been and will continue to be&#13;
made available by international donors. In addition to the IDA-funded ASAC credit line through RCB,&#13;
funds for agricultural lending have been made available under the Revolving Credit Account (RCA, some&#13;
ECU 2 million) of the EU-PHARE program, set up within RCB. An additional EU-funded credit line&#13;
for small- and medium scale enterprises, open to the agro-processing sector, through RCB (about US$2&#13;
million equivalent) is expected to be operational by end-1995. German-based Deutsche Ausgleichsbank&#13;
has started a credit program (DM 10 million) and a guarantee fund (DM 1.5 million) for rural borrowers&#13;
through RCB during 1995. Other credit programs potentially open to agricultural and rural investors&#13;
include the EU-PHARE/SME Foundation, a proposed EIB-funded credit line, a new KfW-backed credit&#13;
line (about DM 8 million equivalent), and the proposed Albanian-American Enterprise Fund (total initial&#13;
capital of US$30 million).&#13;
12.    Village Credit Funds. A further source of rural credit in Albania is the Village Credit Fund&#13;
system set up under the IDA-financed Rural Poverty Alleviation Pilot Project (FY93). As of end-June&#13;
1995, a total of 74 village-based credit committees have been established, performing decentralized loan&#13;
evaluations, making decisions on credit allocation and loan conditions, and supervising repayments. A&#13;
total of US$ 1.3 million has been on-lent for 3,417 loans, averaging US$375 per loan, with a 100 percent&#13;
repayment record in all but one village where credit activities have ceased. Up to an additional US$5&#13;
million is planned for on-lending under the Rural Development Project (FY95) which became effective&#13;
in May 1995. And under an IFAD-financed Northeastern Districts Rural Development Project, which&#13;
started up in early 1995, about US$ 4 million is available to extend the village credit fund system to four&#13;
northeastern districts. Village Credit Funds are able to grant small loans of up to US$1,000 equivalent&#13;
to farmers and other rural entrepreneurs which would be largely unattractive customers for commercially&#13;
operating banks. During the next three years, savings will be gradually introduced into the system, and&#13;
the framework for a sustainable cooperative banking institution will be developed.&#13;
1I. Rural Commercial Bank&#13;
A. Emergence of RCB in 1993&#13;
13.   RCB as a New Financial Institution. RCB emerged as a new bank only in October of 1993, after&#13;
BAD's unrecoverable loans to state enterprises and related liabilities had been isolated such as to create&#13;
a bank serving the needs of private agriculture and the rural sector on commercial banking principles.&#13;
A comprehensive program of institutional strengthening in key areas has been initiated upon creation of&#13;
the bank, and significant progress has been made in the accounting and credit areas since the fall of 1993.&#13;
Nevertheless, serious management and corporate governance issues prevail, as described further below,&#13;
preventing the bank from fully developing its capacity to serve its new private-sector clientele.&#13;
14.    Unrecoverable BAD Loans. The former BAD was the main source of credit to state enterprises&#13;
in the agricultural sector. Since practically all state farms and former agricultural cooperatives have been&#13;
dissolved since the 1991 democratic revolution, BAD had, therefore, lost its main clientele and debtors.&#13;
Within the policy framework under ASAC, Government decided to liquidate BAD and to create the new&#13;
RCB as a viable commercial bank as of October 1, 1993. Liquidation of BAD involved the write-off of:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.2                                         - 44 -&#13;
Page 6 of 14&#13;
(i) unrecoverable loans to state enterprises as of June 30, 1992, equal to Lek 2.85 billion. In accordance&#13;
with Decision No. 1033, dated April 8, 1993, of the Council of Ministers, Government decided to relieve&#13;
BAD from these bad debts; (ii) unrecoverable loans to state farms made by BAD since July 1, 1992, net&#13;
of collections. The principle amount is equal to about Lek 0.5 billion. Revenues from the sale of state&#13;
farm assets by the Ministry of Agriculture and Food were expected to cover these outstanding debts.&#13;
However, as of mid-1995, no principal repayments nor accrued interest payments had been made by the&#13;
State; (iii) outstanding housing loans of Lek 117 million, made by BAD, which Government decided to&#13;
repay on behalf of borrowers through proceeds from privatizing state-owned apartments and real estate.&#13;
On the liabilities side, as of October 1, 1993, the BAD in Liquidation inherited Lek 315 million in state&#13;
enterprise deposits, and Lek 2.98 billion in loans from NCB which had passed on funds from the Central&#13;
Bank to BAD for the purpose of lending to state enterprises in the agriculture sector.&#13;
15.   RCB License and Charter. RCB has received a license from BOA on September 23, 1993. The&#13;
license requires RCB to continue to collect outstanding BAD loans and to complete the liquidation of&#13;
BAD. RCB's license also sets out a minimum capital requirement for RCB of Lek 800 million, to be&#13;
reached by end-1996. RCB's Charter defines the bank's mission as a commercial bank operating on&#13;
sound banking principles, serving the needs of private sector customers in agriculture and in other rural&#13;
activities. Upon creation of RCB, Government recognized that the financial safety and soundness of the&#13;
new bank hinges upon the bank's autonomy in day-to-day decisions; therefore, the new Charter explicitly&#13;
sets out that if Government wishes the bank to extend credit to borrowers the bank does not consider&#13;
creditworthy, the bank can only provide credit as an agent for Government which would provide required&#13;
financial resources, assume the full credit risk, and reimburse the bank for administrative expenses.&#13;
B. Institutional Analysis&#13;
16.    Organizational Structure. RCB's network includes the Tirana head office which is currently&#13;
undergoing major repair works, branches in 33 out of 36 districts, and 130 small agencies which are&#13;
linked to district branches, making RCB the only genuinely national banking network in Albania. Total&#13;
bank staff increased from 400 as of end-1992 to 700 as of end-1994. RCB has a small management team&#13;
of 67 employees in the Tirana head office. District branches employ an average of 12 employees, with&#13;
up to 4 employees per agency. Head office staff include the General Manager and CEO, the Vice&#13;
General Manager, 25 analysts and supervisors in the credit supervision and credit review departments,&#13;
15 employees in the financial management and accounting departments, and 10 officers in the areas of&#13;
human resources, legal affairs, public relations and general services. The bank's Board of Supervisors&#13;
includes four representative of the MOF, one MAF representative, one private sector representative, and&#13;
the bank's CEO. The organizational chart of RCB's head office is attached (Appendix 1).&#13;
17.   IDA Support in Institutional Development. From February to August of 1993, the former BAD&#13;
received initial technical assistance in the areas of financial management, credit operations, and&#13;
accounting and MIS. The main objective of this early assistance was, within the policy framework of&#13;
ASAC, to prepare the liquidation of BAD and ensure the subsequent creation of RCB as of October 1,&#13;
1993. During the following first TA Phase under ASAC (total of 36 person/months, US$0.7 million),&#13;
expatriate experts assisted RCB between October 1993 and March 1994 in the areas of financial&#13;
management, credit supervision and review, accounting and MIS, human resources development, and&#13;
international banking. The main focus of this phase was on the provision of policy advise in these key&#13;
areas, with initial staff training in the credit and accounting fields. During the second TA Phase under&#13;
ASAC (total of 84 person/months, US$1.5 million, June 1994 - September 1995), foreign experts assisted&#13;
in: (i) finalization and implementation of the new accounting and financial reporting system in the head&#13;
office and branches; (ii) implementation of the new Credit Manual and credit supervision and review&#13;
&#13;

guidelines at the branch and agency level; (iii) implementation of recommendations to start up&#13;
international banking operations; and (iv) operations of the ILU. ASAC funding also provided for RCB&#13;
staff training and the purchase of office equipment, furniture and vehicles.&#13;
18.    Management and Staff Qualification.  As a result of its isolation during the communist rule,&#13;
Albania lacks any western or other banking traditions in the country's financial sector. Unlike in most&#13;
developing economies, bankers in Albania had practically no exposure to banking practices developed&#13;
elsewhere. This complete lack of knowledge transfer is responsible for the current shortage of qualified&#13;
staff and management in local banks. Concerning RCB, some staff at the branch level are fairly well&#13;
experienced with respect to the technical issues of agricultural production. However, there is a lack of&#13;
knowledge of appraising projects on financial and commercial grounds. Initial training for key branch&#13;
staff in the credit and accounting area under the above-mentioned first TA Phase of the institutional&#13;
development program under ASAC has started to improve this skill base. Further intensified training at&#13;
the branch and local level is, however, required.&#13;
19.    Lending Operations.  As of end-1994, RCB's credit customer base includes about 12,000&#13;
individuals and enterprises. Some 99.3% of RCB's credit customers are within the private sector. The&#13;
number of loan accounts, which initially increased dramatically to about 20,000 as of end-1993, fell to&#13;
about 15,000 as of mid-1995 following substantial loan consolidations and rescheduling. Loans average&#13;
about US$500 equivalent for individual farmers and some US$10,000 for agro-processing enterprises and&#13;
other corporate borrowers. The bank extends short-term and medium-term loans with maturities usually&#13;
not exceeding five years4. Loans with longer maturities would involve liquidity-related risks given the&#13;
lack of long-term deposits. RCB requires the provision of loan collateral such as buildings, machinery&#13;
and equipment, livestock, working capital, and personal guarantees. Due to the slow build-up of land&#13;
registration and titling services in the country, many farmers have no access to credit since informal&#13;
mortgages on land are not yet widely accepted.5 Loan evaluation and appraisal is performed based on&#13;
the new Credit Manual which has been substantially revised and updated with assistance from expatriate&#13;
experts. Individual crop and farm budgets and cash-flow projections are now developed for each loan.&#13;
20.    Credit Supervision and Review.  With assistance from  expatriate experts, six regional credit&#13;
supervision divisions have been established at headquarters which review large loans for subsequent&#13;
approval by RCB's Board of Directors. Smaller loans are approved by managers at the branch level, with&#13;
no loan approval authority given to individual agencies. In view of rising loan delinquencies, both a&#13;
branch-based and a credit-offer based loan approval authorization system has been introduced in 1994,&#13;
effectively taking away any loan approval authority from credit officers and branches with low loan&#13;
quality and a substandard collection performance record.  Formal authorization limits have been&#13;
established in the 1995 Business Plan. Further progress is required to segregate the responsibilities and&#13;
internal controls for loan evaluation and approval, loan administration and perfection of security, and loan&#13;
disbursement and monitoring6. By the end of 1993, the credit review department has been fully&#13;
4/      As of end-April 1995, 63.3% of RCB's outstanding loans were short-tenn loans of up to one year duration. For loom&#13;
above one year of maturity, the structure was as follows: up to 2 years (47%), 2-5 years (49%), above 5 years (4%).&#13;
5/     New legislation is underway to improve banks' ability to enforce bankruptcy of delinquent borrowers and gain access to&#13;
liquidated assets. Legislation for land sales has been passed by Parliament in July 1995, hence improving the value of&#13;
land as collateral for bank loans.&#13;
6/     Detailed recommendations regarding RCB's credit processing have been made in the September 1994 loan portfolio audit&#13;
carried out by Coopers &amp; Lybrand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.2                                        - 46 -&#13;

established and been separated from the credit supervision function, thus providing for an independent&#13;
assessment of loan portfolio quality at the branch level. Six regional credit review teams now perform&#13;
internal loan audits at the branch level; loan audits are coordinated with general internal audits performed&#13;
by RCB's internal auditors.&#13;
21.   Accounting. RCB's accounting system is based on local accounting principles and has been&#13;
revised in 1994 to take into account reporting requirements by BOA. A revised RCB accounting&#13;
procedures manual, providing for accrual-based loan accounting, has been introduced in the fall of 1993&#13;
through assistance from expatriate experts to RCB. The transformation into International Accounting&#13;
Standards for Banking Institutions (IAS 24) is at present made manually. Technical assistance is provided&#13;
to automate and standardize this conversion process. Further technical assistance addresses issues of&#13;
interbank and intra-branch payment transactions. The overall service standard and speed in processing&#13;
payments by all three state-owned banks in the country remain at a very low level, since most payments&#13;
are still cash-based and require courier services between bank headquarters. Plans by BOA to introduce&#13;
payment clearing systems, based on wire transfers and checks, do exist but remain to be implemented.&#13;
22.   Financial Management and Performance Measurement. An Assets and Liabilities Committee has&#13;
been established in late 1993 through assistance from expatriate experts. As a first task, the committee&#13;
has developed a framework to set performance-based regional lending limits for branches based on loan&#13;
collection ratios and satisfactory delinquent loans follow-up procedures. In this respect, branches have&#13;
been classified into three performance-based classes. In light of the rise in delinquent loans, RCB&#13;
management has halted incremental lending by poorly performing branches as of January 1994, with new&#13;
loans requiring prior repayment of previous loans. The new framework of performance-based lending,&#13;
in operation since mid-1994, allows for incremental lending by branches within limits determined by the&#13;
demonstrated loan collection performance of each branch.&#13;
23.   Internal and External Audit. An internal auditor and two audit staff, reporting directly to the&#13;
bank's Board of Supervisors, have been appointed in November of 1993. Internal audits have since been&#13;
performed of most branches, with the objective to perform at least one audit per branch and year. Six&#13;
regional auditors, based in branches, have also been appointed. RCB's end-1993 financial statements&#13;
have been audited by Price Waterhouse under ASAC funding. This audit did not include a detailed&#13;
review of the bank's loan portfolio, given that the bank had only been established in October 1993.&#13;
Hence, a separate portfolio review was carried out by Coopers &amp; Lybrand as of end-September 1994,&#13;
also funded under ASAC. Procurement of services for the external audit of the bank's end-1994 financial&#13;
statements, to be carried out in line with international accounting standards and financed under ASAC,&#13;
has been initiated in early 1995.&#13;
C. Financial Analysis&#13;
24.   Data Quality. The accounting system of RCB and the other two state-owned banks is largely&#13;
based on an accounting plan developed under the former centrally-planned financial regime. With the&#13;
assistance of outside experts, RCB made adjustments to introduce accrual-based loan accounting and to&#13;
convert accounting information in accordance with IAS. A new chart of accounts for banks is currently&#13;
being developed by BOA, its introduction is planned for late 1995. Despite these short-comings, in-depth&#13;
assessments of the financial position and income situation of RCB have been undertaken by external&#13;
auditors based on the bank's end-1993 financial statements; RCB's end-September 1994 loan portfolio;&#13;
and the bank's end-March 1995 financial statements. For the purpose of the further analysis, the latter&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Page 9 of 14&#13;
financials as of end-March 1995 will be used, taking into account substantial adjustments made to reflect&#13;
all perceived risks relating to potential loan losses (see Table 4).&#13;
25.    Structural Profitability Gap.  RCB's main and only interest-earning assets a.e its loans to&#13;
customers. As of end-March 1995, RCB showed some Lek 3 billion of financial items and fixed assets&#13;
which are non-interest earning, representing 62% of net adjusted total assets of Lek 4.9 billion (about&#13;
US$55 million)7. On the liabilities side, the bank's end-March 1995 deposit base of Lek 4.88 billion is&#13;
characterized by a very high proportion of retail term deposits of 12 months maturity, bearing a high&#13;
interest cost'. This implies that the bank, at its present financial structure, cannot have a positive net&#13;
interest income, before operating expenses, however well managed it is under the prevailing interest rate&#13;
regime. Estimates regarding the structural profitability gap indicated a short-fall of interest income in&#13;
relation to interest expense of about Lek 180 million (about US$2 million) in 1995 on an annualized basis&#13;
before operating expenses. Income projections for 1996 would show a worsening in the short-fall on net&#13;
interest income in successive years on the basis of both the bank's own provision levels and the increased&#13;
level of provisions applied by outside experts. This analysis suggests that the bank, as currently&#13;
structured, has no future as a going concern and requires financial restructuring in the context of&#13;
privatization, as addressed further below.&#13;
26.    Loan Portfolio and Loss Provisions. RCB's total outstanding gross loans, as of end-March 1995,&#13;
equal some Lek 3.9 billion (US$43 million). About 35% of loans are medium- and long-term loans&#13;
above one year maturity, up from 25% as of end-1993. In addition, RCB has claims on customers&#13;
relating to accrued loan interest of Lek 1.2 billion (US$13 million). Virtually all loans are allocated to&#13;
the private sector.&#13;
27.    In compliance with BOA asset classification requirements and applicable domestic loan loss&#13;
provisioning standards, RCB has made loss provisions of Lek 819 million against loan principal and Lek&#13;
479 against accrued interest, resulting in a rather impressive level of risk provisions of Lek 1.3 billion&#13;
(US$ 14 million) or 26% of total gross claims on its loan customers. Nevertheless, in order to adequately&#13;
cover the bank against risks on the basis of actually observed loan collection rates (see below), it is&#13;
estimated that an additional amount of provisions of Lek 1.2 billion against principal and Lek 400 million&#13;
against accrued interest would be required as of end-March 1995. This would bring total required loss&#13;
provisions against principal to Lek 2 billion and provisions on accrued interest to Lek 880 million.&#13;
Hence, net claims on customers would be reduced to a mere Lek 1.9 billion in principal and Lek 280&#13;
million in accrued interest, with a resulting negative impact on the bank's equity and net worth (see&#13;
below). While the increased loss provisioning levels may be overly conservative, effectively assuming&#13;
no further improvement in the bank's loan collection rates over time, they offer a worst-case scenario&#13;
with regard to the bank's financial condition, and hence a useful basis from which to restructure the&#13;
bank's assets.&#13;
7/     Non-interest eamning financial assets include Lek 1.044 billion of reserve and sight deposits with BOA, the Lek 566&#13;
million loan to BAD (reduced by Lek 32 miUion in loss provisions), a Lek 227 loan to NCB, accrued interest on loans&#13;
of Lek 280 million (gross value of Lek 1.159 bilon, reduced by provisions of Lek 879 milion), and cash of Lek 163&#13;
million.&#13;
8/     More than 75 % of the deposit base comprises medium- and long-term retail deposits which are typically rolled over on&#13;
maturity. Due to the lack of basic money transfer systems in the country, RCB's retail clients do not use RCB for retail&#13;
banking services so much as a savings bank, which imposes a relatively high cost of funds on the bank.&#13;

28.   Loan Collection Performance. Rather than analyzing the structure and ageing of arrears, in the&#13;
case of RCB it has proven to be more useful to focus on loan collection rates, given the rather rapid rise&#13;
in the bank's loan arrears since its creation in October of 1993. Quarterly loan collection rates allow to&#13;
forecast developments in portfolio arrears before an actual rise or fall in arrears is recorded. After&#13;
substantial technical assistance by external experts, since early 1994 RCB has installed an information&#13;
system providing detailed loan collection data for each of its 33 branches. Collection data reported by&#13;
branches are verified through corresponding accounting system entries of loan repayments received.&#13;
29.   The most striking feature in loan collections is the very wide disparity of loan collection&#13;
performance between branches: from as high as 90% to zero collection rate. The worst performing&#13;
branches have shown little or no improvement over the previous year and their non-performance has the&#13;
effect of depressing significantly the weighted average improvement in the loan collection performance&#13;
of the bank as a whole. RCB has acted aggressively on this issue by replacing branch managers and&#13;
prohibiting new lending by the worst performing branches. The main reasons for the large performance&#13;
variance between branches appears to be the geographical location of branches, with many poorly&#13;
performing branches situated in areas of low income and slow economic activity. Serious management&#13;
deficiencies at the branch level are another factor.&#13;
30.   Due to the high amount of attention and efforts during 1994 placed by RCB's management on&#13;
improving loan collections, the weighted collection performance in the first quarter of 1995 shows a very&#13;
significant improvement over the same period in 1994, reflecting a shift to loans issued on a more&#13;
commercial basis in the third and fourth quarter of 1994. The bank's overall weighted average&#13;
collections on current loans for the first quarter of 1995 equal 59%, and monthly collections for the&#13;
month of March 1995 were 65%. During 1994, the average payment collection rate for the year was&#13;
about 8% above the rate observed for the first quarter of the year. Assuming a similar improvement for&#13;
1995, it is estimated that between 12 and 15 of RCB's 33 branches would be profitable on lending before&#13;
deducting branch operating costs, most of which will be covered by non-fee income. This would suggest&#13;
that most of the remaining some 20 branches would require further substantial restructuring, or else&#13;
should probably act as non-lending agencies or closed down.&#13;
31.   Non-recoverable Loans and Loan Rescheduling.  A primary reason for the overall highly&#13;
unsatisfactory collection performance and arrears situation at RCB are some Lek 1.4 billion in truck and&#13;
tractor loans extended by BAD and RCB between mid-1993 and spring 1994. Based on political&#13;
motivations, the bank was asked by the authorities to approve these investment loans with a one-year&#13;
maturity, resulting in the delinquency of practically all loans extended. In addition, most farmers who&#13;
obtained such loans were in general disbelief that these loans represented actual repayable obligations,&#13;
given that agricultural lending in the past was guaranteed by the State. RCB has embarked on a&#13;
rescheduling initiative for these loans, expected to cover about 70% of the cases, with the remainder&#13;
going to legal enforcement of the overdue amount. Further loan rescheduling is envisaged for short-term&#13;
trading loans. The combined effect of these initiatives is estimated by RCB management at up to Lek&#13;
2 billion in reductions on loan loss provisions, while more conservative estimates by outside experts&#13;
suggest a net benefit in the order of Lek 500 million.&#13;
32.    Collection of ASAC Sub-loans. The situation is more encouraging regarding collections on sub-&#13;
loans financed under ASAC and approved by the ILU within RCB. A first internal credit audit on 21&#13;
sub-loans extended since mid-1994 reveals general on-time repayment of interest due during the one-year&#13;
grace period on ASAC investment loans. However, due to issues on three sub-loans where project start-&#13;
up was delayed, initial average weighted collection rates on ASAC sub-loans reach only 87% as of end-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 4.2                                        - 50 -&#13;
Page 12 of 14&#13;
August 1995. It is expected that collection rates on ASAC sub-loans will reach or exceed 90% by the&#13;
fall of 1995.&#13;
33.    OtherAssets. RCB's balance sheet as of end-1994 shows fixed assets valued at Lek 100 million.&#13;
Based on conservative market estimates, taking into account the urban location of RCB's branch offices,&#13;
a more realistic market value for the bank's real estate may be around Lek 600 million (US$6.7 million).&#13;
34.   Deposits and Due to Banks. The bank's outstanding liabilities as end-March 1995 include Lek&#13;
3.2 billion in time deposits which generally represent private household savings, and an additional Lek&#13;
1.4 billion in demand deposits of which Lek 280 million stem from state enterprises. Except for a small&#13;
credit of Lek 100 million from the SB, the bank has no other liabilities with domestic or foreign banks.&#13;
35.    Capital Adequacy. According to the BOA license, RCB's initial paid-in capital (held by MOF)&#13;
equals Lek 450 million, which is to be increased to Lek 800 million by end-1996. As of end-1994, and&#13;
in compliance with legal and regulatory provisions in Albania, the bank publishes total capital of Lek 424&#13;
million, or 8.3% of total assets at that time. Projections for end-1995 foresee a total capital to total assets&#13;
ratio of 13.5%. However, after estimated required adjustments for additional loan-related risks, and a&#13;
slightly off-setting revaluation of RCB's fixed assets, the bank's capital - under a worst-case scenario -&#13;
is estimated to be negative, with net assets falling short of liabilities by about Lek 900 million (some&#13;
US$10 million) as of end-March 1995. While collection rates on the bank's loans are likely to improve&#13;
further, thus reducing rates of risk provisions on both overdue and current loans, it is probably unrealistic&#13;
to expect the bank to generate sufficient loss provisions and return to positive capital unless it is&#13;
financially restructured.&#13;
36.   Liquidity.  The bank's ability to collect new household deposits has prevented it from&#13;
experiencing liquidity-related bottlenecks, despite its structural cash-flow gap. As soon as deposit growth&#13;
would slow down, and without any substantial progress in collecting and enforcing loan collateral on non-&#13;
performing loans, the bank might begin facing liquidity problems.&#13;
D. Outlook&#13;
37.   Need for Restructuring. After a period of rather successful initial institutional restructuring of&#13;
the bank, facilitated by outside technical assistance, RCB is now in need of financial restructuring,&#13;
combined with privatization, if the bank is to become a viable rural financial institution. The bank's&#13;
cash-flow gap can only be overcome through a replacement of non-interest bearing assets through&#13;
productive and secure assets. Furthermore, substantial improvements in the bank's internal work&#13;
organization, credit operations, accounting and financial management, and general efficiency and service&#13;
quality are unlikely to occur unless strong governance through a private, qualified banking institution can&#13;
be established.&#13;
38.   Financial Restructuring. Regarding financial restructuring, there are two main options to reduce&#13;
required loan loss provisions and improve the bank's interest income and cash-flow, both of which imply&#13;
a recapitalization of RCB through cash or interest-bearing bonds, the main source of which would likely&#13;
be the public budget. A first option would be to relieve the bank of the loan portfolio of its 10 worst&#13;
performing branches. This would reduce required loss provisions by about Lek 1.2 billion (including Lek&#13;
800 million in principal and Lek 400 million against interest); and it would reduce (eliminate) the cash-&#13;
flow deficit by about Lek 200 million per year, resulting in positive net interest revenues. A second&#13;
option would be to relieve the bank from most or all of its pre-October 1993 loans, most of which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -                                        Annex 4.2&#13;
Page 13 of 14&#13;
represent unrecoverable truck and tractor loans described above. The related benefit would be a reduction&#13;
of loss provisions by about Lek 1.5 billion and an improvement in cash-flow by Lek 270 per year. Either&#13;
solution would result in positive capital and positive annual cash-flows, making the bank viable based on&#13;
the observed improvements in loan collections and assuming a complete halt of new lending in all but the&#13;
best performing 10 branches. The estimated net cost to the budget, through issuance of bonds and/or&#13;
provision of cash, would be in the order of Lek I billion to Lek 1.5 billion (US$1l to 17 million).&#13;
39.   In addition to recapitalization, the Government has further ways to improve RCB's financial&#13;
situation. First, the BAD-related loan by RCB, guaranteed by the Government, could be made current&#13;
through payment by MOF of accrued interested estimated at about Lek 600 million, and possibly&#13;
repayment of the principal of Lek 566 million. Both actions together, and by themselves, would likely&#13;
result in the restoration of positive capital. Furthermore, Government could adequately remunerate RCB&#13;
for its services as an agent that is making pension and other public payments to residents in rural areas.&#13;
Alternatively, if Government decided to terminate RCB's agent function, the bank could close most of&#13;
those agencies that are not net contributors to RCB's bottom line.&#13;
40.    Privatization. However, financial restructuring alone, without parallel privatization, would bear&#13;
the risk of continued unsatisfactory governance and possible future losses due to politically motivated&#13;
lending. Also, as a public institution, the bank could not expect to obtain further substantial amounts of&#13;
government-funded technical assistance, hence reducing substantially prospects for further improvements&#13;
in operational efficiency.  Government and BOA are, therefore, supporting the notion of bank&#13;
privatization which, in the case of RCB, would require a strong, committed and reputable private banking&#13;
institution as an investor, able to provide qualified management and technical expertise from its own&#13;
resources. Since no such institution can be identified within the country today, a foreign strategic&#13;
investor in the banking industry would be the most desirable new owner of a privatized RCB. Various&#13;
methods of bank privatization for the state-owned banks are in the discussion, and it is expected that a&#13;
decision on the method and timing of RCB privatization would be made before the end of 1995.&#13;
41.   ILU Operations. Since its establishment in early 1994, the operations of the ILU regarding on-&#13;
lending of ASAC funds to rural borrowers are judged to be working rather well, especially when&#13;
compared to other banking institutions and donor credit windows in the country. The ILU has largely&#13;
fulfilled its objective of becoming a model for an efficient rural banking window within RCB, and ILU's&#13;
credit evaluation standards and operational procedures became the basis for revising RCB's Credit Manual&#13;
and the bank's overall credit management. If RCB was to be privatized, the ILU could remain a part of&#13;
the bank. Alternatively, if RCB was to be downsized and possibly merged with another bank, the ILU&#13;
could be transferred to this new bank as well.&#13;

ENTREPRENEURS SUPPORT PROGRAM&#13;
1.    Most Albanians have an excellent educational background and there are many well trained&#13;
technicians. However, over 50 years of a strict command economy has left significant skill gaps in the&#13;
training program, particularly for managerial, economic, marketing and financial skills. The project&#13;
would thus aim to fully utilize technical skills available in Albania and would strengthen them with&#13;
outside expertise where necessary.&#13;
2.    The project would focus on providing direct assistance to entrepreneurs and their associations and&#13;
strengthening selected local institutions for the provision of such services in the future locally. For that&#13;
purpose a Technical Services Unit (TSU), with the support of an experienced foreign firm with Albanian&#13;
counterparts has been established under the direct supervision of MAF's Agro-Processing Department and&#13;
a Project Coordination Committee (this Committee was established in July 1993). The TSU would be&#13;
supported through the provision of office equipment and vehicles, up to 40-45 person months of technical&#13;
support and training, and up to 150 person months of Albanian expertise. In the long run (at the end of&#13;
project period) the TSU is expected to be converted into a private consultive body or a Foundation&#13;
supported by the industry. In summary, the project would provide funds for the following:&#13;
*     the establishment of TSU with Albanian experts (4-6) as well as one long term foreign expert for&#13;
about 2 years, (with experience in dairy processing including marketing, and milk collection and&#13;
organization of PFAs-- with project management experience), and a number of short-term experts&#13;
in various fields as needed (Apwendix 3);&#13;
*     assistance to private agro-processing entrepreneurs, farmers and their associations in preparing&#13;
bankable proposals including feasibility studies and financial/technical plans to obtain bank&#13;
financing;&#13;
D     training of industry personnel in collection, processing, quality control, and management,&#13;
marketing and other business aspects as well as in the organization and operation of PFAs. Some&#13;
of this training would be offered overseas while capacity would be built within Albanian&#13;
institutions to provide such training locally;&#13;
*     limited assistance to the food quality control laboratories and technical institutional (such as IKU,&#13;
IVR, and IPBU) and private associations (e.g., ADA) in upgrading their equipment facilities and&#13;
skills-- to improve their capabilities to provide technical services and training to the industry&#13;
including feasibility studies, technical advice, quality control, and development of a diploma&#13;
program;&#13;
*     study tours for the selected officials and private entrepreneurs to observe collection, processing&#13;
and distribution systems and organization of PFAs.&#13;
*     assistance to farmers in organizing PFA's and in improving their management and operations;&#13;
*     assistance to the MAF in the formulation of a strategy for the promotion of PFAs; and&#13;
*     assistance to the ILU (RCB) in sub-project appraisal and supervision.&#13;

SUPPORT TO TECHNICAL INSTITUTIONS&#13;
1.    In accordance with the 1995 Food Law passed by the Albanian Parliament in May 1995, the Food&#13;
Research Institute (IKU) and the Institute of Veterinary Research (IVR) have been designated as the&#13;
Centers of Reference for the quality control of non-animal and animal origin foods, respectively. These&#13;
institutes would need to improve their capabilities (such as equipment, staff skills and procedures) in&#13;
order to carry out this mandate. The Food Research Institute and the Agriculture and Food Design&#13;
Institute have begun to refocus their activities towards providing assistance to the industry, in particular&#13;
training, product development, testing, quality enhancement, monitoring and analysis as well as granting&#13;
certificates for registration of food manufacturing enterprises. Under the proposed project, limited&#13;
assistance would be provided to the IKU, IVR and selected District Quality Control Laboratories. Their&#13;
staff skills and laboratory facilities would be strengthened on task specific scale by adding testing and skill&#13;
updating equipment and staff training. Assistance would also be provided to the IKU in developing&#13;
curricula for workshops, seminars and short term courses and advisory services. In addition, the IPBU&#13;
would be assisted in updating its skills, information database and computerized output of blueprints,&#13;
reports, feasibility studies. Assistance to the Albanian Dairy Association would be small focussing on&#13;
initial support (office equipment, vehicle and training) in first two years before it is able gain credibility&#13;
and earn its own income.&#13;
2.     Short term consultants for a few months would be engaged on various subjects (such as quality&#13;
control, training, provision of technical services, etc.) to help these institutions.  Some of these&#13;
consultants are expected to be obtained through other donor-assisted programs such as VOCA and trust&#13;
funds. Twinning arrangements with suitable Dutch organizations would be encouraged. Some of the&#13;
faculty members may be sent abroad for a study tour to the institutions running similar type of programs&#13;
to appreciate the nature and the extent of training required. Further details of support are given below:&#13;

ALBANIA: AGRO-PROCESSING DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
TSU INTERNATIONAL FIRM&#13;
TERMS-oF-REFERENCE&#13;
1.    The Government of Albania is seeking assistance from the World Bank to finance an Agro-&#13;
processing Development Project to support the development of agro-processing enterprises in the private&#13;
sector. One of the principal activities of the project would be to assist re-establishment of operational&#13;
capacity within the complex of existing, newly privatized large and small agro-processing plants.&#13;
2.    In order to support the Ministry of Agriculture and Food (MAF) in implementing the project, a&#13;
Technical Services Unit (TSU) would be established with the support of a foreign firm with Albanian&#13;
counterparts. The TSU would be responsible to the Director, Agro-processing Department (APD) of the&#13;
MAF. The TSU would have independence in implementing its agreed work program. Major focus of&#13;
TSU's work would be on the dairy industry. But it would also provide support to the agro-processing&#13;
sector as well as to the food quality control system in Albania. The foreign firm must have extensive&#13;
expertise in dairy industry management including preparation of business plans for bankable projects,&#13;
organizing milk collection, establishing private farmers associations (PFAs), product processing, plant&#13;
rehabilitation, quality control, marketing and management under conditions applicable to Albania (i.e.,&#13;
small farm holdings and small processing plants).&#13;
3.    Foreign support would include the provision of local and foreign project management and expert&#13;
support for implementing programs of private agro-processing/dairy industry investments, industry&#13;
training and quality control. This would include about 40-50 person months of high quality international&#13;
assistance (both long-term and short term) and up to 150 person months of Albanian technical support.&#13;
The long term support would be one foreign expert with experience in dairy industry for a period of two&#13;
years. The short term technical support would be provided as and when required during project&#13;
implementation period in the likely areas of food products quality control, business management, market&#13;
development, environment, agro-processing, training, etc. One of the major tasks of the international&#13;
firm would be to assist in building local capacity in Albanian institutions for the provision of similar&#13;
services to the industry.&#13;
4.     Long Term Foreign Expert. He must have extensive experience in various aspects of the dairy&#13;
industry (such as processing, project management, quality control and marketing). Additional experience&#13;
in agro-processing, milk collection and organization of PFAs would be highly desirable. This expert&#13;
would be fully responsible for all activities of the TSU. He would manage the TSU, but a majority of&#13;
his time is expected to be spent in providing direct assistance to entrepreneurs and institutions. He would&#13;
be responsible for determining, subject to World Bank review, the needs and Terms-of-Reference (and&#13;
arranging their availability) of various short term experts in consultation and agreement with the Director,&#13;
APD. He would also be responsible for the recruitment, subject to World Bank review, of 4-6&#13;
counterpart Albanian staff who would, over time, assume increasing responsibility for implementing the&#13;
project. The Albanian staff could be either individuals or an appropriate Albanian technical organization&#13;
engaged in the support of agro-industry in Albania.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The main objective of the
            Agro-Processing Development Project is to support the
            development of the agro-processing sector in Albania and to
            help improve the conditions for financing its restructuring
            through the financial sector in order to improve marketing
            of farms outputs (thereby improving rural incomes) and
            availability of food products to urban population. The
            project has two main components: 1) an entrepreneurs support
            component which includes technical assistance, equipment and
            vehicles, and training and study tours; and 2) an investment
            credit component.
