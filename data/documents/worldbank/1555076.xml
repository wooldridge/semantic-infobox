PRICE DISTORTIONS IN AGRICULTURE AND THEIR EFFECTS:&#13;
AN INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON&#13;
The central thesis of this paper is that agricultural pricing policies&#13;
pursued by developing countries produce effects which are diametrically&#13;
opposite to those produced by the pricing policies of many developed coun-&#13;
tries, and that the policies of both are costly in terms of global welfare.&#13;
In general, the agricultural sector in developing countries is heavily taxed&#13;
while that in the developed countries receives substantial price protection.&#13;
The effects of agricultural price distortions on output, consumption, trade&#13;
and rural employment are estimated for nine countries. In addition, the&#13;
effects of priee distortidns on the distribution of income between producers&#13;
and consumers, on goverunment revenue and foreign exchange, and the net social&#13;
losses of the policies are calculated. The results indicate that there are&#13;
large income transfers and impacts on migration from the rural to the urban&#13;
sector in developing countries and from the urban to the rural sector in&#13;
developed economies.&#13;
To insure proper interpretation of this paper and its policy implications,&#13;
attention is drawn to the following caveats: some secondary data is of question-&#13;
able quality and could be improved; specific methodological questions raised&#13;
in the course of this research have been inadequately addressed; the results&#13;
are based on only one year (1976); and some personal judgements were required&#13;
for determining certain data input. For these reasons the results should be&#13;
interpreted with caution. They represent orders of magnitude and should be&#13;
considered tentative. The paper is the.first phase of work in progress on&#13;
the issue of agricultural price distortions.&#13;

PRICE DISTORTIONS IN AGRICULTURE AND THEIR EFFECTS:&#13;
AN INTERNATIONAL COMPARISON&#13;
Introduction&#13;
Agriculture is the main source of food for the world, and food&#13;
is the basic input in the daily sustenance of humans. Yet in many parts&#13;
of the world there is insufficient food which in turn implies inadequate&#13;
agricultural output. The reasons for inadequate agricultural production&#13;
are many and varied, ranging from poor distribution and poor production&#13;
techniques to political intervention at various levels in the global agri-&#13;
cultural complex. The most important reason for deficient agricultural&#13;
output is difficult to ascertain, but T.W. Schultz in the first Elmhurst&#13;
Memorial Lecture to the International Association of Agricultural Econo-&#13;
mists left no doubt as to his ranking of the causes.   He suggested that&#13;
the level of agricultural production depends not so much on technical con-&#13;
siderations, but in large measure "on what governments do to agriculture." 1/&#13;
That governments intervene in the agricultural price setting&#13;
mechanism in many different ways and for assorted reasons is so obvious&#13;
as to be pedestrian. Export taxes on agricultural products provide govern-&#13;
ment revenue and keep domestic prices low, product price supports in developed&#13;
countries maintain farm incomes and provide surpluses which in turn find their&#13;
way to developing country markets to further depress domestic farm prices,&#13;
and agricultural inputs are frequently either taxed or subsidized. Yet the&#13;
magnitude of these effects on agricultural output, income distribution&#13;
between producers and consumers, efficiency and on rural employment is&#13;
often not fully appreciated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Government alteration of market incentives in agriculture can&#13;
be classified in three ways based on the output effects of the interven-&#13;
tion (after Schultz, 1978). First, there are economic policies which&#13;
are neutral with respect to the opportunity cost of agricultural production.&#13;
Second, there are cases where agricultural production is overvalued, and&#13;
finally, there are cases where agricultural production is undervalued.&#13;
There are few countries that meet the first classification and we do not&#13;
attempt to identify them here. Typically high income developed countries&#13;
fall into the second category. In this study, we examine Japan, West Germany,&#13;
France and Britain, countries where high levies are placed on grain imports,&#13;
where sugar, meat and dairy imports are highly restricted by quotas, and&#13;
where, in the case of Japan, rice is greatly overpriced. The immediate&#13;
consequence of these policies is that there is overproduction and under-&#13;
consumption of agricultural output. The third category is typically made&#13;
up of low-income developing national. Here, as examples, we examine the&#13;
pricing policies of Thailand, Egypt, Argentina and Pakistan, where export&#13;
taxes and price controls often undervalue agricultural output resulting&#13;
in underproduction. The food situation in many of these nations is such&#13;
that they cannot afford to forego such production opportunities. Finally,&#13;
we consider the case of Yugoslavia, sometimes classified as a developing&#13;
country and sometimes classified as a centrally planned economy.&#13;
This paper discusses government intervention in agricultural&#13;
price determination, drawing on welfare theory to quantify the economic&#13;
impacts on output, income distribution, efficiency and employment. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
general theme is that the agricultural policies pursued by developing&#13;
countries produce effects which are diametrically opposite to those pro-&#13;
duced by the policies of many developed countries, and that the policies&#13;
of both are costly in terms of global welfare. 2/ The paper begins with&#13;
a description of the theoretical model on which the analysis is based then&#13;
continues by detailing the data sources. The results are presented in&#13;
Section 4, followed by some concluding thoughts.&#13;
Method and Theoretical Basis&#13;
The results of the paper are derived using standard partial equi-&#13;
librium analysis in the Marshallian economic surplus framework. The method&#13;
is well known for both its usefulness and limitations. Details are not&#13;
presented here, but the reader is referred to Currie, et al for an excellent&#13;
review of the concept, to Bale and Greenshields for an application of the&#13;
method, and to Lutz and Scandizzo for a review of other studies. In this&#13;
paper the real and pecuniary effects of agricultural price distortions in&#13;
a small country case are analyzed using nominal protection coefficients to&#13;
measure the disparity between domestic prices and border prices. Typical causes of&#13;
price distortions are producer price supports, tariffs, quotas, export taxes,&#13;
input subsidies, etc. In each case, the distortion drives a wedge between&#13;
the domestic price and the world or "border" price. Domestic prices are&#13;
defined as the prices at farm and consumer levels, and border prices are&#13;
the existing "world" price at the same point in the marketing chain. Border&#13;
prices are used as the point of reference for the evaluation because they&#13;
represent the opportunity cost of the traded commodities. 3/ They are also&#13;
conveniently available as they are observed in the international market-&#13;

Data Sources&#13;
The FAO Production Yearbook is used as a source of production&#13;
levels, and imports and exports are obtained from the FAO Trade Yearbook.&#13;
Supply and demand elasticities are from Rojko et. al. with the exception&#13;
of those for rubber in Thailand that are from Behrman. Since elasticity&#13;
estimates differ widely from researcher to researcher, and because we wish&#13;
to demonstrate the sensitivity of the results to changes in elasticities,&#13;
the supply and demand elasticities presented in Table 1 are + 0.5 times&#13;
the point estimates given by Rojko et. al. and Behrman. Nominal protectior&#13;
coefficients for developing countries are based on coefficients from detailed&#13;
country case studies by Bertrand (Thailand), Cuddihy (Egypt), Gotsch and&#13;
Brown (Pakistan), Reca (Argentina), and ULG Consultants Limited (Yugoslavia).&#13;
Since some coefficients had only been estimated to 1975, adjustments were&#13;
made to obtain the nominal protection coefficients that were used in this study.&#13;
The nominal protection coefficients for developed countries were&#13;
calculated from the International Wheat Council, International Sugar&#13;
Organization, U.S. Department of Agriculture, 1979, and the World Bank, 1978a.&#13;
Note that despite the Common Agricultural Policy of the EC, NPC's of members&#13;
are not identical. This is due to the "Monetary Compensatory Amounts" (MCAs)&#13;
and "green" currencies where internal EC exchange rates in agriculture differ&#13;
from official exchange rates.&#13;
Labor/Output Coefficients are constructed from Bartsch, Palacpac,&#13;

Commission, and the World Bank, 1978b. In the case of developing countries,&#13;
marginal labor/output coefficients are derived from a labor-&#13;
intensive technology such as hand-harvesting with a bullock-drawn cart&#13;
and hand threshing. Average coefficients are simply the average of coefficients&#13;
taken from two or three different production techniques on irrigated and&#13;
non-irrigated farms. In developed countries, only average coefficients&#13;
are available.  Marginal coefficients are arbitrarily calculated as 1.5&#13;
average coefficients. The conversion rates of man-hours to full-time&#13;
worker equivalents, in hours per year, are: France, 1964; West Germany, 2315;&#13;

Results&#13;
A. Production, Consumption and Trade Effects&#13;
Agricultural pricing policies in developed and developing countries&#13;
show significant differences. While agricultural commodity prices in developed&#13;
countries generally have positive rates of protection, the agricultural sector&#13;
in developing countries is being taxed through price intervention measures.&#13;
As a result, the levels of agricultural production in industrialized nations&#13;
are higher than without intervention whereas agricultural output in less&#13;
developed countries are significantly smaller than what it would be in the&#13;
absence of distortions. In the high elasticity case, for example, France&#13;
and Germany are producing an increment of 4.3 and 2.8 million tons of wheat&#13;
respectively due to the price protection, whereas the production in Argentina&#13;
and Pakistan is discouraged with a resulting estimated decrease of 7.0 and&#13;
1.3 million tons, respectively (Table 2).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
On the other hand with consumption the picture is reversed;&#13;
developing countries consume more and developed'countries less than they&#13;
would in the absence of price intervention measures. Thus the pricing&#13;
policies clearly have a beneficial effect in providing more food for the&#13;
malnourished non-agricultural population in LDCs. If this is one of the&#13;
policy objectives of price intervention, it is achieved at the expense of&#13;
the agricultural sector.&#13;
Trade effects are merely the combination of production and&#13;
consumption effects. For the general case we find that through the pricing&#13;
policies, exports of developing countries are reduced (for exported&#13;
commodities with NPC's smaller than 1) and that for the industrialized&#13;
nations their imports are curtailed (for imported commodities with NPC's&#13;
larger than 1). In the case of imports of developing countries with NPC's&#13;
of less than 1, imports are increased by the sum of the absolute values of&#13;
the production and consumption effects. This case implies government sub-&#13;
sidies; for example for wheat and maize in Egypt. 4/ On the other hand,&#13;
export commodities with NPC's larger than 1 imply that dumping is taking&#13;
place with export subsidies necessary to bridge the gap between the internal&#13;
price and world market price. All five commodities analyzed for France&#13;
are examples of this policy.&#13;
On the basis of a small sample of countries, it is difficult to&#13;
determine what the aggregate effects of the agricultural policies are at&#13;
the world market-level. Even for a standard case where developing countries&#13;
are exporters using export taxes and where developed countries are importers&#13;
with positive rates of protection, the sign of the price impact on the world&#13;
market cannot be determined a priori since both net exports adid net imports&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
are being reduced simultaneously. Hence, it would be necessary to analyze&#13;
the policies of all trading countries of a particular commodity before the&#13;
world market price impact could be estimated.&#13;
B. Employment/Migration Effects&#13;
The process of economic development is typically associated&#13;
with internal migration from the primary sector in rural areas, to industrial&#13;
and service sectors in urban centers (Kuznets, p. 48). Economic theories&#13;
of internal human migration conceive the process as a response to differences&#13;
in employment opportunities between regions where potential migrants evaluate&#13;
costs and benefits associated with relocation and make their decision&#13;
accordingly. A primary determinant in such a decision is the relative income&#13;
opportunities in rural versus urban locations (Sjaastad, Falario). In spite&#13;
of (or because of) 5/ massive development efforts over the last decade, rural&#13;
poverty persists in many parts of the world and recent work has demonstrated&#13;
that low real income levels of farm households have in some cases declined&#13;
(Rajaraman), while various price-support measures to maintain farm incomes&#13;
are prevelant in other parts of the world. A common explanation for&#13;
rural poverty is that agricultural productivity is low because of tenancy&#13;
arrangements and limited access to modern inputs such as controlled irrigation,&#13;
chemical fertilizers, pesticides, mechanization, new varieties, credit,&#13;
extension services, etc. (Mellor). Yet such explanations avoid the issue of&#13;
the effect that product prices have on agricultural productivity and therefore&#13;
on employment and migration. Here we attempt to quantify the extent to which&#13;
product prices that are undervalued contribute to a sub-optimal rural pop-&#13;
ulation and the extent to which product prices that are overvalued contribute&#13;
to a larger-than-optimal rural population.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
We present four estimates of the agricultural employment impacts&#13;
of price distortions in Table 2. Two are based on average labor/output&#13;
coefficients using production changes calculated from high and low supply&#13;
elasticity estimates. The other two employment changes are calculated using&#13;
marginal labor/output coefficients where production changes are based on&#13;
high and low supply elasticities. There are three reasons for presenting&#13;
the results in this manner. First, we wish to demonstrate the sensitivity&#13;
of the employment effects to changes in assumptions. Second, labor coefficients&#13;
tend to be rather gross estimates from numerous secondary sources using&#13;
different assumptions and typically vary by more than 100 percent within&#13;
developing countries for different production techniques of the same crop.&#13;
Our results may be regarded as capturing the upper and lower bounds of employ-&#13;
ment changes. Third, it can be argued that under a regime of distorted prices,&#13;
the marginal operators will be displaced or expanded in response to price&#13;
changes. Thus, marginal labor/output coefficients are more appropriate in&#13;
estimating agricultural employment impacts.&#13;
Referring to the developed countries in Table 2, we see that&#13;
existing agricultural pricing policies retain significant numbers of workers&#13;
in agriculture. Japanese rice pricing policies are particularly significant,&#13;
retaining from between one half of a million workers (low supply elasticity,&#13;
average coefficient) to 2 million workers (high supply elasticity, marginal&#13;
coefficient). As a proportion of farm population, these numbers are large&#13;
(2.1 to 9.6%), and even expressed as a proportion of total population (0.4 to&#13;
1.9%) the numbers are significant. In the European countries presented here,&#13;
workers retained in agriculture are somewhat smaller both absolutely and relatively.&#13;
For example, in France, if free market prices prevailed for the five&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
commodities, between 52,987 and 241,200 workers in an agricultural labor&#13;
force of 8.6 million would be displaced. 6/ In terms of absorption into&#13;
the total work force, the numbers amount to 0.16 to 0.75%. While this may seem&#13;
to be a rather small percentage it is, nonetheless, significant. In a period&#13;
of high general unemployment even one or two points change in the unemployment&#13;
rate can involve heavy social and political costs.&#13;
In developing countries, agricultural price distortions have&#13;
the effect of reducing farm employment from that which would exist under&#13;
free market prices. In general, the absolute value of the employment effects&#13;
are larger for developing countries than for developed countries, partly&#13;
because of the labor-intensive production methods used in developing countries.&#13;
The numbers suggest the extent to which price distortions create unemployment&#13;
and stimulate migration. Using the high supply elasticity and marginal labor&#13;
coefficients in Egypt, for example, the total reduction in agricultural employment&#13;
for the four commodities is 1.15 million workers or around five percent of&#13;
the rural population. Employment in rice production accounts for a large por-&#13;
tion of this. No doubt the numbers would be considerably larger if secondary&#13;
(multiplier) effects were considered and if all commodities were covered.&#13;
Unemployment and rates of rural to urban migration that exceed&#13;
rates of urban job creation are serious problems in developing countries.&#13;
While overt unemployment is pronounced in urban centers, disguised&#13;
unemployment is prevalent in rural areas    (Todaro, Wonnacott).  Thus,&#13;
any policies that contribute to the problem, such as agricultural product&#13;
pricing policies, need to be carefully examined. The conventional lay&#13;
wisdom that if farm product prices were to increase in developing countries&#13;
poor people would be hurt needs to be scrutinized. Many of the poor are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
rural poor or former-rural residents who have migrated to urban areas in&#13;
search of better employment opportunities. Higher agricultural prices&#13;
could only assist them as farmers, landless laborers, or farm-related&#13;
workers. Viewed in a longer run dynamic context, as farmers and farm&#13;
laborers realize higher incomes their demand for urban-produced goods&#13;
and services will increase, so stimulating employment in urban areas. 7/&#13;
C. Welfare Effects&#13;
Our results indicate that the economies of the countries analyzed&#13;
incur large annual welfare losses due to a misallocation of resources&#13;
resulting from the existing agricultural pricing policies (Table 3). The&#13;
losses depend linearly on the assumed elasticities and quadratically on&#13;
the size of the price distortion as measured by a proportional tariff rate.&#13;
Total net social losses are the sum of net social losses in production and&#13;
in consumption. They range from $26 million (US) for the United Kingdom&#13;
(the low elasticity assumption) to $4,119 million for Japan (the high elasticity&#13;
case).     Even though the sample of commodities used in this analysis is&#13;
small, it is interesting to compare the estimated welfare losses to the GNP&#13;
of the countries. The results show that compared to economic output,&#13;
distortions are generally more costly in developing countries than in&#13;
industrialized nations (Table 4). 8/ Further, the results are obtained from&#13;
a partial equilibrium model. Using a general equilibrium analysis that&#13;
takes long-run consequences of the price distortions into account, the&#13;
estimated social costs would typically be considerably larger.&#13;
As our results in Table 5 indicate, the most sizeable effects&#13;
of the different agricultural policies are the welfare transfers between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
consumers and producers. While the farm sector of the developing countries&#13;
studied was taxed from about $700 million to about $2 billion annually,&#13;
the producers in developed countries receive large transfers due to&#13;
protection. In Japan, where the average rate of protection is the highest,&#13;
farmers gain between $2.6 and $5.1 billion for the total of the five major&#13;
commodities analyzed. 9/ Consumers in the developed countries incur&#13;
large welfare losses due to price protection whereas the consumers in&#13;
developing countries generally gain from this type of price intervention.&#13;
With the exception of France , all countries acquire increased&#13;
government revenues from their interventionist policies. Thus, the fact&#13;
that most governments gain from price distortions confirms that government&#13;
revenue generation is an objective of price intervention.&#13;
The effects on foreign exchange earnings are again clearly&#13;
divided along different levels of development. While industrialized nations&#13;
gain foreign exchange through protectionist policies, developing countries&#13;
lose foreign exchange earnings. This is particularly serious in that foreign&#13;
exchange availabilities represent a major bottleneck for developing countries&#13;
in their efforts to increase growth and alleviate poverty.&#13;
Conclusions&#13;
What emerges from this paper is the vital role that farm product&#13;
prices play in achieving optimum output and productivity growth. Because&#13;
"incorrect" price signals are being given to farmers, allocative, production,&#13;
and consumption potentials are not being realized. In many cases, the estimated&#13;
changes in production greatly alter trade patterns, in some cases causing&#13;
importing countries to become self-sufficient, and in other cases causing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
"would-be exporters" to become importers. The magnitude of income transfers&#13;
and efficiency losses (net social losses) is also impressive, both as an&#13;
absolute number and as a proportion of national income. The rural employment&#13;
effects of price distortions, while perhaps less impressive than the welfare&#13;
losses, are nonetheless serious, given the high unemployment rates in&#13;
developing countries and the political sensitivity of agricultural&#13;
employment in developed countries.&#13;
The ultimate question about agricultural pricing policies is their&#13;
dynamic effects. Here we have seen the size of the static effects but our&#13;
model (and the state of technology of our profession) does not allow us to&#13;
estimate accurately price distorting effects on income and industrial growth,&#13;
adoption of technology, investment in agriculture, social consequences, etc.&#13;
While decision-making at the public level is not by agricultural economists,&#13;
but by politicians, our profession plays a vital role in defining and&#13;
quantifying the issues involved, and in extending these findings to appropriate&#13;
officials. Our hope is that this paper is in that tradition.&#13;

1/ Schultz has long been the most ardent and eloquent spokesman of this&#13;
position.  See, for example, Schultz 1964, 1976 and 1978.&#13;
2/ A recent study which addresses the developing country side of this&#13;
question in a somewhat different manner is Peterson.&#13;
3/ We recognize that the general equilibrium effects of removing price&#13;
distortions on a global basis would alter border prices and therefore&#13;
alter the magnitude of the distorting effects. However, it is extremely&#13;
difficult to estimate "shadow free market prices" in a first-best&#13;
world, and we do not suppose that we will ever be operating in a&#13;
first- or even second-best environment.&#13;
4/ Parts of the imports may not be subsidized directly by the government&#13;
of Egypt but may be the result of shipments at concessionary terms.&#13;
5/  "....  the most promising attack on employment problems in developing&#13;
countries is in efforts to redress the present urban bias in development:&#13;
strategies" (Edwards).&#13;
6/ We do not wish to render the labor estimates useless by presenting&#13;
numbers which have such a large variance, but we do want to present&#13;
realistic upper and lower bounds. We invite the interested reader to&#13;
select his "most-likely" elasticity and labor/output estimates and&#13;
thereby generate a deterministic labor number.&#13;
7/ We are indebted to Willis Peterson for suggesting this point.&#13;

sector in developing countries than in developed countries. Figures on&#13;

            Price distortions in agriculture and their
            effects : an international comparison
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The central thesis of this paper is that
            agricultural pricing policies pursued by developing
            countries produce effects which are diametrically opposite
            to those produced by the pricing policies of many developed
            countries, and that the policies of both are costly in terms
            of global welfare. In general, the agricultural sector in
            developing countries is heavily taxed while that in the
            developed countries receives substantial price protection.
            The effects of agricultural price distortions on output,
            consumption, trade and rural employment are estimated for
            nine countries. In addition, the effects of price
            distortions on the distribution of income between producers
            and consumers, on government revenue and foreign exchange,
            and the net social losses of the policies are calculated.
            The results indicate that there are large income transfers
            and impacts on migration from the rural to the urban sector
            in developing countries and from the urban to the rural
            sector in developed economies.
