A. BACKGROUNDAND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
1. ProjectRationale&#13;
&#13;
Agriculture i s central to the Afghan economy.' The sector contributes to more than half o f GDP (53&#13;
percent) and provides employment for two-thirds (67 percent) o f the labor force. Nearly four out of&#13;
five Afghans live in rural areas, which also harbor the highest incidence o f poverty. Agricultural&#13;
performance i s thus pivotal to overall economic growth and poverty reduction, and offers the only&#13;
significant prospect for raising farmer incomes. It contributes to food security, provides rural&#13;
employment,        and reduces the vulnerability o f resource-poor rural people. Accordingly,&#13;
development o f the agriculture sector i s a central pillar o f the government's strategy for economic&#13;
growth and poverty reduction.&#13;
&#13;
However, Afghanistan's agriculture has suffered badly from nearly a quarter century o f prolonged&#13;
conflict and unrest. The main drivers o f agricultural growth and rural poverty reduction-roads                  and&#13;
irrigation, technology, information and education, and markets-have                   all deteriorated because o f&#13;
social conflict, lack of maintenance for infrastructure, and collapse o f technical information and&#13;
market systems. This situation has been exacerbated by frequent droughts. Between 1979 and&#13;
2004, agricultural production grew at 0.85 percent per year, compared to 1.1percent per year inthe&#13;
pre-conflict period of 1964-78. To enable faster overall economic growth and also to reduce rural&#13;
poverty significantly, agriculture needs to grow at a minimumrate o f 5 percent per year over the&#13;
next decade.&#13;
&#13;
The Poppy Economy&#13;
&#13;
In conditions of lawlessness and impoverishment, opium has become Afghanistan's leading&#13;
economic activity and a main source o f livelihood for many rural people. In 2004 and 2005,&#13;
Afghanistan supplied the overwhelming share (an estimated 87 percent) o f the global market for&#13;
opiates. Starting from a tiny base in the late 1970s, poppy production peaked in 1999 and has&#13;
continued at high levels, apart from a brief respite under a ban imposed by the Taliban regime in&#13;
2000. Poppy production resumed after the regime collapsed and i s now the leading economic&#13;
activity, accounting for about one-third o f GDP. Although concentrated in three regions, poppies&#13;
are cultivated in all parts o f the country. Production peaked in 2004, with 6.6 percent o f the&#13;
irrigated land (an estimated 131,000 hectares percent). This production involved more than one-&#13;
third of all farmers (35 percent, or some 356,000 farmers). Inthe absence of comparable sources of&#13;
income, poppy production provides a substantial part o f the welfare o f rural households inthe main&#13;
production areas, where the majority o f the populace are resource-poor.&#13;
&#13;
The opium industryinvolves nearly one in five people (an estimated 4 million people, 17 percent of&#13;
the total population) and indirectly supports 870,000 jobs in the rural nonfarm economy. Breaking&#13;
this illicit economy will depend on finding alternative sources o f income for producers and the&#13;
 traders involved. However, there are few non-farm opportunities through which licit economic&#13;
 growth can be supported. Therefore, alternatives must be found in crop and livestock production&#13;
 and agricultural processing and marketing. The futility o f proposing field crops as competition i s&#13;
 apparent when comparing the net margins for poppies, ranging from $1,600 to $2,30O/ha (with an&#13;
 average farm gate price o f $102/kg in 2005) and $180/ha for wheat. By focusing on high-value&#13;
 horticulture and livestock products and emphasizing small-scale farmers, the Horticulture and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Agriculture GDP includes livestock,forestry, and fisheries, but excludesthe opiumpoppyeconomy.Figures are for&#13;
 2003. Ifthe poppyeconomy is included, the share of agriculture in the drug-inclusive GDP i s muchhigher: 70 percent:&#13;
 Labor force figures above are for 2001.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                  5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Livestock Project (HLP) will make a positive contribution to the government's counter-narcotics&#13;
policy. The improved security and relations between Afghanistan and the rest o f the world since&#13;
2002 have opened up opportunities in producing, processing, and marketing horticulture and&#13;
livestock products.&#13;
&#13;
2. GovernmentStrategy for the AgricultureSector&#13;
&#13;
The role o f agriculture as the central pillar for rural development i s explicitly recognized in the&#13;
Interim Afghanistan National Development Strategy (I-ANDs). A five-year strategic framework&#13;
and benchmarks for the agricultural sector are contained inthe "Afghan Compact," presented at the&#13;
London Conference in February 2006. The framework calls for: (i)                establishment o f the necessary&#13;
institutional, regulatory, and incentive framework to increase agriculture production and&#13;
productivity; (ii)creation o f an enabling environment for legal agriculture and agriculture-based&#13;
industries; (iii) a 30 percent increase o f public investment in agriculture; and (iv) particular&#13;
consideration to perennial horticulture, animal health, and food security. To achieve these goals, the&#13;
Ministryo fAgriculture and Irrigation (MAI)prepared an Agriculture Sector Development Strategy&#13;
(Master Plan).' The plan has been adopted by the government as the cornerstone for achieving the&#13;
five-year benchmark targets for the agriculture sector and for ensuring sustainable economic growth&#13;
and improved livelihoods in rural areas. However, there are three main constraints to achieving&#13;
these benchmarks.&#13;
&#13;
First, before the onset of war (1977), horticulture (fresh and dried fruits) represented a substantial&#13;
portion (41 percent) o f Afghanistan's export earning^.^ Although the sector was neglected during&#13;
the next 25 years, cultivated areas increased in response to demand from population growth and&#13;
increased local and regional demand, including the Soviet republics, according to survey data.&#13;
Development of the global horticultural industry has been exceptional since 1977. However,&#13;
Afghanistan has not benefited from recent innovations in selection, technological innovations, or&#13;
marketing and its horticulture i s now uncompetitive.&#13;
&#13;
Nonetheless, the perennial horticulture sector offers great potential both for growth in the&#13;
agriculture sector and for enhancing rural incomes for several reasons: (i)             Afghanistan i s a land-&#13;
locked country and its comparative advantage lies in the valuelweight ratio o f its perennial&#13;
horticulture products; (ii)   there i s a growing demand from the Indian subcontinent, where the scope&#13;
for producing temperate fruits crops i s limited; (iii)    the genetic potential o f Afghan fruits i s unique;&#13;
(it.)perennialhorticulture offers higher returns than alternative, licit agriculturalproducts; and (v)&#13;
perennial horticulture creates a demand for goods and services inthe non-farm rural economy.&#13;
&#13;
 Second, livestock have traditionally been an integral part o f most o f the country's farming systems.&#13;
Range pasture, which covers nearly half (45 percent) o f the total land area, has traditionally&#13;
 supported a large livestock population. Pastoralist livestock populations declined by more than half&#13;
 (50 percent) due to the pressures o f war whichdisrupted the nomads' traditional trekking routes and&#13;
because o f successive droughts between 1998 and 2001. Inevitably, this reducedthe availability of&#13;
 sheep for fattening, the mainstay o f meat supplies to urban centers. It also adversely affected the&#13;
nutritional inputs and increased the vulnerability o f the rural population, particularly pastoralists.&#13;
&#13;

and approved by the Cabinet o f Ministers inDecember 2005.&#13;

41% o f the value o f all exports. Dried fruit represent 18% o f total exports comparedto 12% for fresh fruit&#13;
and 11% for nuts" (World Bank, 1977, "Horticultural Subsector Survey. Afghanistan. Volume I,"&#13;
Agricultural Credit and Agro-industries Division, Report No 1324-AF, Washington, DC, p. 28).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                             6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
With reduction inhostilities and the returnof favorable rains, sheep and goat populations have been&#13;
recovering since 2002.      Thus it is particularly timely to support the recovery and growth o f&#13;
livestock production. Poor nutrition in livestock directly contributes to increased incidence o f&#13;
animal diseases and low fertility, even when vaccines and other animal heath interventions are&#13;
available. Addressing these issues i s indispensable for achieving the government's development&#13;
goals.&#13;
&#13;
Third, the war has resulted in a serious erosion of government institutions, their infrastructure and&#13;
facilities, and staff capacities and skills. This has prevented the government from providing an&#13;
effective technical assistance to the agriculture sector in general and to the horticulture and&#13;
livestock subsectors in particular. The available staff lacks modem training and has been prevented&#13;
from acquiring information on state-of-the-art technologies and extension practices for improved&#13;
production and productivity o f the sector. While the private sector can potentially play a lead role&#13;
in providing technical and financial assistance and marketing support to enhance trade,&#13;
productivity, and income in agriculture, its potential has not been harnessed to date. Enhancing the&#13;
State capacity to create an enabling environment and facilitating the private sector to provide&#13;
support to horticulture and livestock production are vital for the future growth o f these two&#13;
subsectors.&#13;
&#13;
To address these issues, in early 2005, MA1urgently requested World Bank assistance to jumpstart&#13;
agricultural production. A Bank mission visited Afghanistan in March 2005 and prepared a three-&#13;
year strategy, which was reflected in the Agriculture Master Plan. The strategy identified three key&#13;
areas as priorities for investment: (i)&#13;
                                      increasing productivity from existing irrigated wheat areas; (ii)&#13;
supporting the production and marketing o f high-value horticultural crops by revitalizing orchards&#13;
and putting in place a framework for improving quality management and marketing channels; and&#13;
(iii)developingaseries ofmeasuresto addressanimalhealthandproduction, improverangeland&#13;
management, and ensure adequate fodder availability. The HLP i s the Bank's response to support&#13;
these priorities and to increase synergies with ongoing and related donor programs in the country.&#13;
&#13;
B. IDA RESPONSEAND STRATEGY&#13;
&#13;
 1.InterimStrategyNoteFramework&#13;
&#13;
 The HLP is consistent with both the government's I-ANDs and the Bank's Agriculture Strategy&#13;
 Document (March 2005). It also aims to put into action the horticulture and livestock chapters of&#13;
 the Agriculture Master Plan, in coordination with other donors. It will make specific contributions&#13;
 by: (i) stimulating increased and more efficient production from perennial horticulture crops and&#13;
 livestock; (ii)demonstrating improved technical approaches for these subsectors; (iii)initiating&#13;
 improvements in genetic quality o f livestock and perennial crops; and (iv) strengthening human&#13;
 resources inMA1(see appendix 1, Results Framework and Monitoring).&#13;
&#13;
 2. Lessonsfrom ExperienceinAfghanistan and Similar Countries&#13;
&#13;
 The design for HLP i s based on proven techniques and traditional practices in horticulture and&#13;
 livestock production, achievements by development projects inthe prewar period o f the 1970s, and&#13;
 results from technical operations supported by various aid agencies since the mid-1990s.           In&#13;
 addition, the design has drawn on Bank-supported projects in other countries that have similar&#13;
 ecological conditions for perennial horticulture and livestock.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PerennialHorticulture&#13;
&#13;
Perennial horticulture has always been important to Afghanistan. Many tree crop species originated&#13;
inthis part ofthe world. Perennial tree crops have consistently beenmore profitable than other licit&#13;
agricultural products. Exports o f fresh and dried fruit and nuts have been the major source o f&#13;
revenue to the Afghan economy for centuries. In the 1970s, the World Bank and other donors&#13;
financed institutional and production projects aimed at strengthening the horticulture sector.&#13;
However, with the onset o f protracted hostilities, Afghanistan failed to benefit from improvements&#13;
in production and processing achieved in other parts of the world. Instead, many orchards were&#13;
destroyed, while others deteriorated.&#13;
&#13;
Inthe rnid-l990s, the Foodand Agriculture Organization (FAO) initiateda horticulture programas&#13;
part o f the PEACE Initiative. It focused on food security and emphasized apple production by&#13;
establishing small nucleus nurseries. However, it lacked conceptual work on orchard systems and&#13;
crop budget analysis. Over the years, FA0 has also provided support for integrated pest&#13;
management (IPM) on crops.&#13;
&#13;
The proposed approach for the horticultural production activities under HLP i s based on research&#13;
and development work carried out in the 1970s and resumed in 2002. A pilot project extending&#13;
over 200 hectares was launched in Jalalabad in 2004-05 by two NGOs (CNFA and IFHope), with&#13;
the aim o f encouraging farmers to invest in 1 hectare per farm o f perennial orchard and adopt&#13;
modem production techniques. This pilot identified several keys to success in promoting new&#13;
orchards:&#13;
&#13;
    0    The quality o f fruit tree seedlings i s critical for convincing farmers to forgo production o f&#13;
         staple crops and create an orchard on part o f their land.&#13;
&#13;
    0    Farmers taking the risk to plant orchards require specialist technical assistance for&#13;
         preparation and implementation.&#13;
&#13;
         Cover cropping with alfalfa helps compensate for reduced income while orchards are&#13;
         establishing. Alfalfa also provides a source o f nitrogen, helps counter pests, prevents&#13;
         erosion, and increases supplies o f livestock fodder.&#13;
&#13;
The IFHope model i s limited by the fact that it i s based on orchard systems and research from&#13;
Pakistan. While this i s relevant to some parts o f Afghanistan, other regions differ significantly. For&#13;
potential developments in the west and north, for example, it i s more appropriate to draw on&#13;
experience from Iran and other countries with agro-ecological conditions similar to Afghanistan,&#13;
Developments in China, the Indian subcontinent, and Turkey since the 1970s have involved major&#13;
investments in production, processing, and marketing technologies, resulting in state-of-the-art&#13;
perennial fruit industries. With its strong traditions and reputation, Afghanistan will be able to meet&#13;
the challenge o f finding market outlets for increased horticultural production.&#13;
&#13;
Livestock&#13;
&#13;
Livestock and agriculture have considerable traditional, social, and economic importance in&#13;
Afghanistan. Moreover, the country has uneven climatic conditions. World Bank experience with&#13;
livestock development in such situations demonstrates the need for a balance between extensive and&#13;
mixed farming production systems. This helps ensure the best use o f scarce and variable feed&#13;
resources and promote optimum livestock productivity relative to the comparative advantages o f the&#13;
country. Evaluation o f Bank-financed projects also demonstrates that farmers will adopt production&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     8&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
growth and marketing initiatives when a secure production environment exists, including a&#13;
favorable regulatory framework and effective and accessible veterinary services and technical&#13;
advice.&#13;
&#13;
InAfghanistan, several lessons are apparent from the last 40 years. Inthe 1970s, the country was&#13;
self-sufficient in meat and milk and enjoyed significant exports o f animal fiber and high-value&#13;
processed products (carpets and skins garments). By contrast, today, imports o f frozen chicken,&#13;
eggs, and dairy products are growing rapidly; average meat consumption i s less than 10 kg per&#13;
capita per year. Added to this, the exodus o f people because o f the war created a vacuum that&#13;
permitted a large part of the added value o f traditional animal products processing and products to&#13;
be captured by neighboring countries. There i s therefore an urgent need to increase protein&#13;
production to help redress poor diets and eliminate imports.&#13;
&#13;
The survival o f traditional nomadic livestock production systems depends on natural pastures inthe&#13;
hills during spring and summer and the capacity o f traditional lowland reserve lands duringwinter.&#13;
Decades o f civil unrest have affected Afghan pastoralists more than other livestock owners. Not&#13;
only have the numbers o f flocks fallen by half, but flocks have been excluded from rangelands by&#13;
new cultivators and have become increasingly vulnerable to contagious diseases. As a result,&#13;
natural pastures-particularly   highlyproductive summer pastures-are      being poorly managed. The&#13;
incidence o f environmental degradation through the encroachment o f seasonal agricultural activities&#13;
has accelerated in the last five years. There i s urgent need to promote dialogue between local&#13;
communities and national authorities. Inparticular, it i s necessary to explore ways for communities&#13;
to agree on fair regulations on livestock movement and access to natural pastures in the context o f&#13;
concerted pasture management plans, including exclusion o f cultivators from agreed access areas.&#13;
&#13;
Animal Health Services&#13;
&#13;
Government veterinary services that were available to Afghan livestock owners before 1979 were&#13;
decimated by the conflicts that followed. Starting in the late 1980s, various donor funded NGOs&#13;
and international agencies-led    by FA0 and the United Nations Development Program (UNDP)-&#13;
tried to provide a minimum o f veterinary services (as emergency operations) by training&#13;
community-based veterinary paraprofessionals and establishing Veterinary Field Units (VFUs). In&#13;
the 1990s, various aid agencies provided clinical veterinary services in the private sector as a&#13;
 support operation for district-based VFU. However, these efforts were not sufficiently widespread&#13;
to prevent a decline inoverall animal health and fertility.&#13;
&#13;
 Since 2001, donor-funded NGOs have shifted the emphasis from the relief mode to the&#13;
 development o f a sustainable national network o f privatized VFUs that provide regular veterinary&#13;
 care on a fee-for-service basis. The aim i s that VFUs should operate as independent private sector&#13;
 operators for livestock owners, as well as contracting some government regulatory oversight. Some&#13;
 500 VFUs have been created with the assistance o f various aid agencies. Inaddition, there are 120&#13;
 government veterinary clinics that are poorly operating and need to evolve into private sector&#13;
 operations in accordance with government policy on privatization. Collectively, the VFUs and&#13;
 clinics will provide a strong basis for a national network o f private clinic service delivery to&#13;
 livestock owners. The NGOs involved with VFUs have started to coordinate their operations.&#13;
Notably, a start has been made to reduce the level o f subsidies for salaries and vaccines, thereby&#13;
 addressing the main reason for lack o f sustainability for VFUs in the past. Actions under HLP will&#13;
 further consolidate VFU and help them become profitable and more sustainable.&#13;
&#13;
 A technical assistance project supported by the European Commission (EC) is studying the&#13;
 financial implications for the VFUs, including eventual complete privatization o f the associated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  9&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
veterinary services.    An Animal Health Development Project (AHDP) funded by EC will be&#13;
initiated in2006 with the objective o f strengthening public sector veterinary services through policy&#13;
formulation, updated regulation, planning, and increased capacity for laboratory diagnostics and&#13;
disease control. Complementing these activities, H L P aims to revise and strengthen the regulatory&#13;
framework, facilitate the transfer o f MA1 veterinary clinics to private operation, and further&#13;
strengthen cooperation o f the publidprivate sectors in veterinary medicine through provision o f&#13;
contracts for sanitary mandates by MA1to private practitioners.&#13;
&#13;
The continued expansion o f VFUs into an autonomous network i s uncertain, as EC contracts with&#13;
two leading NGOs will end in 2007. However, it i s hoped that funding from the U.S. Agency for&#13;
International Development (USAID) for these development will be renewed in 2006 to create a&#13;
national network. At the same time, it i s important to ensure continued technical support while&#13;
subsidies are being phased out. This will enable the NGOs concerned to hand over technical&#13;
support and the supply and supervision o f the VFUs to a permanent Afghan professional association&#13;
operating under a legal mandate.&#13;
&#13;
The Afghanistan Veterinary Association (AVA) was established inthe 1990s with FA0 assistance.&#13;
After overcoming initial organizational challenges, the AVA i s developing into a successful service&#13;
association that assures delivery o f most o f the VFU network's medicine and equipment supplies. It&#13;
i s also an active partner in the veterinary field unit development project that has been funded by&#13;
USAID through the Rebuilding Agriculture Markets Program (RAMP) and led by the Dutch&#13;
Committee for Afghanistan (DCA). At present, AVA directly manages 115 VFUs in 14 provinces&#13;
in Southern and Eastern Afghanistan. The RAMP project has supported the strengthening of AVA&#13;
through institutional reforms and reorganization. By extending the ongoing reorganization and&#13;
capacity building under HLP, the AVA will become a sound professional organization, able to&#13;
coordinate effectively between its members and the government veterinary services. This will&#13;
provide a framework for developingpublic-private partnership inveterinary service delivery.&#13;
&#13;
Animal Husbandrv Services&#13;
&#13;
Incontrast to animalhealth, farmers havehadlittle support for improvinganimal productionsince&#13;
the 1970s. Pilot projects for poultry and dairy development were initiated in 2000 and are being&#13;
implemented by FA0 with bilateral funding.              These projects have generated substantial&#13;
improvements in livelihood and nutrition, particularly in the poorest communities and for women,&#13;
thus stimulating strong interest among the rural populations. Expanding such activities would help&#13;
 address social and production objectives and curb import substitution. In addition, there i s scope&#13;
 for fostering other types o f livestock production, especially sheep fattening, animal fiber, and&#13;
pastoral livestock production.&#13;
&#13;
 Improving animal production will require modem and well-trained technical support services.&#13;
However, because o f decades o f neglect, the operations o f the General Department for Livestock&#13;
 Protection and Development (GDLPD) are weak and disorganized. Personnel lack relevant&#13;
knowledge, appropriate training, and necessary facilities. Reorganization of MA1services has been&#13;
 delayed, pending the implementation o f the public sector Priority Reform and Restructuring (PRR)&#13;
 initiative, which i s supported by the Bank and other major donors. Developing the capacities o f&#13;
 animal production and marketing services will be central to any reorganization o f the Ministry,but&#13;
no aid agency has committed to provide technical support.&#13;
&#13;
Lessons Reflected in the Project Design&#13;
&#13;
Four main lessons have been reflected inthe design o f the HLP:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  10&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         Public regulatory capacity, support capacity, and technical advisory capacity are essential to&#13;
         create an enabling environment for the development o f private initiatives in horticulture,&#13;
         animal health, and production.&#13;
&#13;
         A coordinated technical assistance and training program facilitate early start up of&#13;
         development operations and increases the capacity o f Afghans in both the public and&#13;
         private sectors.&#13;
&#13;
         Direct involvement and ownership o f the concerned rural communities in the organization&#13;
         and management o f production and marketing operations are essential for ensuring&#13;
         ownership and sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
         High-quality technical support services to farmers and traders help ensure expected&#13;
         outcomes and long-term sustainability. In the short-term, this will most likely involve&#13;
         contracting specialist private sector organizations and NGOs.&#13;
&#13;
3. Rationalefor IDA Involvement&#13;
&#13;
There are four main reasons why the Bank should be strongly supportive at this stage. First, the&#13;
government gives high priority to World Bank involvement in the agricultural sector-as         reflected&#13;
in its request for assistance in preparing the strategy document in March 2005 and subsequent&#13;
discussions about the Agriculture Master Plan. Second, it i s widely recognized that increased&#13;
productivity and growth in the (non-opium) agricultural sector will be an important component o f&#13;
the strategy for reducing the opium economy-although          action on several other fronts, including&#13;
interdiction, will also be needed. Third, the Bank, together with other aid agencies (DFID, ADB,&#13;
USAID) i s already supporting projects in irrigation (the Emergency Irrigation Rehabilitator Project,&#13;
E m ) and rural development (including the National Solidarity Program, NSP; the National&#13;
Emergency Employment Program, NEEP; and the Microfinance Investment Support Facility in&#13;
Afghanistan, MISFA). The HLP will complement these operations and maximize the development&#13;
effectiveness o f investments in rural development by enhancing agricultural production and&#13;
productivity and improving agricultural technologies and markets. These interventions will also&#13;
enhance the prospects for sustainability o f the ongoing operations. Fourth, because o f its strong in-&#13;
country presence and development leadership in several other sectors, the Bank i s well positioned&#13;
to encourage donor collaboration in rural development, thereby helping to accelerate agricultural&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;
C. DETAILED PROJECTDESCRIPTION&#13;
&#13;
1.ProjectObjectives&#13;
&#13;
The project aims to stimulate marketable output o f perennial horticulture and livestock in focus&#13;
areas by: (i)  improving the incentives framework for private investments; and (ii)      strengthening&#13;
institutional capacity inagriculture.&#13;
&#13;
The project is designed as the first stage in a program that will unfold over the coming decade to&#13;
support the horticulture and livestock subsectors nationwide. The program has been designed in&#13;
collaboration with other donors under the umbrella o f the MA1Master Plan, with the expectation o f&#13;
obtaining additional financing and adopting common approaches                   and procedures        for&#13;
implementation.&#13;
&#13;
At project maturity (4 to 7 years after initiaiion), it is expected that improvements inthe production&#13;
capacity of the horticultural and livestock sectors will be well established (interms o f quantity and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    11&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
quality), that market channels for Afghan produces will have been improved, and that aggregate&#13;
export volumes will have begun increasing. Women farmers will particularly benefit from project&#13;
activities through the major role that they play in horticulture and livestock production. The project&#13;
will have a positive impact on broad-based economic growth in focus rural areas by increasing the&#13;
demand for output from the rural non-farm sector and from multipliers in farmers' expenditure. On&#13;
the institution front, project support for the restructuring o f MA1will help develop the basis for a&#13;
strong policy, regulatory, and support framework for the agriculture sector. Overall, these benefits&#13;
will contribute to the Bank's goals to reduce rural poverty and to implement the alternative&#13;
livelihoods program. They will also provide a key element o f a counter-narcotics strategy by&#13;
fostering an alternative to poppies and by stimulating rural incomes through support to small-scale&#13;
farmers and through expansion o f the rural non-farm sector.&#13;
&#13;
2. Project Components&#13;
&#13;
Project financing will provide for three components to: (i)      increase productivity and marketable&#13;
output o f perennial horticulture; (ii)&#13;
                                      increase productivity and improve output o f livestock; and (iii)&#13;
strengthen the associated MA1departments, implement the project, monitor progress, and evaluate&#13;
impact.&#13;
&#13;
3. ProjectDescription&#13;
&#13;
Component 1:IncreasingMarketableOutputof PerennialHorticulture(US$23.7million)&#13;
&#13;
This component will provide civil works, goods, services, and grants to: (i)rehabilitate existing&#13;
orchards and establish perennial tree crop cultivations; (ii)    establish a Horticulture Development&#13;
Council o f Afghanistan (HDCA) and develop MA1 capacity for policy planning and supporting&#13;
horticulture producers; and (iii)  support pilot activities in private sector export clusters for green&#13;
raisins and pomegranates. Expenditures will be directed at developing a modem horticulture&#13;
production capacity, including technical and degree training for specialists working in the&#13;
subsector; specifying sanitary regulations for fruit crop production; supporting varietal selection of&#13;
perennial tree crops and establishing state-of-the-art tree nurseries for distributing seedlings to&#13;
qualifying farmers; and providing extension support for rehabilitating orchards and developing new&#13;
orchards. Technical assistance would support these activities. The horticulture investments under&#13;
the project are estimated to have incremental impact within 7 years, depending on species (1 to 2&#13;
years for nurseries; 2 to 3 years for existing orchards; and 4 to 7 years for new orchards).&#13;
&#13;
 1.1Rehabilitation and Expansiono f Perennial Tree Crop Cultivation (US$20.7 million)&#13;
&#13;
This subcomponent aims to increase production and productivity of tree crops through four&#13;
activities: (i)defining orchard systems and fruit crop production programs (see explanation below);&#13;
(ii)helpingfarmers rehabilitate existing orchards through training and extension support on modem&#13;
technologies and IPM; (iii)selecting the best pathogen-free fruit tree varieties for nursery&#13;
production; and (iv) helping farmers establish new orchards. The first phase project will focus on&#13;
parts o f selected districts in Parwan, Kapisa, Kabul, Logar, Baghlan, Jawzjan, Samangan, Sari Pul&#13;
or Balkh Provinces. Women farmers play an important role inproduction o f high value products,&#13;
especially intensive livestock rearing. If the security situation permits and funds are available, the&#13;
project will expand to Southern Region, especially Hilmand and Kandahar inPY3.&#13;
&#13;
To maximize impact under a comprehensive rural development strategy, the detailed planning for&#13;
this subcomponent will coordinate with areas o f focus and investments of other projects supported&#13;
by the World Bank and other donors (notably EC, DFID and ADB). Inparticular, project actions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   12&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
will benefit from the synergies o f developments under the NSP, EIRP, MISFA, and NEEP. This&#13;
subcomponent supports four inter-related activities.&#13;
&#13;
    i. Studiesonorchardsystemandfruit cropproductionprograms. Asabasisfordevelopinga&#13;
       modem and competitive horticulture industry, project actions will help establish fruit crop&#13;
       production programs based on international experiences from leading countries in the&#13;
       region and adapted to conditions inAfghanistan. Many existing orchards and vineyards are&#13;
       run down and are not geared to intensive and competitive production. Defining the best&#13;
       orchard systems for each fruit commodity i s critical for creating a competitive perennial&#13;
       horticulture industryin Afghanistan. Project funding will provide for conducting research&#13;
       on orchard management systems by international and Afghan horticulturists and for&#13;
       developing extension material inDari and Pashtu. Fundingwill also be provided to prepare&#13;
       an atlas o f landcover (Landcover Atlas) which i s required for area-based planning and&#13;
       project monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
    ii.Rehabilitating existing orchards that were abandoned or destroyed during decades of&#13;
       conflict. Project financing will enable facilitating partners (FPs) to work with MA1&#13;
       provincial offices and develop training and extension support to help farmers adopt best&#13;
       practices in fruit and nut production and post-harvest treatment. Best practices will include&#13;
        applying integrated pest management (PM) and improved orchards management&#13;
       techniques (to increase the quantity and quality o f harvested fruit) and soil analysis (to&#13;
        define optimum fertilizer applications).     Community Development Councils (CDCs) and&#13;
        other community organizations will be instrumental in informing farmers' groups and&#13;
        fostering interest in potential beneficiaries. This subcomponent will start in Project Year&#13;
        (PY) 1, with the target o f rehabilitating 12,000 ha and achieving 10 percent yield increase&#13;
        and significant improvement in quality. The 12,000 ha o f rehabilitated orchards (8,000 ha&#13;
        grapes, 3,500 ha almonds, and 500 ha pomegranate) are estimated to generate annual gross&#13;
        income equivalent to $6.1 million and create some 200,000 additional man-days o f&#13;
        employment annually for horticultural production.&#13;
&#13;
    iii.Establishingfruit treenurseries.ThefewperennialtreenurseriesoperatinginAfghanistan&#13;
        are generally producing poor quality seedlings. Quantities are insufficient for developing a&#13;
        modem, intensive perennial horticulture. Working with the MA1 Research Department,&#13;
        project financing will fund investigations to identify superior varieties o f fruit trees, mainly&#13;
        from Afghanistan but also from other countries with similar ecological conditions.&#13;
        Selected local germplasm will be treated through thermo-therapy in laboratories and&#13;
        multiplied to produce certified, virus-free fruit tree seedlings. This will be a precursor to&#13;
        contracting with private farmers to establish seven, state-of-the-art commercial tree&#13;
        nurseries covering about 70 ha and producing over 5 million seedlings during the course of&#13;
        the project and 7 mother stock nurseries in collaboration with the EC-supported horticulture&#13;
        project. Project funding will also be provided to create demonstration orchards with&#13;
        suitable farmers inthe vicinity o f each nursery.&#13;
&#13;
    iv. Establishing new orchards. Seedlings from newly established nurseries in a package with&#13;
        fertilizer, legume seeds, and other inputs will be supplied to selected farmers, with the&#13;
        target o f creating 5,000 ha o f new orchards, starting in PY2. Under longer-term program&#13;
        support, it i s anticipated that production on newly established orchards will reach 10,000 ha&#13;
        per year from PY5. On this basis, the program would stimulate the establishment o f 70,000&#13;
        ha o f orchards within 10 years, thereby fulfilling the target set in the Master Plan. Project&#13;
        financing will also fund 200 extension agents in the three regions. They will be trained to&#13;
        organize farmer field schools to help beneficiaries establish orchards and develop optimum&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    13&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
         management techniques. Grants for inputs for new orchards will be provided to farmers on&#13;
         a sliding scale based onjevibs (1jevib    -0.2ha),   so as to ensure inclusion o f small-scale&#13;
         farmers. Beneficiaries will contribute with land, labor, and a percentage o f the costs. Where&#13;
         necessary, microcredit through MISFA or other facilities will be mobilized by community&#13;
         organizations (outside the project).&#13;
&#13;
The 5,000 ha o f new orchards to be established under the project will generate an estimated annual&#13;
gross income equivalent to U S 2 2 million at full production: 5 to 10 years after planting, depending&#13;
on the fruithut species. In addition to increased output, the new orchards will create some 685,000&#13;
man-days o f employment for rural communities. This represents nearly 340,000 more man-days&#13;
than wheat production from the same area. Intercropping orchards with legumes such as alfalfa will&#13;
be encouraged, both for improving soil quality and as a source o f winter fodder or cash income,&#13;
This will provide an estimated 50,000 tons o f additional fodder annually,&#13;
1.2 Horticulture DeveloDment Council o f Afghanistan (HDCA) (US$1.7 million)&#13;
&#13;
This subcomponent aims at developing a modem and competitive horticulture industryand helping&#13;
establish the HDCA, with mixed private and public governance. The Council will: (i)        support MA1&#13;
by advising on the preparation o f legislation and national policies; and (ii) support services&#13;
                                                                              provide&#13;
to private sector growers, traders, and processors. Starting with grapes and almonds, support&#13;
services will expand to cover other varieties o f nuts and fruit, vegetables, flowers, and medicinal&#13;
plants, as H D C A develops.&#13;
&#13;
Initially the Council will be established as a publicly funded organization. Over five years, it will&#13;
be transformed into an autonomous private members' organization. A detailed proposal for setting&#13;
up HDCA has been prepared (appendix 2), discussions on the roles o f the Council have been&#13;
initiated, and a workshop was held in March 2006 with representatives o f all potential stakeholders&#13;
to review and adopt the founding principles. Project funding will provide for qualified personnel,&#13;
vehicles, equipment, and operating costs to enable H D C A to undertake the following tasks:&#13;
&#13;
     i. DeveloptheCouncilasasoundinstitutionthatcanpromotethehorticulturesectorby:&#13;
&#13;
              Researching and debating horticulture-related issues and proposing policy actions to&#13;
              the government&#13;
&#13;
              Developing specific activities and services to support horticultural producers, such as&#13;
              training, demonstrations, overseas visits, advice, information, and technology transfer&#13;
&#13;
              Developing specific activities and services to support associations o f horticultural&#13;
              processors, traders, and other buyers, such as marketing research, training, advice,&#13;
              information, visits, trade missions, and exhibitions&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
              Encouraging programs and providing incentives for promoting and increasing&#13;
              national and export horticultural produce sales.&#13;
&#13;
A proposed structure for the Board o f Directors o f the Council has been drafted in appendix 2. A&#13;
 specialist FP with proven experience in running similar organizations and projects will be&#13;
contracted to work with MA1in establishing H D C A and ensuring that its policy analysis activities&#13;
and support services to member growers and traders are initiated and operated effectively and in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   14&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
line with its articles o f incorporation and bylaws. The Board will operate as a Steering Committee&#13;
for the horticulture production subcomponent. The Council will employ a Chief Executive Officer&#13;
(CEO), who will be responsible for liaising with the Board, managing day-to-day activities o f the&#13;
Council, and coordinating the agro-technical, marketing, training, information, and business&#13;
development support activities to growers, traders, and processors. He/she will also be responsible&#13;
for coordinating implementation o f the horticultural production activities o f HLP. Recruitment o f&#13;
the CEO will be the responsibility o f the FP, following a limitedtender procedure. Final contracting&#13;
for the CEO will be subject to approval o f the Council Board.&#13;
&#13;
     ii.Capacitybuildingbystrengtheningsupportservicesforhorticulturalgrowers,traders,and&#13;
         processors, including the following:&#13;
&#13;
             Developing technical messages for dissemination to producers, traders, and&#13;
             processors on improving production, post-harvest practices, and marketing&#13;
&#13;
             Supporting the preparation, collection, and dissemination o f information about&#13;
             technologies, suppliers, markets, buyers, and the like&#13;
&#13;
             Organizing, encouraging, and coordinating training, demonstrations, and study visits&#13;
             for growers, traders, and processors&#13;
&#13;
             Facilitating trade missions and the attendance o f grower association representatives&#13;
             and market operators at food, agriculture and related exhibitions, conferences, and&#13;
             workshops&#13;
&#13;
             Training in the preparation o f farm business plans and credit/grant applications and&#13;
             specific agronomic and post harvest practices&#13;
             Conducting and analyzing markets research&#13;
&#13;
             Fostering strong linkages among horticultural inputs suppliers, traders, processors,&#13;
             and other buyers to reduce imports and promote exports&#13;
&#13;
             Encouraging industry certification, quality improvements, and added value activity in&#13;
             horticultural production,&#13;
&#13;
As the functions of HDCA evolve, members will pay annual fees. The Council will obtain&#13;
 additional revenues from fees charged for provision o f specialist services. Within seven years, this&#13;
 income i s expected to be sufficient to cover the Council's operating costs and to enable it to become&#13;
 a credible and sustainable authority. Initially, the FP inputs will be intensive. However, from PY2,&#13;
 the FP will emphasize the transfer o f its responsibilities to the Boardpresident or CEO so that,&#13;
 within three years, the Board is able to carry out its responsibilities efficiently, with minimal&#13;
 external technical support. A Business Development Division (BDD) will be created within the&#13;
 H D C A to ensure sustainability o f the Council's activities, deal with membership recruitment issues,&#13;
 advise on planning and financing for new activities, and broaden its base o f activities and income,&#13;
 The BDDwill also: (i)     manage and monitor HLP funds for horticulture development in accordance&#13;
 with procedures to be established by the Implementation Management Support Team (IMST) (see&#13;
 discussion below); and (ii)   be responsible for managing a grant facility to be provided under HLP,&#13;
 and for fostering links with credit organizations to support proposals for upgrading production,&#13;
 improving post-harvest and marketing technologies, and stimulating local initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    15&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.3 Pilot Activities on the Green Raisin and Pomegranate Export Clusters (US$1.3 million: IFC,&#13;
USS0.9 million; IDA, US$0.4million)&#13;
&#13;
The Afghanistan green raisin and pomegranate export cluster is a group o f producers, private&#13;
enterprises, and public institutions operating in the Afghan dried fruits and nuts industry. Planned&#13;
to start in PY3, this subcomponent will be linked to IFC's Private Enterprise Partnership (PEP-&#13;
MENA). The security situation permitting, it will focus interventions on improving production,&#13;
processing, and marketing o f Shindokhani green raisins and pomegranate in Kandahar province.&#13;
These products attract the highest value in export markets. To exploit these comparative advantages&#13;
however, production, quality, processing, and marketing need to be improved significantly. To this&#13;
end, project financing will provide for technical assistance, studies, and works for constructing&#13;
simple drying facilities. A three-tiered approach will be used.&#13;
&#13;
    i. Improveproductivity of grapes andpomegranates through technology transfer: Project&#13;
         actions will help farmers improve raisin processing through more efficient drying&#13;
         techniques adopted from lead producing countries (Iran and China) and fruit treatment and&#13;
         handling of pomegranates.&#13;
&#13;
    ii.Developverticallinkagesbetweenfarmers andtraders:Projectactionswillsupporttraders&#13;
         in establishing or strengthening linkages with producers to improve efficiency and&#13;
         continuous quality control throughout the supply chain, and to ensure the sustainability o f&#13;
         new practices. As a result, penetration to key export markets, particularly in Asia, will&#13;
         improve.&#13;
&#13;
    iii.Improveexportearningsfor shindukhani raisinsandpomegranate: Improvedproduction&#13;
         and quality o f grapes will enable traders to obtain better access to export markets,&#13;
         especially in the Asian subcontinent. Through HDCA, traders will benefit from market&#13;
         research, trade fairs, branding, and modern trading technologies. Based on lessons from&#13;
         these pilot operations, post-harvest developments would be expanded under the 10-year&#13;
         horticulture and livestock program.&#13;
&#13;
Staffingfor the HorticultureProductionSubcomponent&#13;
&#13;
A specialist organizational FP will be contracted to work with MA1 in establishing HDCA.&#13;
Specialist horticultural production FPs will be contracted to work with the MA1strategic research&#13;
center in each region and in liaison with provincial MA1 offices to ensure that horticultural&#13;
production activities are implemented in a timely way and in accordance with agreed&#13;
implementation manuals. The FPs will support MAI field operations and provide the following&#13;
internationally recruited specialists: (i)&#13;
                                         an experienced regional coordinator; (ii)horticulturist who&#13;
                                                                                      a&#13;
will focus on one or two commodities and the nurseries; and (iii) junior IPM officer. These&#13;
                                                                           a&#13;
specialists will be recruited on the basis of precise, results-oriented terms o f reference. The FPs will&#13;
work alongside the following national staff to carry out field operations: (i)two qualified and&#13;
experienced regional horticulture coordinators; and (ii)     two regional IPM coordinators. The pilot&#13;
activities in the green raisin and pomegranate clusters will require the FP to bring on board a&#13;
specialist international horticulturist and two national horticulturists to coordinate technical&#13;
activities on Shindukhani raisin and pomegranate, and two national development officers. The&#13;
recruitment o f all specialists would be closely coordinatedwith similar activities supported by other&#13;
aid agencies.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
assigned to support the creation o f HDCA and to oversee the production subcomponent. Regional&#13;
FPs will work with the MA1 strategic research centers, the private nurseries, and the IPM&#13;
coordinator to: (i)coordinate the selection o f mother stocks o f lead Afghan varieties to be&#13;
multiplied in the nurseries; (ii)select and contract private investors to establish nurseries; (iii)&#13;
provide technical assistance and quality control to private nurseries; (iv) train extension staff in&#13;
orchard establishment and management, and integrated pest management, as supported by a&#13;
specialized organization such as FAO; and (v) coordinate extension activities. These teams will&#13;
work initially through qualifying extension agents from existing MA1 staff and, if necessary,&#13;
additional agents recruitedby the FP for the duration o f the project.&#13;

            producers, wholesalers, processors, and buyers o f finished products. Project financing&#13;
            will beprovided for the following:&#13;
                 Contracting a FP specialist to work with provincial offices in surveying potential&#13;
                 for production o f raw materials, product quality, and marketing channels&#13;
&#13;
                 Organizing research between international and national specialists to determine the&#13;
                 main product quality factors and to design extension messages&#13;
&#13;
                 Training herder communities in collecting and cleaning techniques for best quality&#13;
                 cashmere fiber to obtain better returns and provide opportunities for further local&#13;
                 processing, such as hand spinning&#13;
&#13;
                 Organizing annual workshops on raw and finished products between producers;&#13;
                 and fostering traders and foreign buyers and national fairs.&#13;
&#13;
There i s strong consumer demand for poultry and dairy products. Production i s predominantly&#13;
small scale and surpluses from domestic consumption are sold in local markets. This provides an&#13;
important source o f cash for small-scale farm families. Some farmers sell to traders for transport to&#13;
urban centers. Imports o f these products are organized by traders generally linked with neighboring&#13;
countries.&#13;
&#13;
Other Potential Subcomponents&#13;
&#13;
Sheep fattening activities will be an important and financially attractive part o f the longer-term&#13;
horticulture and livestock program but will not be financed under HLP. This i s the case for two&#13;
reasons. First, such activities require a credit facility, which cannot be provided under HLP.&#13;
Second, they relate more precisely to pastoralist development. Consideration will be given to the&#13;
possibility o f supporting a comprehensive, free-standing project for pastoral communities when&#13;
socio-economic studies under an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) assistance are complete&#13;
(Grant # TF0.54983 to National Land Commission for Building Capacity to Address Land-Related&#13;
Conflicts and Vulnerability in Afghanistan). Once sustainable procedures for animal production&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 20&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
have been established, the project would initiate a sheep fattening subcomponent to provide training&#13;
for groups o f women and men farmers and technical support for production and related services.&#13;
&#13;
2.3 Animal Health Services     (USS5.4 million)&#13;
&#13;
This subcomponent aims to promote public-private partnership for the delivery of veterinary&#13;
services by: (i)specifying policies and regulations for the conduct o f private veterinary practice and&#13;
the role of paraprofessionals, as well as for importing, distributing, and administering veterinary&#13;
medicines and vaccines; (ii)  creating a system o f sanitary mandate and delegating implementation&#13;
o f some disease control functions to private veterinarians; (iii)  supporting the transfer o f the 120&#13;
MA1 veterinary clinics to private sector operation; and (iv) developing the capacity o f the&#13;
Afghanistan Veterinary Association (AVA) to strengthen the veterinary profession, particularly&#13;
with regard to members working in the VFU system. The latter will include developing four&#13;
regional AVA offices and training centers.           The subcomponent will thus help reduce the&#13;
dependency o f VFUs on NGOs and donors and will help finance the restructuring and&#13;
reinforcement o f AVA. Project action will also initiate a sanitary mandate system for contracting&#13;
certain government veterinary activities to private veterinarians, thereby reinforcing their revenue&#13;
base and increasing their profitability. Project financing will be provided for the following:&#13;
&#13;
        Developing official policies on the definitions, roles, and responsibilities o f different&#13;
        categories o f animal health care providers, including professionals and paraprofessionals&#13;
&#13;
        Training activities to enhance the technical capacity o f Afghan veterinarians for providing&#13;
        services inthe public and private sectors&#13;
&#13;
        Harmonizing the privatized VFU clinical services system, including the privatization o f&#13;
        government clinics supported and supervised by AVA&#13;
&#13;
        Establishing sanitary mandates through MA1 Veterinary Department contracts with&#13;
        professional veterinarians or certified private paravets (with AVA to negotiate terms o f&#13;
        contracts)&#13;
&#13;
        Providing vaccines, disease surveillance equipment, and supplies necessary for conducting&#13;
        contracted sanitary mandates.&#13;
&#13;
Staffing for the Livestock Component&#13;
&#13;
The Minister MA1has been requested to assign a qualified senior officer as counterpart to the&#13;
Livestock Specialist responsible for implementing this subcomponent. For the development of&#13;
animal health services, drafting o f revised legislation and mandates will be the responsibility of the&#13;
Veterinary Department, supported by international specialists.            The Dutch Committee for&#13;
Afghanistan (DCA) will be employed to help coordinate operations o f VFUs under AVA's unified&#13;
system. For the animal production subcomponents, developments would be focused on newly&#13;
reorganized AHD personnel at MA1headquarters and provincial offices through strategic research&#13;
centers in Central and Northern Regions. Proven FPs will be employed primarily to train qualifying&#13;
women extension workers. Initial selection will be made from MA1staff at provincial and district&#13;
offices. Trained extension workers will foster the development o f farmers groups and support the&#13;
development and demonstration o f modem productiontechniques with participating farmers.&#13;
&#13;
Expected Results of the Livestock Component&#13;
&#13;
At project completion, the livestock component is expectedto have obtained the following results:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   21&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        A strong and effective publidprivate sector partnership will be established for the delivery&#13;
        o f animal health services; a restructured AVA will be capable o f ensuring sustainable&#13;
        operation and coordination o f veterinary service providers through a national network o f&#13;
        self-sufficient VFUs; and an agreement between the government and AVA will enable&#13;
        VFU staffto carry out sanitary mandates for government on a contractual basis.&#13;
&#13;
        Legislation specifying the responsibilities o f the MA1 Veterinary Department and the&#13;
        restructured AVA will have beenpresented to parliament for approval.&#13;
        A reorganized DAHwill provide training, adapted extension messages, and demonstrations&#13;
        in all provinces, procedures for monitoring trends in livestock productivity will improve,&#13;
        and assistance will be offered for production and marketing initiatives and investments&#13;
&#13;
        The nucleus for improving quality o fruminant breeding stock will have been established.&#13;
&#13;
        Dairy producers-organized      at the village, district and provincial levels-will be capable o f&#13;
        managing the collection, processing, and marketing o f milk and dairy products, and&#13;
        providing cattle feed and other inputsto livestock owners.&#13;
&#13;
        Poultry production-coordinated      at the village level-will    be improved through modem,&#13;
         small-scale poultry production enterprises run especially by women farmers and/or&#13;
        producers associations&#13;
&#13;
         Pilot operations will be underway with modern harvesting techniques and improved quality&#13;
         o f cashmere fiber, with producers better integrated with processors and receivinghigher&#13;
        returns&#13;
&#13;
         Ways to improve rangelands management and the livelihood o f the pastoral populationwill&#13;
         have been demonstrated.&#13;
&#13;
Component 3: CapacityBuilding, Implementation,andMonitoringandEvaluationSupport&#13;
(US$6.0 million)&#13;
&#13;
This component will provide goods, services, and incremental operating costs for developing&#13;
human and physical capacity in policy formulation, programming development, financial&#13;
management and procurement, supervising and monitoring, and evaluating impact.                 This will&#13;
enable MA1to ensure efficient implementation o f the HLP and other projects.&#13;
&#13;
3.1 Institution Strengthening&#13;
&#13;
This subcomponent aims to strengthen MAI's central administrative capacity through two&#13;
activities:&#13;
&#13;
    (i)Humanresourcesdevelopment. TheMinistryisundergoingafundamentalreorganization&#13;
         aimed at creating a simplified, modem, and forward-thinking institution capable o f&#13;
         providing effective leadership in planning, regulating, and supporting the commercial&#13;
         agriculture sector. This i s a massive challenge. HLP will provide financing for intensive&#13;
         training and management support to strengthen the Policy and Planning Department (PPD),&#13;
         which i s responsible for the development budget, and for helping the newly reorganized&#13;
         Technical Production and Animal Health Departments provide modem, demand-based&#13;
         support services for farming communities.&#13;
&#13;
    (ii)Office rehabilitation.      Significant progress has been made in restoring the MA1&#13;
         headquarters buildingsinKabul, totally destroyed duringthe war. Project financing will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    22&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
        provided to rehabilitate, furnish, and equip offices necessary to implement the project's&#13;
        planning, administration, and monitoring activities effectively.&#13;
&#13;
3.2 Project Management&#13;
&#13;
    (i)Projectmanagementavvangements.Thissubcomponentwillprovideandsupporttechnical&#13;
        assistance for project and program implementation.         Financing will be provided for&#13;
        recruiting: (i)a highly qualified lead Facilitating Partner and forming an Implementation&#13;
        Management Support Team (IMST), working as part o f the Policy and Planning&#13;
        Department and housed at MA1 Headquarters; and (ii)proven specialists (NGOs or&#13;
        international organizations) as FPs to coordinate implementation o f technical field&#13;
        operations through two strategic research centers in Central and Northern Regions and in&#13;
        collaboration with MA1provincial offices. Project financing will include equipment and&#13;
        vehicles necessary to carry out this work.&#13;
&#13;
    (ii)Monitoring and evaluation. The IMST will strengthen the existing capacity o f the&#13;
        Monitoring and Evaluation Section o f PPD by establishing a Management Information&#13;
        System (MIS). Activities under the MIS will include: (i)      financial monitoring o f project&#13;
        procurement, disbursement, budget and contract management; and (ii)technical and&#13;
        economic monitoring to measure the impact o f project developments on the basis o f agreed&#13;
        indicators related to measurable project objectives (appendix 1). Such indicators will be&#13;
        included in quarterly progress reports o f the implementing institutions responsible for the&#13;
        different components and will be the basis for deciding upon adjustments to the&#13;
        subcomponents.&#13;
&#13;
D. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECTIMPLEMENTATION&#13;
&#13;
1. InstitutionalArrangements&#13;
&#13;
The H L P will be executed by MAI, with the support o f FPs. As a result o f more than two decades&#13;
o f conflict, exodus o f trained personnel, neglected training institutions, low pay, and lack o f&#13;
exposure to modem technologies, the government's institutional capacity i s generally very weak.&#13;
Under the Priority Reform and Restructuring Program (PRR) process, MA1has been requested to&#13;
propose a simplified structure for the Ministry to the Independent Commission for Restructuring&#13;
and Reform (ICRR). In early 2005, MAI's leadership initiated a review o f alternative approaches&#13;
for reforming the Ministry. In response, a proposal was submitted to the Commission for a&#13;
structure comprising six departments (Policy and Planning, Administration, Agricultural Production&#13;
and Extension, Quality Control, Natural Resources, and Food Security). This process has reduced&#13;
the number o f departments from thirteen to six. Detailedjob descriptions have been prepared for the&#13;
highest positions (ranks 1 to 3, on a 1to 10 scale) and generic descriptions for posts at grades ranks&#13;
4 to 10. With the objective o f attracting qualified people from the largest possible pool, the PRR&#13;
process ensures that most senior posts (grades 1to 3) are widely advertised.&#13;
&#13;
It is expected that this process will be accompanied by an action plan for rationalizing staff&#13;
numbers, with the aim ofhalving the number o fMA1staff and assigning the most competent people&#13;
to specific jobs within the departments, on the basis o f a competitive recruitment process.&#13;
However, these steps have been held in abeyance because o f confusion over hiring o f several&#13;
hundred additional staff for the Ministry, as well as the submission o f a second organizational&#13;
proposal (August 2005).       Personnel recruitment has therefore been limited to competitive&#13;
recruitment o f higher level posts (grades 1 to 3).     MA1 department heads have been selected,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  23&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
together with some provincial directors. A detailed exercise i s underway to define the operations o f&#13;
GDLPD.&#13;
&#13;
The MA1operations are currently supported by some 30 international advisers, mostly assigned by&#13;
bilateral and multilateral institutions with the responsibility for managing development projects&#13;
(FAO, USAID/RAMP, DFID and EC) or as policy advisors. In addition, the Minister's cabinet&#13;
includes some 15 to 20 Afghan advisers, many o f whom are returnees who have contemporary&#13;
work experience from other countries. Decision about the Ministry's structure and staffing are&#13;
critical to the proposed institutional strengthening under HLP.       Personnel from the technical&#13;
departments have been directly involved in identifying and preparing the project proposals.&#13;
&#13;
Overall Implementation&#13;
&#13;
The Implementation Management Support Team (IMST) i s planned as the vehicle through which&#13;
MA1can most effectively manage, coordinate, and supervise both the Horticulture and Livestock&#13;
Project (HLP) and horticulture and livestock developments supported by other aid agencies. The&#13;
IMST will be part o f the MA1Policy and Planning Department (PPD), which i s responsible for&#13;
planning and managing the development budget. To develop strong planning and administrative&#13;
capacity within MAI, responsibility for the IMST will be outsourced to a lead Facilitating Partner&#13;
(FP) with a proven record in implementing developments similar to HLP. This i s considered to be&#13;
the swiftest means o f building professional capacity in MA1departments and ensuring efficient&#13;
project implementation. The General Director PPD will be the Director o f H L P and the IMST will&#13;
be headed by a Project Manager, who will be responsible to the Director General PPD for overall&#13;
project implementation. The IMST will be part o f the General Directorate PPD and a Deputy&#13;
General Director will be appointed to work alongside the Project Manager to ensure competent&#13;
organization and supervision o f program developments after H L P i s completed.&#13;
&#13;
The IMST will consist of a small team o f professional specialists (planning, accounting,&#13;
procurement, monitoring, and training) that will have the following responsibilities:&#13;
&#13;
     0   Coordinating the preparation o f annual work programs and budgets for project activities&#13;
&#13;
     0   Overseeing all aspects of project implementation, including coordinating the planning and&#13;
         supervision o f the two technical components and personnel training&#13;
&#13;
     0   Providing regular progress reports and monitor the impact o f project activities&#13;
&#13;
     0   Ensuring sound       financial  monitoring,  procurement,     disbursement,     and contract&#13;
         management.&#13;
&#13;
These specialist personnel will work alongside and strengthen the capacities o f trained Afghan&#13;
personnel. In addition, two highly experienced Horticulture and Livestock Specialists will be&#13;
assigned to IMST to help coordinating the respective Project components.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation o f Technical Components&#13;
&#13;
Facilitating Partners with knowledge o f the country and with a proven experience inthe respective&#13;
areas will work with MA1personnel to implement the horticulture and livestock components. The&#13;
FPs will consist o f Afghan and internationalNGOs, internationalinstitutions, or firms. They will be&#13;
recruited by MA1to be responsible for delivering technical and human resources development in&#13;
the project areas. Depending on capacity and distances involved, individual FPs could be contracted&#13;
to undertake these activities inmore than one location.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 24&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
For horticulture developments, the existing Horticulture Steering Committee (HSC) will be the&#13;
basis for establishing the Horticultural Development Council o f Afghanistan (HDCA). A&#13;
horticulture organization specialist FP, working alongside HSC, will have dual responsibility: for&#13;
organizing the formation o f the Council and for coordinating technical developments in the field.&#13;
Within three years, the HSC will become the permanent Secretariat of HDCA. Livestock&#13;
developments will be organized through farmers' groups in liaison with MA1provincial agricultural&#13;
offices.   The existing Livestock Steering Committee (LSC) will provide a forum for agreeing&#13;
activities between MA1and other donors and for exchanging ideas on developments.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation o f field production o f the horticulture subcomponents o f HLP will be responsibility&#13;
o f separate FPs working through designated MA1 strategic regional research centers (SRC) in&#13;
Central and Northern Region. The FPs will involve a team o f technical and organizational&#13;
specialists working alongside Afghan counterparts. They will organize their work through the SRCs&#13;
and in liaison with provincial MA1 offices. These teams will work with community authorities&#13;
(Community Development Councils, Shuras, and farmers groups/cooperatives) to recruit and train&#13;
farmers. AVA will be contracted as FP supported by a specialist FP to implement the animal health&#13;
component. Similar specialist organizations will be contracted as FPs to work with GDLPD in&#13;
planning, coordinating and supervisingthe livestock production subcomponents.&#13;
&#13;
The primary roles o fFPs will be to:&#13;
         Identify locations for project operations in the designated provinces and select farmers&#13;
         groups as the vehicle for implementingthe project&#13;
&#13;
         Collaborate with local communities (CDCs, where they exist) in their project area to&#13;
         develop and transfer information on project activities to farming communities and to&#13;
         identify suitable beneficiaries for project activities&#13;
&#13;
         Prepare detailed annual work programs for their assigned tasks, in collaboration with&#13;
         farmers groups and MA1provincial offices&#13;
&#13;
         Ensure the recruitment, training, and supervision o f men and women technical field staff in&#13;
         their project area&#13;
&#13;
         Organize training for farmers and livestock owners and provide technical assistance to&#13;
         communities during implementation&#13;
&#13;
         Contract with selected farmers to develop fruit tree nurseries in accordance with precise&#13;
         technical and quality mandates&#13;
&#13;
         Coordinate the supply and distribution o f crop and livestock production inputs to&#13;
         participating farmers&#13;
&#13;
         Maintain records o f physical and financial activities and conduct monitoring and reporting&#13;
&#13;
The following outputs are expected from the FPs:&#13;
         The plannedtargets for horticulture and livestock components will be achieved&#13;
         A set o f manuals for implementing horticulture and livestock sub components will be&#13;
         developed&#13;
&#13;
         A cadre o f competent technical operators will be created in the project areas. The human&#13;
         resources o f MA1staff assigned to the project will be strengthened-particularly     women&#13;
         technical field staff, which will be critical for achieving project objectives&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                25&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Performance-based Contracting&#13;
&#13;
The contract with the lead FP and technical FPs will be based on monitorable outputs and, where&#13;
required, renewable annually. The MA1 will hold the lead FP accountable for timely planning,&#13;
contracting o f FP support, coordinating the preparation o f annual work programs and budgets,&#13;
ensuringtraining programs for counterpart personnel, and monitoring the impact o f agreed project&#13;
activities. The FPs will follow implementation approaches that they consider the most suitable for&#13;
helping individual farmers, groups o f farmers, and livestock owners achieve the planned technical&#13;
and financial objectives. The H L P will hold the FPs accountable for performance against output&#13;
targets.&#13;
&#13;
Linkages with Other World Bank-financed Proiects&#13;
&#13;
The design o f HLP draws on the technical and organizational experiences o f similar developments&#13;
in Afghanistan. Foremost is the National Solidarity Program (NSP), through which some 10,000&#13;
village-based Community Development Councils (CDCs) have been created. CDCs act as the&#13;
fulcrum for mobilizing communities and for planning and organizing rural infrastructure&#13;
developments. They each have a bank account and the officials receive training. To date, about half&#13;
the rural population of Afghanistan benefits from CDC development activities. NSP activities are&#13;
planned to reach all rural areas inAfghanistan by 2008.&#13;
&#13;
Where feasible, HLP operations will be focused on locations where CDCs exist, thereby benefiting&#13;
from their organization to inform, mobilize, and assist in training potential men and women&#13;
beneficiaries. Similarly, to the extent possible, planning for horticulture activities under HLP will&#13;
coincide with developments under the Emergency Irrigation Rehabilitation Project (EIRE') and the&#13;
National Emergency Employment Program (NEEP), so as to benefit from rehabilitated irrigation&#13;
schemes and rural roads. The Microfinance Investment Support Facility in Afghanistan (MISFA) i s&#13;
expected to be an important option for providing farmers with small loans to provide their in-cash&#13;
contribution to investments. For institution building, the project will draw on the experience o f&#13;
PRR. Project assistance for pastoralist communities will depend on Institutional Development&#13;
Fund(IDF) support for the Land Commission for exploring means for reconciling access rights and&#13;
joint utilization o f communal pastures. Project support for green raisin production would link with&#13;
entrepreneur developments being supported by IFC. The National Steering Committee (see below)&#13;
represented by the anchor ministries o f these ongoing Bank programs (Ministry o f Agriculture,&#13;
Animal Husbandry and Forestry, MAI; Ministry o f Rural Rehabilitation and Development&#13;
(MRRD),Ministry of Energy and Water (MEW), and Ministryof Finance, MOF) will play a lead&#13;
role to ensure strong coordination and synergy among the Bank projects.&#13;
&#13;
There i s no provision for farmer credit in HLP; however, where farmers request such assistance,&#13;
CDCs and other community authorities will be encouraged to make direct links with MISFA and&#13;
other micro credit agencies.&#13;
&#13;
Collaboration with Development Activities o f Other Aid Agencies&#13;
&#13;
The proposed HLP production activities draw on experience gained from similar technical&#13;
developments in recent years by other multilateral and bilateral donors in Afghanistan, and on the&#13;
Agriculture Master Plan, to which several donors have contributed. At the same time, the planned&#13;
developments will mesh with continuing and new projects in the horticulture and livestock sectors&#13;
agreed by other donors, especially EC, USAID, ADB and DfD. A Livestock Steering Committee&#13;
has been effectively fostering collaboration between different development activities since 2004&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                26&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
under the chairmanship of GDLPD. The Committee is an informal group involving associated&#13;
technical departments and representatives o f various projects and interested donors.&#13;
&#13;
Project Governance&#13;
&#13;
It is proposed that the Minister MAAF arrange for the inter-ministry Steering Committee that has&#13;
been established to advise on the National Solidarity Program (NSP) to be extended to act in a&#13;
similar capacity for overall program policy formulation and direction for the Horticulture and&#13;
Livestock Project. The Steering Committee will approve annual work programs and budgets and&#13;
assess monitoring and evaluation reports from project implementation, as well as help ensure swift&#13;
resolution to problems encountered during implementation. The Steering Committee will include&#13;
representatives from MAI, MRRD, MIWRE, and MOF, as well as donors and UN agencies. The&#13;
Steering Committee will meet at least twice a year to:&#13;
&#13;
      0   Review and endorse project-related policy and contractual issues&#13;
&#13;
      0   Approve the Project Operational Manual&#13;
&#13;
      0   Approve annual work programs and budgets&#13;
&#13;
      0   Review the implications from project monitoring and impact analyses&#13;
&#13;
      0   Reconcile problems that mightarise during project implementation&#13;
&#13;
      0   Develop consensus among the concerned ministrieson plans and strategies requiredto&#13;
           maximize the development effectiveness o f all ongoing programs in the sector.&#13;
&#13;
2. Budget and Cofinancing&#13;
&#13;
The project design emphasizes the priorities identified in the five-year Master Plan, where the&#13;
horticulture sector alone i s estimated to require US$455 million o f investment funds (33 percent&#13;
 of the total US$1,384 million). These funds would be targeted to the seven most profitable fruit&#13;
 and nut tree crops that have the greatest immediate export potential. Following horticulture and&#13;
wheat production, the Master Plan's third priority i s livestock, with a program investment o f&#13;
US$101 million (7 percent o f the total).    In recognizing the inherent difficulties in increasing&#13;
 livestock productivity, the Plan identifies the high potential for import substitution and export&#13;
 development.&#13;
 Total financing requirement (including c0ntingencies)for the three-year implementation o f HLP i s&#13;
 estimated at around US$49.9 million, with the following allocations:&#13;
 Horticulture development US$23.7 million&#13;
 Livestock developments     US$20.2 million&#13;
 Capacity building (MAI) US$6.0 million&#13;
&#13;
 The total includes an estimated requirement o f US$10 million for technical assistance personnel&#13;
 (facilitating partners) and short-term studies. This level o f expenditure i s justified for the&#13;
 following reasons: (i) i s the first comprehensive development to be implemented by MAI,&#13;
                        HLP&#13;
 where transformation into a modem, demand-driven administration is still at a formative stage;&#13;
 (ii) buildingintheMinistry,bothatheadquartersandinthefield,isacentralpillarofthe&#13;
     capacity&#13;
 Agriculture Master Plan; and (iii) i s the swiftest and most efficient means o f developing a&#13;
                                     this&#13;
 modern ministry of agriculture.      All technical assistance personnel would work with MA1&#13;
 personnel to achieve these objectives. Detailed terms o f reference have been developed for each&#13;
 post and all technical assistance personnel will be recruited by MA1 under performance-based&#13;
 contracts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                27&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Detailed summaries o f these costs are shown in Appendix 4. O f the total financing, the initial&#13;
IDA grant will fundUS$20 million and the total cost estimate for the first project year isUS$13.1&#13;
million. It i s agreed that the Japanese Social Development Fund (JSDF) will provide US$10&#13;
million toward project costs and it i s proposed to request US$18.8 million from the IDA-&#13;
administered Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund (ARTF). The latter was created to finance&#13;
key recurrent expenditures (salaries, capital expenditures, operations, and maintenance o f key&#13;
government institutions) and for urgent investments and reconstruction activities planned in the&#13;
country's economic recovery program. The ARTF can either finance free-standing projects or&#13;
cofinance IDA or other donor-funded projects. Other interested aid agencies, notably DFID and&#13;
CIDA, have expressed interest in supporting HLP either through bilateral arrangements or ARTF.&#13;
The latter includes procedures to permit donors to express preferences for a priority program or&#13;
project included in the government multi-year development budget, and for which the&#13;
government has requestedARTF funding.&#13;
&#13;
There i s strong endorsement o f the project concept from other donors interested in supporting&#13;
rural development in Afghanistan. For example, both the ADB and the EC are initiating or&#13;
preparing proposals to support the horticulture sector. EC will also be providing support for&#13;
veterinary services. It i s likely that USAID will continue to support livestock developments,&#13;
under a new RAMP agreement in mid-2006. All o f these activities are at a formative stage and&#13;
implementation o f H L P will be organized in close collaboration with the EC, USAID and ADB&#13;
activities. It i s anticipated that the new productivity focus will attract additional funds for the&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
3. Procurement Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Guidelines&#13;
&#13;
Procurement for H L P will be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines:&#13;
Procurement under IBRDLoans and IDA Credits" (dated May 2004); "Guidelines: Selection and&#13;
Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" (dated May 2004); and the provisions&#13;
stipulated in the Development Grant Agreement. The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents,&#13;
Requests for Proposals, and Forms o f Consultant Contract will be used. In case o f&#13;
conflicticontradiction between the Bank's procurement procedures and any national rules and&#13;
regulations, the Bank's procurement procedures will take precedence. The expenditure under&#13;
different categories i s expected to be as follows:&#13;
     Goods:       US$20.2 million&#13;
&#13;
     Works:       US$3.2 million&#13;
     Services     US$26.5 million&#13;
     Total        US$49.9 million&#13;
&#13;
Procurement Responsibility&#13;
&#13;
The IMST will be responsible for procurement under the project through MA1 Policy and&#13;
Planning Department and with assistance from the Government's Central Procurement&#13;
Consultant. The procurement procedures and procurement plan reflect the public procurement&#13;
environment o f the country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  28&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Procurement Methods&#13;
&#13;
For each contract to be financed by the proposed grant, the different procurement methods or&#13;
consultant selection methods, the need for prequalification, estimated costs, prior review&#13;
requirements, and timeframe are described in appendix 6 and the Procurement Plan (Appendix 6)&#13;
The Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to reflect the actual project&#13;
implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity. A General Procurement Notice&#13;
will be published in UNDBIDgMarket indicating the major packages to be procured under the&#13;
project.&#13;
&#13;
The ADB is proposing to invest in developments associated with actions proposed under HLP,&#13;
focused on post-harvest horticulture activities and institution building. It i s agreed in principle&#13;
that when the detailed proposals for the ADB developments are decided, joint procurement&#13;
arrangements could be formulated.      To simplify procurement procedures, the possibility for&#13;
adopting similar procurement or cofinancing arrangements for HLP will be investigated with&#13;
other interested aid agencies (EC, DFID, CIDA, and JICA).&#13;
&#13;
4. Financial Management, Disbursementand Audit Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
A PFM performance rating system has been recently developed for Afghanistan by the Public&#13;
Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) multi-agency partnership program, which&#13;
includes the World Bank, IMF, EC, and other agencies. Afghanistan's ratings against the PFM&#13;
performance indicators portray a public sector where financial resources are, by and large, being&#13;
used for their intended purposes as authorized by a budget that i s processedwith transparency and&#13;
has contributedto aggregate fiscal discipline.&#13;
&#13;
Financial management and audit functions for HLP will be undertaken through the agents&#13;
contracted under the Public Administration Capacity Building project. This i s the primary&#13;
instrument for continuing to strengthen the fiduciary measures put in place for ensuring&#13;
transparency and accountability o f funds provided by the Bank and other donors. Under these&#13;
contracts, two advisers-Financial   Management and Audit-are       responsible for working with the&#13;
government and line ministries to carry out these core functions. The Financial Management&#13;
Agent (FMA) i s responsible for helping the MOF maintain the accounts for all public&#13;
expenditures, including IDA-financed projects and for building capacity within the government&#13;
offices for these functions. Quarterly Financial Monitoring Reports will be prepared by M A Y S&#13;
accounting unit. Consolidated project reports will be prepared, reviewed, and approved by the&#13;
MOF, supported by the FMA.&#13;
&#13;
A Designated Account (DA), with an initial deposit of U S 1 0 million, will be opened at Da&#13;
Afghanistan Bank (DAB, Central Bank) or in a local commercial bank in the name o f the project&#13;
on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. The DA will be maintained by the MOF.&#13;
Withdrawal applications for replenishment will be submitted monthly.             Specialist financial&#13;
management and procurement technical assistance will be contracted as part o f IMST to work&#13;
with PPD personnel to strengthen existing capacity. Financialmanagement arrangements for HLP&#13;
are detailed in appendix 7.&#13;
&#13;
FundsFlow&#13;
&#13;
Management o f funds for HLP will follow existing procedures. As with all public expenditure, all&#13;
payments under the project will be routed through MOF. The FM Agent will assist the M O F in&#13;
executing and recording project payments. Inkeeping with current practices for other projects in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  29&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Afghanistan, the DA will be operated by the Special Disbursement Unit (SDU) in the Treasury&#13;
Department MOF. Requests for payments from DA funds will be made to the SDU by the&#13;
relevant implementing entities.     In addition to payments from DA funds, the implementing&#13;
entities can also request the SDU to make direct payments to consultants or consulting firms, and&#13;
special commitments for contracts covered by letters o f credit. Such requests will follow World&#13;
Bank procedures. All withdrawal applications to IDA, including replenishment, reimbursement,&#13;
and direct payment applications, will be prepared and submitted by MOF.&#13;
&#13;
Accounting and Reporting&#13;
&#13;
Financial management specialists5 (FMS) o f the Implementation Management Support Team o f&#13;
the Policy and Planning Department will supervise preparation o f supporting documents for&#13;
expenditures, payment orders (Form M16), approval, and submission o f the same to the Treasury&#13;
Department MOF. The Department, in turn, will issue a check payable to the cash trustee by&#13;
DABafter verification o f supporting documents and approvals on the form.&#13;
&#13;
The FMS will develop a FinancialManagement Manual outlining guidelines for project activities,&#13;
and establish a project financial management system in accordance with standard Afghan&#13;
government policies and procedures. This will include use o f the Chart o f Accounts developed&#13;
by the FMA to record project expenditures. Project accounts will be consolidated centrally in&#13;
MOF, through the SDU and supported by the FMA. Consolidated Project Financial Statements&#13;
will be prepared for all sources and uses o fproject expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
DisbursementMethod&#13;
&#13;
Disbursements from the IDA grant will be transaction-based, with replenishment, reimbursement,&#13;
direct payment, and payments under Special Commitments including full documentation or&#13;
against statements o f expenditures, as appropriate.&#13;
&#13;
Retroactive Financing&#13;
&#13;
Provision has been made to reimburse the Government o f Afghanistan (GOA) for payments it&#13;
makes for project expenditures, up to US$0.5 million, between April 5, 2006 and the time o f&#13;
grant signing.&#13;
&#13;
Audit ofProiect Funds&#13;
&#13;
The Auditor General, supported by the Audit Agent, i s responsible for auditing the accounts o f all&#13;
IDA-financed projects. Annual audited project financial statements will be submitted within six&#13;
months o f the close o f GOA'S fiscal year.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
E. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMICJUSTIFICATION&#13;
&#13;
 1.ProjectBenefits&#13;
&#13;
Preliminary analyses have been made o f the likely project impact (Appendix 5). These are based&#13;
 on representative farm models for beneficiaries o f each subcomponent. At project maturity (PY 5&#13;
&#13;
  Before effectiveness MA1will nominatehecruit a civil servant or consultant to act as the counterpart for&#13;
the FMSprovided by the lead Facilitating Partner (FP). Both counterpart and lead FP financial&#13;
management specialists will be on the ImplementationManagement Support Team.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                          30&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
to 7), the incremental annual output from horticulture i s estimated to reach about 32,000 tons for&#13;
both grapes and pomegranates, and 4,000 tons for almonds. Incremental milk production for&#13;
sale/processing i s expected to reach 16,000 tons/year and incremental poultry production will&#13;
reach to 100 million o f eggs and 1,754 tons o f meat at project maturity (PY5). Animal health&#13;
activities under HLP would have a significant additional impact on increased production;&#13;
however, no effort has beenmade to project these values.&#13;
&#13;
The financial analyses indicate that, at project maturity, income for participating farmers' will&#13;
increase by between 6 and 140 percent over the without project situation. For horticulture,&#13;
incremental income ranges between 6 and 13 percent for rehabilitated orchards, between 115 and&#13;
140 percent for new grape production, between 12 and 17 percent for new almond groves, and&#13;
between 15 and 20 percent for pomegranates.           Incremental income for poultry and dairy&#13;
production would be 20 and 16 percent, respectively.&#13;
&#13;
The economic impact i s measured for the project as a whole and for individual components by&#13;
subtracting project costs from the estimated benefits. This includes the cost o f grants, extension&#13;
and other services and the capacity buildingand administration costs. The cost o f incentives and&#13;
services for beneficiary farmers that fail to complete the proposed changes (assumed at 15&#13;
percent) are also taken into account. Most tradable input and product economic prices are&#13;
assumed to be equivalent to their market prices (except for labor where a shadow price o f 0.7 has&#13;
been applied to reflect the highunderemployment inrural Afghanistan). All prices are assumed to&#13;
remain constant inreal terms throughout the life o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
On this basis, the economic rate o f return (ERR) on total project investments over 20 years i s&#13;
estimated at 40.2 percent and, assuming a 12 percent discount rate for the expected costs and&#13;
benefits, the net present value would reach US$104.7 million. Excluding the costs o f the capacity&#13;
building component, the ERRS of the production components would be 32.7 percent for&#13;
horticulture, 49.9 percent for dairy, and 81 percent for the poultry subcomponents.&#13;
&#13;
The investment in institution buildingwill have lasting impact by helping to develop both MAI's&#13;
planning capacity and organize modem technical support systems for horticulture and livestock&#13;
production. In addition, by supporting the creation o f HDCA, the project will help develop an&#13;
effective means for promoting horticultural production and marketing for all stakeholders. The&#13;
animal health component will help formalize the creation o f a sustainable independent national&#13;
veterinary service.&#13;
&#13;
The project seems to be strong enough to support the adverse independent occurrence o f the&#13;
major risks identified,   including delays in implementation, cost escalation, and lower than&#13;
expected impact (see appendix 5). As a result of the sensitivity analysis it was estimated that the&#13;
expected ERR of the project i s 24 percent, and that the probability o f obtaining a higher ERR than&#13;
24 percent would be 0.60.&#13;
&#13;
2. Project Risks&#13;
&#13;
The project design incorporates the lessons learned from ongoing IDA-supported projects in&#13;
Afghanistan, particularly with regard to project implementation, procurement arrangements, and&#13;
financial management arrangements. At the same time, the design o f the components reflects&#13;
experiences from similar technical developments supported by other aid agencies. Nonetheless,&#13;
there are risks because o f the uncertain socioeconomic and administrative situation in&#13;
Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 31&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                      Mitigation Measures&#13;
                           Drawing from experience with other projects, the implementation&#13;
deteriorates inrural areas arrangements will rely on well-qualified FPs already working in&#13;
                           Afghanistan. Ifa deteriorating security situation prevents planned&#13;
                           merations. these mav be transferred to other districts inthe Drovince.&#13;
Possible resistance by     Project document and implementation plan prioritize actions to strengthen&#13;
government to Facilitatinl MA1personnel. By directly linkingwith qualifiedpersonnel inMA1&#13;
+&#13;
Partners                   technical departments and the provinces concerned, the FPs will help&#13;
                           accelerate and institutionalize humanresource development.&#13;
Political interference in  tnstitutional design o f the HDCA and strong private sector participation in&#13;
day-to-day operations o f  the management o f the Council.&#13;
&#13;
Delays in effecting        Continue to work incollaboration with PRR and with a coordinated donor&#13;
reorganization o f         group.&#13;
MA1departments&#13;
Weak capacity of           HLP will be the first significant project inMAI. Project funds will&#13;
MA1technical and financ provide for strengthening the MA1PlanningDepartment andhiring&#13;
departments                skilled personnel to form an Implementation Management Support Team.&#13;
Possible confusion with    Close collaboration with associated aid agencies throughout project&#13;
other aid agencies having preparation: (i) ADB is proposingto invest inhorticulture, with a focus&#13;
similar projects           on post-harvest developments; and (ii)    horticulture and livestock activities&#13;
                           proposed under EC financing are complementary and close collaboration&#13;
                           will prevent duplication. ADB is amenable tojoint procurement.&#13;
                           Similarly, no confusion i s likely with livestock developments by USAID.&#13;
                           Avian flu was diagnosed inAfghanistan inMarch2006. As poultry&#13;
                           financed under HLP would be housed, risks o f contaminationby wild&#13;
                           birds,and direct contact with humans would be minimal. The Bank, in&#13;
                           collaborationwith FAO, i s now appraising a project for countering the&#13;
                           effects o f avian flu. Actions for developingthe sanitary mandate under&#13;
                           HLP would be directly relevant for this.&#13;
                           Production components are designed to demonstrate approaches for&#13;
developments affected by increasing productivity o f horticulture and livestock and are based on&#13;
lack o f credit            partial grants. Where necessary, CDCs or other community authorities&#13;
                           will liaise with MISFA and other microfinance organizations to help&#13;
                           accelerate uptake.&#13;
Lack o f coordination      The same Steering Committee coordinatingmost o f these IDA-financed&#13;
between complementary      projects will be playing an important role inapproving annual plans and&#13;
program (NSP, NEEP,        approving the operational manuals.&#13;
MISFA, EIW) could&#13;
prevent the HLP from&#13;
realizing its potential&#13;
The in-cash                For new orchards, a sliding scale contribution or similar mechanism&#13;
contributions of           proportional to the area cultivated will guarantee the highest subsidies to&#13;
beneficiaries to           smaller farmers. Beneficiaries will contribute to the cost o f poultry&#13;
investments could          packages. Ifrequired, field FPs will mobilize microcredit facilities to&#13;
exclude poor farmers       assist beneficiaries, in collaborationwith CDCs or other community&#13;
                           authorities.&#13;
                           The government, with support from donor agencies, i s implementingan&#13;
business thrives ina       anti-narcotic strategy and alternative livelihood action plan. The strategy&#13;
                           may include using priority subprograms such as NSP as part o f a package&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
 Implementation inHigh-riskAreas&#13;
&#13;
 The extent to which the project will be able to assist farmers throughout the country i s critically&#13;
 dependent on the security situation. Security remains problematic in some provinces because o f&#13;
 the limited extent o f government authority. Aid agencies can face threats from crime, inter-&#13;
 warlord rivalries, and opponents to the government (primarily from Taliban and the Hizb-e-&#13;
 Islami). The security situation in the country i s expected to ease in the coming years, but risks&#13;
 remain, particularly inthe South. Preliminary operations o f H L P have therefore been designed to&#13;
 avoid areas o f persistent risk.&#13;
&#13;
 3. Alternatives Considered&#13;
&#13;
 Approach and Scale&#13;
&#13;
 The project i s the first extensive effort since the 1970s to directly expand and modernize&#13;
 agricultural production in Afghanistan.        Two alternatives were considered in preparing the&#13;
 project: (i)concentrating on increasing production o f field crops; and (ii)designing more&#13;
 ambitious subcomponents.        The first option was rejected because the Emergency Irrigation&#13;
 Rehabilitation Project (EIRP) i s focused on increasing output o f staple crops. Moreover, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     33&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
horticulture and livestock subsectors offer the greatest scope for promoting economic&#13;
development, raising levels o f rural incomes, stimulating exports, and countering poppy&#13;
production, as stated in the Agriculture Master Plan. The second option was rejected because in&#13;
the view o f the project team, an emergency project focusing on profitable approaches for small-&#13;
scale operators will provide an effective demonstration and foster demand that can be addressed&#13;
through an expanding program. This was deemed the best use o f limited grant funding. In&#13;
addition, development on a larger scale would be possible only in the context o f viable rural&#13;
credit operations. These do not exist.&#13;
&#13;
Use o f Credit Schemes&#13;
&#13;
Limited access to financial capital is a major constraint to investingin agriculture in Afghanistan.&#13;
After careful analysis, the possibility o f establishing credit facilities was dropped in favor o f&#13;
simple grants schemes. While establishing credit schemes might improve sustainability, the&#13;
design o f such schemes would require a long period o f gradual institutional building and&#13;
specialized expertise that i s beyond the scope o fthe project.&#13;
&#13;
A Component Addressing Pastoral Nomads&#13;
&#13;
During preparation, a component directed at pastoral nomads was considered. However, the&#13;
complexity o f the social implications, the holistic and integrated approach that such intervention&#13;
would warrant and the cross-institutional responsibilities that its implementation would entail&#13;
suggested that a stand-alone operation should be considered for tackling this major challenge.&#13;
&#13;
ImplementationArrangements&#13;
&#13;
This is the first large-scale development project to be undertaken by MAI. Direct implementation&#13;
o f the project by the Ministry staff was rejected on the evidence from NSP, where the positive&#13;
experience with the Ministry of Rural Reconstruction and Development demonstrates the&#13;
importance o f distinguishing the core function o f the Ministry from program delivery.&#13;
Implementation will therefore be assigned to Facilitating Partners with temporary functions,&#13;
including responsibility for building institutional capacity within MAL For the same reasons, the&#13;
possibility o f establishing a Project Implementation Unit was discounted in favor of an&#13;
Implementation Support Management Team as an integral part o f the MA1 structure, working&#13;
alongside Ministry staff.&#13;
&#13;
4. Project Sustainability&#13;
&#13;
The project design includes features that are critical for ensuring sustainability o f the investments.&#13;
The project will support capacity building that will enable MA1to play an effective role inpolicy,&#13;
planning, and regulatory functions o f the sector as well as providing necessary support to help&#13;
farmers resolve technical problems and develop modern production systems. Project actions will&#13;
be instrumental in establishing such a framework, as well as for demonstrating procedures for&#13;
developing modern production systems that can be expanded into a program to address the&#13;
priorities o f the Agriculture Master Plan and to attract funding from other aid agencies. As a&#13;
sustainability measure, the basis for the organizing both horticulture and livestock operations will&#13;
be orientedto private sector initiatives, including:&#13;

&#13;
     0    Fostering voluntary farmers associations for producing and marketing horticulture and&#13;
          animal products.&#13;
In addition, the project will use CDCs and traditional shuras through a consultative and&#13;
participatory mechanism to plan, implement, and monitor project activities. The involvement o f&#13;
community in the project and the sliding scale contribution mechanism will enhance the prospects&#13;
o f sustainability o f the project investments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
F. ENVIRONMENTALAND SOCIAL SAFEGUARDS&#13;
&#13;
1.EnvironmentalandSocialImpactsandSafeguards&#13;
&#13;
The Environment and Social Safeguards Framework (appendix 8) will be followed through the&#13;
project's arrangements for implementation, monitoring, and capacity building. In terms o f social&#13;
impacts, the project falls in the B category o f the Framework's Guidelines for Land and Asset&#13;
Acquisition, Entitlements, and Compensation. It has an environmental rating o f B.&#13;
&#13;
Environmental Impacts&#13;
&#13;
Project activities are not expected to have any significant negative environmental or social impacts.&#13;
On the contrary, developments proposed for perennial tree crops are likely to have a positive impact&#13;
by promoting nursery development that will lead to an increase in orchard areas. The promotion of&#13;
perennial horticulture might increase the use o f chemical insecticides and fertilizers in the project&#13;
areas and possibly trigger OP/BP 4.09. However, the strict IPMmeasure to be installed under the&#13;
project, including hiring IPM specialists, developing crop-specific IPM plans, training farmers in&#13;
the application o f IPM planning, and monitoring the I P M activities in project areas, will mitigate&#13;
this risk. Risko f erosion innew orchard areas will be mitigatedby seeding alfalfa cover crop at the&#13;
same time that fruit tree seedlings are planted.&#13;
&#13;
Land Acquisition&#13;
&#13;
No land acquisition i s anticipated under the project. In the current socio-political context in the&#13;
rural areas, involuntary land acquisition based on the State's eminent domain i s unlikely for the&#13;
kind of small-scale activities that will be undertaken under the project, for two reasons. If any&#13;
minor areas o f land would be needed for a project (for example, for construction o f veterinary&#13;
offices), such land could be obtained only through private voluntary donations, compensation paid&#13;
by the community (that is, transactions between willing buyers and willing sellers)--or, more&#13;
likely, from available government land.        Private voluntary donations and community purchases&#13;
would be documented as required by the Framework. For government land, documentation would&#13;
be needed that the land i s free o f encroachments, squatters, or other constraints, and has been&#13;
transferred to the project by the authorities.&#13;
&#13;
Ethnic Minority Groups&#13;
&#13;
The design for the project reflects a strategy that will ensure that ethnic minority groups are&#13;
included as beneficiaries, and that their concerns are addressed in compliance with the requirements&#13;
o f OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples. There are three key elements o f this strategy: (i)    horticulture&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 35&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
and intensive livestock production activities will be open to all farmers in the project area; (ii)&#13;
                                                                                                  the&#13;
pilot activities with pastoralists are specifically designed to demonstrate approaches and legislative&#13;
changes that would benefit kuchi and sedentary communities living in the same areas; and (iii)&#13;
independent monitoring by civil society (NGOs and the press) will provide another mechanism to&#13;
identify cases where ethnic minority groups would have been bypassed or marginalized by project&#13;
operations.&#13;
&#13;
Cultural Propertv&#13;
&#13;
Chance finds    during implementation of subprojects involving civil works will be reported to the&#13;
provincial or district governors, who then will inform the Archaeological Committee, Compliance&#13;
with the safeguard provisions and the negative list will be ensured through an environmental, social,&#13;
and mine risk screening procedure (checklists) requiredfor grants eligibility, and by internal input,&#13;
process, and output monitoring, independent external monitoring by consultants, and by Bank&#13;
supervision missions.&#13;
&#13;
Consultation and Disclosure&#13;
&#13;
The Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework will be disclosed by the government through&#13;
inDari and Pashto, as well as Englishthrough apublication andthe government's Web site. It will&#13;
also be made available at the World Bank's Infoshop. The following information on the project&#13;
will be posted on the government's Web site:            summaries o f quarterly HLP implementation&#13;
progress reports, summaries o f annual project financial statements and audit reports, and summaries&#13;
o f findings from monitoring and supervision teams (after a reasonable period allowed for internal&#13;
review).&#13;
&#13;
2. Land Mine Risk Management&#13;
&#13;
No project activities will be implementedwithout appropriate mine risk management, based on the&#13;
procedures defined inthe Environmental and Social Safeguard Framework (appendix 8).&#13;

specifying responsibilities and expected output targets and that they are trained effectively to carry&#13;
out their expected tasks.&#13;
&#13;
A Business Development Division (BDD) will be created within the HDCA to help inensuring the&#13;

post-harvest and marketingtechnologies and stimulate further local initiatives inhorticulture.&#13;
&#13;
The Council will also develop a number o f specific grower, trader and horticultural processor and&#13;
government support activities, including organizing meetings, training and study tours, providing&#13;
links for technical advice and information, market research, trade missions and exhibitions. Some&#13;

        Prepare an administrative system for the effective operation o f the Council&#13;
        Present the Council administration manual to all members o f the Council Board and&#13;
         ensuring that all members are able to understandand interpret its contents&#13;
        Help establish task forces/commodity groups (as required) to deal with specific products&#13;
         or defined policy issues (such as customs regulations, regional trade issues, export&#13;
         licences, and certification)&#13;
         Assist indeterminingbudgets and preparing plans for developing Council activities&#13;
         Help in ensuring that members are kept informed o f all Council decisions and actions&#13;
         and remain committed to the development of the Council at bothnational and local level&#13;
&#13;
The FP will need to provide support to the founding Board, President, and CEO in relation to&#13;
organising and conducting the first Annual General Meeting and formal elections to the Council,&#13;
which are due within six months after formation o f the Council (according to the Articles o f&#13;

    0    Working closely with Board, Government and IDA personnel to ensure that proper&#13;
         administrative procedures are followed and documented&#13;
&#13;
StrengtheningGrower and Market Support Activities&#13;
&#13;
The HDCA also aims to help strengthen Afghan capacity to provide appropriate support services&#13;
for horticultural growers, traders and processors. The FP will help the Council to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0    Prepare a detailed database o f current service providers (individual and Institutional,&#13;
         public and private) and their capabilities for providing specific extension services to&#13;
         horticultural growers&#13;
    e    Conduct detailed surveys o f key training needs and prepare detailed training plans for&#13;
         public and private extension service providers and for clearly defined technical issues,&#13;
         specific target groups and regions&#13;
    0    Train, inform and advise both public and private extension service providers in&#13;
         appropriate production, post-harvest and marketing practices     - including the preparation&#13;
         o f farm business, trader and processor plans and credit/grant applications  - based on the&#13;
         results o f a detailed training needs survey&#13;
    e     Strengthen linkages between the H D C A and vocational training providers in horticulture&#13;
         to improve the quality o f training and material provision on existing courses, or to&#13;
         introduce new courses that could eventually will lead to a certification program for&#13;
         horticultural growers, with a particular emphasis on younger growers and women&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  47&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
     0   Plan, organize and coordinate demonstrations and study visits for horticultural growers,&#13;
         traders and processors, based on the assessment o f key training needs&#13;
     0   Conduct marketing research and analyze specific markets, with particular attention given&#13;
         to export market opportunities and focused research into defined markets (such as India&#13;
         or the Middle East) and products (such as dried raisins)&#13;
     0   Plan, organize and support trade missions and facilitate the attendance o f horticulture&#13;
         grower association representatives and market operators at regional and international&#13;
         food, agriculture and other relevant trade exhibitions, conferences, and workshops&#13;
     0   Prepare, collect and disseminate relevant information on technologies, suppliers, markets&#13;
         and buyers relevant to horticulture&#13;
     0   Develop appropriate dissemination messages for growers, traders, processors, and&#13;
         government on how to improve production, post harvest practices and marketing&#13;
         Encourage and strengthen linkages between horticultural input suppliers, traders,&#13;
         processors and other buyers and so further encourage import substitution and increased&#13;
         exports o f horticultural products&#13;
     0   Encourage further certification, quality improvements, standardization and added value&#13;
         activity inhorticultural production&#13;
&#13;
It i s not intended that the Council, at least during its formative years, develop a full time&#13;
extension staff; rather, the Council may issue service provider contracts for specifically defined&#13;
activities to trained and qualified individuals and organizations. However where suitable or&#13;
sufficient local technical skills do not presently exist, the H D C A will help to train specialists as&#13;
necessary and with the financial support o f the HLP. Where specialist skills are already available,&#13;
local service providers will be contracted to help to strengthen local capacities, but where there i s&#13;
no current capacity, international specialists will be contracted through the FP to train and/or&#13;
mentor local specialists/coordinators.&#13;
&#13;
Each year the FP, alongside the CEO, will present a work plan for each activity and based on&#13;
widespread consultation with H D C A members and association agencies and review o f relevant&#13;
data. This activity plan will present targets, numbers and outcomes. Each year the CEO will&#13;
present the plan to the Board of the Council for final approval. Budgets will be available through&#13;
the HLP to support each o f the activities defined above. However, the FP will also be expected to&#13;
develop joint funding programs with other donors, private sector, and trade associations and&#13;
particularly inrelation to demonstrations, trade missions, promotions and exhibitions.&#13;
&#13;
BusinessDevelopment&#13;
&#13;
To help ensure the sustainability o f the activities o f the Council, a Business Development&#13;
Division will deal with membership recruitment issues, new activity planning, and financing to&#13;
broaden or maintain its base of activities, income, and membership. The responsibilities o f this&#13;
division will be to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      0  Help strengthen the membership base and maintain details o f current members, including&#13;
         key government representatives, farmers associations and traders/processor organizations&#13;
      0  Develop a financial record keeping, budgeting and reporting system for the H D C A&#13;

              EMERGENCY HORTICULTURE AND LIVESTOCK PROJECT&#13;
                                      TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Background&#13;
&#13;
The Government o f Afghanistan (GOA) proposed that the Horticulture and Livestock Project&#13;
(HLP) would have an investment cost o f US49.9 million and would be implemented between&#13;
2006 and 2009. Expected project targets include: (i)  creating 5,000 hectares o f new orchards; (ii)&#13;
rehabilitating 12,000 hectares o f old orchards; (iii)&#13;
                                                     helping dairy producers, organized in village&#13;
associations and district and provincial level cooperatives, purchase concentrate feed and other&#13;
inputs, and supply milk to a processing plant to be established under the project; and (iv)&#13;
expanding and improving poultry production      - coordinated through farmers groups - through&#13;
modem, small-scale, semi-intensive enterprises, runespecially by women farmers.&#13;
&#13;
Small-scale farmers are expected to be the main beneficiaries o f the project's production&#13;
components, and as women farmers play a dominant role in orchard management and small-scale&#13;
intensive livestock production, they will benefit at least as much as men. While the proposed&#13;
modem production innovations have not yet been adopted in Afghanistan, there i s extensive&#13;
experience in neighboring countries such as Iran and Pakistan, under similar ago-ecological&#13;
conditions as those prevailing inthe proposed project areas.&#13;
&#13;
Methodology&#13;
&#13;
The financial analysis aims to determine the current attractiveness for the target group to engage&#13;
inthe proposed farm investments and/or improvements. The economic analysis is aimed at testing&#13;
the viability o f the project from the country's economy as a whole, including the costs o f the&#13;
required incentives.&#13;
&#13;
Using FARMOD software, cost and benefits were estimated under two scenarios: (i) without   the&#13;
HLP situation, which corresponds to the maintenance o f the existing smallholders production&#13;
systems; and (ii)the with HLP situation, in which the project components would allow for the&#13;
rehabilitation and expansion o f orchard activities, and the improvement o f the existing livestock&#13;
activities (milk and poultry).&#13;
&#13;
FinancialAnalysis&#13;
&#13;
Detailed financial analyses were undertaken on representative beneficiaries' farms from the&#13;
Central and Northern Regions. Crop budgets were considered on the basis o f the cultivation o f&#13;
one hectare for the following field and fruit crops: wheat, barley, alfalfa, poppy, grapes, almond,&#13;
and pomegranate. Budgets for milk and poultry production activities are regarded separately from&#13;
crops, although these products are sometimes part o f comprehensive mixed farming systems in&#13;
the project areas. There are no price distortions in the project commodities, and actual farm-gate&#13;
prices were used in calculating production costs. In general, the availability o f labor is not a major&#13;
constraint to agncultural development in the project area, except in limited peak demand periods&#13;
duringharvesting o f poppy in certain areas. The availability o f family labor largely meets the field&#13;
requirement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    71&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Crop Budgets&#13;
&#13;
Due to time and security constraints, the appraisal mission could not prepare detailed crop&#13;
budgets in all project areas. However, it could prepare crop budget analysis for existing&#13;
production systems based on field observations in 2003 and 2004 under another World Bank&#13;
project (National Solidarity Project).&#13;
&#13;
The proposed new fruit orchards were modeled on modem production practices which do not&#13;
exist in Afghanistan, and data were therefore based on detailed interviews with farmers in eleven&#13;
similar production areas in Iran. The horticulture component includes provision for implementing&#13;
the extension work. Farm-gate prices are conservative and on average 10-15 percent lower than&#13;
current prices inAfghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
FarmModels&#13;
&#13;
The most recent estimate o f land distribution i s the FA0 survey o f 5,000 farms over 30 provinces&#13;
conducted in 2003. Farm size by agro-ecological zone for the project areas i s summarized in&#13;
tables 1 and 2.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
Two basic farm models have been developed for each o f the two first regions of intervention&#13;
(Central and Northern) as representative o f typical target beneficiary farmers.&#13;
&#13;
Central Region&#13;
&#13;
Typical farmers would be introducing minor changes intheir production systems, including 1 or 2&#13;
jeribs (0.2 or 0.4 hectares) of new orchard, rehabilitating old trees, and developing new or&#13;
intensifying their existing milk or poultry production activities. Farmers' land i s usually divided&#13;
in intensively irrigated land that is cultivated every year, and intermittently irrigated land that is&#13;
cultivated occasionally.&#13;
&#13;
The small farm model (Model A) i s based on 2 hectares cultivated intermittently every other&#13;
year due to limited water availability, and 1 hectare cultivated every year. Inthis model farmers&#13;
cultivate therefore an average of 2 hectares o f land every year. They include: 1.2 ha o f wheat, 0.4&#13;
ha o f grapes, 0.2 ha with alfalfa and 0.2 with other crops.&#13;
&#13;
The larger farm model (Model B) represents families cultivating an average 5 hectares, out o f&#13;
which: 3 hectares are on a three-year rotation due to limited water availability, while 2 hectares&#13;
are intensively cultivated every year. Hence, every year these farmers would cultivate a total o f 3&#13;
hectares o f land, including: 2.2 hectare with wheat and 0.6 hectares with alfalfa, vegetables,&#13;
beans, corn and other minor crops. These farmers typically have 0.2 ha o f grapes and, inthe with-&#13;
project scenario, will either incorporate 0.4 ha o f new vineyard (intercropped with alfalfa) and&#13;
reduce wheat cultivation, or improve their dairy or poultry production activities through the&#13;
project's livestock component.&#13;
&#13;
Northern Region&#13;
&#13;
 The small farm model (Model C) for the Northern Region represents a household with an&#13;
 average 5.8 hectares o f land, o f which: 4.8 hectares are on a five year rotation (due to limited&#13;
 water availability) and 1 hectare i s intensively cultivated every year. Every year, these farmers&#13;
 would cultivate 1.8 hectares o f land, including: 1 hectare o f wheat, 0.2 hectares o f barley, 0.2&#13;
 hectares o f poppy and 0.2 hectares with alfalfa, vegetables and other minor crops. Through the&#13;
 horticulture component participating farmers would incorporate 0.2 hectares o f new almond trees&#13;
 (intercropped with alfalfa) and reduce wheat and some poppy cultivation once almond orchards&#13;
 start producing. As in the Central Region model adopting the livestock component, beneficiaries&#13;
 would only improve the milk or poultry production.&#13;
&#13;
 The larger farm model (Model D) represents families who farm an average o f 10 hectares o f&#13;
 land, o f which 8 hectares are on a five year rotation system (due to limited water availability) and&#13;
 2 hectares are intensively cultivated every year. These farmers cultivate about 3.6 hectares&#13;
 annually, including: 2.2 hectares o f wheat, 0.4 hectares o f barley, 0.4 hectares o f poppy and 0.2&#13;
 hectares o f alfalfa, vegetables and other minor crops. They also cultivate 0.2 hectares o f almond&#13;
 and, with the project, would incorporate 0.4 hectares of new almond orchards (intercropped with&#13;
 alfalfa) and reduce wheat and possibly some poppy cultivation once orchards start producing.&#13;
 Under this model livestock production would be restrictedto improving existing activities,&#13;
&#13;
 The anticipated incrementalyields resulting from project activities havebeen phased over three to&#13;
 four cropping years. The anticipated yields and income per ha are summarized inthe Table 3.&#13;

DairyProductionImprovements.&#13;
&#13;
Provision o f inputs, technical services, and milk collection in about 300 villages (50 collection&#13;
centers) and for 20,000 farm families i s expected to lead to better nutrition, genetic upgrading,&#13;
and improved hygiene and health for cattle. A typical family cow currently produces 800 liters&#13;
per lactation and has a calving rate of 75 percent, equivalent to average milk production o f 500&#13;
ltlyear. The with-project situation would improve yields to 7001t per year in Year 2 and lOOOlt in&#13;
Year 3 as a result o f improved feeding and hygiene. Increasing milk's yield to 1,500 literslyear in&#13;
Year 10 i s possible as a result o f using cross-bred animals; however, this has not been assumed in&#13;
the project benefits. The with-project situation i s also expected to produce a 10 percent increase&#13;
innumbers of animals in Year 2 and 25 percent in Year 3 for farmers starting in PY1, and an&#13;
increase o f participating farmers o f 10 percent inYear 2 and 30 percent inYear 3.&#13;
&#13;
Some 25 percent o f milk production i s assumed to be consumed on farm. With the dairy&#13;
processing unit to be established under the project involving milk collection centers, district milk&#13;
producers associations and provincial unions along the lines o f the successful Amul system in&#13;
India, expected farm-gate prices for milk would increase from US$O.lO to US$0.26/lt (a 260&#13;
percent increase). The expected increased milkproduction as result o f the dairy sub-component .is&#13;
shown intable 4 below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  Price o f poppy varied from US$50 to US8350 per kilo. For the budget presentedinthis assessment, a&#13;
price o f US$150 was used. By focusing on high value horticulture and livestock products as grapes and&#13;
emphasizing small-scale farmers, the Horticulture and Livestock Project (HLP) will make a positive&#13;
contribution to the Government's counter-narcotics strategy.&#13;

PoultryProductionImprovements&#13;
&#13;
The project would distribute 120,000 six-to-eight week-old pullets (104,000 hens and 16,000&#13;
males, 15 birds per family unit) to 8,000 small farmers in each o f the three project&#13;
implementation years. These units would be housed and managed more intensively than the&#13;
traditional backyard poultry (typically 6 per family). Egg production would start at the sixth&#13;
month and the cycle would continue for about 18 months, with output from the semi-intensive&#13;
hens peaking at 180 eggs per heniyear. In addition, mortality would be reduced because o f project&#13;
vaccinations, thus production from traditional birds would produce an additional 50 eggdyear.&#13;
Slaughtering and replacement o f hems i s assumed at 24 months o f age (90 percent o f birds&#13;
surviving), with culled birds being sold or consumed on farm. The expected incremental&#13;
production o f the 24,000 families to be reached by this subcomponent would have an aggregate&#13;
value o f more thanUS$5 million equivalent per year.&#13;
&#13;
On-farmFinancialResults&#13;
&#13;
The estimated incremental impact from HLP on individual farmers compares the detailed&#13;
financial analysis o f the existing farm budgets and the expected values o f increased productivity&#13;
obtained from project interventions. Considering the four basic farm models (A and B for the&#13;
Central Region and C and D for the Northern Region), the estimates o f incremental farm income&#13;
(before family labor) are based on farms that: (i)establish new orchards; or (ii)rehabilitate&#13;
existing orchards; or (iii)improve dairy production; or (iv) provide 16 pullets for increasing&#13;
poultry production (eggs and meat). Farm models take into account agricultural and possible off-&#13;
farm income, on-farm consumption o f eggs and meat, on-farm use o f manure, fodder crops, and&#13;
the hiringo f labor to meet seasonal peaks for family labor.&#13;
&#13;
Off-FarmProjectSupport Activities.&#13;
&#13;
Under the project support to the dairy development initiative, a dairy processing and feed mixing&#13;
units, and about thirty milk collection centers with refrigeratedtanks to be managed by farmers'&#13;
associations will allow for the processing and marketing o f dairy products, adding value and&#13;
improving results to the activity.&#13;
&#13;
Farmers' FamilyIncome.&#13;
&#13;
Beneficiaries' income would increase at project maturity between 6 percent and 140 percent over&#13;
the present situation. The extent o f increased income depends on the type and size o f farm, on the&#13;
relative importance o f the improved activity on the production system, and on the crop/activity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 75&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
type involved. New grape vines would generate between 115 percent and 140percent incremental&#13;
family income, almonds groves between 12 percent and 17 percent; and pomegranates between&#13;
15 percent and 20 percent. Rehabilitationo f existing grape and almond old groves would produce&#13;
increased household income o f 13 percent and 6 percent respectively. Incremental livestock&#13;
production would be 16 percent to 24 percent in the case o f poultry and dairy production&#13;
respectively.&#13;
&#13;
The proposed interventions should be attractive to the beneficiaries o f both project areas, as table&#13;
4 below indicates. Indeed, some farmers could obtain even higher results. For purposes of this&#13;
analysis, calculations were considered independently for each project sub-component, as if&#13;
farmers could only benefit from either rehabilitation o f old orchards, or installation o f new ones,&#13;
or improvement o f dairy production, or o f poultry expansion. Inreality, some farmers could well&#13;
incorporate two or more of the production systems supported by HLP, thus their results could be&#13;
even higher.&#13;

&#13;
 However, given the level o f poverty in rural Afghanistan and the average size o f families (nine&#13;
 members), the expected increase in family income, while significant, would not be sufficient to&#13;
pull farmers out of poverty. Only households represented by Models B, by increasing grapes&#13;
 orchards by about 0.4 hectares, would reach a family income of about US$2 per capita per day,&#13;
 the acceptedpoverty threshold.&#13;

  EconomicAnalysis&#13;
&#13;
The aggregation o f farm budgets provide the basis for the estimation o f the economic benefits o f&#13;
the HLP: this aggregation includes incremental physical quantities and economic values o f inputs&#13;
used and production at the farm level for the about 40,000 beneficiaries o f the horticultural&#13;
component and a similar amount o f the livestock component. The aggregate result shows whether&#13;
the project would be desirable for the economy. Most tradable input and product economic prices&#13;
were assumed to be equivalent to their market prices (a shadow price o f 0.7 was applied for labor&#13;
costs given the high underemployment levels in rural Afghanistan). All prices are assumed to&#13;
remain constant inreal terms throughout the life o f the project.&#13;
&#13;
Proiect Benefits&#13;
&#13;
Project benefits are estimated by aggregating on-farm net income increases. Table 5 below shows&#13;
the implementation pace assumed for the evaluation. It shows farmers entering into the project&#13;
extension coverage and adopting the proposed improvements, either planting or rehabilitating&#13;
orchards (40,000 farmers), or improving milk or poultry production activities (37,400). These&#13;
numbers are excluding about 15 percent of the beneficiaries that would fail in adopting the&#13;
proposed modifications intheir production systems.&#13;

&#13;
Proiect Costs&#13;
&#13;
Total project costs were deducted from the expected flow o f benefits to get the final net flows for&#13;
the project and each component, including all "incentive" costs, the extension and other services&#13;
and the HLP capacity building and administration costs. The cost o f incentives and services for&#13;
those farmers failing to adopt the proposed changes are also considered.&#13;
&#13;
Incremental Production&#13;
&#13;
Increased production from horticulture i s estimated to reach about 32,000MT o f grapes and&#13;
similar amount of pomegranates, and 4,000 MT o f almonds at project maturity (PY5 to PY7).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 77&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
These incremental supplies could be easily absorbed domestically, but it i s expected that the&#13;
limited levels o f current exports to neighboring countries will be expanded. During project&#13;
implementation, markets for these products would be analyzed and exports organized by the&#13;
Horticulture Development Council of Afghanistan to be created under the HLP.&#13;
&#13;
Milkproduction is expected to grow from about 8,500 to 17,000 MT/year, out of which between&#13;
13,000 and 16,000 MT would be processed by the dairy plant financed by the project, and whose&#13;
products would be marketed for internal consumption, thus reducing imports. Incremental poultry&#13;
production would reach 107 million o f eggs and 1,754 MT o f meat at project maturity (PY5).&#13;
These levels are also expected to be easily absorbed by domestic markets, thereby reducing&#13;
imports. Animal health activities under HLP would have a significant additional impact on&#13;
increased production; however, no effort has beenmade to project these values.&#13;
&#13;
EconomicRateof Return(ERR)&#13;
&#13;
ERR on the HLP investments over 20 years is estimated at 40.2 percent. Assuming a 12 percent&#13;
discount rate for the expected costs and benefits, the Net Present Value (NPV) would reach to&#13;
US$104.7 million. Considering the main components separately (excluding the capacity building&#13;
component), the ERR would be 32.7 percent for horticulture, 81 percent for the dairy&#13;
subcomponent, and 49.9 percent for the poultry subcomponent.&#13;

Major Risks and SensitivityAnalysis.&#13;
&#13;
The most significant risks related to the project are: (i)delays because o f the poor institutional&#13;
 capacity on the implementing agency or political interference which could affect technical,&#13;
procurement andor disbursements activities; (ii)  escalation o f project and agricultural production&#13;
 costs; and (iii)&#13;
               lower than expected levels of farmer's adoption o f the new technologies, resulting&#13;
 inareducedproduction impact. These risks, individually or combined, can affect the ERR.Inthe&#13;
 case of the individual effects, the results and estimated probability o f occurrence are shown in&#13;

Expected Economic Rate of Return&#13;
&#13;
The project seems to be strong enough to support the adverse independent occurrence o f the&#13;
mentioned risks. When combining the three uncertainty factors (implementation delays, cost&#13;
escalation, and lower than expected impact) weighted by their probability o f occurrence, the&#13;
effects are estimated in different situations, resulting in eight different probabilities and&#13;
corresponding ERRS.UsingICRISK'' software, it was estimated that the expected ERR of the&#13;
project i s 24oercent, and that the probability o f obtaining a higher ERR than 24 percent would&#13;
be 0.60.&#13;

&#13;
Procurement for the proposed project will be carried out in accordance with the World Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines: Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits" dated May 2004; and "Guidelines:&#13;
Selection and Employment o f Consultants by World Bank Borrowers" dated M a y 2004, and the&#13;
provisions stipulated in the Development Grant Agreement. The Bank's Standard Bidding Documents,&#13;
Requests for Proposals and Forms o f Consultant Contract will be used. Incase o f conflicticontradiction&#13;
between the Bank's procurement procedures and any national rules and regulations, the Bank's&#13;
procurement procedures will take precedence. The general descriptions o f various items under different&#13;
expenditure category are described below. For each contract to be financed by the proposed grant, the&#13;
different procurement methods or consultant selection methods, the need for prequalification, estimated&#13;
costs, prior review requirements, and time frame are agreed between the Borrower and the Bank project&#13;
team in the Procurement Plan. The Procurement Plan will be updated at least annually or as required to&#13;
reflect the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity. A General&#13;
Procurement Notice has been submitted for publishingin UNDPiDgMarket in April 2006, indicating&#13;
the major packages to be procured under the project. Considering the nature o f the item, RCC posts&#13;
shall be procuredthrough N C B procedure.&#13;
&#13;
ProcurementResponsibility:The Ministryo f Agriculture and Irrigation (MAI) will be responsible for&#13;
procurement under the project. At present, the procurement capacity within the Ministry i s weak and&#13;
therefore the procurement risk i s rated high. In order to mitigate the risk, An Implementation&#13;
Management Support Team (IMST), composed o f qualified national and international staff, will be&#13;
created under the project, with substantial support from a consulting firm. In view o f the number o f&#13;
packages and the magnitude o f procurement, the IMST will include at least two capable International&#13;
Procurement Specialists familiar with the procurement under World Bank financed projects, with&#13;
adequate support staff. The recipient will also arrange to provide necessary orientation training and&#13;
guidance on World Bank procurementprocedures to the staff o f IMST and the Ministry.The IMST will&#13;
also receive necessary assistance and guidance from Afghanistan Reconstruction and Development&#13;
Services Procurement Unit (ARDS), which i s the Central Procurement Consultant to the Government o f&#13;
Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement of Goods: Goods procured under this project will include various types o f specialized&#13;
equipment, dairy processing plant, posts and wires, tree seedlings, plants, fertilizers, vaccines, vehicles,&#13;
furniture, office equipment such as computers and accessories, photocopiers, and fax machines. The&#13;
procurement will be done using Bank's Standard Bidding Documents (SBD). The estimated cost o f&#13;
such expenditure i s expected to be about US$20.1 million. The goods shall be procured by following&#13;
the international competitive bidding(ICB), national competitive bidding (NCB), shopping, and Direct&#13;
Contracting procedures.&#13;
&#13;
Procurement of Works: Works procured under this project will include rehabilitation o f several&#13;
buildings, construction o f offices, training centers, dairy processingunit, and feed processing units,The&#13;
procurementwill be done using the Bank's SBDs. The estimated cost o f such expenditure i s expected to&#13;
be about US$3.2 million. The works shall be procured by following the ICB, NCB, Shopping and&#13;
Direct Contracting procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                       80&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Selection of Consultants: There shall be several major technical assistance (TA) packages: (i)12&#13;
separate packages to provide TA in Project Management and Implementation, (ii)           TA for cashmere&#13;
fiber development, (iii) TA for satellite imagery and analysis, and (iv) TA intraining and development.&#13;
Inaddition there will be around 20 assignments for individual consultants. The estimated cost of such&#13;
consultancies i s expected to be about US$lO.O million for personnel and $5.1 million for training, Short&#13;
lists o f consultants for services estimated to cost less than $50,000 equivalent per contract may be&#13;
composed entirely o f national consultants in accordance with the provisions o f paragraph 2.7 of the&#13;
Consultant Guidelines. For services exceeding US$200,000 or more Quality and Cost Based Selection&#13;
(QCBS), Quality Based Selection (QBS) or Single Source Selection (SSS) shall be used as appropriate,&#13;
For services estimated to cost less than US$200,000 QCBS, SBCQS, Least Cost Selection (LCS), Fixed&#13;
Budget Selection (FBS), and SSS shall be used. There will be several long term large value contracts&#13;
for individual consultants selected following Section V. The lead Facilitating Partner will be contracted&#13;
through QBS procedures. Single Source Selection o f consultants, both individuals and firms, shall be&#13;
allowed. However, before starting the process for SSS, where the estimated cost exceeds US$50,000,&#13;
complete justification shall be furnished to the Bank for each individual case for prior approval.&#13;
Selection o f training institutes, government research institutions, universities, specialized international&#13;
organizations, and NGOs for carrying out capacity building programs, special studies, and research&#13;
programs may be awarded following QBS, CQS or SSS methods with prior clearance o f the Bank. The&#13;
estimated cost o f consultancy services i s expected to be about US$lO.O million.&#13;
&#13;
Others:There will be a staff development program for the staff engaged inthe Horticulture and&#13;
Livestock sector duringthe project implementation. The training will be provided mainly on the job by&#13;
availing the staff to work with Facilitating Partners contracted both to IMST and project field&#13;
operations. Inaddition, staff will be provided training by periodic exposure to Internationalworkshops&#13;
and technical visits abroad.&#13;
&#13;
B. Assessmentof the Agency's Capacity to ImdementProcurement:&#13;
&#13;
A preliminary assessment o f procurement capacity within the Ministry was made by the Appraisal&#13;
Team through discussions with the concerned official in mid-January 2006 and it was found that the&#13;
procurement capacity within the Ministry i s weak.          As the MA1 personnel concerned are not&#13;
conversant with World Bank procedures, the Ministry will be unable to handle the specialized nature&#13;
o f large procurement under the project without assistance. Therefore, the following mitigation&#13;
measures have been agreed:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0    Appointment o f Implementing Management Support Team (IMST) having competent&#13;
          procurement personnel&#13;
     0    Assistance and guidance from A R D S&#13;
     0    Arranging periodic training o f staff&#13;
&#13;
The overall procurement riskwith above measures i s considered Medium.&#13;
&#13;
C. ProcurementPlan&#13;
&#13;
The recipient has developed an Initial Procurement Plan for project implementation which provides&#13;
the basis for the procurement methods. This plan i s available (attachment 1). The Procurement Plan&#13;
was updated during Appraisal o f the Project, and it will be updated annually or as required to reflect&#13;
the actual project implementation needs and improvements in institutional capacity. Draft bidding&#13;
documents, agreed NCB documents, and a draft procurement manuals have been prepared by the&#13;
recipient and submitted to the Bank for review inApril 2006.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                        81&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
D. FrequencyofProcurementSupervision&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the prior review supervision to be carried out from Bank offices, the capacity&#13;
assessment o f the Implementing Agency suggests at least two supervision missions per year to visit&#13;
the field to carry outpost review o f procurement actions.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
Status of FinancialManagementinAfghanistan&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank has gained substantial experience and understanding o f the financial management&#13;
environment inAfghanistan through the large number o f projects under implementation over the past&#13;
four years. The primary instrument to enhance the established fiduciary measures and ensure&#13;
increased transparency and accountability for the funding provided by the Bank and other donors i s&#13;
the Public Administration Capacity Buildingproject (PACB).&#13;
A Public FinancialManagement (PFM) performance rating system using28 high-level indicators that&#13;
was developed by the Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) multi-agency&#13;
partnership program was applied in Afghanistan in June 2005. PEFA i s comprised o f the World&#13;
Bank, IMF, EC, and several other international agencies. The system i s structured around six core&#13;
dimensions o f PFM performance: i)budget credibility, ii)comprehensiveness and transparency, iii)&#13;
policy-based budgeting, iv) predictability and control in budget execution, v) accounting, recording,&#13;
and reporting, and vi) external scrutiny and audit. Afghanistan's ratings against the PFM indicators&#13;
generally portray a public sector where financial resources are, by and large, being used for their&#13;
intended purposes. This has been accomplished with very high levels o f support from international&#13;
firms; this assistance will continue to be needed over the medium term if these ratings are to be&#13;
maintained. There i s also much room for improvement across the PFMareas.&#13;
In spite o f undeniable gains made in reconstruction since the end o f 2001, the challenges facing&#13;
Afghanistan remain immense; not least because o f the tenuous security situation and continued&#13;
prevalence o f a large illegal and illicit economy. The policy framework benchmarks have not yet been&#13;
fully costed so various priorities are fundedthrough the annual budgeting process. The rising costs of&#13;
the security sector constitute the major constraint on attainment o f fiscal sustainability. With regard to&#13;
executive oversight, the national assembly will play an increasingly active role. All in all, the new&#13;
national strategy has created highexpectations o f the executive which could prove to be quite difficult&#13;
to meet.&#13;
The public sector, in spite o f considerable efforts to reform its core functions, remains extremely&#13;
weak outside o f Kabul. The lack o f qualified staff in the civil service and the absence o f qualified&#13;
counterparts in the government after 30 years or war and conflicts i s a binding constraint. Delays in&#13;
reforming the pay structure and grading o f civil servants have severely crippled the public&#13;
administration o f the country. Domestic revenues lag behind expenditures by a factor o f ten to one.&#13;
Large-scale corruption could emerge to undermine the government's efforts to enhance aid flows&#13;
through national accounts. Capacities to track expenditures and monitor expenditure outcomes have&#13;
improved, but they need rapid and substantial strengthening if progress toward the attainment o f&#13;
national development targets i s to be monitored. Currently, 75% o f external revenues bypass&#13;
government appropriation systems.&#13;
To help support critical centralized public sector administration functions, the World Bank i s&#13;
 financing a Financial Management Advisor to assist the Ministry o f Finance, an Audit Advisor to&#13;
 assist the Control and Audit Office, and a Procurement Advisor to assist in Procurement-related&#13;
 activities. Also an Internal Audit function i s being developed within the Ministry o f Finance with&#13;
World Bank financing. USAID and earlier the Indian Aid Assistance Program are also financing a&#13;
team o f consultants and advisors to assist the D a Afghanistan Bank in local as well as foreign&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    90&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
currency operations. The activities carried out under the existing Public Administration projects have&#13;
helped the Government to ensure that appropriate fiduciary standards are maintained for public&#13;
expenditures, including those supported by the Bank and the donor community.&#13;
Progress has been slower than expected in shifting from operations support provided by the three&#13;
Advisors to capacity development and knowledge transfer to the civil servants. Given that, i s&#13;
expected that the Advisors will continue to be required for the medium term. Challenges still remain&#13;
in attaining the agreed upon fiduciary standards and also to further enhance them. And to make&#13;
matters more complex, the regulatory environment in Afghanistan has advanced significantly in the&#13;
past three years. Unfortunately, even mastery o f basic skills in the early environment does not fully&#13;
qualify the civil servants to work effectively inthe new emergingenvironment.&#13;
The activities carried out under the Public Administration capacity Building Project (PACBP) have&#13;
helped the government ensure that appropriate fiduciary standards are maintained, as well as&#13;
continuing to ensure that standards are further enhanced and that capacity i s developed in government&#13;
to maintain these standards. The systems that are currently in place for externally-aided projects will&#13;
be used for all financial management matters o f the Horticulture and Livestock Project (HLP).&#13;

&#13;
S engths and Weaknesses of the Financial Management Operations&#13;
&#13;
Strengths. The main strength i s the government's commitment to accountability and transparency in&#13;
its operations, which provides assurance to the Bank and other donors that the measures in place to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 92&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ensure appropriate utilization o f funds will not be circumvented. The government support for PACB&#13;
strengthens the financial management function in Treasury operations, the public procurement&#13;
function, the internal audit function inthe public sector and the external audit functions o f the Auditor&#13;
General.&#13;
&#13;
Weaknesses. The main weakness in this project - in common with projects in other ministries - is&#13;
the inability to attract suitably qualified and experienced counterpart staff. This project is the first&#13;
management responsibility o f a foreign grant for MAI, and the Policy and Planning Department staff&#13;
have no experience in dealing effectively with donor agencies. To address this weakness, MA1staff&#13;
involved at multiple levels, within and outside Policy and Planning Department, will be involved in&#13;
financial management o f the project working alongside the FP.&#13;
&#13;
ImplementingEntity&#13;
&#13;
The MA1 will be responsible for implementing HLP and has recently initiated reforms o f its&#13;
administrative and financial functions. The Head o f Development Budget will work closely with the&#13;
Financial Management Specialist (FMS) o f the lead FP to carry out day-to-day financial management&#13;
operations o f the project, preparation o f M-16 forms (payment orders), and overall contract and&#13;
project management.&#13;
&#13;
Staffing&#13;
&#13;
To ensure comprehensive management o f HLP finances, the lead Facilitating Partner o f IMST will&#13;
hire a Financial Management Specialist to perform key project functions and to help develop&#13;
capabilities o f the MA1 Administrative Department, including training staff at the national and&#13;
provincial levels. Pending this recruitment, an international financial management consultant working&#13;
with USAID-RAMP for MA1has been assigned to provide support for financial management o f HLP.&#13;
This FMS of the Facilitating Partner and the local counterpart FMS will both be members o f the&#13;
IMST. Other Facilitating Partners at the regional level will also have financial management staff as&#13;
core team members. Over the course o f the project as needed, additional FM staff will be engaged&#13;
and trained.&#13;
&#13;
Budgeting&#13;
&#13;
Because limited capacity exists within MA1to manage the external budget, the FMS will be chartered&#13;
to strengthen the financial management capacity o f MAI. Additionally, other FPs at the regional level&#13;
will have financial management staff as core team members. The FMS will be responsible for&#13;
 ensuring that project expenditures expended in a fiscal year are captured in the Governmental&#13;
Development budget o f that fiscal year. The MA1must get an approval from the presidential office&#13;
 and the parliament to be attached to D1 forms at the time o f requesting yearly allotments for contracts&#13;
 under development project to avoid delays when payments are processed.&#13;
&#13;
 FundsFlow&#13;
&#13;
 The standard mechanism o f flow o f funds in Afghanistan will be followed in this project. Project&#13;
 funds will be deposited in the Designated Account (DA) to be opened and maintained at the Da&#13;
 Afghanistan Bank (DaB) or in a local commercial bank, if approved. The DA, in keeping with&#13;
 current practices for other projects in Afghanistan, will be operated by the Special Disbursement Unit&#13;
 (SDU) in the Treasury Department o f MoF. Requests for payments out o f the DA will be made to the&#13;
 SDU by the implementing entity when needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    93&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
In addition to payments out of DA funds, the implementing entities could also request the SDU to&#13;
make direct payments to consultants or consulting firms, and special commitments for contracts&#13;
covered by letters o f credit will follow the World Bank procedures. All project payments are&#13;
expected to be made to either international firms or local firms that have bank accounts in DaB, a&#13;
local commercial bank, or an overseas bank. All payments will be made either through bank transfers&#13;
into the account o f such firms or by check.&#13;
&#13;
T o provide in-kind grants under the horticultural component, IMST will enter into contracts with&#13;
private nurseries to provide a package o f fertilizers, plants, and other supplies directly to farmers. To&#13;
acquire the package from nurseries, farmers will use vouchers along with their own contributions.&#13;
The vouchers will be allocated to specific farmers based on each community's decision (through&#13;
Community Development Councils whenever possible). The exact implementation and control&#13;
mechanisms o f the grant schemes will be established by the Facilitating Partner in each instance to&#13;
meet the sub-project's development and control objectives. As control mechanisms, these procedures&#13;
will be fully documented and cash transfers will not take place throughFPs inprovinces.&#13;
&#13;
Retroactive financing of up to U S 0 . 5 million i s envisaged for the goods and services related to start-&#13;
up activities between April 5, 2006 and the time o f grant signing. The retroactive finance can be&#13;
claimed only after the grant becomes effective.&#13;
&#13;
Accounting Policies and Procedures&#13;
&#13;
The SDU will maintain a proper accounting system o f all expenditures incurred along with all the&#13;
supporting documents to enable IDA to verify these expenditures. The Financial Management&#13;
Specialist and the government counterparts will: i)supervise preparation o f supporting documents for&#13;
expenditures, ii)prepare payment orders (Form M16), iii)obtain approval for M-16s by the Minister&#13;
or Deputy Minister depending on the payment amount, and iv) submit them to the Treasury&#13;
Department in M o F for verification and payment. The FM Advisor in the MoF/SDU will use the&#13;
government's computerizedaccounting system, AFMIS for reporting, financial statements, and audits.&#13;
&#13;
Currently, all records o f payments by MA1 are filed manually. However, the FMS will establish a&#13;
 simple tracking and reporting system in PPD. The FMS and the government counterpart will train&#13;
existing MA1 staff to record project expenditures in spreadsheets to maintain accurate and timely&#13;
 financial data for the project. The FMS will develop a Financial Management Manual outlining&#13;
 guidelines for project financial management that i s subject to review and approval by the Bank. The&#13;
 manual will include roles and responsibilities o f all FM staff, documentation and approval procedures&#13;
 for funds transfers in each of the subprograms, project reporting requirements, and quality assurance&#13;
measures to help ensure that adequate internal controls and procedures are in place and are being&#13;
 followed.&#13;
&#13;
 The lead Facilitating Partner will establish project financial management inaccordance with standard&#13;
 Afghan government policies and procedures, including use o f the government Chart o f Accounts to&#13;
record project expenditures. The use o f these procedures will enable adequate recording and reporting&#13;
 of project expenditures. Overall project accounts will be maintained centrally in SDU, which will be&#13;
 ultimately responsible for accounting for all expenditures and receipts in the Government's&#13;
 accounting system. Reconciliation of project expenditure with M o F records will be carried out by the&#13;
 Administration and Finance Department along with the Policy and Planning Department. This will be&#13;
 supported by the Financial Management Specialist who will ensure that monthly and yearly&#13;
reconciliation for project expenditures are carried out by MA1with Treasury-MoF.              Consolidated&#13;
project accounts will be maintained centrally in M o F through the SDU in the Treasury. Consolidated&#13;
project financial statements will be prepared for all sources and uses o fproject funds.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                     94&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Internal Audit&#13;
&#13;
The project financial management systems will be subject to review by the newly-established Internal&#13;
Audit Directorate o f the MoF, according to programs to be determined by the Director o f Internal&#13;
Audit. A risk-based approach will be applied to the internal audit work program to better focus the&#13;
efforts on areas o f maximum impact or perceived internal control weaknesses.&#13;
&#13;
ExternalAudit&#13;
&#13;
The accounts o f HLP will be audited by the Auditor General, with the support o f the Audit Advisor,&#13;
following terms o f reference satisfactory to IDA. The audit o f the project accounts will include an&#13;
assessment o f the: (a) adequacy o f the accounting and internal control systems; (b) ability to maintain&#13;
adequate documentation for transactions; and (c) eligibility o f incurred expenditures for IDA&#13;
financing. The audited annual project financial statements will be submitted to IDA within six months&#13;
of the close o f fiscal year. All agencies involved in implementation and holding records o f&#13;
expenditures would need to retain these records as per the IDA retentionpolicy. The following audit&#13;
reports will be monitored inthe Audit Reports Compliance System (ARCS):&#13;

Reportingand Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
Interim unaudited Financial Reports will be used for project monitoring and supervision. Based on the&#13;
FM arrangements o f this project, these reports will be prepared by the FMS with the help of local&#13;
counterpart in PPD based on records kept on spreadsheets or database. Quarterly Financial Reports&#13;
will be produced showing: (i)sources and uses of funds by disbursement category and project&#13;
component; (ii)physical progress; and (iii)status o f procurement activities. The Civil Services&#13;
Commission will forward the relevant details to the Development Budget and External Relation&#13;
(DBER) unit for consolidation, if any, with a copy to IDA within 45 days o f the end of the quarter.&#13;
The government and IDA have agreed on a pro forma format for all Bank projects. Annual project&#13;
accounts will be consolidated centrally in M o F by the Treasury Department supported by FMA, and&#13;
consolidated project financial statements will be prepared for all sources and uses o f project funds.&#13;
&#13;
Table 1 shows the allocation o f IDA proceeds and Table 2 the expected cofinancing. A single&#13;
category for "goods, works, consultants's services, training and operating costs" i s defined in the&#13;
 financing agreement to facilitate preparation o f disbursement applications and record-keeping. Project&#13;
 funds will be disbursed over 42 months. The closing date of the project will be December 31, 2009,&#13;
with a final disbursement deadline four months after the closing date (grace period).&#13;

                                        TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A. Background&#13;
&#13;
Afghanistan i s a rugged, land-locked, mountainous country (more than half o f its area o f nearly 65&#13;
million ha i s 2000m above sea level) with an estimated population o f around 25 million. Afghanistan&#13;
i s among the poorest countries in the world and agriculture i s central to the Afghan economy with the&#13;
sector contributing an estimated 53 percent to the GDP and providing employment for 67 percent o f&#13;
the labor force. Nearly 80 percent o f the Afghan population lives in rural areas which also harbor the&#13;
highest incidence o f poverty. Agricultural performance is therefore pivotal for overall economic&#13;
growth and poverty reduction and offers the only significant prospect for raising farmer incomes,&#13;
contributing to food security, providing rural employment, and reducing the vulnerability o f resource&#13;
poor rural people.&#13;
&#13;
B. Purpose of the Environmentaland Social SafeguardsFramework(ESSF)&#13;
&#13;
It is acknowledged that currently social and environmental management in Afghanistan is facing&#13;
critical capacity constraints. Keeping in view the existing environmental management capacity, as&#13;
well as the flexibility required as not all investments are known at the time o f project appraisal, a&#13;
framework approach i s adopted. The ESSF has been developed specifically for the proposed&#13;
operations to ensure due diligence, to avoid causing harm or exacerbating social tensions, and to&#13;
ensure consistent treatment o f social and environmental issues by the Government o f Afghanistan,&#13;
addressing the following issues. Consistent with existing national legislation, the objective o f the&#13;
Framework i s to help ensure that activities under the project will:&#13;
&#13;
     0   Protect human health;&#13;
&#13;
     0   Prevent or compensate any loss o f livelihood;&#13;
&#13;
     0   Prevent environmental degradation as a result o f either individual subprojects or their&#13;
         cumulative effects;&#13;
&#13;
     0   Minimize impacts on cultural property;&#13;
&#13;
     0   Enhance positive environmental and social outcomes; and&#13;
&#13;
     0   Ensure compliance with World Bank Safeguards policies.&#13;
&#13;
C. GeneralPrinciples&#13;
&#13;
Recognizing the emergency nature o f the proposed operation, and the related need for providing&#13;
assistance, the Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework (ESSF) provides general policies,&#13;
guidelines, codes o f practice and procedures to be integrated into the implementation o f the proposed&#13;
operation for providing assistance, while at the same time ensuring due diligence in managing&#13;
potential environmental and social risks. This Framework i s based on the following principles:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0   The proposed operation will comprise several sub-projects, the detailed designs o f which may&#13;
         not be known at appraisal. To ensure the effective application of the World Bank's safeguard&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     98&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
       policies, the Framework provides guidance on the approach to be taken during&#13;
       implementation for the selection and design o f sub-projects, and the planning o f mitigation&#13;
       measures;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0   All proposed sub-projects will be screened to ensure that the environmental and social risks&#13;
        can be adequately addressed through the application o f standardized guidelines;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0    The proposed operation will finance feasibility or pre-feasibility studies for&#13;
        subsequent investments, which will include environmental and social impact assessments, as&#13;
        required by World Bank safeguard policies;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0    Project design and sub-project selection will aim to maintain regional balance, and equity&#13;
        between genders, and ethnic and religious groups, considering variations in population&#13;
        density, and security considerations. Employment opportunities within the projects will be&#13;
        available on an equal basis to all, on the basis o f professional competence, irrespective o f&#13;
        gender, or ethnic or religious group. In all projects which require consultations with local&#13;
        communities or beneficiaries, consultations will be conducted to elicit the views o f both the&#13;
        male and the female population; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   0    Consultation and disclosure requirements will be simplified to meet the special needs o f this&#13;
        project. Prior to approval by the World Bank Board, this Environmental and Social&#13;
        Safeguards Framework will be disclosed in Afghanistan inDari and Pashto, and inthe World&#13;
        Bank Infoshop.&#13;
&#13;
D. ProjectObjectives&#13;
To stimulate perennial horticulture and livestock marketable output in focus areas by improving the&#13;
incentives framework for private investments and strengthening institutional capacity in agriculture.&#13;
Specific objectives include:&#13;
&#13;
    0   Improvements in the production capacity o f the horticultural and livestock sectors and&#13;
        improvement o f market channels for Afghan produces&#13;
&#13;
    0   Involvement o f women farmers who will particularly benefit from project activities through the&#13;
        major role that they play inhorticulture and livestockproduction&#13;
&#13;
    0   At a higher level, the project will have a positive impact on broad-based economic growth in&#13;
        focus rural areas by increasing the demand for rural non-farm sector output and from&#13;
        multiplierson farmers' expenditure&#13;
&#13;
    0   On the institution front, project support for the restructuring o f MA1will help to develop the&#13;
        basis for a strong policy, regulatory and support.organization for the agriculture sector&#13;
&#13;
    0    Overall, these benefits will contribute to the Bank's rural poverty reduction goals as well as&#13;
        providing a key element o f a counter narcotics strategy by fostering an alternative to poppies&#13;
         and, at the same time, stimulating rural incomes through expanding the rural non-farm sector&#13;
        which encompasses the bulk o f the poor.&#13;
&#13;
E.ProjectDescription&#13;
&#13;
Project comprises three components: 1) Increasing marketable perennial horticulture output&#13;
(US$23.7 million)comprising works, goods, services and grants for: (i)     rehabilitating existing orchards&#13;
and establishing perennial tree crop cultivations through TA and grants; (ii)   establishing a Horticulture&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      99&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Development Council o f Afghanistan (HDCA) and developing MA1capacity for policy planning and&#13;
supporting horticulture producers; and (iii)  supporting pilot activities on the private sector green raisin&#13;
and pomegranate export clusters; 2) Increasing Livestock Output and Productivity (US $20.2&#13;
million) comprising works, goods, services and grants for strengthening institutions inlivestock-related&#13;
services in areas not already covered by other projects. This includes: supporting the reorganizing the&#13;
General Directorate for Livestock Protection and Development (GDLPD); promoting livestock&#13;
production and marketing initiatives in order to permit import substitution and stimulate exports o f&#13;
animal products; studies with pastoral communities to improve rangelands management; and&#13;
establishing a publiciprivate partnership in veterinary medicine to ensure a stronger regulatory&#13;
government role and better profitability and sustainability o f privatized field veterinary services; 3)&#13;
Capacity Building, Implementation and Monitoring &amp; Evaluation Support (US$6.0 million)&#13;
comprising goods, services and incremental operating costs for developing human and physical&#13;
capacity in policy formulation, programming development, financial management and procurement,&#13;
supervising and monitoring and evaluating impact. This will enable MA1 to ensure efficient&#13;
implementationo f the HLP and other projects.&#13;
&#13;
F.PotentialImpact ofVarious Components&#13;
&#13;
Activities under the project should not entail significant and negative environmental and social impacts,&#13;
provided they are designed and implementedwith due consideration o f environmental and social issues.&#13;
The project falls in the B category for environmental and social issues. The present framework i s then&#13;
adopted as a mean o f ensuring due diligence inmanaging potential environmental and social risks inthe&#13;
different sub-projects.&#13;
&#13;
OP/BP 4.01 Environmental Assessment (triggered). The HLP aims at harnessing orchard and&#13;
livestock productivity increase in selected priority areas with the goal o f creating new opportunity for&#13;
farmers and building on-the-ground capacity for the delivery o f efficient services to the farmers. The&#13;
interventions proposed essentially relate to the rehabilitation o f existing orchards and that have been&#13;
partly neglected or destroyed by the war and encouraging livestock production by small-scale farmers.&#13;
Hence, developments proposed for perennial tree crops are likely to have a positive impact through&#13;
promoting nursery development that will lead to increased orchard areas. However small-scale impacts&#13;
may arise inadvertently, in the unlikely event that the selection, planning, and implementation o f the&#13;
sub-project interventions and demonstration sites are inadequate. Although, specific sub-project&#13;
interventions are not known at this point o f time (but will be known when locations for sub-projects are&#13;
selected), attention in the selection o f sub-projects should focus on the following potential threats: (1)&#13;
use o f pesticide and insecticides that may cause harm to natural resources and human health; (2)&#13;
unsustainable grazing causing land degradation (increased erosion); (3) possible effluents from the&#13;
diary units; (4) limited construction activities.&#13;
&#13;
OP 4.09 Pest Management (triggered). The productivity increase component of the HLP depends&#13;
partly on the ability to adequately control pest populations. This triggers OP4.09 on Pest Management&#13;
and sound application o f an integrated pest management plan i s required. Pest management should be&#13;
seen as a way o f improving the sustainability o f horticulture practices, by adopting appropriate cultural&#13;
practices (such as the planting o f alfalfa cover crop and efficient on-farm water management),&#13;
biological control (involving the use o f natural pest enemies) and, when necessary, chemical control&#13;
(involving the use o fpesticides).&#13;
&#13;
OP 4.37 Safety of Dams (not triggered). The project does involve the construction o f new dams and&#13;
does not depend upon existingdams.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                       100&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
OPBP 4.36 Forests (not triggered). The HLP focuses on the rehabilitation of existing orchards.&#13;
Operations are expected to take place in privately owned land and are not expected to impact on the&#13;
health and quality o f forests, or on their management, protection or utilizationregimes.&#13;
&#13;
OP 4.04 Natural Habitats (not triggered). No significant conversion or degradation o f natural&#13;
habitats i s expected under the HLP. On the contrary, the project i s likely to produce positive impacts on&#13;
landscapes. As a consequence o f more than twenty years o f conflict, agricultural land has been&#13;
impacted directly by war operations and indirectly by environmentally damaging subsistence practices.&#13;
The project i s expected to identify horticultural products that are appropriate to specific regions and&#13;
rehabilitate the agricultural landscapes.&#13;
&#13;
OP 7.50 Projects on InternationalWaterways (not triggered). OP 7.50 does not apply to the project,&#13;
given the localized nature of the project and the fact that the project essentially involves rehabilitation&#13;
o f existingorchards and livestock farms. It does not involve works and activities that would exceed the&#13;
original scheme, change its nature, or alter and expand its scope and extend to make it appear a new or&#13;
different scheme. The team believes that given the nature o f the works envisaged under the proposed&#13;
project: (a) the project will not adversely affect the quality or quantity o f water flows to the other&#13;
riparians; and (b) it will not be adversely affected by other riparians' water use.&#13;
&#13;
OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement (not triggered). No involuntary resettlement or landacquisition is&#13;
anticipated under the project. Inthe current socio-political context in the rural areas, involuntary land&#13;
acquisition based on the state's eminent domain i s unlikely for the kind o f small-scale activities that&#13;
will be undertaken under the project for two reasons. If any minor areas o f land would be needed for a&#13;
project (e.g. construction o f veterinary clinics, field office and so forth), such land could only be&#13;
obtained through either private voluntary donations, compensation paid by the community (i.e.&#13;
transaction between willing buyer-willing seller), or, more likely, from available government land.&#13;
Private voluntary donations and community purchases would be documented as required by the&#13;
Framework, and for government land, documentation would be needed that the land i s free o f&#13;
encroachments, squatters or other encumbrances, and has been transferred to the project by the&#13;
authorities.&#13;
&#13;
OPBP 4.10 Indigenous Peoples (not triggered). There are no communities inAfghanistan which can&#13;
be defined as `indigenous peoples'. But the design for the project defines a strategy, which will ensure&#13;
that ethnicireligious minority groups are included as beneficiaries, and that their concerns are addressed&#13;
in compliance with the requirements of OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples. The key elements of this&#13;
 strategy are: (i) horticulture and intensive livestock production activities will be open to all farmers in&#13;
the project area;     (ii)the pilot activities with pastoralists are specifically designedto demonstrate&#13;
approaches and legislative changes that would benefit nomadic and sedentary communities living inthe&#13;
 same areas; and (iii) independent monitoring by civil society (NGOs and the press) will provide another&#13;
mechanism to identify cases where ethnic minority groups would have been bypassed or marginalized&#13;
by project operations. Exclusion based on gender is also addressed in the project design through&#13;
 specific efforts to reach women as producers both within horticulture and livestock component.&#13;
&#13;
 OPN 11.03 Cultural Property (not triggered). The proposed operations are unlikely to pose a risk of&#13;
 damaging cultural property. Section K includes a list o f negative o f attributes, which would make a sub-&#13;
project ineligible for support, including any activity that would significantly damage non-replicable&#13;
 cultural property. Chance finds during implementation o f sub-projects involving civil works will be&#13;
reported to the provincial or district governors, who then will inform the Archaeological Committee as&#13;
per the Chance FindProcedures listed in Section M.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      101&#13;

G.Safeguards Screening&#13;
&#13;
The selection, design, contracting, monitoring and evaluation o f subprojects will be consistent with the&#13;
following guidelines:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   A negative list o f characteristics that would make a proposed subproject ineligible for support&#13;
        (Section K)&#13;
    0   Guidelines for land and asset acquisition, entitlements and compensation (Section L)&#13;
    0   Procedures for the protection o f cultural property, including the chance discovery o f&#13;
        archaeological artifacts, and unrecorded graveyards and burial sites (Section M).&#13;
    0   Relevant elements o f the codes of practice for the mitigation of potential environmental impacts&#13;
        (Section N).&#13;
    0   The requirement that confirmation i s received through the Regional Mine Action center that&#13;
        areas to be accessed duringproject activities have been demined (Section 0)&#13;
&#13;
H.Responsibilitiesfor Safeguard ScreeningandMitigation&#13;
&#13;
Sound design will if not eliminate, at least diminish to the extent possible, most o f the potential&#13;
adverse impacts of project activities. The overall responsibility o f project implementation rests with&#13;
the Ministry o f Agriculture and Animal Husbandry and Food (MAI). The MA1will act through an&#13;
Implementation and Management Support Team (IMST) which will be headed by a Manager who&#13;
will be responsible fro the minister MA1for overall Project Implementation.&#13;
&#13;
An independent Monitoring and Evaluation unit with, inter alia, environmental and social specialists'&#13;
inputs have been proposed within the MAI. One of the M&amp;E specialists under HLP will also be&#13;
assigned as Safeguards Focal Officer and will be responsible for overseeing the implementation o f the&#13;
Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework. Safeguard monitoring capacity will be gradually&#13;
transferred to relevant MA1 staff to ensure continuity in safeguard application after project&#13;
completion. Duringthe operation stage, the M&amp;E Unit will carry out the monitoring o f the operations&#13;
also. It will confirm (from anecdotal evidence and, if required, laboratory testing) that the water&#13;
quality in the project area i s not adversely impacted due to agrochemicals, soil conditions are&#13;
conducive for growth o f crops normally grown in the region, and pathogens and vectors are under&#13;
control. In case o f incidence o f water related or water-transmitted disease, it will co-ordinate with the&#13;
local health department to ensure that the situation be brought under control in the shortest possible&#13;
time.&#13;
&#13;
Mitigation measures acceptable to the Bank are expected to be included inthe Operational Manual,&#13;
&#13;
I.CapacityBuilding&#13;
&#13;
As part o f the social and environmental capacity buildingthat will be provided for implementation o f&#13;
IDA-financed operations inAfghanistan, the Safeguards Focal Officer and relevant staff o f MA1and&#13;
implementing agencies/Consultants will receive training in the application o f the Safeguard&#13;
Framework. It i s proposed to prepare specific materials, hold a workshop, and arrange site visits to&#13;
other countries in the region on similar projects in progress to provide hands-on training to the&#13;
Ministry and implementing agency staff. Specialist training modules may be considered after an&#13;
acceptable level o f base knowledge has been established. Duringsupervision o f the project, the World&#13;
Bank will assess the implementation o f the Framework, and if required, will recommend additional&#13;
strengthening.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                                                                      103&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
 J. Consultation and Disclosure&#13;
&#13;
 This Environmental and Social Safeguards Framework was developed on the basis o f an overall&#13;
 Framework for World Bank-funded reconstruction operations which was prepared in consultation&#13;
 with the principal NGOs and development partners participating in reconstruction activities in&#13;
 Afghanistan. Prior to approval o f the project by the World Bank Board, it will be disclosed by the&#13;
 Government of Afghanistan in both Dari and Pashto, as well as English, and it will also be made&#13;
 available at the World Bank's Infoshop. It i s worth noting that Government o f Afghanistan intends to&#13;
 make all project documentation publicly available through the Afghan Information Management&#13;
 System (AIMS).&#13;

M.Protectionof CulturalProperty&#13;
&#13;
Physical culture includes monuments, structures, works o f art, or sites o f "outstanding universal&#13;
value" from the historical, aesthetic, scientific, ethnological, or anthropological point o f view,&#13;
including unrecorded graveyards and burial sites. Within this broader definition, cultural property i s&#13;
defined as sites and structures having archaeological, paleontological, historical, architectural, or&#13;
religious significance, and natural sites with cultural values.&#13;
&#13;
The proposed emergency reconstruction operations are unlikely to pose a risk o f damaging cultural&#13;
property, as the sub-projects will largely consist of small investments incommunity infrastructure and&#13;
income generating activities, reconstruction o f existing structures, and minor urban public works.&#13;
Further, the negative list o f attributes, which would make a subproject ineligible for support (Section&#13;
K), includes any activity that would significantly damage non-replicable cultural property.&#13;
Nevertheless, the following procedures for identification, protection from theft, and treatment o f&#13;
chance finds shouldbe followed and included in standardbid documents.&#13;
&#13;
ChanceFindProcedures&#13;
&#13;
Chance find procedures are defined in the law on Maintenance of Historical and Cultural Monuments&#13;
(Official Gazette, December 21, 1980), specifying the authorities and responsibilities of cultural&#13;
heritage agencies if sites or materials are discovered in the course o f project implementation. This&#13;
law establishes that all moveable and immovable historical and cultural artifacts are state property,&#13;
and further:&#13;
&#13;
     1. The responsibility for preservation, maintenance and assessment o f historical and cultural&#13;
         monuments rests with the Archaeological Committee under the Ministry o f Information and&#13;
         Culture, which has representation at provincial level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    109&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   2. Whenever chance finds o f cultural or historical artifacts (moveable and immovable) are made&#13;
       the Archaeological Committee should be informed. Should the continuation o f work&#13;
        endanger the historical and cultural artifacts, the project work should be suspended until a&#13;
        solution i s found for the preservation o f these artifacts.&#13;
&#13;
    3 . Ifamoveableorimmovablehistoricalorculturalartifactisfoundinthecountrysideofa&#13;
        province, the provincial governor (wali) or district-in-charge (woluswal) should be informed&#13;
        within two weeks, and they should inform the Archaeological Committee. In case the&#13;
        immovable historical or cultural artifact i s found in a city, the provincial branch o f the&#13;
        Department o f Maintenance o f Historical Values o f the Ministry o f Information and Culture&#13;
        should be informed within two weeks (art. 18). If the find i s made within the center, the&#13;
        Archaeological Committee must be informed directly within one week (art. 25).&#13;
&#13;
    4. Failure to report a chance find within the stipulated time limit will be punished with a fine or&#13;
        imprisonment for a period o f one week or up to one month (art. 72).&#13;
&#13;
    5.  Ifsomeone intentionallydamages ahistoricalor culturalartifact, the culprit shallpay&#13;
        compensation in accordance with the value o f the artifact plus be imprisoned for a period o f&#13;
        one month to ten years depending on the gravity o f the crime (art. 71).&#13;
&#13;
Incase of a chance find of moveableor immovablehistorical or cultural artifact, the implementing&#13;
agency i s responsible for securing the artifact from theft, pilferage and damage until the responsibility&#13;
has been taken over by the relevant authorities as specified above.&#13;
&#13;
These procedures must be referred to as standard provisions in construction contracts, when&#13;
applicable. During project supervision, the Site Engineer shall monitor that the above regulations&#13;
relating to the treatment o f any chance find encountered are observed.&#13;
&#13;
Relevant findings will be recorded in World Bank Project Supervision Reports (PSRs), and&#13;
Implementation Completion Reports (ICRs) will assess the overall effectiveness o f the project's&#13;
cultural resources mitigation, management, and capacity building activities, as appropriate.&#13;

0.Procedures for MineRiskManagementinWorldBank-FundedProjectsinAfghanistan&#13;
&#13;
Background:&#13;
&#13;
The following procedures are designed to respond to the risks caused by the presence o f mines in&#13;
Afghanistan, inthe context of:&#13;
&#13;
    e   Community rehabilitation / construction works to be identified and implemented by the&#13;
        communities themselves (for small projects of up to $100,000 each);&#13;
    e   Small and medium-size works to be identifiedby local authorities and implementedby local&#13;
        contractors (for projects upto $5m each);&#13;
    e    Works to be implemented directly by Government departments/agencies, without use o f&#13;
        contractors;&#13;
    e   Large works to be implementedby contractors (for projects above $5m);&#13;
&#13;
General comment applying to all following procedures: All risk assessment and clearance tasks shall&#13;
be implemented in coordination with the Mine Action Center for Afghanistan (MACA).              These&#13;
procedures may need to be amended inthe future depending on evolving circumstances.&#13;
&#13;
Procedurefor Community-ManagedWorks&#13;
&#13;
Applicability: This procedure applies to community rehabilitation / construction works to be&#13;
identified and implemented by the communities themselves (for small projects o f up to $100,000&#13;
each).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                 111&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Overall approach: The communities should be responsible for making sure that the projects they&#13;
propose are not in mine-contaminated areas, or have been cleared by M A C A (or a mine action&#13;
organization accredited by MACA).&#13;
&#13;
Rationale: Communities are best placed to know about mined areas in their vicinity, and have a&#13;
strong incentive to report them accurately as they will carry out the works themselves.&#13;
&#13;
Procedure:&#13;
&#13;
1, Communities are required to submit a reply to a questionnaire regarding the suspected presence o f&#13;
mines in the area where Bank-funded community-managed projects will be implemented.                This&#13;
questionnaire should be formally endorsed by the Mine Action Programfor Afghanistan (MAPA). It&#13;
will be a mandatory attachment to the project submission by the communities and should be signed&#13;
by community representatives and the external project facilitator. External project facilitators will&#13;
receive training from MAPA. Financing agreements with the communities should make clear that&#13;
communities are solely liable incase o f a mine-related accident.&#13;
&#13;
2. If the community certifies that there i s no known mine contamination in the area, the ministry&#13;
responsible for the selection o f projects should check with M A C A whether any different observation&#13;
i s reportedon MACA's data base.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0   IfMACA's information is the same, the project can go ahead for selection. The community&#13;
         takes the full responsibility for the assessment, and external organizations cannot be made&#13;
         liable incase o f an accident.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0   IfMACA's informationis different, the project shouldnot go ahead for selection as long as&#13;
         MACA's and community's statements have not been reconciled.&#13;
&#13;
3, Ifthe community suspects mine contamination inthe area,&#13;
&#13;
      0  If the community has included an assessment / clearance task in the project agreed to be&#13;
         implemented by M A C A (or by a mine action organization accredited by MACA), the project&#13;
          can go ahead for selection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      0   Ifthe community has not included an assessment / clearance task inthe project, the project&#13;
          should not go ahead for selection as long as this has not been corrected.&#13;
&#13;
          Mine clearance tasks must be implemented by M A C A or by a mine action organization&#13;
          accredited by MACA. Communities will be penalized (subsequent funding by World-Bank&#13;
          funded projects shall be reduced or cancelled) if they elect to clear mines on their own.&#13;
&#13;
Procedure for Small and Medium-size Works Contracted Out&#13;
&#13;
Applicability: This procedure applies to small- and medium-size works to be identified by local&#13;
authorities and implementedby local contractors (for projects up to $5m each).&#13;
&#13;
Overall approach: M A C A (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) should provide&#13;
detailed information on the mine-related risks (either based on previously done and updated general&#13;
survey or on a new general survey) before projects are considered for selection. Only project sites&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    112&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
assessed to have a nil-to-low risk would be eligible for selection, unless they have been demined by&#13;
MACA or by a mine action organization accreditedby MACA.&#13;
&#13;
Rationale: Neither local authorities nor local contractors have the capacity to assess the mine-related&#13;
risks in a systematic way, while they may have incentives to underestimate them.&#13;
&#13;
Procedure:&#13;
&#13;
      1. Prior to puttingup a project for selection, a general survey should be carried out by MACA&#13;
         (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) to assess mine-related risks in the area&#13;
         o f the project (this should include checking information available inthe MACA data base).&#13;
&#13;
     2. IfMACA provides information suggesting a nil-to-low risk in the proposed project area, the&#13;
         project can go ahead for selection.&#13;
&#13;
     3.  The contract betweenthe responsible ministry and the contractor will include a clause stating&#13;
         that in case o f an accident, legal liability would be fully and solely borne by the contractor.&#13;
&#13;
     4.   IfMACAassessesapotentiallyhighriskinthearea(whetherduetothepresenceofmines&#13;
         or uncertainty),&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         0    If the project includes an assessment / clearance task agreed to be implemented by&#13;
              MACA (or by a mine action organization accredited by MACA), it can go ahead for&#13;
              selection based on agreed funding modalities (clearance may be funded either under a&#13;
              contract with a Bank-funded project or under existing donor agreements with the mine&#13;
              action organization);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         0    Ifthe project does not include an assessment/ clearance task, it shouldnot go ahead for&#13;
              selection as long as this has not been corrected.&#13;
&#13;
Procedure for Works to be implemented directly by Government DepartmentdAgencies,&#13;
without use o f contractors&#13;
&#13;
Applicability: This procedure applies to works to be implemented directly by Government&#13;
departmentdagencies, without use o f contractors.&#13;
&#13;
 Overall approach: MACA (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) should provide&#13;
detailed information on the mine-related risks (either based on previously done and updated general&#13;
 survey or on a new general survey) before works or installation o f goods/materials are carried out in&#13;
 any given area. Work would only be allowed to proceed in areas assessed to have a nil-to-low risk,&#13;
unless they have been demined by a mine action organization accredited by MACA .&#13;
&#13;
Rationale: Government departments and agencies responsible for providing services currently do not&#13;
have the capacity to assess the mine-relatedrisks in a systematic way, and currently follow a process&#13;
 o f consulting with MACA prior to carrying out activities.&#13;
&#13;
Procedure:&#13;
&#13;
 1. Prior to carrying out work, the Government department/agency will consult with MACA to assess&#13;
      mine-related risks in the area (this should include checking information available in the MACA&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     113&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   data base). If not already done, a general survey should be carried out by M A C A (or by a mine&#13;
   action organization accredited by MACA) to assess mine-related risks inthe area.&#13;
&#13;
2. If M A C A provides detailed information on mine-related risks which suggest a nil-to-low risk in&#13;
   the proposed area, the work can proceed. The Government would be solely liable in case o f a&#13;
   mine-related accident.&#13;
&#13;
3. IfinformationprovidedbyMACAcannotsupporttheassessmentofanil-to-lowriskinthe&#13;
   proposed area (whether due to the presence of mines or uncertainty), works should not go ahead&#13;
   before M A C A (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) carries out the necessary&#13;
   further assessment andor clearance for risks to be downgraded to nil-to-low, based on agreed&#13;
   funding modalities (clearance may be funded either under a contract with a Bank-funded project&#13;
   or under existing donor agreements with the mine action organization).&#13;
&#13;
Procedure for Large Works Using Contractors&#13;
&#13;
Applicability: This procedure applies to large works to be implemented by large contractors (projects&#13;
above $5m).&#13;
&#13;
Overall approach: The main contractor should be responsible for dealing with mine-related risks, in&#13;
coordination with the UNMine Action Center.&#13;
&#13;
Procedure:&#13;
&#13;
1. As part o f the preparation of the bidding documents, a general survey should be carried out by&#13;
   MACA (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA) on all the areas where contractors&#13;
   may have to work (broadly defined). This survey should provide detailed information on mine-&#13;
   related risks in the various areas allowing for an un-ambiguous identification o f areas that have a&#13;
   nil-to-low risk o f mine/UXO contamination and areas where the risk i s either higher or unknown.&#13;
   The survey should be financed out o fthe preparation costs o f the biddingdocuments.&#13;
&#13;
2. All survey information should be communicated to the bidders (with sufficient legal caveats so&#13;
   that it does not entail any liability), as information for the planning o f their activities (e.g.,&#13;
   location o f campsites, access roads to quarries).&#13;
&#13;
3. Depending on the nature and location o f the project and on the available risk assessment, two&#13;
    different options can be used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Option 1 Mine-clearance activities are part of the general contract&#13;
          -&#13;
&#13;
    a. Based on the general survey results, a specific budget provision for mine action during&#13;
    construction i s set aside as a separate provisional sum in the tender documents for the general&#13;
    contract.&#13;
&#13;
   b. As a separately identified item in their bid, the bidders include a provision for a further&#13;
    detailed mine assessment and clearance during constmction.&#13;
&#13;
    c. On the instruction o f the Supervision Engineer and drawing on the specific provisional sum&#13;
    for mine action inthe contract, the contractor uses one o f several nominated sub-contractors (or a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   114&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
   mine action organization accredited by MACA) to be rapidly available on call, to carry out&#13;
   assessment prior to initiation o f physical works in potentially contaminated areas, and to conduct&#13;
   clearance tasks as he finds may be needed.          The Contractor may also hire an international&#13;
   specialist to assist him in preparing and supervisingthese tasks. The Contractor i s free to choose&#13;
   which o f the accredited sub-contractors to use, and he i s fully responsible for the quality o f the&#13;
   works and i s solely liable incase of accident after an area has been demined.&#13;
&#13;
   d. To avoid an "over-use'' o f the budget provision, the Contractor i s required to inform the&#13;
   Supervision Engineer in writing (with a clear justification o f the works to be carried out) well in&#13;
   advance o f mobilizing the mine-clearing team. The Supervision Engineer has the capacity to&#13;
   object to such works.&#13;
&#13;
Option 2 - Mine-clearance activities are carried out under a separate contract&#13;
&#13;
   a.   Specific, separately-awarded contracts are issued for further surveying andlor clearing o f&#13;
   areas with a not-nil-to-low risk (under the supervision o f the Engineer)by specialized contractors&#13;
   (or a mine action organization accredited by MACA). The definition o f the areas to be further&#13;
   surveyed / cleared should be limited to those areas where any contractor would have to work, and&#13;
   should not include areas such as camp sites and quarrieslmaterial sites which are to be identified&#13;
   by the Contractor duringand after bidding o f the works. As a result of these further surveys and&#13;
   possibly clearance works, mine-related risk in the entire contract area i s downgraded to nil-to-&#13;
   low.&#13;
&#13;
   b. The contract with the general Contractor specifies the extent o fthe portion of the construction&#13;
   site o f which the Contractor i s to be given possession from time to time, clearly indicating&#13;
   restrictions o f access to areas where the mine risk i s not nil-to-low. It also indicates the target&#13;
   dates at which these areas will be accessible. Followingreceipt o f the notice to commence works&#13;
   from the Engineer, the Contractor can start work in all other areas.&#13;
&#13;
   c. The general Contractor i s invited to include in its bid an amount for mine-security, to cover&#13;
   any additional survey I clearance he may feel necessary to undertake the works.&#13;
&#13;
4. In case o f an accident, a Board o f Inquiry i s assembled by M A C A to investigate on the causes o f&#13;
   the accident and determine liabilities. Large penalties should be applied on the Contractor if the&#13;
   Board determines that the accident resulted from a breach o f safety rules.&#13;
&#13;
5. All parties involved in this process are required to closely coordinate with M A C A and to provide&#13;
   the Government, local communities, MACA, as well as any interested party the full available&#13;
    information on mine-related risks that may reasonably be required (e.g., maps o f identified&#13;
   minefields, assessments for specific areas).&#13;

&#13;
Main Objectives. The monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) system for the Horticulture and Livestock&#13;
Project (HLP) i s intended to provide information to the various stakeholders on project&#13;
implementation performance, process, outputs, and outcomes. The main purpose o f the monitoring&#13;
system i s to provide timely feedback to the Ministry o f Agriculture and Irrigation (MAI), IDA, and&#13;
other aid agencies on the progress o f the project developments so that lessons can be learned on a real&#13;
time basis and corrective actions initiatedwhere necessary. The M&amp;E system has four components:&#13;
(i)implementation monitoring - physical and financial; (ii)process monitoring, involving the&#13;
Implementation Management Support Team (IMST),                Facilitating Partners (FPs), and MA1&#13;
departments; (iii) post-implementation monitoring, including sustainability monitoring o f completed&#13;
sub-projects and audits; and (iv) outcome evaluation to assess impacts on livelihoods by yield&#13;
measurements and income assessments. A management information system (MIS) will ensure that&#13;
information flow takes place smoothly at all levels, and that data are electronically processed from&#13;
individual project through provincial MA1offices. Indices for M&amp;E activities would be based on the&#13;
data included inthe Results Matrix and Results Monitoring for the Project (Appendix 1).&#13;
&#13;
Organization for Monitoring and Evaluation will be the responsibility of the Monitoring and&#13;
Evaluation Department (MED) o f the Policy and Planning Department (PPD) o f MAL The M&amp;E&#13;
Specialist recruited as part o f the lead Facilitating Partner (FP) in the Implementation Management&#13;
Support Team (IMST) will be responsible for working with colleagues in MED to develop systems&#13;
that will ensure production o f practicable, timely and accurate information on the impact o f HLP and&#13;
other agricultural development projects.&#13;
&#13;
Physical GeograDhic Monitoring. The Landcover mapping to be financed under the HLP will&#13;
provide the following information on the national status o f agriculture and irrigation sectors and will&#13;
provide a basis for measuring achievements under HLP and, inparticular:&#13;
&#13;
    0   Detailed mapping o f agricultural land from, involving highresolution satellite imagery (SPOT&#13;
         5 - 2 meters) and trend analysis (1972/1993/2000/2006).&#13;
&#13;
    0   Detailed mapping o f rangeland classes and characterization o f vegetation dynamics focusing on&#13;
        rangeland classes over a 4-5 years timeframe and including: trend analysis o f rangeland&#13;
         encroachment (1993/2000/2006) with rainfed cultivation inwinter and summer pastureland and&#13;
         total dry matter estimates innatural pastures for rearing livestock.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   Baseline data on cultivated areas in designated project areas and similar adjacent non-project&#13;
         (control) areas, including trend analysis (1993/2000/2006) for: orchards, vineyards, field crops,&#13;
        vegetable gardens, and pistachio forest areas. The control areas would be double difference&#13;
        monitored withlwithout treatments provided to direct beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
    0    Output and outcome impact analysis o f key indices relating to horticulture and livestock&#13;
        production sub-components.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     116&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
    0   Records o f trends in numbers o f livestock prophylactic treatments, incidence o f endemic&#13;
        diseases, and numbers o f animals treated at VFUs.&#13;
&#13;
ImplementationMonitoring&#13;
&#13;
Project developments will be monitored in all operating locations, with farmers' associations&#13;
providing the basic unit for data and FPs organizing collection and collation. Physical information to&#13;
be monitored will relate to key production-oriented targets agreed inannual work programs and other&#13;
outputs (such as training). Financial information will provide details o f expenditures relative to the&#13;
work program budget.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    0   At field level:    Farmers groups will be requested to provide quarterly summaries o f&#13;
        production activities, as well as their organization and the usefulness o f services provided&#13;
        under HLP. The FPs will produce quarterly reports specifying the input, output, and outcome&#13;
        achievements o f project beneficiaries (farmers groups, traders, etc.), including details o f any&#13;
        problems encountered and remedial actions taken.         These data will be submitted in a&#13;
        comprehensive progress report to MED. Monitored data for aggregated reporting for the&#13;
        provincial level will be entered into a standardized MIS. The flow o f monitoring information&#13;
         and findings deriving from this information can be depicted as follows:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0  At the province level: Facilitating Partners (or MAI, where there i s more than one FP in the&#13;
         province) will input data from reports (including comments) to the MIS and generate simple,&#13;
         province reports, by district and farmers' group.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     0  At Ministry Headquarters level: The Monitoring and Evaluation Specialist form the lead FP&#13;
         will help the MED team to input data to the main MIS system, organize data analysis, and&#13;
         produce comparative province and district reports.&#13;
&#13;
ProcessMonitoring&#13;
&#13;
Process indicators are based on the measurable outputs agreed inthe annual work program o f each FP&#13;
and included intheir corresponding quarterly progress report. In addition, MAL'IMST will separately&#13;
conduct, on a sample basis, a bi-annual process monitoring exercise. This will involve the hiringo f&#13;
an external agency to spend significant time in the field to monitor key processes at the farmer group&#13;
level, inter-group and province comparisons, and suggest remedial action where required.&#13;
&#13;
Post-implementationMonitoring:&#13;
&#13;
The purpose i s primarily to determine whether farmers groups are operating as predicted inthe annual&#13;
work programs and achieving the predicted results. Post-implementationmonitoring will be carried&#13;
 out through random sample monitoring by PPD Monitoring Department at harvest time.&#13;
&#13;
 OutcomeEvaluation.&#13;
&#13;
 To assess whether the HLP i s meeting its objectives, key performance indicators have beendeveloped&#13;
 (Appendix 1). Achievements against these will be evaluated on a bi-annual basis by an external&#13;
 evaluation consultant. Inaddition, regular supervision, and a mid-term review will be conducted by&#13;
 IDA. At the end o f the project period, IDA will produce an Implementation Completion Report,&#13;
 which focuses on evaluating whether the project objectives and targets for keyperformance indicators&#13;
 have beenmet.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                      117&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Dissemination o f Information: The FP's quarterly progress reports derived from implementation&#13;
monitoring will cover the district(s) in which each FP i s operating and information from district and&#13;
provincial reports will be aggregated at the national level by MA1 Monitoring and Statistics&#13;
Departments (see reporting below). At the national level, quarterly progress reports for the project as&#13;
a whole will be shared with key stakeholders, including the Minister MAI, the Project Steering&#13;
Committee, FPs, and donor agencies. These reports will be used by the Director PPD to ensure that&#13;
lessons from ongoing projects are reflectedinthe design o fnew developments.&#13;
&#13;
Institutional arrangements for M&amp;E:       The M&amp;E system will be managed by MA1 Monitoring &amp;&#13;
Evaluation Department at the provincial and national levels with inputs from FPs.          While it is&#13;
expected that the MED staff at the provincial level will regularly visit farmers associations, it i s&#13;
important that senior personnel from IMST and the HLP Steering Committee should also go to the&#13;
field periodically, to obtain first-hand knowledge of project activities. IMST will also hold meetings&#13;
and workshops with FPs (at least quarterly) to share the results o f monitoring and receive feedback&#13;
and decide how to improve project operations. The monitoring system and the HLP Operational&#13;
Manual will thus be periodically updated and improved, making both live instruments for improving&#13;
project performance. At the same time, these lessons will be reflected in subsequent annual work&#13;
programs.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Present Situation&#13;
&#13;
Since 2002, considerable progress has been made in restoring and re-equipping buildings and&#13;
employing a cadre o f qualified Afghan returnees with extensive experience from working in other&#13;
countries. Operations o f MAI are currently supported by some thirty international advisers, mostly&#13;
funded from bi/multilateral institutions, who are policy and technical advisors to MAIdepartments or&#13;
to development projects (FAO, USAIDIRAMP, and EC). At the same time, under the umbrella o f&#13;
Government's Priority Reform and Restructuring (PRR) program, the structure for a modem&#13;
agricultural ministry is being debated and a systematic process adopted for personnel selection.&#13;
Similarly, a start has been made inre-establishing the University o f Kabul and other universities.&#13;
&#13;
Nonetheless, the Ministry has a major staffing dilemma, with an older group - that was active in&#13;
1970s and is now approaching retirement - and recent graduates - who lack practical experience. The&#13;
Ministry has initiated a broad based training program to further address this need. Between these&#13;
groups there is a dearth o f qualified or experienced personnel. Added to this, severe fiscal budget&#13;
constraints means that poor salary levels provide no incentive to staff at all levels. Lacking any&#13;
capability in modem agricultural technological and management skills, farmers regard the existing&#13;
agriculture support personnel as having little to offer for improving crop and livestock productivity,&#13;
and resolving agricultural problems. A voluntary redundancy scheme and staff selection would&#13;
enable MAT to provide incentives to qualifying staff.&#13;
&#13;
While the developments that have been achieved are fragile, they could provide a sound basis for a&#13;
modem, demand-driven agriculture ministry. The challenge will not be solved by reverting to the&#13;
procedures o f the 1970s. To realize the potentials for regaining traditional markets andbetter assuring&#13;
food security, i t is essential to develop modem technologies and management practices. However, in&#13;
the absence o f a coordinated development program, the dearth o f Afghans with practical field&#13;
experience o f modem agricultural production will continue for the foreseeable future. The staffing&#13;
dilemma can best be countered byjudicious contracting o f qualified technical assistance personnel to&#13;
work with qualifying staff and disseminate contemporary information to farming communities.&#13;
However, this must be inline with precise terms o freference and results related conditions.&#13;
&#13;
At the same time, there are encouraging examples at field level where various pilot projects with&#13;
NGO support are successfully selecting, training, and involving field personnel in extension&#13;
operations. However, their impact i s only sustainable when working with MAIpersonnel and when&#13;
continued finding i s assured. The approach taken by the initiators o f these operations is to announce&#13;
that they are intending to start operations in a specific location and, following evaluation and&#13;
selection; extensionists are trained and assigned to development activities.           These examples&#13;
demonstrate that - with support from qualified and committed technical assistance       - it i s possible&#13;
initiate effective extension operations.&#13;
&#13;
I t is essential that the Ministry's reorganization process be accompanied by an action plan for&#13;
rationalizing staff numbers. Under the PRR program, the management of MAI is requiredto reduce&#13;
by half the Ministry's staff numbers. It is hoped that this will happen early in 2006, on the basis of a&#13;
competitive and transparent selection process, thereby enabling the most competent people to be&#13;
retrained and assigned to specific jobs within the departments and provinces. I t will also mean that&#13;
the scarce budget resources available for MA1salaries can be allocated so as to provide better income&#13;
and incentive for the selected personnel. However, the rationalization process is being held in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    120&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
abeyance due to confusion over hiring o f several hundredadditional staff for the Ministry as well as&#13;
the submission o f a second organizational proposal (August 2005). Formal personnel recruitment&#13;
under PRR has therefore been limited to competitive selection o f higher level posts (grades 1 to 3)&#13;
and MAIdepartment heads have been selected together with some provincial directors.&#13;
&#13;
Clearly, urgent decision over the Ministry's structure and staffing will be critical for successful&#13;
institutional strengthening under HLP. Personnel from the technical departments were directly&#13;
involved in identifying and preparing the project proposals and discussions on the organization&#13;
continued during appraisal. A t the same time, the evolutionary process described above is fragile,&#13;
because o f the Government's extremely limited recurrent budget situation that primarily depends on&#13;
the international community.&#13;
&#13;
Project Organization&#13;
&#13;
Basic Principles o f Proiect Operation&#13;
&#13;
Project implementation will be founded on developing the technical and managerial skills o f Afghan&#13;
people, with the aim of establishing a strong basis for sustainable development. However, this will&#13;
not be achieved by reinstating personnel that were employed by the Ministry o f Agriculture in 1970s;&#13;
existing personnel will be evaluated to assess their competence for fulfilling project posts.&#13;
&#13;
In the first instance, production developments will be organized through strategic regional research&#13;
centers (North: Deh Dadi and Central: Qurgaha) and in liaison with MAI provincial offices&#13;
concerned. This will help to mitigate possible delays from relying on the large number o f districts in&#13;
the provinces to be touched by HLP. The personnel needs o f each sub-component o f HLP have been&#13;
defined on the basis of teams that include management, organization support and field staff.&#13;
Recruitment will be based on precise terms o f reference and the selection procedures for all posts.&#13;
Competent personnel that hlfillthese will be assigned for project implementation and provided with&#13;
training, facilities, and subsistence allowances. Project financing will not provide for `top-up' salary&#13;
payments, but field allowances will be payable for project-related operations. Selected personnel&#13;
would be able to gain a higher salary by resigning from MA1for a specified period during project&#13;
implementation under special arrangements with MOF. In order to counter the inherent weakness in&#13;
MA1staff, both at headquarters and inthe field, and to address the HLP's emergency objective, FPs&#13;
will be recruited to work with existing MAIpersonnel to support project implementation. Preference&#13;
will be given to qualifying individuals and organizations that have recent experience o f organizing&#13;
rural development in Afghanistan to lead the teams.&#13;
&#13;
Where existing MAI personnel in any location do not fblfill the specifications, FPs in conjunction&#13;
with the directors of the designated strategic research centers will recruit younger, proactive Afghans&#13;
who can comprehend the opportunities of modern, demand-driven agriculture strategies based on&#13;
farmers' needs and recognizing the role o f women producers. These people will be contracted for&#13;
specified periods during H L P implementation.     An important responsibility o f FPs working in each&#13;
sub-sector will be to develop training materials and an information system for project staff.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to ensuring the swiftest possible implementation of sound technical developments, FP&#13;
teams will fulfill the following key project objective by:&#13;
&#13;
 1. Contracting ineach designated strategic research center a lead regional FP to work as the regional&#13;
     team leader and the Head o f the Center will serve as deputy team leader;&#13;
&#13;
2. Providing specialist advice on agricultural technologies and management systems and on-the-job&#13;
     training by working with qualifying personnel inline positions inMAIdepartments involved with&#13;
     project implementation;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                    121&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3.  Working with Project personnel to organize demonstrations for potential beneficiaries and&#13;
    extension and management support for guiding the development o f sub-components;&#13;
&#13;
4. Developing MAI's policy analysis capacity by working with personnel o f the MAI Policy and&#13;
    Planning Department (PPD); and&#13;
&#13;
5. Developing procedures for monitoring the achievements of sub-components and analyzing&#13;
    reasons for any shortfall.&#13;
&#13;
Proiect Management&#13;
&#13;
The H L P will be executed by MA1 and the project activities will be integrated with the Ministry&#13;
departments and field operations. An Implementation Management Support Team (IMST) will be&#13;
established as the vehicle through which MAIcan most effectively manage, coordinate and supervise&#13;
H L P and could provide the framework through which MA1will manage horticulture and livestock&#13;
developments supported by other aid agencies.        The IMST will be part o f Policy and Planning&#13;
Department (PPD), which is responsible for managing the development budget. In order to develop&#13;
strong planning, administration, and management capacity in MAI as swiftly as possible,&#13;
responsibility for the I M S T will be outsourced to a lead FP with a proven record in implementing&#13;
similar developments to HLP.&#13;
&#13;
The IMST will be headed by a Manager (head o f the lead FP) who will be responsible to the General&#13;
Director o f PPD for overall Project implementation.         In addition, the Minister MAI has been&#13;
requested to appoint an experienced agriculturalist as Deputy General Director to work with the&#13;
Manager to ensure competent organization and supervision o f program developments after&#13;
completion o f HLP. The IMST will consist o f a small team o f professional specialists (planning,&#13;
accounting, procurement, monitoring and training) that will work alongside and strengthen the&#13;
capacities o f trained Afghan personnel working in PPD, as well as a horticulture and a livestock&#13;
specialist to be responsible for coordinating the respective project activities.&#13;
&#13;
Implementation of Technical Components&#13;
&#13;
Project developments will be organized through voluntary farmers' associations in agreed project&#13;
areas, Horticulture production activities will initially be restricted to Central and Northern Regions&#13;
and, if security permits, will be extended to Southern Region in PY2. Animal health developments&#13;
will operate in five regions, consolidating past developments, the pilot dairy unit will serve parts of&#13;
five provinces in Central Region and poultry production will operate in parts o f eight provinces,&#13;
extending past developments.&#13;
&#13;
Horticulture Developments&#13;
&#13;
a)       Horticulture Development Council o f Afghanistan (HDCA). For horticulture developments,&#13;
the existing Horticulture Steering Committee (HSC) will be the basis for establishing a HDCA. A&#13;
horticulture organization specialist FP, working alongside HSC, will have dual responsibility for&#13;
organizing the formation o f the Council and coordinating technical developments inthe field through&#13;
the strategic research stations at Deh Dadi in Balkh (Northern Region) and Kabul (Central Region),&#13;
for which implementationwill be responsibility o f separate FPs. Within three years, the HSC will&#13;
become the permanent Secretariat o f the Council.&#13;
&#13;
The FPs contracted to coordinate field production o f the horticulture sub-components will involve a&#13;
team o f technical and organizational specialists that will work through the strategic research centers&#13;
and in liaison with provincial MAI offices. These teams will work with farmers associations in&#13;
collaboration with community authorities (CDCs, Shuras, etc.) who will be responsible for informing&#13;
farmers about the project, encouraging women and men farmers to attend training, and verifying the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   122&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
location and extent o f beneficiaries' land holding. Field extension teams for each sub-component will&#13;
be formed first by testing existing MAI personnel in each location and, if there are insufficient&#13;
number that fulfill the terms o f reference, additional staff will be recruited from the locality.&#13;
&#13;
b)       Perennial Tree Crop Production. Trained farmers that agree to rehabilitate their existing&#13;
orchards will receive a simple package involving small tools and integrated pest management. Those&#13;
that agree to develop new orchards will receive packages o f inputs that will be grant aided on a&#13;
sliding scale.I2 The package for grape orchards will also include provisions for trellises.&#13;
Beneficiaries' contribution will include provision o f their land and other inputs, such as water,&#13;
manure, tools, labor, and the cost of any mechanization. In addition, farmers will be required to&#13;
contribute 5 to 10 percent in cash towards the total cost (level to be decided by the FPs and reflected&#13;
inthe Operational Manual). The precise arrangement for allocating grants will bejointly decided for&#13;
each farmers group involved by the community authority and FP concerned. These measures will&#13;
help to ensure the commitment of beneficiaries and access for all types o f farmers. If required,&#13;
communities would inform farmers about channels through which beneficiaries can obtain micro&#13;
credit (e.g. MISFA, which is supported by IDA).&#13;
&#13;
Animal Production&#13;
&#13;
To a large extent, the animal production sub-components will follow the procedures o f existing&#13;
operations that are being duplicated:&#13;
&#13;
a)        For animal health, the Afghanistan Veterinary Association (AVA) will be contracted as the FP,&#13;
working in team with the Dutch Committee for Afghanistan (DCA) and will continue to support the&#13;
development of professional veterinarians through veterinary field units (VFUs), including training and&#13;
the use o f equipment and vaccines. Short-term specialists will be contracted to advise on drafting&#13;
legislation.&#13;
&#13;
b)        Animal husbandry developments will involve recruiting specialists to work with MAI&#13;
personnel. They will be contracted to help adapt procedures in a range o f modern livestock production&#13;
 techniques to the needs of Afghan conditions and farmers' preferences (natural pastures, animal fibers,&#13;
 artificial insemination, fish and bee keeping)          - all as a basis for expansion under the longer-term&#13;
horticulture and livestock program.&#13;
&#13;
 c)       Dairy processing developments will involve a specialist FP to help develop procedures for&#13;
 developing milk collection centers with farmers' associations to serve a central processing unit. The FP&#13;
 will also assist with developing facilities for processing animal feed. This sub-component will be based&#13;
 on proven systems in India and elsewhere and is expected to expand to a nationwide network under the&#13;
 longer-term. A short-term specialist FP will be hired to develop proposals for a coordinating dairy&#13;
 development organization for Afghanistan.&#13;
&#13;
 d)       The poultry production sub-component will involve experienced FPs to extend the existing&#13;
 successful experience working with mostly women farmers to develop small-scale, semi-intensive egg&#13;
 and meat production units.&#13;
&#13;
 The primary roles o f FPs will be to:&#13;
&#13;
      0   In collaboration with MAIprovincial offices, prepare detailed annual work programs for their&#13;
          assigned tasks;&#13;
&#13;
      0   Collaborate with community authorities (e.g. CDCs where they exist) in their project area to&#13;
          develop and transfer information on project activities to farming communities and to identify&#13;
          suitable beneficiaries for project activities;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 l 2For example, the first jerib [0.25ha] could be free to all qualifying farmers. For 1 - 2jeribs farmers could pay&#13;
 25% of total cost.For 2 - 5 jeribs, they could pay 40%, for 5 - 10jeribs, 60% payment, for 10- 25 jeribs, 80%&#13;
 payment, andbeyond 25 jeribs, the full cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                 123&#13;

                                       TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
&#13;
Counter narcoticsstrategy&#13;
&#13;
Given the scale and nature o f the opium problem in Afghanistan it i s recognised that the illicit drugs&#13;
issue cannot be dealt with in isolation from the wider state building and development process. No&#13;
single project or program can address the myriad motivations and factors that influence opium poppy&#13;
cultivation. The elimination o f opium production will be dependent on the achievement o f broader&#13;
development goals, including establishing the institutions required for formal governance and&#13;
promoting civil society, strengthening social protection mechanisms, as well as encouraging licit on-&#13;
farm, off-farm and non-farm income opportunities.&#13;
&#13;
HLP and counter-narcotics&#13;
&#13;
The H L P objectives will contribute to strengthening and diversifying legal rural livelihoods (National&#13;
Priority Two o f the Afghan National Drug Control Strategy (2005)) by facilitating the move from&#13;
opium poppy cultivation to the production o f licit crops.&#13;
&#13;
The primary beneficiaries o f the HLP horticulture component are better off farmers with irrigated&#13;
land, although smaller farmers are expected to participate more strongly in the orchard rehabilitation&#13;
sub-component. Most project investments are proposed in areas close to Kabul where opium i s not&#13;
currently produced, but one major opium producing province - Balkh - is included.              Thus the&#13;
component as designed is likely to have relatively weak impacts in reducing opium production&#13;
directly. Indirect impacts could however be stronger, with employment for permanent and casual&#13;
labour created by both rehabilitation o f orchards and by expansion, and also by the proposed alfalfa&#13;
inter-crop. Where tree crops substitute for opium poppy, which i s assumed in the change model&#13;
implicit in the farm models, there could be potentially negative repercussions, as share cropping&#13;
opportunities, labour requirements and wage rates will diminish. There will be reduced access to land&#13;
for poorer farmers and the landless and less labour opportunities. Thus, there is a potential for the&#13;
land poor and landless to lose out from the loss o f opium poppy in terms o f access to land, to on and&#13;
o f f farm income and to credit. This could possibly prompt relocation o f cultivation to neighbouring&#13;
areas to cultivate opiumpoppy.&#13;
&#13;
The livestock component would have more direct and immediate positive impacts on the opium&#13;
economy. The dairv component, slated to be implemented in the Kabul area, would have little or no&#13;
impact on the opium economy, but effects could be considerable if and when the component is&#13;
replicated in peri-urban areas located close to poppy production. The poultry sub-component could&#13;
have potential impacts on the opium economy as it would benefit principally households in resource-&#13;
poor, densely populated areas, and the component could also help rural-urban migrants.               The&#13;
cashmere fiber sub-component could have impacts on the poorest households, improving returns to&#13;
livestock and artisanal family labour. The veterinarv sub-component would have diffuse but positive&#13;
impacts, as it will address the production systems o f poorer households, for whom livestock is a&#13;
coping strategy. Women are expected to be the major beneficiaries o f the livestock component as a&#13;
whole, and their voice will be important in moving household livelihood strategies towards licit&#13;
production choices.&#13;

&#13;
Guidelinesfor the implementation&#13;
&#13;
Select otium areas where possible: H L P could implement activities where possible in opium&#13;
producing or vulnerable areas (all components, particularly the livestock components).         The &amp;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     128&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
component could be quickly replicated within the Program in other peri-urban areas more sensitive to&#13;
opium (for example, Jalalabad, Mazar, Qandahar...). The poultry component could be started up in:&#13;
Balkh, Chemtal, and Dihadi districts in Balkh province, Panjwai and Arghandab districts in Qandahar&#13;
province and Rodat, Kama, Surkhrud and Chapahar districts in Nangarhar. The cashmere fiber&#13;
subcomponent could target areas o f particular poverty where labor for opium may originate, such as&#13;
the Spinghar piedmont inNangarhar.&#13;
&#13;
Give prioritv to the uovertv reducing components: as the principal target groups for opium-reducing&#13;
actions are the poorer farmers and landless, more emphasis could be given to components addressing&#13;
the production systems o f the poor. The livestock components are the most appropriate here (dairy,&#13;
poultry, cashmere, and veterinary). Given the risk o f migration o f poorer farmers and labourers in&#13;
search o f opium sharecropping andjob opportunities elsewhere, there i s a logic to giving priority to&#13;
implementing these components in Balkh and any other opium producing area where the horticulture&#13;
component is implemented, so that the poorer farmers and labourers faced with diminished access to&#13;
the means o f production and to jobs will have some "stay-in-place alternatives".    Ways to increase&#13;
interventions specifically targeted at the land poor and landless should be considered - links with&#13;
labour intensive agro processing, vocational training, or improving access to agricultural inputs for&#13;
the rural poor so they can obtain a better sharecropping agreement. Clearly, much o f this lies outside&#13;
the present scope o f HLP: therefore, efforts should also be made to provide further economic&#13;
alternatives locally through partnerships and synergies with other programs (see next two&#13;
recommendations).&#13;
&#13;
Form a partnership with MISFA for more rapid scaling up: HLP development models are based on&#13;
careful implementation o f technical models and considerable use o f grant financing to start activities.&#13;
A partnership with financing agencies, particularly with MISFA, could help scale up activities in&#13;
dairy, poultry, and cashmere fiber quickly. A constraint for micro-finance institutions is that they are&#13;
not equipped to conduct skills training for farmers: a partnership between HLP and MISFA could&#13;
create complementarity, with HLP providing the technical input and MISFA institutions driving the&#13;
financial appraisal and credit. This approach would help scale up the components that address the&#13;
poorer farmers, more vulnerable to the opium economy, more quickly.&#13;
&#13;
Improve synergies by networking, coordination and ioint programming and by linkinginto the extent&#13;
possible with CDCs: HLP will join a number o f other National Priority Programs in providing&#13;
services to farmers that are "vertical" intheir delivery mechanism. Development impact - and hence&#13;
the counter-narcotic impact - will be considerably enhanced if these programs can be: (a) more&#13;
demand driven; and (b) more coordinated in their response. The model developed in the project&#13;
document is well conceived: involvement o f the CDCs at the base, and coordination between National&#13;
Programs at a higher level. H L P needs to be linkedto other programmes inthe area particularly those&#13;
targeting poorer farmers by extending the provision o f credit, agricultural services, and vocational&#13;
training. The specific potential for developing inter-linkages with these programmes in each HLP&#13;
area though CDC's and at higher levels (CDC clusters, District, Province) will need to be identified.&#13;
Inareas where opium poppy is being cultivated and the proposed sub project is being implemented in&#13;
isolation from other sectoral interventions, follow up action with relevant line ministries and district&#13;
and provincial development councils is recommended. It is recommended that it be an explicit&#13;
objective and activity in the TORSo f the IMST to identify the scope for these synergies and to work&#13;
on developing the mechanisms for operationalizing them. Within the World Bank, there could be an&#13;
explicit mandate to work up these synergies at every level.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring and evaluation to: (1) track movement from licit to illicit livelihoods; and (2) create&#13;
incentives bv setting indicators: monitoring and evaluation i s included in project design, but needs to&#13;
be expanded to track movement from licit to illicit livelihoods, informing both project management&#13;
and the national counter-narcotics program. An Opium Poppy Impact Assessment i s recommended,&#13;
with an analysis o f (i) extent o f opium poppy cultivation in the area inwhich the project is being&#13;
                       the&#13;
implemented, (ii) different socio-economic groups involved in opium poppy cultivation in the&#13;
                   the&#13;
area, (iii)how these groups will benefit and lose from HLP, and (iv) what their likely responses will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                     129&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
be. In addition, the monitoring and evaluation system should create incentives for MA1and for the&#13;
I M S T and the FPs by setting indicators.&#13;
&#13;
Guidelinesfor a broader "program approach"&#13;
&#13;
Operationalize the program approach: H L P is intended as the first step in MAI's long-term program&#13;
for horticulture and livestock development, so good ideas on modifications that would enhance the&#13;
counter-narcotic impact but cannot be incorporated in the H L P could be included in the wider&#13;
program, and could be picked up relatively quickly e.g. by DfID financing. MAI's Policy and&#13;
Planning Department will need support to manage a program framework and seek cofinancing, and&#13;
this support should be an explicit objective and activity in the TORSo f the IMST. A program&#13;
document could be prepared independent o f the project documents, as a basis for seeking co-&#13;
financing and for tracking progress towards the targets o f the 2005 Agriculture Master Plan.&#13;
&#13;
Bringforwardsupport to annual vegetables for earlier financing: annual vegetable production systems&#13;
do "mimic" the attractions o f the opium economy closely, particularly for smaller and poorer farmers&#13;
and labourers, providing: (i)    access to inputs and credit for a profitable ready cash market; (ii)     the&#13;
possibility o f access to land through share cropping; (iii)      access to risk management instruments&#13;
through contracts,       forward purchases, agro-industrial       supply; and (iv) remunerative labor&#13;
 opportunities. Several pilot projects have tested out models o f market-driven support (USAID ALP,&#13;
 RAMP, PAL). The proposed support through the H D C A to the development of the annual vegetable&#13;
 business could be brought forward for early financing and implementation, possibly by other donors&#13;
 under the broader program. Linkages to credit through MISFA would be key to rapid scaling up.&#13;
&#13;
 Develop and include a livestock fattening component for early scaling up: sheep fattening is a typical&#13;
 enterprise o f poorer farmers, and as such an activity that could present a real livelihood alternative&#13;
 choice. There i s currently a tendency for areas o f poppy concentration to have limited livestock: there&#13;
 i s a cycle o f less wheat straw due to high levels o f poppy cultivation, resulting in the need to purchase&#13;
 straw in some years when cropping patterns are high poppyllow wheat - which makes livestock too&#13;
 expensive to keep. In these areas, a livestock fattening program could help to shift the balance o f&#13;
 returns, particularly ifbreedingand fattening credit can increase, using livestock as a guarantee and if&#13;
  credit on opium continues to dry up as at present. This could prompt some shift to fodder crops and&#13;
  livestock, and reductions in poppy. Sheep fattening thus plays a key role in diversification, reducing&#13;
  the risk and increasing the return from the licit economy.          A combination o f technical advice,&#13;
  veterinary services and credit is required.&#13;
&#13;
  Propose components of the HLP program for CNTF financing at the 2006 London Conference, a&#13;
  total o f $80 million was pledged to the CNTF by a range o f donors. Although CNTF has yet to&#13;
  approve any projects, its criteria give priority to projects in opium producing or vulnerable areas, and&#13;
  to projects which support the "mainstreaming" o f counter narcotics objectives within institutions and&#13;
.programs.       HLP, as a national priority program from a leading line ministry and meeting the&#13;
  eligibility criteria, could well be a candidate for CNTF financing. There are several advantages to&#13;
  seeking CNTF financing for the program: (1) it can provide extra resources for a program that i s&#13;
  under-funded and which could prove very costly when it i s scaled up; (2) CNTF provides&#13;
  consolidated cofinancing, so that MAI would not have to deal with multiple donors; (3) CNTF is&#13;
  under national budget management, so that public budget management concerns would be allayed; (4)&#13;
  H L P gives a signal practical and concrete example o f "mainstreaming", and if i t were "cofinanced"&#13;
  by CNTF it could be a flagship which would have both demonstration effect for the world at large&#13;
  and institutional development impacts for mainstreaming capacity and practice in both MAI and&#13;
  MCN; and (5) financing a major national program like H L P would help build CNTF and its&#13;
  procedures and help CNTF to focus on mainstream programs with broad impact rather than on the&#13;
  kindofmyriadmicro-projects considered up to now.&#13;

            Afghanistan - Emergency Horticulture and
            Livestock Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Emergency Horticulture and Livestock
            Project aims to stimulate marketable output of perennial
            horticulture and livestock in focus areas by a) improving
            the incentives framework for private investments; and, b)
            strengthening institutional capacity in agriculture. The
            project will have a positive impact on broad-based economic
            growth in focus rural areas, by increasing the demand for
            output from the rural non-farm sector and from multipliers
            in farmers' expenditure. On the institution front,
            project support for the restructuring of the Ministry of
            Agriculture and Irrigation (MAI) will help develop the basis
            for a strong policy, regulatory, and support framework for
            the agriculture sector. Overall, these benefits will
            contribute to the Bank's rural poverty reduction goals
            and to implementation of the alternative livelihoods
            program. They will also provide a key element of a
            counter-narcotics strategy, by fostering an alternative to
            poppies, and by stimulating rural incomes through support to
            small-scale farmers, and through expansion of the rural
            non-farm sector.
