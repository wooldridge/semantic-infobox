                                              Abstract&#13;
&#13;
Water utilities in Africa find it increasingly difficult to provide adequate services to the needy&#13;
areas: their core business operations are often stagnant, compounded by a dramatic rise in peri-&#13;
urban and poor settlements. To address these challenges, the Water and Sanitation Program Africa&#13;
has designed a work program to disseminate the best practice in pro-poor service development&#13;
and to help utilities and municipal authorities to develop roadmaps to the MDGs for their service&#13;
areas. Activities will primarily be directed at: (i) helping utilities and municipal authorities to&#13;
include pro-poor objectives in their reform; and, (ii) working jointly with local partners, CBOs and&#13;
NGOs, and SSPs to develop strategies and actions specifically targeting informal settlements.&#13;
WSP-AF will focus on utilities that are engaged in reform or planning to do so. This program&#13;
builds on support developed for Water Utility Partnership (WUP#5).&#13;
&#13;
Key entry points for pro-poor strategies: (i) Pro-poor tariffs and financing mechanisms for service&#13;
improvement, (ii) Institutional arrangements to improve services to the urban poor, (iii) Pro-poor&#13;
transaction design (including regulation and monitoring), (iv) Advocacy and communications&#13;
regarding the urban poor, and (v) Consumer voice and civil society engagement.&#13;

1   The Context in Africa: Water and Sanitation Utilities are Failing the Urban Poor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.1  Urban Populations are Expanding Rapidly&#13;
&#13;
By 2015, urbanization in Sub-Saharan Africa will have progressed from about 32% today to about&#13;
45%. The urban population will have grown from the current level of about 215 million to about&#13;
400 million. If current trends prevail, the large majority of these urban dwellers will be living in&#13;
poverty in unplanned or informal settlements without access to safe water and hygienic&#13;
sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                         1&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.2     Water and Sanitation Utilities are Weak&#13;
&#13;
Existing water services in many African cities and towns are characterized by intermittent&#13;
supplies, frequent breakdowns, inefficient operations, poor maintenance, and depleted finance.&#13;
Political interference and low tariff policies have led to inefficiency and chronic financial weakness&#13;
of public utilities1. The inability of water and sanitation utilities to maintain and extend services&#13;
has typically led to situations where subsidized services are in fact reserved to those privileged to&#13;
have a network connection, while most of the poor have to rely on more costly and lower- quality&#13;
alternatives. Many governments across Africa have recognized the necessity of structural reforms&#13;
to break out from the cycle of poor services, lagging collection, weak finances, inadequate&#13;
maintenance, deteriorating assets, and lagging coverage.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   Low revenues                            Weak finances&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Customer dissatisfaction                     Deterioration of assets&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    Poor services                    Neglect of maintenance&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                                    Figure 1: The stagnation cycle of WSS utilities in Africa&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Institutional and policy reform are needed to break this stagnation cycle, by improving financial&#13;
and technical performance. These reforms have brought the issue of services to the poor into&#13;
sharp focus. In many cases this is due to the perception by many that the poor can only be&#13;
properly served by the public sector, while reforms are often based on public-private-partnerships&#13;
(PPP). There is now a clear realization that the political sustainability of reforms will depend on&#13;
the success of reforming utilities in improving and extending services to low-income areas. The&#13;
issue is how to create incentives for urban utilities both to perform better and simultaneously to&#13;
draw poor and informally settled households into the consumer base.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.3     The Millennium Development Goals are at Risk&#13;
&#13;
There is now a global consensus that lack of access to water and sanitation should be at the center&#13;
of the fight against poverty. The Millennium Development Goals for Water Supply and Sanitation&#13;
(WSS MDGs), adopted by the Millennium Summit and the World Summit, seek to halve the&#13;
proportion of people without sustainable access to safe drinking water by 2015 and without access&#13;
to basic sanitation by 2020.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Africa has the lowest water supply and sanitation coverage of any region in the world. More than&#13;
one in three Africans does not have access to improved water supply or to sanitation facilities.&#13;
&#13;
1Here public utilities are taken to mean any public entity (either government department, municipal department, water company whose main shareholding is either&#13;
in government hands or local authority) charged with providing water supply and/or sanitation services to urban areas including informal settlements&#13;
                                                                    2&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Today two-thirds of Africa's 625 million people live in rural areas, and one-third live in towns and&#13;
urban centers. Forty percent of those living in rural areas and eighty percent of those living in&#13;
urban centers have some access to safe water, but sustainability is not assured.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
It is in Africa that the WSS MDGs raise the most difficult challenges. In order to achieve the&#13;
MDGs, the number of people served with safe drinking water will need to double. An estimated&#13;
350 million more people, half rural and half urban, will need to be served by 2015. It is estimated&#13;
that the investment required to achieve the 2015 MDG for water is at least $20 billion ($1.5 billion&#13;
per year). Sanitation would cost at least another $10 billion. Therefore, the MDGS have given&#13;
added urgency to the challenge of developing water supply and sanitation services for rapidly&#13;
expanding informal and peri-urban settlements in African cities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.4   The Urban Poor are a Key Strategic Challenge for Water Utilities&#13;
&#13;
Over the next two decades, the bulk of population growth in developing countries will be&#13;
concentrated in urban areas. By 2020, 50 percent of the developing world's population will be&#13;
urban, most will live in small and medium-sized towns, and many will be low-income&#13;
households.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
African informal settlements currently account for an estimated 50 to 60% of the urban population.&#13;
Lack of clear policies and effective programs for meeting the needs of the poor has resulted in the&#13;
rapid expansion and densification of the slum areas where many residents live in absolute&#13;
poverty. Poverty in the slums is manifested in many forms, which include not only the lack of&#13;
subsistence income, but also lack of access to economic opportunities, to housing, land, education,&#13;
health services, water and sanitation services, and to safe unpolluted environment. According to&#13;
the statistics mentioned above and under the current trends, by 2015, those conditions would&#13;
apply to 200 to 240 million people in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Providing effective WSS to informal settlements has a number of critical challenges, among them:&#13;
(i) fears of low cost-recovery, jeopardizing plans for investment, operations and maintenance, (ii)&#13;
itinerant populations - a high proportion of poor households are tenants and migrant dwellers (in&#13;
some cases, rental periods do not exceed 3 months), (iii) uncontrolled development, congestion,&#13;
ramshackled housing and absentee landlords - physical constraints present a technical challenge&#13;
for service delivery, (iv) difficulty of employing conventional management arrangements in the&#13;
delivery of WSS services due to social, economic and technical characteristics, and (v) possible&#13;
risks due to the uncertainty of land tenure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
If coverage targets are to be met by year 2015, the vast majority of new clients for utilities will be&#13;
the poor. Experience from a number countries shows that it is possible to significantly improve&#13;
services to low-income urban areas through innovation in management and financing&#13;
mechanisms, and by building on community and private sector initiatives. However, many&#13;
utilities do not know how to do this, and do not understand the pitfalls and obstacles.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Low-income households who are connected to the main utility may struggle with tariff structures&#13;
which do not benefit them, have difficulty in paying bills if they are delivered sporadically and&#13;
&#13;
                                          3&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
infrequently, experience inconvenient and time-consuming payment arrangements, and suffer&#13;
from low priority for repairs and maintenance. The unconnected poor face even more problems.&#13;
These people often live in informal settlements where the main utility does not operate, forcing&#13;
them to rely on Small Scale Providers (SSPs) of water and sanitation services. SSPs include small-&#13;
scale private sector service providers (private water kiosks, water vendors, private borehole&#13;
operators, water tankers, and latrine pit exhausters), non-governmental organizations (NGOs),&#13;
and community based organizations (CBOs). These forms of services delivery take place in the&#13;
context of a variety of legal and institutionalization frameworks, which are often inadequate or&#13;
even hostile.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Water supply and sanitation services delivery to the urban poor is thus a key strategic challenge&#13;
for African utilities. Extending basic services to the urban poor has been considered a peripheral&#13;
issue for utilities, now it is increasingly recognized as a strategic goal by planners and policy&#13;
makers. It is also seen as key to the long-term survival of utilities confronted with the prospect of&#13;
playing a more marginal role in sprawling and dysfunctional cities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Reaching the poor requires targeted interventions and broader actions at the municipal level,&#13;
including: offering households a menu of service options, with differentiated costs that reflect&#13;
their willingness to pay; establishing appropriate tariffs and subsidies; expanding the choice of&#13;
service providers; and increasing hygiene awareness through social marketing as a means to&#13;
improving health and sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2   Looking Ahead: Main Elements of a Utility Pro-Poor Strategy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.1  What are the challenges faced by the utilities, and what do they need?&#13;
&#13;
Work is underway in more than 35 African countries promoting institutional and policy reform&#13;
aiming to break the cycle of inefficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Kampala Statement, published in February 2001 during the WUP conference in Kampala, and&#13;
endorsed by 317 delegates from 38 African countries, including six ministers, captured this well:&#13;
"a well-performing and financially sound utility is an absolute necessity, but an insufficient&#13;
condition for serving the urban poor".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Five key entry points for a pro-poor urban water and sanitation service strategy are:&#13;
1. Designing tariffs and subsidies to make them benefit the poor and developing mechanisms for&#13;
financing service improvements for the urban poor. In many cases subsidies intended for the poor&#13;
do not reach them, and existing tariff structures benefit the connected (more likely to be rich) and&#13;
small-volume consumers. Sustainable financing mechanisms are needed to ensure that adequate&#13;
funding is in place to meet coverage expansion requirements&#13;
2. Analyzing the existing situation and designing institutional arrangements to improve services&#13;
to the urban poor. Many utilities lack data on the poor, and a basic understanding of the&#13;
challenges they face. In addition, current situation lacks formal links between the utility and the&#13;
various providers of services to the poor. This, combined with land tenure issue and the informal&#13;
and unplanned nature of many settlements, often put the poor at a serious disadvantage. African&#13;
&#13;
                                         4&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
utilities should develop partnerships with NGOs, CBOs, SSPs and municipal agencies to go to&#13;
scale at reaching the poor.&#13;
3. Designing transactions for new private sector arrangements (including regulation and&#13;
monitoring) in such a way that the poor benefit&#13;
4. Designing advocacy and communications with respect to the urban poor - ensuring that&#13;
utilities' plans, programs and results are properly communicated, that the case for making&#13;
provisions to meet the needs of the poor is made clearly and convincingly, and that two-way&#13;
communication with the urban poor audience is optimized&#13;
5. Engaging consumers in water and sanitation reform and developing exchanges with civil&#13;
society. Those organizations are often vocal opponents of reform, but also committed advocates&#13;
for the poor. Engagement with consumers association will ensure that consumers' voice is heard&#13;
in planning reforms, their satisfaction is monitored on an on-going basis, and their concerns and&#13;
priorities addressed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.2   Proposed Action Plan&#13;
&#13;
Based on the above, a series of activities has been designed to address the current gaps in the&#13;
knowledge base, and to provide concrete models and tools for utilities seeking to address the&#13;
challenge of the urban poor. These activities will be the core of WSP-AF's urban work plan for the&#13;
next three years. The objective of the program is to improve water supply and sanitation service&#13;
delivery for the urban poor, by assisting our clients and partners to address the five major issues&#13;
described above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.2.1 Sustainable Financing Mechanisms and Pro-Poor Tariffs&#13;
The cross-subsidy principle is a powerful tool to promote household connections and access to&#13;
sanitation for low- and middle-income families.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In 1985, the municipality of Ouagadougou and ONEA (an autonomous public utility) introduced a&#13;
sustainable financing arrangement for on-site sanitation, through a surcharge or levy, added to the&#13;
water bill. By 1999, a total of CFA350 million (US$0.5 million) had been collected, 20,000 sanitary&#13;
facilities developed, and 206 artisans have been trained.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The Water Development Fund (FDE) implemented in Cote D'Ivoire in 1987 (during the concession&#13;
control negotiations), is supervised by a government body, not by SODECI (Société de&#13;
Distribution d'Eau de Cote d'Ivoire) itself. It makes capital available to SODECI for the financing&#13;
of the subsidized connections. It is funded from a surtax paid by the customers, and thus&#13;
constitutes a cross-subsidy between current customers and new customers. Following this policy,&#13;
Abidjan has attained the highest connection rate in sub-Saharan Africa (other than South Africa):&#13;
10 household connections per 100 inhabitants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Such consistent and massive financial flows from one category of customers to another have few&#13;
equivalents in Africa, and we propose to analyze and document the few African success stories in&#13;
financing WSS services development for the urban poor, and to develop guidelines to assist&#13;
utilities implementing such financing mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
                                          5&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Regarding tariffs, in December 2002 the Water and Sanitation Program and the World Bank&#13;
published two papers entitled "A Scorecard for India" and "Tariffs and Subsidies in Six Asian&#13;
Cities ­ do they target subsidies well?". Both these papers pointed out major flaws in the current&#13;
tariff structures ­ in particular that current tariffs did not come close to achieving cost recovery,&#13;
leading to financial instability of the utilities, and that subsidies were poorly targeted and did not&#13;
necessarily reach the poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Using the framework established in these two papers, it is proposed to collect data from a number&#13;
of African cities or national utilities ­ ideally about six, in order to analyze tariff and subsidy&#13;
structures and examine both their impact on the poor, and their impact on the financial&#13;
sustainability of the utilities. The analysis would allow conclusions to be drawn regarding the&#13;
viability of current tariff-setting practices, and recommendations to be made for change, as tariff&#13;
reform is often part of overall current water sector reform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.2.2 Situation Surveys and Interfacing SSPs with the Utility&#13;
To establish an institutional framework and financing mechanisms that rely on households, small&#13;
scale local private operators, and communities resources for improved neighborhood services and&#13;
facilities, an assessment of the existing situation of WSS services in informal settlements is needed,&#13;
including identification of management arrangements for improving service delivery and the key&#13;
policy and implementation issues that need to be addressed. Such assessments would enable the&#13;
utility to prepare the tender documents for the extension of water services and on-site sanitation&#13;
in non-connected areas, involving small-scale private operators, NGO's and community based&#13;
organizations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Through analyzing utilities in 4 or 5 countries,WSP-AF proposes to develop standard contracts&#13;
with SSPs to assist utilities in preparing the ground, and to initiate strategies and action plans to&#13;
develop services in un-served areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.2.3 Transaction Analysis and Advice&#13;
A great deal has been written on how transactions can be designed to be pro-poor, but in fact there&#13;
is little documentation of actual experience, either in places where PPPs have been in place for any&#13;
length of time (e.g. Dakar, Abidjan, Kampala, Johannesburg and Maputo), or of new transactions&#13;
(Dar Es Salaam). It is proposed to carry out a comparative study of the poverty outcomes of&#13;
planned or existing PPPs in a selection of these cities, to see how the type of contract, its content&#13;
and it legal and policy environment affect pro-poor outcomes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The methodology used for this analysis will be interviews with key stakeholders (government&#13;
agencies, the utlitiy, the regulator, consumers, civil society organizations) regarding their&#13;
perspectives of the outcomes of the reform, and an examination of the relevant documentation&#13;
(legislation, contracts, reports).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                           6&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Based on the findings of this study, on-going advice would be provided to other utilities&#13;
considering PPP arrangements, such as Kampala and Nairobi.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.2.4 Advocacy and Communications&#13;
In terms of advocacy, there is a range of stakeholders regionally and in each country that need to&#13;
be convinced about the value of specific programs aimed at the urban poor. In many instances, a&#13;
strong case for the benefits needs to be built and convincingly communicated. Based on case&#13;
studies in Africa, guidelines would be produced for both governments and utilities on how to&#13;
advocate for reforms that benefit the urban poor.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In terms of communicating effectively with urban poor, guidelines need to be developed on how&#13;
best to communicate with the urban poor audience for both shorter term reform issues and the&#13;
longer term behavior change required for payment for services, protection of water sources and&#13;
sanitation and hygiene.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Strategic communication programs with specific consideration for the urban poor are required for&#13;
successful urban reform. Whilst there is a growing number of development related reform&#13;
communication programs worldwide to learn from, there are few for the water and sanitation&#13;
sector. There has been some experience in countries such as Ghana and South Africa, and the first&#13;
two research-based, comprehensive WSS Reform Communication Strategies are now being&#13;
produced in Kenya and Uganda with WSP-AF support.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We propose to review these case studies for examples of best practice, and to develop practical&#13;
guidelines for utilities and governments can use on how to communicate with a range of&#13;
stakeholders on the benefits of reform, particularly for the poor, and how to communicate with&#13;
the urban poor themselves.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.2.5 Consumer Voice and Engagement with Civil Society&#13;
Representation by urban poor consumers is absent in virtually every water utility. Previous work&#13;
found that consumer associations show some potential to help speed up reform, but lack basic&#13;
understanding of issues, and face many specific constraints. There is a need to assist these&#13;
associations in a range of countries to engage with consumers themselves, and become an effective&#13;
voice in urban water reform.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Civil society stakeholders are often the opinion-leaders that influence public/ consumer views, and&#13;
are also often effective channels to reach the urban poor. In many areas, they are trusted by&#13;
communities as sources of information, and have networks of influence that go beyond the reach&#13;
of mass media vehicles such as newspapers and radio. As both `influencers' and channels for&#13;
communication, they are an important target audience for governments and utilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We propose NGOs and consumer organizations to be supported to lead the development and&#13;
implementation of a strategy and action plan to carry out direct consumer engagement in water&#13;
and/or sanitation service improvement at local city level. In addition, support for regional&#13;
organizations is required to provide country/regional support services to local organizations, such&#13;
&#13;
                                         7&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
as training, monitoring, coordination and organization of regional level activities, and to&#13;
undertake global dissemination of project experience.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
A two-way, interactive communication is required to improve the relationship between WSS&#13;
authorities and civil society stakeholders, including establishing ongoing public participation&#13;
mechanisms such as the `Forums' model developed by Rand Water in South Africa in the late&#13;
1990s. Forums were established with several different stakeholder groups to act as information&#13;
sharing and relationship building platforms to achieve win-win outcomes for common problem&#13;
areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The development of guidelines on how best to engage with civil society, based on a range of&#13;
different development examples where organizations have partnered with civil society&#13;
successfully and sustainably is needed by utilities and local governments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3   Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Many experiences and pilot studies have been conducted in the recent past by the utilities in&#13;
Africa, but experience remains piecemeal. If the MDGs are to be met, there is a urgent need now to&#13;
take pro-poor utility practice to scale. Utilities are critical for WSS service provision in urban&#13;
Africa and service to the poor must become a central component of their business strategy.&#13;
&#13;
Five entry points for a pro-poor strategy: (i) Pro-poor tariffs and financing mechanisms for service&#13;
improvement, (ii) Institutional arrangements to improve services to the urban poor, (iii) Pro-poor&#13;
transaction design, (iv) Advocacy and communications regarding the urban poor, and (v)&#13;
Consumer voice and civil society engagement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Taking pro-poor utility practice to scale also requires broadening the partnership for utility pro-&#13;
poor support in Africa. Each utility will need to expand its partnerships while WUP provides an&#13;
excellent vehicle for exchanging experience on best practice.&#13;
&#13;

            Pro-poor strategies for urban water supply
            and sanitation services delivery in Africa
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Water utilities in Africa find it
            increasingly difficult to provide adequate services to the
            needy areas: their core business operations are often
            stagnant, compounded by a dramatic rise in peri-urban and
            poor settlements. To address these challenges, the Water and
            Sanitation Program Africa (WSP-AF) has designed a work
            program to disseminate the best practice in pro-poor service
            development and to help utilities and municipal authorities
            to develop roadmaps to the Millennium Development Goals
            (MDGs) for their service areas. Activities will primarily be
            directed at: (i) helping utilities and municipal authorities
            to include pro-poor objectives in their reform; and, (ii)
            working jointly with local partners, Community Based
            Organizations (CBOs), Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs),
            and Small Scale Providers (SSPs) to develop strategies and
            actions specifically targeting informal settlements. WSP-AF
            will focus on utilities that are engaged in reform or
            planning to do so. Key entry points for pro-poor strategies
            include: (i) pro-poor tariffs and financing mechanisms for
            service improvement; (ii) institutional arrangements to
            improve services to the urban poor; (iii) pro-poor
            transaction design (including regulation and monitoring);
            (iv) advocacy and communications regarding the urban poor;
            and (v) consumer voice and civil society engagement.
