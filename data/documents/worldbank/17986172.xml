ZIEGLER: Today is August 26, 1986. My name is Charles Ziegler and I'm at the home of Mr.&#13;
&#13;
Stanley Please in Oxford, England. We will be conducting interview for the Oral History&#13;
&#13;
Program at the World Bank. Mr. Please, you came to the Bank first as a fiscal economist.&#13;
&#13;
Would you care to describe some of the work that you did and some of the Bank's work in that&#13;
&#13;
field when you first arrived?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PLEASE: Yes, thank you. I joined the Bank as a fiscal economist in 1963 from university life in&#13;
&#13;
England. Almost immediately I was made division chief, first on an acting basis and then&#13;
&#13;
permanently, in the old Economics Department of the 1960s. I was in charge of fiscal work and&#13;
&#13;
work on domestic financial mobilization more generally--in other words, fmancial policy and&#13;
&#13;
fmancial institutions for development. At that time the division consisted of about five or six&#13;
&#13;
people; they were primarily engaged in supporting country economic work. In my case, for&#13;
&#13;
instance, within a year I was sent with my family to India for six months or so to work as the fiscal&#13;
&#13;
economist with the Bell Mission on India.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But in addition to supporting country economic work, some major pieces of research were&#13;
&#13;
undertaken. I'd like to mention in particular the work of Marinos van der Mel, who remained at&#13;
&#13;
the Bank for many years, and [Sylvain R. F.] Plaaschaert who was with the Bank for about 10&#13;
&#13;
years, I believe, but returned to Belgium as professor. They worked on tax effort in developing&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                             - 2-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE]&#13;
&#13;
countries, which was a pioneering study and which was built upon by many researchers in the&#13;
&#13;
subsequent 10, 15 years. As regards my own research work, it was early in 1%5 that I presented a&#13;
&#13;
paper at an international conference in Cambridge, England on tax policy and savings, out of&#13;
&#13;
which arose the concept of the so-called "Please Effect" in the literature of fiscal economics. I&#13;
&#13;
think I should record here that to the best of my recollection this term was first used by Ben&#13;
&#13;
[Benjamin B.] King, who was a member of the Economics Department at that time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Now a critical issue on fiscal work that arose at that time was the relationship between the&#13;
&#13;
Bank and the Fund in undertaking this work. It was recognized as one of the areas of shared&#13;
&#13;
responsibility. Quite clearly there was enormous interest in the IMP in tax policy and&#13;
&#13;
expenditure policy as part of the whole focus of stabilization issues. Within the Bank there was&#13;
&#13;
also enormous interest in the same issues from the point of view of longer term development,&#13;
&#13;
mobilizing savings, generating funds by the public sector and by government, funding government&#13;
&#13;
expenditure programs focused on development--education, infrastructure, expenditure, and the&#13;
&#13;
like. And it came to be recognized that both institutions should, either jointly or separately, be&#13;
&#13;
devoting increased attention to these issues of fiscal policy. The question was where that&#13;
&#13;
additional work should be undertaken. There were clear arguments for either institution to take&#13;
&#13;
the leading role and the major responsibility in this work. I was myself fairly neutral on the issue;&#13;
&#13;
at the time I suppose in a sense I had a personal and bureaucratic interest in seeing the major&#13;
&#13;
work be in the Bank, but I would have been quite happy if it went to the IMP, providing the work&#13;
&#13;
were seriously undertaken.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Could I break in here just for a moment? Going through some of the old ftles in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank, and especially talking to some of the other people in the Oral History Program,&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                              -3-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[ZIEGLER]&#13;
&#13;
cooperation, or shall we say relations between the Bank and the Fund, have not always been the&#13;
&#13;
happiest. Would you comment on your own relations with Fund staff and perhaps reflect on&#13;
&#13;
some of the reasons for this, if you will, love-hate relationship between the two institutions, which&#13;
&#13;
I understand still goes on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PLEASE: Yes. As a general matter, I often say that the friendly animosities, the professional&#13;
&#13;
rivalries, etcetera, that exist between the Fund and the Bank are no more and no less than the&#13;
&#13;
same animosities that exist between, shall we say, program staff and project staff within the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
between the researchers and the operational staff within the Bank. But of course within the Bank&#13;
&#13;
there is one head and eventually everybody has to show loyalty and adherence to the decisions of&#13;
&#13;
one management. In the case of relationships with the Fund, there is a divided management and&#13;
&#13;
consequently everybody works to the drum of his own institution. That creates an additional&#13;
&#13;
dimension that clearly, to the outside world and within the institutions, causes particular&#13;
&#13;
problems. But that said, there are not only differences in responsibilities--for example, the&#13;
&#13;
Fund's responsibility for short-run stabilization, for dealing with crisis issues, the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
responsibility for longer-term development--there's also a problem of style.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    If I can just put on record here, for instance, an example relating to my paper, which&#13;
&#13;
subsequently came to be called the 'Please Effect' paper. It was published in Finance and&#13;
&#13;
Development. the joint Fund-Bank magazine, but it was published in that magazine over the veto&#13;
&#13;
of the IMF. The IMF took the view, and took it to the highest levels of management in the Bank&#13;
&#13;
and the Fund, that the paper should not be published because it suggested that increased taxation&#13;
&#13;
in developing countries was not always a desirable objective of policy change for the Bank and the&#13;
&#13;
Fund to pursue with governments, because so often the increased revenues went not to&#13;
&#13;
development or to savings but to finance things like defense, and in some countries&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                            - 4-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(PLEASE)&#13;
&#13;
excessive salaries, excessive subsidies, things which from a development point of view had no&#13;
&#13;
priority whatsoever, and in fact were in many cases counterdevelopmental.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    In retrospect it's interesting to me, as someone who joined the Bank as a Socialist and still&#13;
&#13;
remains a Socialist, that the Bank has come full circle on this issue. I was the one who was&#13;
&#13;
questioning the role of government in the 1960s. It has taken 15 or 20 years for Western&#13;
&#13;
governments, obviously U.S. and British, but also the Bank and the Fund, to start questioning the&#13;
&#13;
role of government as opposed to the roles of the private sector, whereas I was questioning that&#13;
&#13;
in the 1960s. But the Fund didn't like my views and the Fund said if that article gets published we&#13;
&#13;
will have it referred to when we are negotiating with governments and telling them they've got to&#13;
&#13;
push up taxes. They will say, look, here is this paper from the World Bank man, we presume with&#13;
&#13;
the World Bank imprimatur, which suggests that increased taxes are not necessarily a good thing.&#13;
&#13;
It is to the credit particularly of Sir Geoffrey Wilson, who was the Vice President at that time&#13;
&#13;
along with Burke Knapp, and to Benjamin King, that they refused to accept the veto of the IMF&#13;
&#13;
and insisted that this paper be published. Even though they didn't necessarily agree with it, they&#13;
&#13;
felt that it was felt it was an honest statement of a concern that the Bank and the Fund had to&#13;
&#13;
accept and therefore its publication should not be vetoed. And in the end it was published in&#13;
&#13;
Finance and Development and was subsequently re-published elsewhere. It has been referred to&#13;
&#13;
on many occasions. I should add that one of the major opponents of publication in the Fund was&#13;
&#13;
Richard Goode who subsequently became--and I'll get onto this story in a little while--Director of&#13;
&#13;
the Fund's Fiscal Affairs Department. And when Richard Goode retired, I think it was in&#13;
&#13;
something like 1981 or 1982, because he was a man of great intellectual honesty, he in fact wrote&#13;
&#13;
to me and said that in retrospect he recognized that what I'd been saying in the 1960s had been&#13;
&#13;
valid and that the problems, particularly in Africa but also in other parts of the developing world,&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                             -5-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE)&#13;
&#13;
were not problems of taxation, they were problems of government expenditure. He emphasized&#13;
&#13;
that in the future the Bank and the Fund had to devote much more time to the expenditure issues&#13;
&#13;
and that it had been wrong for the IMF to emphasize the raising of additional revenues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Now I tell the story not so much because of the personal interest in it as to reflect one of the&#13;
&#13;
problems of the Fund. It is much more secretive than the Bank. It is always concerned that its&#13;
&#13;
strength as a negotiating body will be weakened if its concerns are subject to too much criticism&#13;
&#13;
from outside and particularly too much criticisms from within the Bank and the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The Bank, on the other hand has, I think, always been a much more soul-searching&#13;
&#13;
organization. It has always seen the problems of development as terribly complex, and&#13;
&#13;
consequently there has been a long history of acceptance of different perspectives within the&#13;
&#13;
Bank and of willingness to see those expressed in public. And this is at the heart of some of the&#13;
&#13;
problems of Bank-Fund collaboration. It comes out most obviously in official documents. The&#13;
&#13;
Fund is so concerned that documents in which analysis or policy conclusions are presented will&#13;
&#13;
get into the public eye or be leaked to the press that it quite often is very anxious when it hands&#13;
&#13;
over those documents to the Bank. It feels the Bank leaks like a sieve and therefore handing the&#13;
&#13;
documents over to Bank staff virtually makes them accessible to journalists and others.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Does it leak like a sieve? I mean, you see Jack Anderson's columns in The&#13;
&#13;
Washington Post occasionally about Brazil and Indonesia, etcetera.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PLEASE: Precisely. You know, that's the other side of the coin. Because the Bank knows it's&#13;
&#13;
dealing with complex problems and wants, in a sense, to make its concerns known to the outside&#13;
&#13;
world, or many people do, that does mean it leaks like a sieve and that makes negotiation very&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                               - 6-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(PLEASE]&#13;
&#13;
difficult when you have to keep your negotiation position very confidential. And that creates&#13;
&#13;
animosities because if the Fund doesn't come dean with all its documents, the Bank staff feel that&#13;
&#13;
there's not an open and intellectually honest relationship between the two institutions. As a Bank&#13;
&#13;
person I don't want to be too critical of the Fund on that; I think they have a difficult job to do.&#13;
&#13;
They feel, rightly or wrongly, that things have to be done with great confidentiality. And they&#13;
&#13;
know that the Bank leaks, not in any deliberate or criminal way, it just is not so security conscious&#13;
&#13;
and this creates certain tensions which it is very difficult to resolve.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Since the Bank introduced structural adjustment lending in 1980, a lot of concern has been&#13;
&#13;
expressed that Bank-Fund collaboration should be improved, that collaboration should be closer,&#13;
&#13;
there should be joint programs, and those sort of developments which are recorded in Bank's&#13;
&#13;
documents and presumably as part of the Bank's oral history. I should add that, under Ernie&#13;
&#13;
[Ernest] Stern, I was responsible for Bank-Fund collaboration from 1980 until I retired in 1983.&#13;
&#13;
In this discussion of better collaboration during the 1980s there was frequent reference on the&#13;
&#13;
Fund side to the way in which collaboration had worked so well in the 1960s on fiscal policy, for&#13;
&#13;
which I also happened to be responsible. And I find this amusing and ironic because in the 1960s&#13;
&#13;
there were a lot of tensions. I've already referred to the tension over my own article and its&#13;
&#13;
publication. There was tension, as I hinted earlier, over the granting of primary responsibility for&#13;
&#13;
work on fiscal policy. And as I indicated, this responsibility could have gone to either institution,&#13;
&#13;
but in the end it was decided that the IMF should establish a department which came to be called&#13;
&#13;
the Fiscal Affairs Department. I'm not sure at this moment in time what precise year that was&#13;
&#13;
established but I believe it was something like 1966. And immediately of course when that&#13;
&#13;
department was established it raised the question, how is that department going to relate to the&#13;
&#13;
Fiscal Division in the Economics Department in the Bank, for which I was responsible.&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                             . 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE)&#13;
&#13;
The Fund claimed supremacy on all technical assistance work in the fiscal field, which meant&#13;
&#13;
work on budgeting, work on expenditure control, public accounting and that sort of thing. There&#13;
&#13;
was a recognition that there was a shared responsibility for work on fiscal policy, tax policy and&#13;
&#13;
expenditure policy. But once again the Fund claimed that it had a primary responsibility here,&#13;
&#13;
even though the Bank had a joint interest and its views should be made known whenever the&#13;
&#13;
Bank had independent views on fiscal policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    It was a difficult relationship because the Fund had set up a whole Fiscal Affairs Department&#13;
&#13;
and all the Bank had was a division, which was smaller. I think the Fiscal Affairs Department&#13;
&#13;
had something like 20 people. I had about, if I recall, four, five, or six people in the middle 1960s.&#13;
&#13;
It was difficult because Dick Goode was a man who didn't smile; he didn't easily yield to&#13;
&#13;
blandishments and to humor. He was a very stiff bureaucrat and therefore he interpreted the&#13;
&#13;
responsibility of the IMF and his own department very strongly and very narrowly. And&#13;
&#13;
whenever the Bank transgressed its own fields of interests and went into the fields of the Fund,&#13;
&#13;
inevitably there were complaints on paper from the IMF. So it was a very difficult relationship.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    We tried to get it on a systematic basis in the 1960's and early 1970's, and this experience&#13;
&#13;
once again was often referred to during the discussion in the 1980s by having regular monthly&#13;
&#13;
meetings between the Fiscal Affairs Department of the Fund, at which Dick Goode, the Director,&#13;
&#13;
and typically two of his senior men, including the deputy director, would attend. On the Bank&#13;
&#13;
side it was always headed up again by the director of the Economics Department, typically Andy&#13;
&#13;
[Andrew M.) Kamarck, with myself in support as the division chief responsible for fiscal work.&#13;
&#13;
And at those monthly meetings, which were held alternately in the Fund and in the Bank&#13;
&#13;
premises, we discussed all the fiscal work which the Fund was planning to undertake, which the&#13;
&#13;
Bank was planning to undertake, the focus of work. And after those discussions&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                            - 8-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE)&#13;
&#13;
we looked at areas where potential conflict could have arisen, for example because both the Bank&#13;
&#13;
and the Fund were planning to work on tax policy in a particular country. And in that way we&#13;
&#13;
tried to act as a lightning rod for some of the problems in Bank-Fund collaboration in the ftseal&#13;
&#13;
field. And certainly I think it did a lot of good, it coordinated our work. Certainly on the Bank&#13;
&#13;
side it made us much more knowledgeable about all the initiatives of technical assistance in the&#13;
&#13;
fiscal field that the Fund was planning to undertake even at a very early stage. It enabled us to&#13;
&#13;
seek the advice of the Bank country economists or others where the Fund was planning certain&#13;
&#13;
work to see if that work appeared to have priority and be correctly focused, so in retrospect it&#13;
&#13;
probably worked extremely well. It became a regular feature of the circulation of documents in&#13;
&#13;
the Bank for me to issue a monthly report on the activities ongoing and proposed of the Fiscal&#13;
&#13;
Affairs Department and that went to the relevant area departments, country division chiefs and&#13;
&#13;
the like.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     So it was a good case, in retrospect, of collaboration which increased the amount of&#13;
&#13;
information on both sides, which, as I say, acted as a lightning rod to try to avoid problems when&#13;
&#13;
problems might have otherwise arisen. But nevertheless, from time to time difficulties did occur&#13;
&#13;
and the Fund, in its rather superior, paternalistic, I would say slightly arrogant manner, made&#13;
&#13;
known its displeasure over things the Bank was doing. I think on our side we rarely did that,&#13;
&#13;
maybe because the Fund never transgressed into our field so we never had occasion to do so. But&#13;
&#13;
on a few occasion when we did transgress, it was certainly brought very sharply to our notice. We&#13;
&#13;
sort of got rapped over the knuckles, as it were, as an institution and me as a person I suppose. It&#13;
&#13;
was unpleasant and done in an offensive way that did not make one feel charitably disposed&#13;
&#13;
towards the Fund. It could have been done in a better way which showed more more of a spirt of&#13;
&#13;
cooperation between equals than of the collaboration of a superior Fund and an inferior Bank.&#13;
&#13;
And so, I was left with a certain bad taste in my mouth but I wouldn't wish to exaggerate that.&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                             - 9-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE)&#13;
&#13;
    I can illustrate it by the fact that--I forget the dates now but it must have been late in the&#13;
&#13;
1960s, 1970--we undertook a major piece of work on tax policy in Ethiopia in which we were&#13;
&#13;
deeply involved before the revolution that overthrew the Emperor in 1974. It was undertaken by&#13;
&#13;
a very distinguished American. The Fund took a really hostile view to that piece of work. In&#13;
&#13;
retrospect, I cannot to this day make out how it was we embarked on the work without the Fund&#13;
&#13;
being aware of what we were doing, but certainly we did. And when the report finally emerged&#13;
&#13;
they were beside themselves in fury at the nature of the report. Likewise they took a very&#13;
&#13;
negative view when, for instance, I was asked by the Pakistan government in 1971 to be a fiscal&#13;
&#13;
advisor to the Pakistan Tax Commission. Now that was a request that came quite clearly in a&#13;
&#13;
formal sense to the Bank, but it was really a personal request for my services to be made&#13;
&#13;
available to the Pakistan Tax Commission. The Fund virtually vetoed my acceptance of that&#13;
&#13;
request and the Bank's acceptance of that request for my services on the ground that tax policy in&#13;
&#13;
Pakistan was a matter in which the Fund had been deeply involved, as they certainly had been,&#13;
&#13;
that there was no reason why the Bank should be involved, and that they, the Fund, had the&#13;
&#13;
responsibility for that work. Now it was somewhat irouic, I suppose, that the Secretary of the the&#13;
&#13;
Pakistan Tax Commission was an IMP man who was on three years--I think it was three years-&#13;
&#13;
-secondment to his national government, and it was he who had requested my services.&#13;
&#13;
Incidentally, I did not know him at that time, but he had heard about my work on tax policy in&#13;
&#13;
India and he was very anxious that I should do comparable work for them in Pakistan. It was&#13;
&#13;
rather irouic that it was the Fund man on secondment who had requested my services and then&#13;
&#13;
the Fund's Fiscal Affairs Department tried to veto it. In fact, in the end the Bank insisted that I&#13;
&#13;
be permitted to do the work and I did do that work during the period 1971-1972. That IMP&#13;
&#13;
official has since become Director of The Office of External Relations of the Fund, namely&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                              - 10-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE)&#13;
&#13;
Azizali F. Mohammed. I think that's of interest in that he undoubtedly is regarded in the Fund as&#13;
&#13;
one of those who is far, far less bureaucratic than most of the Fund staff. Which gets us back to&#13;
&#13;
this whole question of relationships and collaboration with the Fund. It has proved difficult to get&#13;
&#13;
collaboration in substance because of the difference in responsibilities, but it has been made far&#13;
&#13;
more difficult by the nature of the Fund as a human institution which is secretive, which is&#13;
&#13;
arrogant, which is very patronizing in terms of what the Bank does as opposed to what they do,&#13;
&#13;
this whole superior attitude of the Fund in always treating the Bank as a second-class citizen.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    And that attitude has persistently poisoned the collaboration between the Bank and the&#13;
&#13;
Fund. Ifl could jump, in fact, in time...&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: I don't want to break your train of thought, but early on in your career you were&#13;
&#13;
under George Woods. Did you have any contact with him and, if so, would you like to say a bit&#13;
&#13;
about him in terms of your own relationship with him?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PLEASE: No, really, I had no relationship whatsoever with George Woods. I worked with&#13;
&#13;
Bernie [Bernard) Bell as I've already said. Bernie Bell had a close personal relationship with&#13;
&#13;
George Woods through the work on India, but I never had any direct contact with George&#13;
&#13;
Woods, even meetings. Clearly I saw him as Chairman of the Board when I attended Board&#13;
&#13;
meetings, but I didn't frequently do that because I wasn't a member of the operational staff. The&#13;
&#13;
senior man I dealt with was Sir Geoffrey Wilson, firstly because I think at that time he was&#13;
&#13;
formally in charge of the economic complex of the Bank; secondly because, I suppose, he was an&#13;
&#13;
Englishman and he rather took to me, he befriended me. It so happens that Geoffrey Wilson is&#13;
&#13;
an Oxford resident. In fact he's got a long Oxford history. He was president of Oxfam for many&#13;
&#13;
years after he retired. In talking to Geoffrey Wilson in recent years since I retired, clearly he feels&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                             - 11-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE)&#13;
&#13;
deeply hurt by his treatment by George Woods and by the difficulties of dealing with George&#13;
&#13;
Woods. I just report that because I have nothing directly to comment on George Woods himself.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I suppose if I can reflect a little more generally on this, I would say that looking back over&#13;
&#13;
the history of the Bank, George Woods' contribution to what interests me in the Bank, namely&#13;
&#13;
the Bank's involvement in policy analysis and policy change in developing countries as opposed to&#13;
&#13;
the project fmancing side of the Bank, I think George Woods' contribution there has been grossly&#13;
&#13;
underrated, particularly against that of [Robert) McNamara, who is known to have been greatly&#13;
&#13;
interested in development policy. But when you look back, some of the major departures in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank were made under George Woods, including building up the economic staff, moving into&#13;
&#13;
agriculture, into education, into industry as areas in which the Bank had to move in a big way, the&#13;
&#13;
appointment of Irving Friedman as The Economic Adviser to the President. Woods' involvement&#13;
&#13;
in the Indian exercise is also of interest in this regard. After the period of the 1950s when all the&#13;
&#13;
Western world thought India did everything right and could do nothing wrong in terms of&#13;
&#13;
development policy, suddenly in the 1960s everybody felt that it was all going sour, population&#13;
&#13;
was growing too rapidly, production was going down. Woods clearly recognized that he had a&#13;
&#13;
major development problem on his hands in the next to the largest country in the world and he&#13;
&#13;
set up the Bell Mission to try to provide guidance from the Western world to the Indians, and to&#13;
&#13;
the Bank itself. If I think of him not in terms of his personal relationships--which seem to have&#13;
&#13;
been widely regarded as encouraging friction rather than collaboration--but in terms of how he&#13;
&#13;
saw the Bank evolving in its responsibilities, it seems to me that he has to be given credit for&#13;
&#13;
major steps forward in the 1960s, steps forward which McNamara was then able to build upon.&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                            - 12-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE]&#13;
&#13;
     I would disagree with people like Hollis Chenery and Ernie Stern that somehow serious&#13;
&#13;
economic work, concern over economic policy, began when McNamara, Chenery and Ernie Stern&#13;
&#13;
came on board. I think that is grossly inaccurate, a gross distortion of the record. If you look at&#13;
&#13;
the record, even right back in the 1950s, some outstanding economic work was done both in&#13;
&#13;
terms of country focus and also a few more general pieces, as I've already indicated in my own&#13;
&#13;
field, like the work of van der Mel and Plasschaert on tax policy. The Bank was deeply involved&#13;
&#13;
in economic policy and economic policy analysis long before Chenery, Stern and MeNamara&#13;
&#13;
came on board. What they managed to do was give it far more "oomph" in terms of its&#13;
&#13;
importance, moving it to the center stage in the Bank. Instead of economic work being rather&#13;
&#13;
frowned upon by the operating part of the institution, work on economic policy has become&#13;
&#13;
increasingly accepted through the 1970s and most obviously through the 1980s as the centerpiece&#13;
&#13;
not ouly of the intellectual contribution of the Bank but of the Bank's operational involvement in&#13;
&#13;
the world. But I think Woods' contribution to that change has, in my perception, tended to be&#13;
&#13;
underrated because people didn't like the man so they don't like to credit him with having done&#13;
&#13;
anything favorable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Mr. Please, you were taken on by Ernie Stern as a senior advisor in 1980, specifically&#13;
&#13;
to run the structural adjustment lending program from his office. Would you care to comment a&#13;
&#13;
bit about your experiences in that context?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PLEASE: Certainly. Yes, I suppose the reason why I was taken on was that I had been&#13;
&#13;
responsible as Director and Acting Vice President in Eastern Africa for some of the very few&#13;
&#13;
policy-based lending operations in which the Bank had been involved during its history. These&#13;
&#13;
were program loans to Kenya, to Tanzania, to Zambia in the period 1973-1974-1975 and they are&#13;
&#13;
of interest because they were quick-disbursing operations given to those countries at a time when&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                             - 13-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE)&#13;
&#13;
they were badly hit by rising oil prices and falling prices of their export commodities: tea, coffee,&#13;
&#13;
jute, copper, etcetera. We We used the opportunity, from the East Africa region, of giving&#13;
&#13;
quick-disbursing program loan assistance to sharpen up the government's commitment to make&#13;
&#13;
major policy changes, particularly in relationship to agricultural pricing, agricultural marketing,&#13;
&#13;
and a range of other issues which were troubling us at that period about the performance of the&#13;
&#13;
Tanzania, Kenyan and Zambian economies. So that when the second oil crisis came along in the&#13;
&#13;
summer of 1979, the Bank decided that it really had to move on a much broader front to deal&#13;
&#13;
with the desperate needs of the non-oil exporting developing countries, for quick-disbursing&#13;
&#13;
money, but that it had to link this desperate need they had for foreign exchange to major policy&#13;
&#13;
reforms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Now this has an earlier history also. At the UNCfAD meeting in Manila in 1979,&#13;
&#13;
McNamara had indicated very clearly to the developing countries that he would be willing to give&#13;
&#13;
program loan assistance, non-project assistance, to countries that were taking policy reform very&#13;
&#13;
seriously. At that time I was Director of the Country Programs Department in the East Asia and&#13;
&#13;
Pacific region, and we immediately took that McNamara initiative up in the context of our&#13;
&#13;
industrial lending operations, because in the Philippines and other East Asian countries industrial&#13;
&#13;
development seemed to us to be the critical area for moving ahead. Later that became part of&#13;
&#13;
the structural adjustment lending program as a whole.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I make that point because the idea of moving to policy-based lending did originate before the&#13;
&#13;
fall in oil prices in the summer of 1979. I think that reflected the view that I had developed&#13;
&#13;
throughout the 1970s, that I think McNamara and Ernie Stern fmally accepted--although they had&#13;
&#13;
not convinced many of their colleagues--namely that the combination of project lending with&#13;
&#13;
dialogue on economic policy based on bank economic reports was not adequate for getting&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                             - 14-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE]&#13;
&#13;
governments to take policy reform more seriously. Project lending tended to have a life of its&#13;
&#13;
own--preparation, appraisal, negotiation, disbursements, implementation, etcetera, and it is very&#13;
&#13;
difficult to sharpen up project lending so as to provide more immediate support, or withdraw&#13;
&#13;
support from governments that were or were not taking appropriate policy action on whatever it&#13;
&#13;
was, on agriculture pricing, marketing institutions, industrial policy, etcetera. So that there was&#13;
&#13;
that growing awareness by McNamara in the period 1979-1980 that he really did have to think of&#13;
&#13;
augmenting project lending by quick-disbursing money that was linked entirely to policy reform;&#13;
&#13;
that policy reform was so important it just could not be left simply to dialogue supported by&#13;
&#13;
project lending. And that certaiuly reinforced a view that I had long been developing and which&#13;
&#13;
of course I subsequently explained much more fully in the series of essays which I wrote after I&#13;
&#13;
retired, called The Hobbled Giant, essays on the World Bank. But, although McNamara first&#13;
&#13;
announced the idea at UNCfAD in Manila early in 1979, it took the second oil crisis in the&#13;
&#13;
summer of 1979 to really speed up action. And early in 1980 a very short document was&#13;
&#13;
submitted to the Board arguing for structural adjustment lending on a systematic basis to all&#13;
&#13;
those oil-importing developing countries that were willing to agree with the Bank on a program&#13;
&#13;
of policy change. The Bank would link its disbursements over a period of roughly five years to&#13;
&#13;
the formulation of each stage of policy reform and its implementation. I was brought in, as I&#13;
&#13;
already indicated, by Ernie Stem in May of 1980 to help him run this program, to work with the&#13;
&#13;
regions in formulating these programs, to monitor their unfolding, etcetera.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I have to say that the Board ouly reluctantly agreed to the notion of structural adjustment&#13;
&#13;
lending. The Board was unhappy to begin with that a major departure in policy of this nature by&#13;
&#13;
the Bank had been foisted upon them by a very brief document--as I recall, it was a document of&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                             . 15.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE]&#13;
&#13;
four or five pages in length--and that left them very unhappy. This was clearly apparent in the&#13;
&#13;
records of Board meetings and was certainly reiterated in private discussions with Board&#13;
&#13;
members. They felt that they were not being given the full systematic presentation of why it was&#13;
&#13;
necessary to have structural adjustment lending to deal with the policy problems that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
wished to handle. The substance of their concern was, namely, why was it that further fmancial&#13;
&#13;
support for policy reform was required in developing countries. First, the IMF was already&#13;
&#13;
lending in support of policy reform with quick-disbursing money; why, therefore, was it necessary&#13;
&#13;
for the Bank to have a quick-disbursing operational modality also in support of policy reform.&#13;
&#13;
Second, the Bank had always said its dialogues with governments on sector and macro policy&#13;
&#13;
reform were very robust, and that governments took very seriously what the Bank said.&#13;
&#13;
Moreover, and thirdly, the Bank had always argued that its project lending had policy&#13;
&#13;
conditionality attached which provided the necessary operational "handle" to make the dialogue&#13;
&#13;
on policy issues effective, if necessary, through suspending disbursements on existing projects or&#13;
&#13;
refusing to proceed with new projects. Fourthly, many of the Executive Directors argued, policy&#13;
&#13;
reform didn't cost money. It wasn't like a project where you had to buy the steel and the bricks&#13;
&#13;
and all the other inputs for projects; you didn't need money to buy anything. Either governments&#13;
&#13;
changed policies or they didn't, and it didn't cost them any money. And so there was great&#13;
&#13;
unease in the Board, which remained for several years, about the need for structural adjustment&#13;
&#13;
lending. Each operation that we had was like pulling teeth, both before it was presented, in terms&#13;
&#13;
of prior discussions with particular Board members, and at the Board. And this was not a matter&#13;
&#13;
where developed and developing countries were divided. The developed countries felt that the&#13;
&#13;
Bank was moving from its mandate in supporting development into quick-disbursing non-project&#13;
&#13;
lending, and developing countries took the view that one IMF was enough on policy matters.&#13;
&#13;
They didn't want the Bank to be getting into policy "leverage"; it would sour relations with&#13;
&#13;
developing countries; policy reform was a difficult matter, a very political matter and therefore it&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                            - 16-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE]&#13;
&#13;
would politicize the Bank. There was a lot of concern on both developing and developed country&#13;
&#13;
seats in the Board.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Not only was structural adjustment lending causing a sense of unease on the Board, but&#13;
&#13;
throughout the Bank at all levels there was a good deal of skepticism: we were throwing money at&#13;
&#13;
problems; if we couldn't deal with policy reform through dialogue and project lending we weren't&#13;
&#13;
doing our job, we didn't need structural adjustment lending for that purpose. And so structural&#13;
&#13;
adjustment lending had few friends within the operating departments at most levels. Where it&#13;
&#13;
was welcome was typically at the lower levels, the loan officer, the country economist, who could&#13;
&#13;
see the country suffering enormously from very badly distorted external terms of trade: high oil&#13;
&#13;
prices, high industrial goods prices, but very low prices for export goods. The terms of trade were&#13;
&#13;
very adverse; therefore these countries had desperate external and internal fmancial problems.&#13;
&#13;
And therefore these people saw structural adjustment lending as a way of providing quick&#13;
&#13;
assistance to them. But, of course, when it came to saying yes but the conditions have to be there,&#13;
&#13;
and these will be harder conditions than the IMF and they have to be conditions where you have&#13;
&#13;
to be convinced they can be sustained over not just one year but over five years, then even those&#13;
&#13;
staff who were wanting to get money quickly disbursed began to pull back a little in their&#13;
&#13;
enthusiasm.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So I had welcomed structural adjustment lending with open arms, having always been&#13;
&#13;
convinced that the World Bank's comparative advantage over bilateral lenders and over&#13;
&#13;
European, OPEC lending agencies, etcetera, was in policy lending rather than in project lending.&#13;
&#13;
Clearly McNamara and Ernie Stern came to be more and more convinced about that, but support&#13;
&#13;
for that position more generally in the Bank, on the operational side, was weak. I should add that&#13;
&#13;
those who were at that time on the economic side of the Bank, people like Mahbub ul Haq,&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                             - 17-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE)&#13;
&#13;
Sidney Chernick, [Pierre) Landeli-Mills, who were on the staff side of the Bank, were in fact very&#13;
&#13;
supportive of structural adjustment lending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The early stages of structural adjustment lending were quite clearly concerned with some of&#13;
&#13;
the nuts and bolts issues. We early on hit upon the notion of drawing up what we called a matrix&#13;
&#13;
of actions to be taken over time, actions that had to be taken on exports, on the source&#13;
&#13;
mobilization, etcetera, what would be done over the years. The so-called matrix of policy reform&#13;
&#13;
became established very early in the structural adjustment lending process. The whole question&#13;
&#13;
of disbursements, the whole question of competitive bidding, all these issues had to be dealt with&#13;
&#13;
in detail and quite quickly because once the approval from the Board was there, we had several&#13;
&#13;
operations right on the drawing board which moved ahead quickly, those to Bolivia--which was a&#13;
&#13;
disaster from the beginning, we moved far too quickly in the Bolivian case--to Turkey, to Kenya.&#13;
&#13;
These came along very quickly, so we had to get these operations moving and therefore deal with&#13;
&#13;
the nuts and bolts issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Mr. Please, you said there was considerable, shall we say, resistance or skepticism on&#13;
&#13;
the part of the Executive Board, yet clearly to get these loans going they had to approve them.&#13;
&#13;
Was there any particular means by which they were convinced to approve these loans? Or were&#13;
&#13;
they bullied into it? Can you describe how you and your colleagues convinced a skeptical and&#13;
&#13;
reluctant Board to actually go along with this?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PLEASE: Yes. Well, first, it has to be said that in the last year or so, particularly since the&#13;
&#13;
Baker Plan, what was regarded from 1980 to about 1984-1985 with great skepticism has now been&#13;
&#13;
taken on as the centerpiece of Bank support for joint IMF-World Bank operations in support of&#13;
&#13;
Baker Plan objective. In the last year or so this unease has been--I think one could say-&#13;
&#13;
-completely removed, after remaining for three or four years. And it is I think an interesting&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                             . 18.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(PLEASE)&#13;
&#13;
reflection on the way the Bank operates, how it was we managed to get through so many&#13;
&#13;
operations at that time. To begin with, the Board was given the assurance that not more than 10&#13;
&#13;
percent of the Bank's lending operations in any one year would in fact go for structural&#13;
&#13;
adjustment lending. In that sense the Board was assured that whatever their concerns might be,&#13;
&#13;
this lending wouldn't be more than 10 percent anyway, so that that gave them some reassurance&#13;
&#13;
that, in their view, it wouldn't run wild.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Second, I think there was a real concern with the people I spoke to at that time on the&#13;
&#13;
Board, the Alternates, the assistants, etcetera, that the Bank had always said that it could do a lot&#13;
&#13;
through policy dialogue. When we had submitted projects to the Board in the 1960s and the&#13;
&#13;
1970s in the early part of a President's report we said all the good things we were doing in the&#13;
&#13;
policy area of the sector and at the macro levta, before going to on to present the project.&#13;
&#13;
Somehow I think there was a sense by Board members of having been let down; that when it&#13;
&#13;
carne to saying we had to have structural adjustment lending, we were saying that in fact we&#13;
&#13;
hadn't achieved all those good policy changes. It was so urgent in 1980-plus that policy reform be&#13;
&#13;
introduced because the international environment in which developing countries were operating&#13;
&#13;
had turned so negative for them. The Board felt that the Bank was being just a little two-faced&#13;
&#13;
because it had said it had been able to effect all these policy changes in the 1970s, now it turned&#13;
&#13;
out they couldn't; therefore policy reform was urgent and they needed structural adjustment&#13;
&#13;
lending. There was therefore a certain lack of credibility of what the Bank staff had been saying&#13;
&#13;
previously, and there was some unhappiness about this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I think at the end of the day, though, there was a recognition by the Board that developing&#13;
&#13;
countries certainly needed immediate assistance; their balance of payments and the matching&#13;
&#13;
domestic budgetary problem were so desperate that certainly quick-disbursing money would&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                              - 19-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE]&#13;
&#13;
difficult to deny those governments if they were really trying to get their act together in terms of&#13;
&#13;
policy reform. It would be no good saying, "We'll give them more projects." Those projects&#13;
&#13;
would take five years, seven years, eight years to disburse. They needed the money now. The&#13;
&#13;
Board was uneasy, I think, that if they vetoed structural adjustment lending they would be cutting&#13;
&#13;
off what was clearly urgently needed money from governments that were genuinely trying&#13;
&#13;
to struggle to get results from policy reform. It would be wrong to deny these countries this money&#13;
&#13;
in a situation in which the staff and the management said it was necessary and the policy reform&#13;
&#13;
had been undertaken.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    My own experience with most Board members is that they show enormous deference to the&#13;
&#13;
Bank staff and the Bank's management in terms of saying, "Look, you people on the staff and&#13;
&#13;
management know more about development and the needs of developing countries than we on the&#13;
&#13;
Board do. We have our concerns and our problems, but you're the people we have to rely on for&#13;
&#13;
expert guidance." In the SAL [Structural Adjustment Lending] discussion in 1980 and 1981, this&#13;
&#13;
occurred several times with me. They would say to me, "This is a very private discussion. You can&#13;
&#13;
see we're unhappy, but if you people, who clearly know more about the needs and potentials of&#13;
&#13;
these countries, feel that this is the ouly way to go at this stage to help them in a solid way, then&#13;
&#13;
okay, we'll go along. But recognize we're not altogether convinced." I think in a sense it was an&#13;
&#13;
interesting reflection about many Board members and in a sense a very healthy one; one that I&#13;
&#13;
think the Bank management sense a very healthy one; one that I think the Bank management and&#13;
&#13;
Bank staff should take seriously. Most Board members don't want to be seen as simply&#13;
&#13;
judging, double-checking on staff, but they want to have confidence that the Bank staff and&#13;
&#13;
management are not misleading them.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    It gets back to my original point about the four or five page document that&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                             -20-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE]&#13;
&#13;
introduced structural adjustment lending. They felt that was an effrontery to their dignity. A&#13;
&#13;
major change in policy was in effect being forced down their throats on the basis of a very slim&#13;
&#13;
document. I think it was this document that really started the whole thing off on the wrong foot,&#13;
&#13;
caused a certain amount of, let's be honest, a certain amount of antagonism toward Ernie Stern&#13;
&#13;
himself who was seen as the author of that paper; a certain amount of personal antagonism&#13;
&#13;
towards Ernie Stern on the structural adjustment lending issue, even though there was high&#13;
&#13;
regard for him of course in terms of his knowledge and ability.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Incidentally, as an aside, although there has always been a lot of anger among Board and&#13;
&#13;
staff members toward Ernie Stern as a person for being very rude and all that, I should add this&#13;
&#13;
personal reminiscence. I had fallen sick, emotionally and mentally, in January 1980 and had to&#13;
&#13;
return to England for four or five months. It was Ernie Stern who, when I had written off coming&#13;
&#13;
back to the Bank and had decided to retire early, personally asked me to go back to the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
He was very lavish in his expressions of need for someone like myself to run the program. It was&#13;
&#13;
he personally, in a sense, who picked me up from falling over the cliff and took me back to&#13;
&#13;
Washington. He was personally very supportive to me even though we fell out on many&#13;
&#13;
occasions. I'd like to record this about Ernie Stern as a person, because he will be the butt of a&#13;
&#13;
lot of criticism in your oral history and in many other histories that are written, and for reasons&#13;
&#13;
which will be explained there. But I'd like to recall that Ernie Stern was a very warm person on&#13;
&#13;
the personalleve~ not ouly to me but to my colleague Norman Horsley, who died some three&#13;
&#13;
years ago, who was a senior advisor on the operational side.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I took responsibility for trying to get the staff and the management in the operational regions&#13;
&#13;
to recognize that structural adjustment lending was absolutely essential as the Bank moved into&#13;
&#13;
the 1980s. I argued that in particular it wasn't a plaything of programs departments; that in fact&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                            -21-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE]&#13;
&#13;
structural adjustment lending in effect was concerned not so much with macro policy; that could&#13;
&#13;
be left to the Fund. Macro policy responsibility of programs departments could very much be left&#13;
&#13;
to the Fund. The critical part of structural adjustment lending was really the sector programs;&#13;
&#13;
programs of policy reform for africulture, for energy, for industry, the whole question of the&#13;
&#13;
better formulation and implementation of public investment programs, of institutional&#13;
&#13;
development. All these issues are essentially areas of concern in which the projects side of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank has the expertise. What concerned me right from the beginning was that structural&#13;
&#13;
adjustment lending was seen as programs department responsibility. I had a special series of&#13;
&#13;
meetings, maiuly lunch meetings, on a one-on-one basis with each of the projects department&#13;
&#13;
Directors, and it amazed me how little they considered themselves involved and responsible for&#13;
&#13;
SAL operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    For instance, David Knox, a personal friend of mine--we joined the Bank together--was&#13;
&#13;
Director of the Projects Department of the EMENA region at that time. I said to him, starting&#13;
&#13;
off the meeting, "Well, how deeply are you involved in the structural adjustment lending&#13;
&#13;
operations in Turkey?" This was the biggest SAL operations throughout the structural&#13;
&#13;
adjustment lending program, also one of the earliest ones, and, incidentally, one of the most&#13;
&#13;
successful. He said, "Oh, well, it's nothing to do with me. We just have to check on the&#13;
&#13;
disbursement schedules and that sort of thing, but the whole formulation of the program, what's&#13;
&#13;
been included, that's all part of the Programs Department responsibility, we don't get involved in&#13;
&#13;
that." And I had quite an acrimonious discussion with David Knox saying, "Look, the Programs&#13;
&#13;
Department people know little or nothing about all the things we're talking about in Turkey in&#13;
&#13;
the structural adjustment lending program. It's focused very much on industry reform or fmancial -&#13;
&#13;
reform. The IDF [Industrial Development and Finance] Division in the Projects Department is&#13;
&#13;
the center of that. There's energy, there's the whole public investment reform issue, the&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                             - 22-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE)&#13;
&#13;
parastatal reform issue. These are sensitive Projects Department issues, and you've got to get&#13;
&#13;
involved in them." Structural adjustment lending operations are probably best run by an assistant&#13;
&#13;
director of a projects department. You've got to have someone who is senior because it's multi-&#13;
&#13;
sectoral. You've got to have someone who can work at a high level with the programs&#13;
&#13;
department, and therefore it's so important that assistant directors of projects departments be in&#13;
&#13;
charge. He rejected that, and to the best of my knowledge no structural adjustment lending&#13;
&#13;
program throughout the Bank has been headed up by anybody from the projects departments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I would not have expected much support from some of those Directors of projects&#13;
&#13;
departments who were engineers. People like (Syed Salar] Kirmani, for instance, my colleague as&#13;
&#13;
Projects Department Director when I was Programs Department Director in the East Asia&#13;
&#13;
region, a distinguished irrigation engineer. I wouldn't have expected him to be enthusiastic about&#13;
&#13;
structural adjustment lending, as he is used to thinking of my emphasis on policy as being&#13;
&#13;
irrelevant for the World Bank. So I could understand that; I didn't accept it but I could&#13;
&#13;
understand it. But not from David Knox. David Knox is an economist, and quite a distinguished&#13;
&#13;
Vice President now. I tell the David Knox story because it so much reflects the difficulty we had in&#13;
&#13;
the early years of getting even senior managers on the projects side to get on board in terms of the&#13;
&#13;
overwhelming importance of the sector analysis and the sector focus of structural adjustment&#13;
&#13;
lending, and therefore that percolated right down to their individual sector or division chiefs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    What was an important ingredient in this attempt to spread the word throughout the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
staff was a series of special one-week seminars out of town, Annapolis and elsewhere, that we set&#13;
&#13;
up for mainly operational staff on structural adjustment lending where once again I was always&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                             -23-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE)&#13;
&#13;
insistent that we had a large proportion of those attending coming from the projects side of the&#13;
&#13;
house, and particularly at a relatively senior level, by which I mean division chiefs, senior&#13;
&#13;
economists, assistant directors and the like. And I think all those were very, very useful in trying to&#13;
&#13;
broaden the a base of understanding and appreciation of the importance of structural adjustment&#13;
&#13;
lending. But it was much harder than I would have anticipated in advance to get this breadth of&#13;
&#13;
support for structural adjustment lending, particularly--and I keep getting back to this&#13;
&#13;
point--particularly from the projects side of the house. And without the deep involvement of the&#13;
&#13;
projects side of the house, then clearly policy-based lending, which has to be for agriculture&#13;
&#13;
policy, for industry policy, for energy policy, for infrastructure investment programs and the like,&#13;
&#13;
without the projects department involvement, structural adjustment lending would be very weak&#13;
&#13;
in terms of the Bank's analytical involvement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    On the programs side of the house, as I have indicated, there was much more enthusiasm&#13;
&#13;
because of the feeling that the countries needed money and they certainly needed policy reform.&#13;
&#13;
But there was a long educational process to go through, because it was surprising how difficult it&#13;
&#13;
was to get economists to move from economic analysis to program formulation. This had been&#13;
&#13;
my own experience as Director of Programs Departments in East Africa and East Asia. And&#13;
&#13;
unless you make that step, then clearly you can't start thinking in terms of policy-based lending.&#13;
&#13;
And so there was a lot of training and talking that had to be done with the programs department&#13;
&#13;
people, particularly the economists who were heading up the structural adjustment lending&#13;
&#13;
programs in particular countries; to get them to start formulating solutions. For example, getting&#13;
&#13;
the prices right in agriculture is a simple objective, but then to ask what precisely does this mean&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                              - 24-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(PLEASE]&#13;
&#13;
for export crops, food crops, what does it mean over time, what does it mean for food price&#13;
&#13;
policy, etcetera, to start getting staff to talk in terms of the precise formulation of programs is&#13;
&#13;
much more difficult. And so it was a long learning process not ouly for them but also for me of&#13;
&#13;
getting programs formulated. I clearly found it much easier in countries for which I had been&#13;
&#13;
previously responsible in East Africa and East Asia, countries like Korea, Thailand, Philippines,&#13;
&#13;
Kenya, Malawi, etcetera, than for countries where I had not had any exposure, such as Latin&#13;
&#13;
America and the Middle Eastern countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    But it took a lot of time, and much of my time in the first couple of years was taken up by&#13;
&#13;
long informal meetings in my office, working with one or two people concerned with programs in&#13;
&#13;
a particular country to help them move ahead from broad analysis to program formulation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    I suppose from the beginning I was excited about the move from project lending to policy-&#13;
&#13;
based lending on a systematic basis, which is what structural adjustment lending amounted to. It&#13;
&#13;
was this intellectual, emotional involvement that kept me going because I was convinced that this&#13;
&#13;
was the way ahead for the Bank; clearly it was my mission to convince others. So it was, as far as&#13;
&#13;
I was concerned, a very exciting period. Needless to say, I had many frustrations but from where&#13;
&#13;
I sit at this moment, when structural adjustment lending and other forms of policy-based lending&#13;
&#13;
such as sector lending now account for probably 25-30 percent, if not more, of Bank lending, I&#13;
&#13;
feel that those years 1980-1981, into 1982 when we were all learning how to do it, were very&#13;
&#13;
important years to provide the basis for the Bank to move ahead on a much broader scale with&#13;
&#13;
policy-based lending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    It is particularly important, of course, in countries with heavy debts, which is what Latin&#13;
&#13;
America is now fmding. It's interesting to me in retrospect to fmd&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                               -25-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE]&#13;
&#13;
David Knox, as Vice President of the Latin America region, having I don't know how much, but&#13;
&#13;
probably near 70-100 percent of his lending as policy-based lending, after our early discussions.&#13;
&#13;
Quite clearly, given my overwhelming interest in Sub-Saharan Africa in recent years, policy-&#13;
&#13;
focused lending is central to Africa. In fact, I think that it is interesting that it was the two&#13;
&#13;
African regions, East and West Africa regions, that probably moved most quickly, particularly&#13;
&#13;
projects staff, to structural adjustment lending and other forms of policy-based lending. I think&#13;
&#13;
that's easily explainable because projects people and loan officers found that they could get by&#13;
&#13;
with projects in many other countries. There are good projects to be fmanced, supervised; the&#13;
&#13;
Bank could disburse money. But in Africa so many of the projects were disasters, particularly&#13;
&#13;
those in agriculture, as the OED [Operations Evaluation Department] has indicated. In the end&#13;
&#13;
the projects department, the whole of the operational staff in the Africa region, realized that&#13;
&#13;
project lending didn't have a future. The present portfolio of projects contained a majority of&#13;
&#13;
failed projects, and the last thing most African countries needed was new projects. They needed&#13;
&#13;
money, they needed assistance, but they didn't need new projects. Previous projects needed&#13;
&#13;
rehabilitating, they weren't being maintained, etcetera, so it was really the two Africa regions that&#13;
&#13;
moved operationally much more towards policy-based lending at an early stage than most other&#13;
&#13;
regions simply because the future of project lending in Africa was far more problematic than in&#13;
&#13;
the other countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Now from the beginning of structural adjustment lending, collaboration with the Fund was,&#13;
&#13;
of course, of central importance. Part of the Board's objection to structural adjustment lending,&#13;
&#13;
which I've already referred to, was the argument that the Fund exists, governments have&#13;
&#13;
resources in the Fund which are drawable on demand as part of their reserves; why, therefore,&#13;
&#13;
should the Bank be making foreign exchange available when the Fund has money for quick&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                            - 26-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE)&#13;
&#13;
disbursement already sitting there? If we want to influence policy, we just have to make sure that&#13;
&#13;
IMF conditionality is more in tune with what we consider is important. The whole question of&#13;
&#13;
Fund-Bank collaboration became very central right from the beginning, and it was emphasized by&#13;
&#13;
the Board that collaboration with the Fund was absolutely essential as part of the structural&#13;
&#13;
adjustment lending program. Ernie Stem, of course, was primarily responsible for that, working&#13;
&#13;
with the Deputy Managing Director of the Fund, but he delegated to me the responsibility on a&#13;
&#13;
day-to-day basis that cooperation. On the Fund side, that responsibility was delegated on a day-&#13;
&#13;
to-day basis to Don Palmer, the senior advisor in the Exchange and Trade Relations Department&#13;
&#13;
of the IMF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Conceptually it was easy to see how the Fund and the Bank came together. In effect, what&#13;
&#13;
the Bank was saying was, look, we are typically as a Bank dealing with long-term development&#13;
&#13;
issues, population, education, infrastructure development. We have our 20, 30, 50 year, 100 year&#13;
&#13;
horizon with the Bank's perspective of development. But, given the conditions of the 1980s, the&#13;
&#13;
Bank argued that those longer-term concerns had to be seen in the context of the immediate and&#13;
&#13;
medium-term, difficulties of developing countries with rising oil prices, declines in commodity&#13;
&#13;
terms of trade, high interest rates, exclusion of many of them from markets such as the European&#13;
&#13;
Market, etcetera, general deterioration in the medium-term prospects of the developing&#13;
&#13;
countries. Therefore the Bank had to relate its longer-term concerns to the medium-term&#13;
&#13;
horizon, the medium-term, liability in particular being the balance of payments. In effect, the&#13;
&#13;
Bank was altering its focus, not forgetting the longer-term focus, but also bringing its focus down&#13;
&#13;
to the medium-term. Whereas the Fund for its part was moving its focus to the medium-term,&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                             -'1:7-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE]&#13;
&#13;
not doing away with short-term stablization but also looking to the medium-term. The&#13;
&#13;
introduction of the Extended Fund Facility, the EFF, was a reflection of that, a reflection of the&#13;
&#13;
fact that stabilization had to be seen not in a one-year horizon but as a medium-term problem.&#13;
&#13;
Therefore the Fund moved to the medium-term from a short-run concern, while the Bank moved&#13;
&#13;
to the medium-term from the long-run. We carne together in this middle ground of the medium-&#13;
&#13;
term.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    So conceptually you can say we were both covering the same ground. The Fund took on its&#13;
&#13;
primary responsibility in the macro field and for exchange rate adjustments, etcetera, discussing&#13;
&#13;
this with the Bank but really being the lead organization in negotiating programs. And so the&#13;
&#13;
Bank's role was to give a clean bill of health, in some sense, to the investment program or more&#13;
&#13;
generally to the government expenditure program in a country, and on that basis the Fund would&#13;
&#13;
move ahead. The Bank on its side saw its role in the medium-term as going beyond simply a&#13;
&#13;
review of the public investment, public expenditure program, into all the policy issues covered by&#13;
&#13;
structural adjustment lending, agriculture, industry, energy and infrastructure development. And&#13;
&#13;
consequently the Bank's responsibility was much wider. The Bank also felt that much more&#13;
&#13;
internalization within countries of all this policy analysis had to be ensured. It was no good just&#13;
&#13;
twisting a government's arm to do this, that, and the other this year. They had to get a&#13;
&#13;
commitment to make policy improvements over the five-year or longer horizon, and therefore&#13;
&#13;
policy reform had to be institutionalized, had to be internalized in a country, and this takes time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    And it's probably this time factor which is the most difficult to resolve in relationship with&#13;
&#13;
the Fund. The Fund moves quickly, typically because it's dealing with crisis situations and&#13;
&#13;
governments need money urgently and therefore the package has to be got together quickly. The&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                            - 28-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE]&#13;
&#13;
Fund moves on the major issues, including the macro policy, on some of the issues like pricing of&#13;
&#13;
export products, food subsidies, and things like that Within two or three months the Fund will&#13;
&#13;
have a program, will be disbursing money. The Bank's style is a much more leisurely one.&#13;
&#13;
Although in the disaster circumstances facing governments in 1980s, leisurely might sound a&#13;
&#13;
slightly peculiar word to use, nevertheless, there's much more concern in the Bank to ensure the&#13;
&#13;
programs are worked out in detail, that the governments know what they're committing&#13;
&#13;
themselves to. There is much more focus on institutional development to ensure that public&#13;
&#13;
investment programs, agriculture prices, will in fact be handled by the government itself better in&#13;
&#13;
the future; that public debt will be better managed in the future than in the past All this takes a&#13;
&#13;
long time. And so leisurely is not meant to convey that people were sitting back and doing&#13;
&#13;
nothing; they were on the contrary working hard. But there was much more of a feeling than in&#13;
&#13;
the Fund that there should be some assurance that the government was taking these matters&#13;
&#13;
seriously, and was taking deep remedial action. And if this meant an SAL operation would not&#13;
&#13;
go to the Board for another year, okay, so be it And so the whole culture of the Bank and the&#13;
&#13;
culture of the Fund were very difficult for forming a basis for coUaboration.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    The major problem of coUaboration with the Fund in this period was that the Bank was not&#13;
&#13;
doing the serious job it should have been doing on things within its own jurisdiction, most&#13;
&#13;
obviously public investment monitoring. If there is anything the Bank should be responsible for,&#13;
&#13;
it is monitoring the public investment program. When it came right down to it, we weren't&#13;
&#13;
monitoring public investment in hardly any country. And the Fund rightly criticized the Bank for&#13;
&#13;
not doing its homework on the most central of aU policy issues when monitoring public&#13;
&#13;
investment programs was clearly the Bank's responsibility. And yet at the same time, the Bank&#13;
&#13;
kept getting deeply involved in exchange rate issues and the Fund would say, look, these exchange&#13;
&#13;
rate issues are a Fund responsibility. JurisdictionaUy the Fund is responsible for the negotiation&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                              - 29-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
(PLEASE)&#13;
&#13;
of exchange rate issues. And this made it particularly difficult for myself, in a situation in which&#13;
&#13;
the Fund complained that we were taking issues away from them and virtually having negotiations&#13;
&#13;
with governments on exchange rates. Although we always denied this, in fact these discussions&#13;
&#13;
were going on in several places. But we were doing that in a situation in which we were not&#13;
&#13;
looking after what was clearly our responsibility, namely monitoring the investment program, and&#13;
&#13;
this was a constant cause of irritation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     I said before, coming from collaboration in the fiScal field, that it's made all the more&#13;
&#13;
difficult by the style of the Fund which is very aggressive, very patronizing toward the Bank. This&#13;
&#13;
was also made all the more difficult during the period 1980 to 1982 by the fact that my&#13;
&#13;
counterpart was Don Palmer, who probably reflected all the unfortunate style characteristics of&#13;
&#13;
the Fund more than any other personality that I have ever met in the Fund. So there were lots of&#13;
&#13;
difficulties. These came to a head over particular countries, but they also came to a head when&#13;
&#13;
we came, as we did annually, to prepare a report to the Board on structural adjustment lending&#13;
&#13;
and on collaboration with the Fund. This always caused a lot of difficulty because when it came&#13;
&#13;
to collaboration with the Fund, the Fund would come down very heavily on jurisdictional roles&#13;
&#13;
rather than on the development of a much more cooperative relationship between the Bank and&#13;
&#13;
the Fund. And it's this jurisdictional emphasis, as I say, this aggressively paternalistic attitude&#13;
&#13;
that the Fund has which has made and continues to make collaboration with the Fund extremely&#13;
&#13;
difficult.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     In my own book on the subject, The Hobbled Giant. I have a chapter on collaboration with&#13;
&#13;
the Fund. A lot of people have taken this up in a very positive way. I say in this chapter that&#13;
&amp;#12;PLEASE                                             -30-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
[PLEASE)&#13;
&#13;
there needs to be a much clearer determination between the Boards of the two institutions of&#13;
&#13;
which institution has the leading role in particular countries and particular tasks. And I would&#13;
&#13;
illustrate this by saying that quite obviously in something like a Mexican crisis of 1982, or the&#13;
&#13;
Brazilian crisis the Fund clearly has the responsibility and the Bank has to provide support. But&#13;
&#13;
in other cases, and I would illustrate this most obviously by Africa, Africa is par excellance a&#13;
&#13;
Bank responsibility. In Africa it is a question of deep development problems, where the Fund&#13;
&#13;
issues are of secondary importance. And in African countries I feel strongly that the Bank should&#13;
&#13;
be given the lead role and the Fund should be put in the supporting position. But that would be&#13;
&#13;
opposed by the Fund staff and its Board, I think, which continue to insist that the Fund it in all&#13;
&#13;
situations the senior of the two institutions and must always provide the leadership.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Well, that's some part of the story of structural adjustment lending.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: An interesting part, too. You're well aware there are other issues we want to&#13;
&#13;
discuss, but perhaps we should take them up in another session, or in Washington?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PLEASE: Excellent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ZIEGLER: Well, thank you very much, Mr. Please, this has been a very productive interview.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
PLEASE: I've enjoyed it. Thank you.&#13;
