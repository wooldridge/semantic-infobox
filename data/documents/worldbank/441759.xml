How Competition Delivers Positive&#13;
Results in Transport-A Case Study&#13;
Gines de Rus     In this case study the government is initially the monopoly supplier of travel and freight service-&#13;
by ferry, jetfoil, and airplane-between two islands. It then allows private operators to enter the&#13;
industry. The first new operator revolutionizes the market, setting off a chain of events that lead to&#13;
a fall in prices, enormous growth in the market, more varied and attractive services for passengers,&#13;
and more efficient freight services for business. The experience shows both the dramatic effect of&#13;
removing barriers to entry by new firms and how the different values consumers place on different&#13;
kinds of travel time can create market opportunities not foreseen in the typical demand elasticities&#13;
used by policy planners and forecasters.&#13;
