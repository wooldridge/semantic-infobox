This Training Manual is based on a training curriculum developed by&#13;
Mr. Kamal Kar, initiator of community-driven total sanitation in rural&#13;
areas. This curriculum has been through extensive field testing and our&#13;
sincere thanks to all members of village communities, who contributed&#13;
generously with their time and efforts to participate in discussions and&#13;
PRA exercises. In addition, both the curriculum and guidance notes have&#13;
been refined based on a series of policy discussions, workshops and&#13;
interactions with national, state and local governments and expert&#13;
practitioners in South Asia. The Training Manual was developed and&#13;
written through collaboration with WSPâ&#128;&#153;s partner resource agencies,&#13;
Knowledge Links and Feedback Ventures. The publication of this Manual&#13;
was supported by Ms. Vandana Mehra, Regional Communications&#13;

Introduction to Participatory Training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Key Messages&#13;
      â&#150;    Participatory training builds on the knowledge and experiences of participants, which is more&#13;
          conducive to adult learning than conventional training methodologies.&#13;
      â&#150;    Effective facilitators help participants to discover their own capacities, instead of directing or&#13;
          dominating the learning process.&#13;
      â&#150;    In a participatory training, new information appears continuously. Therefore, the training design&#13;
          must remain flexible to accommodate the expressed learning needs of the participants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Conventional vs. Participatory Training&#13;
Training should be viewed as a learning process which involves the creation and acquisition of&#13;
knowledge, awareness and skills. In the following table, the main differences between conventional&#13;
and participatory training methodologies are summarized.&#13;

     Why use Participatory Training?&#13;
Conventional training is not a very effective methodology for training adults as it ignores the integral&#13;
role that adults play in their own learning process. Adult learning is based on principles and conditions&#13;
that are different from the formal set of learning principles. The key principles of adult learning are&#13;
summarized below along with their implications for training in the form of a â&#128;&#152;facilitatorâ&#128;&#153;s checklistâ&#128;&#153;.&#13;
&#13;
    Principles of Adult Learning                          Facilitatorâ&#128;&#153;s Checklist&#13;
&#13;
    Adults are voluntary learners and will                â&#150;    Do you know why participants are attending?&#13;
    perform best when they have decided to                â&#150;    Has the selection of participants followed the&#13;
    attend a training session for a particular                checklist outlined in Attachment 1 of the&#13;
    reason.                                                   Trainerâ&#128;&#153;s Notes?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Adults learn best when the context of the             â&#150;    Have participants been asked to share their&#13;
    training is relevant to their own lives and               expectations and what they hope to achieve by&#13;
    experiences.                                              the end of the training program?&#13;
                                                          â&#150;    Do you have a system for guiding participants&#13;
                                                              whose expectations are not well matched to&#13;
                                                              yours or the groupâ&#128;&#153;s?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Adults have experience and can help each              â&#150;    What prior knowledge may trainees have about&#13;
    other learn through an atmosphere of                      the subject matter of training?&#13;
    sharing.                                              â&#150;    Will your training methods build upon and use&#13;
                                                              the ideas and skills of participants?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Adults learn best when they are actively              â&#150;    Does the training include regular opportunities&#13;
    involved.                                                 for feedback, reinforcement and practice?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     What makes a Good Facilitator?&#13;
Facilitation literally means to â&#128;&#152;make things easyâ&#128;&#153;.                      KNOWLEDGE&#13;
In a participatory workshop, the role of a                                For example,&#13;
facilitator is to make things easy by creating a            â&#128;¢ About   the subject matter of the&#13;
                                                              training&#13;
learning environment conducive to sharing ideas&#13;
                                                            â&#128;¢ About the local context&#13;
and experiences. To create this learning&#13;
environment, a facilitator does not have to be an&#13;
expert but needs to develop a broad base&#13;
in three main areas: knowledge, attitude         SKILLS                                          ATTITUDE&#13;
and skills. Some examples in each of             For example,             Facilitator           For example,&#13;
these areas are given in the figure.             â&#128;¢ Communicating                          â&#128;¢ Friendly and honest&#13;
                                                    effectively                                       â&#128;¢ Gender-sensitive&#13;
As with other walks of life, in facilitation                                                          â&#128;¢ Respectful of local&#13;
                                                  â&#128;¢ Responding to&#13;
too, practice is the key to success. The            group dynamics                                      norms&#13;
most effective facilitators work hard to          â&#128;¢ Administrative skills                             â&#128;¢ Impartial and fair&#13;

     Designing a Participatory Training Program&#13;
Here are seven basic steps for designing a participatory training program. These steps are not listed in&#13;
any particular order and many steps may be repeated more than once. It is important to remember that&#13;
since this is a participatory training, new information will appear continuously. Therefore, the training&#13;
design must remain flexible to accommodate the expressed learning needs of the participants.&#13;
&#13;
1.     Get support and commitment&#13;
       Before any training program can be started, support is needed, including staff, budget and&#13;
       logistics. Also required, during and after the program, is commitments from key decision makers to&#13;
       achieve the objectives of the training.&#13;
&#13;
2.     Identify learning needs&#13;
       This entails finding an answer to the question: why should this training program be conducted?&#13;
       A wide range of sources can be tapped to answer this question, e.g., learners themselves, others&#13;
       who know the learners, job requirements, and so on. Knowing learning needs accurately and&#13;
       precisely is crucial to determining the quality and effectiveness of the training program.&#13;
&#13;
3.     Interpreting training objectives&#13;
       Training objectives should be based on the identified learning needs and resources available to&#13;
       meet those needs. Some factors to be considered when setting training objectives are: potential&#13;
       and limits of training, background of the learners, needed competency or skills, and available&#13;
       resources (financial, administrative and logistical).&#13;
&#13;
4.     Select resource person(s)&#13;
       Select an overall coordinator to provide support for all aspects of program implementation, from&#13;
       initiating the design to evaluating participantsâ&#128;&#153; feedback. Training can be made more effective by&#13;
       working with another facilitator as it helps to share tasks and responsibilities during the training,&#13;
       e.g., explaining theory, setting up equipment, facilitating groupwork, assessing participantsâ&#128;&#153; energy&#13;
       levels and so on. Additional resource persons can also be invited as experts on specific topics.&#13;
&#13;
5.     Select participants and size of group&#13;
       Participants should be selected based on their interest and willingness to work on&#13;
       community-driven total sanitation. Care should be taken to ensure gender diversity and include&#13;
       people from different cultural, religious and locational backgrounds so as to prevent dominance of&#13;
       any one group. Group size should be based on best allocation of available resources.&#13;
&#13;
6.     Training content and methods&#13;
       Choice of content and methods depends on identified training needs and objectives, level of the&#13;
       learners, size of the group and resources available. A timetable for activities should be agreed with&#13;
       the group as a whole. Further, identify a few icebreakers to energize the group if you find that&#13;
       enthusiasm is dipping at any point during the training.&#13;
&#13;
7.     Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
       Participatory program design means that two-way communication is necessary to feed information&#13;
       back into the design at every step.&#13;

&#13;
     Suggested Structure of the Training Program&#13;
A suggested structure for the training program is as follows:&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;         Workshop opening and introductions: welcome participants and enable them to get to know&#13;
         each other and the facilitators.&#13;
â&#150;         Logistics: give information on boarding, lodging, venue facilities, travel arrangements and per&#13;
         diems, if any.&#13;
â&#150;         Setting norms: set ground rules so everyone has a shared understanding of how to work together.&#13;
â&#150;         Expectations: clarify participantsâ&#128;&#153; expectations from the workshop.&#13;
â&#150;         Objectives and schedule: outline the objectives, content and timings of the workshop. Although&#13;
         shared with participants at the start of the workshop, schedules are often flexible and changed to&#13;
         meet their needs and interests.&#13;
â&#150;         Energizers: helps participants to relax and lifts their energy and enthusiasm.&#13;
â&#150;         Presentations: give information on a particular topic or share experiences.&#13;
â&#150;         Group work: discussion in small groups makes the program lively and provides a quick overview&#13;
         of participantsâ&#128;&#153; views.&#13;
â&#150;         Fieldwork: enable participants to learn by practicing new skills.&#13;
â&#150;         Recaps: provide a summary (usually by participants at the start of each day) of what has been&#13;
         covered so far.&#13;
â&#150;         â&#128;&#152;Parking Lotâ&#128;&#153;: a sheet for participants to â&#128;&#152;parkâ&#128;&#153; i.e., stick or pin, issues that need to be covered&#13;
         but are not appropriate for that moment in the workshop.&#13;
â&#150;         Mood barometer: a sheet with three moods (can be â&#128;&#152;smiley facesâ&#128;&#153; with three different&#13;
         expressions, ranging from happy to normal to sad) where participants tick what they feel&#13;
         describes their attitude best at the end of each day.&#13;
â&#150;         Action plan: for participants to clarify what concrete steps they will take after the workshop to use&#13;
         the new skills and knowledge they have gained.&#13;
â&#150;         Workshop evaluation: enables participants to address the strengths and weaknesses of the&#13;
         workshop.&#13;
â&#150;         Facilitatorâ&#128;&#153;s debrief: to discuss â&#128;&#152;what workedâ&#128;&#153; and â&#128;&#152;what did not workâ&#128;&#153; in the program and identify&#13;
         improvements for the future.&#13;
&#13;

The Sanitation Challenge&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Key Messages&#13;
     â&#150;    Inadequate sanitation adversely impacts human well-being.&#13;
     â&#150;    In India, reported coverage of rural sanitation has registered an impressive increase since the&#13;
         launch of the Total Sanitation Campaign of the Government of India.&#13;
     â&#150;    However, we have a long way to go, and usage and sustainability need to be addressed along&#13;
         with scaling-up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     What is Sanitation?&#13;
Sanitation refers to interventions for the safe management and disposal of excreta, with the principal&#13;
safety mechanism being the separation of excreta from all future human contact. It includes both&#13;
hardware (e.g., latrines, sewers) and software (e.g., handwashing, regulation).&#13;
&#13;
     How does Poor Sanitation Impact Well-being?&#13;
Sanitation and health: poor sanitation is one of the key causes of diarrheal diseases, which take a&#13;
heavy toll of lives, especially childrenâ&#128;&#153;s lives, in developing countries. Most of the diseases that result&#13;
in diarrhea are spread by pathogens found in human excreta. These pathogens can enter the mouth&#13;
through a number of routes, as shown below in the â&#128;&#152;F-diagramâ&#128;&#153; of the fecal-oral transmission routes.&#13;

&#13;
Sanitation and human dignity: surveys have found that people value household latrines, more for&#13;
the resulting convenience, privacy, safety, prestige (e.g., families are ashamed when they cannot&#13;
offer guests proper toilet facilities) and aesthetic benefits (sight, odor), than for their health benefits&#13;
(Bruijne et al. 2007). The privacy afforded by adequate sanitation gives a sense of dignity to people,&#13;
especially women. In addition, school latrines have been proven to be linked with continued education&#13;
enrollment of teenage girls and young women, particularly at puberty (Government of Philippines&#13;
et al. 2005).&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation and the environment: improperly disposed human waste is a major polluter of rivers and&#13;
aquifers. This depletes waters of oxygen that is needed to sustain aquatic life. Investment in&#13;
sanitation can dramatically improve the quality of water bodies.&#13;
&#13;
Sanitation-related burden of disease and economic impact: sanitation remains one of the biggest&#13;
development challenges across developing countries. Consider these facts:&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;         Four out of 10 people in the world, 2.6 billion, lack access to adequate sanitation. South Asia has&#13;
         one of the lowest sanitation coverage rates at 36 percent.&#13;
â&#150;         Diarrheal diseases are the single biggest killer of children under five in poor countries&#13;
         (Water Aid 2006).&#13;
â&#150;         Illness and death linked to poor sanitation contributes to malnutrition, loss of productivity and has&#13;
         repercussions on the educational enrollment of children, especially girls.&#13;
&#13;
     Rural Sanitation in India&#13;
Open defecation is a traditional practice in rural India. This, combined with the low priority accorded to&#13;
rural sanitation programs in previous decades, meant that rural sanitation coverage was negligible in&#13;
1990 and grew at only 1 percent throughout the 1990s (Water Aid 2005). According to Census data,&#13;
only 21.9 percent of rural households owned latrines in 2001. To address this problem at scale, the&#13;
Government of India (GoI) initiated the Total Sanitation Campaign in 1999. Recent progress has&#13;
been good, with some surveys estimating that rural sanitation coverage has nearly doubled to about&#13;
40 percent in 2007 (GoI, pamphlet on Nirmal Gram Puraskar 2007). However, latrine usage remains&#13;
a concern. Sample surveys carried out by GoI assessment teams in 478 districts (under the&#13;
District-level Monitoring program) indicate that actual latrine usage is around 80 percent nationally,&#13;
with significant variation across and within states.&#13;
&#13;
The lack of safe sanitation and associated burden of disease take an immense toll of life in India.&#13;
Children are particularly vulnerable - India loses between 0.4 to 0.5 million children under five&#13;
years due to diarrhea. However, according to the Planning Commission (2002), â&#128;&#152;the data grossly&#13;
under-reports the true burden of [diarrheal] diseaseâ&#128;¦ Community studies indicate that every child&#13;
below five years of age has two to three episodes of diarrhea every year. This means millions of&#13;
cases of diarrhea occur every year, but only a small percentage of diarrheal diseases are reported&#13;
every year through routine surveillance systemsâ&#128;&#153; (Planning Commission 2002: 46).&#13;

Approaches to Rural Sanitation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Key Messages&#13;
      â&#150;      Despite significant investment in toilet construction, traditional sanitation programs have failed&#13;
            to motivate people to stop open defecation.&#13;
      â&#150;      By contrast, a community-driven total sanitation starts from the assumption that it is not just&#13;
            the availability of toilets, but motivating behavior change at the collective level to stop open&#13;
            defecation that is important for safe sanitation to take effect.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Traditional Approach to Sanitation:&#13;
     Confusing Means and Ends&#13;
Earlier, rural sanitation programs were based on the assumption&#13;
that people defecate in the open because they are too poor to&#13;
construct a toilet. Therefore, traditional rural sanitation programs&#13;
provided subsidies for identified poor families to construct toilets&#13;
of a specified design. This assumption was proved wrong&#13;
because open defecation is not a reflection of poverty but a&#13;
traditional practice, while safe sanitation is not a felt need.&#13;
Therefore, the key issues of motivating behavior change to end&#13;
open defecation and use of constructed toilets were not&#13;
addressed by the traditional approach to sanitation, leading to&#13;
its failure.&#13;
&#13;
Other key reasons for the failure of the traditional approach to&#13;
sanitation include:&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;          Negligible community participation.&#13;
â&#150;          Limited attention to hygiene education or school sanitation.&#13;
â&#150;          Promoted single standard design of latrines that was often of&#13;
          high cost relative to household incomes.&#13;
â&#150;          Latrine construction took place largely through coercion,&#13;
          often as an obligatory condition for access to development&#13;
          projects e.g., water supply schemes.&#13;
â&#150;          Offered relatively high hardware subsidies that could not be&#13;
          sustained by the Government or donor.&#13;
â&#150;          Was not effective in reaching the poorest members of&#13;
          communities.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     Community-driven Total Sanitation in Rural Areas&#13;
Community-driven total sanitation in rural areas was pioneered in 1999 by Village Education Resource&#13;
Centre and Water Aid in Bangladesh. Since then, this approach and its variants have spread within&#13;
Bangladesh and has been introduced in many countries in Asia and Africa. A participatory approach to&#13;
total sanitation contends that it is not just availability of toilets but changing the behavior of the&#13;
people at the collective level that is important for safe sanitation to take effect. In this approach,&#13;
through a process of participatory facilitation, community members analyze their own sanitation status,&#13;
including the extent of open defecation and the spread of fecal-oral contamination that adversely affects&#13;
each one of them. Once people are convinced about the need for sanitation, field experiences have shown&#13;
that communities construct latrines on their own at the household level, according to their own capacity,&#13;
and more importantly, use it regularly due to a strong sense of ownership. A community-driven approach&#13;
does not require high subsidies, but it does need greater understanding of the individual and collective&#13;
â&#128;&#152;triggersâ&#128;&#153; or factors that motivate people to change their perceptions about the need for safe sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
The shifts in mindsets and practices required by a participatory approach to total sanitation can be&#13;
summarized as:&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;       From teaching and educating to facilitating communitiesâ&#128;&#153; own analysis.&#13;
â&#150;       From â&#128;&#152;we must provide toiletsâ&#128;&#153; to â&#128;&#152;communities can do itâ&#128;&#153;.&#13;
â&#150;       From â&#128;&#152;we persuade and do itâ&#128;&#153; to â&#128;&#152;we motivate communities to take independent decisions&#13;
       and actionâ&#128;&#153;.&#13;
â&#150;       From top-down standard designs to bottom-up innovations (â&#128;&#152;they designâ&#128;&#153;).&#13;
â&#150;       From hardware support to supporting people and processes (adapted from Kar 2005).&#13;

     Experience with Community-driven Total Sanitation in India&#13;
India was the first country where community-driven total sanitation spread to from Bangladesh. An&#13;
exposure visit for senior bureaucrats and NGO representatives from India to villages in Bangladesh&#13;
that had successfully achieved total sanitation using participatory approaches was organized by&#13;
WSP-SA. Some key champions of a community-driven total sanitation emerged from that group. This&#13;
led to the organization of a state-level workshop by the Government of Maharashtra in which all&#13;
districts and several NGOs participated to discuss an appropriate approach to scaling up rural&#13;
sanitation. Based on the workshop, a state rural sanitation strategy emerged that articulated a focus&#13;
on collective outcomes, participation by local governments and triggering collective behavior change&#13;
with appropriate choices and incentives.&#13;
&#13;
Against this backdrop, community-driven total sanitation was piloted in two districts of Maharashtra in&#13;
2002. The pilots successfully demonstrated that such an approach can be implemented when&#13;
communities are mobilized at a collective level. In addition, an apparent roadblock to the success of&#13;
this approach â&#128;&#147; upfront hardware subsidies â&#128;&#147; was converted into an incentive to scale up the&#13;
approach by presenting it as a post-achievement cash reward to Gram Panchayats (local&#13;
governments) that had attained communitywide safe sanitation. The active participation of local&#13;
governments has been a crucial factor in scaling up a participatory approach to total sanitation and it&#13;
is hoped, also its long term sustainability in Maharashtra.&#13;
&#13;
Other Indian states have organized exposure visits to Maharashtra and are trying to replicate its&#13;
success with this approach. At the national level, the Government of India has introduced a fiscal&#13;
reward scheme â&#128;&#147; Nirmal Gram Puraskar (NGP, Clean Village Prize) â&#128;&#147; in 2003. The NGP seeks to&#13;
reward outcomes i.e., achievement by local governments of communitywide open defecation free&#13;
(ODF) status and successful management of solid and liquid waste, instead of providing upfront&#13;
hardware subsidy to identified below poverty line (BPL) families. This signals a policy shift from a&#13;
supply-driven to a demand-responsive approach which is a significant window of opportunity to&#13;
implement community-driven total sanitation at scale within the context of a national rural sanitation&#13;
program, the Total Sanitation Campaign (TSC). A brief description of the TSC and the NGP is&#13;
provided below.&#13;
&#13;
     Total Sanitation Campaign and Nirmal Gram Puraskar&#13;
The Government of India launched the Total Sanitation Campaign in 1999, under the restructured&#13;
Central Rural Sanitation Program (CRSP). TSC advocates a people-centered, participatory and&#13;
demand-driven approach. It is being implemented in a campaign mode, taking district as a unit with&#13;
significant involvement of local governments. Some of the key features of the TSC include:&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;       Shift from a high-subsidy to a low-subsidy regime.&#13;
â&#150;       Flexible menu of technology options.&#13;
â&#150;       Implementation in campaign mode.&#13;
â&#150;       IEC campaign to create demand for improved sanitation services.&#13;
â&#150;       Development of supply chain to meet the demand stimulated at the community level.&#13;
â&#150;       Shift from hardware subsidy to performance incentives through the â&#128;&#147; Nirmal Gram Puraskar.&#13;

 Nirmal Gram Puraskar&#13;
 To accelerate achievement of TSC objectives, the Government of India introduced the Nirmal&#13;
 Gram Puraskar in 2003. This is an incentive scheme that offers cash rewards to local governments&#13;
 that achieve 100 percent sanitation i.e., they are 100 percent ODF and have tackled liquid and&#13;
 solid waste management. The amount of incentive is based on population as shown below.&#13;

 Providing fiscal incentives to reward outcomes is a significant shift from the traditional approach to&#13;
 sanitation provision. The NGP scheme has elicited a tremendous response, with number of local&#13;
 governments awarded going up from a mere 40 in 2005 to nearly 5,000 in 2007. By providing&#13;
 incentives to community efforts to meet collective gains in sanitation, the scheme helps to raise the&#13;
 status of the winning village, create peer pressure among neighboring villages, and stiff competition&#13;
 among all tiers of governance within and across states.&#13;

GUIDANCE NOTE 4&#13;
Community-driven Total Sanitation: Key Principles&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Key Messages&#13;
     â&#150;    Community-driven total sanitation is a significant departure from the way that rural sanitation&#13;
         programs are usually implemented.&#13;
     â&#150;    The key principles can be summarized as follows:&#13;
         â&#128;&#147; Focus on outcomes rather than building toilets.&#13;
         â&#128;&#147; Focus on collective behavior change rather than mobilizing individual households.&#13;
         â&#128;&#147; Accommodate a variety of technological options to get people on the sanitation ladder.&#13;
         â&#128;&#147; Promote private suppliers/entrepreneurs to respond to demand.&#13;
         â&#128;&#147; Appropriate institutional frameworks are key to achieving scale and sustainability.&#13;
         â&#128;&#147; Focus on incentives that reward outcomes rather than provide upfront hardware subsidy.&#13;
&#13;
     Each of these principles is explained in detail below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Why Focus on Outcomes as Opposed to Latrine Construction?&#13;
Traditionally, rural sanitation programs measured success by counting the numbers of latrines&#13;
constructed in a given time frame. By contrast, community-driven total sanitation measures its&#13;
success on the basis of outcomes, i.e., achievement of communitywide open defecation free (ODF)&#13;
status. Latrine construction means little if open defecation continues alongside it because the&#13;
overall risk of bacteriological contamination remains high. Therefore, latrine construction is only&#13;
a means to an end, i.e., improved public health outcomes, but not an end in itself. For this reason,&#13;
community-driven total sanitation focuses on triggering collective behavior change to stop open&#13;
defecation rather than meet construction targets.&#13;
&#13;
     Why Focus on Collective rather than Individual Behavior Change?&#13;
Sanitation is a private practice that has public consequences. Therefore, public health benefits can be&#13;
achieved only by targeting the collective instead of focusing on motivating individual households to&#13;
construct toilets, as illustrated by the case study below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Community-driven Total Sanitation: Why Target Collective&#13;
     Behavior Change?&#13;
     A rapid assessment in Himachal Pradesh reveals that in villages with around 30 percent&#13;
     household toilet use, the incidence of diarrhea was reported as being around 40 percent.&#13;
     Even villages with 95 percent household toilets, still reported around 25 percent diarrheal&#13;
     incidence. Only open defecation free villages with 100 percent toilet usage have reported&#13;
     significant drop in diarrhea to less than 10%. In effect, even if a majority individual households&#13;
     switch to using toilets, the overall risk of bacteriological contamination and incidence of disease&#13;
     continues to be high.&#13;

&#13;
 Why Accommodate a Variety of Technological Options instead of&#13;
Prescribing a Single Latrine Model?&#13;
In the past, rural sanitation programs provided limited technology options. Decisions were made by&#13;
technical experts and handed down to community members, who typically contributed by providing&#13;
labor for the construction of a predecided design. This top-down approach, with no community&#13;
participation in decision-making, has proven unsustainable in India and elsewhere because toilets&#13;
built in this way were either not used or used for alternative purposes, e.g., storage. The lesson learnt&#13;
from this experience is that the choice of sanitation technology adopted has to come from the people&#13;
using the latrine.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, it has been observed that improvements in sanitation systems generally occur&#13;
incrementally rather than in a single leap (Cairncross and Feachem 1993). What is promoted in&#13;
community-driven total sanitation is a switch from open defecation to a safe yet affordable sanitation&#13;
option. While affordability is naturally determined by individual household circumstances, the availability&#13;
of relatively low-cost options particularly helps those who are uncertain about changing their habits to&#13;
get into the habit of using a toilet. The significance of the first relatively low-cost toilet is enormous in&#13;
terms of breaking the habit of open defecation (Kar 2005). Experience with community-driven total&#13;
sanitation shows that the users of relatively low-cost toilet models adopt upgrades or graduate to more&#13;
expensive models, using their own resources, when the design life of their first toilet is over.&#13;
&#13;
 What Role do Private Sanitation Demand and Suppliers Play in&#13;
Promoting a Total Sanitation Approach?&#13;
Obviously, if communities are upgrading their toilets, there will be a market for private&#13;
suppliers to sell sanitary goods and provide the required services. Thus, community-driven total&#13;
sanitation stimulates entrepreneurs to produce and market latrine hardware, such as different types&#13;
and grades of pans, rings and slabs. Field experience shows that in response to demand for&#13;
sanitation products and services, local innovations have resulted in a range of differently priced&#13;
products, and a spontaneous and competitive market has developed. Private suppliers have also&#13;
taken the initiative to undertake promotional activities for their business.&#13;
&#13;
 Why are Institutional Frameworks Key to Achieving Scale and&#13;
Sustainability?&#13;
Institutions matter and experience shows that Gram Panchayats (local governments) are ideally&#13;
placed to promote total sanitation in order to ensure public benefits and are well suited to address&#13;
the issue of scaling up due to their outreach and mandate. In addition, local governments are in a&#13;
good position to undertake or facilitate the long-term monitoring and support of rural sanitation services.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
NGO interventions have been successful in demonstrating the total sanitation approach but experience&#13;
shows that local government involvement in partnership with civil society organizations accelerates&#13;
scaling up.&#13;

      Community-driven Total Sanitation: Why do Institutions Matter?&#13;
      In 2003, prior to implementation of total sanitation program in Maharashtra, not even one Gram&#13;
      Panchayat had an open defecation free village or 100 percent sanitation coverage, while today,&#13;
      with the involvement of local governments in promotion of total sanitation, there are around&#13;
      1,974 Gram Panchayats (as of June 2007) which have received the Nirmal Gram Puraskar of&#13;
      the Government of India.&#13;

  Why does Community-driven Total Sanitation Support Incentives&#13;
to Reward Outcomes?&#13;
A key feature of the total sanitation approach is that it is not in favor of upfront hardware subsidy.&#13;
Experience with community-driven total sanitation shows that:&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;       Subsidy is not effective in creating demand for safe sanitation as people defecate in the open not&#13;
       because they canâ&#128;&#153;t afford latrines but because safe sanitation is not a felt need.&#13;
â&#150;       Subsidies raise community expectation of getting free money from outsiders and community&#13;
       initiative to change its own sanitation status takes a backseat.&#13;
â&#150;       The Government of India has spent huge amount of money on subsidies in the past two decades&#13;
       but around 80 percent of people in rural India continue to defecate in the open (2001 Census).&#13;
â&#150;       Stopping open defecation does not require large sums of money as there are a variety of&#13;
       affordable technological options available.&#13;
&#13;
Instead of giving upfront subsidies for the construction of latrines, providing incentives for&#13;
sanitary â&#128;&#152;outcomesâ&#128;&#153; has been found to be effective in achieving communitywide total sanitation.&#13;
Offering rewards (financial/nonfinancial) for communities that have completely ended the practice of&#13;
â&#128;&#152;open defecationâ&#128;&#153; empowers the collective to develop appropriate methods of addressing individual&#13;
and collective sanitary behavior change. The Nirmal Gram Puraskar of the Government of India&#13;
(see boxed item on Nirmal Gram Puraskar in Guidance Note 3) is an effective example to&#13;
demonstrate this point. Incentive schemes introduced by State governments also motivate local&#13;
governments and communities to achieve sanitation outcomes, e.g., the Sant Gadge Baba Gram&#13;
Swacchata Abhiyan introduced by the Government of Maharashtra.&#13;

     Incentive Schemes Introduced by State Governments&#13;
     The Government of Maharashtra launched a program popularly known as Sant Gadge Baba&#13;
     Gram Swacchata Abhiyan (SGBGSA), Rashtra Sant Tukdoji Maharaj Clean Village Competition&#13;
     (RSTMCVC) and Rashtrapita Mahatma Gandhi Competition (RMGC) for cleanest Zilla&#13;
     Panchayats and Panchayat Samitis in 2001. The Hagandhari Mukt Abhiyan (Open Defecation&#13;
     Free Campaign) was also launched subsequently in 2002. While the SGBGSA is a campaign&#13;
     with a prescribed calendar of activities and goals, the other two programs provide for financial&#13;
     rewards to Gram Panchayats, Panchayat Samitis and Zilla Parishads that perform relative to&#13;
     others. The competition is assessed in a transparent and impartial manner across 11 parameters&#13;
     and 105 subparameters. The assessment committee at different levels â&#128;&#147; ZP ward, PS, ZP,&#13;
     division and state â&#128;&#147; is constituted by a mix of personnel from administration, elected political&#13;
     leadership and professionals. The competition is an annual one with a panchayat having&#13;
     achieved 50 percent household sanitation free to enroll. The format follows a pattern of three&#13;
     winners at the Panchayat Samiti, competing to select three winners from the district, then the&#13;
     division and then the state. An outlay of Rs. 60 million is earmarked annually for this.&#13;

GUIDANCE NOTE 5&#13;
Triggering Behavior Change&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Key Messages&#13;
      â&#150;      Supply-driven approaches assume that if people are better informed, they will change&#13;
            their behavior.&#13;
      â&#150;      By contrast, community-driven total sanitation relies on the triggering approach which seeks to&#13;
            identify the triggers or factors that motivate people to change their behavior.&#13;
      â&#150;      Triggers can work on individuals or collectively, but the latter is more sustainable as it&#13;
            generates social pressure to prevent individuals from reverting to ingrained habits.&#13;
      â&#150;      Triggering can lead to four types of outcomes: matchbox in a gas station, flames under ash,&#13;
            spark, and damp matchbox. Each is briefly discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Toilet Construction-driven Approaches vs. Triggering&#13;
Traditionally, rural sanitation programs targeted individuals with predetermined messages focusing on&#13;
latrine construction without emphasizing why latrines should be used. By contrast, participatory total&#13;
sanitation relies on a triggering approach which tries to find locally relevant triggers or factors that can&#13;
be used to motivate behavior change in a community. The differences between conventional toilet&#13;
construction-driven approaches and triggering are detailed below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Toilet Construction-driven Approach                    Triggering Behavior Change&#13;
&#13;
    Assumes that if people are better educated             Seeks to â&#128;&#152;find outâ&#128;&#153; what causes people to change&#13;
    or informed, they will change their behavior.          their behavior.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Has a predetermined set of core                        Innovates to establish core messages driven by&#13;
    messages.                                              local factors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Has a predetermined approach of who does               Allows plenty of freedom as to â&#128;&#152;who does whatâ&#128;&#153; in&#13;
    what and how.                                          each particular context.&#13;

&#13;
     Types of Triggers&#13;
Triggers broadly fall into two categories: Individual and Community.&#13;
&#13;
     Individual Triggers&#13;
Some of the individual triggers related to sanitary behavior are:&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;          Dignity and privacy.&#13;
â&#150;          Shame (amongst women when â&#128;&#152;watchedâ&#128;&#153; by passers-by or among men â&#128;&#147; â&#128;&#152;how can you allow the&#13;
          women of your house to publicly defecate in the open when people may be watching?â&#128;&#153;).&#13;

&amp;#12;    Module 1: Guidance Notes                      Training of Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Manual on Community-driven Total Sanitation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;       Safety of children and elderly against falling down during rainy season or night-time.&#13;
â&#150;       Fear (of darkness, wild animals, loss of money due to medical expenses, etc.).&#13;
â&#150;       Prestige (when guests from urban areas visit, families feel embarrassed at being unable to&#13;
       provide adequate toilet facilities).&#13;
â&#150;       Convenience (for the elderly, infirm, pregnant ladies and children, during bad weather or sickness).&#13;
&#13;
Different individuals change behavior due to different reasons. However, behavior change triggered&#13;
by such individual reasons is often sustained only until the reason remains in existence, e.g., a family&#13;
that builds a household latrine because it is more convenient after dark, may continue to defecate in&#13;
the open during daytime. Therefore, behavior change triggered in this manner is partial and the risk of&#13;
fall-back is higher.&#13;
&#13;
     Community Triggers&#13;
Community triggers are factors or situations that concern and affect a community as a whole, thus&#13;
prompting every member within it to change a behavior that is collectively perceived as hazardous.&#13;
Some of the community triggers related to eliminating open defecation are:&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;       Health.&#13;
â&#150;       Water quality.&#13;
â&#150;       Prestige.&#13;
&#13;
When the community realizes that their health is at stake due to their own habit or the habit of others&#13;
to defecate in the open, the community collectively resolves to change its behavior. Once the process&#13;
is initiated, members begin to monitor each otherâ&#128;&#153;s behavior within the community. Thus, those who&#13;
have a tendency to â&#128;&#152;fall backâ&#128;&#153; are also prevented from doing so due to the social pressure created&#13;
after such a collective resolution. Behavior change, when triggered by such collective concerns or&#13;
situations, is more likely to be sustained.&#13;
&#13;
     What are the Expected Sources of the â&#128;&#152;Triggeringâ&#128;&#153; Process?&#13;
Outcomes of total sanitation triggering exercises can be classified into four broad categories.&#13;
These are:&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;       â&#128;&#152;Matchbox in a gas stationâ&#128;&#153; (petrol pump mein maachis): refers to a situation where everyone&#13;
       agrees to stop open defecation and start the action immediately.&#13;
â&#150;       â&#128;&#152;Fire under ashâ&#128;&#153; or â&#128;&#152;promising flamesâ&#128;&#153; (raakh ke neeche aag): is the situation where most of the&#13;
       people have agreed.&#13;
â&#150;       â&#128;&#152;Scattered sparksâ&#128;&#153; or â&#128;&#152;hopeâ&#128;&#153; (chingaari): is the situation where the majority is undecided, but few&#13;
       individuals in the community agree to act promptly.&#13;
â&#150;       â&#128;&#152;Damp matchboxâ&#128;&#153; (bheegi diya salai): is the situation where community-driven total sanitation&#13;
       exercises are not able to trigger any positive response at all.&#13;

GUIDANCE NOTE 6&#13;
Community-driven Total Sanitation: Toolbox&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Key Messages&#13;
      â&#150;      Effective facilitation is key to community-driven total sanitation.&#13;
      â&#150;      Tools to facilitate participatory total sanitation can be implemented in any sequence, provided a&#13;
            rapport has been established with the community.&#13;
      â&#150;      This note provides an overview of different tools, explaining the purpose and process guidelines&#13;
            on how to use these in the field. Where appropriate, â&#128;&#152;Doâ&#128;&#153;s and Donâ&#128;&#153;tsâ&#128;&#153; are included for facilitators.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Attitude of the Facilitator&#13;
According to Kar (2005), the key to success is the attitude and approach of the facilitator. At the&#13;
outset, it is important that the facilitator should understand his/her own motivation for undertaking the&#13;
task, his/her own perceptions toward sanitation and the type of relationship he/she has with the&#13;
people of the village. An unequal, superior-subordinate relationship will hinder rapport-building. The&#13;
facilitator must be convinced that people have the capacity to do it themselves, they just&#13;
require â&#128;&#152;facilitationâ&#128;&#153; to move in that direction. Therefore, the facilitator must never lecture or advise&#13;
on sanitation habits and should not prescribe toilet models, at least in the first instance. The aim of&#13;
facilitation is purely to help community members see for themselves that open defecation has&#13;
detrimental consequences and creates an unpleasant environment. It is then up to community&#13;
members to decide how to deal with the problem and to take action.&#13;
&#13;
     The Sequence of Steps&#13;
The diagram on the next page shows the rough sequence of steps which can be followed for triggering.&#13;
This is intended as a guide only and there is no prescribed â&#128;&#152;bestâ&#128;&#153; format. While it is advisable to&#13;
undertake rapport-building first, variations in terms of which sequence to follow these steps are not&#13;
only possible, they are recommended and should be based on the local conditions in which&#13;
triggering is undertaken. It is also not necessary to apply all the tools during interactions with the&#13;
community and the facilitator should be observant about the ignition moment. However, the â&#128;&#152;Doâ&#128;&#153;s and&#13;
Donâ&#128;&#153;tsâ&#128;&#153; are important.&#13;
&#13;
     Rapport-building&#13;
Purpose&#13;
Set the stage for subsequent activities by developing mutual trust, agreement and cooperation.&#13;
&#13;
Process Guidelines&#13;
â&#150;          Various techniques can be used to break the ice. You can begin with a simple self-introduction&#13;
          and begin a discussion with a few community members as you informally walk through a village.&#13;
â&#150;          To broach a private and sensitive topic like sanitation/defecation, sometimes directly hitting the&#13;
          issue helps, while at other times, the topic is best approached at after talking about the general&#13;
          cleanliness situation in the village.&#13;
â&#150;          Try to meet with as many people as possible and understand their perception of sanitation,&#13;
          defecating in the open, and how this affects their well-being.&#13;
â&#150;          Try to encourage women to share their experiences as they suffer the most because of poor&#13;
          sanitation but often lack an opportunity to voice their views.&#13;

     Defecation Area Transect/Walk of Shame&#13;
Purpose&#13;
To walk along with community members through the village, observing sanitary conditions including&#13;
open defecation areas, asking questions, and listening.&#13;
&#13;
Process Guidelines&#13;
â&#150;       After initial rapport-building, the facilitator can ask the group to show her the cleanest and dirtiest&#13;
       places in their village. Substantial time must be spent at both these locations to discuss why&#13;
       the group feels these locations to be cleanest or dirtiest. This helps understand popular&#13;
       perceptions related to clean and unclean in the community, giving useful clues to the facilitator to&#13;
       build further.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;&#152;Walk of Shameâ&#128;&#153; can be a Powerful Trigger&#13;
      A â&#128;&#152;walk of shameâ&#128;&#153; differs from other interactions with outsiders where the community generally&#13;
      projects a positive image. Going through the defecation area, walking among the feces and&#13;
      talking about the issues related to open defecation can have a lasting impact on people.&#13;
      Although they go every morning to this area to defecate, they do so without any thought for the&#13;
      reality in which this takes place. However, when they go as part of the transect with outsiders&#13;
      and the others of the village, they develop a sense of shame about the situation and often an&#13;
      immediate desire to change their sanitation status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;          Another way to do the walk could be the classical method to first take a round of the entire village,&#13;
          including the open spaces, and help the group observe general cleanliness conditions.&#13;
          Try to make the process interactive by asking questions such as those suggested in the&#13;
          following checklist.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Suggested Checklist of Questions&#13;
      â&#150;      Where do men, women, elderly and children of the village defecate? Visit and observe the area.&#13;
      â&#150;      Where and how is an infantâ&#128;&#153;s excreta disposed off?&#13;
      â&#150;      Where do people defecate at night?&#13;
      â&#150;      Where do people defecate during monsoons or winters?&#13;
      â&#150;      Where do we fetch our drinking water from?&#13;
      â&#150;      Where do people shower and wash their utensils?&#13;
      â&#150;      Is the area around our water sources clean?&#13;
      â&#150;      Are household toilets functional? Visit some houses with toilets during the walk.&#13;
      â&#150;      Are our lanes, agriculture fields and open areas of the village dirty or clean?&#13;
      â&#150;      Do we or our children defecate around water sources, forests, agriculture fields and in the&#13;
            backyard of the house during day or night?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;          Try to locate areas of open defecation and visit all the different types of latrines along the way&#13;
          (see observation checklist). When this is proposed, some people may be hesitant or even leave&#13;
          the group as they feel embarrassed to show outsiders the dirty spots of the village. However,&#13;
          since this is an important step, try to persuade these people to join in the transect.&#13;
â&#150;          Spend substantial time discussing in open defecation areas.&#13;
&#13;
      Doâ&#128;&#153;s                                                  Donâ&#128;&#153;ts&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
     Defecation Mapping&#13;
Purpose&#13;
To facilitate analysis of â&#128;&#152;big pictureâ&#128;&#153; with respect to the situation of the village vis-Ã -vis sanitation â&#128;&#147; this&#13;
exercise will enable community members to visualize defecation areas and the close proximity of&#13;
these areas to their homes.&#13;
&#13;
Process Guidelines&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
1.            First draw a boundary of the village with chalk/piece&#13;
              of brick. In case neither of these are available,&#13;
              wheat flour or a piece of coal can also be used for&#13;
              the purpose. The boundary could somewhat look&#13;
              like this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2.&#13;
              Ask community members to mark the main spots&#13;
              of their village â&#128;&#147; like school, temple, panchayat&#13;
              bhawan, Anganwadi, all water points like&#13;
              handpump, taps, well/with blue color powder.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.            Next, each member should plot their house within&#13;
              the boundary with the stones. Large stones (L)&#13;
              shall denote big puckka houses of rich people while&#13;
              small stones (S) shall denote kutchha houses&#13;
              belonging to poor families. The medium-size stones&#13;
              (M) should be used for average families which are&#13;
              neither very rich nor very poor. Alternatively, chalk&#13;
              could also be used for the purpose.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4.            Also, mark the agriculture fields and forest area by spreading leaves. After the houses&#13;
              have been marked, every member present should write the name of the head of the&#13;
              family or of self on a piece of paper and place it beneath the stone.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
5.            Now members who defecated in the open on the same morning would be asked to raise&#13;
              hands and then plot the location used for defecation with yellow colored powder. Once&#13;
              every member has marked his/her defecation site, arrows from the defecation sites to&#13;
              their houses would be drawn. Members would also be asked to locate the sites where&#13;
              children defecate (drains, etc.) or adults defecate during odd hours.&#13;

       large map in which lots of people can               facilitatorâ&#128;&#153;s role is to facilitate the&#13;
       participate.                                        mapping. You can encourage initially by&#13;
                                                           drawing a major landmark. After that, let&#13;
     â&#156;&#147; Encourage people to use local material&#13;
                                                           community members take over and&#13;
       for mapping â&#128;&#147; stones, sticks, leaves,&#13;
                                                           observe community dynamics â&#128;&#147; who is&#13;
       etc.&#13;
                                                           taking the lead? Who is being passive?&#13;
     â&#156;&#147; Ask questions about the map, e.g.,                  Which issues do people spend time&#13;
       which is the dirtiest neighborhood?                 discussing?&#13;
       Second dirtiest? And so on. The map is&#13;
       not an end in itself but a means to&#13;
       facilitate community understanding of&#13;
       their sanitary conditions.&#13;
     â&#156;&#147; Transfer the map to paper and try to&#13;
       have it displayed in a prominent place.&#13;
       The map can be used as a monitoring&#13;
       tool as the village progresses toward&#13;
       ODF status.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Calculation of Feces&#13;
Purpose&#13;
To quantify the magnitude of the sanitation problem.&#13;
&#13;
Process Guidelines&#13;
â&#150;       While the defecation transect and mapping exercises make people aware of the existence of the&#13;
       problem, the calculation of feces makes them realize the scale of the problem.&#13;
â&#150;       Taking an average of 250 gms (or local unit of measurement, e.g., tola/maund) of feces produced&#13;
       per person per day, the calculation first determines the amount for a day (250 gms X population of&#13;
       the village).&#13;
â&#150;       A daily figure can be multiplied to figure out how much feces is produced each week, month or&#13;
       year, which may run into tons. The quantum of human feces deposited in their area generally&#13;
       horrifies the community, an emotion which should be tapped. The analysis of where this feces&#13;
       goes has been described through a flow diagram.&#13;
&#13;
     Flow Diagram and Calculation of Medical Expenses&#13;
Purpose&#13;
To trace the routes by which feces defecated in the open makes its way back in to the communityâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
food and water, and the cost of treating diseases caused by ingesting feces.&#13;
&#13;
Process Guidelines&#13;
â&#150;       The calculation of feces should lead to further questions: where does all the fecal matter go?&#13;
â&#150;       Using a flow diagram, the movement of the feces after defecating is traced (this can be done on a&#13;
       chart paper, blackboard, etc.). The flow of feces will include its lifting in the dry state by wind,&#13;
       getting into the feet of chickens, pets, flies, mixing with water streams (especially during rains),&#13;
       etc. The idea that has to be gotten across is that the very feces that we have thoughtfully&#13;
       deposited away from us and our homes, doesnâ&#128;&#153;t go â&#128;&#152;awayâ&#128;&#153;. Instead, it makes its way back through&#13;
       these carriers.&#13;
â&#150;       The revelation that they have been ingesting feces in some form or other brings revulsion. Try to&#13;
       sustain the tempo here by asking related questions: how would the ingested feces affect our health?&#13;
&#13;
26&#13;
&amp;#12;    Module 1: Guidance Notes                           Training of Trainersâ&#128;&#153; Manual on Community-driven Total Sanitation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;       At this stage, the facilitator can ask community members to calculate spending on health&#13;
       expenses incurred due to ingesting feces. First, ask members to list out the diseases that can be&#13;
       caused by ingesting feces. Next, try to calculate the medical bill of treating a disease, say&#13;
       diarrhea, by estimating cost of travel to a clinic, doctorâ&#128;&#153;s fees, cost of medicines, cost of&#13;
       productive time lost, and so on.&#13;
â&#150;       This figure (medical expenses to treat diarrhea for one week) can be multiplied by estimated&#13;
       number of cases in a family in one year, and from there on multiplied by the number of families to&#13;
       calculate how much the village spends on medical expenses to treat one sanitation-related&#13;
       disease in a year.&#13;

       disease spreads â&#128;&#147; the way disease&#13;
       spreads, how people handle water and&#13;
       how it is linked to open defecation.&#13;

     Water Quality Testing with H2S Vials&#13;
&#13;
Purpose&#13;
To reveal the extent of bacteriological contamination of water sources due to open defecation.&#13;
&#13;
Process Guidelines&#13;
â&#150;       Testing with H2S vials is very simple and it reveals the extent of contamination of the water that&#13;
       people have been using for bathing, drinking, cooking, etc. This step is particularly useful in&#13;
       places where people defecate in the water (rivers, lakes, backwaters, etc.) and there may be less&#13;
       visual impact of doing a defecation transect/walk of shame.&#13;
â&#150;       Count the number of drinking water sources in the village including handpumps, wells, streams&#13;
       and taps, and arrange to get as many numbers of samples.&#13;
â&#150;       Take samples from surface water sources directly into the bottle. In case of groundwater sources,&#13;
       first fill water into a clean glass, and then transfer to the bottle for testing.&#13;
â&#150;       Check the samples after 24 hours. If the water turns black, that is a proxy for fecal contamination.&#13;
       If the water color is unchanged, wait for another 24 hours to confirm the test results. If the color&#13;
       does not change to black, it means the water is safe to drink.&#13;
â&#150;       Share the results of the test and tell families that are using contaminated water sources to use&#13;
       other sources or treat water before use.&#13;
â&#150;       Bury the vial safely in around 2 ft. deep pit after throwing away the contaminated water in the pit,&#13;
       and breaking the vial inside the pit and covering it with soil.&#13;
&#13;
    Doâ&#128;&#153;s                                                  Donâ&#128;&#153;ts&#13;
&#13;
    â&#156;&#147; Keep the H2S vial and bottle safely at              x Donâ&#128;&#153;t pass judgment on the community.&#13;
      recommended temperature and away                      Try to use the test results to help them&#13;
      from sunrays and children.                            analyze their sanitary conditions and impact&#13;
                                                            on their health.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Decision-making&#13;
Purpose&#13;
Ignition â&#128;&#147; to switch from facilitating analysis of the sanitation conditions to assessing whether the&#13;
community is ready to take action.&#13;
&#13;
Process Guidelines&#13;
â&#150;       At the end of the analysis, many in the group may actively want to change the situation. To tap&#13;
       into this motivation, the facilitator could ask: who will go for open defecation tomorrow? Or&#13;
       who will take a bath in the river in which everyone has been defecating? Ask them to raise&#13;
       their hands. If no one raises their hands, ask what can be done instead.&#13;
â&#150;       Usually, at this stage arguments run high between community members on how to stop open&#13;
       defecation. Donâ&#128;&#153;t interrupt or advise. If questions are addressed to you, you may tell them that as&#13;
       an outsider you donâ&#128;&#153;t know about the local situation and they would know best what to do. Tell&#13;
       them they are free to choose â&#128;&#147; they can even continue their age-old practice of open defecation!&#13;
â&#150;       If at this stage some people say that they are interested and are willing to construct toilets but it is&#13;
       costly and they would not be able to afford it, tell them it is not. Quickly draw a picture of simple&#13;
       pit latrine. Ask how much that would cost and how difficult it would be to construct a similar direct&#13;
       pit latrine? Let them know that this was not your design, but one developed by poor people in one&#13;
       of the poorest countries of the world (additional information on sanitation technologies is included&#13;
       in Guidance Note 6). You could also share experiences of other communities who have taken up&#13;
       total sanitation move and have achieved success.&#13;

      toilets or distribute subsidy. This                     technology. Remember, the central idea of&#13;
      perception about the high cost of                       community-driven total sanitation is to let the&#13;
      toilets is derived from supply-driven                   community decide, not prescribe.&#13;

                                                              them and tell them that you will record them&#13;

                                                              continue open defecation and eating one&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
     Action Planning&#13;
Purpose&#13;
To discuss three major next steps: (1) how to establish a Sanitation Action Committee; (2) create an&#13;
action plan and decide deadlines; and (3) decide actions for the next day.&#13;
&#13;
Process Guidelines&#13;
â&#150;       As a first step, it is necessary to have a steering and management committee which will oversee&#13;
       the completion of this process. This committee, to be set up at this meeting, can include PRI&#13;
       members and if it exists, members of an active Village Water and Sanitation Committee.&#13;
â&#150;       Next, decide on an action plan and approximate time frame to achieve the end of open defecation&#13;
       in the village. Discussions can be held on material availability, how to procure these, etc.&#13;
       The committee may also decide on whether any fines need to be imposed on those undertaking&#13;
       open defecation after a period of time.&#13;
â&#150;       Although the process of completely ending open defecation will take some time, it is necessary to start&#13;
       the first step toward that process immediately. Some actions that can be taken immediately are:&#13;
       â&#128;&#147; Digging pits to use as makeshift latrines.&#13;

GUIDANCE NOTE 7&#13;
Sanitation Technologies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Key Messages&#13;
      This note provides basic information about three aspects of sanitation technologies:&#13;
      â&#150;   Components of a toilet.&#13;
      â&#150;   Sanitation technology options and their relative merits.&#13;
      â&#150;   Factors that influence decision-making on sanitation technology options.&#13;
      â&#150;   Ways to adapt sanitation technologies to difficult conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Disclaimer&#13;
The total sanitation approach strongly discourages sharing any kind of information on sanitation&#13;
technologies with the community without an expressed demand from their side. Even if there is a demand&#13;
from the community for information on sanitation technologies, a facilitator should not prescribe models.&#13;
Instead, a facilitator should try to share general principles of design or technical parameters, e.g., distance&#13;
of latrine from water source or depth of pit.&#13;
&#13;
     Components of an On-site Sanitation System&#13;
On-site sanitation is a form of sanitation where human excreta are contained at the site of defecation in&#13;
a manner that is environmentally safe, hygienic and affords privacy. A basic form of on-site sanitation&#13;
comprises three building blocks:&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;          A substructure to isolate and contain excreta.&#13;
â&#150;          A platform with a squatting pan or hole.&#13;
â&#150;          A superstructure for privacy and protection from climatic factors.&#13;
&#13;
This basic form can be modified by adding features or components that facilitate hygiene, operation,&#13;
maintenance, esthetics or safety, e.g., a screened vent pipe can be installed for controlling smell and&#13;
flies, a water seal can be provided for odor control and improved esthetics, an additional pit can be&#13;
dug to increase the working life, and so on. Naturally, as features are added, the cost of a latrine goes&#13;
up. What is important is to see how effectively a sanitation facility helps individuals and the community&#13;
to break the habit of open defecation.&#13;
&#13;
The remainder of this section is devoted to a brief description of the basic components of a latrine.&#13;
&#13;
Latrine Substructure&#13;
A substructure should isolate and store excreta in a way that prevents harmful pathogens being carried&#13;
to a new host. A substructure can be a pit or a tank and these are described briefly below:&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;          In a dry pit, excreta comes in direct contact with the soil. This option has many drawbacks such&#13;
          as odor and insect nuisance and is generally not recommended for individual household&#13;
          application. However, if constructed on the outskirts of a place that is usually used for open&#13;
          defecation, this can be an entry level option for developing the habit of using a toilet.&#13;
â&#150;          In a leach pit, liquid and gas components of the excreta get absorbed by the soil through holes in&#13;
          the pit, while solids are decomposed into manure. It is preferable to line leach pits to prevent the&#13;
          walls from collapsing. Lining can be done with a honey-combed brick wall, perforated concrete&#13;
          rings, twigs, split bamboo matting, modified drum, stone masonry, etc.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;       A septic tank comprises a watertight settling tank with one or more chambers through which&#13;
       waste is deposited into the tank. This system does not decompose the wastes. The pathogen-rich&#13;
       sludge deposited inside the tank needs to be pumped out once the tank fills up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Differences between a Leach Pit and Septic Tank&#13;
    The differences between a septic tank and leach pit are summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
                                   Septic tank                              Leach pit&#13;
&#13;
    Cost                           High                                     Low&#13;
    Space Required                 More                                     Less&#13;
    Design Life                    10-20 years                              Varies, but around 3-5 years&#13;
    Time for Construction          7-10 days                                One day&#13;
    Sludge                         Unsafe                                   Safe&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Despite the differences between a leach pit and septic tank, it is important to note that a leach pit&#13;
    has lower initial cost and requires practically nil daily maintenance. The decomposed excreta&#13;
    becomes harmless biofertilizer and needs to be removed once in three to five years and not daily,&#13;
    making this advantageous from an environmental point of view. By contrast, wastes are not&#13;
    decomposed in a septic tank and need to be pumped out mechanically once the tank is full. The&#13;
    sludge deposited in the tank needs to be safely disposed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Latrine Platform with Squatting Pan or Hole&#13;
This is the floor of the latrine on&#13;
which the user sits to defecate.&#13;
The platform can be made of&#13;
various materials, e.g.,&#13;
concrete, bamboo, wood, etc. It&#13;
can have a squatting hole (pit&#13;
latrine) or pan (flush latrine)&#13;
fitted in it through which excreta&#13;
travels to the pit. There are&#13;
different types of pans used by&#13;
different people according to&#13;
their availability and affordability. The steeper the slope of the pan, the less water it needs for flushing.&#13;
Pans are made of various materials: ceramics, fibre-reinforced plastic, cement, etc. A pan can be&#13;
fitted with a water seal to prevent odor and improve esthetics.&#13;
&#13;
Superstructure&#13;
Superstructure is a room for housing the latrine. Its design is irrelevant to the operation of the latrine&#13;
but crucial to the acceptability of the latrine to the user, as it provides privacy and protection from&#13;
climatic factors. Superstructures range from a simple shelter of sacks or sticks to a building of bricks&#13;
or blocks which can cost more than the rest of the latrine! The choice of superstructure will reflect the&#13;
income, customs and preferences of the user.&#13;

     Shallow Pit/Cat Method&#13;
Description&#13;
Farm workers, seasonal laborers and migrants can dig a small hole&#13;
each time they defecate, and then cover the feces with soil. This is&#13;
known as the â&#128;&#152;cat methodâ&#128;&#153;. In addition, this can be used as a&#13;
temporary method immediately post-ignition in triggered communities.&#13;
In this option, excavated soil is heaped beside the pit and some is put&#13;
over the feces after each use. Decomposition in shallow pits is rapid&#13;
because of the large bacterial population in the topsoil.                               Source: Franceys et al. 1992.&#13;

     Unimproved Pit Latrine&#13;
Description&#13;
An unimproved pit latrine consists of a slab over a pit which may be 6.56 ft.&#13;
in depth. The slab should be firmly supported on all sides and raised above&#13;
the surrounding ground so that surface water cannot enter the pit. Sides of&#13;
the pit can be lined to prevent walls from collapsing. A squatting hole in the&#13;
slab is provided so that excreta fall directly into the pit. The pit, in most&#13;
cases, is designed to be used till it is filled up and then it is left to digest the&#13;
excreta. A separate pit is then dug and used for defecation.&#13;
                                                                                                    Source: Franceys et al. 1992.&#13;

     Ventilated Improved Pit Latrine&#13;
Description&#13;
Fly and odor nuisance in a simple pit latrine can be substantially&#13;
reduced if the pit is ventilated by a pipe extending above the&#13;
latrine roof, with fly-proof netting across the top. The inside of&#13;
the superstructure is kept dark. These incremental&#13;
improvements are sufficient to convert a simple pit latrine into a                                                    Air flow&#13;
ventilated improved pit (VIP) latrines.&#13;
&#13;
There are two types of VIP latrines: single pit and alternating pit.&#13;
For the latter, there are two adjacent pits below the toilet room&#13;
and one pit is used at any given time. When one pit becomes&#13;
full, it is sealed and the other pit is used. By the time the second&#13;
pit becomes full, the first has fully decomposed and its contents&#13;
can be used as manure. The pit is then emptied and returned to                      Source: Franceys et al. 1992.&#13;

     Pour Flush Latrine&#13;
Description&#13;
A pour flush latrine has a bowl with a water seal trap. Excreta is flushed down into the pit by pouring&#13;
water into the bowl. The water seal prevents flies, mosquitoes and odors from entering the latrine&#13;
from the pit. The pit can be under the latrine or may be offset from the latrine by providing a short&#13;
length of pipe or covered channel from the pan to the pit (see pictures).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
        Deciding Sanitation Options&#13;
Factors that influence decision-making on sanitation options can be divided into two types â&#128;&#147; demand&#13;
factors and technical factors.&#13;
&#13;
Demand factors relate to customs and socioeconomic conditions. They are crucial to the design and&#13;
acceptance of a sanitation option by a user and ultimately on the userâ&#128;&#153;s willingness to invest in and&#13;
use a facility. Examples of demand factors include:&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;         Affordability.&#13;
â&#150;         Social customs and traditions.&#13;
â&#150;         Personal hygiene practices (e.g., material used for anal cleansing).&#13;
â&#150;         Preparedness for emptying.&#13;
â&#150;         Preparedness for maintenance.&#13;
&#13;
Technical factors relate to physical parameters. They determine the feasibility of planning and&#13;
design, and ultimately the effectiveness of the chosen option. Examples of technical factors include:&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;         Availability of water.&#13;
â&#150;         Availability of space.&#13;
â&#150;         Level of groundwater table.&#13;
â&#150;         Soil permeability.&#13;
â&#150;         Risk of flooding.&#13;
&#13;
        Adapting Sanitation Technologies to Difficult Conditions&#13;
Lack of space is a problem and that is why people do not construct latrinesâ&#128;¦&#13;
Experience with community-driven total sanitation has shown that the reason why people donâ&#128;&#153;t adopt&#13;
safe sanitation is not due to lack of space but due to lack of a felt need at the collective level for safe&#13;
sanitation. Some innovative ways in which this issue has been tackled include:&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;         The latrine squatting slab and superstructure can be on the roof of the house but the pit can be&#13;
         under the main room of the house.&#13;
â&#150;         In many villages, latrines have been constructed on land donated by the Gram Panchayat or&#13;
         wealthy members of the community.&#13;
â&#150;         Two neighbors can have separate superstructure and squatting slabs but share a common pit.&#13;
â&#150;         Households which do not have adequate space in the house for building toilets can come together&#13;
         to construct community or group latrine facilities.&#13;

                        Shared toilet                                                 Internal toilet&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
There is a severe water problem in our block/district.&#13;
Community-driven total sanitation has worked even in drought-prone areas. Therefore, the issue&#13;
is not availability of water but lack of a felt need at the collective level for safe sanitation.&#13;
This is because:&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;       Using a toilet takes as much water as people use for anal cleansing when they defecate in the open.&#13;
â&#150;       Water use can be reduced by using other materials for anal cleansing, e.g., leaves, stones, paper.&#13;
â&#150;       The slope of the pan can be so designed that it uses minimal water.&#13;
â&#150;       Before defecating, pour a little water in the pan. This, along with the slope of the pan, will ensure&#13;
       that feces does not stick and also maintain cleanliness.&#13;
&#13;
What type of latrine can be built where there is hard rock close to the surface?&#13;
It can be difficult and costly to dig a pit where hard rock is close to the surface. Some strategies to&#13;
deal with this are:&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;       A raised pit latrine can be built where the pit is partially above the ground level.&#13;
â&#150;       Using the same concept as a raised pit latrine, mounds or platforms can be built whereby people&#13;
       defecate into drums or buckets and arrangements are made for safe disposal of the contents.&#13;
&#13;
What type of latrine can be built where there is a high water table?&#13;
If water table is high and groundwater is used for water supply, a number of solutions can be applied&#13;
to prevent contamination of groundwater, such as:&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;       Raised pit latrine: the bottom of the pit should be at least 4.92 ft. above the water table level. It&#13;
       is important to know how many people will be using the pit so that is can be sized accordingly.&#13;
       A large number of small capacity latrines, wide rather than deep, are preferable to fewer large&#13;
       capacity latrines.&#13;
â&#150;       Sand-enveloped pit latrine/raised pit latrine: a sand envelope can be constructed around a&#13;
       lined pit to reduce risk of groundwater pollution. This envelope is usually 1.64 ft. thick.&#13;

GUIDANCE NOTE 8&#13;
Sanitation Hygiene Practices&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      Key Messages&#13;
      Hygiene education is a potentially vast topic. To narrow the focus, this note details three&#13;
      hygiene practices:&#13;
      â&#150;   Washing hands with soap/ash after defecation and before eating.&#13;
      â&#150;   Washing hands with soap/ash after disposing an infantâ&#128;&#153;s feces.&#13;
      â&#150;   Proper and safe handling of drinking water.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Attitude of the Facilitator&#13;
Hygiene education is about helping people to understand, firstly, what causes some of their health&#13;
problems and, secondly, what preventive measures might be possible. It needs to be approached in a&#13;
sensitive manner, with a great deal of respect being shown to local beliefs, customs and practices.&#13;
Following the core beliefs of community-driven total sanitation, it is important not to preach to villagers&#13;
about the importance of hygiene and its health benefits. Instead, use the triggering approach. In&#13;
different communities, the trigger for hygiene behavior change will vary â&#128;&#147; some may be influenced by&#13;
the health argument, others by concepts of cleanliness, others by the messages bought home by&#13;
children from school, etc. While promoting the hygiene messages, the catalysts should identify&#13;
which type of intervention will trigger the community to adopt improved hygiene practices, and&#13;
practice it sustainably.&#13;
&#13;
     Focusing the Issue of Hygiene Education&#13;
Although there are various hygiene practices, it may be more practical to concentrate on a few of&#13;
them in the beginning. It is generally agreed that the three most important hygiene messages that&#13;
should be inculcated by the community should be:&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;       Washing hands with soap/ash after defecation and before meals: While mud creates friction on&#13;
       the hands and will assist in cleansing, ash and soap will kill/remove bacteria.&#13;
â&#150;       Washing hands with soap and ash after disposing an infantâ&#128;&#153;s feces: The popular perception that&#13;
       the feces of infants are harmless needs to be dispelled and greater precautions need to be&#13;
       exercised after handling babies.&#13;
â&#150;       Proper and safe handling of drinking water: Since a high proportion of the contamination of water&#13;
       occurs between the water collection point and consumption, the safe storage and handling of&#13;
       water is an important hygiene practice.&#13;
&#13;
Each of these hygiene practices are discussed in detail below.&#13;
&#13;
     Washing Hands after Defecation and Before Meals&#13;
Due to not washing hands or washing hands with mud or only water after defecation, feces get stuck&#13;
in the nails. On eating food with the same hands one can fall ill. So washing our hands properly after&#13;
defecation is very important. It is also equally important to wash our hands properly before eating to&#13;
make sure that there is no form of dirt on our fingers and nails.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
What is the proper way of washing hands?&#13;
Hands are believed to be washed properly only when there are no bacteria, pathogens or any other&#13;
dirt left on our fingers or in our nails after washing. For this, we need to wash our hands only with&#13;
SOAP and WATER or with fresh ASH and WATER.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Critical Times for Handwashing&#13;
We must NOT forget to wash our hands at following times:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Handwashing after defecation                               Handwashing after washing childâ&#128;&#153;s bottoms&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Safe Disposal of Infantâ&#128;&#153;s Feces&#13;
Why is it important to know where is an infantâ&#128;&#153;s feces thrown?&#13;
This is important because an infantâ&#128;&#153;s feces is known to have five times more pathogens than the&#13;
feces of an adult. So, casually throwing an infantâ&#128;&#153;s feces in the open is as dangerous as defecating in&#13;
the open and, in turn, it pollutes our water sources. It is, therefore, very necessary that an infantâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
feces is disposed in a safe manner.&#13;
&#13;
Which is a safe place to dispose an infantâ&#128;&#153;s feces?&#13;
A safe place to dispose of feces is a place where the feces cannot cause infection and contaminate&#13;
the water sources. A clean latrine is such a place. If a hygienic latrine is not available, a shallow pit&#13;
can be dug which is about 1.97 ft. wide and 2 ft. deep to dispose of an infantâ&#128;&#153;s feces. Care must be&#13;
taken that an infantâ&#128;&#153;s feces is disposed in such a way that:&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;       Feces are not exposed to other people or domestic animals.&#13;
â&#150;       Feces are not exposed to flies.&#13;
â&#150;       Feces are not moved or used as manure on the field before they have become harmless.&#13;
â&#150;       Feces should not drain through the soil into water supply sources.&#13;
&#13;
     Treatment, Handling and Storage of Drinking Water&#13;
Any of the following ways can be used to treat the water taken from a&#13;
polluted/unsafe source:&#13;
&#13;
Boiling&#13;
â&#150;    This is a safe and simple method of purifying/treating water for using before&#13;
    drinking and cooking.&#13;
â&#150;    Here, we need to boil the water collected for drinking for 15-20 minutes&#13;
    on stove, heater or gas.&#13;
â&#150;    Boiling kills the bacteria and other pathogens present in the water.&#13;
â&#150;    If possible, we should boil the water in the same container used for&#13;
    storing it.&#13;
&#13;
Home Filters&#13;
â&#150;   Many of us have seen the filters used in households removing the harmful particles from drinking&#13;
   water.&#13;
â&#150;   We can easily get this filter from the open market. While purchasing, we&#13;
   must make sure that it has an ISI mark on it.&#13;
â&#150;   There is a candle in the filter that removes bacteria found in drinking&#13;
   water. These filter candles have to be cleaned by scrubbing with a hand&#13;
   brush under running water and have to be boiled to remove the&#13;
   impurities/bacteria. At regular intervals, say&#13;
   six months, the filter candle needs to be replaced.&#13;
â&#150;   The filter has to be filled with water. Water can be used for drinking after&#13;
   one to two hours.&#13;
&#13;
Use of Chlorine Tablets&#13;
â&#150;   Store water in a clean container.&#13;
â&#150;   Drop chlorine tablets in the container. We can easily get these tablets from the Irrigation and&#13;
   Public Health (IPH) worker visiting our village or from the market. But we must ensure that we do&#13;
   not put more than 10 mg of chlorine tablets in a container of 20 liter capacity.&#13;
â&#150;   Use this water for drinking after two hours. Bacteria and germs present in the water shall be killed&#13;
   by this time.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     Safe Storage and Handling of Drinking Water&#13;
To ensure that our drinking water remains pure and fit for drinking, we need to follow the tips given below:&#13;
â&#150;         Clean the water container thoroughly before filling water in it.&#13;
â&#150;         Always cover the container after filling the water.&#13;
â&#150;         Do not allow own/childâ&#128;&#153;s hands to touch the water in the container.&#13;
â&#150;         Inside the kitchen/home, keep the water container on a raised platform, away from the reach of&#13;
         children or animals.&#13;
â&#150;         Use a ladle for taking out water from the container. Wash hands before using the ladle or pouring&#13;
         the water.&#13;

GUIDANCE NOTE 9&#13;
Participatory Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
     Key Messages&#13;
     â&#150;    Participatory monitoring helps overcome some of the limitations of conventional monitoring as&#13;
         it recognizes the key role that local people play in planning and managing their environment.&#13;
     â&#150;    The four main principles of participatory monitoring are: participation, negotiation, learning&#13;
         and flexibility.&#13;
     â&#150;    There are nine basic steps that can be followed to facilitate participatory monitoring in the context&#13;
         of community-driven total sanitation. These are described in this note.&#13;

     Conventional vs. Participatory Monitoring&#13;
Monitoring can be defined as the periodic and systematic measurement of variables and processes&#13;
over time. Conventional monitoring typically comprises external experts using standardized tools to&#13;
measure performance against predetermined hypotheses.&#13;
&#13;
Participatory monitoring emerged in response to the recognized limitations of the conventional&#13;
approach. By recognizing the key role that local people play in planning and managing their&#13;
environment, it offers new ways of assessing and learning from change that is closer to the&#13;
perspective of those directly affected by it. The key differences between conventional and&#13;
participatory monitoring are summarized below.&#13;

     Key Principles of Participatory Monitoring&#13;
Participatory monitoring should not be confused with using participatory techniques in a conventional&#13;
monitoring setting. It is a departure from the traditional approach and requires rethinking on not only&#13;
â&#128;&#152;whose reality counts,â&#128;&#153; but also â&#128;&#152;who counts realityâ&#128;&#153;.&#13;
&#13;
There are many different forms of participatory monitoring and early examples of its use date back to&#13;
the 1970s. However, four broad principles that define this approach can be articulated as follows:&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;       Participation: which means including those directly affected in collection, analysis and use of&#13;
       information.&#13;
â&#150;       Negotiation: this involves reaching a consensus on what to monitor, how often, which methods to&#13;
       use, what the data means, how findings will be shared and action taken.&#13;
â&#150;       Learning: participation and negotiation in monitoring leads to learning from change which forms&#13;
       the basis for further action.&#13;
â&#150;       Flexibility: since the numbers, roles and skills of both those affected by change and the&#13;
       environment in which change is situated changes over time, flexibility is necessary (IDS 1998).&#13;
&#13;
 Participatory Monitoring &amp; Evaluation in Community-driven&#13;
Total Sanitation&#13;
Here are nine basic steps that can be followed to design a participatory monitoring initiative in the&#13;
context of community-driven total sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                    Identify&#13;
                                                Sustaining&#13;
                                                                   possible&#13;
                                               the process&#13;
                                                                  participants&#13;
                            Using the&#13;
                           information                                                 Clarify objectives&#13;
                                                                                       and expectations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                      Collection and                                                             Define&#13;
                     analysis of data                                                           priorities&#13;
&#13;
                                   Decide&#13;
                                timing and             Agree on                  Identify&#13;
                                 frequency             methods                 indicators&#13;
                               of monitoring             and&#13;
                                                    responsibilities&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;       Identify possible participants: who should be involved and who wants to be involved? For the&#13;
       process to be participatory, different stakeholders need to be included and not just the most vocal&#13;
       or accessible community members.&#13;
â&#150;       Clarify objectives and expectations: this step helps to clarify why we are undertaking&#13;
       monitoring. Some of the reasons include:&#13;
       â&#128;&#147; To know if we are making progress toward our goal, e.g., ending open defecation.&#13;
&#13;
       â&#128;&#147; To learn from experience â&#128;&#147; are some pockets/areas performing better/worse than others? If&#13;
&#13;
          yes, why is there a difference in performance? Can good practices/ideas be replicated? What&#13;
          are the key challenges and how have these been tackled?&#13;
â&#150;       Define priorities: sanitation is a private behavior with public consequences. Therefore, the scope&#13;
       of issues that directly or indirectly impacts is potentially vast. However, for monitoring to be&#13;
       effective, it is essential to narrow down the scope to selected priorities. This must be agreed upon&#13;
       by the community members, taking the local context as well as resources available for monitoring&#13;
       into consideration.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;       Identify indicators: this is often the most difficult step as each objective can be measured by&#13;
       different indicators. A thumb rule for selecting indicators that will provide information needed is&#13;
       that they should be SMART i.e., Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Relevant and Timely.&#13;
       In the past, the most common metric used by sanitation programs was the number of latrines&#13;
       built. However, field experience has shown that construction of toilets must not be confused with&#13;
       usage of sanitation facilities. Therefore, under community-driven total sanitation, the focus is on&#13;
       facilitating behavior change at the community level toward ending open defecation. Under this&#13;
       approach, constructing toilets is a means to an end, but not an end in itself. Accordingly, the focus&#13;
       of monitoring should be on the outcome (ending open defecation) and not on inputs&#13;
       (toilet construction).&#13;
â&#150;       Agree on methods and responsibilities: there is a vast variety of methods and tools that can be&#13;
       used for monitoring (Pasteur &amp; Blauert 2000). In fact, many trigger tools can be adapted for this&#13;
       purpose, e.g., transect/walk, defecation mapping and flow diagrams. Some methods and their&#13;
       applications are discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      â&#150;    Mapping: to show the location and types of changes taking place in the area being monitored.&#13;
          An innovative way to monitor is to combine a social map/list of households with tricolored&#13;
          bindis or pins to flag the sanitation status of each household or group in an area. This map&#13;
          should be kept in a public place so that it is visible to all and it should be regularly updated.&#13;
      â&#150;    Venn diagrams: to show changes in relationships between groups, institutions, and individuals.&#13;
      â&#150;    Flow diagrams: to show direct and indirect impacts of changes, and to relate them to&#13;
          causes.&#13;
      â&#150;    Diaries: to describe changes in the lives of individuals or groups.&#13;
      â&#150;    Photographs: to depict changes through a sequence of images.&#13;
      â&#150;    Matrix scoring: to compare peopleâ&#128;&#153;s preferences for a set of options or outcomes.&#13;
      â&#150;    Network diagrams: to show changes in the type and degree of contact between people&#13;
          and services.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In addition to the methods used for monitoring, it is important to decide responsibilities for monitoring.&#13;
One way to do this is to ask community members to volunteer for membership of sanitation&#13;
monitoring committees. Separate committees can be set up for different parts of the village, based on&#13;
recognized administrative divisions or number of households, e.g., each committee of five members is&#13;
responsible for monitoring the sanitation status of a cluster of 30-35 households. Members of these&#13;
committees can be youths, mothers, children or residents of a particular section of the village. The&#13;
committees can meet on a monthly basis or nominate a member to represent the progress in their&#13;
area to the Sarpanch or community leader responsible for the communityâ&#128;&#153;s sanitation status. It is&#13;
important to note that participatory monitoring does not exclude the role of government or civil society&#13;
organizations. Rather, successful initiatives demonstrate partnerships between communities and both&#13;
government and nongovernmental organizations.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
â&#150;         Decide the timing and frequency of monitoring: certain indicators are best measured at key&#13;
         moments or are heavily influenced by seasonality, e.g., incidence of open defecation may&#13;
         increase/decrease depending on time of day or season. To avoid confusion, those responsible for&#13;
         monitoring must agree on the timing and frequency of monitoring, possibly in the form of a&#13;
         daily/weekly/monthly calendar.&#13;
â&#150;         Collection and analysis of data: after the data is collected, it needs to be analyzed and shared&#13;
         with relevant people and groups. Consideration should be given to building the capacity of&#13;
         selected resource persons from the community such that they are confident of undertaking the&#13;
         analysis as per the standards required. Based on the analysis, the community should be able to&#13;
         understand and take decisions about:&#13;
         â&#128;&#147; What progress has been made?&#13;
         â&#128;&#147; What is working well?&#13;
         â&#128;&#147; What is not working well?&#13;
         â&#128;&#147; What more needs to be done?&#13;
â&#150;         Using the information: the same data and analysis may need to be presented in different&#13;
         ways to convey key messages to different groups. It should be used by each relevant group in the&#13;
         decision-making process to solve problems and/or plan for the future.&#13;
â&#150;         Sustaining participatory monitoring: to be sustainable, participatory monitoring must overcome&#13;
         certain common mistakes. These include:&#13;
         â&#128;&#147; Assuming that everyone will have equal enthusiasm to participate.&#13;
         â&#128;&#147; Imposing inappropriate indicators without adequate consultation or collecting unnecessary&#13;
             information.&#13;
         â&#128;&#147; Being unclear about how the information will be used and by whom.&#13;
         â&#128;&#147; Launching into the process with inadequate preparation (adapted from IDS 1998).&#13;

            This Training Manual is to be used by
            resource agencies engaged in training potential master
            trainers to facilitate and scale up community-driven total
            sanitation. It comprises three interlinked modules, the
            details of which are as follows: Guidance Notes (Volume 1)
            facilitates understanding of key concepts of
            community-driven total sanitation. There are nine Guidance
            Notes covering topics such as facilitating participatory
            training, principles and practices of community-driven total
            sanitation, sanitation technologies, hygiene practices, and
            monitoring.  Trainers&#146; Notes (Volume 2) provides curricula
            and guidance to trainers on how to facilitate a five-day
            Training of Trainers&#146; Program on community-driven total
