Abstract&#13;
This Paper analyzes recent trends in world food production and con-&#13;
sumption with special reference to developing countries. It continues by&#13;
outlining the World Bank's approach to projections of food production and&#13;
consumption providing results to the year 1995. It is shown that levels of&#13;
consumption of various food items have improved in developing countries and&#13;
are expected to continue to improve. Moreover, the results indicate favorable&#13;
prospects for food production in developing countries. The paper comments&#13;
throughout on areas whe;re further work is required to refine the projection&#13;
method and qualifies the generally optimistic outlook by identiEying the types&#13;
of actions that will be needed to accelerate food consumption and production&#13;
in developing countries. Pricing policies in agriculture are seen as being&#13;
particularly critical to the optimal development of the agricultural system in&#13;

PROSPECTS FOR FOOD P'RODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION IN DEVELOPINC COUNTRIES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Introduction&#13;
1.       The available evidence indicates that, in aggregate, the growth in&#13;
world food production over the past two decades has more than kept pace with&#13;
the growth in population. Improvements in per capita consumpt:ion among the&#13;
developing countries have been widespread. The important exceptions have&#13;
included many of the countries of sub-Saharan Africa. Associated with this&#13;
improvement has been the adoption and success of improved technologies,&#13;
increased investment in infrastructure vital to increased agricultural pro-&#13;
duction and, for some countries, a diminishing of the price distortions which&#13;
have disadvantaged agricultural production. Substantial production increases&#13;
have been recorded particularly in the case of rice and wheat, leading to&#13;
declining actual and expected prices for grains.&#13;
2.       We believe it is likely that these improvements in food availability&#13;
in the developing countries will continue, but that any such improvements&#13;
would be considerably erthanced by widespread adoption in developing countries&#13;
of pricing policies which remove the existing distortions under which&#13;
agricultural production labors.&#13;
3.       In this paper we illustrate the changes that have occurred in food&#13;
consumption in developing countries over the past 20'years and compare them to&#13;
changes in the industrial countries. We then present the forecasts of food&#13;
consumption growth which have recently been assembled in the World Bank and&#13;
briefly outline their implications for per capita consumption, production and&#13;
prices in developing cotntries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4.       We are not directly concerned here with the question of hunger,&#13;
whether chronic or periodic. We agree with the view that hunger is not&#13;
directly related to the level of world food availability, but is more a ques-&#13;
tion of income level, or as Sen puts it, the "entitlement" to sufficient&#13;
resources to purchase enough food to live. The many studies which the World&#13;
Bank for one has done on the cost effectiveness of programs to meet chronic&#13;
hunger among specific groups and periodic hunger due to sharp reductions in&#13;
food supplies have recently been summarized by Reutlinger, (1981/82).&#13;
Historical Growth of Income and Food Consumption&#13;
5.       The last 20 years has been a period of substantial growth for some&#13;
developing countries. The concentration of this growth can be shown as&#13;
follows: of the 68 developing countries (World Bank definition) for which&#13;
there are purchasing-power-parity (PPP) estimatesl/ of GDP/capita available,&#13;
only 19 countries recorded GDP/capita growth, in real terms, in excess of 2%&#13;
p.a. for both the 1960-70 decade and the period 1970-79. 2/ There are no PPP&#13;
estimates available for them, but to this list should probably be added Hong&#13;
Kong, Republic of Korea, Singapore and perhaps the Peoples' Republic of China.&#13;
1/ Purchasing-power-parity estimates of national income, (i.e., estimated in&#13;
terms of a set of international prices) are preferred to traditional&#13;
exchange rate adjusted GDP estimates because they better reflect the pur-&#13;
chasing power of income in each country. The PPP estimates flow from the&#13;
United Nations/World Bank project on International Comparisons of Real&#13;
Product carried out by Irving Kravis, et. al.&#13;
2/ The countries are: Barbados, Brazil, Costa Rica, Cyprus, Egypt, Gabon,&#13;
Guatemala, Indonesia, Iraq, Malaysia, Malta, Nigeria, Portugal, Sri Lanka,&#13;
Saudi Arabia, Thailand, Tunisia, Turkey and Yugoslavia.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
Of this group of 68 developing countries, another 15 recorded GDP/capita&#13;
growth in excess of 2% p.a. for the 1970-79 period only. 1/ By comparison, of&#13;
the 23 industrial countrLes for which similar national income data are avail-&#13;
able only seven countries (Australia, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand,&#13;
Sweden, Switzerland and United Kingdom) did not grow at rates in excess of 2%&#13;
p.a. for either one of these two periods, and only New Zealand grew at less&#13;
than 2% p.a. for both periods. 2/&#13;
6.       How has this growth, or lack of growth, of the per capita incomes of&#13;
developing countries affected food consumption in those countries? To give a&#13;
broad picture of the impact, growth in per capita calorie consumption of all&#13;
foodstuffs has been plotted against growth in income (PPP) for the developing&#13;
countries in Figures 1 and 2. In Figure 1 each developing cotntry-s average&#13;
income/capita growth for the 1960-70 period is plotted against its growth rate&#13;
of total per capita calorie consumption for the period 1963-70 (end-point&#13;
growth estimates). In Figure 2 income/capita growth for the period 1970-79 is&#13;
plotted against calorie growth for the period 1970-77. 3/ In using this&#13;
measure of improvements in food consumption we recognize the difficulties&#13;
1/  The   countries  are:  Algeria,   Bolivia,   Cameroon,  Colombia,  Dominican&#13;
Republic,   Ecuador,    Gambia,   Kenya,   Mauritius,   Mbrocco,   Paraguay,&#13;
Philippines, Sudan, Surinam, and Trinidad and Tobago.&#13;
2/ The industrial country group includes Greece, Israel and Spain--countries&#13;
that have until recently been classified as developing countries.&#13;
3/ Fbr calorie consumption, the periods 1963-70 and 1970-77 are the closest&#13;
approximations we can get, given the available data, to the decades of the&#13;
1960s and 1970s. Tle figures for calorie consumption in 1963 are the&#13;
averages of the years 1961 to 1965 while the figures for 1970 and 1977 are&#13;
the averages of the three years about these mid-points. The data on per&#13;
capita calorie consumption are taken from FAQ, 1980.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

associated with the measurement of "adequate" diets. 1/ All that is being&#13;
implied in our use is that at these levels of food consumption, growth in&#13;
calorie consumption does represent an improvement in living standards.&#13;
7.       In Figures 1 and 2 the north-east quadrant represents an increase in&#13;
both per capita income and food consumption. The south-west quadrant repre-&#13;
sents a decline in both. There is a positive correlation between per capita&#13;
income and food consumption growth in both periods. In the 1960s all but four&#13;
of this group of developing countries registered growth in income/capita,&#13;
while eight registered a decline in per capita food consumption. When a&#13;
country at these levels of food consumption registers growth in per capita&#13;
income but declining per capita food consumption, as most of these eight did,&#13;
the answer must lie in the shape of the income distribution of the new income&#13;
generated (i.e., it is so unevenly distributed in favor of the already wealthy&#13;
that demand for food is affected little) or in the food-pricing policies of&#13;
the country (i.e., relative prices are so distorted that food consumption is&#13;
seriously disadvantaged).Fbur of those countries which had declining food&#13;
consumption in the 1960s (Algeria, Colombia, Guyana, and Upper Volta) were&#13;
able to reverse the situation in the 1970s--even though in the case of Guyana&#13;
and Upper Volta they experienced declining income/capita in the latter period.&#13;
India, the Ivory Coast, Niger and Nigeria, along with many others, suffered&#13;
declining food/capita levels in the second period. In this latter period there'&#13;

seems to have been a worsening of the factors which have led to the countries&#13;
appearing in the south-east quadrant. 1/&#13;
8.        The obvious dLfference in the developing countries       performance in&#13;
the two time periods is that the 1970s gave rise to much more dispersed&#13;
behavior than the 1960s. The increased number of countries registering lower&#13;
per capita incomes in the 1970s explains part of this dispersion; with the&#13;
countries in the north-west quadrant more likely to be t;hose with food&#13;
policies favoring low-income consumers than those countries in the south-west&#13;
quadrant. Increased agricultural instability in the 1970s together with&#13;
pricing policies descriminating against agricultural production are likely&#13;
causes of the large number of countries in the south-east quadrant. 2/&#13;
1/ We tried, without success, to explain these differences in performance in&#13;
terms of income distribution and relative price distortion measures. To&#13;
measure distortions in consumer prices nominal protection coefficients on&#13;
grains production, which measure the distortions in producer prices, were&#13;
assembled for 18 of these countries. Nominal protection coefficients are&#13;
probably not a gocid measure of distortions in consumer prices, but no&#13;
other measures are available. Gini coefficients were used as one measure&#13;
of income distribution. These are available for about 30 oE these develop-&#13;
ing countries. Like the nominal protection coefficients the Gini coeffi-&#13;
cients have been estimated at different periods of time over the last two&#13;
decades. Further, t:he quality of the data on which they have been esti-&#13;
mated is extremely varied. Neither of these variables could explain any of&#13;
the variation in equations in which the growth of calorie consumption was&#13;
to be explained by the growth of per capita income, the level of per&#13;
capita income, income distribution and distortions in consumer prices.&#13;
Life expectancy in 1960 and 1980 was tried as a proxy for income distribu-&#13;
tion, but it also gave insignificant results. The results for this last&#13;
equation were as follows:&#13;
C = 0.17 Y + 0.003 LE + 0.0003 YCAP, R2(adj) = 0.42&#13;
(4.5)      (0.12)     (3.0)&#13;
t statistics are in parentheses&#13;
Fbr this equation the observations for both periods were combined; also,&#13;
the constant is constrained to zero.&#13;
2/ Barr shows that the variability of world food production was higher in the&#13;
1960s than in the 1950s and higher again in the 1970s.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
Reutlinger has shown that, in the face of reductions in domestic production,&#13;
developing countries have been unwilling to compensate for the shortfall by&#13;
increasing food imports. Therefore, artificially low food prices in developing&#13;
countries (a widespread practice,often aimed at the politically more powerful&#13;
urban consumers) do not necessarily mean increased consumption. Besides the&#13;
restriction on imports, artificially low producer prices (also a widespread&#13;
practice, particularly in African countries) mean lower incomes and hence&#13;
lower consumption in the rural areas--where most of the population and most of&#13;
the poor often reside.&#13;
9.       To give an idea of what these changes in food consumption have meant&#13;
in aggregate terms for the developing countries we have constructed Table 1.&#13;
These figures show the improvement in per capita food supplies in the&#13;
developed and developing market economies (FAO definition) over the period&#13;
between 1961-65 (average) and 1977 and the sources of the calories and protein&#13;
consumed. Over this approximately 15-year period the per capita consumption of&#13;
calories in developing countries has increased by 4.1% and the consumption of&#13;
protein by 2.8%. 1/ Both in absolute and percentage terms the developed market&#13;
economies have done much better--with per capita calorie consumption increas-&#13;
ing by 6% and per capita protein consumption increasing by 7.6%. During this&#13;
period food production actually increased more slowly in industrial countries&#13;
than in developing countries, but their rate of population increase was much&#13;
slower than that of developing countries, giving rise to the higher per capita&#13;
gains. 2/&#13;

10.      When examined in terms of the sources of these food supplies there&#13;
have been some marked changes for some food categories and for others a dis-&#13;
appointing lack of change. While the total per capita direct supply of calo-&#13;
ries and protein obtained from the cereals group by people in developing&#13;
countries has increased slightly over the period, there have been sharp&#13;
changes for individual cereals. The amount of wheat consumed directly, mea-&#13;
sured in terms of calories, increased by 28% while the per capita calorie&#13;
supply of millet and sorghum fell by 16%. On a geographical basis the regions&#13;
responsible for these changes were Africa and Asia. In per capita terms wheat&#13;
consumption rose by 44% in Asian countries and by 32% in African countries.&#13;
Millet and sorghum consumption fell by 11% in Asian countries and by 16% in&#13;
African countries. Within the developing countries there have generally been&#13;
the kinds of changes in food sources that would be expected with improved&#13;
living standards, but just as the total increase in food consumption has been&#13;
small over this period, most of the changes observed have been small. Fbr&#13;
example, we would expect per capita consumption of roots and tubers and pulses&#13;
to decline and consumption of fruit, vegetables, meat, eggs, fish and seafoods&#13;
and milk to increase. These changes have indeed taken place, and in percentage&#13;
terms some of the changes are large, but in absolute terms the only signifi-&#13;
cant change has been the decline in pulses (20%).&#13;
11.      At the world level (see the last two columns in Table 1) the percen-&#13;
tages of total calorie consumption supplied by these various categories of&#13;
foodstuffs have also changed little. Cereals still account for 51% of the&#13;
total, with wheat and rice becoming more important and maize and millet and&#13;
sorghum relatively less important. The decline in per capita consumption of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
roots and tubers in both developed and developing countries is the most&#13;
significant change. The improvement in meat consumption is absolutely and&#13;
proportionately mostly a result of the increase in developed countries. The&#13;
declining importance of milk products and animal fats and their substitution&#13;
by vegetable fats and oils, shows up here, even in developing countries.&#13;
12.      If we take the present consumption levels of the developed countries&#13;
as the norm towards which developing countries are moving we can see that the&#13;
major changes that wi:Ll take place in the pattern of food consumption, and&#13;
which will be reflected in production and trade patterns, will be in terms of&#13;
considerable decreases in the importance of cereals and roots and tubers, and&#13;
considerable increases in the importance of sugars and honey, meat, milk, and&#13;
vegetable oils and fats. Of course, when allowance is made fcor both livestock&#13;
feed as well as direct human consumption, the net impact on cereals consump-&#13;
tion in total may well be an increase in importance in absolute and per capita&#13;
terms.&#13;
13.      But such conjectures can only give a guide to the products which can&#13;
be expected to be more or less important over the very long run. More to the&#13;
point, what are the changes we are likely to see in the next 20 years in terms&#13;
of the levels of food consumption reached in the developing countries and the&#13;
changes in importance of the various categories of foodstuffs? Further, what&#13;
will the expected deveLopments in food consumption mean for the future pattern&#13;
of production and prices of foodstuffs?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

World Bank Fbrecasts of Fbod Consumption by 1995&#13;
14.      Within the Commodities Division of the World Bank we have recently&#13;
carried out an exercise which in part led to forecasts to the year 1995 of&#13;
world (and regional) production, consumption, trade and prices of many primary&#13;
commodities of importance to developing countries. The commodities included do&#13;
not cover the entire food basket of developing countries, but represent about&#13;
70% of the total.&#13;
15.      Fbr the most part these long-term projections were derived using&#13;
comparative-static equilibrium models, disaggregated by region, where prices&#13;
are used to achieve a unique equilibrium solution. Since the models are long-&#13;
run, stock level changes are ignored. The models are demand-determined and the&#13;
consumption projections were made first by applying income elasticities of&#13;
demand by region to projected per capita GDP and population. Given a set of&#13;
regional price elasticities of supply and demand and productivity growth&#13;
rates, prices were adjusted such that through successive iterations global&#13;
production and consumption converged to equilibrium. The models assume an&#13;
absence of shocks on both the consumption and production sides. Information&#13;
concerning production developments in key countries and likely changes in&#13;
factors affecting the market such as international'commodity agreements were,&#13;
incorporated at the appropriate level. Income and price elasticities are&#13;
assumed to change over time with the evolution of a region's income level.&#13;
16.      The basic position that we take on projections of food consumption is&#13;
that the amount and composition of food is, in the aggregate and in the long&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
run, determined by aggregate demand. In this we differ from those who take a&#13;
physical capacity-cum-productivity possibility approach. That is, we believe&#13;
that the resources allocated to food production, including resources allocated&#13;
to productivity-enhancing research, are endogenous. We acknowledge that in&#13;
some countries the food-producing sector is so large a proportion of total&#13;
national product that it cannot be regarded as not being simultaneously deter-&#13;
mined with aggregate demand. Further, there are also distortions of prices&#13;
which disturb food production from the levels that would otherwise be deter-&#13;
mined by aggregate demand. However, while these influences are important,&#13;
often extremely important for individual countries, for this exercise we chose&#13;
to assume that they are captured in the projections of income growth.&#13;
17.      In looking at the level and composition of food consumption,         our&#13;
focus on aggregate demand implies that both at the world level and at the&#13;
country level access to food is not determined by physical cconstraints on food&#13;
production either within individual countries (because a country can import&#13;
whatever food it can pay for) or at a world level (because production will&#13;
respond to price incentives). Thus, it follows that we do nol: see the solution&#13;
of any "food problem" at the world level or within a particular country as a&#13;
question of overcoming food production problems on a world basis or within a&#13;
country, but as a problem of obtaining the maximum economic growth--within the&#13;
economic constraints. However, distortions of relative prices within a country&#13;
which tax food production and consumption may well reduce national income&#13;
growth and make the itask of improving food consumption levels more difficult&#13;
than it otherwise would be.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
18.      The long-term forecasts shown in Table 2 are conditional in nature.&#13;
On the demand side they rest critically on the assumptions made about the&#13;
world economy in the 1980s and 1990s. The forecasts, moreover, are positive&#13;
rather than normative. They are based on the most likely assumptions concern-&#13;
ing government policies affecting production and trade, the likely market&#13;
structures and demand conditions. Given the use of the resulting price fore-&#13;
casts in project and balance of payments analyses by the World Bank Group,&#13;
trying to determine what is most likely to happen, as opposed to what would&#13;
happen if desirable changes in policies and market structure were to take&#13;
place, becomes inescapable and appropriate.&#13;
19.      The assumptions adopted about growth in the world economy and in the&#13;
industrial, centrally planned and developing economies, represent the mid-&#13;
point of the High and Low scenarios described in the World Bank's World&#13;
Development Report, 1982. The population projections are also those of World&#13;
Development Report, 1982. These projections of income and population are shown&#13;
in Table 3.&#13;

20.      Looking at the growth rates in world consumption for the period 1961-&#13;
80 (Table 2) we can see that the importance of industrial countries in world&#13;
consumption of these foodstuffs *has declined in the past 20 years. Growth in&#13;
consumption of these commodities has been faster in the centrally planned eco-&#13;
nomies and the developing countries, reflecting their lower levels of income,&#13;
and their faster income and population growth. However, as we have seen&#13;
earlier, on a per capita basis food consumption has grown much faster in&#13;
industrial countries than in developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
21.      Overall, the growth in total consumption of these commodities is&#13;
expected to be lower in the period 1980-95 than in the period 1961-80 except&#13;
for rice and coconuts (see growth rates in last two columns). 1/ The decline&#13;
in the expected rate of growth of wheat consumption is largely a function of&#13;
the expected much slower growth in the centrally planned economies; and the&#13;
expected slowdown in growth of coarse grains consumption is a result of the&#13;
expected  slowing of growth    in industrial countries and centrally planned&#13;
economies and the consequent adverse effect on the demand for meats and feed-&#13;
stuffs. The developing countries are expected to maintain their historical&#13;
growth in grains consumiption. This, together with the expected slower growth&#13;
in population in developing countries should mean a slightly faster growth in&#13;
per capita grains consumption in developing countries than in the past 20&#13;
years. Bringing together the consumption growth rates of Table 2 and the&#13;
population growth ratesi of Table 3, it can be seen that the per capita con-&#13;
sumption of wheat, rice and coarse grains by the developing countries was&#13;
2.5%, 0.8% and 0.6% per annum, respectively, over the 1961-80 period. The&#13;
projected per capita consumption growth rates for these grains in the period&#13;
1980-95 are 2.3%, 0.9% and 1.3% respectively. The much higher rate of growth&#13;
of coarse grains is a reflection of the expected increase in the consumption&#13;
of animal products.&#13;
22.      In its major study of future food availability scenarios for develop-&#13;
ing countries the FAO imade the following projections. If, in the period 1980&#13;
to 2000, the GDP of developing countries grows at much the same rate as in the&#13;
1/ A large part of this increase in coconut product consumption will be for&#13;
non-edible uses, particularly soaps and detergents.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
past 20 years per capita food demand is projected to average 0.44% p.a.&#13;
growth. This is a faster rate of growth in per capita consumption of develop-&#13;
ing countries than the 0.3% p.a. rate achieved in the 1963-77 period (see&#13;
Table 1). Under an assumption of much higher GDP growth, coincident with&#13;
greater investment in agriculture and relaxation of trade distortions within&#13;
developing   countries   and  between   developing   countries   and  industrial&#13;
countries, it was projected by FAQ that per capita food demand could grow by&#13;
0.75% p.a. The projections of the first FAO scenario appear compatible with&#13;
our expectations of a slightly faster growth in per capita grains consumption&#13;
in the next 15-20 years.&#13;
Price Developments&#13;
23.      The cereals price forecasts to which this exercise led show a contin-&#13;
uation of the long-term declining trend in real terms (see Figures 3, 4 and 5&#13;
for long-term price series for wheat, rice and maize). 1/ Even though incomes&#13;
are increasing, and the growth of incomes in the developing countries is&#13;
having a larger impact in terms of total food demand, food demand remains&#13;
essentially price and income inelastic. Supply will respond to any increase in&#13;
demand with improvements in technology. The result will be a fall in prices.&#13;
The events of the past decade seem to bear this out. With an expansion of&#13;
demand for cereals for human consumption and for feed grains--from the fast-&#13;
growing developing countries and the centrally planned economies--supply has&#13;
I/ The maize price has shown a different pattern than wheat and rice prices&#13;
with a period of higher prices in the post-World War II period than in the&#13;
period prior. As maize is the premium feed grain, this is consistent with&#13;
the fact that beef prices were significantly higher also during the post-&#13;
World War II period.&#13;

responded. Much of this supply response has been in the grain growing areas of&#13;
North America and Oceania, which have a comparative advantage in production of&#13;
grains.&#13;
24.       Our analysis indicates that the increase in the per capita growth&#13;
rate for rice consumption (the staple food of the major proportion of low-&#13;
income people) through the projection period will be accompanied by a substan-&#13;
tial reduction in price and in trade in rice. Among the developing countries,&#13;
Indonesia (historically the largest importing country) has displayed the most&#13;
remarkable growth in consumption and production, with both increasing at 5%&#13;
p.a. over the past 20 years. This has resulted in an increase in self-suffi-&#13;
ciency and the likelihood of smaller imports in most years, as in 1981. Other&#13;
developing country importers (such as Republic of Korea, India and Bangladesh)&#13;
have also become less reliant on trade, one of the consequences of the Green&#13;
Revolution. Together with a continuation of the expansion of rice production&#13;
in the United States (since 1975 when acreage controls were relaxed) and&#13;
production subsidies in Japan, it is anticipated that world prices on the&#13;
relatively small international market will face continuing downward pressure.&#13;
Production and Yields&#13;
25.      Grains occupy by far the largest part of land under agricultural pro-&#13;
duction. Continuing increases in area harvested similar to those experienced&#13;
in the past are unlikely. 1/ Reliance on yield increases will probably rise.&#13;
1/ However, the FAO, ibid. estimated that there was still considerable&#13;
potential for area expansion in developing countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
The potential for such increments exists and past experience, particularly in&#13;
developing countries is encouraging.&#13;
26.      Over the 1980-95 period world production growth for the major food-&#13;
crops is projected as follows: rice 2.8% p.a. wheat 3.1% p.a. and coarse&#13;
grains 2.3% p.a. If yields of wheat and coarse grains were to continue to grow&#13;
at recent rates these production increases would be achieved with little&#13;
increase in area harvested. Attainment of the rice production projections,&#13;
however, will necessitate just as much reliance as in the past on increases in&#13;
area harvested, or more likely, a faster rate of growth in rice yields than in&#13;
past years. Such a possLbility exists as the major rice growing countries are&#13;
envisaged to increase the use of fertilizer, continue to develop water control&#13;
systems, as well as adopt other improved production practices. Unlike indus-&#13;
trial countries, where wheat, coarse grains and rice yields are already grow-&#13;
ing at best at a constant rate, and in some cases at a declining rate, yields&#13;
in developing countries are generally growing at an increasing rate. In other&#13;
words, in both rice and wheat, developing countries appear to be on the way to&#13;
catching up to the industrial countries in yields. Fbr coarse grains the pic-&#13;
ture seems similar but perhaps not so strong. The exception to this encourag-&#13;
ing performance by the developing countries has been in Africa, where produc-&#13;
tion of grains has lagged as improvements in yields have been much slower than&#13;
in other developing areas. This has been particularly evident in rice and&#13;
coarse grains (see Table 4 below). In Table 4 we also provide our developing&#13;
countries projections on a regional basis; these indicate that African coun-&#13;
tries will fall even further behind other developing countries in the years&#13;
ahead. Domestic price distortions which reduce incentives for agricultural&#13;
production may well be a leading factor in reducing the incentives to adopt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
new technology in these countries. Under these circumstances the pay-off to&#13;
agricultural research and to other public investments such as roads and dams&#13;
will not be as profitable as they otherwise would be.&#13;

27.      Considerable expansion of wheat, coarse grains, and even rice produc-&#13;
tion is possible in the industrial countries, if warranted by global demand.'&#13;
Currently, agricultural policies in the United States and Canada, two of the&#13;
largest wheat exporters, restrict wheat output in order to maintain farm&#13;
prices and incomes. If world prices rise, as they did in 1972-74, acreage&#13;
currently held out of production can be readily brought back into use; though&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
this response cannot be as great in terms of area as it was in the 1970s when&#13;
there was a 20% increase in the area under wheat and coarse grains--land that&#13;
farmers had been paid to hold out of production. Further, the livestock herds&#13;
of these two countries may be regarded as an enormous bufferstock of grains.&#13;
As grain prices rise livestock on feed falls thus releasing for export and&#13;
human consumption quantities of grain formerly destined to be consumed by&#13;
livestock. This indeed occurred during the 1972-73 crop shortfalls. Supply&#13;
elasticities for wheat and coarse grains in the United States, Canada, the&#13;
European Community and Australia indicate that the production response to&#13;
increased price is quit:e elastic. Export supply elasticities are considerably&#13;
larger than supply elasticities.&#13;
28.      The grains projections have been based largely on a continuation of&#13;
1961-80 rates of growth of yields. Since many developing counitries are mount-&#13;
ing successful efforts to increase yields, it is believed that the yields&#13;
assumptions used are conservative. Shown in Table 5 below are the historical&#13;
rates of growth of production, area harvested and yield for the cereals, dif-&#13;
ferentiated by main eccnomic regions. Table 6 gives average 1970-80 yields for&#13;
the grains by major regions. As the growth rates of area harvested and yield&#13;
sum to the growth rate of production, the relative contribut:Lon of yield and&#13;
area harvested to the changes in production that have occuretd can be easily&#13;
inferred. World wheat yields have been growing at the rate of 2.5% p.a.,&#13;
implying that 80% of output growth during the 1961-80 period has been due to&#13;
yield improvements. Wheiat yields have been increasing most rapidly in develop-&#13;
ing countries, especially China (5.5% p.a.), yet yields in developing&#13;
countries are still 402 below those of industrial countries.&#13;

29.      World yields of coarse grains have been growing at 2.3% p.a., imply-&#13;
ing that almost 90% of output growth has been due to yield increases. Coarse&#13;
grains yields have been growing most rapidly in industrial countries as a&#13;
rule, although again China has achieved very good yield increases in sorghum&#13;
(5% p.a. for 1961-80). Two-thirds of the growth in the world production of&#13;
rice in the past 20 years has been due to increases in yields.. Over the last&#13;
few years, rice yields in the United States have averaged 5,000 kilograms per&#13;
hectare and in Japan 6,000 kilograms per hectare. The average for developing&#13;
countries has been about: 2,000 kilograms per hectare. Clearly there exists a&#13;
great potential for "catching up."&#13;

growth in yields. The conclusions that can be drawn from these figures are&#13;
that yields are increasing at a constant or diminishing rate in industrial&#13;
countries while they are increasing at an increasing rate in developing&#13;
countries. This is a very favorable indication of the future productive poten-&#13;
tial of developing countTies; especially when the differences between yields&#13;
in industrial countriese and    developing countries   are considered.   Even if&#13;
developing countries never achieve yields of the same magnitude as industrial&#13;
countries, merely approaching current yields in industrial countries would&#13;
represent a substantial improvement and would have a significant effect on&#13;
production. Since achieving yields similar to those now common in industrial&#13;
countries involves adopting well-developed technologies, the l:echnical chal-&#13;
lenge is not difficult. The main difficulty is an organizational one that&#13;
involves providing correct incentives and removing obstacles to production&#13;
increases.&#13;

31.      World wheat yields grew at an annual rate of 3.1% from 1961 to 1970,&#13;
and at the much slower rate of 1.7% over the 1970-79 period. The slow growth&#13;
in the 1970s was entirely due to almost negligible growth in Canada, the&#13;
United States and the IJSSR. It is evident from Figure 6 that: the 1970s saw&#13;
some disturbing fluctuations in yields in the United States due to weather.&#13;
There were sharp reductions in 1974 due to the cold, wet spring and early fall&#13;
freeze, and in 1976-77 due to the extended drought. All three industrial&#13;
countries shown in Figure 6 exhibit a slowing down in the historical growth of&#13;
wheat yields. The sudden increase in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s&#13;
probably represents the partial changeover from bread wheat to higher-yielding&#13;
feed wheat. In many developing countries, as exemplified by the three examples&#13;
in Figure 6, wheat yields are growing at an increasing rate. It is hard to see&#13;
why there might be a sudden change from these recent trends.&#13;
32.      In examining( coarse grains' yields,    it is important to split the&#13;
total into maize and Dther coarse grains (where "other" include sorghum,&#13;
millet, rye, oats and barley). There are large differences in production and&#13;
yields between the othe:r coarse grains and maize, which has received the bulk&#13;
of research and develolment expenditures and which is more often irrigated&#13;
than the other coarse grains. As a result, there has already been a substan-&#13;
tial shift from sorghum and millet to the higher yielding maize. Maize&#13;
production is now more l:han half of total coarse grains production.&#13;
33.      The industrial countries have maize yields two to three times greater&#13;
than those of the rest of the world, mainly as a result of greater irrigation&#13;
and fertilizer inputs. 'he United States has, by far, the highest yields, pro-&#13;
ducing over 6.5 tons of maize per hectare. This is twice the yields achieved&#13;
in Argentina and four times the yields achieved in Brazil. Yields in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
centrally planned economies are only about half those of the United States.&#13;
Yields in the United States, producer of about half the world's total, grew&#13;
strongly in the 1961-80 period. Argentina, one of the more important develop-&#13;
ing country producers, recorded growth rates in maize yields during the 1970s&#13;
of 4.4% p.a. However, growth in maize yields in the industrial countries has&#13;
been slowing down while in the developing countries growth rates are still&#13;
increasing (Figure 7).&#13;
34.      Yields of other coarse grains are generally less than one-half of the&#13;
yields of maize. Yields in the United States, the second largest producer, are&#13;
around 2.5 tons per hectare. The USSR, the largest producer, has yields less&#13;
than half those of the United States. France and Canada are other major indus-&#13;
trial coarse grain producing countries. India, Argentina and Mexico are impor-&#13;
tant developing country producers. Data on the other coarse grains generally&#13;
show constant growth in industrial countries yields, a sharp slowdown in&#13;
growth in centrally planned economies yield growth during the 1970s by com-&#13;
parison with the 1960s, and yields in the developing countries growing faster&#13;
in the latter period (see, for example, India's sorghum yields in Figure 4).&#13;
35.      In the United States and Japan, the only major industrial country&#13;
rice producers, yields grew at an increasing rate throughout the 1950s and&#13;
early 1960s, slowing down in the late 1960s, and growing at a constant rate'&#13;
during the 1970s (Figure 8). Recent yields (1978-80 average) of rice in the&#13;
United States and Japan have been 5 and 5.8 tons per hectare, respectively,&#13;
and in industrial countries yield increases have accounted for all of the&#13;
production increases as area harvested has actually declined. The contrasting&#13;
experience of developing countries is striking. In China and the Philippines,&#13;
for example, and to a lesser extent in Thailand and Pakistan, growth rates of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35 -&#13;
yields are still increasing (Figure 8). In China, growth in yields has&#13;
increased at a fairly sl:eady rate over the last 30 years to 4.2' tons/ha in the&#13;
period 1978-80. In the l'hilippines the rate of growth in yields; since 1957 has&#13;
been much greater than in China, but is still only 2.1 tons/ha. Yields over&#13;
the period 1978-80 averaged 2.4 tons/ha in Pakistan and 2.0 tons/ha in&#13;
Thailand. In Pakistan, growth in yields, after being stagnant during the 1950s&#13;
and early 1960s, accelerated greatly during the late 1960s and early 1970s and&#13;
has since flattened off; though yields are still increasing. Thailand displays&#13;
a similiar pattern to Pakistan, though the changes have been more moderate&#13;
than in Pakistan. Over the most recent decade, increasing yields in China and&#13;
the Philippines have contributed to approximately 80% of the output increase,&#13;
while in Pakistan and Thailand increasing yields have only conl:ributed 57% and&#13;
39%, respectively, of the increased output. Considerable area expansion has&#13;
taken place in the latter two countries.&#13;
Other Factors&#13;
36.      The projections of food consumption to 1995 leave oul: some important&#13;
components of the food basket, such as eggs, milk, vegetables and other meats.&#13;
Besides changes in income, population and the income elasticii:y of demand for&#13;
food, other factors aff'ecting food consumption may also change over time. Two&#13;
factors that could be important are the distribution of income and the age&#13;
distribution of the population. Allowance was made in the above projections&#13;
for changes in income elasticity of demand over time. However, these were the&#13;
result of educated guesses. No allowance was made for change in income distri-&#13;
bution and population distribution. 'We need to get a better idea of how income&#13;
elasticities change with changes in income for different comaodities and for&#13;
this we need extensive time-series and cross-section studies. The age distri-&#13;
bution of the population should also affect food consumption patterns,&#13;
especially for commodities such as milk and meat. With developing countries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
expected to experience some significant changes in population distribution as&#13;
their population growth slows in the years ahead, there is also room for work&#13;
on this aspect of demand.&#13;
37.      As   we  noted  earlier  it   is  likely  that  within  many   developing&#13;
countries growth in food consumption has been affected, negatively, by&#13;
distorted prices and income distribution which is biased against the poor.&#13;
From data assembled by the World Bank, nominal protection coefficients (NPCs)&#13;
have been calculated for agricultural production in various countries. 1/ In&#13;
Table 7 we have presented NPCs for 19 developing countries, calculated in most&#13;
cases for the most important grain grown in each country. 2/ Bearing in mind&#13;
the qualifications attached to these estimates, it is obvious that food&#13;
production faces severe implicit or explicit taxes in many developing&#13;
countries. It is our opinion that this factor has been the most important&#13;
disincentive to the adoption of improved agricultural production performance&#13;
in Africa, the region of most persistent concern about human nutrition, and&#13;
that there would be a marked improvement if these disincentives were removed.&#13;
And to reiterate, the pay-off to public investment in research and infras-&#13;
tructure designed to assist agriculture will not be as effective as it could&#13;
be, so long as such distortions remain.&#13;
1/ The nominal protection coefficient measures the incentives or disincen-&#13;
tives faced by producers by comparison with prices they would receive if&#13;
there were free trade. The NPCs take account of tariffs, quotas and non-&#13;
tariff barriers which protect farmers as well as export taxes or other&#13;
restrictions that may penalize them. These NPC estimates are also adjusted&#13;
for exchange rate under- or over-valuation, but they are not adjusted for&#13;
the protection given to tradable inputs such as fertilizer or machinery.&#13;
Fbr an evaluation of the effects of such price distortions for several&#13;
industrial and developing countries, in terms of income transfers and&#13;
welfare reductions, see Bale and Lutz.&#13;

38.      World Bank and other estimates of Gini coefficients and other mea-&#13;
sures of income distriLbution suggest that incomes are generally much more&#13;
unevenly distributed in developing countries than in industrial countries. A&#13;
redistribution of incomes in these countries would certainly improve access to&#13;
food supplies by the poor in those countries. However, we would not argue&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
therefore for massive redistribution programs. Our opinion is that improved&#13;
pricing policies would, by encouraging agricultural production, raise the&#13;
levels of incomes of farmers and landless rural people who rely on farming for&#13;
their income. This would improve income distribution in favor of the sector in&#13;
which most of the poor are found, more effectively than any direct&#13;
intervention to change the distribution of incomes.&#13;
39.      Two final points.   The creation and development of a "world food&#13;
system" that has occurred since World War II has greatly alleviated the&#13;
possibility of widespread food shortages. At this time, virtually the entire&#13;
population of the world has access to the world food markets. Vastly improved&#13;
communications, lower surface and air transportation costs, the availability&#13;
of shipping, the construction of storage facilities, and the development of&#13;
infrastructure at dockside and in the hinterlands have all contributed to the&#13;
creation of this complex. Food merchants receive worldwide market reports on a&#13;
daily and sometimes hourly basis such that arbitrage opportunities largely&#13;
equalize the price of food commodities across the world (net of transportation&#13;
costs, government intervention activities, quality differences, and the like).&#13;
Because of these developments it is now possible to eliminate food shortages&#13;
caused by natural events. 1/&#13;
40.      And finally, it is well-known that projections of economic behavior&#13;
are notoriously unreliable (or are notoriously misinterpreted). All we know&#13;
about the future is what we hav,e observed in the past. We know that the future&#13;
will be similar to the past because in the past the future has been similar to&#13;
1/ D. Gale Johnson observed this development to one of the authors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
the past. Given this dictum we interpret the information provide!d here of over&#13;
30 years of declining agricultural prices and over 30 years of increasing crop&#13;
yields (now increasing al: an increasing rate in developing countries) as prima&#13;
facie evidence of the robustness of the world food system and of the likely&#13;
continuation of such trends. We feel that it is incumbent on those who view&#13;
the global food situation in a pessimistic way to provide a strong case of why&#13;
trends that have been in existence for at least thirty-five years will be&#13;
suddenly reversed. While we are cautiously optimistic about the continued&#13;
improvement of food consumption and food output throught the world, there is&#13;
no room for complacency. As Johnson has observed, "if circumstances are to&#13;
improve it is because efforts are made to make the improvement occur and at&#13;
least some of the hinderences that exist, such as trade restrict:ions, low farm&#13;
prices due to government constraints, and inadequate provision of farm inputs,&#13;
are ameliorated.&#13;

            Prospects for food production and
            consumption in developing countries
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The available evidence indicates that,
            in aggregate, the growth in world food production over the
            past two decades has more than kept pace with the growth in
            population. This paper analyzes recent trends in world food
            production and consumption and outlines the Bank's
            approach to projections of food production and consumption
            providing results to the year 1995. It is shown that levels
            of consumption of various food items have improved in
            developing countries and are expected to continue to
            improve. Moreover, the results indicate favorable prospects
            for food production in developing countries. The paper
            comments throughout on areas where further work is required
            to refine the projection method and qualifies the generally
            optimistic outlook by identifying the types of actions that
            will be needed to accelerate food consumption and production
            in developing countries. Pricing policies in agriculture are
            seen as being particularly critical to the optimal
            development of the agricultural system in developing countries.
