            Designing toll road concessions - lessons
            from Argentina
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Argentina began to concession its
            intercity highways and the access roads to Buenos Aires in
            the early 1990s. It first offered the intercity highways for
            competitive bids, setting the terms, the tolls, and the
            service levels and basing bid selection primarily on the
            rental offered for the infrastructure. When it concessioned
            the access roads in a second round, it set the terms and the
            investments and selected the bid offering the lowest tolls.
            The results so far have been mixed. Investment has lagged,
            but maintenance of the intercity highways has improved. The
            authors review the lessons from this experience and identify
            some of the challenges for future concessions: following
            clear and simple rules in the bidding process, establishing
            clear rules for renegotiation, and strengthening regulatory capacity.
