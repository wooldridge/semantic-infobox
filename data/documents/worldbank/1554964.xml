PRIVATE BANK LENDING TO DEVELOPING COUNTRIES:&#13;
PAST, PRESENT, AND FUTURE&#13;
A Background Study for World Development Report 1981&#13;
This paper examines the influences on private bank flows to developing&#13;
countries,  with two questions in mind:       Why do banks lend to developing&#13;
countries?   What would influence their future lending?      The paper is in five&#13;
parts.   Section I examines recent events in lending to developing countries,&#13;
with statistical coverage of the flows.        Section II examines some of the&#13;
complex relationships involved.     (The paper as a whole seeks to stress the&#13;
multiple nature of the private bank/developing country relationship.) Section&#13;
III examines the driving force behind private bank lending to developing&#13;
countries, that of profitability. Section IV examines the various constraints&#13;
on private bank lending, including questions of capital adequacy, risk&#13;
perception, and official regulation of private bank activities.         Section V&#13;
takes a brief look at the future, commenting upon the role of new private&#13;
banks (e.g., Arab banks), and provides indicative flows of funds for&#13;
developing countries to 1985.&#13;
Private bank lending to developing countries is now the subject of a&#13;
large literature, and in the past ten years much new information has been&#13;
provided.   This paper does not analyze all subjects in depth, and areas such&#13;
as the major changes in the domestic U.S. banking industry warrant greater&#13;
analysis.   The paper does provide some new data on Arab bank lending and the&#13;
exposures of national banking groups. Concentrating upon analysis of private&#13;
bank actions themselves, the paper does not set out to analyze the important&#13;
effects on developing countries of their greater reliance on private bank&#13;
financing than on aid and official financing.      The paper concludes that the&#13;
private banking community will continue to provide large amounts of finance to&#13;
developing countries.    Where problems arise, these will best be solved on a&#13;
case-by-case basis by the lending banks and the borrowing countries.&#13;

I. Banks and the Developing Countries: The Facts, 1970-81&#13;
This section in its four parts describes the principal flows of&#13;
funds between the world's private banks and the developing countries through&#13;
the 1970s to the present. 1/&#13;
Developing Countries' Debts to Banks: Stocks and Flows, 1973-81&#13;
At the end of March 1981, the developing countries [Organization of&#13;
Petroleum-Exporting Countries (OPEC) and non-OPEC countries] 2/ accounted for&#13;
US$264 billion in international claims or assets of banks. 3/          Of these&#13;
claims, $66 billion were accounted for by OPEC and $198 billion by non-OPEC&#13;
developing  countries  (see Table 1).      Alongside  these claims,   developing&#13;
countries accounted for $252 billion of bank liabilities or deposits -- $162&#13;
billion from OPEC, $90 billion from non-OPEC developing countries.     On a net&#13;
basis, therefore, OPEC stands as a $95 billion net depositor in the&#13;
Euromarket, with non-OPEC developing countries as net borrowers of $107&#13;
billion.&#13;
The countries which account for the bulk of these bank positions are&#13;
listed in Table 2, and the data reflect the heavy concentration of outstanding&#13;
bank claims with a few major borrowers (e.g., 65 percent of gross claims on&#13;
nine countries, Brazil and Mexico notable among them). On the liability side,&#13;
thirteen countries (primarily nine OPEC, Saudi Arabia and Iraq notable among&#13;
them) account for 54 percent of bank developing country liabilities.&#13;
Table 2 also provides evidence (if evidence is needed) of the&#13;
significant  differences  between net   and  gross   positions.    For  example,&#13;
Venezuela figures highly on both gross debt and deposit sides but ranks lower&#13;
in net terms (particularly for net debt).      Seven borrowers, who would rank&#13;
highly as gross depositors, account for some $35 billion in deposits (more&#13;
than Saudi Arabia's deposits) but in net terms are almost $100 billion&#13;
debtors.   And those 90 countries accounting     for less than 10 percent of&#13;
developing country gross debt are net depositors of $66 billion.         On the&#13;
deposit side, a similar group of 96 countries account for over one-quarter of&#13;
gross deposits, all of which is in aggregate offset by debts.&#13;
1/     There is now considerable data available on these flows.        Principal&#13;
sources are listed in the bibliography.&#13;
2/     This study uses three principal categories:    OPEC, non-OPEC developing&#13;
countries,  and all developing countries combined.       The hazards in&#13;
analyzing flows in aggregate are noted in the text and important&#13;
country-by-country differences distinguished.&#13;

The claims positions are dominated by banks loans to developing&#13;
countries (whether syndicated credits, trade credits, or other flows such as&#13;
bank credit lines). A further $65 billion in unused commitments can be added&#13;
to the total developing country claims figure of $280 billion as representing&#13;
unused credit facilities and probably a small undisbursed portion of existing&#13;
medium-term  loans.  4/    The  liabilities  position  is  largely  deposits  by&#13;
developing countries with banks and heavily reflects the investment of&#13;
developing countries foreign currency reserves in the Euromarket.&#13;
4/     Analysts of developing country debt and liquidity positions might wish&#13;
to treat unused credit facilities as a source of finance (to add to&#13;
reserves) rather than as obligations adding to the debt burden.&#13;

The developing country, debts account for 20 percent of banks'&#13;
international  assets;  the  ratio  has  been  relatively   steady.   Developing&#13;
country deposits account for 19 percent of deposits in the Euromarket. These&#13;
ratios, however, include all interbank positions in the "gross Euromarket"&#13;
definition ($1334 billion), whereas the ne,t Euromarket (i.e., net of interbank&#13;
positions)  is estimated at only $810 billion.       An alternative comparative&#13;
measure of the developing country debt and deposit positions can be derived&#13;
from the BIS "Sources and Uses" calculations (Table 3), which has the&#13;
advantage of netting out interbank positions. 5/&#13;

5/     This  measure   does  have  the  disadvantage   of  covering  only   banks&#13;
reporting in Europe (the narrow Euromarket definition), but it will&#13;
include positions of U.S. banks' offices in Europe.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
On this measure developing countries account for 18 percent of&#13;
Euromarket debts but a rather higher ratio of deposits (27 percent).         The&#13;
ratios are particularly different for OPEC's deposit contribution under the&#13;
second measurement (perhaps reflecting OPEC preference to deposit in European&#13;
centers).&#13;
Syndicated Bank Credits to Developing Countries, 1970-81&#13;
A significant portion of developing country debts have been&#13;
established via the syndicated bank Eurocurrency credit, on a floating&#13;
interest rate basis.   In 1971-80 non-oil developing countries raised (gross)&#13;
some $131 billion (see Table 4) or just over one-third of all syndicated&#13;
credits, while OPEC raised over $50 billion.     The bulk of these credits have&#13;
been raised since 1975 ($110 billion of non-oil developing country credits,&#13;
$45  billion  for OPEC).     (See also  "Recent Lending Volumes,"    below,  for&#13;
trends.)&#13;
This source of credit is considerably larger than the fixed-rate&#13;
bond markets to which developing countries have had only limited access (see&#13;
Table 5).   The "lender" in the case of a bond is a different entity from the&#13;
lender in a bank credit.      A bond has to trade in the public market, and&#13;
investors need to be well assured that the credit standing of the issuer&#13;
(borrower) is high, otherwise the paper becomes less acceptable and thus less&#13;
attractive to the investor. And the investor does not normally build the same&#13;
direct relationship with the issuer as can a bank with its clients.&#13;
Developing countries, where they have wished to issue tradeable&#13;
paper, have issued a number of floating-rate notes (FRNs) since this market's&#13;
rapid growth from the mid-1970s.     The FRN (most often issued by a bank) is&#13;
often regarded as a "halfway house" between a bond and a credit, and many are&#13;
purchased by banks rather than by institutional investors, making the ultimate&#13;
lender or source of credit very similar to that of the bank credit.     In 1980,&#13;
$4.5 billion of FRNs were issued (source:        Organization for Economic Co-&#13;
Operation and Development, OECD), of which developing countries accounted for&#13;
approxmately half of the issues.&#13;

Terms of Banks' Loans: Margins, Fees, Maturities&#13;
The terms on which developing countries obtain finance from the&#13;
private banks vary according to borrower and type of credit facilfty&#13;
arranged. This section deals exclusively with the most visible indication of&#13;
these terms; namely, terms for floating-rate syndicated bank credits.&#13;
Margins&#13;
Margins over LIBOR (London inter-bank offered rate) for syndicated&#13;
credits change according to overall market conditions and the individual&#13;
position of each borrower. 6/ Table 6 indicates the market "cycle" in margins&#13;
for  all  developing  countries  since   1975.   Margins   are  currently  at  a&#13;
historical low, but for a few countries the sheer volume of funds needed has&#13;
pushed up margins, particularly as lenders become increasingly wary of the&#13;
risk and reach internal country limits. A trend toward selective increases in&#13;
margins looks set to continue, while certain borrowers can still obtain fine&#13;
terms.&#13;
As market conditions change there typically is some shift in the&#13;
difference between margins for prime borrowers and those for high-risk&#13;
borrowers. In 1978 margins were being negotiated in a 1.5 percent range, from&#13;
0.50 percent to 2 percent over LIBOR.      By 1980 margins had fallen and the&#13;
range had narrowed, to 1.25 percent (0.25 to 1.5 percent).     Back in 1975 the&#13;
range was only 0.75 percent (1.25 to 2 percent).     (See Table 6.)   Developing&#13;
countries   have  typically   paid  higher  margins   than  industrial   country&#13;
borrowers, the average spread being roughly 0.25 percent to 0.5 percent over&#13;
the spread for industrial country borrowers.    In effect, during the period of&#13;
falling margins, terms for prime borrowers improved more rapidly than for&#13;
other borrowers.   Eventually all borrowers' terms improved.   Now, the rise in&#13;
margins for prime borrowers is likely to lag the selective increase for other&#13;
borrowers.   In the second half of 1980, margins for developing countries rose&#13;
slightly from 0.74 percent average to 0.85 percent (see Table 6) while margins&#13;
for industrial country borrowers became a little finer (0.44 percent to 0.42&#13;
percent).&#13;
6/     Historically, the cycle in margins has been inverse to the cycle in&#13;
interest rates, since it is affected in opposite ways by the business&#13;
cycle.  For example, margins typically rise during    economic downturns&#13;
(as risks and bankruptcies increase), though this may also be a period&#13;
of falling interest rates (as in the current recession). For a fuller&#13;
discussion, see Bank of England Discussion Paper no. 12 (R.B. Johnston)&#13;
and BIS Working Paper no. 1 (K. Inoue).&#13;

Fees&#13;
Banks typically earn a variety of fees on syndicated credits --&#13;
management fees, participation fees, commitment fees, etc. -- often of the&#13;
order of 0.25 percent up to, say, 2.5 percent front end, according to the&#13;
bank-s role in the credit (the fee is normally larger the higher the share of&#13;
the loan taken by the bank). In addition, fees may be earned from third-party&#13;
participants in the transaction; e.g., from contractors involved in a&#13;
project.   In recent years fees have fallen as terms have increasingly favored&#13;
the borrower.&#13;
Fees can significantly "sweeten" the transaction for the lender&#13;
without pushing up the interest margin (borrowers will be keen to prevent the&#13;
margin's rising if possible, since it is a very visible sign of effective&#13;
creditworthiness in the market).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
Maturities&#13;
As well as margins and fees rising, as market conditions tighten&#13;
maturities on new credits tend to shorten.      Individual borrowers often play&#13;
one factor against another -- where the amortization schedule on existing debt&#13;
is particularly onerous, the willingness to accept higher margins rather than&#13;
shorten the maturity might be greater.    Equally prime borrowers who may feel&#13;
assured of obtaining funds at any period (and thus of having little problem&#13;
with rollovers or refinancing maturing) may be more willing to shorten&#13;
maturites rather than accept higher spreads.        Shortening the maturity on&#13;
credits is a less painful way for a country to immediately accept harder&#13;
conditions, though it may have a potentially damaging effect upon the future&#13;
repayment schedule.&#13;
Table 7 indicates the cycle in maturities with developing country&#13;
maturities averaging 5 years in 1976, but now being as high as 7 to 8 years.&#13;
Developing country credits had even been for longer periods than those for&#13;
industrial country borrowers in the first half of 1980, even though&#13;
maturities   for developing countries have, over the longer run, typically been&#13;
shorter. 7/    In the second half of 1980, developing countries       maturities&#13;
continued   to  shorten,   while   industrial  country   borrowers'   maturities&#13;
lengthened (see Table 7).&#13;
7/     It is frequently asked why bank loans to developing countries cannot be&#13;
considerably longer than 10 years to meet long-term (e.g., 15-20 years)&#13;
development requirements.    It should be noted that medium-term bank&#13;
loans are themselves already a departure from traditional bank lending&#13;
(often short-term credits rolled over for clients). And if confidence&#13;
was such that a developing *country could obtain 15-20 years finance,&#13;
then bond markets would probably be open to them, obviating the need&#13;
for long-term syndicated credits.&#13;

Slowdown in Lending, 1980&#13;
Non-OPEC developing countries borrowed considerably less from the&#13;
Eurocurrency market in 1980 than in 1979, in the form of publicized syndicated&#13;
bank credits.    Syndicated creidts for non-OPEC developing countries totaled&#13;
$26 billion in 1980 compared with $34 billion in 1979.        At the same time,&#13;
lending to OPEC countries was also down, from $8.6 to $6.4 billion.         Only&#13;
lending to industrial countries showed a rise, from $30 billion in 1979 to $42&#13;
billion in 1980 (see Table 8).&#13;

The slowdown in lending in 1980 can be attributed to four major&#13;
factors:&#13;
*   The  changed   individual  position   of  seven   major&#13;
borrowers (who account for two-thirds of all developing&#13;
country borrowing)&#13;
*   The high level of interest rates&#13;
*   The record level of prepayments and refinancings which&#13;
"balooned" the 1979 data&#13;
*   The Iran hostage crisis.&#13;
Data Influenced   by Seven Borrowers.     The marked slackening   in&#13;
syndicated bank credit lending to developing countries in 1980 was heavily&#13;
influenced by lower borrowing by seven countries:      Brazil, China, Korea,&#13;
Mexico, Algeria, Nigeria, and the Philippines.      For these countries, the&#13;
volume of loans was 43 percent less than that arranged in 1979.    Lending to&#13;
other developing countries rose by 9 percent (see Table 9).   The reasons for&#13;
the slowdown in borrowing by these countries can be traced to factors&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
pertinent to each individual country. Brazil was able to reduce its borrowing&#13;
requirement by drawing down its reserves.     This strategy was partly a matter&#13;
of choice (reduced reserves as part of the domestic monetary control program)&#13;
and partly as a result of tighter market conditions for Brazil.      (Brazil was&#13;
reluctant to pay higher spreads; the market was reluctant to increase&#13;
exposure).    The  total  financing   requirement  of $12   billion was   met by&#13;
borrowing on the syndicated market, by a reduction in reserves, and by short-&#13;
term credit.   Korea faced a less receptive market in 1980 after the death of&#13;
President Park in late 1979 and the domestic political and social unrest of&#13;
early 1980.&#13;

The Philippines borrowing has remained closely linked to the&#13;
International Monetary Fund (IMF) financing package, which restricts the total&#13;
level of borrowing and the debt-service ratio.    Algeria chose to reduce its&#13;
borrowing in the market, and Nigeria and Mexico, both benefiting from higher&#13;
oil prices, were able to be less active borrowers.    China, after substantial&#13;
borrowing in 1979, was generally less active in the market in 1980 because&#13;
spending plans were revised.&#13;
Shock of High Interest Rates.     Record high U.S. dollar interest&#13;
rates, peaking for a short while at 20 percent at the end of the first quarter&#13;
of 1980, accentuated the interest costs of certain countries debt and&#13;
probably had a short-term discouraging effect upon borrowing plans.   Possibly&#13;
the shock effect of high rates at certain times had more influence on strategy&#13;
than on actual costs.    In 1980, the six-month Eurodollar rate averaged 14&#13;
percent a year, only 2 percent above the 1979 rate (see Table 10). Going back&#13;
to 1978, of course, the average rate was lower (at 8.8 percent), and possibly&#13;
the 1980 shock or surprise was that rates stayed high, and hit new peaks, when&#13;
many expected some easing after the 1979 rise over 1978.&#13;

High Prepayments and Refinancing, 1979.    A considerable portion of&#13;
1979 credits were for the prepayment and refinancing (at lower spreads) of&#13;
existing credits (no longer a feasible strategy, at least for developig&#13;
countries).   These prepayments and refinancings thus exaggerated the 1979&#13;
total and have been estimated at some $12 billion of total loans arranged. 8/&#13;
The Iran Hostage Crisis and U.S. Freeze on Iranian Assets.      These&#13;
events dampened first-quarter activity in 1980 as the Euromarket assessed its&#13;
impact on deposit and debt positions.     OPEC depositors were faced with new&#13;
risk considerations in placing funds with banks -- the Euromarket grew by only&#13;
2.4 percent a year in the first quarter of 1980 compared with 24 percent in&#13;
1979.&#13;
The Pick-Up in Lending, 1981&#13;
In 1981 developing countries as a group (unlike other groups) have&#13;
been more active in the market than in 1980, although in the first five months&#13;
the amount of syndicated credits arranged was still below the 1979 figure on&#13;
an annualized basis (see Table 9).     Again, as in 1980, there are divergent&#13;
trends among different borrowers. Of the OPEC countries, Nigeria has borrowed&#13;
a substantial amount in 1981, back to the annual rate of 1979. Venezuela, in&#13;
contrast, has been much less active so far in 1981 compared with 1980.      For&#13;
the five major non-OPEC borrowers (Brazil, China, Mexico, Korea, Philipines),&#13;
the annualized rate of borrowing in 1981 has shown a further small fall on&#13;
1980,  whereas   other  non-OPEC  countries  have  increased   their  borrowing&#13;
substantially in 1981 (by 60 percent on an annualized basis).       India is a&#13;
notable substantial new borrower in the market, raising already $880 million&#13;
in 1981 compared with only $148 million in the whole of 1980.&#13;
II. Banks and the Developing Countries: The Complexities&#13;
Analysis of future bank lending to developing countries involves a&#13;
wide range of issues. This part of the study seeks to unravel, in three&#13;
subsections, some of the complexities of the private bank/developing country&#13;
relationship.    The first provides a checklist of bank/developing country&#13;
activities    outside   the   more    frequently   discussed    lender-borrower&#13;
relationship.   The second explores the question of how German, U.K., U.S.,&#13;
French, and other banks positions differ with respect to developing&#13;
countries.   The third examines the question of how the 1980s     revolution in&#13;
the U.S. financial services industry will likely affect flows to developing&#13;
countries.&#13;

The Multiple Relationship&#13;
There are five important bank/developing country activities that&#13;
warrant consideration:&#13;
*   Developing country deposits with banks&#13;
*   Correspondent banking in developing countries&#13;
*   Banks' representation in developing countries&#13;
*   Corporate finance.&#13;
All five factors are highly significant:     developing countries' deposits are&#13;
often as large as their borrowings (see the first subsection of Section I).&#13;
Trade and corporate finance have long been a source of bank business with&#13;
developing countries, well before the 1970s' Euromarket explosion of medium-&#13;
term lending.   Banks' offices in developing countries have provided a wider&#13;
business commitment to developing countries (domestic and international) than&#13;
can be gained purely from "arm's length" foreign currency lending via&#13;
syndicated credits.    Correspondent banking establishes a working network of&#13;
banks in and outside developing countries, with a two-way flow of financial&#13;
services and funds.    The medium-term funds to developing countries will be&#13;
bound up in the future of these multiple banking relationships.     The ways in&#13;
which these factors influence the flow of funds to developing countries and&#13;
the lender/borrower relationship are briefly summarized in the following&#13;
paragraphs.&#13;
Developing Country Deposits with Banks&#13;
Since 1973 developing countries have built up substantial deposits&#13;
with Euromarket banks, from $44 billion to $252 billion.      This rapid growth&#13;
reflects both the increase in OPEC's financial resources and the continued&#13;
placement by developing country governments of part of their reserves in bank&#13;
deposits (see Table 11).&#13;

For   banks,   developing   country  deposits   have   a   particular&#13;
importance.    First, governments' placement of reserves are a significant&#13;
source of non-bank time deposits for banks.    As Euromarket banks are already&#13;
much more heavily dependent on interbank deposits for funding than is normal&#13;
in domestic markets, it is particularly important, for prudential reasons, to&#13;
have a good non-bank source of funds (to reduce vulnerability in any period of&#13;
liquidity shortage). Second, banks income can be improved by building a good&#13;
relationship with a developing country on the deposit side (a bank may be able&#13;
to obtain a slightly lower deposit rate, or even substantial free balances,&#13;
from a regular borrower). Third, deposits from a developing country borrower,&#13;
when netted out against loans to that developing country, may provide greater&#13;
comfort for the bank with a high exposure relative to its country limit (see&#13;
also the first subsection of Section IV).&#13;
For the developing country, its deposits in the market also play a&#13;
relationship role. A developing country may enjoy higher deposit rates from a&#13;
bank seeking business from the developing country (for example, an attractive&#13;
syndicated loan mandate, branch licence, etc.).       And in income terms, it&#13;
should be noted that, although interest payments on non-oil developing country&#13;
debts amounted to almost $40 billion in 1980, interest income on reserves was&#13;
probably close to $7 billion.&#13;
Offsetting the popular picture of developing countries seeking&#13;
funds from banks and trying to negotiate a low spread or long maturity is the&#13;
picture of banks equally active in soliciting funds from developing countries&#13;
and bidding competitive deposit prices according to the two-way relationship.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
Trade Finance&#13;
There are three key variations in the bank/developing country&#13;
relationship brought in by trade financing. First, trade financing has been a&#13;
long-established function of banks' international business with developing&#13;
countries, and this has laid the basis for other flows.    Second, the turnover&#13;
of trade finance is much larger than for medium-term finance, since a large&#13;
portion of trade paper carries short maturities (for example, 90-day, 180-day&#13;
bills -- hence, 50 percent of developing country debts to banks mature within&#13;
one year, representing the high proportion of trade paper).        Third, trade&#13;
finance often carries export credit guarantees from the country exporting to&#13;
the developing country, enabling banks to provide finance to developing&#13;
countries without taking a developing country exposure. A small illustration&#13;
of the importance of such third-party guarantees is provided in Table 12. Of&#13;
U.S. banks' exposure to non-oil developing countries at the end of 1980 of $75&#13;
billion, $5 billion carried guarantees from outside the' non-oil developing&#13;
countries.    For U.K. banks, a more marked pattern emerges ($26        billion&#13;
exposure netting   down to $20 billion).     Of course, developing    countries&#13;
themselves also issue such guarantees, and thus the final bank exposure takes&#13;
this additional exposure into account (third column of Table 12).      For U.S.&#13;
banks, the final net figure is in fact larger, at $77 billion, than the&#13;
nominal exposure in the first column of Table 12.&#13;

Correspondent Banking in Developing Countries&#13;
Banks conduct a significant portion of their business through&#13;
correspondent banks -- i.e., using other banks' facilities where the bank&#13;
itself has no office.    U.S. banks, being currently restricted to one state;&#13;
must use correspondents to transfer funds nationwide.      Similarly, banks have&#13;
built up extensive networks of correspondent banks in developing countries.&#13;
For example, French banks report 70 percent of their overseas assets as being&#13;
with "correspondents"   rather than "clients." 9/      These networks not only&#13;
enable banks to carry out transactions in developing countries but also result&#13;
in a flow of credit to developing country banks.       Such lines of credit are&#13;
particularly important in providing developing country banks with foreign&#13;
exchange liquidity.    For a developing country, the more extensive its own&#13;
banks' relationship can be with international banks, 10/ the more likely it&#13;
will be that during any interruption in the flow of medium-term credit (e.g.,&#13;
during a government debt rescheduling) the country will be able to at least&#13;
keep trading.     (Where a debt crisis forces a country      to virtually cease&#13;
importing except on a cash basis, the economic impact of that debt crisis will&#13;
be particularly severe.)&#13;
Branch and Representative Operations&#13;
in Developing Countries&#13;
International banks have extensive overseas operations in the form&#13;
of local branches/affiliates/representatives or joint ventures in the&#13;
developing countries. Many go back to    the 19th century, others were built up&#13;
during colonial periods, and branches have also increased rapidly in the&#13;
1970s. One hundred and fifty-nine U.S. banks, 11/ for example, had a total of&#13;
599 branches overseas at end 1980, with branch assets totaling $320 billion.&#13;
In 1971 such branches totaled 577, with total assets of $55 billion.        More&#13;
recently, developing countries have been less willing to grant branch licences&#13;
to foreign banks, in an effort to support their own national banks, or have&#13;
only lifted their restrictions for a limited period, encouraging banks to come&#13;
in while the "window"    is open.    Others impose a maximum limit on shares&#13;
foreign banks can hold in domestic banks.&#13;
Recently Korea, Argentina, Sri Lanka, and Chile among the developing&#13;
countries  have   allowed  in  a  number   of  foreign  banks.    Others   (e.g.,&#13;
Philippines, Bahrain) now permit mainly offshore banking units to be set up or&#13;
may only allow a new foreign bank in when an existing licence is vacated.&#13;
Access may depend upon reciprocity between countries (i.e., when one country&#13;
allows another country's banks to open only if similar access is given to its&#13;
own banks in that other country).&#13;

branches, subsidiaries, and representatives.&#13;

- 19 -&#13;
Branch banking in a developing country allows a bank to build&#13;
additional portfolios in domestic currencies.    Domestic loans are thus offset&#13;
by  domestic  currency  deposits.    The   developing  country  gains  from  the&#13;
additional banking expertise (and in considering new licenses will look for&#13;
the contribution the bank will make over and above the hard currency brought&#13;
in).  The bank will, of course, wish to remit a portion of its profits out of&#13;
the country.   Branch activities also allow banks to build a more extensive&#13;
business relationship with the developing countries' private corporate sector,&#13;
whereas cross-country foreign currency lending so often is dominated by loans&#13;
to governments or banks in developing countries. At end 1980, only 35 percent&#13;
of U.S. banks exposure to developing countries was accounted for by loans&#13;
directly to the developing country private sector (excluding local currency&#13;
loans).  A significant exposure is also built up by local currency loans from&#13;
branches in the developing countries.&#13;
Corporate Client Activity&#13;
OECD banks derive a great deal of their business in developing&#13;
countries from their own corporate clients (from project financing, trade&#13;
credits, and all other banking services).     Insofar as OECD corporations are&#13;
increasing their trade and investment with developing countries, so are these&#13;
bankers naturally drawn into developing country business, with or without a&#13;
developing country credit risk attached.     In addition, banks will naturally&#13;
build up an international developing country customer base as developing&#13;
country companies trade overseas.&#13;
These five factors illustrate the multiple relationship lying behind&#13;
the stark bank asset and liabilty positions with developing countries.      They&#13;
reflect a wide commitment to banking business in the developing countries and&#13;
hold important implications for the income stream of banks.     Profitability of&#13;
lending  to developing   countries  thus has to take these five areas into&#13;
account.   For one bank, a 0.75 percent spread over LIBOR may be ludicrously&#13;
low without any other relationship; for others, 0.75 percent over LIBOR may&#13;
make sense when assessing the overall profitabiltiy of the bank's business&#13;
with that country.   With respect to the eventual flow of funds to developing&#13;
countries (the focus of this study), two concluding points are relevant:&#13;
*   The relationships can provide income to the banks and&#13;
banking services to developing countries without a&#13;
massive accumulation of debt.&#13;
*   The relationships can also provide developing countries&#13;
with a means to accumulate debt without even having to&#13;
raise a medium-term syndicated credit.&#13;
Distinctions between Banking Groups&#13;
In the previous subsection the complexities of banks' relationships&#13;
with developing countries were summarized.     This subsection illustrates the&#13;
significant differences between banking groups themselves; for example,&#13;
between the developing country asset/liability positions of U.S. banks&#13;
compared with those of German banks. Is exposure to developing countries high&#13;
for some banks compared with others?&#13;

Share of Market and Developing&#13;
Country Exposure: Data Analysis&#13;
Much aggregate data are available from BIS on the position of the&#13;
total Euromarket with developing countries, but data on each national banking&#13;
group's position with developing countries are less widely available.      The&#13;
following comments provide some insight into the contribution by each banking&#13;
group, with particular attention to banks in the United Kingdom, United&#13;
States, France, Germany, Netherlands, and Luxembourg. 12/&#13;
U.S. Banks.  As of end 1980, U.S. banks accounted for 38 percent of&#13;
all banks' gross exposure to developing countries (oil and non-oil) (U.S.&#13;
Federal Reserve and BIS data for circulation by Amex Bank). The share of U.S.&#13;
banks has been falling steadily as other banks have stepped up activities.&#13;
(These data include the positions of U.S. banks' overseas branches.)       The&#13;
trend mainly reflects the fact that U.S. banks tended to be the first into the&#13;
Euromarket, and now other banking groups are catching up.   In addition, it is&#13;
likely that as U.S. banks reach various country limits, and spreads remain&#13;
narrow, so their appetite for developing country lending is reduced.&#13;
Developing  country   exposure  as  a   percentage  of  U.S.  banks'&#13;
international activities has been relatively steady, with non-OPEC developing&#13;
countries accounting for 22 percnt of U.S. banks' overseas assets, and OPEC&#13;
countries 6.3 percent (see Table 13).&#13;

German Banks. Banks in the Federal Republic of Germany report total&#13;
claims on developing countries of $27.4 billion at end 1980 (Amex Bank&#13;
statistics),  of  which  $4.9  billion are claims    on OPEC.     The  share  of&#13;
developing countries in German banks' overseas portfolios (which total $8.7&#13;
billion) looks high at 31.5 percent, but this ratio should be treated with&#13;
some caution for two reasons.   First, these data include "soft loans" lent by&#13;
German banks with accompanying German government guarantees (i.e., in effect&#13;
certain aid flows).   Second, the non-OPEC group includes positions of German&#13;
banks with offshore centers (e.g., in the Caribbean, Hong Kong, Singapore).&#13;
These offshore positions are probably less substantial than the soft&#13;
loans position.   It is reasonable to reduce the non-OPEC claims on banks by&#13;
some $12 billion, to net out the soft loans position and the factors of&#13;
offshore centers.   This brings the total German bank overseas asset position&#13;
down to $75 billion, closer to the BIS total.      As a result, the "adjusted"&#13;
exposure of German banks to developing countries (OPEC and non-OPEC) is&#13;
probably around 6 percent of all the Euromarket and represents 21 percent of&#13;
German banks' overseas assets (rather than 31.5 percent), slightly above the&#13;
market average exposure of 20 percent and below the U.S. banks ratio of 28&#13;
percent at end 1980 (see Table 13).&#13;
U.K. banks.    The overseas assets of U.K.-owned banks and their&#13;
branches reached $106 billion at end 1980 (Table 13) or 8 percent of the&#13;
Euromarket.   Twenty-three percent of these assets were claims on developing&#13;
countries (17 percent non-OPEC), and thus U.K. banks account for 9 percent of&#13;
all banks' claims on developing countries (British-owned banks account for&#13;
only 23 percent of banks' overseas assets reported in the U.K., and these&#13;
positions of U.K.-owned banks and their branches should not be confused with&#13;
the positions of banks reporting in the U.K.).&#13;
Dutch Banks.   Total overseas assets are reported at $62 billion at&#13;
end 1980 (Table 13), of which 9 percent is accounted for by developing&#13;
countries (8 percent non-OPEC, 1 percent OPEC).      Thus, although Dutch banks&#13;
account for almost 5 percent of all Euromarket claims, they account for only 2&#13;
percent of Euromarket claims on developing countries.&#13;
French Banks.    Limited published data show 23 percent of French&#13;
banks' claims are on developing countries (Table 13), with French banks thus&#13;
accounting for 12 percent of all Euromarket claims on developing countries.&#13;
The data indicate a substantial amount of French franc credits with French-&#13;
speaking countries among this developing country exposure.&#13;
Luxembourg Banks.   As in London, positions of banks in Luxembourg&#13;
cover  a  wide  range  of  national  banks.    German   banks  are  particularly&#13;
important, covering 29 out of the 112 banks in Luxemborug (as of May 1981),&#13;
compared with only 12 Belgian/Luxembourg banks. Overall, the Luxembourg group&#13;
shows a fairly low percentage of assets (16 percent) with developing countries&#13;
(Table 13;   15 percent non-OPEC, 1 percent OPEC).    As a share of the market,&#13;
Luxembourg banks account for 5 percent of all claims on developing countries.&#13;

Share of Market and Developing Country&#13;
Exposure: Comparison&#13;
The data in Table 14 indicate the continued dominant position of&#13;
U.S. banks in the Euromarket (27 percent) and even greater dominance of&#13;
lending  to  developing  countries  (38  percent).    As pointed   out,  their&#13;
developing country share is declining, which also matches the falling share of&#13;
U.S. banks in the market as a whole. Perhaps surprisingly, the data show that&#13;
French banks are the next largest group, with respect to developing country&#13;
loans and share of market as a whole, followed by U.K. banks (note that&#13;
Japanese Banks, a major force, do not publish developing country data in this&#13;
form).&#13;

With respect to each banking group's developing country exposure as&#13;
a percentge of its foreign assets, the data suggest that U.S. banks have the&#13;
greatest exposure (28 percent of U.S. foreign assets being with developing&#13;
countries, followed by the U.K. banks and French banks, with German banks&#13;
meeting the average and Dutch banks exposure being well below the market&#13;
average -- see Table 13).&#13;

Different   reporting  arrangements   and  less   than  full   country&#13;
disclosure, in certain cases, preclude drawing firm conclusions on the&#13;
positions  of each   banking  group  from  this analysis.     Nevertheless,  the&#13;
capacity of each group to increase its developing country exposure clearly&#13;
varies considerably (when analyzing developing country assets as a percentage&#13;
of total assets).   Thus, even if U.S. banks are reaching "country limits" or&#13;
other such constraints, this may not be the case for the other two-thirds of&#13;
the Euromarket.    At the same time, with German, U.K.,      and French banks'&#13;
developing country exposure getting fairly close to the U.S. position, the&#13;
room for further increases in the European banks' market share, relieving the&#13;
"burden" on U.S. banks, may now be limited.&#13;
Changes in the U.S. Financial Services Industry&#13;
Changes now under way in the U.S. financial services industry&#13;
warrant attention in this study for three main reasons.      First, the changes&#13;
influence the evolving structure of U.S. banks at a time when structural&#13;
considerations (for example, capital adequacy; see Section IV) are themselves&#13;
major factors in determining U.S. banks' ability and desire to lend overseas&#13;
(e.g., to developing countries).    Second, the changes undoubtedly alter the&#13;
relative attractiveness of domestic vs.     international banking.    Since the&#13;
principal reason for U.S. banks' international growth has been the pursuit of&#13;
profit and expansion outside the constrained domestic market, finance growth&#13;
plans may now change markedly.       Third, because U.S.   banks remain market&#13;
leaders  in the Euromarket,    their future direction will have not only a&#13;
numerical impact on the flow of funds but also an influence on other banking&#13;
strategies.&#13;
The revolution in the U.S. fnancial system (and revolution is not&#13;
too strong a description) is occurring along four main lines:&#13;
* The advent of multistate banking in the United States&#13;
* Technological changes in banking&#13;
* The expanding role of non-bank financial institutions&#13;
* Changes in regulations, notably in reserve requirements&#13;
and the commencement of international banking facilities&#13;
(IBFs) in New York.&#13;
Advent of Multistate Banking&#13;
Banks in the United States are currently only permitted to conduct&#13;
banking activities in one state (and some states confine banks to one town or&#13;
even a single location).      This restriction is rapidly being broken down.&#13;
Indeed, some banks, through their representatives across the United States,&#13;
already have multistate facilities in all but name.       While the legislative&#13;
battle is still to be enacted, multistate banking should have arrived within&#13;
the next 3 to 5 years.&#13;
This landmark in U.S. banking history will not pass without strongly&#13;
influencing the international direction of U.S. banks.       First, it suggests&#13;
that the growth potential for the large money-center banks may switch from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
international to domestic business.     Second, via mergers of banks holding&#13;
mainly domestic assets with banks holding a mix of domestic and international&#13;
assets, the current ratios of international to domestic assets could change&#13;
swiftly (whether this increases the capacity of banks to lend overseas depends&#13;
upon subsequent management direction and profit factors).     Third, the change&#13;
may open up more profitable areas of business in the United States for U.S.&#13;
banks, so that the hitherto relative profitabilty of international lending may&#13;
decline.&#13;
Technological Changes in Banking&#13;
New technology -- notably EFT (electronic fund transfer) -- is&#13;
perhaps at the root of the revolutionary changes        in U.S.  banking.    The&#13;
breakdown of geographical restriciton on banks as detailed above undoubtedly&#13;
stems from the new technology's making physical location less and less&#13;
important.   Technological changes also have effects on banking costs (which&#13;
hitherto have tended to rise faster than capital because of inflation).      And&#13;
where the technology replaces human input, so non-banks can more easily&#13;
acquire new banking capabilities.     Technological changes per se should not&#13;
directly affect international banking strategies, but as a driving force&#13;
behind the other structural changes they play a crucial part.&#13;
Expanding Role of Non-Bank Financial Institutions&#13;
In addition to being geographically restricted, U.S. banks have also&#13;
been closely controlled with respect to the services they may offer.         For&#13;
example,  investment  and commercial   banking  are  strictly  separated.    But&#13;
gradually various non-bank financial institutions have been offering bank-like&#13;
services, resulting in a breakdown of some of the traditional barriers (e.g.,&#13;
Sears Roebuck is a major provider of consumer finance; Merrill Lynch is&#13;
competing with banks through money-market mutual funds).      A recent spate of&#13;
mergers  and  acquisitions  has  highlighted the changes:     Prudential-Bache,&#13;
American Express-Shearsons,   Phibro-Salomon Bros.     As these changes occur,&#13;
regulations are slowly adapting to the new marketplace.&#13;
Regulatory Changes&#13;
As indicated in the previous paragraphs, a number of the changes&#13;
occurring in the U.S. financial services industry will be accompanied by&#13;
regultory changes that accommodate the changes in the market.        Of course,&#13;
until the necessary legislation is passed, the changes themselves will not&#13;
have their full force. There are also other changes occurring that themselves&#13;
may generate a new importance for international banking in the United&#13;
States.   The new IBFs now permitted in New York have the potential to bring&#13;
back some of the Eurocurrency business from the world financial centers.&#13;
Because these deposits will be free of reserve requirements, they should be&#13;
fairly competitive with other Eurocurrency rates, although such deposits will&#13;
be  subject  to Federal   Deposit  Insurance.     Other  changes  are  occurring&#13;
internally: the Federal Reserve now imposes reserve requirements on all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
depository institutions to halt the exodus of banks from the Federal Reserve&#13;
system (with some success). 13/&#13;
At this stage it is difficult to assess the full effect of all these&#13;
considerations   on   growth    potential,   balance   sheet   structures,   and&#13;
profitability -- and thus on the international ambitions of U.S. banks.      The&#13;
current banking returns in certain states are very attractive (e.g., in&#13;
California and Texas). 14/ Spreads on international business are at historic&#13;
lows, and concerns over country risk are as strong as at any point.&#13;
Meanwhile, the options for U.S. banks are rapidly widening.&#13;
There is new competition for existing banks as the nature of the&#13;
financial services industry changes.   Profitability will be the key to banks'&#13;
choice between pursuing growth in the new domestic scene and building upon&#13;
their positions outside the United States.&#13;
III. The Prime Incentive of Profit&#13;
Profitability of private bank lending to developing countries should&#13;
dominate this study. Profit ultimately determines whether banks will wish to&#13;
continue  lending  to developing   countries.   The analytic problem is that&#13;
identification of profitability of developing country lending is difficult --&#13;
nonetheless, the principal available evidence can be marshalled and the effect&#13;
of profit considerations on future developing country lending identified.&#13;
Evidence on Profitability of Lending to Developing Countries&#13;
There are two data sources for assessing the profitability of&#13;
lending to developing countries:      data on spreads on loans to developing&#13;
countries and data on banks' international earnings from individual banks'&#13;
balance sheets.&#13;
Spreads&#13;
In Section I, the subsection "Terms of Banks' Loans" summarized the&#13;
trends in margins/spreads on banks to developing countries.      On the face of&#13;
it, lending to developing countries is far less profitable than it was in,&#13;
say,  1975.   When spreads   fell through 0.5    percent over LIBOR for prime&#13;
borrowers, bankers were quoted as saying there was no longer any profit in the&#13;
loans and certainly very little room for any risk factor.       New spreads for&#13;
developing countries who annually receive massive foreign aid for debt&#13;
rescheduling allow them to borrow at 0.75 percent over LIBOR, whereas&#13;
13/    American Banker (20 August 1981).&#13;
14/    Five of the top ten most profitable banks in the United States (income&#13;
per share) are outside the top thirty U.S. banks, and these banks&#13;
probably tend to rely heavily on domestic business.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
borrowers can raise funds at 0.25 percent over LIBOR or less.           Governor&#13;
Wallich of the Federal Reserve interprets the fact that in 1981 lending to&#13;
developing countries has grown, even with no rise in spreads, as evidence that&#13;
"the borrowing is very attractive to the bankers engaging in it.... if not,&#13;
why should they be lending at rates that seem hardly remunerative?"      15/  Why&#13;
indeed?&#13;
One reason (which Governor Wallich goes on to point out) must derive&#13;
from the rewards from other relationships or collateral benefits involved (see&#13;
the first subsection of Section II). There has been very little widening in&#13;
the range of U.S. banks that participate in the market outside of the twenty-&#13;
four larger banks that account for 83 percent of U.S. bank loans to developing&#13;
countries.   If we assume that the twenty-four larger banks have much stronger&#13;
developing country relationships, then this may be evidence of the influence&#13;
of such additional benefits on the assessment of profitability.&#13;
Bank Balance Sheet Data&#13;
Comprehensive analysis prepared by Salomon Brothers 16/ provides&#13;
more detailed evidence (for U.S. banks only) of the apparent profitability of&#13;
international banking. Two tables are reproduced here.&#13;
The first, Table 15, suggests an average "spread" of 1.5 to 2.25&#13;
percent, but with the spread itself varying considerably from bank to bank&#13;
(from above 4 percent to below 1 percent).     The average spread rose in 1980&#13;
from the 1.5 percent low at end 1979.&#13;

The second, Table 16, also indicates a wide range of profitability&#13;
on loans in different countries, with notably higher spreads in developing&#13;
countries.   These spreads may not directly reflect net profitability, since&#13;
different taxes and the like will affect the net return to banks, but overall&#13;
spreads in developing countries are (according to this data) some 2 to 3&#13;
percentage points higher than in industrial countries.    The data, of course,&#13;
cover exposures to government and private borrowers.    Banks   local customers&#13;
in developing countries will tend to be in the private sector and thus hold a&#13;
totally different risk/reward perspective.&#13;

Bank-by-bank   analysis   is   the  ideal   means   to  identify   the&#13;
profitability of international activities.    For the largest five U.S. banks,&#13;
profitability items as a percentage of international earning assets rose for&#13;
three of these banks from mid-1979 to mid-1980 and on average rose slightly&#13;
from 0.70 percent to 0.72 percent (year-end 1979: 0.65 percent). 17/&#13;
Influence of Profitability on Bank Lending to Developing Countries&#13;
Lending to developing countries, alongside other bank/developing&#13;
country business,   has clearly been attractive for banks so far.         Future&#13;
lending will depend upon future profitability.     Two variables may reduce the&#13;
attractiveness of this business:&#13;
17/    Mid-year balance sheets will not be directly comparable to end-year&#13;
totals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
*   Higher profits obtainable in other markets (e.g., in&#13;
domestic OECD markets) that attract funds away from&#13;
developing countries&#13;
*   Higher actual or expected losses on developing country&#13;
loans that reduce actual or expected net income of&#13;
banks from developing country business.&#13;
If these changes do occur, then the flow of funds would only increase if its&#13;
profitability rises (e.g., spreads rise on syndicated credits) or if losses&#13;
are limited by more government guarantees on bank loans (but see Section V for&#13;
reservations on the various guarantee proposals).&#13;
Already in 1981 some borrowers have amply demonstrated how a rise in&#13;
spreads can increase the amount of available credit.   Equally, there have been&#13;
reschedulings of debt, effectively at a running loss for banks, that will&#13;
harden attitudes to developing country risk.     And even spreads at 4 percent&#13;
plus do not give adequate protection if a full default occurs.         If those&#13;
pessimistic on country risk prove correct, then apparent profitability may be&#13;
a chimera (hence certain fears for the health of the banking system).      It is&#13;
tempting to accept Governor Wallich's suggestion that lending must be&#13;
profitable  and  continue  to  be  so or   banks would not    lend.    The main&#13;
qualification must be that in the early 1980s banks will be discovering the&#13;
time profitability of developing country lending (i.e., building up some&#13;
developing country credit risk experience and losses).        Spreads may rise&#13;
selectively as a result of this experience,      and, given the depth of the&#13;
Bank/developing country relationship, the lending should continue to be&#13;
attractive.&#13;
IV. Constraints on Bank Lending to Developing Countries&#13;
Aside from the squeeze on spreads on loans to developing countries,&#13;
a number of other factors have been cited as possible constraints on future&#13;
bank lending to developing countries:&#13;
*   Country limits (are they now being reached?)&#13;
*   Country risk perceptions (are banks becoming more wary&#13;
of developing country lending after a series of debt&#13;
reschedulings?)&#13;
*   Capital adequacy (are the banks' future growth plans&#13;
seriously constrained by falling capital ratios?)&#13;
*   Regulations (will the banks' regulators act in a way&#13;
that will discourage lending to developing countries?)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
Country Limits&#13;
Banks impose limits on lending to specific countries as a measure of&#13;
internal prudential asset control. There is not always a formal definition of&#13;
what limits should be, but in general they relate to capital and to total&#13;
assets.   In the case of U.S. banks, the U.S. National Banking Act indicates&#13;
that loans to one entity ought not to exceed 10 percent of capital plus&#13;
surplus and retained earnings.     But is a country a single "entity"?     Moves&#13;
have been made to achieve some agreement as to how the law should apply to&#13;
country exposure (e.g., by the "means and purpose" test). 18/ New York State,&#13;
for example, suggests a ceiling of 25 percent of capital for exposure to&#13;
governments.&#13;
Banks' internal country limits are not published, and there is no&#13;
way of analyzing how far the market is up to its limit.         Undoubtedly, the&#13;
limits  are  being  reached  for  some  banks with   some countries.     Further&#13;
extensive borrowing by those countries will require an expansion of the number&#13;
of banks willing to take exposure and probably higher returns to banks.      Some&#13;
banks may deliberately keep a low profile at times, waiting until other banks&#13;
are "full up" before they become significant lenders.&#13;
In the same way that the developing country debt position cannot be&#13;
properly analyzed in aggregate, all banks cannot be analyzed as a group. The&#13;
banking system in total does not have a country limit problem; potentially&#13;
more country debt can be absorbed by banks who have yet to be very active in&#13;
international lending. No developing country accounts for more than 3 percent&#13;
of total assets of the international banking system.        But while a single&#13;
country's debt is not, per se, high enough to result in a potential limit&#13;
problem for the banking system, the limit may be reached for individual&#13;
banks. Exposure is certainly rising.&#13;
18/    The "means and purpose"    test was devised to overcome the following&#13;
problem.   A government may borrow through a group of state-owned or&#13;
government institutions (e.g., the State Oil Company, the Central&#13;
Bank).   It might thus be said that each separate borrower is operating&#13;
as a separate entity.     This would mean loans to the country could&#13;
exceed any capital-related ceiling simply by borrowing through a number&#13;
of entities.   Clearly, if the foreign exchange to repay debts of all&#13;
state borrowers comes from a common source (e.g., the Central Bank and&#13;
the Oil Company may use oil revenues to repay foreign debts), then it&#13;
may be inappropriate to regard each borrower as a separate entity. The&#13;
"means and purpose"    test seeks to define the extent to which each&#13;
borrower has such independent means by which to service debts.&#13;
Furthermore, both entities may be borrowing for the same project (e.g.,&#13;
a national pipeline). The test seeks to define whether the purpose of&#13;
each borrowing is independent (if not, then again the claim of separate&#13;
entities may be less justifiable).     For a fuller explanation and the&#13;
details of the regulations, see Appendix I in Offshore Lending by U.S.&#13;
Commercial Banks, ed. F. J. Mathis (Bankers Association for Foreign&#13;
Trade and Robert Morris Associates, 1981).&#13;

In 1980, the nine largest U.S. banks' exposure to non-oil developing&#13;
countries represented 204 percent of gross capital funds compared with 156&#13;
percent in 1977. 19/   For the fifteen next largest banks, the ratio rose from&#13;
105 percent   in 1977 to 129 percent in 1980, while other banks showed a&#13;
relatively stable, 61 percent ratio of non-oil developing country assets to&#13;
capital.&#13;
Federal Reserve Survey data also indicate that in June 1979 there&#13;
were only thirty-six instances where a U.S. bank had exposure to one single&#13;
developing country in excess of 30 percent of capital funds. This number had&#13;
reached eighty by -end 1980.     Country exposure, even if not above country&#13;
limits, certainly is getting closer to prudential limits in many cases.&#13;
Three further "country limit" points should be made.         First,  a&#13;
country limit is not a single variable.      A bank's country limit will have&#13;
several categories, reflecting different types of business exposures:      e.g.,&#13;
in maturity (e.g., short-term limit and medium-term limit); in an individual&#13;
borrower's limit (e.g., limits for banks, corporate and state entities); and&#13;
in relating to offsetting liabilities.     A cross-country limit must also be&#13;
distinguished from domestic currency limits (the latter being a function of&#13;
bank capital in offices in other countries and reflecting the size of domestic&#13;
currency assets, themselves funded by domestic currency liabilities).&#13;
Use of each sub-limit will change according to circumstances.      For&#13;
example, there is often a natural inclination, when the term limit is full up,&#13;
to restrict business to short-term credits.    While such action may be prudent&#13;
for the bank, this inclination can be dangerous for the market and for the&#13;
borrower if short-term credits   are a borrower's stop-gap against an eventual&#13;
debt crisis (a crisis then of larger proportions due to the short-term debt&#13;
build-up).&#13;
Second, country limits may be exceeded involuntarily -- e.g., when&#13;
the borrower has to refinance existing debt payments (amortization plus&#13;
interest) to remain solvent.    Although the relending of maturing assets does&#13;
not increase the banks' exposure, if the bank virtually has little option but&#13;
to allow the borrower to roll up interest, then the country exposure will&#13;
increase.    In  setting  the  limits,  therefore,  cognizance   of  this  self-&#13;
generating aspect of a country exposure has to be taken into account.&#13;
Third, the bank will also pay close regard (for both risk and reward&#13;
reasons) to net exposures as well as gross exposures.    Although deposits from&#13;
the borrower do not (normally) offer offsetting collateral for loans, a $30&#13;
million exposure with no deposits from the borrower may be regarded with&#13;
greater prudential concern than $30 million offset by $10 million of deposits&#13;
(not least because a $10 million deposit does indicate that the borrower has&#13;
some  liquidity).     And  the  reward   aspect  of  the  $10  million   deposit&#13;
(particularly in the case of free balances) may make $30 million offset by $10&#13;
million a more profitable combination than a $20 million loan with no deposits&#13;
(even though the risk is unaffected). The $30 million loan/$10 million&#13;

deposit will, however, require a larger balance sheet than the straight $20&#13;
million loan.&#13;
Country Risk Perception&#13;
The concept of "country risk perception," like confidence, is one of&#13;
the most   important  yet incalculable variables    in banking.     A change in&#13;
perception of risk by banks can reduce the availability of funds to developing&#13;
countries without a change in country limits.     In many cases a perception of&#13;
higher risks may only affect the price of available credit, but for several&#13;
"periphery" developing country borrowers availability at any price may fall.&#13;
Country risk perception can directly affect the flow of funds to&#13;
developing countries in two ways.     First, if banks have less confidence in&#13;
developing countries' (in general or particular) ability to honor their debts,&#13;
they may be increasingly reluctant to lend to developing countries (even if&#13;
the  actual  outlook   for  developing  countries   remains  unchanged).    Such&#13;
declining confidence typically might be generated by country-risk shocks&#13;
(e.g., the crises in Iran, Poland, Nicaragua).&#13;
Second, if developing countries do build a poor record in debt&#13;
servicing, banks may find the actual risks higher as measured by loan losses&#13;
and thus only lend against higher rewards.      With over a dozen reschedulings&#13;
occurring on bank debt since 1975, the actual risks appear to be rising.&#13;
Changes in risk perception eventually make themselves felt through&#13;
country limits, through desired profitability spreads on loans.      To date the&#13;
loan loss record on sovereign credits, and indeed on international lending,&#13;
has been better than on domestic business (e.g., consumer financing, property&#13;
financing). But risk perception on developing country debt has increased. In&#13;
1975, commentators stressed how banks were improving their portfolios by&#13;
lending to sovereign borrowers.&#13;
By 1979, the Federal Reserve Board in its Annual Report cited non-&#13;
oil developing country debts as one in four main concerns with respect to&#13;
quality of bank assets (the other three being consumer credit, "two large U.S.&#13;
corporations," and municipalities).&#13;
Political factors have also crept into the equation more forcibly&#13;
than in the past, as a result of the Iranian and Nicaraguan revolutions. Both&#13;
crises were the first occasions since the Cuban revolution when bank lending&#13;
has been in jeopardy primarily as a result of political (rather than&#13;
financial) developments.   For Iran (and for a time in Nicaragua), it was not&#13;
the country's financial ability to repay that was primarily in doubt but its&#13;
political willingness to repay that became uncertain. 20/&#13;
In relation to these events, the U.S. administration's freeze on&#13;
Iranian assets, a politically motivated action, also threatened the Euromarket&#13;
20/    It is often pointed out that sovereign risk lending is different from&#13;
all other lending precisely because banks or courts can hardly seize&#13;
the "assets" of a defaulting country.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
in three respects.    First, depositors (especially OPEC) were now more than&#13;
ever acutely aware of the political risk associated with the domicile of their&#13;
financial assets.   Second, within the market the political influence of OECD&#13;
governments over constituent parts of the Euromarket was felt.        Third, the&#13;
question of offsetting loans by deposits in the case of default or dispute&#13;
became a real rather than hypothetical issue in sovereign risk lending.&#13;
Fortunately, the worst fears over the possible damage to the&#13;
operation of the Euromarket emanating from the Iran freeze were not&#13;
fulfilled. The very special political background to the United States/Iran&#13;
dispute seems to have prevented a "demonstration effect" feeding through to&#13;
the rest of the market.&#13;
In conclusion, attitude to risk is critical to market sentiment, and&#13;
to portfolio choice (assets and liabilities) on the part of banks.        It can&#13;
also influence the ratios of the banks themselves, which could affect the&#13;
raising of new capital.    In the immediate future, greater risk perception ls&#13;
one factor encouraging the widening of the differential in spreads offered to&#13;
different borrowers. In the longer run, risk perception is likely to show its&#13;
most noticeable change as and when country-risk problems feed through to the&#13;
"bottom line," through actual losses on sovereign credits.&#13;
Capital Adequacy&#13;
A major issue now felt to be affecting banks' capacity to lend to&#13;
developing countries in 1981 and beyond is the question of banks' "capital&#13;
adequacy."   The most often repeated statement is that the "banks' capital&#13;
ratios have been deteriorating since 1973 and therefore cannot withstand the&#13;
recycling task the second time."&#13;
Examination of the evidence suggests that there is justification for&#13;
this claim, that declining capital ratios may reduce banks' ability to lend to&#13;
developing countries and ability to take on OPEC deposits.        But the thesis&#13;
must be treated with great caution.     Capital ratio trends differ widely from&#13;
banking group to banking group, and even for U.S. banks the trend is not&#13;
clearly downwards.    "Capital adequacy" is not an intrinsic value in itself:&#13;
capital-adequacy levels can only be judged in relation to the quality and&#13;
quantity of assets and liabilities being built upon the capital base.&#13;
With this in mind, the evidence and then the influence of capital&#13;
questions on bank lending can be commented on in turn.      First, the evidence.&#13;
There has been a steady decline in capital ratios. U.K. banks' ratios seem to&#13;
have fallen in the mid-1970s,     since then to have stabilized.      The steady&#13;
decline in Japanese banks' ratios (like that of U.S. banks) has been&#13;
arrested.   Italian banks' capital ratio declines have been reversed by the&#13;
introduction of credit rationing.     German ratios have appeared stable, but&#13;
this may be due to the growth of loans booked in Luxembourg.       Several major&#13;
U.S. banks show improving capital ratios since 1976.      Nevertheless, analyses&#13;
generally conclude that there has been some, but not a dramatic, decline in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
capital ratios. 21/    There is, undeniably, official and private concern that&#13;
the low level of ratios may be a constraint in future lending. Capital ratios&#13;
may only have been maintained by raising new capital in the form of new debt&#13;
issues -- the whole definition of capital itself is indeed a major issue&#13;
underlying the growth of banks in the 1980s.&#13;
Second, whatever the trends in capital ratios (and the evidence of&#13;
declining capital ratios is mixed), the quality of portfolios and management&#13;
must be analyzed before reaching any judgment for capital "adequacy" (i.e.,&#13;
adequate for what?)    Given the expansion of foreign business as a percentage&#13;
of banks' assets (with its possible implication of a growth in higher risk&#13;
assets), banks' capital ratios should perhaps, if anything, be increasing&#13;
(capital being, after earnings, the second-line defense against loss).&#13;
The question,   therefore,  is:    Have  the  significant  changes  in&#13;
balance sheets, in the mix between domestic 'and foreign assets of banks,&#13;
affected the required levels of capital?&#13;
*   Impact on retained earnings:    Banks' retained earnings&#13;
make a significant contribution to new capital.        If&#13;
foreign assets generate less returns, due to developing&#13;
country debt problems and falling spreads on Euroloans,&#13;
will this source of capital decline?&#13;
*   Foreign assets as percentage of total assets:     Is this&#13;
a constraint?   Is there a desired prudential limit to&#13;
the ratio of foreign to domestic assets? Does the rise&#13;
in this ratio call for greater capital protection?&#13;
*   Ability to raise new capital:       Does the shift into&#13;
foreign assets affect the ability of the banks to raise&#13;
new capital (e.g., by raising the cost of new capital)?&#13;
Effect on Retained Earnings&#13;
From the developing country risk component of reward, there is to&#13;
date little reason to suggest that foreign lending is less profitable than&#13;
domestic lending, and the reverse has probably been the case in the 1970s.&#13;
Because a high proportion of assets are with sovereign entities (on which&#13;
there has been a much better credit record than on domestic borrowers), then&#13;
the net return should be improved.     Against this it can be argued that risk&#13;
could be perceived to be potentially high, since banks' ability to collect&#13;
from a defaulting government is uncertain and legal jurisdiction over foreign&#13;
debtors is not always clear.     Furthermore, the superior loan-loss record on&#13;
sovereign credits compared with domestic portfolios may not continue in the&#13;
1970s, given the growing number of reschedulings.&#13;
Indeed, what is the cost to the bank of rescheduling a sovereign&#13;
credit?   If the bank is "locked" in to a country (default being the only&#13;
21/    See   the  bibliography   for   references  on   capital  ratio   studies,&#13;
especially those of IBCA and Revell.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
recourse to the borrower if refinancing is not made available), then the bank&#13;
may relend at a considerably lower return than otherwise would be sought for a&#13;
similarly uncreditworthy entity (an opportunity "loss" or cost).     It might be&#13;
argued that, where the bank envisages a long-term banking relationship with a&#13;
borrower (and allows for some refinancing problems at some stage), then this&#13;
opportunity "loss" may be perceived to be neither wholly unexpected nor unduly&#13;
damaging to the bank.&#13;
In the longer term, as more countries are forced to refinance&#13;
existing debts or default, then the significance of the opportunity loss could&#13;
rise.    Banks  will  account  for  such  losses  in their write-offs    (albeit&#13;
undeclared publicly) on sovereign credits, thereby reducing retained earnings.&#13;
A further twist to the aspect of opportunity loss is that many loans&#13;
have an accompanying reward to the bank from contractors and the like in the&#13;
deal in the form of initial fees.    The underlying syndicated credit may thus&#13;
be attractive,   given  these  additional  "sweeteners."    Such  fees are not&#13;
repeated in the rescheduling.    Thus, the rate of return is not only lower in&#13;
opportunity cost, it is lower because the margin is then the only return to&#13;
the bank, the original fees being a one-time profit or return on the asset.&#13;
So far, although spreads have been squeezed on international&#13;
syndicated credits, comfort can be derived from the superior risk and good&#13;
record to date.    But in the future any worsening of the developing country&#13;
credit record and continuation of fine spreads may increasingly threaten&#13;
capital growth through lower retained earnings on foreign activities.&#13;
Foreign Assets as a Percentage of Total Assets:&#13;
A Constraint?&#13;
The fast growth of international banking has had a counterpart in an&#13;
increase in the ratio of foreign to domestic assets for several market&#13;
participants.   The constraint on this ratio will ultimately be the ability of&#13;
the  bank  to  manage   such  a  portfolio.    Expanding  branch/representative&#13;
networks, and the growth of regional financial centers where banks run their&#13;
own regional   offices,  should  assist  in the management    of these   foreign&#13;
-assets.  For banks with less of a commitment to foreign business (and less&#13;
able to invest in more extensive management techniques), the ability to expand&#13;
foreign assets as a percentage of total assets will be highly price-&#13;
sensitive.   Further,  as banks continue to categorize their portfolios by&#13;
different groups of risk, then a variety of constraints may be felt (e.g.,&#13;
political developments may shape the future of a Central American portfolio, a&#13;
COMECON portfolio, or an Arab/Islamic/OPEC portfolio).      But until the loan-&#13;
loss record in international lending proves substantially worse, then a market&#13;
rise in capital adequacy is unlikely to be needed purely as a result of the&#13;
higher share of foreign to domestic assets.&#13;
Ability to Raise New Capital&#13;
The growth of foreign assets may have a significant impact on the&#13;
ability to raise new capital.    An individual bank may be satisfied with its&#13;
abilty to manage its expanding international loan portfolio, but the&#13;
investor/shareholder may be far less sanguine.     Confidence in bank assets is&#13;
thus influenced strongly (certainly in the short term) by shocks (such as in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
Iran and Nicaragua).     With the so-called "developing country debt crisis"&#13;
still unresolved in the public mind, continued wariness of bank stocks may&#13;
continue.   To discourage this trend, banks themselves may remain cautious in&#13;
expanding developing country exposures, particularly if the capital constraint&#13;
is also binding for the particular bank.&#13;
Central Bank Action/Regulatory Activities&#13;
The question of regulation in the Euromarket is a very complex&#13;
subject and involves a number of legal and official policy questions.        This&#13;
subsection briefly describes the present state of play with respect to&#13;
regulating bank lending to developing countries; it does not attempt to&#13;
provide full details on each central bank's actions.&#13;
Central banks' and regulators' actions      can be divided into two&#13;
categories.    First,  there are those actions by the regulators       to ensure&#13;
prudent and sound lending practices by banks under their jurisdiction.&#13;
Second, there are those actions taken by central banks to influence capital&#13;
flows on their own balance of payments, implying that actions affect lending&#13;
activities of their own banks.     A few examples of the major central banks'&#13;
attitudes and actions will illustrate the main points involved.&#13;
First, U.S. banks probably operate under the most formal and&#13;
stringent  regulations   with  respect  to  international  lending.     The U.S.&#13;
authorities have been active both in promoting good credit analysis by U.S.&#13;
banks, in ensuring full reporting by U.S. banks of their exposure to&#13;
individual countries, and by ensuring standard approaches to credit policy and&#13;
loan quality control.    The U.S. example serves to illustrate that, however&#13;
well the central bank regulates its own banking system and however detailed&#13;
the reporting, the net result can only be to ensure that banks themselves make&#13;
good banking decisions.     Hard and fast rules on lending can hardly replace&#13;
good credit judgment.&#13;
An excellent example of this necessary flexibility is provided by&#13;
the U.S. regulators' attitude to government guarantees. The U.S. regulators,&#13;
in applying the "means and purpose" test, 22/ seek to ensure that when a bank&#13;
claims that different borrowers within the same country are separate entities&#13;
(and thus can be regarded as separate "persons" under U.S. law), this separate&#13;
nature or autonomy of the borrower does exist in practice. Nevertheless, the&#13;
common practice of countries -- to give overall government guarantees to their&#13;
different public-sector entities when borrowing in the market -- raises a&#13;
paradox.   If the bank is claiming that the different public-sector entities&#13;
are separate, but at the same time obtains a guarantee from the central bank&#13;
or Ministry   of Finance,   how real is that separateness?      The regulators'&#13;
response has been that, although they notice the paradox, they would not wish&#13;
the "means and purpose" test to be interpreted in such a way that this&#13;
discourages banks from taking such a central government guarantee when it is&#13;
available.   This would seem to violate the spirit of the "means and purpose"&#13;
test but recognizes that the ultimate aim is to ensure a good loan portfolio&#13;
with respect to the ultimate guarantor.&#13;
22/    See footnote 18, above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
The case of Germany is rather different from that of the United&#13;
States.   Existing bank lending data cover less than 40 percent of medium- to&#13;
long-term Euroloans granted by German banking groups on a roll-over basis&#13;
because of the extensive use of subsidiaries rather than branches.       In line&#13;
with the BIS initiatives, the Bundesbank is moving toward consolidated&#13;
reporting of German banks assets and liabilities whether booked in Germany or&#13;
in outside financial centers (e.g., Luxembourg).       Until this is done, it&#13;
clearly will be difficult to ensure that comprehensive regulation such as&#13;
those carried out by the U.S. authorities can be performed in the same&#13;
detailed way.&#13;
The question of consolidation of balance sheets raises further&#13;
points over the jurisdiction of the individual central banks:    Does a central&#13;
bank have jurisdiction just for its own national banks in its own national&#13;
territory, or should it be regulating foreign banks operating in its own&#13;
territory?   The Bank of England is in the most special position in this&#13;
regard, since it has a dual responsibility for ensuring that U.K. banks are&#13;
well managed and for ensuring that the London Euromarket, effectively under&#13;
the Bank of England's protective wing, remains a healthy financial market.&#13;
Actions by the Bank of Japan illustrate central bank initiatives to&#13;
control the balance of payments. The Bank of Japan at times limits the extent&#13;
to which Japanese banks are allowed to participate in syndicated credits&#13;
(sometimes restricting the amount to as low as 12.5 percent of any new&#13;
credit).   The Ministry of Finance establishes (confidential) quotas for each&#13;
bank based on performance.    The basic quotas awarded in April 1980 (totaling&#13;
around $2 billion on a drawn-down basis, or $4 billion on a commitment basis)&#13;
certainly restricted Japanese banks    foreign lending.   In addition, the Bank&#13;
of Japan restricts from time to time the use of the domestic Yen market for&#13;
lending to international institutions.     (The Bundesbank also takes similar&#13;
actions to control the international use of the Deutschemark.) Bank of Japan&#13;
action has also been taken, due to the "rate cutting war," to ensure that&#13;
Japanese   banks   are  neither   taking   action  detrimental   to   their  own&#13;
profitability interests or to the interests of Japanese banks in the market as&#13;
a whole. After the Herstatt crisis of 1974 and the oil crisis, Japanese banks&#13;
tended to suffer from a tiering of deposit rates more than other banks, to the&#13;
extent that certain syndicated loans were earning a negative spread for&#13;
Japanese banks.&#13;
Other questions of regulation have arisen concerning Euromarket&#13;
lending to developing countries. At one stage, there was considerable concern&#13;
over the inflationary potential of the Euromarket, and therefore a concern to&#13;
control the growth of this market for macroeconomic reasons.      These aspects&#13;
now seem to have faded, and the greater concern is over maintaining a healthy&#13;
banking system.&#13;

V. The Future: Some Pointers&#13;
This final section seeks to draw together the analysis into&#13;
concluding remarks on the future of bank lending to developing countries.&#13;
Particular attention is given to the role of Arab banks and to the possible&#13;
flow of funds to developing countries.&#13;
Flow of Private Bank Funds to Developing Countries, 1980-85&#13;
The analysis uses as its framework the Amex Bank Private Capital&#13;
Market Model 23/ and provides projections for developing country borrowing&#13;
from private banks to 1985 and accompanying debt service ratios, reserve&#13;
levels,  and balance-of-payments   positions.   A 16.5 percent annual average&#13;
LIBOR is used.&#13;
Trade assumptions&#13;
The analysis assumes that in 1981/82 imports of non-OPEC developing&#13;
countries will be constrained by policy choices and also that imports will not&#13;
grow as rapidly as in the past because of the present oil glut.     From 1982-85&#13;
imports are expected to pick up rather faster and to grow at the same pace as&#13;
exports (19 percent a year in nominal terms).         This scenario leads to a&#13;
falling trade gap as a percentage of merchandise exports, but in nominal&#13;
dollar terms the gap widens from $90 billion in 1980 to $156 billion in 1985.&#13;
Reserves&#13;
Over this period developing countries will, country by country, be&#13;
operating under a number of constraints. First, what level of reserves should&#13;
be maintained?   (At present this group as a whole has reserves sufficient to&#13;
cover just over two months of imports.)    Second, how rapidly can private bank&#13;
lending be expected to grow? And third, how rapidly will developing countries&#13;
wish to increase their import levels (with respect to economic growth&#13;
targets)?&#13;
Basic Findings&#13;
Four simulations of the model were carried out (see Tables 17-20),&#13;
and the conclusions are drawn as follows:&#13;
*   The above trade picture can be financed, with only a 12&#13;
percent annual increase in bank outstanding assets with&#13;
developing countries, as long as current reserves at&#13;
2.1 months of imports are not increased back to 3&#13;
months   of  imports.     Under  this  first   simulation&#13;
(Table 17), total debt of non-OPEC developing countries&#13;
rises from $373 million in 1980 to $666 million at end&#13;
1985 (net), and lending by banks averaged 12 percent a&#13;
23/    See  M.   Adam  Parkin,  "The  LDC  Debt   Burden  1979-1986,"  Euromoney&#13;
March 1980), for a brief explanation of the model.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

year.   The debt-service ratio declines slightly to 18&#13;
percent by 1985 from the current 19 percent.&#13;
*   In the second simulation (Table 18) it is assumed that&#13;
developing   countries  will   wish  to   restore  their&#13;
previous liquidity levels, as they have done in the&#13;
past, to three months    import coverage by 1984. As a&#13;
result, the borrowing requirement increases and total&#13;
debt rises to $748 million by 1985.     The debt-service&#13;
ratio does not decline and rises slightly to almost 20&#13;
percent.    The growth   of outstanding   debt to banks&#13;
averages 17 percent a year over the period.&#13;
*   Third  (Table   19),  it  is   assumed  that  developing&#13;
countries may wish to increase their imports somewhat&#13;
faster.   As a result, the borrowing requirement will&#13;
increase.   If, for example, an additional increase in&#13;
imports of only 1 percent a year is desirable (and this&#13;
could' be forced upon developing countries via price&#13;
increases, or it could be a matter of choice with&#13;
respect to faster domestic growth targets), then debt&#13;
rises to $852 million by 1985.    The debt-service ratio&#13;
rises to above 22 percent.      To finance this -- if,&#13;
compared with the other simulations, no additional&#13;
funding is available from official sources -- then&#13;
lending by banks will have to increase to 21 percent a&#13;
year compared with the lower levels in the previous&#13;
simulations.&#13;
*   Finally (Table 20), if the 21 percent annual growth in&#13;
bank lending is not available, or if the debt position&#13;
of $852 million is thought unacceptable, then the&#13;
three-month liquidity requirement might be eased.&#13;
Keeping reserves at 2.1 months of imports, as in the&#13;
first simulation, would result in total debt of $768&#13;
million by 1985 and an annual rise in debt to banks of&#13;
18 percent.&#13;

Since the 1973 oil crisis, private bank lending has been growing at&#13;
30 percent a year (net) to non-OPEC developing countries.     It may be assumed&#13;
that in subsequent years this growth will be slower because of the various&#13;
constraints on bank lending and because the previous growth period was from a&#13;
rather lower base.   Nonetheless, the advent of new institutions (for example,&#13;
the Arab banks) does hold out some hope that the growth rate in subsequent&#13;
years is not going to be substantially less than in the past (in nominal&#13;
terms).   Thus the 21 percent annual growth necessary to meet the financing&#13;
target in the third simulation might be regarded as the upper end of the band,&#13;
and the 12 percent a year in private bank lending should be easily achieved.&#13;
The impact on borrowing of either a restoration of three months liquidity&#13;
level or adding 1 percent a year to imports is roughly identical.&#13;
All these simulations do not project a significant increase in the&#13;
growth of official multinational financing of developing countries deficits,&#13;
with the net flow in 1985 from non-bank services (including direct investment&#13;
of about $10 billion) being $85 billion compared with a net flow of $51&#13;
billion in 1980. If official funding can rise sharply (these assumptions give&#13;
a 12 percent a year rise in debt to official institutions), then a further&#13;
easing of the debt burden could be achieved.&#13;
Arab Bank Lending to Developing Countries&#13;
Arab banks are the most significant newcomers in the market and thus&#13;
warrant close study. 24/ In the same way that German and Japanese banks took&#13;
up more of the lending activity after U.S. banks began to fill up their&#13;
limits, so other new banks such as the Arab banks are attracted to the&#13;
developing country market.&#13;
A considerable amount of capital has been invested in Arab banks&#13;
since 1973. The total participation of Arab banks in syndicated loans to date&#13;
is estimated   at $12 billion, small compared     to capital.    There is some&#13;
justification for assuming that new Arab banks have considerable new lending&#13;
capacity.   The capital/asset ratios of ten leading Arab-gwned banks (at end&#13;
1979) fall within a wide range from 1.19 percent to 8.83 percent.         Their&#13;
combined capital of $1.8 billion amounted at end 1979 to 4.8 percent of assets&#13;
($36.9 billion).   Half of the ten banks showed capital/asset ratios above 5&#13;
percent.&#13;
Although it was a fairly widely held view that Arab banks would&#13;
become an increasingly important force in international lending, there were&#13;
considerable doubts that Arab banks would be willing to lend to developing&#13;
countries. Recent data compiled for this study (Table 21) suggest that these&#13;
doubts were misplaced and that Arab banks are rapidly becoming major lenders&#13;
to developing countries.  First, the analysis covers the role of Arab banks as&#13;
lead managers in syndicated credits; second, it details the role of Arab banks&#13;
as loan managers (in effect one tier further down from lead management).&#13;
24/    Market Journals and news magazines such as Euromoney, International&#13;
Investor, and Middle East Economic Digest carry useful, up-to-date&#13;
surveys of Arab banking: see the bibliography for recent studies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

On the basis of their lead management role, Arab banks have&#13;
increased their participation from $1.1 billion in 1976 to $3.8 billion in&#13;
1980 and $4 billion in the first seven months of 1981.    Over the period 1976&#13;
to the present, Arab banks lead-managed loans to the value of $15 billion.&#13;
(This calculation of lead management contribution assumes that each lead&#13;
manager in the loan takes on an equal percentage of the total loan. A number&#13;
of these loans will, of course, be passed on down through the participation&#13;
group to Arab and non-Arab banks.)&#13;

On the basis of loan management (the second measure; i.e.,&#13;
management), the volume of Arab banks has risen from $0.5 billion in 1976 to&#13;
$4 billion in 1980 and $3.2 billion in the first seven months of 1981.     Over&#13;
the period, total management of loans reached $12.8 billion.&#13;
With respect to the developing country share of Arab bank lending,&#13;
in 1976 non-oil developing countries accounted for only 3 percent of lead&#13;
management positions by Arab banks. This ratio had risen to 32 percent of the&#13;
total by 1980.  For management positions, non-oil developing countries    share&#13;
has risen from 11 percent in 1976 to 22 percent in 1980.&#13;

The increased share of Arab banks' exposure to non-oil developing&#13;
countries has as its counterpart a reduction in the proportion of Arab bank&#13;
lending going to OECD countries; it represents a much less heavy reliance upon&#13;
borrowers in OPEC and Islamic/Arab countries to provide Arab banks with&#13;
assets. In 1977/78, OPEC/Islamic/Arab borrowers accounted for over 80 percent&#13;
of lead management by Arab banks. By 1980 this rate had fallen to 25 percent.&#13;
Principal country data are provided in Table 22. It shows that the&#13;
largest single borrowing countries from Arab banks (taking lead management&#13;
positions) are Saudi Arabia, Morocco, and Spain (all above $1 billion). Italy&#13;
is close to $1 billion, and Algeria and Brazil are over $700 million.&#13;

A Banking Crisis? Possibilities and Prevention&#13;
The question of an international banking crisis, set off by&#13;
excessive lending to developing countries, has remained a point of debate from&#13;
the mid-1970s into the early 1980s.      Such a crisis, or anticipation of a&#13;
problem in lending to developing countries, could have a major effect upon&#13;
future availability of funds to developing countries from private credit and&#13;
capital markets. The general points made in the debate are summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
Optimistic points:&#13;
*   There  have  been no   full-scale  defaults as such by&#13;
developing countries in the 1980s.&#13;
*   The   loan-loss  record  on   international  lending   to&#13;
sovereign borrowers has been much better than any other&#13;
loan-loss record in other sectors of the banking credit&#13;
market.&#13;
*   Several   countries  have  been   successfully  able   to&#13;
reschedule debts without setting off any major crises&#13;
for banks.&#13;
*   The so-called domino theory -- of one country's problem&#13;
setting off a chain reaction elsewhere -- has not been&#13;
borne out.   Back in 1976 there was talk of a general&#13;
moratorium on developing country debt.     This fear has&#13;
proved to be unfounded, not least because the idea that&#13;
developing countries are a coherent and homogeneous&#13;
economic group is a false one.&#13;
Pessimistic points:&#13;
*   Banks' exposure to developing countries is undoubtedly&#13;
increasing.&#13;
*   The number of reschedulings     of sovereign borrowers'&#13;
debt has been increasing, even if there have been no&#13;
actual defaults.&#13;
*   There are still countries whose debt-servicing problems&#13;
have yet to go away, even though their existing debts&#13;
have been rescheduled.&#13;
*   The market's ability to withstand a number of small&#13;
reschedulings (the record to date) does not necessarily&#13;
prove that, if a major borrower with a very large debt&#13;
to banks ran into problems, this amount of rescheduling&#13;
could be absorbed so easily.&#13;
*   The  demand  for borrowing   from developing   countries&#13;
continues   to  be   high,  with   persistent  recession&#13;
affecting  the   developing  countries'   markets,  with&#13;
nominal and real interest rates high, and with progress&#13;
achieved in reducing oil imports only limited. Thus, a&#13;
high new borrowing requirement is now being built on&#13;
top of an existing high level of external debt.&#13;
But, if a major developing country debt crisis should occur for&#13;
whatever reason, what defenses do the banks and their governments have to&#13;
prevent a worldwide banking collapse?     First, banks are continuing to make&#13;
reserves against international lending, varying considerably from year to&#13;
year.   This is the primary defense mechanism.     Second, banks are reporting&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
moves to greater liquidity in their worldwide portfolio, reducing the average&#13;
maturities of loan and investment security portfolios. Third, banks are, on a&#13;
case-by-case basis, applying country limits more stringently (for developing&#13;
countries  and  COMECON).    As  long  as banks continue    to account   for any&#13;
developing country risk in their balance sheets (and this so far is the case),&#13;
then banks' defenses against crisis should remain firm (but there will always&#13;
be exceptions).&#13;
On the official side, the statements of the BIS after Herstatt are&#13;
very important.   At that time it was stated that "it is not practical to lay&#13;
down detailed rules and procedure for provision of temporary liquidity..., but&#13;
we are satisfied that means are available for their purpose and will be used&#13;
if and when necessary." 25/     Central banks do appear ready to stabilize the&#13;
market in a crisis (a key task of central banks).         The drive toward more&#13;
comprehensive supervision (as being negotiated now in Germany, for example)&#13;
represents the authorities' need to monitor banks' positions so that central&#13;
banks will be faced with no surprises.&#13;
Banks and Government Action&#13;
The previous subsection concludes that central banks can be expected&#13;
to act in the case of a banking crisis.     Prior to that possibility, however,&#13;
ways in which international institutions can act now to assist bank lending to&#13;
developing countries   are being   discussed.    Various guarantee schemes and&#13;
proposals have been made, but all seem to founder once the obstacle of "who is&#13;
guaranteeing  what"   is  reached.  26/    Banks'  and  governments'   roles  are&#13;
separate. Cofinancing and similar measures can contribute, but so far in only&#13;
a limited way.   The IMF, the World Bank, and banks should be able to remain&#13;
informal.    Each debt crisis,   each lending decision, has to be negotiated&#13;
individually. If the market is to operate as an efficient conduit of funds to&#13;
developing countries, the market's risks and imperfections have to be largely&#13;
accepted. Government action can ease the financing burden (see the subsection&#13;
"Flow of Banks' Funds to Developing Countries," above), but apart from greater&#13;
use of trade credit guarantees, bank lending will largely remain at the banks'&#13;
own risk.&#13;

Summary and Conclusions&#13;
This paper has attempted an overview of the present relationship&#13;
between private banks and the developing countries.&#13;
With the limitations of covering such a wide field, five features&#13;
seem to stand out:&#13;
*   There  is   a  real  possibility   that  the  developing&#13;
countries will find the availability of finance from&#13;
banks slowing in the 1980s, although the growth in bank&#13;
lending should be sufficient to cover needs.&#13;
*   While the Euromarket should continue to expand during&#13;
the 1980s in real terms, the price of credit to&#13;
developing countries may rise.&#13;
*   Banks face structural change that may restrict lending&#13;
to developing countries.&#13;
*   There are a few countries in difficult debt-servicing&#13;
positions; the outcome for these could determine the&#13;
pattern of future debt-rescheduling exercises.&#13;
*   Wider market participation,    especially by Arab-owned&#13;
banks, will be an important factor in ensuring a&#13;
reasonable flow of funds to developing countries.&#13;
The paper concludes, that, despite the current pessimism over the&#13;
developing country financing/recycling debate, the ability of the marketplace&#13;
to meet the requirements is considerable.&#13;

Appendix: Notes on Absorption of OPEC Deposits&#13;
and on Maturity Transformation.&#13;
In the same way that banks encounter balance-sheet constraints in&#13;
putting on new assets or loans, there are similar constraints in taking on new&#13;
deposits, particularly in large sums placed by OPEC investors.&#13;
Absorption of OPEC Deposits&#13;
Recently there has been a noticeable widening of the spread between&#13;
deposit and lending rates, insofar as deposit rates become less competitive.&#13;
Although this is not an across-the-board phenomenon, particularly large&#13;
deposits are unlikely to be offered at rates as competitive as in the past.&#13;
To date, therefore, the banks deposit-pricing mechanism is&#13;
adjusting to meet the high level of deposits that OPEC and other depositors&#13;
wish to place.   Of course, OPEC assets are being deployed not just to banks&#13;
but in other assets (e.g., equities).&#13;
Absorption of the rise in deposits from OPEC is also helped as the&#13;
rise is partly offset by slower growth in deposits from other countries (see&#13;
Table 23).  In 1979-80, whereas OPEC gross deposits jumped rapidly (up by $37&#13;
billion in 1979 and $41.5 billion in 1980, compared with $3.5 billion in&#13;
1978), deposits from non-OPEC developing countries rose by only $5.5 billion&#13;
in 1980, less than one-half the rise in 1978 and 1979.    All other depositors&#13;
(as regions) shared a slower growth in deposits, with the result that,&#13;
although the percentage growth in deposits reached 46 percent in 1979 and 35&#13;
percent in 1980 for OPEC, the market's deposit growth as a whole grew by some&#13;
15 percent a year less (30 percent in 1979, 20 percent in 1980).&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

The limiting factor then becomes how far banks wish OPEC to account&#13;
for a higher portion of total liabilities.      Since 1973 OPEC's share of the&#13;
market-s deposit positions has more than doubled (netting out interban,k&#13;
positions), from 19 percent at end 1973 to 46 percent at end 1980. Meanwhile,&#13;
on the BIS "Source and Uses" basis, OPEC countries' contribution to "sources"&#13;
remains around 18 percent (although this is for European-reporting banks&#13;
only).&#13;
Maturity Transformation&#13;
A bank's role as a financial intermediary leads it both to take on&#13;
credit risk and to carry out a certa.in degree of maturity transformation. In&#13;
the context of developing country lending, the advisability of taking on OPEC&#13;
short-term deposits and lending long to developing countries has often been&#13;
questioned with respect to the maturity mismatching (although there is no&#13;
interest exposure for the bank because of the rollover technique).&#13;
The Euromarket generally tends to be more mismatched in maturities&#13;
than domestic banking markets.     With respect to the future availability of&#13;
funds for developing countries, the importance of this factor depends upon the&#13;
effect of the mismatching on the question of capital adequacy and the&#13;
influence of possible loan losses from developing countries on the banks'&#13;
overall creditworthiness.&#13;
The capital adequacy issue is affected insofar as the more&#13;
mismatched a bank is, the higher the level of capital that would be required&#13;
to offer depositors protection.      With regard to the credit of the banks&#13;
themselves, if there is concern over the quality of the long-term assets (in&#13;
this case, developing country loans), then this clearly could lead to a&#13;
withdrawal of deposits from the bank, thus bringing the potential mismatching&#13;
problem into effect.&#13;
In essence, if we assume that there is no major problem over the&#13;
quality of loans to developing countries, then the mismatching problem will&#13;
not seriously damage the flow of funds to these countries.    However, if there&#13;
is a major crisis threatening the quality of assets with developing countries,&#13;
then because of the mismatching the effect on the market could be rapid.&#13;
Since many Eurobanks depend upon the interbank market for deposits rather than&#13;
upon regular depositors, withdrawal of funds could occur quite quickly. Given&#13;
the short maturity of these interbank funds, the problem of a run on the bank&#13;
would be reached much more quickly than in domesic markets.      As experienced&#13;
after the 1974 Herstatt crisis, a tiering of rates would be likely within the&#13;
Euromarket for different banks.      Undoubtedly central banks would act,     if&#13;
necessary,  to stabilize the market and supply liquidity.        But apart from&#13;
stabilization measures, it is unclear what action central banks could take if&#13;
there were a long-term problem over the quality of loans with developing&#13;
countries.   Thus,  it is important that the quality of developing country&#13;
assets is maintained through adequate bank balance-sheet arrangements.&#13;

            This paper seeks to stress the multiple
            nature of the private bank/developing country relationship.
            It examines recent events in lending to developing
            countries, with statistical coverage of the flows, some of
            the complex relationships involved, profitability, and the
            various constraints on private bank lending, including
            questions of capital adequacy, risk perception, and official
            regulation of private bank activities. It also takes a brief
            look at the future, commenting upon the role of new private
            banks (e.g., Arab banks), and provides indicative flows of
            funds for developing countries to 1985. The paper concludes
            that the private banking community will continue to provide
            large amounts of finance to developing countries. Where
            problems arise, these will best be solved on a case-by-case
            basis by the lending banks and the borrowing countries.
