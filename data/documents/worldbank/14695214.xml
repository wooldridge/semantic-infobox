I. Introduction&#13;
According to the 2010 Joint Monitoring Program (JMP)                                     including cultural factors, the post-genocide reconstruction&#13;

increased faster in rural Rwanda than in any other country                               tives. The evolution of the sector can be described through&#13;
in Sub-Saharan Africa. Almost four million people gained                                 four basic phases of development:&#13;
access to improved sanitation between 1990 and 2008.                                         â&#128;¢	 Historical Context: Traditional and cultural&#13;
54% of the population currently has access to improved                                           factors. Many traditional and cultural aspects have&#13;
sanitation, up from a baseline of 23% in 1990.1 Most of this                                     helped more recent improvements in sanitation.&#13;
progress has been with households upgrading â&#128;&#152;unimprovedâ&#128;&#153;                                         Open defecation, estimated at just 8% in 1992,&#13;

have been in rural areas, improvements in urban sanitation                                       regulations. Furthermore, a common language and&#13;
are notable as coverage has increased despite tremendous                                         several traditional customs helped drive progress in&#13;
growth in the urban population.                                                                  more recent years.&#13;

Understanding this progress requires understanding                                               ciliation. Almost 1.5 million people gained access&#13;

Rwanda is a small landlocked country of over 10 million people. With almost                             With almost 400 people per&#13;
400 people per square kilometer, Rwanda is one of the most densely populated&#13;
countries in the world, comparing with countries such as India.2 The country has&#13;
                                                                                                        square kilometer, Rwanda&#13;

Coffee and tea are the major cash crops for export, accounting for almost 40% of&#13;
total exports in 2009, though tourism is becoming a significant engine of growth                        populated countries in the&#13;
within the economy.                                                                                     world&#13;
Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s current economic challenges are the outcome of several factors in the&#13;
past. The economic structure reflects a failure to increase productivity despite a&#13;
growing work force. Poor governance and a variety of external factors played an&#13;
important role in the economic stagnation in this period. Although agricultural&#13;
production per capita and crop yields had been in steady decline since the mid-&#13;
1980s, high coffee prices masked failures of poor economic policy. Severe struc-&#13;
tural problems soon became very evident when international coffee prices fell. Per&#13;
capita income fell sharply from $380 in 1988 to $250 in 1993.3&#13;

    precarious condition of the country through reconstruction and reconciliation,&#13;

    es, the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s priority in the aftermath of the war was to tackle poverty&#13;
    by putting in place national policies and building the institutional frameworks                             latrines in new housing, had&#13;

    in this period helped lay important groundwork for the later years.&#13;

    The reconstruction process, which included the construction of improved latrines&#13;
    in new housing, had a very significant impact on sanitation coverage, with almost&#13;
                                                                                                                and 2000&#13;
    1.5 million people gaining access between 1995 and 2000. Villagization, or&#13;
    umudugudu, was a cornerstone of the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to deliver basic services&#13;
    for the thousands of returning families and to confront the demands of land&#13;
    scarcity. The approach dated back to the Arusha Protocol of 1993 under which&#13;
    refugees away for more than ten years would not claim their original property but&#13;
    be assisted to settle in villages by the government. The government saw umudu-&#13;
    gudu as a way to provide security for scattered families and improve services&#13;
    including schools, health centers, water, and roads at a lower cost. Developing&#13;
    detailed plans with specific technical requirements helped attract donor fund-&#13;
    ing. Supported by relief agencies, an estimated 300,000 houses, most of which&#13;
    included latrines, were constructed under the program by 2004.8&#13;
&#13;
    Even with these efforts, many poor people still lived in temporary shelter without&#13;
    adequate sanitation. In order to support these families, the government initiated&#13;
    a community action program based on a traditional practice of â&#128;&#152;Ubudeheâ&#128;&#153;. The&#13;
    program was used to involve communities in participatory planning and funding&#13;
    of priority projects across the country. The program encouraged communities&#13;
    to work together to help poorer families construct permanent housing that met&#13;
    basic sanitary standards.&#13;
&#13;
    Land reform&#13;
    Given the complexity of reintegrating returning refugees with the number&#13;
    of families that died in 1994, ownership of housing and land was a pressing&#13;
    issue for the government to tackle. Historically, land belonged to the state and&#13;

                                 the Strategy&#13;
    By the early 2000â&#128;&#153;s, the government was able to consolidate its vision and started   Decentralization was a key&#13;
    shifting its focus from short-term measures to recover from the war and geno-&#13;
    cide to long-term development plans and strategies. These included critical poli-    reform of this period, laying&#13;
    cies and strategies for the sanitation sector. Sanitation and hygiene emerged as     down a basic institutional&#13;
    important interventions as stakeholders saw more evidence showing the need to&#13;
    shift from curative to preventative policies. Decentralization was a key reform of   framework to improve&#13;
    this period, laying down a basic institutional framework to improve sanitation       sanitation coverage&#13;
    coverage. Participatory Hygiene and Sanitation Transformation (PHAST) and&#13;
    Hygiene et Assainissement en Milieu Scolaire (HAMS) programs were initiated&#13;
    to promote hygiene and sanitation by influencing positive behavioral change and&#13;
    adoption of better practices among Rwandan communities, they also introduced&#13;
    concepts that later evolved and were mainstreamed under the national commu-&#13;
    nity health promotion program.&#13;
&#13;
    Placing sanitation at the center of poverty reduction&#13;
    strategies&#13;
    While the rural water supply sector started being actively managed by the govern-&#13;
    ment in the sixties and an urban utility was created in 1976, the first National&#13;
    Sectoral Policy was only developed in 1992. It was subsequently revised four&#13;
    times to include emerging issues including: demand responsive approaches&#13;
    (1997); decentralization and reinforced participation (2004); and hygiene, sani-&#13;
    tation, and environment (2010). Until 2010, the policies covered sanitation but,&#13;
    in practice, mainly targeted water supply. Financing within the sector also showed&#13;
    a very strong bias towards water. Donor projects always had a sanitation compo-&#13;
    nent but this was often ignored in implementation. Health systems were mainly&#13;
    focused on curative approaches to improvements in health. This started shifting as&#13;
    stakeholders started advocating the need to focus more on preventative measures.&#13;
    In response, the government started investing in effective low-cost promotional&#13;
    strategies to encourage household investments in improved sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
    In 2002, the government introduced its Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper&#13;
    (PRSP), developed through an extensive national consultation process, to guide&#13;
    national planning efforts to achieve the targets outlined for Vision 2020. The&#13;
    PRSP recognized that access to water and sanitation was essential to the overall&#13;
    strategy and vision of improving lives and reducing poverty by:&#13;
        â&#128;¢	 Improving maternal and childrenâ&#128;&#153;s health;&#13;
        â&#128;¢	 Improving enrolment in schools, especially for girls;&#13;
        â&#128;¢	 Improving security, particularly for women;&#13;
        â&#128;¢	 Reducing health expenses for households and the Government, particu-&#13;
           larly for diseases like diarrhea; and&#13;
        â&#128;¢	 Increasing productivity because of better health.&#13;

responsibility for different sectors between the different                       cide, a period of poor governance characterized by highly&#13;
ministries, districts and other stakeholders. While the first                    centralized authority and lack of citizen participation in&#13;
PRSP focused on managing a transitional period of reha-                          leadership and development. Following the policy, the&#13;

In parallel to the PRSP, the government started drafting                         planned and implemented at the district level.&#13;

          urban and rural sanitation are heavily dependent on household contributions, which require significant effort&#13;
          from Government in terms of promoting and marketing access to sanitation. This is primarily being done&#13;
          through the Government-Based Environmental Health Promotion Program (cBEHPP) which has adopted a&#13;
          community hygiene club approach supported by 45,000 community health workers. A cBEHPP road map was&#13;
          launched in December 2009, and Government is encouraging â&#128;&#152;partnersâ&#128;&#153; to support the program. There are no&#13;
          subsidies for communities, who must try to graduate from a course which covers 20 topics including hygiene&#13;
          and sanitation. Training for members of the community hygiene club includes methods of constructing a tippy&#13;
          tap or building a lid for latrines. The facilitator signs off once they have completed all the topics and there will&#13;
          be a formal graduation ceremony for the village.&#13;
&#13;
          Progress under CbeHPP is measured through â&#128;&#152;7 Golden Indicatorsâ&#128;&#153;:&#13;
          1. increased use of hygienic latrines in schools and homes from 28% to 80%&#13;
          2. increased hand-washing with soap at critical times from 34% to 80%&#13;
          3. improved safe drinking water access and handling in schools and homes to 80%&#13;
          4. Establishment of cHcs in every village from 0% to 100%&#13;
          5. Achieve Zero Open Defecation (ZOD) in all villages to 100%&#13;
          6. Safe disposal of childrenâ&#128;&#153;s feces in every household 28-100%;&#13;
          7. Households with bath shelters, rubbish pits, pot-drying racks and clean yards to increase to 80%&#13;

     the process of translating these national targets and policies                      budgetary allocation for the achievement of each target.&#13;

     Adapting Imihigo, a tradition that Rwanda has institution-                          by a task force comprising the Prime Ministerâ&#128;&#153;s Office,&#13;
     alized as a means to enhance local government reform and                            MINALOC and the Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s Office. Each district pres-&#13;

     Imihigo draws on a cultural practice of publicly commit-&#13;
     ting to achieving specific goals. Failing to meet these                             Responding to other weaknesses in the decentraliza-&#13;
     commitments was considered to be a dishonor for the indi-                           tion process, the government developed the Rwanda&#13;
     viduals and the community. Following the reforms in the                             Decentralization Strategic Framework (RDSF) in 2007 to&#13;
     early 2000â&#128;&#153;s, Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s Ministry for Local Administration                            guide the ongoing implementation of the decentralization&#13;

   The cSO scorecard for Rwanda shows that policy tools are largely in place, but the scores for planning and&#13;

   Sustaining gains by strengthening sanitation markets will need to be a focus going forward.&#13;

     From the ruins of years of war and genocide, Rwanda has          ownership and accountability, for example, made it easier&#13;
     moved to improve household access to hygienic sanitation         for the government to implement national sanitation strat-&#13;
     facilities faster than in any other country in Sub-Saharan       egies into decentralized networks that reached right down&#13;
     Africa. Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s experience shows that progress is possible      to the smallest administrative unit in each village. Similarly,&#13;
     even in these difficult circumstances. Three key elements        the Ubudehe program, based on the tradition of mutual&#13;

        <abstracts>
            According to the 2010 Joint Monitoring
            Program (JMP) update household access to sanitation
            facilities has increased faster in rural Rwanda than in any
            other country in Sub-Saharan Africa. Almost four million
            people gained access to improved sanitation between 1990 and
            2008. 54 percent of the population currently has access to
            improved sanitation, up from a baseline of 23 percent in
            1990. Most of this progress has been with households
            upgrading 'unimproved' latrines to improved
            hygienic ones. While the greatest gains have been in rural
            areas, improvements in urban sanitation are notable as
            coverage has increased despite tremendous growth in the
            urban population. The analysis in the report is structured
            around these four phases of development, and seeks to
            identify factors, including the enabling policies,
            institutions, sector initiatives, and cultural aspects that
            help explain how Rwanda has made progress towards the
            sanitation Millennium Development Goal (MDG). While it is
            clear that the specific context that characterizes Rwanda is
            unique, the report will share some conclusions from
            Rwanda's experience for other countries to consider.
