Abstract&#13;
This paper analyze; the institutional factors in the remarkable&#13;
success of the Kenya Tea Development Authority, and draws some lessons&#13;
which may be useful to other development institutions. It surveys the&#13;
rapid growth of KTDA, which .Ls now the largest and most successful&#13;
smallholder tea scheme in the world, with 138,000 growers, 24 operating&#13;
factories, and production of around 33,000 metric tons of manufactured&#13;
tea, most of it of premium quality. The paper identifies organizational&#13;
autonomy, strategic managerial control and an effective accountability&#13;
and incentive system as the lceys to KTDA's institutional success.&#13;
Current problems arising from market conditions and the maturing of the&#13;
smallholder tea industry are discussed in terms of the institutional&#13;
adaptations they will require the Authority to make. Finally, the paper&#13;
considers the relevance of KTDA's experience for other development&#13;
institutions.&#13;

This study would not have been possible without the generous&#13;
cooperation of KTDA, and partLcularly of Messrs. George Gitungo (Chief&#13;
Technical Officer) and Maina Kariuki (Public Relations Officer), who&#13;
arranged an extensive program of field visits and interviews for us in&#13;
1981. We are grateful for their help. We would also like to thank the&#13;
Chairman and the General Manager of KTDA, Messrs. Charles K. Koinange and&#13;
Simon Kamuyu, and through them to express our gratitude to the many tea&#13;
growers, extension staff, factory managers and regional and headquarters&#13;
personnel who took time and trouble to answer our questions. We are also&#13;
grateful to Messrs. W.D. Ware-Austin and R. Kemoli of the Commonwealth&#13;
Development Corporation for their assistance.&#13;
A large number of Bank staff gave helpful and often detailed&#13;
comments on an earlier draft. We were especially fortunate to be able to&#13;
draw on the long experience wLth KTDA of two Bank staff members:&#13;
Christopher Walton, who was cLosely involved in the establishment of KTDA&#13;
and its predecessor organizatLon, and Alistair Wilson of the Bank's&#13;
Regional Mission in Nairobi. Gail McDonnell assisted with the compilation&#13;
of the financial appendix. None of the above is responsible for any&#13;

Section I: INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY&#13;
1.        This study sets out to provide a coherent account of the Kenya&#13;
Tea Development Authority as an example of successful institutional&#13;
development, and to draw some lessons from KTDA's experience which may be&#13;
applied to organizational, managerial and other institutional aspects of&#13;
projects in developing countries. The study is part of a continuing&#13;
program of work in the difficult area of institutional development, in&#13;
which the World Bank seeks to learn from and contribute to efforts by its&#13;
member countries to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of development&#13;
institutions.&#13;
2.         The Kenya Tea Development Authority is widely acknowledged to be&#13;
a remarkably successful institution in two fields--smallholder rural&#13;
development and public sector enterprise--in which the African experience&#13;
has often been fraught with difficulties and disappointing performance. In&#13;
roughly two decades it has orpanized the planting of about 54,000 hectares&#13;
of tea by some 138,000 smallholders, and has become a major processor and&#13;
the largest exporter of black tea in the world. Smallholders produced&#13;
146,000 metric tons of greenleaf in the crop year 1980/81, which was&#13;
processed into approximately :13,000 metric tons of made tea, 85% of it for&#13;
export. Smallholder tea exports, virtually non-existent before 1960, have&#13;
accounted for about one-third of Kenya annual tea exports since the&#13;
mid-1970s, the remainder coming from long-established commercially-&#13;
owned tea estates. The rapid expansion of smallholder production has been&#13;
the major factor consolidating tea as Kenya's second most important export&#13;
commodity, and third largest source of foreign exchange earnings (after&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
tourism and coffee, but excluding re-export of refined petroleum&#13;
products). Although no comprehensive evidence on grower incomes is&#13;
available, it seems clear that grower incomes from tea grew very rapidly&#13;
over the 1960s and 1970s to a level comfortably above the Kenyan average.&#13;
KTDA's record is reviewed in Section II.&#13;
3.        This study concentrates on the institutional factors in that&#13;
success. Natural conditions (climate, rainfall, elevation, soils) and the&#13;
economic environment were very favourable to smallholder tea in Kenya for&#13;
much of the 1960's and 1970's, but they required appropriate institutional&#13;
mechanisms on both the supply and demand sides to fashion an efficient and&#13;
sustainable smallholder production system for this demanding crop. Those&#13;
mechanisms, and their applicability (or indeed their limitations) beyond&#13;
their immediate Kenyan setting are the subject of this paper.&#13;
4.        Rural development presents peculiar difficulties for building and&#13;
sustaining effective development institutions, particularly where small&#13;
farmers are concerned. Each peasant holding is a complex producing and&#13;
consuming unit whose members' behaviour is subject to a wide range of&#13;
internal and external conditions--social, cultural and political as well as&#13;
economic. Institutions which are both stable and innovative enough to cope&#13;
with this complexity must deal with an array of activities which are&#13;
overwhelmingly social rather than technical.&#13;
5.        Rural development involves large numbers of people, pursuing&#13;
multiple and often imprecise objectives, and operating in a highly variable&#13;
environment. Management styles and organizational frameworks appropriate&#13;
to factories or urban bureaucracies cannot easily be applied in such&#13;
uncontr6lled. environments; nor are there often readily identifiable paths&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
along which institutional resources may be concentrated to attain output or&#13;
welfare objectives.&#13;
6.        KTDA's approach to these difficulties has been to concentrate&#13;
institutional resources on activities which were crucial to the whole cycle&#13;
of tea production--and which had a technical character making them&#13;
susceptible to efficient intervention by the Authority.&#13;
7.         Compared to the complexities of an integrated rural development&#13;
project, KTDA has had a simpler task in this respect: the technical&#13;
package which it administers in field and factory is simpler and has been&#13;
tested in estate production, and the managerial and financial coordination&#13;
involved is more straightforward.    Moreover, the smallholder tea industry&#13;
soon began to generate a cash flow which, in the 1960s and 1970s, was&#13;
greater and more stable than in most peasant agricultural activities.&#13;
8.        Nevertheless, the Authority, like most rural development&#13;
institutions, was dealing with a large clientele of potential peasant&#13;
growers, as well as its own personnel. Although responsible only for a&#13;
single crop, it was involved in comprehensive or integrated provision of&#13;
most components of the productive system. Credit, extension, nurseries,&#13;
transport, processing and marketing all fell within its sphere.&#13;
9.         The Authority's answer--partly by design, partly as a creative&#13;
response to changing circumstances--has been to identify particular&#13;
activities which; at different phases in the sequence of smallholder tea&#13;
development over 20 years, have provided KTDA with the most effective&#13;
leverage. In the early stages, the key element was planting material--KTDA&#13;
owned the tree stump nurseries; and therefore could exercise "quality&#13;
control" of growers through licensing and issuing planting material. As&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
more and more smallholder tea approached pluckable age, and as planting&#13;
technology changed, the emphasis moved to control over processing. Quality&#13;
control was then concentrated at the factory end since the factories' power&#13;
to buy or refuse leaf provided an effective incentive to field staff and&#13;
growers.&#13;
10.       For this control of strategic resources to be effective, however,&#13;
staff and farmer incentives had to be pushing in the same direction, and&#13;
both management and line personnel had to be accountable for results. The&#13;
Authority's structure and operating methods are designed to accomplish&#13;
this. Grower returns are directly related to world prices realized for&#13;
specific factories' output; but the payment system has both regular&#13;
(monthly) and bonus (annual) elements. This mix of financial security and&#13;
incentives has worked well. Field staff are closely supervised by KTDA&#13;
superiors, and their performance is also subject to influence from growers&#13;
through representation on district tea committees and on KTDA's board.&#13;
Field staff and growers alike are answerable to the factories for&#13;
delivering high-quality leaf--and factory managements are quickly held&#13;
accountable for the quality (and hence the price) of the resulting made&#13;
tea.&#13;
11.       KTDA's successful control, incentive and accountability system,&#13;
analyzed in detail in Section III, would have been ineffective unless&#13;
certin external conditions had been met. The Authority has been permitted&#13;
substantial autonomy to carry out its development task. It is held to&#13;
account by its owner, the Kenya Government, and in important respects by&#13;
the external agencies which have supplied development capital. But it&#13;
controls the resources necessary to do its job, it is not subjected to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5-&#13;
substantial operational interference, and it does not have tax, subsidy or&#13;
other burdens placed on it which could cripple its financial and&#13;
operational performance. That external autonomy is complemented by the&#13;
basic external incentive of wDrld market prices: KTDA's policy has been to&#13;
avoid insulating either itself or its growers from market influences. This&#13;
sustained external economic pressure is used--at some risk--to demonstrate&#13;
the direct link between premium tea production and high grower returns, and&#13;
to enhance the competitive leanness of KTDA itself.&#13;
12.       This study also emphasizes, however, that even the most effective&#13;
development institution is likely to encounter two major kinds of&#13;
challenge. Firstly, the external environment changes--sometimes&#13;
radically. In KTDA's case, t'he Authority is now facing difficulties from&#13;
drought, from declining world tea pricesl/ and from income alternatives&#13;
competing for farmer attention, all of which tend to exert downward&#13;
pressure on production and hence on KTDA's viability. Secondly,&#13;
institutions themselves have a life-cycle. KTDA has had an outstanding&#13;
record in the initial establishment of itself and of the smallholder tea&#13;
industry, and in the second phase of rapid expansion and diversification&#13;
into processing and marketing. The third phase of consolidating the&#13;
earlier gains and assuring continued efficiency and high returns when&#13;
expansion is much slower and the external environment more uncertain,&#13;
however, poses different demands--and there are signs that the Authority is&#13;
experiencing some difficulty Ln dealing with them. These issues are&#13;
discussed in Section IV.&#13;
1/ World tea prices have falLen substantially since the "beverage boom"&#13;
year 1977. World Bank prLce forecasts for tea indicate a continued&#13;
fall in real terms in comLng years, with average tea prices declining&#13;
by 1985 to a real 15% below their 1981 level.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
13.        What lessons does KTDA provide for institutional development in&#13;
other settings? Although the focus of this paper is on KTDA itself rather&#13;
than on systematic comparison with other development institutions, some&#13;
broader conclusions are drawn in Section V. While KTDA should not be&#13;
regarded as a readily transferable "model," certain features can be&#13;
identified as particularly important from a managerial and institutional&#13;
point of view. These may be summarized as follows: 1) consciously&#13;
designed and effectively sustained organizational autonomy; 2) control of&#13;
resources and activities crucial to performance; 3) effective and&#13;
involuntary accountability; 4) effective and mutually reinforcing&#13;
incentives for different sets of participants in tea production. The&#13;
combination of these factors has been so successful, in KTDA's case, in&#13;
large part because of the strong role of external elements--growers,&#13;
lenders and prices--in maintaining the Authority's internal discipline.&#13;
There is no guarantee that KTDA or any other institution can successfully&#13;
withstand adverse economic and other pressures. It is clear, however, that&#13;
the Authority has acquired unusual reserves of institutional strength to&#13;
deal with its difficulties, so long as basic ground rules of autonomy,&#13;
control and accountability to its stakeholders remain in force.&#13;
&#13;

Section II: SMALLHOLDER TEA DEVELOPMENT:&#13;
KTDA's RECORD&#13;
14.       Kenya has the most successful major peasant-based tea scheme in&#13;
the world, which has grown over two decades to encompass a significant&#13;
proportion of the rural population. Ninety percent of Kenya's people are&#13;
rural, and most of them are members of smallholder households. There are&#13;
about 1.5 million smallholdings, 60% of them operated for subsistence,&#13;
without significant cash crop production. KTDA's 138,000 tea growers&#13;
therefore account for about 9% of all smallholdings which produce a&#13;
substantial proportion of their output for the market. KTDA's successful&#13;
mobilization of the productive potential of these farmers is the more&#13;
noteworthy because it was effected by a parastatal agricultural monopoly in&#13;
a country where other agricultural parastatals have often suffered from&#13;
severe financial, managerial and organizational problems, and have&#13;
certainly not had a performance record comparable to KTDA's.&#13;
Organizational Design and StaffiLng&#13;
15.       The concept of a Kenyan smallholder tea operation began to take&#13;
shape during the early 1950s, encouraged by the British Colonial&#13;
Development Corporation (now the Commonwealth Development Corporation). By&#13;
1960, the Special Crops Development Authority (SCDA) was established to&#13;
promote production of African-grown teas, as well as other crops with which&#13;
it might later wish to become involved.    In January, 1964, just one month&#13;
after Kenya achieved independence, the SCDA was transformed into the Kenyan&#13;
Tea Development Authority (KTDA), and its mandate restricted to tea. By&#13;
1979/80, KTDA operations covered two large regions, West and East of the&#13;
Rift Valley (see map).&#13;

16.       From the outset, the organizational design was spelled out in&#13;
some detail. A Working Party advising on the establishment of the&#13;
SCDA2/ recommended that SCDA would: a) essentially be a commercial&#13;
enterprise, b) finance its capital investment by borrowing from sources&#13;
other than Government (e.g., CDC, the World Bank, etc.), c) acquire&#13;
specified responsibilities from the Ministry of Agriculture, related to&#13;
SCDA's commercial operations, and d) require special commercial direction,&#13;
which the government could not provide. The Authority would take charge of&#13;
planting programs, field operations, inspection and collection, purchase,&#13;
transportation, and the sale of greenleaf to factories, and would control&#13;
distribution of tea plants for smallholders and registration of those&#13;
farmers who would be allowed to grow tea. The Ministry of Agriculture&#13;
agreed to second the staff for field extension full time; the Working Party&#13;
had suggested that these staff specialize in tea only. Outside SCDA, the&#13;
government initially retained nominal ownership over nurseries, and it was&#13;
expected that tea factories would be financed and in part owned by private&#13;
sector companies. The nurseries were regarded as crucial to operational&#13;
control from the outset, however, and the consolidation of district&#13;
nurseries into two large nurseries East and West of Rift under KTDA's&#13;
direct control merely put the seal on what had already been the case.&#13;
17.       The major change with the establishment of KTDA was that the new&#13;
Authority would deal exclusively with tea. Otherwise, the experience of&#13;
the SCDA during the first planting period from 1960-1964 had already set in&#13;
motion several reforms, based on the perceived needs to consolidate control&#13;

and sharpen farmer incentives. For example, rather than giving growers a&#13;
flat payment (and possible bonus) for greenleaf collected, the Authority&#13;
made a fixed first payment based on the weight of greenleaf (per kg)&#13;
collected, and a second variable payment annually based on the price&#13;
achieved by the "made" (manufactured) tea on the world market. A&#13;
Development Charge was levied on growers as a down payment for tea stumps,&#13;
and credit was carefully controlled in order to strengthen the Authority's&#13;
power to regulate the selection of growers and the acreage which farmers&#13;
could plant tea. By the end of the 1960s, KTDA had started to take over&#13;
existing tea factories and to build new ones, thus fully integrating all&#13;
aspects of tea operations within its organization.&#13;
18.        It is thus apparent that the concept of control has been very&#13;
important in the Authority's organizational design, stemming from the&#13;
difficulties generally experienced in managing agriculture and rural&#13;
development, combined with the initial political uncertainties. In&#13;
creating the SCDA, the Working Party had reasoned that a high degree of&#13;
control by the Authority of the smallholder areas was necessary to secure&#13;
high tea prices, low production and processing costs, and the economic and&#13;
financial viability of the smallholder tea project. Jeffrey Steeves has&#13;
noted: "It was felt that the nature of the crop and the need for&#13;
efficiency warranted this emphasis (on control). One is dealing, then,&#13;
with an organizational structure designed to assure control.",3/ One&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
author goes so far as to describe KTDA as "an all powerful autocratic&#13;
organization.. .both monopolist and monopsonist."4/&#13;
19.        Internally, the Authority has achieved a record of fairly tight&#13;
management and supervision, due not so much to its nominal comprehensive&#13;
control but to the way it used strategic control to maximize operational&#13;
efficiency. First, the ratios of field staff to farmers were carefully&#13;
apportioned, so that task loads were manageable (see Organizational Chart,&#13;
Figure 1). Because growers were registered, the Authority had accurate&#13;
information about the numbers of. farmers to receive extension service and&#13;
therefore what staff and overhead resources would be needed in support.&#13;
Second, since operations were limited to tea, the tasks and farmer contacts&#13;
for each type of staff coulcl be set out explicitly. This contrasted with&#13;
dilution of efforts in extension programs elsewhere, from overburdening of&#13;
field staff with multiple roles, and lack of detailed work programs,&#13;
schedules or clientele. Third, the vertical integration of services for a&#13;
single crop has meant that weaknesses in crop performance could be traced&#13;
back to failures of specific services (and individuals). Fourth, the&#13;
diaries kept (in duplicate) by extension agents and farmers have provided&#13;
supervisors with easy access; to information on the frequency of visits and&#13;
nature of assistance rendered, without burdening staff with laborious&#13;
report writing. Immediate supervisors sign the diaries they check,&#13;
indicating in turn to their own supervisors that they have carried out&#13;
their duties. Fifth, the Authority located extension staff strategically&#13;
and made them sufficiently maobile so as to cover the territory and staff&#13;

20.       The Authority consists of four separate branches:   tea committees&#13;
representing farmers, extension,5/ leaf inspection and collection, and&#13;
factory operations (see Figure 1). Presiding over the four branches is the&#13;
KTDA Board, which includes members from KTDA, the Kenyan Government, grower&#13;
organizations and external financing sources.6/ Lower level field&#13;
extension has grown considerably from the level originally forecast (see&#13;
Table 1). The total extension staff was expected to peak at 166 and then&#13;
taper off in the 1970's; actually, it reached 722 by 1971/72, and 762 in&#13;
1981. This growth reflected an expansion of tea land, and of the&#13;
Authority's diversification into manufacturing and marketing in contrast to&#13;
previous plans. In fact, the 657% expansion of staff proceeded more or&#13;
less pari passu with tea land increases.&#13;
21.       The Commonwealth Development Corporation provided initial&#13;
assistance in recruiting staff, drawing on a wide range of people who had&#13;
acquired considerable experience with tea both in Kenya and elsewhere. By&#13;
1968, however, all but two of KTDA's staff were predominantly Kenyans, and&#13;
most were Africans. Given that quality and performance standards were&#13;
maintained, this was a considerable achievement in rapid localization of&#13;

Agriculture, they work full time with the Authority, receive its extra&#13;
job benefits, and speciaLize in tea. In other words, they function&#13;

personnel. As for selection of personnel, the KTDA Board appoints the&#13;
General Manager, and otherwise the Authority has control of staff hiring&#13;
and firing, including control over the extension staff seconded by the&#13;
Ministry of Agriculture. KTDA has been a prestigious place to work, and&#13;
therefore has had a fairly good choice of staff candidates. It has favored&#13;
young, technically qualified and ambitious candidates, especially for&#13;
factory managers and middle management positions, and has thus placed&#13;
rather less emphasis on seniority than is often the case. Besides a&#13;
moderate amount of staff training and job mobility, KTDA provides a strong&#13;
system of staff incentives, as detailed in Section III of this paper.&#13;
Financing&#13;
22.       The original and largest single source of capital investment in&#13;
KTDA's development has been the Commonwealth Development Corporation. CDC&#13;
had lent approximately L16m. stg. to the Authority by 1981, and continues&#13;
to be involved in its factory construction programme. The World Bank&#13;
assisted KTDA in the intensive periods of field development with two IDA&#13;
credits ($2.3m for 1964-68 and $2.1m for 1968-72: not all of these credits&#13;
were drawn, however). A World Bank Loan of $10.4m for construction of 17&#13;
tea factories and associated services was extended in 1974 and disbursed&#13;
1974-81. Other external financing has been provided by the West German&#13;
government, the European Investment Bank and by OPEC, which is currently&#13;
financing construction of three factories. The Kenya Government and&#13;
parastatal financial corporations have also provided substantial loan&#13;
capital to KTDA. Government and its agencies have accounted for slightly&#13;
less than 20% of KTDA's KSh 538 million total loan financing to date.&#13;
Appendix Table 5 provides details.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
23.       KTDA was intended from the outset to be operationally&#13;
self-financing. Operating costs are met from a cess deducted from the&#13;
monthly "first payment" to farmers for their greenleaf (the payment system&#13;
is explained in more detail in Section III). The cess has for some years&#13;
been fixed at KSh. 0.31 per kg greenleaf, deducted from a first payment to&#13;
farmers of KSh 1.11 per kg. The cess has remained fixed despite changes in&#13;
the level of first payments over the last decade, from KSh. 0.88 (1970-77)&#13;
to KSh 1.00 (1977-81) and then KSh. 1.11 for the crop and financial year&#13;
1981-82. KTDA's operating income is therefore not directly dependent on&#13;
world tea prices, but on the quantity of greenleaf which farmers deliver.&#13;
(Of course prices have an indirect effect through farmer incentives, but&#13;
many other factors also affect the level of leaf deliveries). The Appendix&#13;
tables contain further detail on the Authority's finances.&#13;
Cultivation&#13;
24.       Originally, tea planting material was issued to growers in the&#13;
form of "stumps," i.e., plants cultivated in nurseries from seed. The&#13;
stumps took approximately four years before they could be plucked (and nine&#13;
years to reach their full productive capacity). Aggregate development&#13;
costs in the early phase were made available to KTDA by CDC, and repaid by&#13;
growers through the capital cess, while the Authority's recurrent costs&#13;
were covered by the recurrent cess. The two cesses were amalgamated in&#13;
1973, at some cost to early planters who might have expected to complete&#13;
repayment of the "capital" portion and hence to have their cess reduced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
25.        In the mid-1960's, KTDA began experimentation with vegetative&#13;
propagation (VP)7/ under the guidance of the East African Tea Research&#13;
Institute in Kericho, Kenya. By the 1968-69 season all plantings were VP&#13;
material, still issued by KTDA. VP possessed an advantage over stump tea&#13;
in that it was easier to obtain, less expensive, matured more quickly, and&#13;
its quality could be closely controlled by cloning from plants best adapted&#13;
to and most productive in a given area. By the end of the 1970's large&#13;
numbers of farmers had learned to do VP, sometimes even better then their&#13;
extension representatives, and were filling in or adding to their tea&#13;
holdings by independent cloning from their own mother bushes. The one&#13;
disadvantage which has emerged during the last two difficult drought years&#13;
is that the VP material which KTDA introduced appears less drought-&#13;
resistant than stump tea.&#13;
The Growers&#13;
26.        The Authority aimed at drawing smallholders into tea production&#13;
as an addition to, rather than a substitute for, their current subsistence&#13;
farming. The tea would be grown on land thus far under-utilized, but with&#13;
suitable altitude, soil, precipitation, etc. Because of its economic&#13;
attractiveness, and because Africans had for much of the colonial period&#13;
been effectively prohibited from cultivating tea and several other cash&#13;
crops, there was very strong smallholder interest in entering tea&#13;
production in the early sixties.&#13;
27.       Originally, the size of plots was limited so as to spread the&#13;
income benefits as broadly Eas possible. But by the time KTDA was&#13;
established, the CDC and World Bank were both pressing the Authority to&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
expand the average holding to a more economically viable size: one acre,&#13;
or approximately 0.4 ha., was considered desirable. It was argued that&#13;
farmers with holdings smaller than this would not find it worth their time&#13;
to harvest the tea and carry it to collection centers. In fact, the&#13;
average tea holding grew from 0.18 ha. in 1960-61 to 0.4 ha. in 1970-71&#13;
(where it has more or less remained). However, in the 1960's some farmers&#13;
circumvented restrictions on new admissions by planting tea illegally.&#13;
They obtained bushes by stealing (from commercial estates, KTDA nurseries,&#13;
or their neighbors), by persuading registered relatives or neighbors to buy&#13;
extra plants from KTDA for them or supply them with VP cuttings, or by&#13;
subdividing existing plots without informing the Authority. By the late&#13;
1960s, unlicensed planting was enough of a concern for KTDA to impose a&#13;
Development Charge on anyone growing tea, to declare an amnesty so that&#13;
illegal growers could be registered, and to require that farmer VP&#13;
nurseries be licensed.&#13;
28.        It has been argued (for example in Steeves, op. cit.) that the&#13;
Authority's minimum acreage restrictions and its concern to regulate new&#13;
entrants discriminated against poorer farmers, and that these were the&#13;
farmers who resorted to illegal planting with the acquiescence of junior&#13;
extension staff, with a consequent loss of an important degree of KTDA&#13;
control. The holding size issue is a complex and uncertain one: analysis&#13;
of the distributional effects of KTDA operations, for example, is hampered&#13;
by lack of good data on the socio-economic characteristics of tea growers&#13;
compared to the generality of households in tea areas. It is also true, as&#13;
we discuss in Section IV, that a rational holding-size norm established in&#13;
the 1960s may need revision in the new conditions of 1982. There is no&#13;
convincing evidence, however, that the restrictions led to very substantial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
illegal planting, nor to a consequent deterioration of husbandry standards&#13;
because illegal growers were not within the Authority's purview. On the&#13;
basis of KTDA's knowledge about current acreage yields, no significant&#13;
upward deviation can be detected from expected leaf production: in other&#13;
words, there do not appear to be large deliveries from illicit acreage.&#13;
Secondly, even if substantial unregistered holdings do exist, there is no&#13;
detectable evidence of poor quality leaf being insinuated into the KTDA&#13;
buying system--although there may be a small amount of illegal domestic&#13;
selling of sun-dried tea from unregistered sources.&#13;
29.       KTDA has encouraged farmers to participate in policy discussions&#13;
and implementation of decisions. The elected divisional and district tea&#13;
committees, the provincial tea boards, and farmer representation on the&#13;
KTDA Board itself have comprised the formal institutional channel for&#13;
advising the tea land allocation process, for transmitting KTDA policy&#13;
information, and for forwarding grievances. Originally the lower-level&#13;
bodies .were dominated by KTDA staff, and largely functioned to communicate&#13;
downwards what the Authority wished, but the growers have increasingly&#13;
taken the initiative. A second means for farmer participation has been&#13;
buying of shares in individual KTDA tea factories. Currently about 15,000&#13;
farmers, or approximately 1( percent of all KTDA farmers, are holders of&#13;
about 1.6 million shares in the 16 tea factories so far incorporated as&#13;
public companies. Dividends on these shares are limited to 8% until&#13;
factory loan obligations are repaid: apart from the monetary incentive of&#13;
shareholding, however, the (levice gives farmers an interest in KTDA&#13;
performance and some voice Ln operations. (It is however true that&#13;
shareholding tends to be concentrated among wealthier growers, with&#13;
possibly a corresponding increase in their already substantial influence in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
KTDA affairs.) Third, a less formal communications channel consists of&#13;
periodic visits to farmers by KTDA senior extension and headquarters staff,&#13;
to find out about grower progress first hand (rather than relying solely on&#13;
reports from the field staff). Senior staff make much of this commitment&#13;
to firsthand contact with growers, and it is clear that the growers are&#13;
vocal and independent in return.&#13;
Factory Operations&#13;
30.       Although KTDA originally comprised only an extension and leaf&#13;
production operation, it began taking over the previously privately run&#13;
factories in the late 1960s. KTDA now operates 27 factories and envisages&#13;
an eventual total of 39 factories, counting those now planned or under&#13;
construction (see factory locations as of 1980/81 on map, p. 6). During&#13;
KTDA's movement into the factory sector, it cooperated very closely with&#13;
the private tea companies, which contributed valuable assistance in the&#13;
establishment and initial management of KTDA factories, and in training&#13;
Authority staff.&#13;
31.        Significantly, KTDA factories operate on a semi-autonomous basis,&#13;
with their own financial accounting systems. One exception involves the&#13;
occasional decision by KTDA to borrow resources from healthier factories in&#13;
order to help out factories just starting up or experiencing unavoidable&#13;
difficulties. Factory managers exercise a fair degree of independence in&#13;
staffing, technical and other aspects of operations.&#13;
Indicators of Success&#13;
Expanzion&#13;
32.        Besides being the largest and most successful smallholder tea&#13;
scheme in the world, KTDA has been the main force sustaining the rapid&#13;
growth rate of Kenyan tea industry in recent years, to maintain tea as the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
second largest export crop (after coffee). The expansion of Kenya's tea&#13;
output is indicated below. Simallholder output has increased&#13;
enormously--from about 1,200 metric tons in 1965 to over 30,000 tons in&#13;
1979/80--as a result of rapidly expanding KTDA acreages. Estate production&#13;
has increased much more slowly, but from a much larger base and mainly by&#13;
marked improvements in productivity, since estate acreage has not grown&#13;
very much over the last decade. The estates produced 18,600 tons in 1965,&#13;
compared with about 62,000 tons in 1979/80. Smallholder tea has accounted&#13;
for roughly one-third of total annual marketed tea output by volume since&#13;
the mid-1970's, and somewhat more than one-third by value because KTDA tea&#13;
quality is higher than that of the estates.&#13;

33.        The commercial estates have produced somewhat lower quality tea&#13;
than KTDA because of the different economics of estate production. High&#13;
quality plucking becomes more difficult to organize and supervise as&#13;
holding size increases--even on peasant plots, KTDA maintains that leaf&#13;
quality tends to decline as holdings rise above 0.4 ha. and rely&#13;
increasingly on hired labor. Given family labor commitment and the fact&#13;
that KTDA growers have no other legal outlet to secure a return on their&#13;
tea investment (in contrast to estate laborers who may be able to secure&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

work elsewhere), the Authority has up till now been in a strong position to&#13;
insist on its premium tea policy.&#13;
34.        Smallholder tea land has expanded steadily under successive KTDA&#13;
planting plans:   figures are given below.   The current phase of acreage&#13;
expansion will be completed in 1982, and it is unlikely that substantial&#13;
further expansion will be undertaken in the near future.&#13;

operating costs over the years. Once the basic organizational structure&#13;
was securely in place, KTDA's costs per grower and per hectare began to&#13;
fall sharply in real terms.8/ The relevant figures are set out in Table&#13;

36.       There is no comprehensive economic evidence on the effects of tea&#13;
development in Kenya on smallliolder incomes, nor of income distribution&#13;
effects in the tea areas generally. What is immediately obvious even to a&#13;
casual observer, however, is ithe economic buoyancy of the tea districts,&#13;
the improved infrastructure, and the high standards of house construction&#13;
by tea growers compared to rural Kenyan standards. World Bank figures&#13;
derived from the second IDA project suggested that a smallholder planting&#13;
an acre of tea in 1965 would have enjoyed an increase in net income which&#13;
would reach 250% by the time the tea was mature, in 1974. More recent&#13;
calculations by the Commonwealth Development Corporation9/ and by Danish&#13;
researchers,lO1 which are broadly compatible with each other, suggest a&#13;
net annual income for the "norm" grower (0.4 ha. under tea) of about KSh.&#13;

3,850 for a mature tea garden in 1980. These estimates attempt to cost&#13;
labour at prevailing rates, rather than assume family labour with low or&#13;
zero opportunity cost. This is a realistic procedure, since it is widely&#13;
recognized that hired labour is extensively used even on below-norm tea&#13;
plots, in contrast to the original family-labour conception, and that&#13;
members of many tea-growing families work for wages outside their&#13;
holdings.l1/ Poor and/or landless inhabitants of the tea areas have&#13;
therefore derived direct benefit from wage employment on tea gardens, and&#13;
to a much smaller extent from employment at the tea factories, as well as&#13;
benefits from the roads, electricity and other infrastructure introduced to&#13;
some areas by KTDA.&#13;
37.       Actual incomes for most growers must be substantially lower than&#13;
the calculations referred to above--because of lower actual yields, because&#13;
of smaller than average holdings, and because of immature tea. Thus KTDA&#13;
paid out KSh. 365,286,422 to growers for the crop year 1980/81. Deducting&#13;
the greenleaf cess of 31 cents per kilo from the gross proceeds, and&#13;
excluding the 16,311 new growers who registered between 1978 and 1981&#13;
(and who would therefore be delivering no leaf), the Authority paid&#13;
KSh. 320,452,099 net to 121,521 growers. Average grower income from tea,&#13;
net of cess but gross of labour, fertilizer and other costs, was therefore&#13;
KSh 2,637. In the previous year, which was less severely affected by&#13;
drought, average grower income calculated on a similar basis was&#13;
approximately KSh. 2,900. These figures are very close to the level of per&#13;
capita GNP (though somewhat below average private sector agricultural&#13;

and Buch-Hansen, op.cit.&#13;

wages). Given that no growers derive their income exclusively from tea,&#13;
they indicate a comfortably above-average standard of living for Kenyan tea&#13;
growers.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
38.       KTDA's record, while certainly not without problems, is clearly&#13;
very impressive, particularly in contrast to the generally poor record of&#13;
smallholder tea schemes in South Asia and indeed in other parts of East&#13;
Africa. In Uganda, Tanzania and Mauritius, for example, tea authorities&#13;
with some formal similarities to KTDA have experienced major difficulties,&#13;
and have not been able to produce benefits to producers and to the national&#13;
economy comparable to KTDA's. A comprehensive comparison of the&#13;
performance of different smallholder tea schemes would doubtless highlight&#13;
instructive differences in the climatic, political and economic environment&#13;
as components of differential performance. These produced important&#13;
institutional constraints in some cases. The Tanzania Tea Authority, for&#13;
example, had to take direct responsibility for managing former private tea&#13;
estates when it was already struggling to meet smallholder planting targets&#13;
and to overcome resource and management problems. In Uganda, the Tea&#13;
Growers' Corporation had a much more diverse clientele than KTDA (including&#13;
very large growers), and less direct control over field operations because&#13;
of the intermediary cooperative structure. In Mauritius, the Tea&#13;
Development Authority has become essentially a (heavily subsidized) public&#13;
employment program, with the people who were intended to be independent&#13;
growers becoming paid employees of the Authority, with low productivity and&#13;
strong political resistance to any change in their status. It is&#13;
important, therefore, to assess the institutional features of KTDA itself&#13;
which appear to have made a major contribution to the success of Kenyan&#13;
&#13;

precipitate serious difficulties.&#13;

Section III. ACCOUNTING FOR KTDA's SUCCESS&#13;
39.       The preceding section provided an outline of KTDA's organization&#13;
and its achievements. Despite past and current difficulties, the record is&#13;
one of outstanding success--sufficiently so to require better explanations&#13;
than the generalities of "good management," "clear objectives," and so on.&#13;
40.       Some of the reasons largely external to KTDA have already been&#13;
touched on. There were favourable internal and technical conditions for&#13;
smallholder tea production by the early Sixties after the removal of the&#13;
colonial brake on African cash-crop development. In addition, over most of&#13;
the last two decades world tea prices have made tea an attractive crop for&#13;
African producers. The conjunction of domestic and international economic&#13;
conditions was therefore very encouraging, and external finance was made&#13;
available on attractive terms.&#13;
41.       Nominal economic attractiveness of a cash crop has not always&#13;
been a sufficient condition for its development, however. A number of&#13;
African examples can be cited where a mix of technical difficulties and&#13;
inappropriate government policies have produced stagnation or decline&#13;
rather than output growth even in apparently attractive crops. In some&#13;
instances, indeed, crops with high earnings have proved irresistible&#13;
targets for government taxation and control, to the point of drastically&#13;
reducing incentives to grow them.&#13;
42.       Kenya's smallholder tea industry has been spared such&#13;
attentions. Government has not levied special or onerous taxes on tea,12/&#13;
nor have there been non-tax mechanisms of any importance for reducing&#13;
12/ The initial loan agreement with CDC in 1960 in fact specified that&#13;
Government would not place an export tax on tea over the loan's 20-year&#13;
life.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28_&#13;
peasant tea proceeds.l3/ The general government policy stance has been to&#13;
maintain the operational autonomy of the Authority as the body managing the&#13;
smallholder tea programme, and to reap the benefits directly mainly in the&#13;
form of foreign exchange and indirectly in the increased output and&#13;
economic vitality of the tea growing regions. In notable contrast to many&#13;
other cases of public enterprises in Kenya and elsewhere, government has by&#13;
and large resisted the temptation to interfere in operational matters, or&#13;
to be frequently involved in managerial changes (although the Government&#13;
intervened directly to replace KTDA's general manager in 1980).&#13;
43.       Aside from the evident effectiveness of this policy in economic&#13;
terms, there are two broadly political factors helping to explain the&#13;
government's attitude--factors which might not, of course, recur in other&#13;
circumstances.&#13;
44.        The first lies in the origins of KTDA, or rather its predecessor,&#13;
the Special Crops Development Authority. In the early 1960's many of the&#13;
progressive colonial officials who had pressed for the expansion of African&#13;
agricultural opportunities were concerned about possible developments--&#13;
breakdown of control over the rate and quality of cash-crop expansion,14/&#13;
13/ See Accelerated Development in Sub-Saharan Africa: An Agenda for&#13;
Action (World Bank, 1981) p. 56 for nominal protection coefficients&#13;
for selected export crops in some African countries. Though the&#13;
database is of uneven quality, it clearly indicates that Kenya tea&#13;
growers have had a relatively low rate of effective taxation on their&#13;
crop. A partial exception to this generalization, however, is the&#13;
fact that KTDA (as well as the estates) is compelled to devote about&#13;
15% of its production to Kenya Tea Packers (KETEPA) for domestic sale&#13;
at prices substantially below world prices. However, effective&#13;
December 1981, the Kenyan Government did increase the price which&#13;
KETEPA must pay to KTDA and other producers.&#13;
14/ This was already happening rather rapidly in the case of coffee&#13;
planting.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- .29 -&#13;
and the possibility that a future independent government's policies would&#13;
interfere with or reverse the strategy of agricultural development already&#13;
underway. The SCDA, therefore, was intended to secure expert control over&#13;
smallholder tea development, in a form which was in large part independent&#13;
from day-to-day government influence. From the beginning, therefore, KTDA&#13;
had a more deliberately designed form of autonomy than did some of the&#13;
other parastatals involved in agriculture.&#13;
45.        The second factor determining KTDA's early policy environment was&#13;
the political importance of the tea-growing regions, and of the actual and&#13;
potential growers themselve!s. Tea is concentrated for the most part in the&#13;
thickly populated areas of Central, Rift and Nyanza provinces--all&#13;
important regions in the political map of Kenya. Moreover--although no&#13;
socio-economic survey of growers appears to exist--peasants growing tea&#13;
were not from the poorest segments of the rural population, but generally&#13;
from the "middle peasant" categories which have traditionally formed the&#13;
bulk of government's political support, with a substantial leavening of&#13;
larger and more prosperous growers from the peasant elite who tended to&#13;
form the district political, leadership cadre.&#13;
46.       KTDA's good performance would not in itself have guaranteed its&#13;
autonomy, even though the Authority's profitability and efficiency were&#13;
strong arguments in favor of operational independence. Those arguments&#13;
have been buttressed, however, by the strong support for autonomy on the&#13;
part of the foreign assistance agencies helping to finance tea development&#13;
and also within the Authority's domestic constituency. The natural,&#13;
financial, economic and po:Litical environments were therefore rather&#13;
favourable--and, perhaps e(ually important, relatively stable (this is, of&#13;
course, partly circular, s:Lnce it is KTDA's continuing good performance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30-&#13;
which helps to maintain those favourable circumstances).    What of the&#13;
internal institutional arrangements which underpin KTDA's performance? The&#13;
emphasis, in what follows, is on the extraction of themes which run fairly&#13;
consistently through the institutional and managerial practices of the -&#13;
Authority.   There is a potential cost of oversimplification in this&#13;
approach, of course. If the objectives are both to provide a systematic&#13;
account of KTDA's success and to draw some lessons of potentially wider&#13;
applicability, however, then coherence and systematic explanation are&#13;
essential--provided it is acknowledged that in the real world the&#13;
unexplained residuals of any particular case are likely to be substantial.&#13;
47.       Three themes are emphasized below:   deliberate institutional&#13;
design; control over strategic processes; and incentives and&#13;
accountability.&#13;
Institutional Structure&#13;
48.       Perhaps the most striking and important features of the Authority&#13;
as an institution are:&#13;
--   the deliberation and care which went into its initial design;&#13;
--   the emphasis (before it became universally fashionable) on&#13;
comprehensive and integrated service provision;&#13;
--   the development of a strategic planning capability to maintain&#13;
organizational innovativeness; and&#13;
the emergence of a distinctive structure and process-of&#13;
managerial control, based on clear and uncomplicated objectives.&#13;
49.       The political-economic anxieties of the terminal colonial period&#13;
were, it has been pointed out, partly responsible for the deliberation with&#13;
which the new entity was designed. It is apparent from the Working Party&#13;
report and from other sources that the structure and functions of the new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
authority were very carefully defined, and the relevance of different&#13;
institutional models for Kenyan conditions and for the particular&#13;
circumstances of cash crop development assessed. One key feature of that&#13;
design was an emphasis on the financial and operational autonomy of the new&#13;
body. There was an evident intention to insulate the Authority from&#13;
financial dependence on government: setting-up and development costs were&#13;
therefore to be financed largely by external sources (CDC, with latter&#13;
participation by the World Bank and other agencies). The introduction of&#13;
the leaf cess gave KTDA financial autonomy in day-to-day operations at a&#13;
later stage, when smallholder tea bushes began producing leaf. Financial&#13;
autonomy, an important prerequisite in this case, was complemented to a&#13;
large extent by operational independence. It was intended from the outset&#13;
that the Authority should have operational control over the crucial aspects&#13;
of tea production, and that control, wide from the outset, was rapidly&#13;
consolidated in the field ELnd factory sectors as KTDA developed.&#13;
50.       KTDA has therefore developed as a highly specialized,&#13;
comprehensive, vertically integrated commercial concern--although its&#13;
origin in the Special Crops Development Authority in principle might have&#13;
led to the development of a laterally integrated, diversified entity.&#13;
51.       That organizationt of KTDA, shown in Figure 1, is a sufficiently&#13;
good illustration of the ftnctional divisions and vertical integration of&#13;
the Authority. A static and formal rendering cannot, however, answer some&#13;
of the remaining important questions, to which we now turn.&#13;
The Sequence of Strategic Control&#13;
52.       How has KTDA developed and maintained a tightly managed mode of&#13;
operation, characteristic in many respects of efficient manufacturing&#13;
enterprises, when its productive base--peasant tea growers--is not in an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
analogous position to a firm's labour force, but is atomized and&#13;
autonomous?&#13;
53.       A crucial part of the answer, as the Introduction suggested, lay&#13;
in a sequenced control of certain strategic aspects of the cycle of tea&#13;
production.&#13;
54.        In the early stages of smallholder tea development, the most&#13;
important determinant of the scheme's success was the Authority's ability&#13;
to control the quality both of the productive stock (the tea stumps from&#13;
which pluckable bushes would grow) and of the producers themselves. From&#13;
the outset, therefore, would-be growers had to be registered with&#13;
SCDA/KTDA, and to obtain a license from the Authority permitting the issue&#13;
from government nurseries of a specified number of tea stumps. The&#13;
centralization of the tea nurseries in 1964 consolidated the Authority's&#13;
technical control over quality, and provided its field development staff&#13;
with an important resource for securing high standards among the&#13;
smallholders who had been licensed after a--sometimes difficult--selection&#13;
process.l5/&#13;
55.       The contrast between the record of planting control for tea and&#13;
for coffee is instructive. While control of tea acreages and growers was&#13;
largely successful during the 1960's, comparable attempts to control the&#13;
acreages and grower quality in coffee broke down in 1963-64, as would-be&#13;
growers rushed to establish or augment coffee shambas after the government&#13;
announced prospective tight planting restriction for all Kenya coffee. The&#13;
15/ Note that the quality of planting material also compensated to some&#13;
extent for any of the errors of judgment or influence-peddling which&#13;
are almost inevitably present to some degree when access to a prized&#13;
resource is administratively allocated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
hitherto quite strict official control could not be sustained because&#13;
planting material--coffee r,eedlings--existed outside government auspices,&#13;
in the cooperative society nurseries which were of course ultimately&#13;
within the growers' controL, not the government's. With control of that&#13;
crucial resource not in government's hands, subsequent attempts to rectify&#13;
overplanting through the uprooting of illegal coffee and the establishment&#13;
of additional regulatory powers were far more vulnerable to evasion and&#13;
political counter-attack, and were largely reversed.16/&#13;
56.       This is not to argue that government control over the crop&#13;
choices of peasants was necessarily desirable, nor that the reasons it was&#13;
undertaken were identical Ln the two crops discussed here.17/ The KTDA's&#13;
tight control over tea planting, however, greatly reduced the uncertainty&#13;
of its operating environment in three crucial respects: it had an&#13;
effective resource to influence the composition of its clientele, to&#13;
exercise close control over the quality of the initial stock of tea bushes,&#13;
and to induce growers to co-operate with the extension structure it was&#13;
putting in place.&#13;
57.        That locus of technical control remained of central importance&#13;
throughout the Sixties. New growers were being recruited in the successive&#13;
tea development schemes. The First Plan, completed in 1963/4, involved&#13;
bringing the total to some 20,000 growers on 10,500 acres; the Second and&#13;
16/ G. Lamb, Peasant Polit:ics, Julian Friedmann and St. Martin's Press,&#13;
London, 1974, pp. 83-109, deals with political pressures on coffee&#13;
policy in this period.&#13;
17/ In the case of coffee, for example, there was no great planting&#13;
quality issue, but a policy issue of acreage restriction under the&#13;
Intrernational Coffee Agreement and of maintaining a certain acreage&#13;
balance between smallholders and estates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34-&#13;
Third Plans had brought those numbers to 53,000 growers and 47,000 acres by&#13;
1971. At the same time, existing growers were being encouraged to bring&#13;
their holdings up towards the one-acre norm which was, and remains, the&#13;
Authority's target.&#13;
58.       By the beginning of the Seventies, however, smallholder tea was&#13;
well established, and peasant growers were beginning to pluck leaf in&#13;
substantial quantities. In the ten years between 1961 and 1971,&#13;
smallholder green leaf production rose dramatically from 464,000 kg to&#13;
about 20 million kg. The crucial point was now the control of leaf quality&#13;
and of manufactured tea.&#13;
59.       While extension agents and leaf officers could teach and&#13;
encourage farmers to pluck to a high standard, the most controllable aspect&#13;
of this phase of production lay within the factory. The factory's&#13;
industrial manufacturing operations could be closely monitored and&#13;
controlled: moreover, the factory could exercise considerable influence&#13;
over leaf quality through its function of buying (and if necessary refusing&#13;
to buy) leaf from collection centres.&#13;
60.       Direct KTDA involvement in factory operations from the late&#13;
Sixties onward therefore had an additional logic over and above any&#13;
"natural" tendency for organizational growth or any political impetus to&#13;
extend public sector activities in the rural sector. The factories&#13;
provided the Authority with leverage directly linked to plucking operations&#13;
and leaf quality, and therefore strengthened the position of leaf officers&#13;
and extension staff in their interaction with growers. The factories&#13;
became one more component of the coherent, incentive-based system of&#13;
controlled institutional tension which KTDA embodies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
61.        There is a further point to be borne in mind.    The maturing of a&#13;
substantial proportion of planted tea, the increasing experience of the&#13;
growers and technical advances in tea cultivation made possible--perhaps&#13;
made inevitable--a relaxatLon of direct control over planting material by&#13;
the Authority. Vegetative propagation was an appropriate, cheap and&#13;
efficient means of infilling gaps and gradually increasing individual&#13;
holdings, once the quality of the initial stock was established.&#13;
Agricultural assistants could--and do--continue to assist growers in&#13;
achieving high cloning standards, but the primary technical emphasis has&#13;
moved along the chain of production to the factory. Meticulous control at&#13;
the factory not only affects the efficiency with which leaf is converted&#13;
into made tea:   it also has an influence backwards on the standard of&#13;
cultivation and plucking.&#13;
62.        The instrument of planting material control has therefore been&#13;
largely retired from KTDA's apparatus of technical controls. This may have&#13;
been inevitable, since it Ls unlikely that experienced growers would have&#13;
taken long to master the new vegetative propagation technology.18/ The&#13;
reSidual control afforded by the licensing procedure, in any case, still&#13;
provides KTDA with some oversight of grower access.&#13;
63.        Both phases of strategic control--over planting, and over&#13;
factories--helped to reduce! the uncertainties inherent in dealing with a&#13;
large number of small producers. In part this is true because both were&#13;
18/ In FY 80, for example, almost half of the growers' total demand for&#13;
about 32 million VP cuttings was met from growers' own mother bushes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_ 36-&#13;
technically critical to the quality of production: concentrating&#13;
institutional resources on these elements therefore tended in itself to&#13;
improve quality. The controls were especially effective, however, because&#13;
they also conferred some indirect institutional leverage over other aspects&#13;
of tea production--field standards, receptivity to extension advice and&#13;
plucking practices--which were not within the direct control of the&#13;
Authority, and because they established a basis for instituting a highly&#13;
effective incentive system upon which much of KTDA's performance now&#13;
depends.&#13;
The Incentive and Accountability System&#13;
64.       The institutional structure of KTDA is designed to secure&#13;
relatively self-contained specialized functional divisions, but a smooth&#13;
flow of information both laterally and hierarchically, and effective&#13;
collaboration between staff performing different functions. That level of&#13;
efficient institutional operation cannot be built on exhortation nor on the&#13;
mere exercise of authority--especially since the majority of stakeholders&#13;
in the system (the growers) are autonomous, not employees. In an&#13;
organization as geographically widespread and socially diverse as KTDA,&#13;
enforcing accountability by direct managerial supervision and control would&#13;
have been very difficult and probably prohibitively expensive. It was&#13;
important, therefore, to build incentives and sanctions into the structure&#13;
and routine processes of the institution, rather than to rely purely on&#13;
managerial volition to secure efficiency, co-operation and high&#13;
performance. KTDA has managed to induce such performance to a remarkable&#13;
degree. How does this incentive system work for different sets of&#13;
stakeholders?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37-&#13;
The Growers&#13;
65.       For most smallholder tea growers in Kenya, the primary original&#13;
incentive to plant, care for, pluck and deliver tea was simply that it&#13;
allowed a far more lucrative use of land than those uses to which it was&#13;
previously put. For many growers this remains true. In the upper reaches&#13;
of the altitude on gradient ranges for tea, the opportunity cost of tea&#13;
land is low, particularly where dairy marketing structures are not well&#13;
developed. However, tea must compete with both subsistence and other cash&#13;
crops for labour, and in some cases with the latter as alternative uses for&#13;
tea land. Over a quite wide range of intermediate tea land, coffee,&#13;
pyrethrum and cattle are realistic alternatives; indeed in the last few&#13;
years relative prices for coffee and pyrethrum in particular have risen&#13;
substantially against tea, and produced worrying diversions of labour from&#13;
tea.&#13;
66.       The sanction against actually uprooting tea, however, is the very&#13;
high exit cost. The three-plus years of preliminary cultivation (to say&#13;
nothing of credit obligations and recurrent costs) represent a very big&#13;
investment for small growers, which they can ill afford to write off&#13;
against a short full-production period. Moreover, coffee (but not of&#13;
-course pyrethrum) is a substitute crop with very similar characteristics of&#13;
long gestation and high initial cultivation requirements.&#13;
67.       But while costs would deter most growers from abandoning tea even&#13;
under more adverse conditions than those of recent years, the task for KTDA&#13;
is to maintain positive incentives to deter a switch of labour to other&#13;
activities, relative neglect of bushes and a decline in the quantity and&#13;
quality of leaf deliveries.&#13;
68.        The first of those positive incentives is that KTDA provides a&#13;
"first payment," for green leaf on a monthly basis all year around given&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38 -&#13;
the continual growing season for tea--a payment which goes out to growers&#13;
from KTDA headquarters against their individual deliveries to leaf&#13;
collection centres. From 1977-81 that payment was KSh. 1.00 per kg. of&#13;
green leaf, raised in 1977 from a long-standing level of 88 cents. In 1981&#13;
the first payment was increased to KSh. 1.11 per kg. Growers are therefore&#13;
assured of a steady monthly income, based on their previous month's&#13;
deliveries, rather than having to wait (as in the case, for example, with&#13;
coffee) until their crop is processed and sold. The regularity of payment&#13;
is highly prized by the growers, and the Authority has devoted considerable&#13;
resources to making the greenleaf accounting and payment system streamlined&#13;
and efficient.&#13;
69.       This "security" incentive in the payment system is complemented&#13;
by a price incentive, provided by the variable annual "second payment."&#13;
The aggregate second payment is declared annually by the Authority: its&#13;
distribution among growers, however, reflects not only their leaf&#13;
deliveries by weight but the world market prices actually fetched for the&#13;
tea from the factory at which the particular grower's leaf is&#13;
processed.19/&#13;
70.        There is, therefore, a direct link between the quality of plucked&#13;
leaf (the single biggest field determinant of the quality of made tea) and&#13;
the second payment return to the growers. The variation in payments&#13;
between factories is quite wide, even though almost all KTDA tea falls&#13;
within the premium quality range. In FY 1980, for example, the mean second&#13;
payment was approximately KSh. 1.71 per kg. green leaf, with a range of&#13;
KSh. 1.24 to KSh. 2.63.&#13;
19/ KTDA is auctioned or contract-sold with individual factory&#13;
identification in the sale papers and stencilled on the tea chests&#13;
themselves.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
71.       It is clear, however, that this price incentive has some&#13;
ambiguities. Firstly, there is a classic "free rider" problem: since&#13;
second payments are at the same rate for all growers delivering to a single&#13;
factory, any individual grower may be tempted to deliver a greater weight&#13;
of poorer quality leaf in the belief that he or she could benefit from the&#13;
high-quality plucking of others. Secondly, growers are aware that&#13;
transport and factory operations also affect the quality and therefore&#13;
price of the made tea, and might therefore hold KTDA to be primarily&#13;
responsible for the level of payments.&#13;
72.       The free-rider problem is mitigated by both leaf-buying&#13;
procedures and group pressures. At leaf collection centres, growers can&#13;
be--and often are--instructed to re-sort their bags of leaf before they are&#13;
accepted for weighing, if a preliminary examination shows them to be&#13;
substantially short of the recommended "two leafs and a bud" standard. All&#13;
KTDA field staff, moreover,, constantly emphasize to growers the connection&#13;
between plucking quality and second payments, and the consequent damage to&#13;
common interests if some individuals fall short. The effect of consequent&#13;
group pressure is enhanced by making weighing and recording procedures at&#13;
collection centres as public as possible--a practice which also increases&#13;
grower confidence in the probity and accountability of the collection&#13;
staff.&#13;
73.       The second potential problem--that growers might wish to shift&#13;
responsibility along the process of production--is primarily dealt with by&#13;
machinery for grower participation. Firstly, prominent growers sit on the&#13;
district tea committees, and there is grower representation on the board of&#13;
KTDA itself. Secondly, growers are encouraged to become shareholders in&#13;
their factories, and do so in increasing numbers. Roughly one grower in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_ 40-&#13;
ten is a factory shareholder, with an average shareholding of just over&#13;
KSh. 500 yielding a dividend in FY 80 of about KSh. 40 per shareholder.&#13;
Shareholding and representation on factory boards confers influence,&#13;
increases knowledge and reduces the distance between factory and KTDA&#13;
management and the grower community, with positive effects on leaf&#13;
standards.20/.   It is worth noting the contrast between this "corporate"&#13;
model of grower participation and the more common cooperative types.&#13;
74.       Grower incentives are thus a shrewd blend of security, price&#13;
incentives and common-interest peer pressure, backed in the final analysis&#13;
by the high cost of tea. This blend can be adjusted. The 1981 increase in&#13;
the first payment from KSh. 1.00 per kg. green leaf to KSh. 1.11, for&#13;
example, was not an increase in prices paid to farmers, but a transfer from&#13;
second-payment funds, in effect. KTDA's calculation was that an increase&#13;
in growers' regular monthly income from tea was required to compete with&#13;
other potential agricultural activities--including in particular growers&#13;
going to work as daily-paid labour on tea estates. Further moves in this&#13;
direction are open to the Authority as circumstances dictate, although&#13;
there may be serious cash-flow constraints if grower remuneration is&#13;
weighted very heavily towards the first payment.&#13;
75.       An important feature of grower incentives is that they interlock,&#13;
as we shall see, with the incentives and sanctions facing other&#13;
participants in smallholder tea production--to form a system which for the&#13;
most part reinforces high standards of performance.&#13;
20/  It should be remembered, however, that these solutions are more&#13;
relevant to larger and more prosperous growers, who tend to&#13;
predominate on boards and committees and to become factory&#13;
shareholders. Some KTDA officials are worried that small growers may&#13;
come to feel alienated from the organization, and are, in addition,&#13;
harder put to find the labour necessary for high quality plucking.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
Field Staff&#13;
76.       Although particular features vary from one staff category to&#13;
another, the Authority's field staff encounter broadly similar incentives,&#13;
which may be grouped under four headings--terms of service, accountability&#13;
to KTDA, grower pressure, and factory demands.&#13;
77.       Most field staff are not permanent KTDA employees, but are&#13;
seconded from the Ministry cf Agriculture, their formal employers. They&#13;
have a small salary premium, but general terms of service are identical to&#13;
other ministry employees of equivalent grade. KTDA takes care, however, to&#13;
make employment attractive by a variety of minor perquisites: somewhat&#13;
better transport and housing conditions, vehicle loans, and so on. In&#13;
addition, KTDA is considered "elite" employment (symbolized for example by&#13;
the uniform worn by KTDA field staff), and therefore high performance is&#13;
more likely to be forthcoming to prevent re-assignment to Ministry duties.&#13;
78.       The accountability of field staff to KTDA is tightly organized.&#13;
The structure of authority is intended to enable close supervision at&#13;
successive levels. Supervisory staff are, however, fully stretched even&#13;
though the formal "span of control" does not seem so wide as to preclude&#13;
effective management of fie:Ld personnel. Field staff are also required to&#13;
maintain careful written work records--for example, leaf records and field&#13;
report books are required of leaf officers and agricultural assistants&#13;
respectively. These records seemed to be well designed, so as to provide&#13;
adequate information rather than to overwhelm managers with irrelevant&#13;
"noise."  Inspection and foLlow-up visits by supervisory staff are&#13;
frequent, and work records are often checked against supervisors' resulting&#13;
firsthand information.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42-&#13;
79.        It will already be apparent that tea growers are better placed&#13;
than most small farmers to exert influence on the agencies servicing them.&#13;
Both formally (e.g., through the KTDA Board and the Tea Committees) and&#13;
informally in direct discussion with KTDA staff, the growers are vocal&#13;
about their needs and quick to point out field staff shortcomings. It is&#13;
also evident that grower voluntary contributions (for example, in funding&#13;
and building leaf collection centres) legitimize their demands for&#13;
counterpart performance by KTDA staff.&#13;
80.       Finally, the demands of the factories encourage high performance&#13;
from field staff and growers alike, as the preceding section on technical&#13;
control discussed. For field staff, the task is to assure both leaf&#13;
quality (two new leaves and bud) and, as far as possible, a smooth sequence&#13;
of plucking and delivery to assist optimal rather than lumpy factory&#13;
throughput. The factories have greater leverage over the former than the&#13;
latter: lumpy deliveries are a consequence of post-rain "flushes" of&#13;
growth, as well as intensified plucking when children are home from school,&#13;
or at the end of the month to ensure maximum payment for that month. These&#13;
phenomena are only marginally susceptible to staff smoothing efforts.&#13;
The Factories&#13;
81.        It is established KTDA policy that the Authority wishes the tea&#13;
from its factories to compete at the premium end of the market. For&#13;
factory managers at least as much as for other stakeholders, this policy&#13;
provides an important measure of accountability. Their output can be&#13;
--and is--closely monitored, and the impersonal yardstick of market price&#13;
is the major test. The general incentive environment for factory managers,&#13;
therefore, is KTDA's quality policy itself.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43-&#13;
82.       More specifically, however, the organization provides managers&#13;
with wide operational autonomy--and its counterpart, responsibility--in&#13;
running their factories. The Authority maintains careful technical&#13;
scrutiny of fac-tory operations21/, and financial oversight through its&#13;
role as managing agent and secretary to individual factory companies.&#13;
Nevertheless, the autonomy of factory managers is real, and applies not&#13;
only to technical processes within the factory itself, but also to leaf&#13;
acceptance, tea grading and hiring and firing of labour--all of them&#13;
potentially sensitive areas both commercially and socially. Within that&#13;
framework, factory managers (many of whom are young, given the rate of&#13;
factory expansion) are able to call for technical and problem-solving help&#13;
on more senior group, regional or national staff.&#13;
83.        That accountability to the Authority is matched to some degree,&#13;
as we have seen, by answerability to the grower community. The growers&#13;
depend on the factory, once: high-quality leaf has been delivered, for&#13;
ensuring a premium-priced out-turn, and they have both formal&#13;
(shareholding) and informal (via field staff, or directly) channels to&#13;
complain if their expectations are not met. Several factory managers&#13;
pointed out, moreover, that: continued poor performance in the face of such&#13;
complaints could lead to a secular downward trend, since growers would not&#13;
bother to pluck to a high standard if factory performance was not&#13;
commensurate.&#13;
84.        The factory management career structure which underpins&#13;
accountability is still developing, given the rapid rate of factory&#13;
21/ Technical supervision is being strengthened by the establishment of a&#13;
Chief Factory Superintendent and five Group Factory Managers in 1982.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
construction in recent years, and the continued Africanization of senior&#13;
posts. As the system settles down, however, it is likely to allow not only&#13;
for managers' lateral movement (to larger or new factories, etc.) but also&#13;
for upward mobility. KTDA intends ultimately to have one group factory&#13;
manager for every seven tea factories, with a further headquarters-level&#13;
Superintendent grade.&#13;
85.       KTDA's record of factory management is a good one.     The&#13;
individual factories are on the whole efficiently run, although some of&#13;
them have suffered from external difficulties such as low initial leaf&#13;
deliveries, delays in delivering equipment and in construction or&#13;
extension, and power unreliability. Because of the small number of&#13;
privately-managed factories in the KTDA system (only four out of 24 in&#13;
recent years), a proper statistical comparison between KTDA- and&#13;
privately-managed factories is not possible. Nevertheless, statistics for&#13;
production efficiency (the made tea:green leaf ratio) and for tea quality&#13;
(growers' second payment as a reasonable proxy for factories' realized tea&#13;
prices) indicate that KTDA factories were performing at least as well as&#13;
factories managed for KTDA by private companies.&#13;
Senior Management and the Whole System&#13;
86.       The above broad decomposition of KTDA's incentive and&#13;
accountability system is incomplete without reference to those responsible&#13;
for strategic management of the Authority as a whole. For senior&#13;
management, the incentives are largely imposed'by the external environment.&#13;
It is then their task to create or adapt institutional structures so that&#13;
the Authority's internal constituencies respond efficiently.     KTDA has&#13;
managed to do this. Indeed, it is one of the striking features of KTDA&#13;
that the managerial response to external demands (for growth, price&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
competitiveness, Africanization, or whatever) has on the whole been robust,&#13;
expansionary and innovative, rather than defensive or seeking governmental&#13;
protection--although there are some indications that management may be&#13;
beginning to react defensively to current pressures, as Section IV&#13;
indicates.&#13;
87.        The major external incentive driving KTDA management is of course&#13;
the world tea market. In the short run, prices have tended to fluctuate&#13;
quite widely; in the longer run, the outlook appears to be one of prolonged&#13;
gradual decline in real terms. KTDA management has consistently refused to&#13;
insulate itself from that market, for example by building up large reserves&#13;
(or deficits) as so many agricultural marketing organizations in Africa&#13;
have done. In 1981, the accumulated green leaf price reserve was KSh.&#13;
15.38m., a mere 4.2% of current (1981) payment liabilities to growers,&#13;
while the 1981 accretion to the reserve represented only 0.14% of current&#13;
leaf payment liabilities.&#13;
88.        The only other reserves maintained by the Authority are a Factory&#13;
Finance Reserve (1981 accumulation KSh. 4.2m.) and a Fertilizer Finance&#13;
Reserve (1981 accumulation KSh. 21m.). In the former case, the reserve is&#13;
designed to provide temporary finance for factory construction in advance&#13;
of loan disbursements, and in the latter to finance fertilizer purchases'to&#13;
be recouped from later sales to growers. Neither significantly reduces the&#13;
need for commercial responsiveness on the part of the Authority. They are&#13;
relatively trivial in size.&#13;
89.        In a potentially adverse international market this competitive&#13;
leanness may even be seen as inordinately high-risk, particularly when&#13;
downward price pressure on tea may induce a switch of grower effort towards&#13;
other crops. There are two discernible reasons for KTDA management having&#13;
adopted the "risky" strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
90.       Firstly, there is still a good deal of room for improvement in&#13;
peasant productivity. The average made tea production of peasant growers&#13;
is approximately 700 kg. per ha. of mature tea, compared to average&#13;
production on commercial estates just over 2,000 kg made tea per&#13;
ha.22/--the highest levels in the world. Some but by no means all of the&#13;
differential is accounted for by the higher plucking standards and premium&#13;
tea production of the smallholder sector, so that there is price correction&#13;
to be made for productivity differentials. Maintaining peasant&#13;
responsiveness to market prices is seen as an important component of the&#13;
package of incentives necessary to induce improvements in grower&#13;
productivity towards estate levels, even accepting some increase in the&#13;
risk of growers switching towards other activities. The same incentive&#13;
reasoning is applied to productivity standards and cost controls within&#13;
KTDA's processing and marketing operations.23/&#13;
91.       Secondly, non-commercial financing, in the sense of large&#13;
surpluses or deficits, would invite government intervention and control&#13;
such as KTDA has not yet experienced. It is not merely that large&#13;
surpluses are an attractive political resource; it is also that KTDA&#13;
autonomy from government is in general predicated on efficient&#13;
performance. Management sees its operational freedom to be assured only by&#13;
22/ "Review of Green Leaf Yields: Kenya Tea Development Authority," W.D.&#13;
Ware-Austin and J.J. Rhodes, Commonwealth Development Corporation,&#13;
February 1982.&#13;
23/ The General Manager's report for 1980, for example, refers proudly to&#13;
the role of "improved management...[and] tighter costs and expenditure&#13;
control" in permitting a higher second payment, despite&#13;
drought-induced lower leaf yields and only a modest increase in the&#13;
general level of tea prices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47-&#13;
high standards of efficienc:y and the maintenance of high export earnings;&#13;
managers perceive, too, that dissatisfaction on the part of growers would&#13;
be an additional reason for political intervention. As one senior manager&#13;
put it,&#13;
"Growers ask us: 'Why should you ride around in a car,&#13;
while I have to walk? I am paying for you.' The only&#13;
answer we can givre which satisfies them is that we are&#13;
efficient and malke more money for them. Otherwise,&#13;
they would soon complain to the President."&#13;
92.       Market, government and growers thus all provide incentives for&#13;
efficient management--incentives which the Authority has up to now been&#13;
willing to accept. The "corporate ideology" behind that willingness cannot&#13;
be explained solely in terms of self-interest or outside pressure,&#13;
however. It also has had elements of technocratic and nationalist esprit&#13;
de corps. Pride in the success of KTDA as an indigenous Kenyan achievement&#13;
is very apparent, and KTDA's substantial and effective public relations&#13;
effort is built around that fact. The importance of external finance is&#13;
freely acknowledged, but the ability of KTDA to use that finance to build&#13;
an integrated and successful public-sector industry is also emphasized.&#13;
There is no doubt that KTDiA managers are keenly aware of comparisons&#13;
between their performance and that of privately-managed factories and&#13;
estates--not least because KTDA is much more completely Africanized than is&#13;
the private tea sector.&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
93.       It is apparent from this review that certain institutional policy&#13;
choices have been critical: meticulous organizational planning, commercial&#13;
orientation, operational autonomy, and close control over key technical&#13;
processes, for example. Within those strategic and more or less&#13;
consciously set parameters, the Authority has established an incentive and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
_ 48 -&#13;
accountability system which is to a significant degree self-reinforcing.&#13;
There is, in other words, an incipient tension between different&#13;
stakeholders--growers, field staff, factories, senior management--in which&#13;
it is in each group's interests to evoke high performance from others, and&#13;
in which each group also has some sanction or incentive power to do so&#13;
effectively. Output and efficiency do not, as is so often the case,&#13;
therefore primarily depend on one particular set of actors, who may either&#13;
be insufficiently motivated or see their efforts vitiated by other groups&#13;
with conflicting interest, over whom they have little or no control.&#13;
Instead, KTDA has deployed the potential conflicts of interest to drive the&#13;
institutional system rather than to obstruct it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
IV. CURRENT ISSUES AND CRUCIAL CHOICES&#13;
94.       A dominant theme running through KTDA's institutional experience&#13;
has been the importance of organizational flexibility. Despite&#13;
considerable background work and deliberation, the planners did not know&#13;
enough in advance to set up a "perfect" organization immediately, nor could&#13;
they anticipate all the changes which would affect it over the years. It&#13;
would have been unrealistic to expect otherwise. In fact, the SCDA and&#13;
later KTDA did go through a variety of changes and adaptations. Now, with&#13;
the Kenyan economy in serious difficulty and the world tea market outlook&#13;
worrying, KTDA faces new decisions, and will need to undergo further&#13;
adaptations to maintain its enviable record.&#13;
95.       Tea production in 1980/81 dropped abruptly, due largely but&#13;
probably not entirely to two years of drought (rain is considered to be the&#13;
most important climatic factor necessary for sustained high yields of&#13;
tea). Greenleaf production in crop year 1980-81 was aproximately 146&#13;
million kg against KTDA's projections of 206 million kg. The immediate&#13;
drop in the Authority's income (because, of the reduction in cess revenue)&#13;
has put it under severe financial pressure, at a time when its operating&#13;
costs (especially for transport of leaf and of staff) continue to rise&#13;
inexorably. The resulting deficits, if sustained, present the Authority&#13;
with difficult choices, given that it has deliberately avoided building&#13;
large reserves to draw on in difficult times. Requests to government for&#13;
special assistance could raise the possibility of more direct intervention&#13;
in its,affairs than has been the case so far. KTDA could increase the&#13;
cess, which has been pegged at 31 cents for some years--but probably only&#13;
with disincentive effects on growers whose tea proceeds have already&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5so&#13;
declined from the levels of previous years. Or it could review and&#13;
strengthen its cost management in an effort to improve efficiency yet&#13;
further.&#13;
96.       A substantial increase in the greenleaf throughput, however,&#13;
would without doubt have greater effects than such financial adjustments,&#13;
and indeed would be necessary for them to be effective. The key area for&#13;
improving yields lies in cultivation standards, according to the February&#13;
1982 CDC study of greenleaf yields (op. cit.). Smallholder standards of&#13;
fertilizer application, plucking and weeding remain below the optimum,&#13;
contributing to productivity lower than on the commercial estates. But&#13;
these factors are symptomatic of deeper causes; they suggest that extension&#13;
is still not as effective as it could be, and that research may either&#13;
provide inappropriate information for smallholder cultivation of tea or&#13;
lack good ties with KTDA extension. Some progress might be possible in the&#13;
short run, but the underlying causes of low cultivation standards will take&#13;
some time to resolve--changes in extension operations, discussed below, are&#13;
a good example.&#13;
97.       The immediate financial pressures, however, are also connected&#13;
with longer-term strategic issues which the institution's leadership must&#13;
resolve: how should KTDA set about consolidating and maturing this key&#13;
export industry, and what is the implication for the organization, style&#13;
and management of KTDA itself, now that the Authority is entering a period&#13;
of non-expansion for the first time in its history?&#13;
98.       The strategic issue which arises most immediately is that of&#13;
planting. The current planting plan will be completed in 1982. The new&#13;
plan calls for a halt on planting by new growers in order to bring present&#13;
growers' holdings up to desirable levels, to concentrate extension&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51-&#13;
activities on improving productivity, and to maintain high-quality leaf&#13;
standards.&#13;
99.       The halt on planting by new growers may have secondary effects,&#13;
posing new problems for KTDA. First, the authority recognizes the need to&#13;
reduce its extension staff unler the new plan, and will return 590 JAAs to&#13;
the Ministry of Agriculture, from whence they were seconded. What effects&#13;
this will have on the extension organization and staff morale remain to be&#13;
seen. A second more subtle problem has to do with labour on existing tea&#13;
plots. If (as seems to be the case) labour is emerging as a key difficulty&#13;
on many existing plots--either because of wage competition from estates or&#13;
because of other economic activities competing for family time--then there&#13;
is clearly a risk in consolidating around the existing grower population.&#13;
(On the other hand, hypothetically, would the costs of supervision and&#13;
other overheads for a new small-grower expansion be justified by the&#13;
prospect of increased leaf returns of sufficient quality, on the grounds&#13;
that the new growers would apply more labour more consistently to their&#13;
tea?)24/&#13;
100.      Given some improvements in data and good analysis, these&#13;
questions can be clarified to some extent. The completion of an adequate&#13;
tea census, for example, would enable comparison of numbers of bushes with&#13;
leaf deliveries, and enable conclusions to be drawn about productivity and&#13;
cultivation intensity for different categories of grower. But they also&#13;
24/ The issue of whether to extend tea cultivation to smaller growers than&#13;
at present is sometimes posed in terms of social or distributional&#13;
objectives, with a production or efficiency trade-off. This does not&#13;
clarify the issue particularly, since the choice must still be made&#13;
one way or the other, On production grounds, even if social&#13;
considerations are ignored.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 .&#13;
emphasize that KTDA is likely to have to change its own structure and&#13;
operations in future as well.&#13;
101.      The present organization, as we have seen, proved extremely&#13;
effective in managing the dramatic expansion and vertical integration of&#13;
the small-holder tea industry. It built, deliberately, on "middle&#13;
peasants" whose resources--and resourcefulness--established a strong base&#13;
for that expansion. If the rapid expansion phase is over, as it almost&#13;
certainly is, then KTDA will have to adapt key aspects of its operations.&#13;
102.      One area where changes seem needed is the extension service.    The&#13;
better established growers now know as much about tea as most of the&#13;
extension workers.   However, their leaf yields are still well below&#13;
potential, and their techniques of production inferior to the estates.&#13;
Successful growers are therefore likely to need fewer extension contacts,&#13;
but at a higher level of technical sophistication--particularly over such&#13;
research-linked questions as drought-proneness of different VP varietals&#13;
and optimal fertilizer use. These are questions which probably require&#13;
better qualified extension workers than most of those presently in place,&#13;
and a different organization of extension services. At the same time,&#13;
newer or less sophisticated growers will continue to require more frequent&#13;
contacts, and special emphasis on improved cultivation standards. The new&#13;
plan calls for increasing the existing farmer:extension staff ratio from&#13;
179:1 to 250:1, but using the new computerized greenleaf collection data&#13;
for identifying underproductive farmers. (The effectiveness of this&#13;
quantitative diagnosis remains to be proved). Although such changes may be&#13;
difficult to manage smoothly, they have the potential benefit of&#13;
establishing cost-effective career development structures for extension&#13;
staff--an important factor in maintaining morale and commitment when the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
period of major expansion is ending. A comparable issue arises in the&#13;
factory sector, where the career structure for managers will be important&#13;
in retaining KTDA-trained high quality personnel, and ensuring continued&#13;
efficiency in made tea production. The CDC report recommends that KTDA&#13;
staff salaries be competitive with the commercial sector, in order to&#13;
maintain staff quality.&#13;
103.      The Authority thus faces important choices in four crucial--and&#13;
obviously interrelated--areas. It must resolve current, perhaps growing,&#13;
pressure on its finances. It must advise government on--and&#13;
implement--strategic decisions about the organization of the smallholder&#13;
tea industry, if planting is indeed halted. It must improve the technical&#13;
base and productivity of its growers in the face of apparently increasing&#13;
difficulties in maintaining commitment of sufficient labour to tea.&#13;
Finally, it must devise and implement structural changes within KTDA&#13;
itself--especially in extension, financial control and the incentive&#13;
structure--to maintain its record of innovation and effectiveness. The&#13;
success of the institution has so far been predicated on continuous&#13;
expansion, both in tea acreages and into new functions (factories,&#13;
international marketing, etc.). It will be a severe test of the&#13;
Authority's continued creativity for it to manage the industry and improve&#13;
efficiency in circumstances closer to a steady state--and to do so,&#13;
moreover, when the relatively favourable economic and financial conditions&#13;
which accompanied the expansion period are no longer present.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54-&#13;
V. WHAT CAN WE LEARN FROM KTDA?&#13;
104.      KTDA does not provide a "model," either of rural development or&#13;
of public enterprise, which can be transferred more or less intact to other&#13;
countries or other circumstances. What can be done, however, is to extract&#13;
certain features of KTDA which are, from a managerial and institutional&#13;
point of view, unusually instructive--and which stand in marked contrast to&#13;
common patterns of inefficiency and ineffectiveness in agricultural&#13;
development and public sector intervention.&#13;
These features may be summarized as follows:&#13;
- organizational autonomy;&#13;
- control of strategic resources;&#13;
- effective accountability system; and&#13;
- effective incentive system.&#13;
Organizational Autonomy&#13;
105.      There is nothing new in emphasizing that relative freedom from&#13;
constant government interference is a basic requirement for enterprise&#13;
effectiveness. What is striking about KTDA is that its autonomy was&#13;
consciously designed from the outset in both financial and operational&#13;
terms, and stemmed in part from the peculiar circumstances of divided&#13;
political authority and concern about future policy at the end of the&#13;
colonial era. The maintenance of that autonomy over the ensuing two&#13;
decades can be attributed to two factors. Firstly, KTDA's consistent&#13;
success meant that factors which often motivate governments to interfere&#13;
were absent--like large losses necessitating baling out, or incompetence&#13;
necessitating reforms. Secondly, the political pressures which may have&#13;
existed for interference (e.g., KTDA as a possible source of patronage,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
etc.) were countered by the powerful domestic political constituency which&#13;
the tea growers became, and to some extent by the external sources of&#13;
financing which had a stake in KTDA's development.&#13;
106.       In many circumstances in developing countries this fortunate&#13;
combination is not replicated. Performance, even in a basically sound&#13;
institution, may be uneven; the institution's "clients" may be economically&#13;
weak and politically disorganized rather than effective and articulate; and&#13;
the material basis of the organization (the commodity or service with which&#13;
it deals) may not produce the revenue stream to put it in as strong a&#13;
financial position as KTDA's.&#13;
107.      Nevertheless, there are two points of general validity which can&#13;
be derived from KTDA's experience under the heading of autonomy.&#13;
108.       Firstly, if the objectives of the institution are clearly defined&#13;
from the outset, a set of performance standards can be derived against&#13;
which the institution can be evaluated, and government action designed&#13;
accordingly. This process can also be valuable in clarifying the extent to&#13;
which the institution is being entrusted with wider welfare objectives,&#13;
whose costs can be estimated and taken into account in the financial&#13;
relationship between the institution and government. In KTDA's case, these&#13;
secondary welfare objectives were not very significant. The organization's&#13;
political-economic relationship with government was correspondingly&#13;
simplified.&#13;
109.       Secondly, it is of primary importance that government policy&#13;
affecting the organization is implemented with strict propriety, i.e.,&#13;
through the institution's board or comparable body, on which government&#13;
will in most cases hold the dominant position. This has the effect of&#13;
preserving the operational responsibility of institutional management,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
while enforcing accountability for performance to the board and through it&#13;
to government itself. Direct intervention, for example in staff&#13;
appointments or day-to-day management, can vitiate painfully acquired&#13;
morale and effectiveness, among both managers and staff, extremely quickly.&#13;
110.      The converse problem must also be acknowledged:     of successful&#13;
institutions attracting resources and skills so as to weaken other parts of&#13;
the public (or indeed private) sector. As we have seen, this has happened&#13;
to some degree with KTDA, although the precise effects on Government or on&#13;
the private sector are very difficult to gauge. For some purposes this&#13;
flow of resources may be seen as an efficient market-surrogate allocative&#13;
mechanism. It is clear, however, that the effects on public institutions&#13;
which cannot by their nature generate substantial revenues may be&#13;
unwarrantably severe, with adverse effects on overall institutional&#13;
effectiveness and on social equity. The general policy stance adopted by&#13;
government in the Kenyan case seems broadly correct: to ensure that grower&#13;
beneficiaries paid as soon as possible for KTDA's services from the income&#13;
streams generated by tea development, and to place some limits on the&#13;
conditions of employment which KTDA could offer to field staff. The&#13;
broader regional and interpersonal distributional issues could not in any&#13;
case have been dealt with within KTDA itself; there would certainly have&#13;
been high costs in efficiency if this had been attempted (e.g., by imposing&#13;
social service obligations, or by milking KTDA revenues).&#13;
Control of Strategic Resources&#13;
111.      Organizational autonomy does not count for very much if the&#13;
organization does not command the resources necessary to function&#13;
effectively, or does not deploy them with appropriate priorities. Autonomy&#13;
was an important but not sufficient factor in KTDA's success; it would be a&#13;
mistake to allow autonomy to eclipse the importance of the other factors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
112.      KTDA had little cause for complaint about its formal powers;&#13;
indeed, these are potentially (and in the early days were often in effect)&#13;
autocratic. The Authority, as we have seen, had direct powers over all&#13;
aspects of production, processing and marketing except for tea roads. We&#13;
have suggested, however, that: comprehensive control was less important than&#13;
"strategic" control. It was more important to control planting initially,&#13;
and processing later on, than to have nominal authority over all aspects of&#13;
the smallholder tea industry.&#13;
113.      Organizational resources were therefore concentrated on the tasks&#13;
which were strategic to each phase of development. This stands in marked&#13;
contrast to many other examples of institutional development, where the&#13;
drive for bureaucratic growth often simultaneously creates both&#13;
organizational redundancy and under-deployment to key functions.&#13;
114.      Determining crucial objectives for different phases, securing the&#13;
capability to achieve those objectives sequentially, and deploying the&#13;
resulting institutional resouirces effectively are vital managerial tasks.&#13;
They are peculiarly difficult, perhaps, in conditions of innovation and&#13;
development, where prior experience is scarce, outcomes are uncertain, and&#13;
the opportunity cost of skilled personnel is high. KTDA could draw on the&#13;
valuable experience of the estate sector for many technical and managerial&#13;
questions, but for the central decisions about how to set up and run an&#13;
effective smallholder-based tea industry it was largely on its own, with&#13;
few models to draw on. Concentrating on the critical control variables was&#13;
an effective strategy for reducing risks.&#13;
Effective Accountability System&#13;
115.       The way KTDA's network of accountability works to enhance&#13;
efficiency has already been extensively discussed, and its general&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
implications for other development institutions will be apparent. Two&#13;
points may be worth re-emphasizing here.&#13;
116.      First, within KTDA itself accountability is a structural feature,&#13;
built into the way different segments of the organization--extension, leaf&#13;
collection, processing, and headquarters functions of management,&#13;
accounting and marketing--work in relation to each other. The information&#13;
system underpins that structure, as we have seen, in such a way that it is&#13;
generally in the interests of each participant both to secure adequate&#13;
performance from others along the production chain, and to provide the&#13;
information whereby management can readily identify sources of difficulty.&#13;
Unlike many development institutions, KTDA has not therefore been built on&#13;
unrealistic premises about what motivates staff performance. Thus while&#13;
there is no doubt that good morale contributes to KTDA's efficiency, this&#13;
is a "virtuous circle effect" of the basically sound and effective&#13;
organizational structure--and of course of the resulting buoyancy of the&#13;
smallholder tea sector. Again, training has been effective because it has&#13;
not been regarded as a solution in itself for performance problems, as is&#13;
so often the case, but as giving staff the skills to perform as well as the&#13;
institutional structure required them to do. Accountability for meeting&#13;
the Authority's performance standards drives the system and motivates skill&#13;
acquisition and pride in work--not the other way round.&#13;
117.      Secondly, KTDA is accountable externally as well--particularly to&#13;
its growers. We have pointed out that this is to some extent an&#13;
"objective" accountability, since it is not in KTDA's power to remove&#13;
itself from the grower's influence, whether at the level of an individual&#13;
grower's complaints about leaf grading at a district tea committee, at&#13;
national political level, or--most significantly--in growers' economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
responses to the set of incentives with which the market, mediated by KTDA,&#13;
presents them. This involuntary accountability has been an important&#13;
safeguard for growers against possible abuse of the Authority's&#13;
monopolistic position.   In this respect, it may offer interesting lessons&#13;
on the reform of African agrLcultural marketing monopolies in general,&#13;
whose overall record is cont:eoversial but whose disincentive and distorting&#13;
powers over client farmers have frequently been demonstrated.&#13;
118.      KTDA's example shows that this combination of internal and&#13;
external accountability can yield very good results. The individual and&#13;
collective interests of the clients--in this case the growers--are&#13;
forcefully represented, but the internal structure ensures that this&#13;
operates as a further pressure for general institutional efficiency, rather&#13;
than for the particular collusive advantage of some participants at the&#13;
expense of others. How such accountability systems can be established will&#13;
obviously vary widely from case to case:    indeed, it may often be difficult&#13;
to institute such systems ex ante, necessitating an adaptive and&#13;
experimental approach to this aspect of institutional design. The&#13;
principle, however, seems unassailable, and deserves careful attention in&#13;
institutional planning.&#13;
Effective Incentives&#13;
119.      The basic set of incentives for both growers and KTDA is provided&#13;
by world market prices, and we have noted that KTDA's incentive policy has&#13;
been to avoid insulating either itself or its growers from market&#13;
influences. This sustained economic pressure is used to enhance the drive&#13;
for premium tea production by demonstrating the direct link between premium&#13;
prices and grower returns. It also enhances the competitive leanness of&#13;
KTDA itself.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
120.       There are evidently risks in such a strategy, however.&#13;
Particularly where producers do not have substantial reserves to draw on,&#13;
adverse short-term price movements may of course produce longer-term&#13;
withdrawal. KTDA's solution--the first regular and second variable payment&#13;
system--has the great merit of providing farmers with a highly-prized&#13;
secure monthly cash income, maintaining the quality incentive with the&#13;
seasonal second payment, and yet staying within the bounds set by market&#13;
prices. The effectiveness of this system can best be judged, perhaps, by&#13;
observing that grower effort in tea has by and large been maintained in the&#13;
relatively difficult years after the 1977 boom, even in the face of&#13;
substantial relative price shifts in favour of pyrethrum and coffee. If&#13;
the more troubling signs in 1981 of grower movement away from concentrating&#13;
on tea are sustained, however, it is likely that the Authority will have to&#13;
experiment further with its security/incentive mix, perhaps by shifting a&#13;
greater proportion of greenleaf payments to the highly-prized regular&#13;
monthly payment, so as to provide growers with greater security in hard&#13;
times.&#13;
121.      KTDA's experience suggests that an incentive mix of this type may&#13;
have great attractions for organizations dealing with small producers,&#13;
provided that the cash flow generated by the agricultural output permits&#13;
such regular payments, and provided that incentives within the institution&#13;
provide compatible signals to staff.&#13;
122.      The combination of accountability and incentives has been&#13;
peculiarly powerful in KTDA's case, in large part because of the strong&#13;
role of external elements--growers, lenders and prices--in influencing the&#13;
Authority's decisions, and because of the Authority's commendable&#13;
determination that these influences should be maintained. There is of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
course no guarantee that KTDA or any other institution, however well&#13;
organized and managed, can successfully withstand radically changing&#13;
economic circumstances. It is clear, however, that the features singled&#13;
out for analysis in this paper have imparted a distinctive strength and&#13;
resilience to the institution to cope with challenges, so long as the basic&#13;
ground rules of its autonomy, control and accountability remain in force.&#13;
123.      This paper has discussed KTDA's performance primarily in terms of&#13;
its internal management, operations and policies, and in terms of the&#13;
Authority's relations with "stakeholders" in its immediate economic and&#13;
political environment: the growers, the Government, and the external&#13;
agencies which have provided it with financial assistance. It would be&#13;
valuable to extend this analysis, in future, to compare KTDA's achievements&#13;
firstly more systematically with other Kenyan public enterprises, and&#13;
secondly more generally with enterprises elsewhere in developing countries&#13;
which organize smallholder cash crop production and then process and market&#13;
the crop. It was suggested above that KTDA's success has been greatly&#13;
assisted by its financial autonomy (on both capital and current accounts)&#13;
and by the direct financial relationship between the Authority and its&#13;
growers, whereby KTDA was earning its revenue by providing its growers with&#13;
a paid service--and was accountable to them in important respects as a&#13;
result. This is clearly different from arrangements in some other Kenyan&#13;
public enterprises: the applicability of this direct enterprise-clientele&#13;
exchange relationship elsewhere in the Kenyan public sector warrants&#13;
further examination, particularly where enterprise autonomy and degree of&#13;
subsidy are at issue. Secondly, the contrast between KTDA and comparable&#13;
tea schemes in East Africa, r(eferred to briefly in this study, could&#13;
usefully be extended to include comparisons with enterprises engaged in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62-&#13;
outgrower and similar schemes for the production, processing and marketing&#13;
of cotton, copra, rubber and other export crops. Experiences in West&#13;
Africa and Southeast Asia, involving as they do both public and private&#13;
companies, could be instructive in this respect, and may well underline&#13;
some of the features of KTDA's success identified in this study.&#13;

            Control, accountability, and incentives in
            a successful development institution : the Kenya Tea
            Development Authority
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This paper analyzes the institutional
            factors in the success of the Kenya Tea Development
            Authority. It surveys the rapid growth of KTDA, the largest
            and most successful smallholder tea scheme in the world,
            with 138,000 growers, 24 operating factories, and production
            of around 33,000 metric tons of manufactured tea. The paper
            identifies organizational autonomy, strategic managerial
            control and an effective accountability and incentive system
            as the keys to KTDSA's institutional success. Current
            problems arising from market conditions and the maturing of
            the smallholder tea industry are discussed in terms of the
            institutional adaptations they will require KTDA to make.
            The paper also considers the relevance of KTDA's
            experience for other development institutions.
