                                                 ANNEX I&#13;
&#13;
                               DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT&#13;
&#13;
Introduction and Context'&#13;
&#13;
1. The South Asia region has both the highest prevalence of malnutrition and the largest&#13;
   numbers of undernourished children in the world. Malnutrition slows economic growth and&#13;
   perpetuates poverty. The combined effect of malnutrition on cognitive development (hence school&#13;
   performance), health status and cost to the health system, and productivity leads to a significant&#13;
   loss in GDP. Under-nutrition has been attributed to between 30 and 45 under-five mortality 2,3.&#13;
&#13;
2. In addition, the region has the largest number of people (over 295 million) who are routinely&#13;
    hungry; that is, they do not have daily access to adequate calories (FAO 2009) . India, for&#13;
    example, ranks 66 (out of 88) on the Global Hunger Index. The region has succeeded in&#13;
    increasing aggregate food production. However despite this achievement the poor and&#13;
    marginalized groups in the SAR countries face severe constraints to regular access and&#13;
    availability of food. Adding further pressures to this constrained food availability is the region-&#13;
    wide slowing agricultural growth, inefficient markets and restrictive trade practices.&#13;
&#13;
3. Progress in improving nutrition has been unacceptably slow (given positive economic&#13;
    trajectories). Given the current high levels and slow progress in the reduction of malnutrition&#13;
    during the past decade, most South Asian countries are unlikely to achieve the Millenium&#13;
    Development Goal (MDG) for nutrition (target Ic of MDG 1) of halving, between 1990 and&#13;
    2015, the proportion of people who suffer from hunger. Although there are declining trends in&#13;
    malnutrition compared to the rates 5 years ago, these rates are still alarmingly high. India,&#13;
    Bangladesh, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Nepal are among the 36 countries in the world which&#13;
    account for 90% of the global malnutrition burden.s The World Health Organization's global&#13;
    database on Body Mass Indices estimates that over a third of adult women in Bangladesh, India&#13;
    and Pakistan are underweight, and the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia ranges between 55%&#13;
    and 81% across the region.&#13;
&#13;
4. Improving the food and nutrition security (FNS) status of both children and adults is a key&#13;
    human development challenge for the South Asia Region. The lack of food and nutrition&#13;
    security - the foundation for human development - increases susceptibility to infections, increases&#13;
    related morbidity, disability and mortality burden (SAR also has a high burden of non-&#13;
    communicable diseases and the rising problem of obesity), and lowers lifelong learning capacities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The Section 'Introduction and Context' is included for information purposes only to reflect the main&#13;
considerations taken into account by the Parties in agreeing to support the Project.&#13;

                                                                             global progress&#13;

  China, Thailand and Brazil have taken bold actions to successfully accelerate reductions in under-nutrition,&#13;
and are on track to reach the first Millennium Development Goal on target, by 2015. India is expected to do so&#13;
only in 2043 at the present pace of actions.&#13;
&amp;#12;DCI-FOOD/2014/333-530&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     and adult productivity. Within this, a specific area of concern is inadequate nutrition for mothers&#13;
     and infants, especially in the "one thousand day" window - roughly the 1000 days from the first&#13;
     day of pregnancy through the first two years of life - since it imposes extensive, and largely&#13;
     irreversible, costs in terms of damage to physical growth, brain development, and consequent&#13;
     cognitive capacities and life-time human capital formation. This core focus on improving the&#13;
     nutritional status of infants (by directly targeting children in the vulnerable age group, their&#13;
     mothers as well as pregnant women) is absolutely essential to accelerate the reduction of child&#13;
     malnutrition, and decrease the overall burden of malnutrition over time.&#13;
&#13;
5. The challenge of hunger and malnutrition in South Asia is multi-faceted, and requires a&#13;
   multi-pronged approach, including interventions that: (i) expand availability, accessibility and&#13;
   diversity of food through improved agricultural production; (ii) enhance livelihoods; (iii) increase&#13;
   access to quality education; (iv) expand access to clean water and sanitation; (v) empower&#13;
   women; (vi) improve social protection; and (vii) focus on infant and child care, amongst other&#13;
   relevant areas. The region's economic growth has only had marginal positive correlation with&#13;
   improved nutritional status as evident from several country examples.&#13;
&#13;
Objective of the Project&#13;
&#13;
6. The objective of the Project is to improve FNS for individuals and communities in South-Asia&#13;
   through a strengthened commitment and increased capacity for more effective and integrated FNS&#13;
   actions across South Asia.&#13;
&#13;
Description of the Project Activities&#13;
&#13;
7.    The Project will fund activities that are demand-driven, focus on priority countries (as&#13;
     determined from time to time by the Donors Committee referred to in para. 21 below) and&#13;
     contribute to one or more of the following pillars:&#13;
&#13;
Pillar 1: Improved Evidence and Analysis&#13;
&#13;
8. This pillar is concerned with strengthening the substantive (evidential) and analytical basis for&#13;
   greater and more effective investments to improve FNS, including supporting thematic groups for&#13;
   better exchange of data and knowledge, re-orienting existing programs and innovating with cross-&#13;
   cutting, multi-sectoral approaches. Activities will be financed within this pillar under the&#13;
   following clusters:&#13;
   * Credible evidence base generated on specific FNS issues. Activities under this cluster may&#13;
        include, inter alia: identification of the precise channels through which undernutrition occurs&#13;
        in different contexts (shocks and vulnerability; Low Birth Weight pathways; early feeding&#13;
        and care practices; micro-nutrient deprivation; continuous re-infection due to poor sanitation&#13;
        and water, food pathogens, access to primary health care etc.) as well as its impact on welfare,&#13;
        both inter and intra-generationally; analysis of innovative approaches that link safety net&#13;
        programs with nutritional security - such as the early child development programs - will also&#13;
        be considered;&#13;
   * Improved data collection, analysis and management on key FNS issues. Activities under this&#13;
        cluster may include, inter alia: support for making data on nutrition more frequent, more&#13;
        accessible, and producing data of higher quality for larger areas.&#13;
   * Improved testing! impact assessment of FNS programs. Activities under this cluster may&#13;
        include, inter alia: activities resulting in better understanding of relative causal significance&#13;
        of various factors affecting undernutrition, or of policy trade-offs that obtain; investing in&#13;
        systematic evaluations of existing FNS-related programs to ensure timely learning to assess&#13;
&amp;#12;DCI-FOOD/2014/333-530&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        efficacy to help identify elements of feasible reform and to allow policy makers to consolidate&#13;
        of support for these programs.&#13;
        Improved analytics on specific FNS issues. Activities under this cluster may include, inter&#13;
        alia: Programming guidance (on various aspects of program formulation, implementation and&#13;
        monitoring) for country level partners, and other toolkits that can support government&#13;
        operations (e.g., supporting the updating of Food Composition Systems, which provide&#13;
        information on nutritive value of foods, and the basis for planning a satisfactory diet).&#13;
&#13;
Pillar 2: Enhanced Awareness and Commitment&#13;
&#13;
9. This pillar relates to building regional and country-level commitment to invest further in&#13;
   programs delivering FNS outcomes by increasing emphasis on it in various policies, development&#13;
   strategies and action plans. In particular, country policy makers and development partners have&#13;
   highlighted the need to understand and address the incentives for uptake and implementation of&#13;
   evidence based and integrated policy and programs to improve FNS. Activities will be financed&#13;
   within this pillar under the following clusters:&#13;
   * Improved Political Economy Analysis to inform strategies and action plans for promoting&#13;
        change. Activities under this cluster may include, inter alia: political economy analysis to&#13;
        understand the incentives and barriers for policy reform in FNS-related programs; analysis in&#13;
        each of the SAFANSI countries with the aim of identifying the underlying political economy&#13;
        dynamics and incentives structures that restrain or support effective multisectoral FNS action.&#13;
   * Networks established to build policy support and momentum for FNS actions. Activities under&#13;
        this cluster may include, inter alia:: creation of networks at the local, national and regional&#13;
        levels to function as "brokers" of credible research, analysis and information; selectively&#13;
        supporting high profile and high level events helps bring prominence and sustainability to&#13;
        such networks.&#13;
   * Strategic Communication and Outreach including through high profile events. Activities&#13;
        under this cluster may include, inter alia: a comprehensive Strategic Communications&#13;
        strategy to sensitize stakeholders to the need for action and mobilize public interest in the&#13;
        issue and create a public accountability mechanism for service delivery; a range of activities&#13;
        intended to identify, engage and reach key audiences; developing a regional network of&#13;
        'Ambassadors for Change' - influential policy makers or thought leaders committed to FNS -&#13;
        and equipping them with the means to influence others through statements in public fora and&#13;
        in the media; web-enabled dissemination of evidence and analysis.&#13;
   * Reports/ Assessments of FNS status and actions at various level. Activities under this cluster&#13;
        may include, inter alia: analysis of the 'State of Food and Nutrition' in SAFANSI countries&#13;
        to be used as a baseline assessment for the Project and as an in-house strategy document that&#13;
        guides a developing work program at the country level.&#13;
&#13;
Pillar 3: Building Systems and Capacity&#13;
&#13;
 10. This pillar relates to strengthening institutional capacities at regional, national and local&#13;
     community levels to help, on the demand side, by organizing and articulating community&#13;
     demands and, on the supply side, improving the quality and effectiveness of public programs.&#13;
     Furthermore, this component is expected to fill gaps such as: capacity to plan programs at scale&#13;
     (using evidence), capacity to implement programs at scale, capacity to manage in an evidence-&#13;
     based manner (generating and using data), capacity to advocate using evidence and political&#13;
     intuition. Activities will be financed within this pillar under the following clusters:&#13;
     * Improved monitoring and evaluation and learning (MEL) systems operational. Activities&#13;
          under this cluster may include, inter alia: the establishment of "Social Observatories" in a&#13;
          range of livelihoods programs to provide real time monitoring systems to substantially&#13;
          improve the practice and implementation of FNS-related interventions for community-based&#13;
          livelihoods programs.&#13;
&amp;#12;DCI-FOOD/2014/333-530&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    *   Networks of development partners established!strengthened/ trained! operational.Activities&#13;
        under this cluster may include, inter alia: establishment of a technical network of&#13;
        development partners - comprising entities in the UN system, Multilateral Development&#13;
        Banks, Bilateral Agencies, Government, civil society and philanthropic organisations where&#13;
        appropriate - will be built to contribute to the human resource needs of the system.&#13;
    *   Improvement in (existing) systems / capacities for technical stewardship program&#13;
        development! management and implementation. Activities under this cluster may include,&#13;
        inter alia: development and strengthening of systems for tracking comparative data across the&#13;
        region, such as gender and nutrition sensitive statistics for agriculture development and Codex&#13;
        Alimentarius data for food products in the region; provision of capacity support for the client&#13;
        countries through providing quality, experienced, technical personnel to work within&#13;
        government ministries.&#13;
&#13;
Pillar 4: Fostering Innovations&#13;
&#13;
11. Fostering innovations on the ground. The Project will seek to support three kinds of activities&#13;
    aimed at increasing innovations on the ground: (i) introduction or increased emphasis on FNS in&#13;
    existing project designs / operations; (ii) analytical and feasibility studies to support design of&#13;
    promising new interventions; and (iii) analysis, experience sharing, learning, program&#13;
    customization / contextualization etc. design to improve implementation approaches. Activities&#13;
    will be financed within this pillar under the following cluster:&#13;
    * Innovations in FNS-related projects and programs supported. Activities under this cluster&#13;
         may include, inter alia: facilitation of changes in the design of existing FNS programs or&#13;
        programs which want to add FNS interventions in their scope; financial support to pilot FNS&#13;
         programs.&#13;
    * Design of new FNS interventions supported. Activities under this cluster may include, inter&#13;
        alia: combating micro-nutrient deficiencies through food based approaches,bio-security risk&#13;
         management and food safety through the food chain, introducing different animal and fish&#13;
         protein sources in diets.&#13;
    * Development of new implementation approachessupported. Activities under this cluster may&#13;
         include, inter alia: effectiveness studies to test the impact of existing interventions, under&#13;
        normal operating conditions, including in challenging geographical environments and varied&#13;
         social and cultural environments, such as studies on interventions to address low birth weight.&#13;
&#13;
12. The Project strategy will add value to on-going efforts by exploiting gaps or overlooked&#13;
    opportunities for strengthening the FNS agenda and its operationalization. As such a necessary&#13;
    element of the Project will be exploitation of opportunities as they present themselves (rather than&#13;
    following through a rigid, time-bound plan which is characteristic of most projects). Effort will be&#13;
    made, therefore, to structure and resource the evaluation of the Project activities accordingly, i.e.,&#13;
    to focus on the impact and value-for-money aspect of the activity rather than consistency with&#13;
    strictly pre-specified target values.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
&#13;
           Multi-Country and Multi-Sector Approach&#13;
&#13;
13. The Project will promote an integrated and cross-sectoral approach to cover the critical issues&#13;
    involved in ensuring improved FNS. In the context of the regional level, a food and nutrition&#13;
    matrix with key indicators to monitor over a longer-term time horizon (10 to 15 years) will&#13;
    provide means for tracking the regional outcomes on achieving nutritional improvements for&#13;
    populations of interest. At country level 'State of FNS' baseline studies and their conclusions on&#13;
    entry points and opportunities, will inform a series of tasks each of which will demonstrably&#13;
    contribute to one or more of the four pillars described above. These tasks will either be Recipient&#13;
    Executed grants or Bank Executed tasks made in response to specific needs.&#13;
&amp;#12;DCI-FOOD/2014/333-530&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Links and synergies with other initiatives&#13;
&#13;
14. The Project will complement and supplement other initiatives in the region. In particular the&#13;
    Project will (i) be cognisant of the FNS status in each of the countries of operation and at the&#13;
    regional level (ii) explicitly work with existing networks of development partners and especially&#13;
    civil society networks and develop new networks where needed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
           Role of the various actors and stakeholders&#13;
&#13;
15. Rezional bodies represent important partners in developing FNS policies, setting norms and&#13;
    standards regionally and making the countries adopt consistent approaches to FNS issues.&#13;
16. Development Partners. Partners actively contributing to implementation of and investments in a&#13;
    multi-sectoral approach to under-nutrition. These may include bi-lateral and multi-lateral donors&#13;
    and other international organizations.&#13;
17. Governments. At central level, the partner governments from South Asian countries (Afghanistan,&#13;
    Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan, Sri Lanka) mainly through their sectoral&#13;
    Ministries and in particular the Ministries of Health and Social Welfare will be key partners for&#13;
    more effective and integrated food and nutritional security-related policies and investments.&#13;
18. Civil Society. The civil society is required as redoubtable partner to active support to raise their&#13;
    awareness and capacities to participate in public food and nutritional security-related programs.&#13;
19. Universities and Policy Institutes. Universities and institutes can provide significant resources to&#13;
    addressing the capacity gaps of the current system.&#13;
20. Private Sector. Finally, the private sector is also a critical stakeholder involved in agricultural&#13;
    inputs, and the storage, transportation, processing and marketing of food. The private sector is the&#13;
    source of income for many individuals, an important requirement for food security, and their&#13;
    policies and supply chains can have a substantial effect on availability, quality and price of food.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MDTF Governance Structure&#13;
&#13;
21. The governance structure for the MDTF will comprise a Donor Committee, the Secretariat and&#13;
    country focal points.&#13;
22. The Donor Committee will include each donor contributing to the MDTF and the Bank. The&#13;
    Donor Committee will provide strategic guidance and will review the annual work-plan and the&#13;
    overall progress and implementation of the Project. The Donor Committee will meet annually in&#13;
    person or virtually. Other stakeholders may be invited to participate in the donor committee&#13;
    meetings as needed.&#13;
23. The Secretariat will comprise the program manager supported by a small team of Bank staff. The&#13;
    Secretariat will be responsible for the day-to-day management and administration of the MDTF.&#13;
    In addition, the Secretariat will organize Donor Committee meetings, coordinate the allocation of&#13;
    funds and prepare annual reports.&#13;
24. A country focal point will be selected for each country in the South Asia region. The country&#13;
    focal point will be responsible for in-country coordination of FNS activities and partnership&#13;
    development.&#13;
25. In addition, the structure will also include designated Country Focal Points as "knowledge&#13;
    brokers" - one in each country - who will be responsible for portfolio management, coordination,&#13;
    and partnership development. Similarly, the FNS Spokespersons / Champions would be identified&#13;
    in each of the countries as senior opinion leaders with convening power to influence policy&#13;
    making and set the direction for highlighting FNS issues in each country.&#13;
&amp;#12;DCI-FOOD/2014/333-530&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Preliminary Risk analysis and mitigation plan&#13;
&#13;
26. The preliminary anticipated risks and the mitigation plan for the Project, which may be reviewed&#13;
    and updated from time to time by the Donor Committee and do not create any right or obligation&#13;
    on the Parties, can be categorized as follows:&#13;
    * Regional Level: (i) propensity to act nationally; (ii) lack of sufficient regional platforms/&#13;
        "space" to plan and coordinate regional actions; (iii) lack of established mechanisms for&#13;
        follow-through on regional agreements reached; (iv) logistical barriers in implementation&#13;
        coordination across national boundaries 6. However, favoring the Project is the fact that even&#13;
        at the regional level (e.g. SAARC) it is widely appreciated that food and nutrition security&#13;
        offers one of the best prospects for closer and more integrative regional work.&#13;
    * National/ Subnational Level: lack of adequate response by governments due to political&#13;
        economy factors such as; (i) other spending priorities and short-term goals; (ii) systemic&#13;
        inertia preferring existing arrangements; (iii) insufficient learning from\traction of Project&#13;
        messages; or (iii) deep institutional barriers to effective multi-sectoral work on FNS.&#13;
        Mitigation measures include: (a) actionable political economy analysis (PEA), focused at&#13;
        understanding and navigating around these constraints; (b) a PEA-informed&#13;
        outreach/communications strategy to empower a broad front of stakeholders and "champions"&#13;
        for change, at all levels; (c) enhanced learning from other countries'(cross-cutting)&#13;
        experiences to enlarge the (perceived) zone of feasible actions (notably from South-South&#13;
        exchanges).&#13;
    * Local Level: lack of adoption due to weaknesses in understanding Project messages and/or&#13;
        weaknesses in program design and implementation capacity. As such, Project design includes&#13;
        mitigation measures against these factors, including better learning and more accessible&#13;
        messages, and attention to design and implementation issues.&#13;
&#13;
Strategic Communications and Knowledge Management&#13;
&#13;
27. The Project will have a multi-pronged communications strategy. The strategy would focus on&#13;
    promoting cross-sectoral learning, generating awareness amongst various stakeholders at country&#13;
    and regional levels, maintaining visibility amongst key stakeholders, and focus on communication&#13;
    and outreach of key messages through periodic knowledge products and events.&#13;
&#13;
Monitoring&#13;
&#13;
28. The World Bank, as the administrator of the MDTF, will have responsibilities for monitoring the&#13;
    Project, in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
29. The Project will support activities at regional, national and community/household levels with&#13;
    indicative results, as follows:&#13;
&#13;
              (a) At the regional level it is expected that (i) an emerging set of standards (e.g. Food and&#13;
                  Nutrition Matrix of Key Indicators, Food Safety guidelines) will provide regional public&#13;
                  goods; and (ii) a network for cross-country learning can facilitate change at the national&#13;
                  level.&#13;
&#13;
              (b) At the national and sub-national level, the Project will focus on development policies and&#13;
                  plans that can; (i) expand the scale/scope and effectiveness of food nutrition safety (FNS)&#13;
                  operations, or (ii) facilitate improvements in the design of delivery mechanisms.&#13;
&#13;
              (c) At the community level, the Project results will relate to; (i) 'best practice' learning&#13;
                  through community projects, (ii) improved demand-side accountability for FNS-related&#13;
&#13;
6 These   risks are to be regarded as "given conditions", since any mitigation measure will be beyond the reach any such program.&#13;
&amp;#12;DCI-FOOD/2014/333-530&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
              public services, (iii) support implementation of local service providers that improve their&#13;
              systems and capacities, and (iv) foster innovations in FNS program and service to better&#13;
              address community and culture-specific needs. The cross-cutting foundation of this&#13;
              approach will be to create a conducive environment that allows a range of partners to&#13;
              increase the scale, scope and effectiveness of the FNS programs.&#13;
&#13;
30. The Commission and the World Bank agree that the above mentioned indicative results (as such&#13;
    may be reviewed, refined and updated from time to time) will be utilized by the World Bank to&#13;
    assess the progress achieved by the Project and will be referred to in the reports prepared by the&#13;
    World Bank pursuant to Article 2 of the General Conditions and Section 4.02 of this Agreement.&#13;
&#13;
31. Furthermore, the Project is intended to finance a program of activities, of which some will be&#13;
    executed by the World Bank and others by third party recipients, including World Bank's member&#13;
    countries, public/private sector entities and non-governmental organizations. The Commission&#13;
    and the World Bank agree that: (i) any indicators and results developed for the Project shall be&#13;
    indicative only in nature and subject to change for reasons beyond the World Bank's control and&#13;
    responsibility such as, but not limited to, policy or managerial actions or decisions of third party&#13;
    recipients of financing under this Project; (ii) such indicative indicators and results are to be used&#13;
    exclusively for monitoring purposes; and (iii) progress against such indicative indicators or results&#13;
    does not constitute a ground for the Commission to: withhold any amount of its contribution;&#13;
    withhold any payment under the schedule set out in Section 4.01 of this Agreement; or request a&#13;
    refund of any amount of its contribution already disbursed to the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Operations Manual&#13;
&#13;
32. The Project is going to be implemented, in accordance with an operations manual to be adopted&#13;
    by the Donor Committee, which will set out, inter alia: (i) detailed management and governance&#13;
    structures and arrangements; (ii) eligibility criteria/eligible sectors or themes, etc. along with&#13;
    details on the procedures for accessing funding; (iii) a logical framework matrix including&#13;
    baseline data and indicators and a methodology for monitoring progress under the Project and&#13;
    expected results; and (iv) multiannual indicative work-plan; (v) a strategy for communication and&#13;
    visibility.&#13;

&#13;
                                STANDARD PROVISIONS&#13;
&#13;
 This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all Administration Agreements&#13;
between the Bank and the respective Donors.&#13;
&#13;
1.     Administration of the Contributions&#13;
&#13;
1.1     The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set&#13;
forth in this Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or&#13;
responsibilities to the Donors, including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that&#13;
might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary&#13;
law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement shall be considered a waiver of any privileges&#13;
or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any applicable law, all of which&#13;
are expressly reserved.&#13;
&#13;
1.2     Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended&#13;
from time to time, including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and&#13;
safeguard policies, its framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its&#13;
screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line&#13;
with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the Security Council&#13;
taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge&#13;
that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist&#13;
financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual&#13;
member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
&#13;
2.1     The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and&#13;
shall be kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust&#13;
Fund may be commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in&#13;
its capacity as trustee, has legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States&#13;
Dollars (the "Holding Currency").&#13;
&#13;
2.3     Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in&#13;
their respective Administration Agreements.       In the case of deposits received in a&#13;
Contribution Currency other   than  the Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such&#13;
amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts&#13;
into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the&#13;
conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of&#13;
exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for&#13;
providing any additional financing.&#13;
&#13;
2.4     The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other&#13;
currencies as may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on&#13;
the date of the conversion.&#13;
&amp;#12;2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the&#13;
investment of trust funds administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from&#13;
such investment to the Trust Fund to be used for the same purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
&#13;
3.     Trust Fund Fees and Costs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
3.1     The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each&#13;
Installment, an amount equal to two percent (2%) per Installment as an administrative fee for&#13;
the Trust Fund.&#13;
&#13;
3.2     In addition, costs incurred by the Bank for other expenses, such as for program&#13;
management and Trust Fund administration, that are (i) not covered by the percentage&#13;
deduction specified above as an administrative fee and (ii) not included under Annex 1 of the&#13;
Administration Agreements in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures&#13;
shall be charged to the Trust Fund on an actual basis up to a maximum of five percent (5%) of&#13;
the total Contributions under all Administration Agreements.&#13;
&#13;
3.3    Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this&#13;
Trust Fund Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If&#13;
actual Contributions significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of&#13;
signature of the first Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust&#13;
Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this&#13;
Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by amendments made to the&#13;
Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable to all new&#13;
Contributions that are provided either as amendments to supplement existing Administration&#13;
Agreements or from new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;
&#13;
4.     Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;
&#13;
4.1    The Bank shall maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the funds&#13;
deposited in the Trust Fund and disbursements made therefrom.&#13;

disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions via&#13;

commitments and liabilities under the Trust Fund have been satisfied and the Trust Fund has&#13;
been closed, the final financial information relating to receipts, disbursements and fund&#13;
balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions shall be made available to&#13;
the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website.&#13;
&#13;
4.3     The Bank shall provide to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Fund Donor Center&#13;
secure website, within six (6) months following the end of each Bank fiscal year, an annual&#13;
single audit report, comprising (i) a management assertion together with an attestation from&#13;
the Bank's external auditors concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based&#13;
financial reporting for all cash-based trust funds as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial&#13;
statement for all cash-based trust funds together with the Bank's external auditor's opinion&#13;
thereon. The cost of the single audit shall be borne by the Bank.&#13;
&amp;#12;4.4     If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by&#13;
the Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to&#13;
whether such an external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the&#13;
appropriate scope and terms of reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope&#13;
and terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange for such external audit. The costs of any such&#13;
audit, including the internal costs of the Bank with respect to such audit, shall be borne by the&#13;
requesting Donor.&#13;
&#13;
4.5     The Bank shall make available to the Donors copies of all financial statements and&#13;
auditors' reports received by the Bank from Recipients pursuant to any Grant Agreements (as&#13;
defined below) in accordance with the Bank's Access to Information Policy.&#13;
&#13;
5.     Progress Reportin&#13;
&#13;

financed by the Contributions. Within six (6) months of the End Disbursement Date (as&#13;
defined below), the Bank shall furnish to the Donors a final report on the activities financed&#13;
by the Trust Fund.&#13;
&#13;
5.2     Any Donor may review or evaluate activities financed by the Trust Fund at any time&#13;
up to six (6) months following the End Disbursement Date. The Donor and the Bank shall&#13;
agree on the scope and conduct of such review or evaluation, and the Bank shall provide all&#13;
relevant information within the limits of the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All&#13;
associated costs, including any costs incurred by the Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is&#13;
understood that any such review or evaluation will not constitute a financial, compliance or&#13;
other audit of the Trust Fund.&#13;
&#13;
6.      Disbursement; Cancellation; Refund&#13;
&#13;
6.1     It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the&#13;
Bank by September 30, 2019 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The Bank shall only disburse&#13;
funds deposited in the Trust Fund for the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other&#13;
than returns to Donors) after such date to the extent such date is changed in accordance with&#13;
amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all the Donors. Following the End&#13;
Disbursement Date, the Bank shall return any remaining balance of the Trust Fund to each&#13;
Donor in the Holding Currency in the manner specified in its respective Administration&#13;
Agreement on a pro rata basis with regard to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by&#13;
such Donor relative to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by all Donors, all calculated&#13;
as Holding Currency amounts.&#13;
&#13;
6.2     Any Donor may cancel all or part of such Donor's pro rata share, and the Bank may&#13;
cancel all or any Donors' pro rata shares, upon three (3) months' prior written notice, of any&#13;
Contributions (paid and not yet paid) that are not committed pursuant to any agreements&#13;
entered into between the Bank and any consultants and/or other third parties for the purposes&#13;
of this Administration Agreement, including any Grant Agreements, prior to the receipt of&#13;
such notice. In the event of a cancellation, the Bank shall return to the Donor its pro-rata&#13;
share in the Holding Currency as specified in the Administration Agreement; unless otherwise&#13;
agreed between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
&amp;#12;7.     Disclosure; Dispute Resolution&#13;
&#13;
7.1    The Bank shall disclose the Administration Agreements and related information on&#13;
this Trust Fund in accordance with the Bank's Policy on Access to Information. By entering&#13;
into Administration Agreements, the Donors consent to such disclosure of their respective&#13;
Administration Agreements and such related information.&#13;
&#13;
7.2    The Donors and the Bank shall use their best efforts to amicably settle any dispute,&#13;
controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to the Administration Agreements.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
8.1    The Bank shall, as administrator of the Trust Fund on behalf of the Donors, enter into&#13;
one or more grant agreements (the "Grant Agreements") with recipients (the "Recipients")&#13;

conditions set forth in the Grant Agreements. Grant Agreements may be entered into up to&#13;
the maximum amount of the Contributions that all Donors have agreed to make available&#13;
under the Administration Agreements between the Bank and the Donors.&#13;
&#13;

Grant Agreements. Subject to the consent of any relevant Recipients, representatives of the&#13;
Donors may be invited by the Bank to participate in Bank supervision missions related to the&#13;
Trust Fund.&#13;
&#13;
8.3     The Bank shall promptly inform the Donors of any significant modification to     the&#13;
terms of any Grant Agreements and of any contractual remedies that are exercised by      the&#13;
Bank under any Grant Agreements. To the extent practicable, the Bank shall afford        the&#13;
Donors the opportunity to exchange views before effecting any such modification           or&#13;
exercising any such remedy.&#13;
