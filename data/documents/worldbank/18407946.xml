&#13;
GRATHWOL: Tom, if you'd begin by talking about your birth and your birth family, I'd&#13;
appreciate that.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Sure. Thanks. I was born in Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I'm going to stop and ask you to say your full name, spell it for me, and then&#13;
continue.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: The name is Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn-B-1-i-n-k-h-o-r-n. There's an&#13;
interesting story about that name, which I'll tell you in a minute.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: But I was born on October 1, 1935, in a town called North Sydney, Cape&#13;
Breton Island, in Nova Scotia. North Sydney is a port town, not a city really, a town. And it is&#13;
from there that the ferry from Nova Scotia-since Cape Breton is part of Nova Scotia-the ferry&#13;
departs to the province ofNewfoundland (as we say it in Canada-Newfoundland--not "New&#13;
Found Land," but Newfoundland). And the ferry goes from North Sydney to Newfoundland and&#13;
back.&#13;
&#13;
I was born in my grandmother's house in North Sydney. And after I was born, my family moved&#13;
to the adjacent town of Sydney Mines, which is about five miles away, along the coast. That is a&#13;
mining town. It's a coal mining town. At the time that I was growing up-or was born and&#13;
started to grow up--it was in economic decline. The story is rather similar to coal mining sagas&#13;
arOlmd the world, as I discovered later in my World Bank career in Ukraine.&#13;
&#13;
But the story, to summarize it, goes like this: In the early 1900s, the Dominion Coal and Steel&#13;
Company, which was a large state-owned Canadian enterprise, discovered large veins of rich&#13;
coa1 under the North Atlantic that ran from Sydney Mines, at the pit head, out into the sea-&#13;
under the sea. And there was a steel mill in the larger town called Sydney that used coal for the&#13;
energy source. And the Dominion Coal and Steel Company was looking desperately for&#13;
experienced miners. So they put a call out to Scotland and England, where there had been coal&#13;
miners for a long, long time.&#13;
&#13;
My grandfather, William Blinkhorn, had been working in a mining community in the town of&#13;
Wigan. And Wigan is right next to Liverpool. You may have read George Orwell's book, The&#13;
Road to Wigan Pier. Well, The Road to Wigan Pier is about that. There was another story about&#13;
that Wigan experience called Rose, by Martin Cruz Smith. It's a marvelous novel that came out&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                               June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      2&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
in 2000.&#13;
&#13;
In any event, my Grandfather Blinkhorn-and there's a story about how did the Blinkhorns-it's&#13;
a very strange name. It's actually, it turned out-as I did some genealogical research later on in&#13;
my life-a Dutch name. And the Blinkhorns came from the Netherlands-Holland-to work in&#13;
the textile mills of Lancashire County, England, in the 1700s. If you look around the British&#13;
Isles, you will find that most of the Blinkhorns are there in Lancashire County, or in the northern&#13;
parts of England, on the border with Scotland.&#13;
&#13;
In any event, my Grandfather Blinkhorn worked there, and he married a-he was a non-Catholic.&#13;
He married an Irish woman from County Mayo, Ireland, and she was a Catholic. And she&#13;
insisted that he become a Catholic, and he did. Liverpool then, as now, is known as the second&#13;
capital oflreland because there are more Irish people living in Liverpool, apart from, say,&#13;
Dublin, so the second capital.&#13;
&#13;
So this Irish woman and my grandfather-my grandparents-took up the deal to go to Cape&#13;
Breton, because they offered free passage across the Atlantic, and they offered a free home, and&#13;
they started their new life with a young son in Sydney Mines.&#13;
&#13;
My grandparents had e:ight boys and one daughter, and all of the boys went into the coal mines to&#13;
work except my father, Ambrose. He was, apparently, a favorite of my grandmother, and she did&#13;
not want him to go into coal mining because it was extremely dangerous work. They had to go&#13;
down deep shafts and out under the sea to work on their hands and knees and dig coal; very, very&#13;
hard, grueling, terrible work and very, very dangerous.&#13;
&#13;
My grandfather was involved in many accidents, saved the lives of many men, and was quite a&#13;
leader in the sense that early, as they got into the work, they realized that their labor was being&#13;
priced lower than other miners, so they started organizing. The Dominion Coal and Steel&#13;
Company did not like that, and so there were strikes. The miners-and my grandfather was a&#13;
leader of them-organized cooperatives in Cape Breton and eastern Nova Scotia, in&#13;
collaboration with priests at St. Francis Xavier College, in Antigonish, Nova Scotia. And the&#13;
priests and the miners collaborated to form bakery cooperatives, milk cooperatives, and credit&#13;
unions, and they did very, very well for themselves.&#13;
&#13;
Well, by the time I was born, in the mid-'30s, there was a depression, of course, in North&#13;
America, as well as other places, and the coal mining business was starting to run down.&#13;
Eventually, it collapsed entirely. There are no coal mines left in Cape Breton Island.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: When were you born?&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: I was born October 1, 1935.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: That had been my guess.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16,17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    3&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes. Yes. And by that time, when I was growing up, I grew up in a very, very&#13;
poor town, a very, very poor community, and there was not too much food. I went to school&#13;
with kids that were very hungry and did not have proper clothing. I was brought up a Catholic,&#13;
and the nuns and the priests took care of me and us.&#13;
&#13;
I don't know that I want to get into the personal business of my father and mother because it was&#13;
a difficult relationship. In any event ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Not necessary.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes. He insisted that his son should be named Ambrose. She insisted that her&#13;
son--to give you a flavor of what was about to unfold; later on it got worse-but she wanted to&#13;
name her first born son after her father, Thomas Francis Brown. And so they had this big&#13;
dispute. And when I was baptized at St. Joseph's Church in North Sydney, my grandmother-&#13;
maternal grandmother-she whispered in the priest's ear, and she took care of the priest. "Now,&#13;
Father," she said, "make sure that that child is named Thomas Ambrose not Ambrose Thomas."&#13;
And that's the way it was. And my father was pissed off. And from then on, he wouldn't call me&#13;
Tom. He called me Junior. He got even.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: But that sociological background is relevant to some of the things you were&#13;
involved in at the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: It is. Oh, for sure.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I want to ask more about that when we get to that point.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes. Yes. That has a major impact on my life, that experience. Plus, later the&#13;
training of the Jesuit priests and the emphasis in the Catholicism that I was brought-on social&#13;
justice and your obligation to the less fortunate; very, very powerful.&#13;
&#13;
That coincided with one of my great heroes, was Jack [John F.] Kennedy. I covered the&#13;
Kennedy campaign in 1960, when I was working as a newspaperman in Milwaukee. All of that&#13;
comes together. And there was that idealism, really, that was behind the motivation and the thrill&#13;
that I eventually found in working for a place like the World Bank because that opportunity&#13;
exists in this place to do that kind of thing and feel good about it.&#13;
&#13;
In any event, I did relatively well in school. My father, he had a whole variety of jobs on the&#13;
railroad. He went out during the war. When all my uncles were going off to war, he did not&#13;
want to go to the war. His mother tried to help him get out of the war, so he went out to the&#13;
west, to Winnipeg, to help with the grain, loading grain on cars. So I didn't really see too much&#13;
of my father when I was growing up. So I was brought up pretty largely by my mother and my&#13;
grandmother, both the maternal and paternal grandmothers, and I had a lot of aunts. So I was&#13;
pretty largely brought up by women. That also had an impact on me, if you look back-the&#13;
absence of the father and the lack of a relationship with my father had a big impact on me.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
In any event, when I was getting ready to finish high school and think about what was coming&#13;
next, my Irish grandmother said, "Well, you're doing well in school, you have to leave here.&#13;
You can't stay here because there's no jobs here. The coal mining is finished. It's not going to&#13;
exist anymore, and if you stay here, you'll be on welfare, you'll be getting in fights, you'll be&#13;
getting drunk, you'll get some girl pregnant, and just look around you." It was clear all around.&#13;
&#13;
So she urged me to go to the States. And I had several connections in the States because a lot of&#13;
the--my mother's family was also large, from North Sydney, and all of those aunts and uncles&#13;
ended up in the Boston area, in Magnolia, on the North Shore, or Manchester. And then a lot of&#13;
them were on the South Shore, in Dorchester and South because they were Irish, and they went&#13;
down there, and they were "Southies," working as firemen and whatnot.&#13;
&#13;
So I went to Boston on a train. My grandmother got me a ticket, and I went on the train to&#13;
Boston and picked up with my Aunt Veronica and aunts. My hope was that I would be able to&#13;
go to Harvard. I had always heard from one of my friends in Sydney Mines who went offto do&#13;
big things that that was the place to go, and that was always my dream. But I was not that good,&#13;
and I didn't have the money.&#13;
&#13;
So, let's see. It was another relative of my grandmother. It was her brother, as I recall, who had&#13;
been a priest, a Jesuit priest. And through connections there, l-and that priest was in&#13;
Cincinnati, as I recall, at Xavier University. So I went there, and I had an Uncle John who lived&#13;
there, John Blinkhom. So I stayed there for a while. And I actually finished up high school at&#13;
St. Xavier High School in Cincinnati. One day my uncle was saying to me, "Well, where are&#13;
you going to go to school?"&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Well, I think I'd like to write."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, let's talk to Uncle Such-and-Such," who was the Jesuit priest. And he said,&#13;
"Well, you know, there's a great journalist at Marquette University who was running their&#13;
journalism department, Jeremiah O'Sullivan. He has a marvelous communications program; Let&#13;
me see if he'd be interested in taking on someone like you."&#13;
&#13;
So through those connections-those family connections-and mainly through the Catholic&#13;
Church-the priest-! was given an introduction to Jeremiah O'Sullivan. I took a train and went&#13;
up to Milwaukee. I talked to the dean, and he said, "Okay, you can start."&#13;
&#13;
So that's where I went to school. I went to school in Milwaukee, studied journalism and a lot of&#13;
English, and got a degree in journalism. The summer between my junior and senior year, I went&#13;
back to see Uncle John in Cincinnati, and he said, "Now, what are you going to do?''&#13;
&#13;
By this time, my father had decided to move to Cincinnati, and he came. My mother was still in&#13;
Sydney Mines. She eventually sold the house and then moved with my sisters; But he came. He&#13;
and my Uncle John were saying, "Now, what are you going to do now with this when you get&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                 June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   5&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
out?" My father was very disappointed that I went in this direction. He wanted me to go to a&#13;
vocational school to be an electrician or a plumber or something. He just couldn't figure out how&#13;
are you going to be able to make a way for yourself writing. What the hell is that?&#13;
&#13;
So he-I think it was John who said, "Well, just go down and see if you can get an appointment&#13;
with the editor of The Cincinnati Post or The Cincinnati Enquirer and see if they take interns.&#13;
And if you can get an internship between your junior and senior years, that will really give you&#13;
firsthand experience, and then you can decide what you want to do."&#13;
&#13;
So I went to The Cincinnati Post first, and the managing editor told me, "Yeah, you're going to&#13;
Marquette. We know Marquette. Come back in June when you get out, and we'll see what we&#13;
have."&#13;
&#13;
I wc::mt to The Cincinnati Enquirer and met a marvelous Southern gentleman by the name of&#13;
Glenn Thompson. And Glenn was a Princeton graduate, who had been editor of the Dayton&#13;
Daily News, and he was hired away to come down and be editor of The Cincinnati Enquirer.&#13;
And he had this nice Southern drawl, and he talked like this. He asked me about who I am. He&#13;
was very intrigued with where I grew up in Cape Breton, and the coal mining part and all of that&#13;
stuff. And he says, "Now, let's see." He says, "Son, if you were to come to work here at this&#13;
newspaper, where do you suppose you'd like to see yourself in, let's say, five years?"&#13;
&#13;
And I said to him, "I'd like to be sitting in your chair, Mr. Thompson."&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "You come to work immediately as soon as you get out."&#13;
&#13;
He and I got along. He then became my mentor. He was just a great guy, and I just loved him.&#13;
&#13;
When I graduated from Marquette, I married one of my classmates, Lois Werner, who is from&#13;
Waterloo, Iowa. We graduated one day and got married the next. We drove down to Cincinnati,&#13;
and I started my job at The Enquirer as a reporter the week later.&#13;
&#13;
Glenn Thompson was determined to challenge me all the time. And he would say, "Now, you go&#13;
in to see George Carr." And George Carr was the city editor. In those days-! don't know if you&#13;
know what a city edition is-it was like the movie Front Page. I mean, half of them were&#13;
drunks, but brilliant drunks, and the other half were just normal reporters, but all characters. In&#13;
the center of this circus was a guy by the name of George Carr. And George was the meanest&#13;
son of a bitch you could ever see. He had just a gnarly look on his face from morning until&#13;
night, but very smart. He taught English at a small-Berea College in Kentucky is where he&#13;
taught.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I know the name.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, that's where he taught. And he knew grammar and English. And you got&#13;
started by writing obits. You had to type it on paper, using Royal typewriters, and take it and put&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
it in. And we'd hear, "Blinkhorn, Blinkhorn, how do you spell Cincinnati" or stuff like that.&#13;
And he's screaming at me, "Is that what they taught you in journalism school at Marquette?" It&#13;
was just a total embarrassment.&#13;
&#13;
I was there like about four days-and this is a morning newspaper-and I was working from&#13;
like, say, four o'clock in the afternoon until midnight. The thing that got me in with Carr, I&#13;
mean, I was already Glenn Thompson's favorite boy, although he did not want to push me onto&#13;
Carr. And the way I got to Carr was that one time, it was just before deadline. I think the last&#13;
edition-there were several editions in those days; the last edition went to bed around 12:30 or&#13;
something like that. And they could hold the presses until1 :00, but they didn't like to do it.&#13;
&#13;
So around a quarter to 12:00 the newsroom was cleared out. I was just sort of sitting around, and&#13;
in comes a major explosion on the north side of the city. All hell is breaking loose. And Carr&#13;
looks around and there's not a soul. He said, "Oh, Jesus." I could see his face. He said,&#13;
"Blinkhorn, get your ass up there to da-da-da. There was an explosion and call it in right away&#13;
because we're against deadline."&#13;
&#13;
So I jump in the car and speed up there. I didn't even have a press pass. I was so new they didn't&#13;
give me a press pass. But when I got up to the scene, all the police lines were formed. And&#13;
here's this young punk coming a policeman asked, "Yeah? Where's your press pass?"&#13;
&#13;
I didn't have one. "God, what am I going to do now?" So I snuck around and got over and got in&#13;
and finally asked a friendly looking fireman, "What the hell happened here?"&#13;
&#13;
And he told me, "Well, the boiler in the basement blew up, and two people have just been taken&#13;
out of here. Two of them are dead that I know of, and there's more."&#13;
&#13;
So 1 got back on, and I started calling in the story. He said, "Great! Great! Yeah, now what&#13;
else?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "I can't get anything else. They won't give me anything."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "What do you mean?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "You didn't give me a press pass."&#13;
&#13;
So the fact that I was able to get something in for a story convinced him that, well, maybe we'll&#13;
try out this kid. And then they assigned me to cover the circuit court of appeals, the federal&#13;
circuit court of appeals.&#13;
&#13;
I used to cover Judge Potter Stewart, who eventually came onto the United States Supreme&#13;
Court. I had more education from journalism, as a reporter, than 1 ever got in any college. I was&#13;
amazed. I learned all about the federal government, the structure of government, because I was a&#13;
Canadian citizen. I was not a-and I learned. I used to go into the immigration office in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
federal building here and just see these people taking the oath, and see what they had to do to&#13;
become a citizen, then learn the differences in the court systems; how the court of appeals&#13;
worked in relation to federal district court, and that was just having to write about it and being&#13;
forced to do it under a deadline, and to write about it clearly so that some poor bastard who had&#13;
maybe an eighth-grade education could understand it.&#13;
&#13;
And that training was invaluable to me for the rest of my life, and particularly in the World&#13;
Bank. It really saved me in the World Bank because I was not an economist. I was not a big-&#13;
tim~~ anthropologist or anything like that. But the fact that I had this discipline and could do it&#13;
quickly and could do it persuasively, in terms that ordinary people could understand, including&#13;
executives, intelligent people as well as non-intelligent, that was a skill that I learned the hard&#13;
way. It really has served me all my life.&#13;
&#13;
Eventually-! always wanted to go back to Milwaukee because, in those days, the Milwaukee&#13;
Journal was a damn good newspaper, a really, really first-rate newspaper. So after a year or so&#13;
in Cincinnatti, I wrote a letter to Arville Schaleben, who was the managing editor, and I said,&#13;
"Look, this is what I've been doing. I really want to come back to Milwaukee. I went to school&#13;
there," blah, blah, blah. And he hired me on the basis of a letter.&#13;
&#13;
So I went to work at the Journal, in Milwaukee, and that was another great experience. By this&#13;
time, I had-let's see, my first child was not born; she was born in '59, Ann, who incidentally&#13;
was in The New York Times Corporation and is a big shot with The New York Times, and works&#13;
for an executive recruiting organization in New York, she's the head oftheir media operations.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, Ann was born and then two more children came along. So my first wife, Lois, and I&#13;
had three children. Lois was a housewife. I was a journalist, and I was pretty-! was very&#13;
ambitious. I did police work, and I had a lot of exciting stories as a police reporter.&#13;
&#13;
Then they asked me to start working on economics and business, which I did do. And all the&#13;
while I was doing this, I kept an interest in Canada. And the Journal had won a Pulitzer Prize&#13;
for Canadian coverage several years before I got there. And the writer behind it was a guy by the&#13;
name of Austin Wehrwein, who was hired away by the Minneapolis Tribune. Austin served out&#13;
his days on the Minneapolis Tribune.&#13;
&#13;
So there was a vacuum when I got there on Canadian coverage, and I knew that the Journal was&#13;
strong on Canadian coverage because it was in sort of the northern part of the United States, but&#13;
it also happened that Lindsey Hoben, the editor, his mother came from New Brunswick. And so&#13;
he loved the fact that I came from Nova Scotia. So there was sort of a little inside cabal there.&#13;
&#13;
I would be covering--and damned if they didn't ask me to go cover the Canadian election&#13;
campaign. And I went up there, and I covered, you know, I ~as just a young guy, and I went all&#13;
over Canada with Lester Pearson and John Diefenbaker and covered the national election&#13;
campaign. I met all kinds of fascinating characters doing this.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I also-well, before that, when John Kennedy was running in '60, you know, the Wisconsin&#13;
primary was big time, a big deal. So I covered Kennedy. I'll never forget in Lacrosse,&#13;
Wisconsin, he tried to get Jackie up on the stage. And you know she was always so prim and&#13;
proper, and he said, "Smile, Jackie. Smile." And I was sitting right up front so I could see this.&#13;
&#13;
I covered Teddy. Teddy was very young and wandering around. And through that experience, I&#13;
got to know the head of the editorial board, Paul Ringler, who was from North Dakota, a really&#13;
nice man and a close friend of Lindsey Hoben's.&#13;
&#13;
In those days, the Journal had six editorial writers, and each one was specializing in certain&#13;
areas, like state government or politics or economics and finance and blah; blah, blah. The guy&#13;
who was their specialist in economics and finance was a guy by the name of John Pomfret. John&#13;
was our labor reporter, who had been hired to do editorials. When you were hired to do&#13;
editorials, you were paid more because it was a promotion, and you were part of sort of the inner&#13;
circle ofthe newspaper. So John was hired away by The New York Times.&#13;
&#13;
Scotty [James] Reston, who was the Washington bureau chief for The New York Times, hired&#13;
John to come and cover labor in Washington, and eventually the White House. John then went&#13;
on--in those days-I should digress and tell you that the Milwaukee Journal used to be the&#13;
training ground for a lot of New York Times young executives. And Punch [Arthur Ochs]&#13;
Sulzberger, who is the father of Arthur Sulzberger, now the publisher of The New York Times,&#13;
Punch Sulzberger spent his summers in Milwaukee learning to be a reporter for several years and&#13;
became close friends with John Pomfret.&#13;
&#13;
So when John was covering the White House and there was a labor dispute in New York-and&#13;
John knew all the labor leaders-Punch said, "Come on. I need you up here to help me deal with&#13;
this strike." John came up, left the reporting, and eventually went into the business side of The&#13;
New York Times and became the financial vice president of The New York Times.&#13;
&#13;
When he left the Journal, Paul Ringler offered me the job of being an editorial writer, covering&#13;
finance and economics. And I said, "Jesus, I don't know anything about finance and economics."&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "Yes, but you've been writing about American Motors, and you're going to do this,&#13;
and you can learn on the job."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Well, shit, it's a promotion. I'm going to take it." And I needed the money, you&#13;
know, because I started out making $76 a week. And then I went up from there, $105 or&#13;
something like that. But, I mean, this was a substantial raise, and I had children, you know, and&#13;
whatnot. So I was very happy to do that so I could buy-we were living in an apartment. I&#13;
could buy my own house.&#13;
&#13;
So I got into this editorial thing. The other beauty of this was that the Journal in those days had&#13;
a lot of money for foreign travel. So Ringler arranged for me to go to Europe to cover the&#13;
formation of the Common Market. And one of the key contacts that he and Lindsey Hoben, the&#13;
&#13;

                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     9&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
editor, put me in touch with was William [D.] Clark.&#13;
&#13;
William Clark they had known from the war years, when William was a counsel for the United&#13;
Kingdom government in Chicago. William was a journalist. He had worked for The Observer&#13;
and for the London Economist, and he went on to be the press secretary for Anthony Eden, when&#13;
he was the prime minister. So Paul and Lindsey wrote a letter of introduction to William when I&#13;
got to London, and he just started opening all kinds of doors to me. He was very, very kind to&#13;
me. He took me into the Houses of Parliament.&#13;
&#13;
I saw Winston Churchill come in and make a speech for-one of his last speeches, which I wrote&#13;
a story about. He then introduced me to people in Paris. I met Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who&#13;
was the finance minister and then became-and I went to interview Gerhard Schroeder in&#13;
Germany. I was 24 years old, 25, and I'm just thrown into this stuff. It was just exhilarating. I&#13;
was writing stories about the government.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I can imagine.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: All of a sudden I'm an expert of the goddamn Common Market. I didn't even&#13;
know what it was.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Those are all big names.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: I can drop them with the best.&#13;
&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: William and I stayed in touch with each other. After that, they sent me to Asia.&#13;
I went to the Philippines, Okinawa, Hong Kong, Japan, report back. And then they asked me to&#13;
do--just go across Canada from wherever you want and write about Canada on its centenary, the&#13;
1OOth anniversary. As a Canadian, I just-I went way the hell up to Inuit, on the Bering Strait,&#13;
and wrote about Eskimos. I went to every one of the provinces and ended up in my little old&#13;
hometown, and it was so much fun. I just wrote about what Canada was like. They gave it big&#13;
play, big, big play.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: That's terrific.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: So here I am now, I'd been there maybe-I'm in my early 30s, and again I'm&#13;
getting myself into trouble because the editorial board was very liberal. The publisher was not&#13;
that liberal, and there was always a delineation between the business side of the newspaper and&#13;
the editorial side. And we kept that wall right there, and we didn't want any publisher mucking&#13;
around with that.&#13;
&#13;
But then in the late '60s-incidentally, I covered the-with the whole team-the 1968&#13;
convention in Chicago and all the riots and all the civil rights ferment, and it was really coming&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
into all the cities, including Milwaukee. I was really impressed by the black leaders, in talking&#13;
about how terrible the education system was for their children. The big issue was busing. The&#13;
issue was, should we bus black kids out into these all-white schools because, if we don't, they'll&#13;
be marooned and stuck forever. I believed that that was the thing to do. In retrospect, I was&#13;
wrong, and it was damn wrong. But I believed it, and I got into a big shouting match with Paul.&#13;
&#13;
Paul was trying to-by this time, though, I was not only covering economics and finance, but&#13;
they also asked me to cover education, and that's how I got into this. The publisher did not like&#13;
what I was doing at all, he told Paul. And Paul said, "Oh, God, Tom. I don't know what to do."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, Paul, I think maybe I've done this long enough. I think I want to take a break. I'm&#13;
going to try and see ifl can get a Nieman Fellowship at Harvard."&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You had taken some time out to go to the University of Wisconsin as well.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Well, I was doing that at night.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So, while you were working as a reporter.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: While I was working as a reporter, I was studying at night. I had all this&#13;
energy, and I was just ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: It's wonderful to be young, isn't it?&#13;
&#13;
BLllNKHORN: Oh, yeah. I can't do it anymore. And Lois was fantastic because she is a very&#13;
good writer. And she eventually-after we got divorced-went on to become the book editor&#13;
and the managing editor ofthe Milwaukee Journal. She's a very, very talented woman, and she&#13;
happens to be one of my best friends. That's another story how that happened.&#13;
&#13;
At any rate, I got the Nieman Fellowship. I went to Harvard, and I went to Harvard to study&#13;
economic development, and to study why do some societies grow and thrive, and what are the&#13;
ingredients of success, economically and socially, and why do some do it and why do some not.&#13;
Why are African societies so backward? Why do the North African societies-some of them are&#13;
good-Morocco and Libya, if it didn't have oil and whatnot-those kinds of issues.&#13;
&#13;
Harvard was fantastic. It was just one of the-it was everything I'd ever dreamed about as a kid.&#13;
I just loved it. I just loved being in Cambridge. The beauty of the Nieman was that you could&#13;
focus on your area of study, but you were treated as a real notable-the faculty and the students&#13;
and vitas[?], the president. We could go anywhere, and I just loved it. I mean, I was going and&#13;
having lunch with Walter Jackson Bate, the great Samuel Johnson scholar. I would have lunch&#13;
with Ken [John Kenneth] Galbraith, I knew very well. I was introduced to his family. It was just&#13;
such a heady environment. I learned a lot and had some great friends.&#13;
&#13;
By this time, now, I was developing a network of people in journalism world, but then, beyond&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
journalism world, people who were in academia and who were-Bobby [Robert F.] Kennedy&#13;
came to talk to us. I was getting networks into the political environment. Ed Bailey went on to&#13;
become head of the USIA [United States Information Agency] under Kennedy. He had been a&#13;
political correspondent at the Milwaukee Journal and so forth and so on.&#13;
&#13;
So I'm in my 30s, and I'm trying to see what the hell should I do next. And I went down to&#13;
Newsweek. All the Nieman class goes down to Newsweek to talk to The Times and have lunch&#13;
down there every year. I went over to Newsweek because one of my cohorts-one of my student&#13;
colleagues was a Newsweek correspondent and introduced me to one of the editors, Rod&#13;
Nordland. Is it Rod? No, it's not Rod. He just died about two months ago. That's not the&#13;
correct first name.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: That's the sort of thing we can correct.&#13;
&#13;
BL1[NKHORN: In any event, he said, "You have a lot of experience in this, and you're in&#13;
economics." He said, "Why don't you come and work with us?"&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Well, I have an obligation to go back to Milwaukee because they not only supported&#13;
me in this thing, but they also supplemented my income." Because when you're a Nieman, you&#13;
get a stipend and it's low, so the Journal, very generously, topped it up to make sure that I&#13;
wouldn't have to-so I could spend the year studying and not worry about where the money was&#13;
coming from because I came from a poor background, and they knew that. So they were good,&#13;
and I felt an obligation to go back there for a while. So I said, "Well, I'd like to do it, but I think&#13;
I have to go back at least for a year."&#13;
&#13;
At the same time, one day William Clark came to Harvard to meet with a friend of his, Roger&#13;
Fisher, who was in the law school at the time and wrote the book, Getting to Yes: Negotiating&#13;
Agreement Without Giving In, the art of successful negotiation. So William and I had dinner. I'd&#13;
known him, as I mentioned earlier, from London and whatnot. By this time, he had been hired to&#13;
be the vice president to [RobertS.] McNamara. He said, "Well, you're doing the right thing by&#13;
going back, but you ought to think about doing something different. These are exciting days at&#13;
the World Bank. Everything is changing. McNamara is doing things, so I think you ought to&#13;
give it some thought. So let's stay in touch with each other and see whether that might work out&#13;
for you."&#13;
&#13;
So I went back, and I stayed a year. In that year, I did some interesting things. I not only&#13;
covered the '68-let's see, the late summer of '68 in Chicago, the big Chicago convention, but&#13;
they sent me to-the Journal sent me to Israel and the Arab countries. I went to Egypt and to all&#13;
the Gulf States, to Saudi Arabia.&#13;
&#13;
In Egypt, I made contact withAl Fatah, and they arranged for me to go to their training camp in&#13;
Jordan, outside of Amman, myself and a Belgian radio reporter. They picked us up at 4AM in an&#13;
Amman hotel, blindfolded us, put us in the back of a truck and drove for about three hours, God&#13;
knows where. And when we got there, we were in the Al Fatah training camp and watched all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                 June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
these Islamic fundamentalists jumping through trenches of fire. I wrote a story about this with&#13;
these guys, these kids jumping through fire, and it was all over the world because there were not&#13;
too many people finding out about those training camps in those days. So I was very lucky on&#13;
that.&#13;
&#13;
Then I went to Israel. I had to go through Cyprus to get to Israel because they didn't want the&#13;
stamping of the passports and everything. And while I was in Israel, I was having lunch with the&#13;
political editor of Haaretz, the big Israeli newspaper. And the prime minister, Levi Eshkol, had&#13;
just died. And I said to this man, I said, "Who's going to be the new prime minister?"&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "Oh, yes, Golda. Golda Meir is going to be the next prime minister."&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: From Milwaukee.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes. And I said, "Jesus, is that right? She has a Milwaukee connection. She&#13;
used to teach there. I'm with the Milwaukee Journal, too. Can you get me in to see her?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Of course."&#13;
&#13;
So he called her secretary, and she was very excited. And she said, "Of course, tell him to come&#13;
over."&#13;
&#13;
So the next morning I went over to Golda Meir's office, and I said, "Is it true?"&#13;
&#13;
She said, "Yes, they're going to announce it this afternoon."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Can I use it?"&#13;
&#13;
She said, "Sure."&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Terrific.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: So I got on the phone right away and called in the story, and the Journal was so&#13;
excited. They used it on television, radio, front page, all the rest. I had my picture taken with&#13;
Golda, and she was chain-smoking Chesterfields. I'll never forget it. She just couldn't-and all&#13;
her fingers were just covered with nicotine. She was telling me how she used to dress up as an&#13;
Arab in disguise and go across to Jordan to talk to King Hussein about how we could possibly&#13;
solve this mess. She said, "I've been over there so many times, and no one knows about that."&#13;
And she said, "Don't say it now, but use it after I die. And I did after she died."&#13;
&#13;
So I did that for a year, and then I said, "William, what could I be doing?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, look, there's lots of things that you could be doing, but Bob wants to expand&#13;
lending to Africa. We'd like for you to come and just to get to know the Bank and do some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 13&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
writing with Africa, help us put together a strategy for quadrupling lending to Africa and just sort&#13;
of get a feel for the Bank. But you're a writer. You know economic development, you know&#13;
economics, so why don't you come and see what you think."&#13;
&#13;
So I came, and I joined what was then the External Relations Department. This is in 1970. I&#13;
think it was February of 1970 that I arrived. I left the family in Wisconsin, and I was on my own&#13;
for a while. We eventually got a house in North Chevy Chase, and they moved out. But I had a&#13;
terrible time with the Bank. I was coming from-what?-12 or 13 years of freedom. When I&#13;
wrote, except for people like George Carr in Cincinnatti-and there are other stories about the&#13;
city editor of the Milwaukee Journal which I could tell you about, but, you know, except for&#13;
those people and correcting-and they knew grammar, and I was wrong and they were right, and&#13;
I knew it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes, you were learning.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: I was learning. I knew how to write and I knew how to write well, and I knew&#13;
that. Everyone recognized that, and they applauded that. I got to this place, and I had to change&#13;
everything. I had to learn the bureaucratic style of writing, and it was extremely painful. I had&#13;
to have it vetted with other people who did not know how to write. They may have known&#13;
something about this subject or that, but I was-they couldn't figure out who the hell I was&#13;
because I was not a Ph.D. economist. But I had William Clark, just going around ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: As a patron.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, as a patron. And through William I got to know McNamara. And&#13;
McNamara-I'll tell you about this. Most of these bureaucrats, they don't know what-who in&#13;
the hell is this Blinkhorn? So I had great difficulty in the Bank in adjusting to this environment.&#13;
It took quite a while for me to come to terms with the Bank. Even though I knew that the Bank&#13;
was doing honorable, worthy things, I just couldn't figure out where am I going to work, where&#13;
am I going to end up. After I had done it for a few months, I said to William one day, "Look,&#13;
William, I don't know how"-and the good thing about William, he had been a journalist, and he&#13;
knew something about what I was suffering.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: The transition you were going through.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, but he was a vice president, and he was up in the upper circles. He had&#13;
McNamara's ear. I was down in these trenches, and I had to deal with these idiots-what I&#13;
thought were idiots. As it turned out, I was wrong about that because it turns out they were good&#13;
people.&#13;
&#13;
But he said, "Okay, I'll tell you what. You come to Copenhagen with us."&#13;
&#13;
Now, I started in February, and the Annual Meeting is in September. And I said, "What the hell&#13;
am I going to do there?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, you know, all hell is going to break loose in Copenhagen because McNamara is&#13;
still regarded by the students in Europe and the left wing as a warmonger. And we know that&#13;
there's going to be a lot of protesting, and what I would like you to do is two things: one is to&#13;
prepare a briefing book for McNamara, asking the nastiest kinds of questions that you can, and I&#13;
will give it to him so that he is ready for anything, number one; number two, pick out a couple of&#13;
people that you like in the staff, good, young economists, and go there early and set up some&#13;
meetings with students and engage in debates and do it." So that's exactly what I did.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This is two years after the 1968 revolutions throughout Europe, and there's a lot&#13;
of ferment going on.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: A lot of change.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Oh, a lot, big change.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And challenge of authority.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Absolutely, absolutely. And so I prepared a red book, and I called it Dirty&#13;
Questions or I called it Irreverent Inquiries, Alias Dirty Questions. McNamara loved it. I started&#13;
putting questions in there. I said, "Why are you doing penance for ... ?" He took it, he called&#13;
me up and he said, "I love this." He said, "I loved it. Come on up. Come on up." I went up,&#13;
and I got to-right away, we hit it off right away. He said, "This is the kind of stuff I like," he&#13;
said, "people talking straight to me."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "I'll talk straight to you."&#13;
&#13;
And so he said, "I hope you're going to Copenhagen."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Yeah, I'll be there. I'll be there, but I'm not going to be with you."&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "I hope not."&#13;
&#13;
As it turned out, they had to take him to the Bella Center from his hotel in a Hertz rent-a-truck.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Oh, really?&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes. They would not-they couldn't have limousines or anything.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: A limousine would have been a dead giveaway.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, they were taking him out the backdoor and everything.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                        Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                   June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 15&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So I go to Copenhagen with Basil [G.] Kavalsky. Have you had him yet?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: No. No.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Oh, you've got to get Basil. Basil is fantastic. Basil is a South African Jew&#13;
who is brilliant, absolutely brilliant. And he's still-he's retired, but he's doing a lot of&#13;
consulting for the Bank. He is a marvelous man. He's gay. He's got a partner from Vietnam, I&#13;
think it is, anyway, and then he started his own antique store. I've been in communication&#13;
with-he's given me so much stuff. But there's a book called "The Frontlines of Development"&#13;
[Gill, Indermit S., and Todd Pugatch. At the Frontlines of Development: Reflections from the&#13;
World Bank. Washington, D.C.: The World Bank, 2005]. It was produced in 2005, and it has&#13;
interviews with country directors. It is one of the best things that I have read in a long time, and&#13;
Basil's is the best of all. And his anecdotes about what he was doing in Afghanistan and whatnot&#13;
are exquisite. Anyway, if you don't have Basil, you've got to get Basil. He's excellent. He's&#13;
done much more than I have.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Where is he located?&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: He's right here. He's in Rome right now.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: But he's resident in the D.C. area?&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, he's got a home in Georgetown and a house out in the Blue Ridge, near&#13;
Front Royal. I don't know where his antique store is. Maybe it's in Georgetown. I don't know&#13;
where it is. But he's a fantastic guy. And then eventually, he was my last boss. I mean, it'd&#13;
come all the way around. That's the way it works.&#13;
&#13;
So he and I and Soren [J.] Holm, who is a Danish economist from Denmark, the three of us went&#13;
on this little debating tour, and we would go to the University of Copenhagen. And we had just a&#13;
balL They were screaming and yelling. And good debates, I mean, really, really good debates.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And you're young to mid-30s, rather than 50 years old.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHOR..~:      Yes, yes, right.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: That makes a difference.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, absolutely. I was 33, 34. I think Basil was maybe 29. Soren was about&#13;
that. We were a little bit older than the students, but the professors were about our age, and they&#13;
were, you know, they were just equally vociferous against the World Bank and international&#13;
capitalism as their students. And so it was really a vibrant experience.&#13;
&#13;
Then, I remember one night going to-they always invite the people that attend these Annual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Meetings to all these fancy dinners and things. One night they had the Danish Ballet in one of&#13;
these great-have you been to Copenhagen, the walking streets?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: No, I don't know Copenhagen at all.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Near the Tivoli Gardens. Copenhagen is a fantastic city.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, we're walking on the side streets, and these are sort of narrow, and there's a big crowd,&#13;
women in their furs. Out of a side street come pouring these kids, screaming, with banners and&#13;
rocks and they're smashing windows. The cobblestones, they're picking them up and whacking&#13;
the Cartier windows and every imaginable thing. And these poor people are just petrified, and&#13;
they're racing, screaming off in every direction, and some of them were the same ones we were&#13;
debating. "Look over there, there's Hans." So we said to hell with it. We just sort of walked, as&#13;
long as they weren't harming us. That was quite an experience.&#13;
&#13;
After that, I said to-by this time, I was learning more about some of my soul mates and&#13;
connecting and talking to people and learning what they actually were doing and why they did&#13;
this. And I said to William, "You know, William, I've really got to get into the nuts and bolts of&#13;
this stuff."&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "Okay, well, I'll talk to Roger [A.] Chaufournier," who was the vice president for&#13;
West Africa in those days. Through William's intervention, I became a loan officer for Liberia&#13;
and Sierra Leone. This division included Liberia, Sierra Leone and Ghana. I became the loan&#13;
officer for Liberia and Sierra Leone. What that meant is that I had to go to those countries&#13;
regularly and begin to do the work of the Bank, start talking with ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: But still you're a resident in D.C.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Resident in D.C. And one ofthe people that I interacted with regularly at the&#13;
Ministry of Finance in Liberia was none other than Ellen Johnson-Sirleaf, who is now the&#13;
president of Liberia, the first woman president in Africa. Last weekend, she gave the&#13;
commencement address at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, where I live. So&#13;
this small world of ours.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I want to interrupt you here because you mentioned one thing. You mentioned&#13;
Soren Holm, which is a name that I was looking for but couldn't find.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: How did you happen to be looking for him?&#13;
&#13;
G:RATHWOL: Well, because I got a question from somebody saying: Ask Tom about his&#13;
involvement with staff organization in the early days.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHOR.J.~:    Oh, yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                               June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Because Soren Holm, apparently, was also involved in that.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: That's right. That's right. Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And there is at least the breeze around that he was sort of forced out ofthings at&#13;
the Bank because of that involvement.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: I don't know that that's true, but I wouldn't be a bit surprised about it. But there&#13;
were others of us that were involved in that, and it was not only-it was definitely Soren and&#13;
myself but also Ian Burne. Do you know Ian?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: No.&#13;
&#13;
BL1[NKHORN: Ian became a director. He was the head of the office in Warsaw. He is now&#13;
retired. I've been in communications with him about this book. He and his wife, Muriel, live up&#13;
here in Northwest. But he was involved.&#13;
&#13;
Frank Stubenitsky from the Netherlands, who went on to IFC[International Finance Corporation]&#13;
and is now doing other things. He lives in Rotterdam, I think. So we were the ringleaders.&#13;
&#13;
The way it happened is that we had an organization early on, and it grew out of this Copenhagen&#13;
debate thing.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I see. Okay.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: I forget who actually started it, but it was called the 5:30 Club, and it was all of&#13;
the Young Professionals and young people who had come into the Bank and were confronted&#13;
with this ferment externally about capitalism and its role and what the Bank was doing, and was&#13;
the Bank morally doing the right thing, and were we following a model of capitalism that was&#13;
wrong or correct or what. And so there was a lot of questioning within the organization among&#13;
the young people that were coming in, And so we had a group that we formed informally called&#13;
the 5:30 Club, and we would meet twice a month in one of the offices up here, and 5:30 was, it&#13;
would be after work.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I see, thus the name.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: We would invite-! got McNamara to come. Munir [P.] Benjenk came. We&#13;
would get all of the senior people, and we would really go after them. Another very active&#13;
member of that was Montek Singh Ahluwalia. Montek Ahluwalia became the finance minister&#13;
for India, and he is now a big shot in international trade. He is the head of the Indian Planning&#13;
Commission. He and his wife are great economists, but Montek was a fiery debater. Kate&#13;
[Katherine H. M.] Mortimer was a YP [Young Professional]. She was the daughter ofthe&#13;
Bishop of Exeter. And she was into it. And myself, Ian Burne, and we had so much fun. And&#13;
we would have these things, and then we would go out and play tennis and get drunk.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                              18&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So this was about the sort of intellectual and moral underpinnings of the Bank's&#13;
business.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Exactly, yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Not so much about staff-labor relations.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: No, no. That came later.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay, that's interesting.&#13;
&#13;
BL1[NKHORN: That's very interesting. The way it was provoked, I'll tell you about it, because&#13;
there was perceived injustice in the Print Shop, and that was what got us riled up.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: That's howit shifted over to staffrights.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: That's how it shifted over. We were-there was an intellectual study group.&#13;
As a matter of fact, my second wife, Katherine Marshall-! don't know whether you want to use&#13;
this or not, but in any event, what happened was I was serving as a chair ofthe 5:30 Group for a&#13;
while. We would take turns. There would be little notes passed around. At the time, she was&#13;
working-she had been up to Princeton at the Woodrow Wilson School. And she came here and&#13;
she was working for Bob [Robert E.] Wieczorowski, who at the time was the United States&#13;
Executive Director. That individual always comes from the United States Treasury. He had&#13;
hired Katherine to be his special assistant. So she was working in that office. And she came to&#13;
this 5:30 Club, and I looked up and I saw this beautiful woman come in. And I said, "Holy God,&#13;
who's that?"&#13;
&#13;
And someone said, "Oh, that's Katherine Marshall from the U.S. ED's office."&#13;
&#13;
I went up to her and I said, "I'm Tom Blinkhorn."&#13;
&#13;
And she said, "Am I permitted to be here?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, are you a staff member?"&#13;
&#13;
And she said, "No, I work for the-yes, I am."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Where do you work?"&#13;
&#13;
She said, "U.S .... "&#13;
&#13;
I said, "You're not a staff member. You can't come here. I'm sorry, you have to leave."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                               June 16,17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                19&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And she just turned red, and I was teasing her. I said, "No, I'm sorry. I'm just kidding with&#13;
you."&#13;
&#13;
She said, "You son of a bitch."&#13;
&#13;
And that was the beginning there.&#13;
&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Anyway, so, let's see.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So there was something going on in the Print Shop, you said.&#13;
&#13;
BL1lNKHORN: What was going on in the Print Shop was that there was the head ofthe Print&#13;
Shop who was really treating a lot of the workers-and I think a lot of them were illegally here.&#13;
There were a lot of Latinos, Hispanic Americans-Hispanics in there. They were being forced&#13;
to do overtime and work very long hours. According to them, they were mistreated. They were&#13;
not given opportunity to-ifthey complained, they were fired, and it was really kind of messy.&#13;
And there was a lot of work going on in those days because McNamara was quadrupling lending.&#13;
&#13;
So we got wind of it, and I asked a friend of mine who-and this gets into the riverblindness&#13;
story because he helped me on this--can you find out about this and what it is?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: What? Oh, what's going on in the Print Shop.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: What's going on in the Print Shop. Because he was from Chile. His name is&#13;
Jaime Martin, and he had friends there that I knew about. He was a technician. He was a guy&#13;
that did what you're doing now. He did interviews and things like that. He was sort of a&#13;
technician. Not what you're-he was not doing the archives or a historian or anything, but he&#13;
helped fix machines and things. And he did a little investigating, and he came back and said,&#13;
"Yeah, it's even worse than you think it is."&#13;
&#13;
So I said, "Well, we've got to do something about this."&#13;
&#13;
So I was talking to Soren, and he said, "Well, these guys apparently have written a letter.&#13;
They've gone to see Hugh [B.] Ripman"--who was the head of the Administration Departm~nt,"&#13;
and I think Reg [Reginald A.] Clarke was still-maybe Reg was the deputy to Ray--"and nothing&#13;
happens. They've written a letter, nothing happens. And this is going on for months."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, Christ, you know, they'd better go see McNamara."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "\Veil, you know, we ought to be forming a society. If they don't listen to these people,&#13;
then they will listen to us."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                  June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  So we started talking about the idea of a Staff Association to make sure that there is equity and&#13;
  fairness of employment within the World Bank, and that's where it started. McNamara got wind~&#13;
  of this and invited three people from the Print Shop to come up and talk to Â· and he was liv!~&#13;
. I think he              rid of whoever it was. Don't hold me to that.                            ~5&#13;
                                                  The next thing, McNamara was ordering Reg        ~~&#13;
  Clarke, going, "You've got to fix this, and fiX: it fast."                                        B~&#13;
&#13;
Meanwhile, we were organizing the Staff Association. McNamara knew about it, and I told him&#13;
about it. He said, "Well, fine, go ahead. Whatever." But there were a lot of the officials in the&#13;
Bank that did not like this at all, and they were very upset with it. I think that-Soren was&#13;
definitely very, very out front with this. Jim [James] Chaffey, who eventually became head of&#13;
the Staff Association was extremely active. He's now dead.&#13;
&#13;
But there may be truth to that rumor that Soren was eased out. He was more academic, really. I&#13;
mean, I felt that he--and I think he's told me. He and I used to play tennis a lot. He told me that&#13;
he preferred the academic life. He was an econometrician in Berkeley and then went back to the&#13;
University of Odense in Copenhagen.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: When I Googled him, it looks like his career is academic.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, definitely.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And the relationship to the Bank was not immediately evident. That's why I&#13;
was curious about all of this.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: He left-he didn't stay around very long. And I often wondered whether, in&#13;
fact, he was pushed out. That may be true.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Well, it may be that his interests simply led him in a different direction.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Well, I know that that was true.&#13;
&#13;
G.RATHWOL: But there may have been some encouragement as well.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, right. I visited him in Odense many years later, and he's still a great guy.&#13;
But he never-he was very happy in what he was doing. He married and so forth and so on.&#13;
&#13;
I was involved in the creation of the organization. I was on the first-on the council, but I&#13;
started getting much more involved in development work in Africa. That came about, I was&#13;
the-as I was saying, the loan officer for Liberia and Sierra Leone, and eventually went to work&#13;
on Ghana. During that period, McNamara and his wife, Maggie [Margaret Craig], went to&#13;
Burkina Faso one time ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Then Upper Volta.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                 June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     21&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Then Upper Volta, right-and met this French entomologist, Rene Le Berre,&#13;
who had been working in the area for 20 years on this disease called onchocerciasis, or&#13;
riverblindness. Rene Le Berre is a very, very charming Breton, red-faced, the beard, and very&#13;
funny. And he just captivated McNamara and his wife, and told them the story of onchocerciasis&#13;
and the female black fly and all the rest.&#13;
&#13;
And McNamara was enchanted and said, "Why isn't anyone doing anything about this? Because&#13;
it's an impediment to development in these villages. These people are blind."&#13;
&#13;
Le Berre said, "Well, because the World Health Organization doesn't have any money, and&#13;
they're too bureaucratic."&#13;
&#13;
So McNamara then took the bull by the horns and decided the World Bank was going to get into&#13;
the health field, and that was the first-that was the first intervention in the health field. It really&#13;
created a lot of problems for him with the Board [of executive Directors] because they felt that&#13;
the mandate for health issues was the World Health Organization. But, you know, just like&#13;
[James D.] Wolfensohn later on with culture, that was another big blow-up with the Board.&#13;
McNamara, this is what he's going to do, and that's what happened.&#13;
&#13;
So I may not have got my timing on this right. I'll have to refresh my memory, whether I was&#13;
working as a loan officer, or whether I was at the end of my career with William and the External&#13;
Relations Department. But in any event, what happened was there was a meeting of people&#13;
interested in what the Bank should be doing in this field. William asked me what I thought, and&#13;
I said, "Well, you know, one of the best ways to demonstrate and educate people about this is to&#13;
do a movie or a video because you can show people in villages with blindness and little kids&#13;
leading them around, and it's very powerful."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Okay, you go do it, and I'll get you the money to do it."&#13;
&#13;
So I hired a team, a cameraman from New York, Jaime Martin, the Chilean guy who did the&#13;
radio work, and we went out and made a-went all over the villages of the Volta Basin. We&#13;
went to Geneva, we went to Paris, and everything, and put together a 28-minute video called A&#13;
Plague Upon the Land. We showed itto McNamara and [J.] Burke Knapp and the whole&#13;
management team. MeN amara insisted the entire management team come to the Eugene R.&#13;
Black Auditorium t0 see the first movie by inside the Bank. And he loved it. He just loved it.&#13;
&#13;
When I look back at it-and I use it in my lectures in Dartmouth now-it's pretty pedestrian. It's&#13;
not that good. But there's some damn good shots of these villages up close. I don't know if&#13;
you've ever seen it. It's 28 minutes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I think I have.&#13;
&#13;
You know, I interviewed Bruce Benton.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 BLINKHORN: Oh, did you?&#13;
&#13;
 GRATHWOL: For the Banlc&#13;
&#13;
 BLINKHORN: Oh, yes, yes. Well, you know, he used to work for Katherine Marshall.&#13;
&#13;
 GRATHWOL: Oh, really?&#13;
&#13;
 BLINKHORN: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
 GRATHWOL: That, I didn't know.&#13;
&#13;
 BLlNKHORN: In fact, Katherine Marshall, who by then-let's see, were we married? No. I&#13;
 think we were just--by then-Lois didn't like living here. She went back to Milwaukee. I got&#13;
 involved with Katherine, got divorced from Lois, and then Katherine and I married. But&#13;
 Katherine was with me in Paris. And she was the one that came up with the title A Plague Upon&#13;
 the Land. And then later on in her career, she was actually in charge of the riverblindness&#13;
 program. She was the one that hired Bruce Benton.&#13;
&#13;
 GRATHWOL: Yes. It starts in about 1980, I think, or so.&#13;
&#13;
 BLllNKHORN: Yes, right.&#13;
&#13;
 GRATHWOL: A very interesting interview with him. You would probably be-because you&#13;
 were involved at the outset.&#13;
&#13;
 BLINKHORN: Well, he was involved with it a lot more. than I was because he was really&#13;
 deeply involved. I did the film, and then helped to do some of the initial voice-overs into other&#13;
 languages, which helped raise $150 million for the first phase.&#13;
&#13;
 GRATHWOL: I was going to ask you about the fundraising because that was a big part of the&#13;
 purpose.&#13;
&#13;
  BLINKHORN: Yes, it was. The main purpose ofthe film was to be able to demonstrate the&#13;
  severity of the disease and why it was an impediment to development in this part of Africa. And&#13;
  it helped the Board to become a little bit more comfortable with the idea of the Bank getting&#13;
  involved in this. And in addition, it helped raise the money because those people are mainly&#13;
Â· Muslim. And that film had a tremendous impact in Kuwait and in Saudi Arabia and the Arab&#13;
  states. And they came up with a lot of money for that first phase ..&#13;
&#13;
 GRATH\VOL: That's very interesting.&#13;
&#13;
 BLINKHORN: .. largely because of the Muslim populations in Mali, Niger, and Burkina&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
Faso-Upper Volta, as it was. And that's where it was endemic.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: That's very interesting. I hadn't been aware of that, the religious and cultural&#13;
connection.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes. Let's see, I went back later, after a couple ofyears, to update that film and&#13;
discovered that one of the interesting aspects of that intervention, in addition to eradicating that&#13;
disease in the first phase, which was quite successful, but other things happened. Merck came in&#13;
with a new drug called ivermectin. Whereas, in the early days, we were using helicopters-they&#13;
were using helicopters to hit the breeding places, first, with DDT, and then they went from DDT&#13;
to a biodegradable compound.&#13;
&#13;
The other interesting angle on that was that the institution-building aspect of that effort was&#13;
extraordinary. It put in place Africans and African leaders who otherwise would not have had&#13;
the opportunity. And they run that thing. Imean, they basically run that.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And it's a sort of grounds-up organization.&#13;
&#13;
BLJ[NKHORN: Yes, exactly. Yes, it's very interesting from that perspective as well as health.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes, I found it's really quite fascinating.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHOR~:        Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So at this point, you're moving out of the-you're moving into programs.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, I'm definitely moving into programs. I'm getting away from the Staff&#13;
Association and all of that stuff. I started it, but I ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And the PR side.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: And the PR side of things, which I always felt was-I mean, I know that it's&#13;
important for the Bank to be able to help educate people about its work, but I really felt&#13;
uncomfortable in doing PR, because as a journalist you're always suspicious of PR people.&#13;
&#13;
G:RATHWOL: I wanted to ask you about that because there is a tension there, it seems to me.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: That was the other angle on this. It was not only the-I'm glad you asked that&#13;
because, although the bureaucracy and the vetting of the writing and the-that was very&#13;
infl1riating. But the other thing that was nagging at me, nagging all the time, I don't want to be a&#13;
"flack" for an institution.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: A spin doctor.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 24&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHO&amp;.~:        Yes. And that line is very, very difficult because, for example, when we were&#13;
debating with the students, there were some points on which I thought the students were correct,&#13;
but I could not publicly say that without jeopardizing the institution and having a front-page&#13;
article that says an official of the World Bank agrees with us, you know?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: So it's a very, very difficult-and I didn't like being in that position at all&#13;
because I was not telling the truth, and I didn't like that.&#13;
&#13;
GRI\THWOL: There is a fundamental tension between your role as reporter, where your job is&#13;
to get the story out ..&#13;
&#13;
BLlNKHORN: Yes. Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: .. and your role as a representative of an institution ..&#13;
&#13;
BL1lNKHORN: Exactly, yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: .. where you want a certain message going out.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes. Yes. So I was very happy to get away from that kind of a tension. Now,&#13;
I found other kinds of tension in dealing with countries and individuals, but it was a more&#13;
acc,;!ptable kind of a tension. I was learning how to deal with other people. I was working for an&#13;
objective that I believe was important, and that was very gratifying, if I could come out the other&#13;
end of that with something successful.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So we've gotten you up to the mid '70s, and you're involved, first, in West&#13;
Africa.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, and then what happened is that I had-and this is the way things&#13;
happened. I had another friend whom I knew through Katherine because he had gone to the&#13;
Woodrow \Vilson School with her. His name was Sven Burmester. Do you know Sven?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: No, I know the name from your little profile.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHOR..~:      You should interview him. He's an extraordinary guy, another Dane. He was&#13;
involved in a very interesting thing called the Hash House Harriers. He used to run all the time;&#13;
another Bank organization. Anyway, he was one of McNamara's special assistants. McNamara,&#13;
as you may recall from your doing this, he, as did George [D.] Woods before him, picked usually&#13;
a Young Professional to come up and work in the president's office and travel with them and get&#13;
to learn the Bank. It was just an extraordinary job. So Rainer [B.] Steckhan was with Woods,&#13;
and he was the transition to McNamara. And then after McNamara, Leif [E.] Christoffersen&#13;
became the special assistant to-and then, let's see, it was Sven Burmester, then Olivier&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                               June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    25&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Lafourcade, and then Caio [K.] Koch-Weser, all these people were special assistants up there.&#13;
And they had a great time, and they still are very close to McNamara, and they go and see him&#13;
all the time.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, Sven and I got to know each other through Katherine. He's a marvelous guy. We liked&#13;
each other. He knew that I knew McNamara, and so we had sort of a good friendship. So when&#13;
he left McNamara's office, he became the program's division chief for Sudan, Somalia, and&#13;
Ethiopia [Eastern Africa Country Programs Department II, Division 2B]. One day he called me&#13;
and he said, "Do you want a change?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "What are you doing?"&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Why don't you come on over and work with me on Sudan?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Great."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Corne on."&#13;
&#13;
So I did.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Before we move you across the continent, I want to ask you a question about-&#13;
there was a considerable drought in the Sahel through the late '60s and '70s. Did that impinge on&#13;
your work at all?&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, it did. Yes, it did, because the drought compounded the problem ofthe&#13;
dis~~ase, and it made it more difficult for people to not only get the water they needed-they had&#13;
to go longer distances-but in order to irrigate their crops. They were starving. So it was-I&#13;
was working in the Volta River Basin, and so on the tributaries ofthe Black and the White&#13;
V oltas you could see all of this.&#13;
&#13;
Now, when you're in the middle of this, the poverty is so pervasive and so appalling that it's&#13;
difficult-well, first of all, it had-I mean, it was part of my education. I mean, just to go out&#13;
into these villages and live in those villages with all these poor people, was just-it would just&#13;
knock you out. It's difficult to distinguish-and it took us a while to distinguish between who&#13;
was actually affected by the drought, who was being affected by other kinds of diseases-of&#13;
which there are lots-and where does riverblindness fit into this? So it was a very complex&#13;
equation.&#13;
&#13;
And the way that we got to that part of it was through the doctors, like Le Berre and others from&#13;
the World Health Organization, who would point out the discoloration of the skin and would take&#13;
biopsies of the skin and show these worms.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: The worms, yes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                26&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: And then you would have nodules on the bodies, and then, of course, the&#13;
culmination would be the blindness. And you would have middle-aged people totally blind.&#13;
&#13;
So those symptoms were brought to our attention. But these people also had other diseases, and&#13;
they also were very, very hungry, and their women ... But the amazing thing is how kind they&#13;
were and how open they were. I mean, I, for the first time, coming from being, you know,&#13;
coming from a white society, basically, I was in the minority in a black society, and I was never&#13;
treated with such kindness and honesty and civility in my life. I mean, these people will give&#13;
you anything, and they're happy, smiling, you know. Chiefs would go out and embrace you. It&#13;
was amazing. Amazing people.&#13;
&#13;
To come back to your question, I don't know. It just made the problem worse.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BLl[NKHORN: Yes, we certainly weren't doing anything extraordinary in the Bank in those&#13;
days to deal with that kind of problem, like we do today, when there's a big earthquake or a&#13;
drought or whatever. Like Bob, the new president [Robert B. Zoellick] is really responding to&#13;
this current crisis, this global crisis of food shortages and food spikes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes, this is still fairly early in McNamara's tenure.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, right.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: The push towards poverty comes with McNamara.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, that's right. The big speech in 1973, in Nairobi, in which he really came&#13;
out and said, you know, that the traditional theories of development-the trickle-down theory-&#13;
is defunct. It's not working, never has worked, and never will. We have to have strategic&#13;
interventions, in addition to growth. Growth is essential. The phrase that was always used is&#13;
"necessary but not sufficient." The Bank uses that all the time. "Necessary but not sufficient."&#13;
Growth was essential and necessary, but you have to also target. You have to go in, and you&#13;
have to educate kids. You have to make sure that women are-their health is taken care of, and&#13;
that is the critical strategic development, is the woman and the children. Get that done through&#13;
health and education, then you are doing something. It took us a long time to come to that&#13;
conclusion.&#13;
&#13;
G~:.ATHWOL: So you've worked in West Africa. You've concentrated on the riverblindness&#13;
program, really getting it started.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Getting the film done, and getting the money raised.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, right.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Are you involved then in the mechanics of going further with it?&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: No, I didn't do that because they were setting up a new apparatus to deal with&#13;
that, a new group of health people. And they were hiring health specialists, and they wanted to&#13;
make sure that this intervention was done with the bona fides of specialized people, plus done by&#13;
the people working in the Sahel. I was working actually elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
GRA.THWOL: I see.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: I got involved, after I did the film, with the Kpong project-K-p-o-n-g-&#13;
project on the Volta River in Ghana. I was the loan officer for that. I also-that was a big hydro&#13;
project on the Volta River. The big issue at that time was the bauxite smelter in the Volta&#13;
project. What was the name of the company that had this? [Volta Aluminum Company-Valco]&#13;
This was originally Kaiser Aluminum, and there was a big controversy involving the price of&#13;
electricity. There's a story here that I should tell you about.  -&#13;
&#13;
When Eisenhower was president of the United States, he invited the Ghanaian ambassador, who&#13;
at the time was based in New York, to come to have lunch at the White House. He drove from&#13;
New York to Washington, and on the way stopped at a Howard Johnson's in Wilmington,&#13;
Delaware. Do you know the story?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: No, but I can see what's coming.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: And they refused to serve him. No, he was not invited by Eisenhower. That's&#13;
wrong. He was coming to Washington for another reason, and they wouldn't-it hit the front&#13;
pages. Eisenhower invited him to the White House for lunch and apologized and said to him,&#13;
"What can the United States do to help your country?"&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "Well, we have this tremendous river that runs through our country and that&#13;
generates electricity. And what we want to do is use the electricity to create aluminum. And&#13;
there's a scheme that Henry Kaiser has developed to take bauxite from Jamaica, bring it across&#13;
the ocean, turn it-whatever they do." Is it bauxite that they ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: It's bauxite, and it's in clay, as I recall.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, and they bring it in, and they have to turn it ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And they have to smelt it.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Smelt it, yes. And the cheap electricity was the energy source for that, and that&#13;
would create jobs, and blah, blah, blah. And Eisenhower said, "Okay, we'll look into that."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                               June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                28&#13;
&#13;
So nothing happened. And then when Kennedy became president, he phoned-! guess it was&#13;
George Woods-and said, "Whatever happened to that project?" He said, "I want that project&#13;
going." And he convened a meeting and got that thing going. And the result of it was a big dam&#13;
called Akosombo, way up on the Volta River.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: How do you spell that?&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: A-k-o-s-o-m-b-o. And the Bank financed that, or helped get it going. That was&#13;
the first one, and it resulted in that smelter coming to Tema, near the big port.&#13;
&#13;
The Kpong project--K-p-o-n-g-was right down below Akosombo and was going to generate&#13;
even more electricity. But it got involved with the whole price of electricity because by this time&#13;
the Ghanaians were seeing they were getting ripped off. And so we were getting involved to&#13;
help broker, trying to compromise between Kaiser and the Ghanaian government on this. I was&#13;
working on that.&#13;
&#13;
I was also, at that time, working on a-forgive me. I may have the timing wrong on this-but a&#13;
very interesting project in Lofa County in Northern Liberia, one of the first rural development&#13;
projects. That's also an interesting story because Leif Christoffersen, who had been McNamara's&#13;
assistant, by this time had become the division chief. I was his-Â·I was working for him. I had&#13;
read a book by Graham Greene called Journey Without Maps. It was written in 1936. And&#13;
Greene was based in Freetown, Sierra Leone. One of his first novels was based in that setting, in&#13;
Freetown. There was a spy novel. And he actually was working for MI6. During World War II,&#13;
he was the MI6 representative in Freetown, pretended to be a writer. He was writing, but he was&#13;
also watching German ships because right next to-in that area was Togo, and Togo used to be&#13;
German. And so he would file reports back about German transports moving.&#13;
&#13;
On the other side of the continent, another British writer by the name of Malcolm Muggeridge,&#13;
who has written some great books called Chronicles of Wasted Time. Fabulous, funny books.&#13;
Malcolm Muggeridge was the MI6 representative in Mozambique, and he was watching&#13;
transport into another former German colony, which is now Tanzania. It used to be called&#13;
Tanganyika. So the stories are these-and I was absolutely intrigued with Greene. I loved&#13;
Greene.&#13;
&#13;
When I read that book, that Journey Without Maps, which he went to the end of the train line and&#13;
actually walked all the way from the end of the train line, in Kenema, Sierra Leone, up into Lofa&#13;
County in Liberia, and all the way back down to Monrovia. And so Leif and I decided we would&#13;
take the same trip, and we took it in a Land Rover. We went all the way up to Lofa County,&#13;
where this project was, a rural development project, and we came all the way back down.&#13;
&#13;
So, in those days, we would present the project to the Board. The loan officers would take all the&#13;
questions and actually be the advocates for the project within the bureaucracy and sort of&#13;
organize it. The rates of return, we would have to go with Abe [Abraham A.] Raizen, and he&#13;
would be questioning us, or the technical aspects. I would bring one of the agriculturists with&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                29&#13;
&#13;
me, and we would have to defend ourselves within the Bank. Then, we would have to defend&#13;
ourselves before the Board, and the Board would be asking questions. And before the Board,&#13;
there was a lot of preparation to do that because we didn't want to muck up.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Right.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: McNamara was great, anyway. I mean, he would read everything. But this&#13;
particular day, I was presenting the Lofa County project, and I decided I was going to do the&#13;
Graham Greene trick. And so I got this speech together, and I started out my speech, and I'll&#13;
never forget it. "In 1936, the British novelist Graham Greene walked-gentlemen, I said&#13;
'walked,'" and I made it very dramatic. I said, "And he walked 1,000"-and McNamara is&#13;
sitting there, and he's just beaming. And then I said, "We walked"-we didn't walk, we took&#13;
the--"and I'll tell you not much has changed in Lofa County in the last 50 years. The people are&#13;
poor, and this project is going to help change their lives." Bang. McNamara got-he said, "Isn't&#13;
this Board happy we have a journalist as a loan officer?"&#13;
&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
BLlNKHORN: He called me up afterwards, and he said, "That was great." He said, "Just keep&#13;
it up." He would do stufflike that. He was so inspirational.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: A little bit of flair.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Oh, yes, I loved it. I loved it. But later on, in the Narmada project, oh, God. I&#13;
got so nervous in that one. I was holding this pointer. It was shaking. And Ernie started this,&#13;
"Blinkhorn, do you want me to hold your hand?"&#13;
&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: That's a part of the later story.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, yes, exactly. Yes. Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay. So ...&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: So Sven [Burmester] calls me, and he says, "Do you want to come over? Do&#13;
you want a change, and work on Sudan?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Absolutely. Sure, I want to work with you." And so I changed, and I went over to East&#13;
Africa, and I worked with Sven Burmester. I was the loan officer for Sudan, and I went all over&#13;
Sudan. Djuba, way out to Darfur, where all the stuff is going on now. But the big thing that I&#13;
got involved with then was a project in which we were trying to revive, or resuscitate, the cotton-&#13;
growing schemes on the White and the Blue Niles near Khartoum. And that was a big project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                30&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Now, this is also the time that Aswan is going up.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Well, Aswan had been up. Aswan was actually built earlier, in the '60s, but the&#13;
impact of Aswan was being felt all the way down. And there was a treaty between Egypt and&#13;
Sudan and Ethiopia on the use of those waters. And that figured into the cotton-growing&#13;
schemes because it had to do with how much water could go out to irrigate those schemes. So&#13;
there was a lot of very interesting international waters activity involving lawyers to make sure&#13;
that what we were doing was consistent with international treaties.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to that, there was another Danish character, Gunnar Sorbo, who was an&#13;
anthropologist, who had written a book [Sorbo, Gunnar M. How to Survive Development: The&#13;
Story of New Haifa. Khartoum: Development Studies and Research Centre, Faculty of&#13;
Economic &amp; Social Studies, University ofKhartoum, Monograph series, no. 6, 1977] about the&#13;
people, the Nubians from the Aswan Dam, who had been relocated to New Halfa. New Halfa&#13;
was a place in Sudan, where when they put the-the dam created by the Aswan Dam inundated&#13;
all their-and they were forcibly moved. So the whole issue of what you do with the riparian&#13;
rights and the people affected by this, this also figured into our scheme. It came back to haunt&#13;
me again in Narmada, in India, years later. It was not as much of an issue at that stage, but&#13;
Gurmar Sorbo had written the book. He lived with the Nubians, and he knew the language, and&#13;
so he was someone that we brought in later on.&#13;
&#13;
The person who comes now into my life at this stage is someone that you will know. His name&#13;
is J.. [Jayasankar] Shivakumar.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Again, that's a name I looked for and didn't find. You have to tell me about&#13;
Shivakumar.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Shivakumar is an Indian, who was in the Indian Foreign Service, a very, very&#13;
smart man from Tamil Nadu. He is the president of The 1818 Society. I am going to have lunch&#13;
with him on Wednesday. I was in charge-I-by this time, he was new to the Bank. He was in&#13;
the Agricultural Division [Northern Agriculture Division, Eastern Africa Projects Department],&#13;
working on Sudan, and he was brand new. Because I knew the Bank and I had been a long-I&#13;
was asked to be the project leader for, even though I was on the program side, for this project.&#13;
&#13;
I took a team out to-the initial team-out to do the appraisal of the cotton-growing schemes. I&#13;
forget the exact name of it. Shivakumar was the agriculturist on that team, along with Sherif&#13;
[Omar] Hassan, who is a lawyer, and Gregory [M. R.] Wiratunga, from-he was the&#13;
disbursement officer. And we had just a ball. And those guys became friends of mine for life.&#13;
&#13;
One of the great things about the Bank, you make enemies and you meet people that you just&#13;
don't get along, but I would say 90 percent of the people that I have worked with over the years, I&#13;
can write a note to them. I haven't seen them in 20 years, and they come right back. It's just that&#13;
sense. I feel that they are my friends, and I think they feel the same way. It's an amazing thing&#13;
to have that.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   31&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Shivakumar is that way. He is the one that called me, and when I heard that they were going to&#13;
do this book [Blinkhorn, Thomas A., ed. The Memory Book- World Bank Stories and&#13;
Revelations. The 1818 Society 30th Anniversary Publication, October 22, 2008]. I said, "You&#13;
know, this is something that I'd like to work on."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Okay, you take over."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Okay, I will." So that's the way it works.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, he was on the mission. It was rough because we were trying to get the price paid to the&#13;
cotton growers increased, to increase the incentives. The government didn't want to do it. So&#13;
there was a lot ofto-ing and fro-ing. In addition, we had a problem with the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: The IMF [International Monetary Fund]?&#13;
&#13;
BLJ[NKHORN: Yes. This happens a lot, or has happened a lot in the past, where the Fund, as a&#13;
way ofhelping a country to stabilize its economy if it has a balance of payments problem, will&#13;
typically go in and say, "Okay, your inflation is too high. You've got to cut the budget. You've&#13;
got to do such and such and such and such in order to deflate. And we don't care where you cut,&#13;
just cut."&#13;
&#13;
Well, in actual fact, we care where they cut. If they're going to cut the budget, and if the money&#13;
that we want to go to those cotton growers is cut, then we can't make it work. So we get into this&#13;
big argument with the Fund: "You have to allow for the agriculture."&#13;
&#13;
"Well, if we do it for them, then we'll have to do it"-that kind of thing.&#13;
&#13;
That has happened in Argentina, Brazil, and all this tension between the Bank and the Fund.&#13;
&#13;
G:RATHWOL: And it's more complicated in the '70s because of the spikes in oil prices.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Exactly, yes. Absolutely.&#13;
&#13;
GP.ATHWOL: In '73, Yom Kippur.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GH.ATHWOL: The '79 revolution in Iran.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: That's right, yes.&#13;
&#13;
In any event, Shivakumar's father died when we were out there in the field, and he felt terrible&#13;
because this was his first Bank mission. He was trying to make an impression on the Bank and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16,17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                         32&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
his boss and everything else. And he says, "I don't know what to do."&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Just go home. Just go back." And he really appreciated that. I said, "I'll cover for&#13;
you." And he went back.&#13;
&#13;
Then, he came back, and I forget all the-anyway, he took over the project, and I was doing&#13;
something else.&#13;
&#13;
But, let's see, I forget now where we are. I was mainly working on that, but doing a lot of other&#13;
things in Sudan. Nothing of-just normal business, as I recall. Willi [A.] Wapenhans was the&#13;
vice president [Eastern Africa Region] in those days, Shawki Farag was the-he's an Egyptian&#13;
who was in the resident mission. Khartoum was the old British colonial city. There were still&#13;
people around who remembered when the Pan American-those big flying ships would-well,&#13;
there were people who knew that they would go from Heathrow or Gatwick to Malta, to&#13;
Alexandria, to-I forget the place in the Nile-and then Khartoum, and they would just keep&#13;
going all the way down to Cape Town. That's the way they did it.&#13;
&#13;
They flew from London to Cape Town. It maybe took them 2 weeks, but they were sleeping&#13;
onboard. I remember when they used to tell me the stories. And they were seaplanes. They had&#13;
these big pontoons on them, and they would come into the Nile, and the people would come out&#13;
from the hotel and row out in boats and come in and they would have their, you know, grand&#13;
meals, you know, just stay for a few days and then fly out. It was a great way to travel. I just&#13;
remember old-timers-Swearingen [sp?] was his name. He was in the British Foreign Service-&#13;
just going on about how it used to be. I just loved that part of the ...&#13;
&#13;
Tht:: interesting thing to me, as sort of an observer, a journalist, is the pattern of hiring in those&#13;
days.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Within the Bank now?&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: In the Bank. We had a lot in Africa, where I was working, had a lot of the&#13;
former colonial people, who had been in the British Colonial Service. And then when all the&#13;
African countries started becoming independent in the late '60s, they found themselves out of&#13;
jobs. And they ended up in the World Bank, a lot of them. And so we had a lot ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: These are mostly whites.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Mostly whites. Hardly any blacks. I only know of one Ugandan, in those days,&#13;
that was hired, [Zerubaberi] Birgirwenkya, and he only got in because he was a big shot in one of&#13;
the staff colleges in Kampala. But most of them were-and the interesting thing to me, and we&#13;
used to have a lot of tension about this--is that a lot of these people did not like the fact that they&#13;
were no longer in charge. So they would go back to their former colonies-Nigeria, Sierra&#13;
Leone-and start acting as if they were still in charge. I remember the fights I used to get in&#13;
with some of these guys about the way they treated them, and the way they would, you know,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                       Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                  June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  33&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
talk to them: "Oh, God, this is terrible." And they'd just sort of dismiss me: "We know these&#13;
countries. You don't know anything."&#13;
&#13;
So, let's see. Where are we going now?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So you're still resident in D.C.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, I always was resident in D.C. I never lived over there. I mean, I spent a&#13;
lot of time, but I never ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL; Yes, you did a lot of traveling.&#13;
&#13;
BL1lNKHORN: Yes, but I never-and I stayed for a couple of months sometimes, but I always&#13;
lived in D.C.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes, okay.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: So, by this time I'm married to Katherine, and she is working in-she became a&#13;
Young Professional after she left the ED's office, and she didn't know whether she wanted to&#13;
become a Young Professional. She felt that she should be hired straight on, but there was a little&#13;
struggle, and then finally did that. And then she worked in Bangladesh in education and&#13;
eventually ended up in an agricultural division in East Africa, which created an interesting&#13;
conflict because-not-well, on the surface it did because there was no rule then. I don't know&#13;
what the rule is now. But a husband and wife, or a spouse, or whatever in the same area was not&#13;
right.&#13;
&#13;
So the way that we got around it-and I think it's still true today-if you are working for a&#13;
different director, even though you may be under the same vice president, if you were working&#13;
for a different director and you're not passing on each other's performance, then that's okay. And&#13;
I think that's what happened. Because she was working in the Agricultural Division [Central&#13;
Agriculture Division, Eastern Africa Projects Department], with Mike [Michael J.] Walden, and&#13;
she eventually became the division chief ofthat division. And I was working with Sven&#13;
Burmester in Sudan, and whatnot.&#13;
&#13;
But we traveled a lot. We had our daughter, Laura, was born in 1980. And from a:n early age, I&#13;
mean, she was three years old or four years old, and we were traveling with her in Madagascar.&#13;
One year we went to Lake Kivu and went to the Mountains of the Moon, and saw the gorillas,&#13;
and went with a couple of our friends from Denmark. We did a lot of traveling all over Africa&#13;
with our daughter, Laura, when she was just a little, little girl. And so she's had a lot-and then&#13;
she: eventually was a Peace Corps volunteer in Guinea.&#13;
&#13;
And then in '90, we had Patrick, who is now going to be a senior at Georgetown Day School.&#13;
But eventually, that marriage dissolved later on, which we can get to, I think, in another session.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                  34&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You moved from Africa to Asia in the late '70s.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Well, there was an interregnum there. Did I mention that?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I don't have it down.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Okay. Let me just tell you what happened there.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: In the mid '80s, I'm still working-let's see, when did I go to become a division&#13;
chief?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You have senior loan officer, East Africa, '79 to '82 is what I have.&#13;
&#13;
BLJ[NKHORN: Now, in '83, what happened was that I was-was it '83? I guess it-I'll have to&#13;
think through this. But anyway, I think it's '83. I was approached by Frank [R.] Vogl, who was&#13;
the new Director of External Relations under A. W. [Alden Winship "Tom"] Clausen. Clausen&#13;
was McNamara's successor.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Right.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: And he had heard that I used to be a journalist, and he said, "Would you like to&#13;
come back to External Relations?"&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "No, I'm not going back there. I had enough of that. I want to stay in Operations."&#13;
&#13;
So he said, "Okay." So then he looked around, and he came back to me again. He said, "Would&#13;
you consider coming over if you got a promotion?"&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "I would consider it on the condition that it's a term, just a"-the understanding&#13;
would be that I stay there for no more than three to five years. I forget what the number was.&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "Okay, let's do it. I'll fix that."&#13;
&#13;
So he gave me a promotion, and I took it and went over to start something called the Public&#13;
Affairs Division in External Relations. And my responsibility was to cover all the developing&#13;
countries and plus work on North America. I was given a sort of wide-open ticket to hire people.&#13;
&#13;
GFtATHWOL: This is quite a different assignment. It's 4:00. I think I'm going to stop here.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Right. Good.&#13;

GRATHWOL: This is June 17th, 2008, a second oral history session with Thomas Blinkhorn,&#13;
conducted by Robert P. Grathwol, for the World Bank Group Archives Oral History Program.&#13;
&#13;
Tom, we talked yesterday about many things. I wonder if, in between times, anything has&#13;
occurred to you that you want to add to the record ofthat session?&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Several things did occur to me. They were mainly personal things, and the&#13;
transitions of my life having to do with my family and my wives, and stuff like that. But there&#13;
was one incident that was just brought to my memory by Shivakumar, whom I was just talking to&#13;
a few minutes ago. He mentioned that in 1976 a filmwas made about the Bank, and I was&#13;
explaining and acting as a loan officer and what does a loan officer do. I had been in the Bank, I&#13;
guess, a few years. All of the details are not very clear to me, but Shivakumar remembers this as&#13;
here's a journalist acting as a loan officer and doing quite a good job at saying what a loan officer&#13;
is supposed to do.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: So that we got a big kick out of that. There were a couple of other things&#13;
having to do with our work together in Sudan. Well, yes, there is one. This comes back,&#13;
actually, into the next phase, as we get into-and that is, one of my-I mentioned earlier that I&#13;
had traveled all over the country, to Darfur and whatnot. One of my most interesting exploits&#13;
was to go all the way to the South to a city called Djuba, which is the capital of Southern Sudan.&#13;
Southern Sudan is largely African. Northern Sudan is largely Islamic, and there's been a long&#13;
traditional animosity between the two.&#13;
&#13;
[Interruption]&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay. Continue.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: At any rate, I went down to this place called Djuba, the capital of Southern&#13;
Sudan. I'll never forget going into the famous Djuba Hotel one evening-very, very hot. There&#13;
was one light dangling from the ceiling in the main entrance, and the place was full of insects&#13;
and animals. I forget whom I was with at the time, but we checked in. It was late. We did not&#13;
have very much food, and so we were able to get some water. And then we said, "What's on the&#13;
menu for dinner?&#13;
&#13;
And we were told, ''Well, we don't have any food. All the food is gone. The Army took all the&#13;
food, but we do have a chicken in the backyard."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, let's cook the chicken."&#13;
&#13;
And the chef went out, and we were chasing the chicken around the backyard, chopped its head&#13;
off and ate that chicken for supper. And I hadn't done that since I was kid in Cape Breton, when&#13;
my grandmother, who used to have all these chickens-I'll never forget as a little boy&#13;
watching-you've heard the phrase "chicken with its head cut off"?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BL][NKHORN: It's like that, as you probably know yourself.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I do.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: And then the whole process of getting the feathers out. That was quite an&#13;
expenence.&#13;
&#13;
And that then came back again later on in the next episode, when I hired a very interesting man&#13;
from Southern Sudan and Northern Uganda-well, Southern Sudan, Dunstan Wai, W-a-i. As a&#13;
matter of fact, today, I ran into a friend of mine, Daniel Ritchie, who was going to a meeting of&#13;
the board of the Dunstan Wai Memorial Foundation, which was set up by a lot of Dunstan's&#13;
friends to help educate orphan girls mainly, in Southern Sudan and Northern Uganda. And Dan&#13;
and Kim [Edward V. K.] Jaycox, a former vice president for Eastern Africa, are very active on&#13;
the board. Both were going to the meeting, and they had been very good about raising money for&#13;
this and whatnot. But I actually, I was the one that hired Dunstan to come and work, and I'll tell&#13;
you about that in a minute.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay. There were a couple of things that came to my mind after yesterday's&#13;
session. We broke off just at the end of the '70s, before you began with the Public Affairs&#13;
Office.&#13;
&#13;
Onoe ofthe things that occurred to me were, we mentioned the spikes in oil prices, but we never&#13;
got around, or I never brought up one of the issues that certainly, economically and&#13;
internationally, is a major issue in that period, and that is the U.S. abandonment of the gold&#13;
standard and the sort of crumbling of the Bretton Woods monetary system. Did that impinge at&#13;
all on your operations?&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: No, it didn't at all. It didn't at all. It had more effect on the International&#13;
Monetary Fund than it did on the World Bank. That's not to say that in countries with balance-&#13;
of-payments problems that had denominated their currencies against the gold standard, that there&#13;
were not dislocations. But I think that the Fund-and that's their job is to help countries through&#13;
those periods-it had an impact on them more than it did on the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Okay. Well, I was curious about that because it's a major change in post-World&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
War II alignment ..&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, it's a major change. Right. Exactly.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: .. and economic alignment.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Sure. Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: We concluded yesterday just at the beginning of the new phase of your&#13;
involvement with the Bank, your return to Public Affairs.&#13;
&#13;
BL1lNKHORN: Yes. I was hired by the then-director who had been brought in. He was The&#13;
Times of London Washington correspondent, the head of their office here. His name is Frank&#13;
Vogl-V-o-g-1. Frank had been a reporter in the United Kingdom, and then he was posted here&#13;
for The Times of London. In one of his assignments he had, he was writing for the business&#13;
section of The Times of London for the weekend, he actually went to interview A.W. Tom&#13;
Clausen-C-l-a-u-s-e-n-in San Francisco, where he was the chairman of the Bank of America,&#13;
or president. It was quite a long interview, and I think that Clausen thought that it was well&#13;
done. That had been done several years earlier.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I see, before Clausen's appointment.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Right. So when Clausen was named to replace Bob McNamara, and he was&#13;
looking around for a director of Information and Public Affairs, in actual fact, the story is that&#13;
Frank Vogl wanted the job and actually went out to San Francisco to make the case for getting&#13;
the job with Clausen, and he actually got it.&#13;
&#13;
So Frank Vogl comes to the Bank and learns that I used to be a journalist. Then he asked me if I&#13;
would come over and head up a new Public Affairs Division in External Relations. And I said,&#13;
"No, I'm very happy where I am, and I prefer the operational side of the Bank, in any event."&#13;
&#13;
So, then, he came back to me and he said, "Well, would you consider coming if you got a&#13;
promotion?"&#13;
&#13;
And I said, "Maybe." And I said, "Well, ifl get a promotion and the agreement is that I go back&#13;
to Operations after no more than four to five years, that's the limit, then I will take the job." That&#13;
was actually put onto my personnel file, that these are the arrangements under which I would go&#13;
on leave from operational work.&#13;
&#13;
He wanted me because I had journalism experience, and also because I knew the Bank and he&#13;
didn't. He had reported on the Bank, but he had never known it from the inside.&#13;
&#13;
My responsibility was to head up a division that was to develop a strategy for what the Bank&#13;
ought to be doing in External Relations in the developing countries, as well as in North America.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                 June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    39&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So it was a big job. I had a pretty good budget, and I was given an opportunity to hire people.&#13;
So I started hiring people. I hired Judy [Judith A.] Maguire, who became our congressional&#13;
liaison person. She eventually worked with a former congressman from Cleveland, Bill&#13;
[William J.] Stanton. He eventually came on, I think it was in the later days of Clausen because&#13;
the Bank had always had the need for someone close to the president who could advise the&#13;
president about relationships on the Hill. It was very important. Not that McNamara needed&#13;
that, but the subsequent presidents did need that.&#13;
&#13;
So Judy Maguire, who is now retired, she was working with the Hill. And then I had other staff.&#13;
Shelley [Sheldon] Rappaport--Gene [Eugene H.] Rotberg was the treasurer then, and he&#13;
suggested someone from the financial area that he thought would be good to help on that side of&#13;
it, so he encouraged me to hire Shelley Rappaport. I did. I hired several other people. I hired&#13;
Jack Hamilton, John Maxwell Hamilton. There's a story about that I'll tell you in a minute. He&#13;
was at USAID [United States Agency for International Development], working as an assistant to&#13;
the administrator for Asia, Jack [John H.] Sullivan. So I was doing this sort of thing, hiring staff&#13;
and at the same time trying to figure out what should this part of the Bank be doing with respect&#13;
to explaining the Bank and trying to develop a stronger understanding for what I was trying to&#13;
do.&#13;
&#13;
I mentioned earlier the tension between being a journalist and a banker. Now this got me into a&#13;
different kind of challenge and a different kind of tension, which had to do with my very strong&#13;
reservation not to lie about the foibles of the Bank, to try always to tell the truth. But I felt that&#13;
my job was primarily to try to educate, to inform-to inform-a variety of audiences-not only&#13;
the media, a variety of audiences about the role of the World Bank and what issues it was trying&#13;
to grapple with, and then through that information process, to develop a better understanding and&#13;
support for the mission of the institution. I didn't regard my job as to spin, and I really resented&#13;
any attempt for spinning. If that was to be done, it was going to be done by Frank V ogl, and I&#13;
told him that. This eventually came to haunt me, but that was the understanding.&#13;
&#13;
So, on those things, I made this very clear to the staff working for me. This is the way we want&#13;
to work. My deputy was an Indian, Sundrum Sankaran. I better start jotting down some things&#13;
here as we go along because this is provoking ideas for this other book that I'm doing.&#13;
&#13;
Then one of the people I got-well, here's the way it started. One of the big challenges for the&#13;
Bank in those days, as now, is what do we do about Africa. I mean, this is the real problem with&#13;
poverty. There are more people who are really poor in India and China than all of Africa, of&#13;
course, but the African problem was just as paramount then as it is now. So I felt that my job&#13;
was to try to develop a specific strategy for Africa, not only because I thought the Bank needed&#13;
it, but mainly because I also had experience in Africa. I had been in Africa. I had come out of it,&#13;
and I felt that I could make a contribution based on what I knew.&#13;
&#13;
So one of the first things I did is propose that we do a survey, a quick and dirty kind of survey of&#13;
what do key constituencies of the Bank know about the Bank, how do they get their information,&#13;
what do they do with that information, and what should we be thinking about as an institution in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 40&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
starting to think through how can we improve the work that we do in Africa.&#13;
&#13;
So I got the budget to do it, and then I went out and started looking for consultants. I found a&#13;
British guy, whose name escapes me now, but he had lived in Africa, he wrote in Africa. He did&#13;
a lotofwork as a journalist in Africa and had tremendous contacts. So he was one person.&#13;
&#13;
Then I needed to get an African. I forget who mentioned Dunstan Wai, but Dunstan Wai was a&#13;
kid from Southern Sudan, from a very poor village in Southern Sudan, who had done well&#13;
academically and found himself being educated at Harvard, in public policy, and at Oxford. He&#13;
was teaching-! think it was either at Princeton or somewhere else-and doing a lot of academic&#13;
writing and whatnot. I read a lot of what he was doing, and I said this guy is potenti&lt;:dly very&#13;
potent. So I called him and invited him down for an interview, and we struck it up very, very&#13;
well. He was great.&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Would you be interested in doing this, taking six months off and going off with this other&#13;
guy and doing this?"&#13;
&#13;
"Absolutely."&#13;
&#13;
So we put terms of reference together, and these two went around and did it.&#13;
The:y came back, and then what we did was put together a big report on whatthe strategy of the&#13;
Bank ought to be in Africa to deal with misunderstandings and whatnot. Now, that's a big, big&#13;
job because Africa is a big, big place. But we were selective. We're not going to cover the entire&#13;
continent.&#13;
&#13;
Oh,. the other reason: the guy knew French, and that was very, very important, too, because we&#13;
were covering French and English.&#13;
&#13;
So that report became the basis for a very, very active discussion within the organization because&#13;
I figured that the only way that we, a small department in External Relations, would ever be&#13;
successful is if we mobilized the operational staff, the people doing the work, to regard what we&#13;
were doing as important to help them in the institution; that if we were to operate the way that&#13;
External Relations had done in the past, which is we are the mouthpiece for the president, and we&#13;
will get out the press releases, if we operated that way, our effectiveness would be very, very&#13;
limited. But if we were able to mobilize good, thoughtful, credible people who could speak and&#13;
think and talk in the operational complex and use them as our collaborators, then we would&#13;
maximize our potential and our effectiveness.&#13;
&#13;
So I convinced Vogl that we should go around to all of the division meetings and talk to them&#13;
about why this was important, we need your help, could you designate someone to be blah, blah,&#13;
blah, blah. There was a lot of hostility to it, a lot of hostility. They'd go, "We've got enough to&#13;
do." But there were a lot of people who said, "Yes, this is important."&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Was the hostility directed at the idea or that you were coming from Public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  41&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Affairs?&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Both. It was mainly because we were coming from Public Affairs and because&#13;
most of them felt, well, we were spin doctors. But because I had been in Operations, particularly&#13;
in Africa, they knew that I was not a spin doctor because I knew just as much as they did by this&#13;
time.&#13;
&#13;
So, in the Africa Region particularly, there was much more acceptance. Plus, I was by this time&#13;
married to a Bank staff member who was a division chief, and she has had a lot of credibility and&#13;
acceptance. A lot of people in the Bank, you know: "Well, maybe they're serious about it this&#13;
time." So that helped.&#13;
&#13;
But there was some hostility because, well, you know: "That's your job. Why should I do it?&#13;
And furthermore, I don't want to talk to the press anyway, and I certainly don't want to go out&#13;
and give speeches be~ause I've got appraisal reports to do."&#13;
&#13;
I can understand that. But my point was,"Listen, if you are passing through Europe or Nairobi&#13;
and there's an opportunity for you to talk to some students, would you consider this? It's not&#13;
taking a lot of time, and we'll help you. We'll brief you." So that eventually helped.&#13;
&#13;
The: Africa report by Dunstan Wai and this other guy then was the focus of a big discussion&#13;
within the African Region of what we were doing, what we were going to do. It was so powerful&#13;
that one day I got a call from Kim Jaycox, and he said to me, "I need Dunstan Wai to work with&#13;
me." He said, "He's got tremendous credibility in Africa. He's a black African. He's come from&#13;
a"--and he said, "I really do need him. I'm the new vice president."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "I can't turn you down, Kim, but I'm going to call. I'm going to come back again." So I&#13;
lost Dunstan after a while.&#13;
&#13;
But it was one ofthe more interesting things I did when I was in that job, along with trying to&#13;
mobilize the assistance of the operational staff and the financial staff in outreach: "This is your&#13;
institution. You have an obligation to try to explain and help it because support for it is&#13;
extremely necessary if we're going to continue to serve and do our mission effectively." That&#13;
was the mantra.&#13;
&#13;
It was much more than just press conferences, much more than just answering-because we had&#13;
sort of a war room: Peter Riddleberger and Tim [Timothy W. B.] Cullen, others, who were&#13;
assigned to take urgent calls from journalists on everything. We had a good line. Peter&#13;
Ricldleberger used it regularly with great effect: Even the most idiotic question from the most&#13;
hostile press representative, always respond, "That is a very interesting question. It's a serious&#13;
question. It deserves a serious answer. We'll get back to you," and don't leave it hanging for&#13;
more than 24 hours. Get back fast. Then we have to figure out how to answer that damn thing.&#13;
So I thought that worked.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16,17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    42&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The other thing that I did during that period that I thought was very helpful, I hired this guy Jack&#13;
Hamilton, John Maxwell Hamilton, who had been an assistant to Jack Sullivan in USAID. He&#13;
also went to Marquette, so there's a connection here. He had been in the Marines, a lieutenant in&#13;
Vietnam and whatnot, and he was a very good writer. So I hired him to work on special projects.&#13;
We didn't know what that meant, but he came up with an idea that I bought immediately. His&#13;
idea was: would it be possible to go to Main Street America-Main Street America being main&#13;
streets in small towns in Minnesota and whatnot-and find out what do they know about-we're&#13;
always talking about globalization; we're always talking about how the world is becoming&#13;
interconnected. Is it really? Is it truly that way? In Anniston, Alabama, is it like that? Is it like&#13;
that in Waterloo, Iowa? So how is this affecting their lives?&#13;
&#13;
So I said, "Okay, let's do it, but why don't we do it in a way that in the first phase you will go to a&#13;
select few small communities." We deliberately wanted to get Main Street; small, but close to a&#13;
good newspaper that was interested in working with you and assigning reporters to do the kind of&#13;
investigative work that we think needs to be done, and also close to a journalism school so that it&#13;
can be part of a wider education effort and association.&#13;
&#13;
So the first phase we went to my old friend from the Nieman program, Brandy Ayers, whose&#13;
family owned the-A-y-e-r-s-H. Brandt Ayers family owns The Anniston [Alabama] Star. We&#13;
started kicking it around. Brandy immediately jumped, and he said, "It's great." He said, "Tell&#13;
Jack to come on down and start working right away." It was that kind of thing.&#13;
&#13;
Jack-I don't know, I think he actually eventually went to a town in Mississippi-Greenville,&#13;
Mississippi, maybe-where Hodding Carter was. Anyway, he eventually picked out, after&#13;
working with the Association ofNewspaper Editors and whatnot, he got four or five small&#13;
towns; one in Illinois, one in Alabama, one in Oregon, sort of regionally dispersed, good, local&#13;
newspapers, and he started his work. He was gone for-we let him go for about nine months.&#13;
&#13;
He came up with a series of stories that just knock your socks off, I mean really good stuff, about&#13;
how schools were accepting-high schools-were accepting people from Korea and whatnot.&#13;
That had changed. There was nothing that they had ever seen like that. And then the whole&#13;
commerce and the exchange between these small towns and how they were selling things in&#13;
other parts of the world, and how they were just thirsty for knowledge about it. These&#13;
newspapers used this stuff on the front page, on Sundays. We made it into a book, Main Street&#13;
America and the Third World, by John Maxwell Hamilton [Cabin John, MD: Seven Locks&#13;
Press, c1986]. It was really good.&#13;
&#13;
NPR [National Public Radio] picked it up. Jack was on NPR. He was asked to go and talk to&#13;
journalism schools all over the place.&#13;
&#13;
Then, the next phase of that was to go to the-he learned, for example, in the pine forests of&#13;
Mississippi, they were actually selling pine tar to a company in southern China for doing&#13;
something, and then making it and selling it back. There were all of these kinds of connections.&#13;
And how the telephone company in such and such, a small Illinois-had-it was the beginning&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                 June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    43&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
of outsourcing. Your telephone book in Minneapolis was now being produced in a small, little&#13;
suburb of Manila. So he went to all of these places, and he got the other side of it, and started&#13;
reporting on that. Then he did a second book, a sequel to it [Hamilton, John Maxwell, Nancy&#13;
Morrison and Erlinda Bolido. Entangling Alliances: How the Third World Shapes Our Lives,&#13;
Seven Locks Press, 1990]. It was great. This was happening in the late '70s, early '80s.&#13;
&#13;
But Vogl was not really impressed by all of this. There were a lot of accolades for this, but he&#13;
felt-there was a lot of problems with IDA [International Development Association]. There was&#13;
a lot of disenchantment in the Bank about Tom Clausen's leadership. He was mainly a banker, a&#13;
financial person. He didn't have the kind of missionary zeal that Bob MeN amara had for poverty&#13;
and alleviation of poverty. The only other person that had it was Jim Wolfensohn. They really,&#13;
truly believed that that's the mission of the Bank, and that really inspired the Bank in a way that&#13;
other presidents did not.&#13;
&#13;
So Clausen was sort of regarded as a banker. He, I don't think, really adapted to the culture of&#13;
the institution as quickly as he might. He may not have believed that, I don't know. I just&#13;
thought he was nondescript.&#13;
&#13;
I think Vogl picked up on that. He had a good relationship with Clausen, and I think they felt the&#13;
need was to give him a better image, within and without. That was Vogl's primary&#13;
responsibility. It happened at a time when IDA was getting into trouble. They needed to be&#13;
supported. So he kept coming to me and would say, "Give me all the names of all the journalists&#13;
that you know from Harvard," blah, blah, blah, "so I can go and tell them that they have to write&#13;
things."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Frank, come on. Are you crazy? You mean I am supposed to go to my friends and say,&#13;
'Write something positive?' I'm not going to do that. I'm simply not going to." It was that kind&#13;
of, "Well, why can't we have them at dinner and then you will sit there"-it was just stupid kind&#13;
of stuff, as far as I was concerned.&#13;
&#13;
So he and I started getting on the wrong side of each other. He knew that these projects that I&#13;
was doing with Dunstan Wai and Jack Hamilton and whatnot were good, but it was not what he&#13;
wanted. He was under the gun. He was under a lot of pressure. He started really getting a lot&#13;
of-I remember the vice president for Latin America, A. David Knox, really did not like V ogl or&#13;
the operation at all. He was very, very upset with the way it was being handled. He would tell&#13;
me that, frankly, about it. Ernie [Ernest] Stern was basically running the Bank, and he didn't&#13;
particularly like Frank Vogl.&#13;
&#13;
So I found myself sort of caught again, you know. It was a question not so much of me needing&#13;
to spin, but my belief that what I was trying to do was help to inform a wide variety of audiences&#13;
in many different parts of the world about what we were trying to do-or the issues-in the hope&#13;
that that would develop understanding and, at the same time, retaining my credibility with my&#13;
colleagues in Operations because I was trying to convince them to do the same thing. That was&#13;
different from enhancing Clausen's image, or that was different from trying to convince some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    44&#13;
&#13;
congressman or staff on the Hill that they should support IDA. I didn't particularly want to do&#13;
that. I didn't think that was the way I was hired. So I caught myself in a different kind of&#13;
conflict, different from the one that I had when I first came to the Bank, a little bit the same, but&#13;
it's different. It was a tension.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: It sounds like two elements are going on here. One is a clash between your&#13;
interests in long-term promotion with the Bank ..&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: .. and Vogl's need for short-term promotion of Clausen.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: You've caught it very well.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: But the other strikes me as-you said something very interesting yesterday, and&#13;
I don't know if it's on tape so I want to repeat it. You said, "When I took this position, I was no&#13;
longer a journalist."&#13;
&#13;
BLlNKHORN: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: It sounds to me as though that tension you felt as a journalist between your job&#13;
to expose the story and your job for the Bank to promote a certain image of the story had, in a&#13;
sense, dissolved, but the different tension was you were now a missionary on behalf of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, yes, yes. Exactly.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: And you weren't being allowed to do what you thought was important.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, yes, yes. I think you've caught it very well. Yes, that's exactly it. I had&#13;
gotten over my guilt at having betrayed my true belief. I always felt guilty that I had really&#13;
betrayed my pursuit of the truth.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: The journalistic calling.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes. The mantra, when I was a young journalist, was you've got to pursue&#13;
truth in order to make you free. I mean, I really believe that. That was sort of out of the Catholic&#13;
tradition as well. So I had that guilt, but I was over that. Because what helped me was the&#13;
realization, as I practiced the Operations side, was this is God's work we're doing, actually. This&#13;
is actually God's work, helping poor people. Then I could grasp onto that truth. That saved me a&#13;
little bit, you see.&#13;
&#13;
Meanwhile, my personal life is going all kind of crazy. Here is a good Irish Catholic boy who&#13;
used to serve mass, in Latin, of all things ..&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes, I remember it well.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: .. getting divorced and all that. So that's going on here. So I'm betraying my&#13;
Catholic faith. So I was in a lot of turmoil. I don't know how I survived. I think the blarney or&#13;
the humor may have helped me.&#13;
&#13;
So after about three years of this, it was not-and I started losing my-I knew that Frank Vogl&#13;
was a good journalist, but I realized soon that he was not as good a journalist as I thought he was.&#13;
So we really started coming to blows and arguing. He was always writing memos: You will do&#13;
this.. And I would ignore him.&#13;
&#13;
So 1 finally said to Ernie-Ernie Stern-one day, "I've got to get out of here-the Bank." By&#13;
this time I had known Ernie, and 1 said to Frank, "I took this job with the understanding I would&#13;
go back. 1 don't know that you and I are going to be able to make this work. I'll try the best I&#13;
can, but there are certain things I can't do, and I think you know what they are." It was that kind&#13;
of thing.&#13;
&#13;
The tension was starting to reflect on the staff. I mean, my staff knew that V ogl and I were not&#13;
getting along. It was concerning to them because they were also interested in careers, and they&#13;
also wanted to do-you know, they had families and things, and they didn't want their boss&#13;
constantly fighting with the director. That doesn't help anyone. So it was not a good situation.&#13;
&#13;
So, finally, we worked out a deal that I wanted to keep my division chieflevel and move into&#13;
Operations as a division chief, but there was no-that was not going to be done. So, I forget, one&#13;
of the many reorganizations, they created a position called senior program officer. W. David&#13;
Hopper was then the vice president for South Asia, a Canadian. David and I got to know each&#13;
other, and he liked the fact that I was a Canadian. There were not that many of us.&#13;
&#13;
So 1 was asked if I would be interested in the senior programming officer position in India,&#13;
working under, first, Russ [Russell J.] Cheetham, who was the director for India, and then later,&#13;
Bilsel [H.] Alisbah, a Turkish guy. There would be no--I mean, I would keep my salary and my&#13;
grade level and all the rest. So there was no detriment on that front, but it was just that the title&#13;
was not what I had hoped it would be because titles mean a lot in this organization, and also the&#13;
ability to hire people and have my own budget, ;;tnd that wasn't going to be, at that particular&#13;
time. So I took it, mainly to get out of Public Affairs but also to take on a new challenge, which&#13;
was very exciting. That was to work on the India program, which is the biggest in the Bank,&#13;
working in a new country, new culture, and everything. So I was excited by that.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Before you go on to that, I want to ask you a couple of questions about that stint&#13;
in Public Affairs.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: It seems clear that you were not involved, from what you've said, in defending&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                 June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                46&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the Bank's positions on things like structural adjustments or ...&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: But you were close enough to observe how that was being done.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Do you have any comments about that? There are some very big issues in that&#13;
period.&#13;
&#13;
BL1lNKHORN: I think that the way that it was handled, mainly, is that we relied very, very&#13;
heavily on the operational people to provide the inputs for press releases or counterattack&#13;
documents that were required in order to defend what the Bank was doing, and it took many&#13;
difÂ£erent forms. What happened there was that my staff was divided according to Regions.&#13;
&#13;
We had a Peruvian by the name of Ciro Garnarra, and he was the public affairs officer&#13;
responsible for Latin America. So what we would do on Polonoroeste, for example, is that he&#13;
would work with the division chief and the project people and try to help develop responses to&#13;
inquiries that were corning out of both the Latino press, or groups, or nongovernmental&#13;
organizations, as well as those in Latin America, and he would work with David Knox on that as&#13;
well.&#13;
&#13;
On structural adjustment, that I forget who was actually handling those kinds of things, but it was&#13;
mainly with the chief economist's office, and I forget who the chief economist was at the time,&#13;
but the structural adjustment work was fairly pervasive. So I think each of the Regions-! mean,&#13;
we had Ciro Garnarra, we had Fawzi Rihane in North Africa. Dunstan was our man in Africa for&#13;
a while before Kim picked him up. I forget who I replaced him with. But each one of the&#13;
Regions had a public affairs officer who would work and try to get that out.&#13;
&#13;
My job, at that stage, on those kinds of things, was mainly to make sure that our work was done&#13;
in a timely manner and making sure that it was correct and that sort of thing. There was no spin.&#13;
Now, there were legitimate differences of opinion about the efficacy of structural adjustment and&#13;
the Bank's and the Fund's role. That, in retrospect, was not handled very well by the Bank, and&#13;
not designed properly by the Bank. There were a lot of critiques, a lot of criticisms of that&#13;
eventually. I think that was borne out in the fullness of time that these kinds of initiatives may&#13;
not have been thought through properly.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: One of the changes that took place-you've alluded to Clausen's lack of interest&#13;
in the poverty mission that McNamara had set out for the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Right.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: But also, underneath that, you had a change in the economic thinking at the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16,17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      47&#13;
&#13;
Bank from Hollis Chenery to Anne Krueger ..&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: That's right. Exactly. Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: .. who came in very much with a "Reaganist" point of view.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes. That's right, yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Is that something that you were affected by or that you perceived? How did&#13;
that work down to your level?&#13;
&#13;
BLllNKHORN: That actually was a source of tension, as I recall, because most ofthe people in&#13;
the Bank were, and are, I would say, liberal, progressive people who tended to be more&#13;
Democratic than Republican or conservative. Now, that's an oversimplification. But ifl think&#13;
back on the people who followed this very closely, like the Europeans and the others, they&#13;
clearly were to the left on those issues and felt that there was always a role for government, and&#13;
that you could not do this work for government and that, furthermore, the Bank is enjoined by its&#13;
Articles of Agreement to lend to governments, or with a government guarantee. So you could&#13;
talk all you wanted about how terrible governments were, but you had to deal with governments,&#13;
and had to try to change them, if possible.&#13;
&#13;
There was a tension, and there still is a tension, to some extent. But what was happening is, at&#13;
the higher level, the presidents, like Clausen and like Barber Conable, who was a liberal&#13;
Republican from New York and who had been brought in by [Ronald W.] Reagan-the story of&#13;
how those people came into the job is very interesting-they were putting pressure on the staff&#13;
and the management: Look, let's de-regulate. This is the new-and Anne Krueger represented&#13;
that too. She was of the belief that you had to let the market speak, let it flow. The evidence is&#13;
that when you do that, you have growth, and blah, blah, blah. So there was a big debate going on&#13;
inside the Bank. We were caught up in that, to a large extent.&#13;
&#13;
The interesting division was between the Americans and some of the Brits because Margaret&#13;
Thatcher was also there, and you had guys like [L.] Alan Winters, who was a very, very&#13;
conservative-and the Bank always made sure to cover its ass in the sense of getting the&#13;
conservative thinkers involved, in the tent, so that they couldn't accuse us of being totally left.&#13;
Now, there was legitimate debate here, and Winters is a very, very good economist. But that&#13;
ferment was going on.&#13;
&#13;
If you ask me how did it play out specifically in what I was doing, I don't think that it came&#13;
down to that level. I think it was mainly on a higher level. And it's interesting to me to look&#13;
back and see how it has changed because a few years later, when we started going into the&#13;
former Soviet Union and the whole thrust, ideological thrust, is that you had to downsize&#13;
government, you had to liberalize, you had to privatize these big industries, and blah, blah, blah.&#13;
And that's what we were doing in Ukraine and everywhere else, and look what's happening in&#13;
Russia today. Putin calls it state privatization. All of those big-that we thought were going to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                 June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                48&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
privatize, they're still state oligarchs. So it was very, very interesting.&#13;
&#13;
So I was happy to leave Public Affairs and go to India. But I discovered, very quickly, that no&#13;
one really knew what this job of senior-SCPO-senior country programming officer was really&#13;
to be about. The division chief was a, I think, a Filipino, Cosmas Linus Robless. A very, very&#13;
mce man.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, he said to me, "Okay, you are my representative. You've got to deal with all ofthese&#13;
project officers, and I expect you to keep on top of the program. We've got a huge program.&#13;
We've got $12 billion in debt that we have in India, and we have to make sure the India program&#13;
is moving. Your job is to make sure that we meet our lending targets every year, and that is IDA&#13;
and the Bank loan."&#13;
&#13;
I'll never forget, when I came to IDA-and this is where people like [William R.] Easterly are&#13;
partly correct. When it came to India, I'll never forget one day sitting in David Hopper's office,&#13;
and we were coming toward the middle ofthe fourth quarter. And we had targets for IDA&#13;
lending. Unless we got rid of that IDA money, we were faced with having to explain to our&#13;
donors why we failed to lend as much as we said we were going to lend. That would play back&#13;
into our ability to raise future IDA money. We were caught in a trap because we would tell the&#13;
donors we need, let's say, $10 billion and why. We said, "These are the reasons," and we'd lay it&#13;
out. It was very, very carefully done with models and everything else, and India was the largest&#13;
IDA borrower. If you did not meet that, then you started getting pushback, serious, from the&#13;
Brits, the Americans and everything else.&#13;
&#13;
So Ernie would call up David and say, "David, David, that power project, that power project, it's&#13;
only $600 million."&#13;
&#13;
And David would-and I was sitting right there-David said, "Ernie, I know. That's what we&#13;
appraised. That's what it is."&#13;
&#13;
He says, "Uh-uh. It's more than that. You've got to kick it up to a billion."&#13;
&#13;
It was that kind of conversation. Hopper had to kick it up, and he did. That's the way we were&#13;
moving money in those days. I didn't like that, either. I mean, I didn't like that. So I concluded&#13;
then that the real place of honor in the World Bank was on the Projects side. I had always been a&#13;
country loan officer, a Program-are you aware of the Programs-Projects thing? Are you&#13;
familiar?&#13;
&#13;
G.RATHWOL: It's a distinction that it's useful to draw.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: The way it works, if I can summarize it in a nutshell, is that you have the&#13;
Regional vice presidents for Operations. The Operations is the heart of the Bank. This is where&#13;
the action is. Finance is important, research is important, but this is the World Bank on the&#13;
frontlines, lending money and helping. So each of the Regions has its vice president, and then&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                 June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   49&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
you have your country directors, and then you have your Projects people that work on this. So&#13;
the drill is that you have a three- to five-year lending program, and it's based on conversations&#13;
and discussions with each of the governments. In the large countries, like India and China, they&#13;
have their own country director because they're too big. And the smaller countries, you have a&#13;
constellation of countries. Within that configuration, you would have pebple like me, the loan&#13;
officers, who would make sure that the plan was discussed and agreed with the ministry of&#13;
finance and others and that the donors, the Canadians and the Americans, would know about it.&#13;
We had consortium meetings, and our job was to keep the thing rolling.&#13;
&#13;
The actual work and deciding whether you would-once we decide, "Okay, we need roads, we&#13;
need this and that and that," and that's agreed with government, then the actual work to decide&#13;
how long is that road, how much is that going to cost, how are we going to pay for it, who is&#13;
going to be the institution maintaining that road, all those kinds of details were done by the&#13;
Projects people. And the Projects people could come back and say, "W~it a minute. You guys&#13;
are targeting $15 million, but we need $25 million for this and this. Otherwise those poor&#13;
farmers will ... " So they had a lot of power and a lot of information.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So the length of the road and the position ofthings is the Programs side.&#13;
&#13;
BLlNKHORN: No, the Programs side decides that, "Okay, we have $100 million for Mali, and&#13;
we're going to lend that over three years. And we've decided, in collaboration with the&#13;
government, that one-third will go into agriculture, one-third will go into education, and one-&#13;
third will go into infrastructure. That infrastructure can be roads, or it can be repair to the&#13;
airport, or whatnot."&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Or irrigation.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes. Now, Projects, you come in and work with your counterpart in&#13;
agriculture, and you come up one-third, $30 million. "You tell us where the priorities are. We&#13;
think it's rice, but we're not sure. Once you decide that, you tell us, and then you put the project&#13;
together, and then we'll have it approved." So Projects carries out what we have agreed. Now,&#13;
there may be midcourse corrections, but that's the way it worked.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Right.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: So, in the India case, the old aphorism that if you owe your banker a million&#13;
dollars, then you are beholden to your banker. But if you owe your banker $10 million, the&#13;
banker is in trouble. And that's the way it was with India because we had $12 billion in debt, and&#13;
there was no way that we were going to tell India that we're not going to lend to you. But we&#13;
could do that to Mali. We could do that to the smaller countries, but they'd never do it to India.&#13;
So that was in the background as well, you see.&#13;
&#13;
Ernie had worked in India for USAID. He was an old India hand. So India was the jewel in the&#13;
crown. I was very happy to be working on India because it was the place where there was a lot&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16,17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    50&#13;
&#13;
of action. But the role of the SCPO that I had been hired to do was trying to keep everything&#13;
moving along, be the orchestra maestro. I didn't like that because I had to say to Steve, "How&#13;
come you're not delivering that project?" And I didn't like doing that. It was not really getting&#13;
out into the country and doing the work.&#13;
&#13;
So I talked to the boss, and I said, "Listen, I'd like to move into Projects." So they assigned me&#13;
to the Agriculture [Agriculture Operations] Division, under Jan Wijnand-W-i-j-n-a-n-d. Jan&#13;
Wijnand was a Dutch Australian. He was born in Holland and lived in Australia. He became an&#13;
Australian citizen. He had replaced Olivier Lafourcade. Olivier is a Frenchman who had been&#13;
the Agricultural [Agriculture Operations] Division chief. When Jan took over-! knew Jan from&#13;
Africa, and so I told him, "Look, I'd like to work with you so I can get into the nuts and bolts&#13;
stuff."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Fine, come and join us." So I did. He said, "But I'm going to ask you to do something.&#13;
I'm going to ask you to take over the Narmada project."&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This was what year?&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: This was, it must have been in-no, let's see. When did I leave?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: '86 to '93, Senior Program ...&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, okay. This must have been '88, '89. It was not long after I joined. And&#13;
by this time, the explosion, the tremors were just beginning to be felt. Bilsel Alisbah was the&#13;
country director and Jan Wijnand was the Agricultural [Agriculture Operations] division chief.&#13;
&#13;
The Bank, incidentally-let me digress-had gone through several different reorganizations over&#13;
the years, in which Projects had been in command and then Programs were in command. And it&#13;
kept shifting back. There was this sort of-what do you call it?-this kind of creative tension&#13;
that McNamara always described as being very good for a large organization. I want creative&#13;
tension._ I want these guys battling with each other. Other people thought it was a waste of time&#13;
and money. So you will see, as you talk to people, that this competition between Programs and&#13;
Pr~jects was going on for a long time. I actually felt the real power is in Projects, and I still .&#13;
believe that.&#13;
&#13;
In any event, I got over in Agriculture and quickly discovered two things: one is that this project&#13;
was becoming a major problem project. To set the stage for you very quickly, India typically&#13;
had gone through large droughts. I remember I wrote a chapter of a book, in retrospect, and&#13;
quoted Lyndon Johnson giving a speech in Omaha, Nebraska, when he was president, and he&#13;
was saying to the audience, "Ladies and gentlemen, today you have read about the tremendous&#13;
famine in the largest democracy on Earth. This famine has occurred once every hundred years&#13;
because of the large numbers of people there, and because of the climate, the erratic rainfall, or&#13;
lack of it. You farmers here in Nebraska are helping to save a country. Today, 69,000 tons of&#13;
your wheat is going across, way out yonder," he said, "to help those poor, starving people."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 51&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
That's what he said. So this was a problem that India had always had.&#13;
&#13;
Now, India, by the time I got there, was beginning to feed itself, and it did it largely through&#13;
irrigation and through other macroeconomic policies and whatnot. But one of the big problems&#13;
was in the west. The west of India, in the state of Guj arat all the way up to the Rann of Kutch on&#13;
the border with Pakistan, was a semi-arid area, and large numbers of people who had great&#13;
difficulty in getting irrigation for, just water for themselves, for their animals, for crops. Yet&#13;
here was this big river, the fifth longest in India, the Narmada, flowing to the sea untouched,&#13;
from the Himalayas all through Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat right into the sea.&#13;
&#13;
So the scheme was, ever since the British were there-and [Jawaharlal] Nehru believed it-why&#13;
not tap that river? We can get hydro, we can irrigation, we can do this, we can do that and&#13;
everything, and the Bank thought it was a great idea and went ahead and started developing a&#13;
project. Jerry [Gerald W.] Fauss was the chief engineer, a marvelous engineer who had worked&#13;
on the big irrigation schemes in the west of the United States. He knew all of this stuff. He and&#13;
the engineers worked with the Indian engineers and put together a beautiful, beautiful project,&#13;
from an engineering standpoint.&#13;
&#13;
That project was approved. The Bank put in $300 million in the first phase to get it going. Japan&#13;
came in and financed the turbines. It was going to generate electricity, and it would go up into&#13;
Madhya Pradesh, which was desperate for electricity. But it would also create a lake behind the&#13;
dam. Here's the river, here's Gujarat, here's the dam. That river went like that. This lake would&#13;
come like this and inundate all these lands right in here, and there's where all the tribal peoples&#13;
were living, over 100,000. That soon became a bone of contention. When the nongovernmental&#13;
organizations around here realized that this project was going through, they started getting very&#13;
upset. In addition-this is the sea-the sediment from the river that went down here to feed the&#13;
fisheries down here was going to be blocked. So there was an environmental consequence.&#13;
&#13;
Now, in those days, we had environmental regulations in the Bank that said you had to look at&#13;
this and you had to find out what the risks were, and you had to mitigate the risks. If you look at&#13;
the documents, that was there, but it was not done very, very thoroughly or carefully because the&#13;
emphasis was on hydro, irrigation, engineering, and a good return for your investment. On those&#13;
counts, it was good, but on the others, it was weak. That was our folly.&#13;
&#13;
The NGOs, the nongovernmental organizations, led by a very, very vigorous lady by the name of&#13;
Medha Patkar-P-a-t-k-a-r, M-e-d-h-a-Medha Patkar, she started realizing-and this is in a&#13;
time when computers were starting to come in--you could communicate very easily across India&#13;
and across the world. So she started letting it be known to environmental organizations in the&#13;
United Kingdom and the United States that the World Bank was destroying large, large tracts of&#13;
very, very pristine property, and it was not only tribals, it was animals and everything else, and a&#13;
sacred religious-because this is a very religious region. The Ganges is religious-is sacred. So&#13;
is Narmada. This is even more sacred in Hindu, the religion. People would, for centuries, would&#13;
go up and be saved by going up and down and praying along the Narmada.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   52&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: That's very interesting because in the reading I've done on the Narmada, I&#13;
haven't found that religious component discussed.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Very important, extremely important. There are sites all along here where&#13;
people would camp and stay and pray, very, very important in Indian ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I may have missed it. But it's interesting that you draw it out as one of the&#13;
principal-certainly, in terms of public relations, that's a big issue.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Very powerful, very powerful. At the same time, a lot of people knew-who&#13;
wer~e hungry and thirsty-they knew that this held promise. But at the same time, it was one of&#13;
those public issues that you have both sides, you know. You find it in environment all the time,&#13;
like whether you should drill up in the Arctic.&#13;
&#13;
But this is starting to divide people. And Medha Patkar was very, very successful in mobilizing&#13;
people like Bruce Rich, the head of the Environmental Defense Fund, and Lori Udall, the niece&#13;
of Stewart Udall, the congressman, a very, very well-known congressman from Arizona.&#13;
Then-who is the very, very wealthy gentleman from the United Kingdom? Teddy Goldsmith.&#13;
He came from a very wealthy family, and he was involved. He had been against dams for a long&#13;
time. He got on the bandwagon. Pretty soon, these people were writing letters of protest to the&#13;
Bank and to the Congress and everything, saying you've got to stop Narmada.&#13;
&#13;
Here I am, going into a project in which I am trying to help complete this project and realizing&#13;
that there were some genuine issues here that had to be dealt with and that had not been dealt&#13;
with properly in the original project.&#13;
&#13;
So we came up with a second project, the Narmada Environmental Project. The purpose of this&#13;
project was to provide money to do a couple of things; to provide housing and alternative&#13;
income-generating activities for the people that were going to lose their lands because we had an&#13;
obligation to do that, not only morally but according to our Bank regulations, but in Indian law&#13;
there are provisions for doing that that were somehow overlooked. So the purpose of this new&#13;
project was to take care of that oversight and also to examine very, very carefully the impact&#13;
downstream of this dam on the flora and the fauna and the fisheries and what could be done to&#13;
mitigate that. So that was a brand-new project.&#13;
&#13;
Actually, I started mobilizing the team, Ridley Nelson and I. Ridley is still in the Operations&#13;
Evaluation Department. We put together and appraised the project-! forget the total amount of&#13;
it--we brought it into what was then "green cover." By the time we got it into "green cover,"&#13;
the shit was hitting the fan. It was really, really hot.&#13;
&#13;
The head of the India Department had changed. It was now Heinz V ergin-&#13;
V-e-r-g-i-n-German. Heinz had been working with Moeen [A.] Qureshi up in the financing&#13;
side. He didn't know India, but he knew the financing side of the Bank. He was brought in as&#13;
India country director. He walked into a maelstrom. I was working in Agriculture [Agriculture&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                               June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   53&#13;
&#13;
Operations], and he said, "You have got to come and be my special assistant. Let Ridley take&#13;
this project. I need you to be my environmental adviser because we're getting all kinds of other&#13;
stuff. We're being asked to pay more attention to environmental issues, and I want you to work&#13;
with the Ministry of Environment on a new environmental action plan, and also to help me&#13;
because you've got your background in communications. You know how to write, and I can't&#13;
because English is not my language. Work with me on this Narmada mess."&#13;
&#13;
So here I am now, I'm pulled up into the front office, and I'm basically working on two fronts.&#13;
I'm working on the environmental action plan in India. Forestry is a big issue there because&#13;
there are a lot of forests here, and part of the action plan is what are we going to do to save these&#13;
watersheds that are going to be inundated and whatnot.&#13;
&#13;
In 1990 I discovered a woman who was a forester and was working in Rajasthan on community&#13;
development for the Ford Foundation. Her name is Betsy McGean-M-c-G-e-a-n. And she is&#13;
now my wife. That's how I met her, in 1990, when she was working on Rajasthan and knew&#13;
mueh more about community, forestation, and tribals than I ever would. She's a Yale Forestry&#13;
School graduate. So I hired her to do some work. This is before we got involved romantically.&#13;
&#13;
So I was working on that front and then trying to figure out what to do with Narmada.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Now, all this time you were still located in Washington?&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Still ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You're not out in the field.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: But I'm spending lots oftime out there. I'm spending half my time out there&#13;
and half my time in Washington. And it became so bad that there were leaks in the Delhi office.&#13;
The Bank office was right in the middle of New Delhi, in this beautiful park. Of course, most of&#13;
the staff were Indian, but they, the NGOs, Mehda Patkar and all the rest, they knew exactly when&#13;
I was traveling. They knew when I was coming. They knew where I was staying. They knew&#13;
when I was going to go to the site, and they were always there to greet me. In addition, they&#13;
were mobilizing back here in Washington and London.&#13;
&#13;
I told you, I think, about me on the front page of The Times of India; did I tell you that?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: No, I don't think you have.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHOR~:        The first time they got us is I went up to Madhya Pradesh, in Bhopal. That's&#13;
the capital of Madhya Pradesh, the state of Madhya Pradesh. Madhya Pradesh is the state in&#13;
which most of the inundation was going to take place. Here's Gujarat, here's Maharashtra, and&#13;
this is Madhya Pradesh. So we had to go up into Madhya Pradesh. The formal name of this is&#13;
called the Sardar Sarovar Project. The shorthand is Narmada because ofthe river.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   54&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Right.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: There was supposed to be a second project up here, a bigger project up here,&#13;
Narmada Sardar, and it's supposed to be in Madhya Pradesh. But because of the heat of this one,&#13;
we decided to put this one on hold and to go with that environmental project that I was talking to&#13;
you about that Ridley and I were ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: So Sardar Sarovar got postponed.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Sardar Sarovar is the one right here. It was going ahead, but Narmada Sardar,&#13;
the one upstream, was put on hold. That was supposed to double the electricity output.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I see.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: And the inundation behind it would not have been as great as this because of&#13;
the configuration of the land and whatnot.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Right.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Anyway, I was going up here to Bhopal to deal with the chief minister, or the&#13;
chief secretary, and others about what we do about these projects. We had a seven o'clock&#13;
meeting, before the heat set in. I was coming out of the driveway in a car, and here's three&#13;
bus loads of protestors, led by Mehda Patkar. They surrounded the two cars, and they wouldn't&#13;
let us go. And we're standing there. My driver stupidly went down to pick up a tire jack, one of&#13;
those iron tire jacks to come out because they were shaking his car. He went up there, and he's&#13;
going like that. I said, "Get back in here quick." They just grabbed him and someone ripped off&#13;
one of the-it was starting to get really, really fierce. They started singing "We Shall&#13;
Overcome." They were marching around. I've always learned, I mean, from the 1968-keep&#13;
calm, keep smiling. Don't lose your cool, no matter how bad it gets. I just sat there and smiled.&#13;
&#13;
After about two hours, the chief secretary starts calling the hotel, "Where in the hell is Blinkhorn&#13;
and the World Bank team?" And they sent the Army. All of this is being filmed and&#13;
photographed and everything else. They sent in big trucks, and these people locked arms. They&#13;
had to just pick them up bodily and throw them in, and it was just terrible.&#13;
&#13;
Th{:n I got back to Delhi after that, and we went through our meetings, came back. As I'm going&#13;
into the World Bank office, another large group was there. And a small, poor old woman is&#13;
grabbing me by the sleeve, front page of The Times of India, "World Bank Official Gerhaoed."&#13;
G-e-r-h-a-o-e-d. It's an Indian, Old English world, meaning to surround. That's the headline.&#13;
I've: got the picture. I've got it on the wall of my office up in Hanover, and I'm going to put it in&#13;
this book right here.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, they were very effectively organized. The Bank was scrambling to try to figure out&#13;
what to do. Meanwhile, back here, Bruce Rich ofthe Environmental Defense Fund was very,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  55&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
very effective with Lori Udall. By this time, the Dutch was-Eveline Herfkens was the Dutch&#13;
representative to the Board, and she was getting heat from her NGOs. -The Nordic countries&#13;
were catching hell. So we figured, okay, what we'll do is instead of us explaining what this&#13;
project is all about, we will bring a delegation from India, and it will be headed by the top-most&#13;
politician in the state of Gujarat, Sanat Mehta-M-e-h-t-a-a very powerful Indian official, who&#13;
was one of the inspirations for this project from the beginning, knew all about it, knew about&#13;
Nehru's interest in it, and all the rest of it. He could speak to it in a way that no one else could&#13;
talk about it.&#13;
&#13;
So a delegation from India was brought to Washington to meet with several people on the Hill&#13;
who had been very critical ofthe Bank. There was a congressman from New York whose name&#13;
escapes me now. I don't know that he's still living. He was a Democrat from New York. He&#13;
invited them to have lunch and to talk about this. There were other meetings with officials&#13;
around town.&#13;
&#13;
The delegation went up to the Hill, went into the House dining room, and this congressman and&#13;
three other congressmen kept them waiting for 45 minutes. He finally showed up, shook hands&#13;
and said, "I'm leaving. I have to go." It was a total, total embarrassment. He was just&#13;
dumbfounded that they were being treated this way.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Mehta.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, and the Indian delegation. It was just a slap in the face.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: It was totally uncalled for, totally uncalled for. Barber Conable was the&#13;
president. He had been brought in because he was head of the House Ways and Means&#13;
Committee. He was an old friend of the Republican power structure. He was the president. I&#13;
was, by then, sort of helping Heinz Vergin and Joe [D. Joseph] Wood, who was the vice&#13;
president for India [South Asia Region], and Ernie Stern, effectively the head of the Bank, trying&#13;
to deal with this. Ernie and Barber Conable said, "We've got to get some kind of an independent&#13;
group to evaluate this." So they said, "We need an independent commission that has nothing to&#13;
do with the Bank to look at the whole thing and do a report." They wanted to do this as a way of&#13;
dealing with the opposition, and to explain to them that we were serious and took this seriously.&#13;
&#13;
Then the question is: who in the hell are we going to get to head this commission? We have to&#13;
get someone with great stature in the world. So we sat around and started kicking around ideas.&#13;
So I proposed, my first proposal was Derek Bok, who had been president of Harvard. I met him&#13;
through the Nieman program. The beauty of Derek was that he was retiring as president of&#13;
Harvard, and he had actually done a lot of work in village India in his younger period. His wife,&#13;
Sissela Bok, was a prominent Scandinavian woman, writer, sociologist. I figured that Derek&#13;
would be a good person to do an independent evaluation of the whole thing. So I called up, and&#13;
he said, "No, I don't want to do this. I'm going out to the West Coast, and Sissela and I have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                56&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
other things to do. I'm sorry. I can't do it."&#13;
&#13;
My next proposal was that we get Mrs. Gro Harlem Brundtland, the former prime minister of&#13;
Norway, to head the commission because she had had a very, very strong record as an&#13;
environmentalist when she was prime minister ofNorway and then went on to head up one of the&#13;
UN agencies. So Conable calls her, and she said no. And he tried a couple of other people, and&#13;
we were just drawing blanks. He finally picked up the phone to talk to his old buddy, Brad&#13;
[Bradford] Morse, the Republican congressman from Massachusetts, whom he had served with&#13;
in the Congress with for a long time. Morse had, I guess it was, diabetes or he was not very well,&#13;
but he agreed to take on the job as head of the commission out of his friendship with Barber&#13;
Conable. Barber said, "I need you to do this."&#13;
&#13;
We tried to get someone international because it was much better if we could do that, but we&#13;
couldn't, so he got Morse. And Morse said, "The only way that I'll do this is if you let me pick a&#13;
staff because I can't be traveling to India. I'm not well. And you provide the budget for doing&#13;
this." So Conable agreed.&#13;
&#13;
Meanwhile, Lori Udall and Bruce Rich were catching wind of this because, you know, the World&#13;
Bank, like Washington, leaks like a sieve, and the word is getting out that not only is the Bank&#13;
having difficulty in finding someone, but they finally were settling on Morse. So she&#13;
immediately goes to work and finds out that there is a very, very good Canadian jurist who had&#13;
worked on the impact of the Alaskan pipeline on native peoples in Canada and the United States&#13;
and was well respected in sociological circles as a fair-minded person, with a strong belief that&#13;
large governments had done injustice to poor Native Americans. That was very important, and&#13;
he was known for this. And she lobbied, and the others lobbied Morse very, very hard to get him&#13;
onboard.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Who is this now?&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: His name was Tom [Thomas R.] Berger-B-e-r-g-e-r. I was asked by Conable&#13;
to go to meet Berger and his wife in London. They were in London on a holiday. We had to&#13;
move fast. So I was asked to get on a plane and see whether I could have lunch with Tom Berger&#13;
and his wife in London, and talk to him about the nature of this project, and try to persuade him&#13;
to take the job.&#13;
&#13;
He had been given some signals from Udall and Morse that this was going to happen, but he had&#13;
not agreed to do it. So I had to persuade him that we would make everything available to him.&#13;
In other words, I, personally, felt that we had to do this. We had to give these people as much&#13;
independence as we possibly could, even though we were going to pay for it. But we had to go&#13;
the extra mile or two to give them total independence.&#13;
&#13;
He insisted-! think I persuaded him that we would make everything available. I would open all&#13;
the files, anything he wanted, carte blanche to the World Bank files, nothing is confidential.&#13;
Legal had nothing to say. The bureaucracy just gets out ofthe way. We've got to do this. We&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                 June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    57&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
have to do this. Don't give us any of this bullshit stuff.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You had the power behind you to make sure that that was going to happen.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Absolutely. None ofthis confidentiality stuff. We're opening up. And I was&#13;
able to tell him that because I got it from Conable and Ernie.&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Yes, I'll take the job, provided you give me the budget to hire my engineer that I&#13;
worked with when I was on this Alaska job; that I hire a sociologist that I know from Ireland&#13;
who has done work with tribal          es"-he knew          whom he wanted-"and two other&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
And we said, "Yes."&#13;
&#13;
We invited his staff and him to come down. They opened up everything, boxes and boxes of&#13;
stuff, had it sent back to Ottawa. They spent time going around. Then they went out to India&#13;
and had several trips. We didn't know what they were doing. There was no-.nothing like that.&#13;
&#13;
But then they produced a report, and they said, "We want to publish this report right away."&#13;
&#13;
We said, "No, that's not fair. We want to look at this report. We want to see this before it sees&#13;
the light of day. We've spent X millions of dollars on this, but we also want to make sure that&#13;
you've got your facts right." There was a big, big fight because they felt that they were truly&#13;
independent and they should be able to publish whatever they came up with.&#13;
&#13;
Fortunately, Ernie, said, "Uh-uh. You're not doing that. You're not going to do that." And he&#13;
had to do some work in the Board to make sure that they were behind him, and they were going&#13;
to do this.&#13;
&#13;
But we were given a deadline. I think the deadline was something like two or three weeks-two&#13;
weeks. I had to work-first of all, they sent this thing to us in draft. It was a devastating report.&#13;
It was totally devastating. They just ripped us apart. And we-and by that I mean me and Joe&#13;
Wood and Ernie-had to produce a response. We had to, first of all, tell them where we thought&#13;
thc~y were wrong, which we did. We had to put it together in about two or three days, and this&#13;
report is like this. I mean, I've never worked so hard in my life. I don't think I was sleeping very&#13;
much. We sent that, and they accepted part of it.&#13;
&#13;
Have you ever seen the Morse Report?&#13;
&#13;
GRA THWOL: No, I haven't.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: A yellow document. It's very interesting. You've got to check it out.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                 58&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Then, we said, "We are going to prepare our own response to your report." So, then, that was&#13;
reallly excruciating because we had to get ready. Morse decided that he was going to release it&#13;
and that he wanted a separate meeting with the Board to present his report on such and such a&#13;
day. He got his day in court. But we were expected to respond to that, not at the same meeting&#13;
but in a subsequent meeting like two days later.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: It's not as though you had a month to review this thing and prepare.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: No, I mean, it was really, really-we were up against it. And so we produced&#13;
the response. He had his day in court in the Board. He was there, and the other members of his&#13;
team were there. That's the day when I told you that-did I tell you about that little incident,&#13;
where I had to make the presentation, the initial opening of the presentation ofthe Bank's&#13;
response to the Board of Directors? And I had a big map of the area, Gujarat and the river and&#13;
everything else. And normally, as I told you with my earlier things about the journey of maps&#13;
and all the fun I had in doing this, and I enjoyed doing this, I had fun doing this, you know, I&#13;
prepared, but I was so nervous on this one.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Oh, yes, you talked about that.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: I had this planned. Ernie had to come up and said, "Okay, do you need my&#13;
help?" to slow me down. I'll never forget that.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: That's right. You did mention that. But I didn't have it in the right context.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Well, that was it. Then, we presented our side ofthe story.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: There's a lot hanging on this.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: The implications ofthis are enormous, and we failed. We failed to turn the&#13;
tide. The tide was really moving against us.&#13;
&#13;
The situation was becoming so bad that the United States said, "Look, you've got to get out of&#13;
this project. You've got to get yourself out of here somehow because you're going to screw up&#13;
the whole IDA negotiations. You will never get any money out of the United States and&#13;
probably the U.K. IDA is at stake here, among other things."&#13;
&#13;
So Conable called on the prime minister of India and said, "Would you please disinvite us out of&#13;
this project?"&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Was this a renewal year for IDA? It's every three years.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: It's every three years. It may be every three years, but it's an ongoing process.&#13;
This must have been, I guess, 1989, '90. I don't know what year it was. But IDA clearly was at&#13;
stake. So the Indian government said, and announced, that "This is our project, our country.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;                                                                                                   59&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
We're tired of all these international NGOs humiliating us and telling us what we should do with&#13;
our people. We are asking the World Bank to get out. We'll do the project on our own."&#13;
&#13;
And the Japanese left. They were going to finance the turbines, and they got out.&#13;
&#13;
So all of this came to naught. That project that we had appraised never ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: The environmental project.&#13;
&#13;
BLlNKHORN: That was just stopped at "green cover." The Narmada Sardar project never&#13;
went through. This dam project was completed by the Indian government in the state of Gujarat,&#13;
and is now doing this.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: It has flooded the lands that were at risk.&#13;
&#13;
BLl[NKHORN: Right. And I don't know that I've heard a peep out of anyone about what's&#13;
actually happening to these people and what's happening down here. If we had been involved,&#13;
my guess is that it might have been better. But in the total scheme of things, the Bank couldn't&#13;
handle it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: It couldn't have sustained the criticism that was being leveled at it.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: It was a tornado. It was a hurricane.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Have you looked at Sebastian Mallaby's book [Mallaby, Sebastian, The World's&#13;
Banker. New York: The Penguin Press, 2004] on ...&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: He has a section in this ...&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: I didn't read-! was going over it. I had read it ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's the 50-year report [Kapur, Devesh, John P.&#13;
Lewis and Richard Webb, The World Bank: Its First Half Century. Washington, D.C.: The&#13;
Brookings Institution, 1997] that has a large section on this by Robert Wade.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, Robert Wade has it, and he's got me in there.&#13;
&#13;
GRATH,VOL: Yes, you're mentioned in it.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: But the interesting thing to me, as I read it, was the NGOs, particularly the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                               June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      60&#13;
&#13;
Am~rican-led   NGOs, picked the Bank not because it had such a bad record on environmental&#13;
issues, although it didn't have a great record, but because it was so vulnerable to American&#13;
political pressure.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I mean, it was strategically a brilliant campaign.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Brilliant, absolutely brilliant campaign, really brilliant. It was very, very good.&#13;
What it did, among other things--! mean it really had the effect of propelling NGOs into the&#13;
wider development forums in a way that they had not been before. There had been NGOs&#13;
working here but never like this. So when Jim Wolfensohn came along, one ofhis commanding&#13;
objectives was we've got to embrace these NGOs. He went out of his way to an extent that a lot&#13;
of people were saying, "Wait a minute now. This is just overdoing it here with these people&#13;
because half of them are airy-fairy kinds of people. They don't know what they're doing.&#13;
They're do-gooders that don't do their homework." It was that kind ofthing.&#13;
&#13;
But that experience really just pushed them right into the limelight, gave them far more influence&#13;
than they ever had before. They brought down the World Bank. They changed something, and&#13;
they did it very, very effectively. It was brilliant, absolutely brilliant.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Not entirely fair, but brilliant.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Not fair, and there was a lot of deceit, and there was a lot of manipulation and&#13;
untruth and all the rest of it, but the timing was perfect, and it was great.&#13;
&#13;
The: other thing it did, it resulted in two major developments within the institution, that was the&#13;
whole re-examination of the guidelines and the regulations with respect to the native peoples,&#13;
vulnerable tribals and others, and also the whole environmental implications of what we do.&#13;
That changed dramatically. The whole thing was changed. It was strengthened. The new&#13;
procedures were put in place, a whole new Environment Department was created. It had&#13;
tremendous implications for the institution, and it lasts.&#13;
&#13;
It probably went in the other way too much because the due diligence became, by the time I was&#13;
working in the former Soviet Union, I mean, it was just, my God, the kinds of hoops we had to&#13;
go through. I kept saying to myself, "Did we really do this through the Narmada?" And the&#13;
answer was yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: It brought some very competent people to the Bank in the environmental field,&#13;
apparently.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, Gloria [Jean] Davis and all that crowd. The other thing it did, it created&#13;
this whole independent tribunal [Inspection Panel] that exists-that exists today.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 61&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 GRATHWOL: Within the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
 BLINKHORN: No, it's outside the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
 GRATHWOL: Outside the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
 BLINKHORN: And it reports to the Board, not to the president.&#13;
&#13;
 GRATHWOL: I wasn't aware of that.&#13;
&#13;
 BLINKHORN: Yes, yes, yes.&#13;
&#13;
 GRATHWOL: Explain that a little more. How did that come about?&#13;
&#13;
 BLllNKHORN: It came about because ofNarmada, and because of the experience with the&#13;
 Narmada tribunal, the commission.&#13;
&#13;
 GRATHWOL: The Morse Commission.&#13;
&#13;
 BLllNKHORN: The Morse Commission demonstrated that it was possible, even though the&#13;
 money was coming from the Bank, it was possible to have a detached, candid assessment of what&#13;
 the institution was doing. And in a way that was not necessarily possible through the other&#13;
 mechanisms that existed within the institution, including the Operations Evaluation Department.&#13;
 That experience not only created that independent tribunal, which reports to the Board, it also&#13;
 strengthened the hand ofthe Operations Evaluation Department, which reports to the Board and&#13;
 not to the president.&#13;
&#13;
 The head of it is Vinod Thomas. I just communicated with him. He's been producing reports&#13;
 that are very critical of the Bank, things that never existed. When Bob [Robert] Picciotto was in&#13;
 charge, they would do independent evaluations. That's what their job is supposed to be. But&#13;
 there was always, you know, I'll scratch your back, you scratch mine, we're all in this together&#13;
 kind ofthing. But now it's a very, very different game. It's very independent. So these&#13;
 institutional changes resulted from Narmada; all that came out of that.&#13;
&#13;
  By then, let's see, what happened? Oh, through that experience, I got very close to Ernie Stern. I&#13;
  had known him before but never really worked with him that closely, and we were under fire,&#13;
  and Joe Wood. I won his trust. So when this was all over, I said, "Look, I'm exhausted. I'm not&#13;
  only exhausted, but my marriage is coming to an end. This whole experience has ruined my&#13;
  marriage. I was spending more time in India than I was home. I fell in love with someone else.&#13;
Â· It was just unraveling. I've just got to stop this. I've got to get out ofthis."&#13;
&#13;
 So he helped me get out and become-into my next life, which was, by this time, the new&#13;
 Region was created. That was Europe and Central Asia. It never existed before. As you may&#13;
 recall, Russia and the Eastern European countries were never part of the World Bank ..&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: .. even though Russia was represented at Bretton Woods in 1944-45. The only&#13;
countries that had been part ofthe Bank were Romania and, I think, Hungary, but with the&#13;
collapse of communism, all these countries started banging on the doors. They went into the&#13;
UN.. They came into the Bank. So we had to create a whole new institutional accommodation&#13;
for them, brand new vice presidency, brand new directors, brand new that. The director for the&#13;
Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Ukraine, Belarus, Georgia, Armenia, and&#13;
Azerbaijan was none other than my old friend from Copenhagen, Basil Kavalsky.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I'm mindful of the time.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, I am too.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Maybe we should stop there.&#13;

GRA.THWOL: This is an interview with Thomas Blinkhorn on June 18th,2008, conducted as a&#13;
part of the World Bank Archives Oral History Program at the World Bank main offices in&#13;
downtown Washington, D.C., by Robert P. Grathwol. This is session three.&#13;
&#13;
Tom, I want to go back to what we talked about yesterday and raise a question that you had&#13;
touched upon yesterday, and that was the Morse report. You said it was, in ways, unfair to the&#13;
Bank, but you didn't specify. You talked a lot about the Bank's response to it. You didn't specify&#13;
in what ways it was unfair, and I'd like to hear a little more about that.&#13;
&#13;
BL1[NKHORN: Sure. Well, I think the main-there are several aspects of the work that they&#13;
did that I felt was unfair. The most egregious, I felt, was the fact that they did not give adequate&#13;
attention, either in their analysis or in their report, to the context and the background in which&#13;
this project had originated. We made an effort to try to get them to do that. Tom Berger took the&#13;
position, he said, "Well, that is not what we were hired to do. We were not hired to provide&#13;
context or to review history. We were asked to look at what the World Bank had done with this&#13;
project, and what went right or what went wrong, and that's what we were asked to do."&#13;
&#13;
I think that was a narrow reading ofthe terms of reference because any fair-minded group&#13;
looking at this project had to take into account the long history of drought in India. I pointed out,&#13;
wh&lt;::m I started this story in an earlier session, a speech that Lyndon Johnson had given in Omaha,&#13;
Nebraska, in the late '60s.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: That was a very, very telling incident because it spoke to a long, long-term&#13;
problem that India had with famine and drought, resulting from poor agricultural practices, in&#13;
part, but also through climate problems. So the issue, going all the way back earlier to the Indus&#13;
waters, which was a major project that the World Bank, under Eugene [R.] Black, had helped to&#13;
resolve between India and Pakistan after partition, which was the sort of a core, the lifeline for&#13;
these two countries that had been split, that issue of tapping water for irrigation, that had always&#13;
been a matter of great urgency and concern for the Indians, and for the international community&#13;
to try to help the Indians.&#13;
&#13;
So as you looked at the country and as you looked at the problems in the west, then you had to&#13;
conclude this is what we were dealing with. The report of the Morse Commission was very&#13;
critical-legitimately so on many aspects of what we had done-but they did not take into&#13;
account the context, nor did they ask themselves, "Okay, they made a mistake. They shouldn't&#13;
have done it this way. What should they have done differently in order to respond to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                    64&#13;
&#13;
problem that the Indians asked us to try to address?" So that was a major shortcoming, in my&#13;
view, and a major source of unfairness.&#13;
&#13;
The other thing that I felt was unfair is that none ofthose individuals had ever been to India and&#13;
had taken the time to really investigate and try to understand the class structure, the caste&#13;
structure, the role of tribals, the different groups and how they had been treated, and what had&#13;
gone on previously over many, many centuries in India, and to try to use that history to try to&#13;
undÂ·~rstand why the Indians took the position they did with respect to the people who were going&#13;
to be displaced. Because in all of Indian history, in the colonial period and back, people were&#13;
constantly being displaced in cities because it's a huge, massive country. They were being&#13;
moved around.&#13;
&#13;
Now, on the books, there was legislation that said that they had to be treated in a particular way,&#13;
with justice and equity and all the rest. In some cases they were, and in some cases they weren't.&#13;
It depended on what state they were in. If they were in a Congress state, like Madhya Pradesh,&#13;
or like Uttar Pradesh, or one of the big states, then they would-and the Congress was running&#13;
the country, the Congress Party was in command-then the people in that state would,&#13;
undoubtedly, be treated better than the people in West Bengal, which was headed by a socialist, a&#13;
communist government. It was the same kind of thing that you find in many democracies,&#13;
including the United States. Some states, depending on who's in charge of Washington, get&#13;
better treatment than others. That is a fact of political life. It may not be right, it may not be&#13;
morally right, but it also helps to explain, to some extent, why there wasn't the kind of fervor for&#13;
the kind of implementation that they were addressing.&#13;
&#13;
The other thing is I think that as a result of these, they were setting a gold standard for behavior&#13;
that I think is very, very rare in international development. I think that that is good to set a gold&#13;
standard and to try to achieve it, but sometimes you don't. When you don't, do you say, "Okay,&#13;
get out"? No, we don't do it that way. We try to reach the gold standard, recognizing that&#13;
sometimes we may not be able to get there.&#13;
&#13;
So I think they were too evangelical. I think that Berger-! told you the history of how he got&#13;
into this. I think that he came in with his own hidden agenda. I don't think that he was fair-&#13;
minded in the beginning, but he had credentials as a Canadianjudge and as a jurist, and he was&#13;
well respected in many parts of Canada. So he was accepted by the commission. So, for those&#13;
reasons, I think it was unfair.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I have a better sense of what it was that was a problem with the report.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Nonetheless, the Bank responded to it.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Right. Yes, and we took it. We acknowledged our errors, and we not only&#13;
acknowledged our errors, but we took-the Bank took steps to make sure that that kind of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
activity was to be mitigated in the future.&#13;
&#13;
GRA.THWOL: We left off there because the next part of your career seems to put you in quite&#13;
a different context.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Totally different. I mean, here I'm going from Africa to India. And as you&#13;
know, through the Narmada experience, I got very close to Ernie Stern, and he had helped me get&#13;
to India. So I went back to him, and I said, "Ernie, you know, I've had enough of this. My&#13;
marriage is coming apart, and I need a break," and whatnot.&#13;
&#13;
So he said that he would try to get me a division chief job-a promotion-with a full division&#13;
chief, which I had been expecting when I went to India, which I didn't get. I was called a senior&#13;
programming officer. But Ernie helped push this, and he turned it over to Basil Kavalsky, who&#13;
was-you may recall, the Europe and Central Asia Region had been recently created after the&#13;
fall of communism. It was a brand-new Region that was started inl991, and they were gearing&#13;
up, starting new departments for countries that had never been members of the Bank. Russia&#13;
became a member and all the rest.&#13;
&#13;
So they were looking for new staff, new managers, and I was asked to start from scratch, from&#13;
bare bones, a brand-new Municipal Housing Division [Housing and Municipal Services&#13;
Division] to serve the countries of the Baltics (Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania), Ukraine, Moldova,&#13;
Belarus, Armenia, and Georgia. Basil was the Director. He, as you may recall, was my friend&#13;
from my first days in the Bank. So he asked me would I come and start up this new division.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: What year was this?&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: This was '93. I said, "I'd be delighted." I was so happy to get out of all of that&#13;
mess, and I was so happy to be offered a new challenge in a part of the world that I had not&#13;
known, and to be starting out just myself. I was sitting in an empty office, and I had to start from&#13;
scratch, to hire staff and try to devise a strategy, and then figure out what we're going to do in&#13;
these countries to start the process of helping local communities develop housing. That's how it&#13;
started. Because the whole issue of accommodation was a major, major issue in that part of the&#13;
world because the state had owned everything.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: With the collapse of communism, that all collapsed. You had large-every&#13;
building, every asset, no one knew who owned what. A lot of people-particularly in the&#13;
Baltics, a lot of people were coming back from Israel. The Jews had been kicked out, and they&#13;
said, "That:s my grandmother's." There were all kinds of challenges going on.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Challenges, yes.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Others, not just Jews, were coming back and remembering, "That was my&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                66&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
house, and you're living in my house and we want you out." People had no notion about what&#13;
private housing was. There was nothing like a cadastre. There was nothing like a register of&#13;
ownership. The state had everything. The state provided central heating. It did everything. So I&#13;
had to try to find some people who had done work on municipal housing around other parts of&#13;
the world to come and join me in this new venture.&#13;
&#13;
I hired a secretary first, and then I got a couple of people, Y oshi [Yoshine] U chimura from Asia,&#13;
a Japanese economist who had done a lot of work in municipal work. I got a Frenchman by the&#13;
name of Robert Maurer, who had done similar kinds of work in Africa. Then I started hiring&#13;
people like that. We moved to the H building. One of our first-this is '93, now, mind you, and&#13;
I think I took over in--and I was just sort of slowly hiring. It takes a lot oftime to try to find&#13;
people. Ideally, we would want to have someone that spoke Russian. That was the lingua franca&#13;
of that area.&#13;
&#13;
So Basil, fortunately, had found a young Georgian guy by the name of Bidzina Imnadze.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You're going to have to spell that one for me.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes. He was working in the executive director's office for Russia, a very, very&#13;
bright young man.&#13;
&#13;
And he said, "You know, I think that Bidzina is very interested in coming into the Bank. Would&#13;
you be interested in having him join your team?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Let me talk to him." So I talked to him, and I hired him on the spot because he was&#13;
bright and he was young and he was eager and he knew Georgia. He knew the Soviet system,&#13;
and he knew how to speak Russian, and he spoke perfect English. He was very invaluable to me.&#13;
He went on to get an MBA from Harvard and then joined some big investment house in London.&#13;
&#13;
But trying to find people who knew that part of the world and knew the language was&#13;
extraordinarily difficult.&#13;
&#13;
So here we are gearing up, and they're getting new office space and everything. Then, out of the&#13;
blue, carne--bang-Wolfensohn is now the president, "[Eduard] Shevardnadze has just called&#13;
me. He wants an emergency rehabilitation mission immediately." This is August 1993. So the&#13;
order came down.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: It doesn't seem right with the year because Wolfensohn doesn't become&#13;
president until '95.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Oh, maybe I got it wrong. '95, was it?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I think so.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   67&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Oh, I thought it was '93. Okay, you're right.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: You may have started the office in '93.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: I started the office in '93, but Wolfensohn came on in '95, you're right. But the&#13;
order came from-we did something before then.&#13;
&#13;
GRA.THWOL: Okay.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: So one of the things that we did right away is to go around to these countries,&#13;
starting with the Baltics because we had an office in Estonia, in Tallinn. There was a Canadian&#13;
guy there whose name escapes me now. Basil said, "Well, look, why don't you ... "&#13;
&#13;
You know, I was explaining to him how difficult it was for us to-"I mean, I can have staff and&#13;
evetything, but we have to go out there, and we have to get to know these countries, get to know&#13;
who the actors are, get to know what their views are of housing and what would they think about&#13;
setting up a system of adjudication to adjudicate all these claims, and then to start getting some&#13;
elements of a rule of law so that you could have a cadastre, and you could have a registry of who&#13;
owns what." That was essential, in order to begin to look at housing, and how you might be able&#13;
to mobilize money.&#13;
&#13;
The reason that the emphasis was put on housing is that the then-vice president for the Region,&#13;
Wilfried [P.] Thalwitz, a German, he had a lot of experience and had studied the reconstruction&#13;
of Europe, particularly Germany, after World War II. He felt very strongly-he believed that&#13;
one of the ways that reconstruction was facilitated and implemented quickly is that people&#13;
were-there were mechanisms put in place to get people housing. They started having a stake in&#13;
a community with a house that they could-that was their asset. And then they could take care&#13;
of that house and protect it, and do whatever. He felt strongly that that would be an essential part&#13;
of any transition strategy in Eastern Europe after communism. Other people were working at the&#13;
macro level on monetary issues, on exchange rates and how do you denominate the currencies,&#13;
and how do you set up a system of pricing. Other people were doing that. But at our level, at the&#13;
regional and local level, his belief is that you've got to get in there and demonstrate, as quickly as&#13;
you can, that we were working to give you an asset that you would live in and that would inspire&#13;
you and give you an incentive to work with us. That was the theory behind it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Ownership not only of property, but ofthe system.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: That's exactly right. Yes. So that was part of it.&#13;
&#13;
He was right. I mean, you just can't go in there and start preaching capitalism, and you can't talk&#13;
about, "Where's your equity? Where's your collateral for a loan?" because there was no financial&#13;
system. It was that kind of thing.&#13;
&#13;
So we had to disabuse ourselves of a lot of notions that are very-sort of ingrained in us, that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   68&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
part of our DNA, when it comes to how you order your life, you have to have a down payment,&#13;
you have to have a bank, you have to have a title, all of that stuff that you and I take for granted,&#13;
we had to just take that out of our minds and just start fresh.&#13;
&#13;
So Basil's view is that there are some really tough nuts you're going to have to crack here.&#13;
Ukraine is huge, and they are still communist, and the other states are a lot poorer. But the&#13;
Baltics, because of the fact that they were not traditionally communist, that they had this&#13;
relationship with the Scandinavian countries, that there was this whole wave of freedom that had&#13;
emerged out of Lithuania, and [Mikhail S.] Gorbachev and all the rest, those countries probably&#13;
would be easier to work with, to get something going, so that we could demonstrate to the others&#13;
what was possible. So that was the way the strategy started to evolve.&#13;
&#13;
So we took missions to all three Baltic countries, and we. met a lot of people. We went outside&#13;
the capitals. We've got to get a sense of what these places were like. We quickly learned that&#13;
these huge Khrushchev-type buildings were just ghastly, terrible things. The heating system was&#13;
terrible; the energy and the construction standards were lousy. So we started devising&#13;
mechanisms with the local governments to try to show demonstration and pilot projects. We&#13;
worked in Vilnius and Riga and Tallinn to start, and then we moved out from the capitals into&#13;
smaller cities to try to tackle the most serious problems that they had. Like, for example, in the&#13;
city ofDaugavpils, in Latvia, they had a very serious water supply problem, in providing clean&#13;
water to the community. So we tackled that right away and made that part of a municipal&#13;
reconstruction project that would include some work on the rudiments of a housing strategy.&#13;
&#13;
. We also partnered with the institute in Cambridge that had done a lot of analysis of housing and&#13;
  municipal governance in the former Soviet Union, the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy,&#13;
  associated with Harvard. There were a lot of people there that knew-and USAID, very early,&#13;
  had set up a system under Ray Stark, I believe his name was, in Moscow. These people knew a&#13;
  lot more than we did about the way the system worked.&#13;
&#13;
So we went to them, and we hired some of them to be consultants, and we also hired consultants&#13;
from the Scandinavian countries. Pretty soon we were getting teams of people to start working&#13;
on this. Within a couple of years, my staff was getting larger, and we were starting to have a&#13;
track record.&#13;
&#13;
I'm not clear about the timing on this, but I think it was roughly around the time that Wolfensohn&#13;
came in and started sending signals that he was going to take a hard look at the Bank and the way&#13;
it was organized, or not organized properly. Remember, he had a huge reorganization coming up&#13;
in 1997 and 1998. But he also sent a signal quite early that you better look at your budgets&#13;
because they're going to be cut.                  Â·&#13;
&#13;
So Thalwitz-by then I think Johannes [F.] Linn had then come on as the vice president for our&#13;
Region, replacing Thalwitz. I think that's correct. Anyway, he and Basil and the others decided&#13;
that we had too many divisions and we had to consolidate. We also wanted to make sure that in&#13;
each of these capitals in all of the countries that we had our representative, because we were&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  69&#13;
&#13;
 setting up country offices with a resident representative. In those, there would be someone who&#13;
 was attached to my division and someone would be attached to the Environment Division. So&#13;
 we had someone on that could be our sort of liaison individual.&#13;
&#13;
  But this was very expensive, and so a decision was made that when one of the-there are two&#13;
  country programs divisions, and a vacancy had occurred in one of them. Basil asked Jim [James&#13;
  Q.] Harrison, who had been head of the Human Resources Division, a very large division, he&#13;
  asked Jim to become the programs division chief [Country Operations Division 1]. And he&#13;
  asked me, because I had the smallest division [Housing and Municipal Services Division], ifi&#13;
  would take on this new, enlarged division [Municipal and Social Services Division]. So I&#13;
  agreed, and so I suddenly had something on the order of 30 or 40 people working for me,&#13;
Â· including staff who were working on health programs, education programs, pension reform, all&#13;
  of that stuff. That, together with municipal infrastructure, then became and we named it the&#13;
  Municipal and Social Services Division.&#13;
&#13;
 Now, I had never been really in the field of health or education. I had dealt with it peripherally.&#13;
 But I was suddenly confronted with managing large numbers of people in sectors that I was&#13;
 unfamiliar with. I really had to learn to become a manager. I had to go to special training, and I&#13;
 had to learn to control my temper, which was quite vigorous, and to be patient with people. I'm&#13;
 not patient. I'm one that drives very hard. But I learned that in order to herd these cats, that I&#13;
 had to be much more patient, kind to people and to, you know, build teams. Team building was&#13;
 the key.&#13;
&#13;
 So that was coming along when, out of the blue, one day, I guess it was '95, a rocket came from&#13;
 Wolfensohn's office that he had just had an urgent request from Shevardnadze, the president of&#13;
 Georgia (which had joined the Bank just a year or two or so ago), that they were coming out of&#13;
 an earthquake, the civil war was over, and they needed an emergency rehabilitation project&#13;
 urgently because there was no power in the capital. The water supply was not working properly,&#13;
 and in the key cities ofPoti-P-o-t-i-and Batumi-B-a-t-u-m-i-on the Black Sea, they also&#13;
 needed attention. So could the Bank please send a mission urgently to Georgia.&#13;
&#13;
 So I dropped everything, and I said to Basil, "You know, I think I ought to do this. If you want&#13;
 this done quickly and you want something done fast, we can't monkey around with a lot of&#13;
 analysis. So I'm going to head the mission. I'll take it out there myself, and I'll give you a&#13;
 project pretty fast. I'll cut through the bureaucracy."&#13;
&#13;
 He said, "Okay."&#13;
&#13;
 In those days, money was no obstacle. I had a team of 22 people, and I hired engineers from the&#13;
 U.K. and Bidzina and a couple of other people who knew the area. We went out to Georgia, and&#13;
 it was one of the most challenging missions that I've ever faced. I've had a couple of others&#13;
 subsequently, but the problem was really bad. There was no electricity. There was no water.&#13;
 We had to buy our own water. We stayed in the Metechi Palace. In order to get to Georgia, this&#13;
 was quite a harrowing event because there was no-the only airline into Tbilisi was an airline&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                 June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  70&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
called Gorbi-G-o-r-b-i. It operated out of Prague, and it only operated on a Sunday afternoon.&#13;
There was only one day that you could get a flight into Tbilisi, and one day out was on Friday.&#13;
So trying to book seats on Gorbi proved to be a very, very-fortunately, American Express&#13;
managed to do it. But they warned me that "You have to be careful. We don't know where their&#13;
offices are in the Prague airport. There is no evidence that they're there. We're told they are&#13;
there. The plane comes at such and such a time. It will be there, we're guaranteed. Here is your&#13;
business class or first-class ticket, and we got it for everyone." We're all agreed, we were&#13;
org&lt;:mized to be there on a Sunday.&#13;
&#13;
We get there on a Sunday. Well, we actually got there on a Saturday. We get there and go to the&#13;
airport. There is no sign of Gorbi Airlines. No one knows what we're talking about. There is&#13;
nothing up there to indicate anything. Finally, one of our team went over and talked to some-&#13;
Bidzina or someone found a guy sweeping the floor and found out that the representative was&#13;
over behind the stairs, under a stairway. And we went over there, and there was a little old table&#13;
and some gnarled old guy, with a stack of American twenty dollar bills, huge stacks on the table,&#13;
a long line that extended all the way back.&#13;
&#13;
So, I said, "Bidzina, you and I are going to go to the front of the line and talk to this guy right&#13;
away and tell him what we're up to." So Bidzina came with me, and all of these people are&#13;
looking, wondering who the hell is barging in like this. So I told him, "I've got 22 people going&#13;
to Tbilisi to help get the water started."&#13;
&#13;
He says, "Okay, okay, okay. Fine, fine. But twenties, only twenties." And he was looking at&#13;
each twenty.&#13;
&#13;
Fortunately, I had been told by someone don't bring anything but twenties. We had to have&#13;
stacks of twenties in order to get on that damn plane. We had reservations, but you couldn't get a&#13;
ticket in Washington. We only had reservations. Fortunately, they had names of everybody, but&#13;
we had to pay in cash and no curls; it had to be very crisp twenties. Got it.&#13;
&#13;
Then, we had to carry our luggage out to the plane, stuff it up there and go in and thought we had&#13;
first class. We start sitting at the front of the plane. "Nyet, nyet." This big, husky stewardess&#13;
comes by, "Nyet, nyet." And all these seats are empty. I don't know if you've ever been in these&#13;
old Tupolevs?&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: No.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: At the front of the airplane, behind the pilot, there are facing seats, sort oflike a&#13;
compartment. It would have-you would sit there, and I would sit there, and in between ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Like a rail car.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Exactly. In between would be a table that collapsed. So there were four here&#13;
and four here, and they're all empty. I said, "Man, let's go. Just grab them. Just grab them."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   71&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
She allowed us, after a lot of pushing and shoving, to take every one but this one in the front.&#13;
This one she refused to let it, and we couldn't figure it out. Some of our people had to go all the&#13;
way in the back, but those four were kept open until we were ready to go. When we're ready to&#13;
go, in comes this big guy with huge, huge satchels loaded with clanging stuff, and he sits down&#13;
and puts his bags right there. He takes the whole thing. She brings him out a bottle of vodka.&#13;
&#13;
I said to Bidzina, "Find out who that is." It's the plane mechanic.&#13;
&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: So we're off to Tbilisi. It was the wildest scene. And they were serving-&#13;
everyone was drunk. I mean, there was just nonstop vodka all the way to Tbilisi. It was just&#13;
horrendous. Then they served just hard bread, and it was this old Russian Tupolev that I don't&#13;
know how we got there because subsequent missions of the Bank, they ran out of gasoline&#13;
because they didn't have enough money to purchase the gas, and they had to stop in these small&#13;
places in Russia to beg the Russians for fuel in order to get to Tbilisi. It was that kind of thing,&#13;
&#13;
We arrive at Tbilisi at three o'clock in the morning, and there's total darkness, one little light. A&#13;
truck comes out and takes us in there. Then someone just dumps all of the luggage into the back-&#13;
end of another truck, takes it over and dumps it right at the edge of the reception area.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: What time of year was this?&#13;
&#13;
BL1lNKHORN: This was in 1995, August.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: August, okay. So it's not the dead of winter.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: No, no, no, no, but it's the dead of night, and we're very tired.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, it took us several hours to get out of there and get started. But then it goes on and on&#13;
and on. We met Shevardnadze. We got carte blanche to do whatever we did. And we traveled&#13;
all over the place, and we got a project to the Board before Christmas, and they were very, very&#13;
grateful for that.&#13;
&#13;
Then I turned over the supervision to Robert Maurer. He took over after that, and we got going&#13;
on a big program in Georgia, first on that, and then on a social development fund and lots of&#13;
other things. So that was an exciting development.&#13;
&#13;
Then another big, big challenge was in Ukraine, and just trying to deal with former communists&#13;
in Ukraine was quite a struggle. On our first mission, we-out to the city ofLviv, in the western&#13;
part of Ukraine, because we felt that-we were told that there was some possibility for municipal&#13;
development with housing and whatnot. But the only way that we could get out there-and it&#13;
was in winter, the roads were so bad and there were no flights-that we had to hire our own&#13;
railway car.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
They arranged for us to get the car that Stalin used to use when he traveled from Moscow to&#13;
Kiev and down to Tbilisi because he was born near Tbilisi. This was quite a car. It was opulent,&#13;
in the old 19th century style, with chandeliers and private beds, a coal-burning stove in the&#13;
center, where you had a huge sitting room. And then for the head of the mission, he had his own&#13;
bathtub in there, and the water was heated by coal. And you could put about three people in that&#13;
bathtub it was so big. So that's where I was.&#13;
&#13;
[Laughter]&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: So Eric Peterson was with us by then and Kristin [A.] Gilbertson had been-I&#13;
was trying to hire as many YPs as I could, and she was one of the first. She was a Harvard&#13;
economist who did a lot of work on finance. I       believed in                  le and 1-'"'~Â·~ll~"'ES&#13;

                                                                                                          ::!:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Then, the second big challenge was the Ukraine coal sector. The Bank had, in Ukraine, had         o&#13;
                                                                                                 tÂ£1&#13;
undertaken a massive privatization effort of all the state enterprises. This was part of the     f:-1..&gt;&#13;
&#13;
ideology that we spoke of earlier. The aim was either to downsize or to privatize or to close&#13;
them completely. One of the biggest challenges was the coal-mining sector because Ukraine&#13;
had,. in addition to all its wheat, had been a source of great coal. And in the Donetsk area, in&#13;
Eastern Ukraine, this was the center of the fuel that provided the energy source for Russia's&#13;
industrialization. And Lenin and Stalin, they all would come out to Donetsk, the great workers&#13;
of the socialist world were there, and they have huge statues and everything else. They would&#13;
give awards, Stalin and Lenin, awards to the man who could mine the most coal. There's&#13;
placards and things all over.&#13;
&#13;
By the time we were there, they had 284 coal mines, and our assessment, carried out with experts&#13;
from the United Kingdom where Margaret Thatcher had gone through a similar downsizing, they&#13;
estimated that the only possible viable ones were maybe 90 to 100. So we had to close,&#13;
according to our analysis, 184 coal mines. The question was, how do you go about doing that?&#13;
We had no notion.&#13;
&#13;
So we came up with a strategy that we would have a pilot project, and we would start with three&#13;
mines in three separate social areas in the Donetsk Oblast-an oblast is basically a province or a&#13;
state-in Eastern Ukraine. Our job was to put together a program of closure that would&#13;
eliminate-show that these mines could be closed because they were bleeding the country. The&#13;
budget impact of keeping these mines open was horrendous. So they had to be closed. But you&#13;
had to be closed with a mind to what happens to the people because they're in communities like&#13;
the one I grew up with ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I was going to say, this is coming back to your roots in a lot of ways.&#13;
&#13;

                                      Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                 June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                        73&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Exactly, coming back.&#13;
&#13;
 .. that are totally dependent on coal. What happens to these people? So, on the books, the&#13;
Ukrainians had laws about unemployment insurance and disability insurance. They had all of&#13;
that, but they were not being honored.&#13;
&#13;
So we agreed to provide something on the order of $17 million or so for the closure of the three&#13;
mines on the condition that we would put in place several mitigation programs. We would .&#13;
ensure that the people affected and their families would be getting what is their due under&#13;
Ukrainian law, in terms of severance payments, in terms of unemployment compensation,&#13;
disability, retraining, help with small microenterprises, a full, full program ofthat kind of thing.&#13;
Plus, we wanted to make sure-and this was in the front of my mind-that any environmental&#13;
impact of closing mines and taking water out of mines and dumping them into a stream would&#13;
not happen if there was any adverse environmental impact. So we're not going to destroy water&#13;
courses or drinking water. We have to do a total environmental analysis and mitigation. So that&#13;
was another part of it. So this took a lot of work.&#13;
&#13;
I got personally involved in this and went there several times. I'll never forget one time in the&#13;
winter, March of-I forget the year-where I was asked to go to one of these three pilot sites in a&#13;
terrible place called Scheznoya, about an hour outside of the city of Donetsk. I'll never forget it.&#13;
It was just such a terrible scene. This was this dingy community building that housed maybe 100&#13;
people, about 500 showed up because they heard the World Bank was coming. The whole idea&#13;
was for us, as well as the officials from Kiev and the local officials, to explain to the people what&#13;
we were trying to do.&#13;
&#13;
We were also trying to do social analysis work. Incidentally, this is where Betsy, my current&#13;
wife-she was part of a team doing social analysis to find out who these people were, what&#13;
their-and it turned out that we discovered all kinds of things about these people and their&#13;
ailments and the rest.&#13;
&#13;
So there's this meeting, and it's just mobbed. I got up and made a speech, and it was translated&#13;
verbatim. I started off by saying that I come from a coal-mining community and that I know a&#13;
little bit about this, and I got their attention by doing that. I said that one of the things that we&#13;
wanted to make sure is that you receive what is your due in terms of this and that. They didn't&#13;
beli,eve that. "No, they're lying. They will never do that."&#13;
&#13;
And I promised that, "Here's Vladimir [G. Kreacic]. He's my staff member. He's in Kiev.&#13;
Here's his telephone number. We're going to have two people come out here and stay here that&#13;
are being paid by us, not by the government, and they will be monitoring this. If you have any&#13;
complaints, here's Sean O'Connell, from the United States, and another young guy, Lucan Way,"&#13;
a Harvard graduate who spoke fluent Russian. And actually Sean did, too, because he was&#13;
married to a Ukrainian. We hired these two just to stay out there and monitor what was going&#13;
on.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                 June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                     74&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So these poor people came up, you know, limping up and showing me X-rays of their husband's&#13;
backs and how they'd been hurt or killed, and on and on and on. It just brought tears to your eyes&#13;
to see this.&#13;
&#13;
So that experience had a great impact on me. The whole idea was to use that experience to&#13;
inform the design of the larger program of closure.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: There were three mines as a pilot project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                      We had&#13;
more fights with the Coal Ministry [Ministry of Coal Industry] and the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
&#13;
Then, we had fights within the Bank because a different division, not my division-we just did&#13;
the pilot work to sort oftest all of this--but another division, the Industrial Division, was going to&#13;
take over the larger program. The whole idea there is that we would put in a large sort of&#13;
structural adjustment loan, several hundred million dollars, provided they close the mine in a&#13;
phased way, and they would get this money. There was not the kind of attention to the social&#13;
mitigation environment that I thought was essential. They said, "Well, you know, we'll try our&#13;
best." So we had this tension going on.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This is within the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BLlNKHORN: Within the Bank. Yes, within the Bank. And I kept banging, saying, "Listen,&#13;
you guys, you cannot go ahead on with this unless you&#13;
do ... "&#13;
&#13;
And they'd say, "Yes, but this is too important to be dillying around with this."&#13;
&#13;
It was that kind of thing. That went on for quite some time.&#13;
&#13;
I got involved with other things because I was managing a-I couldn't be the task manager for&#13;
this. I started it, just like I did in Georgia, but I had to hand it over to someone else.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: It must have tugged at your psyche in some ways.&#13;
&#13;
BLlNKHORN: It did. It. really did, and I wanted to stay with it, but I had to decide-! had to&#13;
be a manager of a lot of other things. I just can't do this all the time, as much as I loved it. I&#13;
mean, I liked it, but it was just searing. It was r~ally, really bad.&#13;
&#13;
So, okay, now we're getting into the reorganization of'67, '68-I mean '97 and '98. We went&#13;
through, again, as ~,'e did earlier, this whole business of, "Okay, you've got to sign up for the new&#13;
job. Everyone's fired. You've got to apply."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16,17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               75&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
So Basil just told us, "I don't want to stay in Washington anymore. I want to get out into the&#13;
field. I want to be"-so he got a job as the resident representative in Warsaw. That was, for me,&#13;
not very good because he had been my friend, and he really supported me through this period. I&#13;
didn't know who was going to be coming in, and the whole thing was being reorganized anyway.&#13;
I didn't know what ...&#13;
&#13;
So I was out of a job like everyone else. I, in 1998, applied for I think it was a Rural Division&#13;
[Rural Development/Environment Sector Unit], one of the Rural Divisions. I forget exactly how&#13;
it was-but I didn't get the job. And so the Bank offered me a package. They said, "We'll give&#13;
you such and such and such if you walk."&#13;
&#13;
I said, "I don't want to walk. I want to stay working here. I like what I'm doing. I, frankly, I&#13;
mean, I don't particularly want to be a division chief." Because by this time, the division chief&#13;
job was a lot more than building teams and getting young people and mentoring them, which I&#13;
enjoyed a lot, and devising strategy. A lot of it was process, processing documents, making sure&#13;
that they were consistent, I's dotted and T's crossed, that you get the budget right and don't go&#13;
over this and make sure that you do this.&#13;
&#13;
But the worst of all was the performance reviews. They were just horrible. By this time, they&#13;
were doing 360 reviews, where you had to-not only I would review your performance and you&#13;
would tell me what you thought was going on and we'd have a conversation and then on the basis&#13;
of that, you would get a raise, or maybe no raise at all, or whatever, but you would have peer&#13;
reviews. You would have to say, or I would say, "Yu have to get opinions from three or four&#13;
others within the department and outside the department."&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Co-workers and others.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Co-workers, yes. So you had peer reviews of performance. And, you know, to&#13;
get these things and, oh, Jesus, it was just a pain. So I was quite delighted, frankly-! would&#13;
have preferred to have been a manager of another division, but they said no. So they said, "Well,&#13;
how about being a program"-what do they call them? Not senior country program officer, but&#13;
it was a program coordinator, I guess it was, for Ukraine.&#13;
&#13;
By this time, I had known Ukraine pretty well. They knew that I had known Ukraine. I had not&#13;
only done the coal work, I was doing a lot of work on municipal governance and reform, and I&#13;
had gotten involved in a couple of very interesting projects, a pilot project for tuberculosis&#13;
control in the prisons in the city of Odessa, working with the World Health Organization, and I&#13;
fow1d that very exciting. So I said, "Fine, I'll do that."&#13;
&#13;
Basically, what it was is: I was in control ofthe Ukraine program, reporting to-I forget who-&#13;
but I was sort of working with the task managers, and I was doing all of that. I did that for a&#13;
while.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                               June 16,17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                   76&#13;
&#13;
Let's see, what happened next?&#13;
&#13;
By this time, I had started to do some work, even when I was in the old division-one of the&#13;
things I was always intrigued with was the enormous cultural assets of the countries that I&#13;
worked in. In the old city of Vilnius, extraordinarily beautiful old places with structures going&#13;
back centuries, and similarly in the other communities, beautiful old churches and things. The&#13;
communists, for all of their faults and all of the unfortunate strategies that they pursued, they did&#13;
support the arts. They supported music and dance and the rest of it, and they also took pride in&#13;
structures and whatnot. So a lot of that had been preserved under communism, and the arts were&#13;
given a lot of attention. All the great leaders of the Bolshoi had come from Georgia, for&#13;
example, and things like that. And St. Petersburg and all the great things in Russia had been&#13;
done under communism. Well, St. Petersburg goes back before that, obviously.&#13;
&#13;
So I figured, you know, I'm supposed to be in charge of municipal and social development, and&#13;
municipal development involves not only the things that we were doing in water and all the rest,&#13;
but it also involved making sure that some of this heritage is preserved so that it doesn't, in the&#13;
influx of capitalism, result in all of the McDonald's restaurants on the comers.&#13;
&#13;
So I started out with the city of Vilnius, which was really enchanting. It was very curious&#13;
because it had been called the "Jerusalem of the North." This is the city to which all the Jews&#13;
after the pogroms in 1902, from Russia, congregated.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This is Vilnius?&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Vilnius, in Lithuania. It was called the Jerusalem of the North. It became the&#13;
intellectual center of Judaism in Eastern Europe in the 1900s. There was a large Jewish quarter&#13;
with museums and theaters and education institutions and elite people. They really gave just a&#13;
marvelous flavor to the country. It was still-when I was there, of course, this is after Hitler and&#13;
everything else, there were still remnants of the Jewish quarter, and I felt that there should be&#13;
some way to protect that and to try to see whether we couldn't bring it together with a very strong&#13;
Catholic heritage that existed in Lithuania, and see whether we could preserve that old town.&#13;
&#13;
So I managed to get a $500,000 grant from the Bank. The Bank provided those things in those&#13;
days. This was to set up a planning mechanism in the city of Vilnius that would do a couple of&#13;
things. It would help them establish a zoning regime, as well as a zoning regime with some&#13;
incentives, very careful incentives for investment in properties. But there would be mechanisms&#13;
for vetting alL of these proposals, so that they would be consistent with the traditions of the old&#13;
town. It was meant to be-l tried to capture the spirit of the old town and preserve the fronts&#13;
through zoning so that it wouldn't be defiled, but yet you would not block private investment&#13;
because private investment is essential to reinvigorating a community like that. So that was the&#13;
strategy.&#13;
&#13;
The money was useful in mobilizing the local officials. I spent a lot of time with the archbishop&#13;
who was there. Although there had been a lot of very, very deep feeling, an animosity between&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                 June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 77&#13;
&#13;
the Catholics and the Jews going back to Hitler's times, because the Catholics collaborated with&#13;
the Germans in getting rid of the Jews ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This is Orthodox or Eastern, right? Or Roman?&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: This is Eastern Orthodox, although there was a small Roman presence as well.&#13;
St. John's University in New York had been working with the archbishop. So I found two priests&#13;
and nuns there who I brought down to Washington, and they were helping me with the dialogue&#13;
with the Catholic side.&#13;
&#13;
We had the municipal side pretty well covered, but my problem was, how do you get the Jews&#13;
involved, because most of the Jews had gone either to Israel or to the United States, and the few&#13;
that were left were very suspicious of someone like me coming in there and trying to do this.&#13;
They said, "What the hell are you trying-you're a goyim. What is your interest in doing this?"&#13;
&#13;
I'd try to explain to them. And some of them said, "Well, maybe it's," you know, "maybe it's a&#13;
good idea."&#13;
&#13;
So they were clearly divided. Then, one time on a trip to Europe-these are in the days when we&#13;
wen:: still traveling first class, and we could get an automatic upgrade to the Concorde. So I&#13;
would take that whenever I could because I could get over there and back fast, and it was really&#13;
nice service, even though it was a smaller plane, and you were cramped a little bit. So I sat next&#13;
to a very interesting woman on the way from New York to Paris. Her name was Phyllis&#13;
Lambert. She's an architect who had studied at the University of Chicago. And she turned out to&#13;
be the sister ofEdgar Bronfman. And Edgar Bronfman was the president ofthe World Jewish&#13;
Congress, based in Montreal. And through her, I started opening some doors.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: I can imagine.&#13;
&#13;
BL][NKHORN: So we had a major conference. We went through a competitive process to hire&#13;
some really good planners using that money. We got a team from Sweden, and then we brought&#13;
all the actors and their counterparts together, and we got the agreement on the zoning and&#13;
everything else, and it was just beautiful.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: What year was this?&#13;
&#13;
BL][NKHORN: This was, it must have been '97-'96, '97. Then there was an election in the&#13;
city of Vilnius, and the mayor and everyone else, of course, they're going out and the new group&#13;
came in. Everything stopped. Everything absolutely stopped. I was very disappointed, although&#13;
when I went back to Vilnius many years later, I was very pleased to discover that the old town&#13;
had been preserved beautifully. It was really lovely.&#13;
&#13;
Anyway, that experience inspired me to start doing some other cultural restoration. In those&#13;
days, there was something called a "learning innovation loan." It was a very, very flexible&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                    Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                               June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                               78&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
instrument. A country could borrow up to $5 million, and the whole idea was to demonstrate the&#13;
validity of ideas for change, whether it's in agriculture or whatever, and it was meant to be on a&#13;
fast track. No two years of analysis and all of that. "You get it done in about six months, and we&#13;
expect that you're going to make mistakes, and we expect that you're going to learn from those&#13;
mistakes."&#13;
&#13;
I loved that. This was so exciting to me. So I started going after the LILs, as they call them-L-&#13;
I-L-LIL. I got the first one for Georgia. So we put together a cultural heritage project for&#13;
Georgia. The experience in Georgia was infectious. Azerbaijan applied for one. Romania heard&#13;
about it, and Romania wanted one. Pretty soon ECA-Europe-Central Asia-was way the hell&#13;
out in front of the band, or starting to be, with cultural development.&#13;
&#13;
One day I got a call from the president's office. Did I tell you this story?&#13;
&#13;
GRI\THWOL: No.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: "Mr. Wolfensohn would like to have you come up right away." So I went over&#13;
to his conference room, and he is in there with all the vice presidents and he is on a rampage.&#13;
He's storming-they're all sitting down and he's just ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: He was apparently good at rampages.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Ooh. "You bastards, if I've told you once, I've told you ten times, I want&#13;
culture on the agenda of this 'organization. I told you when I came on two years ago and not a&#13;
goddamned thing has been done. What in the-and you, [M.] Ismail Serageldin, you're&#13;
supposed to be the Vice President for Culture and Special Programs and what the hell have you&#13;
done?" [Inaudible]&#13;
&#13;
"Well, Jim, we're trying."&#13;
&#13;
"No, that's not-I know we have conferences and we have these speeches and everything, but I&#13;
want action. I want action."&#13;
&#13;
He :said, "Well, we do have action, Jim."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Where? Where?"&#13;
&#13;
"Blinkhorn over there. He just came in."&#13;
&#13;
"Who's Blinkhorn?" He said, "Who's Blinkhorn?"&#13;
&#13;
I said, "I'm Blinkhorn."&#13;
&#13;
"What are you doing?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 79&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Well, I'll tell you what I'm doing." I said, "I have a project underway in Georgia, and I'm&#13;
just starting one in Romania, and we did this and did that."&#13;
&#13;
"You are on my new Cultural Council, and we're having a meeting on Thursday, and I want you&#13;
there at 10 o'clock because Yo-Yo Ma and the Aga Khan are going to be there, and we're going&#13;
to talk about how we're going to collaborate in cultural development."&#13;
&#13;
So Serageldin was so impressed with that, he said, "You have to come and work for me."&#13;
&#13;
I said to Serageldin, "Look, I'll help you out, Ismail, but I'm not going to go over there and work&#13;
in that snake pit. I'm very happy in ECA."&#13;
&#13;
He said, "Well, can't you divide your time between now because Jim wants us to do a big paper&#13;
for the Board on a strategy for culture and development, and he's giving a speech and he wants to&#13;
do this. He's inviting the Aga Khan" and blah, blah, blah, blah.&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Okay, give me an office." So I had an office here and one over there, and I would divide&#13;
my time and help Serageldin with the paper.&#13;
&#13;
Me2mwhile, the Romania project started getting on the front burner. It so happened that one of&#13;
Jim Wolfensohn's closest friends, Lois de Menil, her husband was an economic adviser to the&#13;
president of Romania, and she's an old very wealthy woman, with houses in New York and Paris&#13;
and everywhere else, and knew Wolfensohn from New York. And she sent him a private letter&#13;
saying that, "The government of Romania really is interested in this idea of a cultural heritage&#13;
project. I hear that a mission is about to come, and I am so delighted. I hope that you will&#13;
support it.",&#13;
&#13;
And Wolfensohn then became very interested in the Romania project, so interested that as I was&#13;
about to go embark on my first appraisal mission, I get another call from Wolfensohn's office.&#13;
He said, "You have to come over here. There's a communication from Prince Charles."&#13;
&#13;
So I go over there, and he said, "Blinkhorn, here. Take a look at this."&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This is Wolfensohn?&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: This is Wolfensohn. And I'm reading this. Prince Charles, hearing through the&#13;
grapevine, that "you're doing a cultural heritage project in Romania, looking at the restoration of&#13;
the famous Sculptural Ensemble by Constantin Brancusi at Targu Jiu. That's great. I'm very&#13;
happy to do that, but I have these historic villages in Transylvania-Saxon villages-with the&#13;
most beautiful landscapes and cultural heritage, blah, blah going back to the 12th century and my&#13;
St. James Trust is very interested in working with the World Bank and the World Monument&#13;
Fund to do something there. Can you please help us out?"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                 80&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
"Put that in the project."&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This is on your list.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: This is on your list.&#13;
&#13;
So suddenly the project is not just this little-it's "Make sure that there's something in there for&#13;
Prince Charles." And throughout the whole process of preparing the project, getting it approved,&#13;
these letters were going back and forth between Jim and Prince Charles.&#13;
&#13;
Of course, Wolfensohn was the kind of person-he loved this kind of notoriety, go and see the&#13;
Queen and have dinner with this prince or the Aga Khan. And Yo-Yo Ma did come, and I was&#13;
asked to go out to Central Asia to Uzbekistan-Bukhara-to look at what we could do out there.&#13;
&#13;
I mean, this was going crazy, but he was getting himself in big trouble because he was doing this&#13;
without the Board's approval. When the Board caught-they would see a little project for&#13;
Georgia, cultural heritage, and then they started Â·seeing all these other things coming up. They&#13;
said, "Wait a minute. What the hell is this? We don't have any-why are we into culture?"&#13;
&#13;
And a lot of country directors were starting to complain. "Why is the Bank doing this? We're&#13;
doing everything else. We're doing women, we're doing environment, we're doing this, we're&#13;
doing that. Why are we taking on culture now?"&#13;
&#13;
So Wolfensohn and Serageldin had to do a lot of backpedaling fast to put together a strategy&#13;
paper to justify lending to cultural heritage. This is after several loans had been made, not only&#13;
inECA ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Commitments are out.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, they're out there. And guys were seeing what I was doing, and I was&#13;
having fun with it. I was getting calls from guys in Asia and Latin America, "Oh, we're going to&#13;
do one, too, you know." Pretty soon there's a big pipeline coming in because it is a lot of fun.&#13;
It's a lot more fun than doing garbage collection.&#13;
&#13;
So then the paper had to be written, various iterations back and forth. Finally, through a lot of&#13;
painful negotiation and discussion, Wolfensohn got his way and the Board concluded that we&#13;
would only do cultural heritage-lending for cultural heritage-one, ifthe country wanted it;&#13;
two,, if we did it in partnership with organizations that had expertise in this area because we're&#13;
not going to be hiring all kinds of staff, art historians. Fortunately, I was twinned with the World&#13;
Monuments Fund inN ew York, and they had lots of these kinds of people all over the world, and&#13;
they made it available. So I was able to say, "Well, we're working, and there's our partner, and&#13;
they've put in about $2 million into this." So it quickly became a $10 million project, with all&#13;
kinds of other projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  81&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Quick question. Were you involved in preparing the paper for the Board?&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: I wasn't directly involved. That was done by Serageldin and Tia [Kreszentia&#13;
M.] Duer-D -u-e-r-and a couple of other people, but I was very much involved in vetting it,&#13;
making suggestions on the drafts and all the rest of it because I was actually doing the work.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Right. So then back to this pairing with organizations that you were talking&#13;
about.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: So the first one, the country has to ask for it; it has to be in partnership with&#13;
organizations that know what they're doing; it has to be part of a broader strategy for the country.&#13;
That means that it's just not culture for culture's sake. You're not just going to save a church and&#13;
then walk away. You have to have community engagement. You have to do your social&#13;
analysis. You have to make sure that there is effort made to generate income activities that will&#13;
help sustain these restored things.&#13;
&#13;
And so we had to hire teams of social scientists--! was doing that anyway from the University of&#13;
Bucharest, to go into these communities and find out who's living there. One of the exciting&#13;
aspects of this for me in these villages-we picked four or five villages that we actually did&#13;
restoration work in ...&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: These are the Saxon villages now?&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, Saxon villages. And the one Prince Charles was working with us, and his&#13;
St. James Trust, was the village ofViscri-&#13;
V -i-s-c-r-i. In that village was a very young, dynamic, energetic Saxon woman who was the&#13;
mayor of this tiny, little farming village-beautiful village, way back off the road, an hour off&#13;
the road, back in the hills, just glorious. And her name is Carolina Femolend. She spoke&#13;
English, broken, but she was dynamite. She was a Saxon. She had German relatives. A lot of&#13;
Germans used to live there, and they moved away. There are also gypsies in this part of&#13;
Romania-"Roma" as they call them-and Hungarians. She had managed to form a cooperativeÂ·&#13;
of the local women-gypsies and others-and they were doing little things like helping each&#13;
other milk cows, knit socks and things, in hopes that they would make money because the church&#13;
was the big thing for them. They wanted to save their church.&#13;
&#13;
So we came along and all of a sudden all kinds of opportunities started opening up. I arranged&#13;
for c:m organization in Connecticut called the Aid to Artisans, which I had heard had done a lot of&#13;
work with crafts people in developing countries. I invited the head of it, Tom Aageson, to come&#13;
to a seminar that we were organizing in Washington to talk about the experience with helping&#13;
poor villagers in poor countries improve the quality oftheir products and looking at income-&#13;
generating activities: tourism and craft development, cultural art. So he came down.&#13;
&#13;
I had also heard that in New Hampshire-in Meriden, New Hampshire-there was a man by the&#13;
name of Eric O'Leary, who was a well-known sculptor who was doing work with poor Mexican&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                     Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                      82&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
villages, getting their pottery improved and trying to get lead out so that he could sell it in the&#13;
United States. So I invited him to come down.&#13;
&#13;
We had a great conference. I invited Aageson and Aid to Artisans to come to Romania to work&#13;
with local NGOs, and they would help the women in these villages improve the quality oftheir&#13;
product, talk about how they could sell it, for what price, blah, blah, blah. And he then, with the&#13;
Romanian NGO, managed to get them a booth at the Frankfurt Crafts Fair and the New York&#13;
Crafts Fair. They were so successful that their products are now in Crate &amp; Barrel catalogues&#13;
and several others. They are doing very well. They've built bed and breakfasts. If you ever&#13;
want a magnificent vacation, you go to the Saxon villages of Transylvania.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: That's quite something.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Marvelous. I have sent many, many people to Romania. In fact, I am going to&#13;
lead a Dartmouth tour to Romania in 2010 and go back to these places. I just love that country,&#13;
and I love Georgia as well.&#13;
&#13;
So it turned out well. Prince Charles had a conference in London and invited Carolina to come,&#13;
invited me to come and a lot of Romanians, and we had a great time. I got to know him. He's a&#13;
really, really marvelous man. She gave a beautiful speech. It was really a nice experience.&#13;
&#13;
Then, I got a film maker by the name of Allen Moore, from Baltimore, who worked with Ken&#13;
Burns on the Civil War series. I had known him through some other connections. I got Bonnie&#13;
Burnham, the president of the World Monuments Fund, to hire Allen to make a film of the&#13;
restoration ofthe famous Constantin Brancusi Ensemble at Targu Jiu, the history of it, how it&#13;
came about, how the communists tried to tear down and how it's been restored. I use that film in&#13;
my lectures at Dartmouth. I brought Bonnie up to the Hood Museum in Hanover to talk about&#13;
the Vvorld Monuments Fund.&#13;
&#13;
So that was sort of a nice way to close out my career, actually. I was retired, but they kept me on&#13;
as the task manager, and I stayed with the project through many changes of government in&#13;
Romania. I did the project completion report. I thought it went very well, despite a lot of-we&#13;
had a lot of problems with the major contractors, which I don't necessarily have to get into. So&#13;
that, to me, was a very, very exciting experience, and I'm going to use it in this book I'm doing.&#13;
&#13;
I also during this period got involved in the Global Development Learning Network, the GDLN.&#13;
That happened, I don't know quite how it came about. I think by this time I had been in Kevin&#13;
[M.] Cleaver's department, and I was in ECSSD [Environmentally and Socially Sustainable&#13;
Development Sector Unit], which is the social development division in that department. One&#13;
day, Kevin came to me and said, "Jim Wolfensohn has started this Global Development Learning&#13;
Network, using interactive video and all that stuff, and he wants to make this sort of a big deal,&#13;
with UN satellites and whatnot. He has written to the prime minister of Canada to ask him if&#13;
Canada would not finance a center in Ukraine. They said yes. Ken has just come back with $2&#13;
million, and we don't know what to do with it. Will you take it?" It was that kind of thing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                      Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn&#13;
                                 June 16, 17 and 18, 2008-Final Edited&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                                  83&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
I said, "Of course."&#13;
&#13;
So I suddenly found myself, as my Romania was winding down, I started getting involved in the&#13;
GDLN, the Global Development Learning Network, and I took on the project with Canadian&#13;
money. We managed the money and helped establish a GDLN center in Kiev. Then that&#13;
experience led to establishing one at the University of Warsaw. Then I got involved in&#13;
establishing others in Russia, the Balkans, and whatnot. I was doing this while I was a&#13;
consultant. I was retired by then.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: This is after '99.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes, yes, yes. That went on until 2003 or thereabouts. Then, at that stage, we&#13;
decided to move to Hanover, where Betsy and I had two small children. It was after 9/11. The&#13;
sniper attacks really had a really chilling effect on us. We had the prospect of educating our&#13;
children, and that was going to be expensive. Laura and Patrick went to private school in the&#13;
District. For a variety of reasons, we wanted to move to a smaller community. So we went up to&#13;
Hanover, where Betsy had grown up.&#13;
&#13;
And then a year or so ago, I was asked by the GDLN to do an evaluation of the GDLN centers in&#13;
Africa. I did that. It was almost a year long. Then I'm helping out with other kinds of&#13;
consulting activities from time to time, like tsunami packages in Indonesia.&#13;
&#13;
I like to stay in touch with the Bank, from time to time, as a consultant because I really love the&#13;
Bank. I believe it's a great institution. It's gone through a lot of different painful changes and&#13;
still will do so, but I think what it's trying to do is very honorable, and I am very happy to have&#13;
been part of it.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Very Â£OOd. I think that probably does it for us. I'm conscious of the time as&#13;
well.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Yes.&#13;
&#13;
GRATHWOL: Well, thank you very much. I've enjoyed it.&#13;
&#13;
BLINKHORN: Well, thank you, Bob. It's nice meeting you.&#13;

            In June 2008, Thomas Ambrose Blinkhorn
            was interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives
