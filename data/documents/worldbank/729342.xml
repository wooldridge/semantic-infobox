            Private participation in telecommunications

            More than ninety developing economies
            opened their telecommunications sector to private
            participation between 1990 and 1998. These countries
            transferred to the private sector the operating or
            construction risk, or both, of more than 500 projects,
            attracting investment commitments of US$214 billion.
            Two-thirds of that amount has been invested in expanding and
            modernizing networks; the other third has gone to
            governments as divestiture revenues or license fees. The
            investment shows three main trends: Latin America is in the
            lead. Private participation takes place in increasingly
            competitive market structures. And divestitures and
            greenfield projects outnumber operations and management contracts.
