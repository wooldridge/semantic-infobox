This report is based on the findings of an Appraisal mission comprising of Messrs./Mmes.&#13;
Cunningham (Task Manager), Barber, Fraquaharson, Grijsen, van Hoves, Dutt, Dass, and Abbi&#13;
(Consultants) which visited India in September/October 1994 and was joined part-time by&#13;
Messrs./Ms. Matthews. Mei Xie and Robelus (IDA). The mission was also joined part-time by an&#13;
ODA (UK) team consisting of Messrs. Jackson and Robson (ODA) and Messrs. Hull and&#13;
Sunderland (consultants). The institutional and organizational aspects of the project were further&#13;
elaborated in 1995 with assistance of specialists from DGIS (The Netherlands) and ODA. The&#13;
project preparation was also assisted by Messrs/Mmes. Oblitas, Fauss, J.R. Malhotra, A.&#13;
Subramanian, Myint, Estoque and Abedin (Bank) and Kraatz and Hasan (FAO). The Peer&#13;
Reviewers of the project were Messrs./Mmes. Crooks, Robelus (environmental aspects);&#13;
Frederiksen (irrigation); Matthews (informatics); Smith (general water resources) Ms. Mei Xie&#13;
(hydrology) and Radha Singh (institutional aspects). Mr. Vergin, Director (SA2DR) and Mr.&#13;
Shawki Barghouti, Division Chief (SA2AW) have endorsed the project.&#13;

Estimation of Project Costs&#13;
1.    Implementation Schedule. The project implementation phasing for each project agency with&#13;
the work program phasing for each project agency is detailed in Table I of the respective annexes.&#13;
The relatively heavy programs during the first three years of the project reflect that a large&#13;
proportion of the instrumentation and associated works will be procured and installed during that&#13;
period. During the latter part of the project life, the work program mainly relates to consolidating&#13;
the institutional strengthening activities and the initial O&amp;M related to the data collection and&#13;
operation of the data management systems. Most of the computing facilities will be procured early&#13;
in the project period.&#13;
2.    Project Cost Estimates are based on information provided by central and state organizations&#13;
participating in the project. The project costs are summarized by main activity and by project&#13;
agencies in Table 3 of Annex 1. Expenditures by component/activity and responsible agency are&#13;
detailed in Table I of this Annex. The cost estimates for each of the national agencies and&#13;
participating states are detailed in Table 1 of the respective annexes, broken down into surface&#13;
water and groundwater components and by capital and recurrent costs.&#13;
3.    Unit Costs. Standard unit costs have been adopted for all appropriate equipment and&#13;
works items and for their associated recurrent costs. To simplify cost tables, standard packages of&#13;
equipment and/or works have been used to make up items such as gauging station configurations&#13;
and equipment ancillaries, current metering sets, reservoir sedimentation equipment, and various&#13;
computer packages. These standard unit costs and packages are shown in Table 2 of this Annex&#13;
with some items described in more detail in paras 6 to 9 below.&#13;
4.    Foreign Exchange Cost. The foreign exchange cost element of the project represents the&#13;
cost, net of Indian taxes, of goods and services of overseas origin procured directly by the project&#13;
or purchased from an Indian importer. Indirect foreign exchange costs (the cost of foreign&#13;
components and materials in Indian made goods) have not been included.&#13;
5.    Taxes and Duties. Calculation of the weighted tax element of project costs has been based&#13;
on the following assumptions: (a) staff salaries and allowances, consultants, training, software&#13;
support 0.0%; computers, peripherals and software - 12.0%; and other equipment, vehicles,&#13;
materials - 10.0%. The operating costs of computerized data centers assume zero tax and are&#13;
based on standard computer packages and include software support with hardware maintenance&#13;
and consumables. For equipment packages with items in more than one of the tax categories, the&#13;
predominant items are used to determine tax rates. In practice tax rates vary considerably within&#13;
these categories and from state to state. Thus apart from computers, the cost of imported equipment&#13;
are based mainly on prices reported in India and these are assumed to include taxes. With the&#13;
above assumptions, the estimated total of taxes and duties is about US$ 4.0 million.&#13;
6.    Data Management Systems. The packages of computing equipment to be provided at data&#13;
centers have been standardized. A full list of computers, software and ancillary equipment to be&#13;
supplied to each type of data center and other costs are detailed in Sections 2.31 to 2.36 of Table 1&#13;
to this Annex. The cost estimates for all computers and software make an allowance of 50% of the&#13;
original cost in year six of the project to allow for system replacements and upgrades.&#13;
7.    It is assumed that basic items of equipment, which are currently available in India, are&#13;
procured locally, and other equipment and software is imported. Imported equipment cost is based&#13;
on the international price (US/UK retail price), plus 20% for additional handling and shipping,&#13;
plus taxes. Equipment of Indian origin is priced at local market levels which, for computers, is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 2&#13;
approximately double the UK price. However, if computers are procured under ICB, then it is&#13;
likely that Indian manufacturers will be able to obtain additional tax benefits and supply equipment&#13;
at internationally competitive prices. Computer operating costs include an annual on-site&#13;
maintenance contract costed at 12.5% of the cost of computers and printers.&#13;
8.     Computer Software. The cost of specialist hydrological software is based on costs&#13;
provided by Institute of Hydrology (IOH), UK, and the Delft Hydraulics Laboratory, Holland. In&#13;
addition a sum is allowed for consumables and stationary and for support from overseas for&#13;
specialist hydrological software. The latter is based on estimates for IOH.&#13;
9.    Buildings. A lump sum has been allocated for up-grading buildings for computer centers&#13;
Types A and B (Rs. 200,000) and C and D (Rs. 100,000). These allowances are not included for&#13;
the Type D centers installed in laboratories and where the project constructs new buildings that&#13;
would accommodate the computing equipment.&#13;
10.   Equipment and Scientific Training Equipment. Standard packages of training and scientific&#13;
equipment are included for all State surface water and groundwater organizations . A mini-bus for&#13;
transport of trainees is included for most State surface water organizations.&#13;
Institutional Support and Strengthening.&#13;
11.   A substantial amount of the project work program will be carried out departmentally or by&#13;
force account. Incremental costs to the agencies related to these activities have been estimated in&#13;
terms of costs for incremental staffing salaries and allowances, O&amp;M of facilities, additional&#13;
transportation costs and other routine recurrent costs. Generally all incremental institutional costs&#13;
during the first three years of the project (until March 31, 1999) are related to implementation of&#13;
the various work programs, training and initial testing the works and equipment installed. Thus.&#13;
the recurrent and incremental O&amp;M expenditures are assumed to commence in the forth year of the&#13;
project (i.e., after March 31. 1999).&#13;
12.   The project generally improves or strengthens the total program of the units in the agencies&#13;
responsible for implementing the project and thus directly will involve all existing staff. All these&#13;
agencies have budgetary provisions for existing data collection and processing activities, and for&#13;
administrative overheads. The incremental recurrent costs to implement and manage the project&#13;
activities is on average about a third of the present annual recurrent costs in present value tenns. In&#13;
the first three years of the project, the disbursement percentage against these incremental recurrent&#13;
costs will be 90 percent. By the beginning of the forth year,most of the implementation activities&#13;
will be completed and the agencies will mainly undertake routine O&amp;M of the expanded networks&#13;
and data processing facilities. The incremental O&amp;M costs associated with upgrading and&#13;
improvement to the existing networks and facilities under the project will, on average, increase the&#13;
current recurrent O&amp;M budgets by about 35 percent. Thus, the project also support the incremental&#13;
recurrent costs (mainly O&amp;M of completed works and facilities) on a declining scale as follows:&#13;
(a) 90% of incremental recurrent costs up to March 31. 1999; (b) 75% up to March 31, 2000, and&#13;
(c) 50% thereafter under project completion..&#13;
13.   Standard packages of office equipment are provided and office operating costs include an&#13;
allowance for equipment maintenance. Office operating costs are provided for those offices that&#13;
have been newly established for the project, or substantially improved under the project, and&#13;
therefore an incremental O&amp;M cost. The numbers of incremental staff and the related costs were&#13;
primarily obtained from state proposals. The staff numbers and salary and allowance costs are&#13;
detailed in the project proposals prepared by each of the national agencies and participating state.&#13;
The costs have been collated and summarized in the Table 1 of the Annex for each project agency .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 2&#13;
Page 3&#13;
14.   The following assumptions have also been made to estimate the incremental O&amp;M costs:&#13;
(a) 3.5% of the capital cost from the year following procurement for maintenance of river&#13;
gauging stations and equipment, meteorological stations, and groundwater monitoring&#13;
equipment. (This figure is low since many standard equipment packages include an&#13;
installation cost and the equipment will all be relatively new during the project period).&#13;
(b) One percent of capital cost from the year following construction has been included for&#13;
maintenance of new buildings.&#13;
(c) An annual operating cost of reservoir survey equipment of 5% of capital cost for&#13;
maintenance, plus 10% of capital for fuel and consumables. (This equates to about Rs.&#13;
0.9 million per equipment package per year).&#13;
(d) Operating costs of Rs. 60,000 per year for vehicles and Rs. 4,000 per year for&#13;
motorcycles.&#13;
(e) An annual maintenance cost of wireless equipment at 5% of capital cost.&#13;
(f) An annual cost of consumables for water quality laboratories at Rs. 10,000 for level 1,&#13;
Rs. 50,000 for level II, Rs. 150,000 for level II+, and Rs. 350,000 for level III.&#13;
(Equipment maintenance for level I is included in this lump sum, while an annual&#13;
allowance of 5% of equipment costs is included for levels II and M.)&#13;
(g) 25% of the cost of the laboratory equipment at any level is made in the sixth year of the&#13;
project to cover any equipment items requiring replacement or major overhaul.&#13;
15.   Training. The training costs were estimated be generating a unit rate for each training&#13;
course as summarized Table 1 of Annex 10). These unit rates were then used to calculate the costs&#13;
for the proposed training programs for each organization participating in the project.&#13;
16.   CWC and CGWB Training Institutes. The base cost estimates of the CWC (Table 1,&#13;
Annex 15) of some Rs. 33.0 million for building and some training equipment for their proposed&#13;
National Water Academy to be established at Pune. Similarly, the base cost estimate for the&#13;
CGWB (Table 1, Annex 16) includes a lump sum of Rs. 91.0 million for the construction and&#13;
provision of equipment for the National Institute of Groundwater Research and Training. Both&#13;
cost estimates are based on detailed proposals prepared by the respective agencies. A provision has&#13;
been made to fmance some of the operating and staff costs of both Institutes.&#13;
Physical and Price Contingencies and Deflation.&#13;
17.   Physical contingencies have been applied to allow for possible variations in the physical&#13;
quantity and design, and the unit prices assumed for works and goods as follows: 10% of works,&#13;
equipment and incremental recurrent costs, 5% for training activities, and zero for consultancies&#13;
and R&amp;D activities. In this respect, the physical contingencies applied to the incremental recurrent&#13;
costs makes allowance for: (a) variations in the assumed incremental staffing levels; (b) the grades&#13;
of staff employed; (c) variations due to salary increases over the project period to staff who have&#13;
successfully completed specialist training; and (d) variations in the unit costs of O&amp;M activities&#13;
used to generate routine O&amp;M costs for project facilities, works and equipment. Price&#13;
contingencies of 3.0% in 1994, 1.5% in 1995, 1.8% in 1996, 2.6% in 1997, and 2.5% thereafter&#13;
were applied to the foreign exchange component. For local costs, price contingencies were added&#13;
at 10.0% in 1994, 9.0% in 1995, 8.5% in 1996, and 8.0% in 1997, 7.0% in 1998, and 6.0%&#13;
thereafter. The project costing also take into account the expected changes in the currency&#13;
equivalent over the project period as follows: 1994 - Rs 31.4/US$; 1995 - 32.3/US$; 1996 -&#13;
34.81US$; 1997 - 37.4/US$; 1998 - 39.81US$; 1999 - 42.0/US$; and 2000 - 44.3/US$.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Improvements to Surface Water Observation Systems&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    This annex examines the present status of surface water hydrometry in the NP project area&#13;
and reviews the current practices for data collection, processing and validation. It then goes on to&#13;
describe the proposed improvements to the hydrometric networks and data processing systems&#13;
under the project. The institutional requirements and training needs for improvement of the&#13;
hydrometric services are described in Annexes 9 and 10 respectively of this report, and more&#13;
specifically in the Annexes describing the CWC component (Annex 15) and the individual state&#13;
components (Annexes 20-26). Improved data management and communication systems to be&#13;
provided by the project are described in Annex 7 of this report.&#13;
A. Background and Present Situation&#13;
DeveloRment of Surface Water Observation Systems&#13;
2.    Since the mid- 19th century, development of surface water in India has been led by the need&#13;
to create large public sector irrigation schemes to secure and increase food supplies to support the&#13;
growing population. Planning and design of large river diversion structures, their appurtenant&#13;
canal systems and irrigation command areas, and any reservoir facilities constructed to support&#13;
these facilities required knowledge of the hydrological characteristics of the rivers on which they&#13;
were placed. Thus, surface water measurement sites were located originally for project planning&#13;
and design purposes, and measurements were often discontinued after this short-term objective&#13;
had been achieved. Some early network were established on major rivers mainly for flood waming&#13;
purposes and often observed only the river stages.&#13;
3.    Historically, the networks were not designed to evaluate the surface water resources of a&#13;
basin or sub-basin. While water resources were abundant and relatively uncommitted, this lack of&#13;
total resource information had little consequence. But as levels of surface water development&#13;
increased and conflicts between riparian states and users in the basins have emerged, the need for&#13;
such information has grown. Unfortunately, the state river gauging networks generally have not&#13;
developed to meet the needs of basin water resource evaluation or to support basin water planning&#13;
and management. Moreover, the common occurrence of shared basins between states, the status of&#13;
water as a state subject, and the over-riding interest of state agencies in construction of projects&#13;
have mitigated against basin planning and the development of state stream gauging networks for&#13;
this purpose.&#13;
4.    With the creation of the Central Water and Power Commission (CWPC) in 1950, a national&#13;
organization had a mandate for surface water resource evaluation and management and to provide&#13;
flood warning services among its other defined duties. In response to these requirements, CWPC&#13;
and its successor, Central Water Commission (CWC), established an organization for collection&#13;
and evaluation of surface water data. CWC now operates networks of hydrometric stations on all&#13;
the major rivers of India. Though the observation sites are generally located with a view to basin&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 2&#13;
resource evaluation, their density is sparse and inadequate for modern needs without&#13;
complementary data from state networks.&#13;
5.    The early interest in surface water hydrometry was concerned almost entirely with water&#13;
quantity. Water quality was determined through limited observations and then only with regard to&#13;
the project use to which the water would be applied. Sediment loads attracted little interest&#13;
excepting at the design stage of dams. However, the last twenty years has witnessed a gradual&#13;
increase in water quality and sediment monitoring in the CWC networks and in some of the state&#13;
networks. But the information generated is inadequate, particularly with regard to water quality&#13;
data in respect of present needs for pollution control and environrmental protection.&#13;
6.    Existing Hydrometric Networks. Within the eight participating states, but excluding the&#13;
Ganges basin area in Madhya Pradesh and the Narmada basin area in Madhya Pradesh,&#13;
Maharashtra and Gujarat, the CWC operates 235 river gauging stations where stage/discharge&#13;
observations are made. Water quality observations are made at 131 of the stations and suspended&#13;
sediments are monitored at 121 of the stations. In the same area, the state surface water agencies&#13;
operate 776 stage/discharge stations of which only 30 also monitor water quality and 241 monitor&#13;
sediment loads. A breakdown of networks by state area, operating agency and observations made&#13;
at the sites is shown by Annex 1, Table 1.&#13;
7.   Instrumentation and Ancillary Equipment. All stations are provided with a staff gauge for&#13;
stage measurements and some stations also have float type, autographic water level recorders set in&#13;
a stilling well. Cup type, and occasionally propeller type current meters, are predominantly used&#13;
for flow measurements, and timed float measurements are more rarely used except in times of high&#13;
floods. Arrangements for making current meter measurements vary according to river size and site&#13;
conditions including bridge set-ups, travelling cableways with boat or cradle arrangements, and&#13;
independently powered boats for large rivers. Water depth is measured by sounding rods or by&#13;
echo sounder, as appropriate. Most of the equipment is of Indian origin and of good quality.&#13;
However, the maintenance of equipment and instruments - particularly current meters and pivot&#13;
points -needs to be substantially improved.&#13;
8.    Field Practices and Procedures. The stream gauging stations of CWC and most of the&#13;
participating states are permanently manned with crews that reflect the type of station and the&#13;
equipments used. Additional staff are employed during the flood season. Staff gauge observations&#13;
are made thrice each day during the low flow season and hourly during the monsoon.&#13;
Measurements of discharge are generally made once each day, excepting on Sundays and official&#13;
holidays. The area-velocity method is used for measurements of discharge. Velocities are generally&#13;
measured by cup-type current meters, and depths are measured by echo sounder or by sounding&#13;
rods, although in some cases pre-monsoon cross sections are used. Widths of river segments are&#13;
measured by wading for shallow depths, and by segmentation done by the pivot method for larger&#13;
rivers.&#13;
9.    In theory, the practices for discharge measurements are set according to the Indian Bureau&#13;
of Standards (IBS) and methodologies recommended by the World Meteorological Organization&#13;
(WMO) and the United States Geological Survey. In addition, the CWC and some states (Gujarat,&#13;
Maharashtra) have prepared field manuals based on these procedures. However, inspections have&#13;
revealed a number of deficiencies in actual field practices due to departures from specified standard&#13;
procedures.&#13;
10.   Data Processing. The officer-in-charge at the gauging station - a Junior Engineer or&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 3&#13;
Overseer - has responsibility for recording the raw measurements and the computed discharges&#13;
according to standard formats. After checking for arithmetic errors, the data is forwarded through&#13;
Section and Subdivisional offices where it is further scrutinised, and then transmitted to the&#13;
Divisional office for further checking and finalization. The circle offices of CWC and some state&#13;
surface water agencies publish year books of discharge data for their observation stations. The&#13;
quality control procedures related to data collection and verification need to be substantially&#13;
strengthened.&#13;
I l. Sediment and Water Ouality Data. Sediment samples are collected and analyzed according to&#13;
standard procedures. Simple 'Punjab type' sampling equipment is commonly used. 'The samples&#13;
are analyzed at on-site laboratories which may serve two or three sediment observation stations.&#13;
So-called Level I chemical laboratories (see Annex 5 for details) are located at river gauging sites&#13;
where water quality is monitored to measure certain parameters which must be determined within&#13;
24 hours, such as pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen (DO) and biological oxygen&#13;
demand (BOD). A Level I facility may serve two or three adjacent water quality observation sites.&#13;
Standard analyses of the common chemical parameters are carried out at divisional laboratories of&#13;
CWC and in some state agency laboratories. CWC publishes year books of sediment load and&#13;
water quality data for the observation stations under each of its circle offices.&#13;
B. Proposed Improvements to Surface Water Observation Systems&#13;
Upgrading and Expansion of Observation Networks&#13;
12.   The CWC will not expand its existing network in the participating states of NP (para 6),&#13;
but it will upgrade the existing stations, where necessary, by providing additional equipments and&#13;
structures at some stations and/or replacement equipment and structures at other stations. Details of&#13;
equipment provisions are given in Annex 15. The additional instrumentations include: autographic&#13;
water level recorders; various types of current meters; digital counters for current meters; and&#13;
echosounders for depth measurements. The equipments include a variety of cableways and boat&#13;
sets for current metering. Provisions are made for suspended and bed-load sampling packages,&#13;
and for upgrading of existing and creation of new sediment sampling laboratories. Improvements&#13;
to the water quality data collection system will include provision of 75 new Level I laboratories,&#13;
upgrading of ten divisional laboratories to Level II, the Coimbatore regional laboratory to Level&#13;
II+ and the Hyderabad regional laboratory to Level III (see Annex 5 for details).&#13;
13.   The state surface water agency networks will be improved by upgrading existing stations&#13;
and creation of new stations. The number of stage/discharge measuring stations will increase from&#13;
776 to 1201 locations. Sediment load will also be monitored at 386 of the stations and water&#13;
quality at 211 stations. The distribution of the networks by state area, operating agency and&#13;
observations made at the station is shown by Annex 1, Table 1.&#13;
14. The instruments and ancillary equipments to be provided for the improvements of the state&#13;
agency networks are of similar types to those listed for CWC (para. 12). Facilities for sediment&#13;
sampling and analysis and for water quality monitoring will be improved in all the participating&#13;
states. Details of improvements to the surface water observation systems in the participating states&#13;
are described in detail in the respective Annexes 20-26.&#13;
15. Inventory of Existing Stream Gauging Stations. As noted, both CWC and the states&#13;
operate gauging stations on the same river systems, and the state stations were not necessarily&#13;
located to be complementary to the CWC networks. It is known that some state gauging stations&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 4&#13;
are located in close proximity to CWC stations, and thus one or other of the stations may be&#13;
redundant. In other circumstances, gauging sites are poorly selected for providing accurate&#13;
measurements. Moreover, the equipment and instrumentation provided may be inappropriate for&#13;
obtaining good measurements at a specific site and/or mnay require repair or replacement.&#13;
16.   An important first step before finalizing the programs to upgrade and expand the networks&#13;
would be for CWC and the surface water agency in each state to jointly inspect the gauging&#13;
stations and assess:  (a) need for obtaining measurements at the locality; (b) appropriateness of&#13;
the actual site location for obtaining good stream flow measurements; (c) operational status of the&#13;
installed equipment and replacement/repair requirements; (d) appropriateness of the equipment&#13;
installed and the need for change or upgrading; (e) procedures followed for obtaining stream flow&#13;
measurements and recommended improvements; (f) situation regarding existing or future sediment&#13;
and/or water quality sampling activities at the station; and (g) the quality of the historical record&#13;
from the station.&#13;
17.   The inventory of station specific information would detail the infrastructural and&#13;
measurement procedure related improvements necessary to ensure that stations record reliable data.&#13;
The review process would also identify redundancies in the existing networks. After completion of&#13;
the inventory in each state, it would then be possible to properly plan the upgrading of the existing&#13;
stations and the proposed expansion of the state networks.&#13;
18.   Selection and Design of New Stream Gauging Stations. The WMO gives broad guidelines&#13;
for densities of stream gauging network in terms of area of catchment covered per station. It is&#13;
suggested that there should be one station per 1,000-2,500 km2 in flat regions and one station per&#13;
200-1,000 km2 in hilly and mountainous country. In practice, area specific characteristics actually&#13;
define where gauging stations should be located to properly understand the hydrology of a river&#13;
system within its basin area. The configuration of the river system and its tributaries, and the need&#13;
to have measurements at appropriate locations before flows converge are the main determinants&#13;
that influence network layouts and densities. The need to capture the impact of rainfall distribution&#13;
patterns on the runoff contributions from various parts of a basin also must be taken into account&#13;
in defining an optimum stream gauging network. And gauging stations must be reasonably&#13;
accessible by road.&#13;
19.   Once the general pattern of the stream gauging network and the approximate locations of&#13;
the new gauging stations are decided, it then becomes necessary to select the exact site at which the&#13;
river will be gauged. Site selection considerations include: (a) the stability of the river section; (b)&#13;
the absence of major distortions of flow at the site; (c) the stability of the water surface at each&#13;
stage; (d) the foundation conditions on the river bank if a structure is intended; (e) the availability&#13;
of a bridge from which measurements could be made; and (f) reasonable access to the site for&#13;
positioning a measuring crew and for supervision of measuring activities. The measuring site&#13;
geography and river flow conditions will then decide the types of instrumentation and ancillary&#13;
equipment that will be required for the gauging station.&#13;
20.   Each state surface water agency will be required to follow the above described sequence of&#13;
network planning, final site selection and detailed specification of instrumentation and ancillary&#13;
equipment requirements before undertaking procurement of equipment and works to install new&#13;
gauging stations. Advice will be available from CWC and the project consultants who will also&#13;
review final proposals before implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
Annex 3&#13;
Page 5&#13;
Implementation and Supervision of Measurement Procedures&#13;
21.   Although flow measurement procedures have been well defined and would be appropriate&#13;
if properly followed, actual field procedures depart from the defined standards. In addition,&#13;
instruments and ancillary equipments are not maintained according to laid down standards. Such&#13;
failures result in flow estimates which are of questionable validity. The failures are most apparent&#13;
and widespread in the majority of the state surface water organizations. They demonstrate lack of&#13;
discipline and/or expertise in the measuring crews, and this reflects inadequacies of supervision by&#13;
the professional staff at all levels in the hydrology units. Basic reasons underlying the weaknesses&#13;
of hydrometry in the state organizations are their structure and professional staffing practices&#13;
which do not encourage continuity of service and specialization in hydrology. An important project&#13;
objective will be the creation of free-standing surface water hydrology units which have the&#13;
mandate to develop and retain specialist cadres of professional staff who can regard hydrology as&#13;
an attractive career prospect. This question is discussed further in Annex 9 of the SAR.&#13;
Use of Rating Curves&#13;
22.   As noted in para. 8 above, CWC makes flow estimates by current metering daily (excepting&#13;
Sundays and holidays) at all gauging stations where stage/discharge characteristics are monitored.&#13;
Rating curves derived from stage/discharge relationships are used mainly as a check on the daily&#13;
measurements and to compute flows from observed stages on Sundays and holidays. The state&#13;
organizations follow similar practices and some measure flow twice daily.&#13;
23.   The daily repetition of flow measurements appears to relate to the fact that stage/discharge&#13;
stations are permanently manned to make current meter measurements. But this frequency of flow&#13;
measurement is certainly unnecessary at stable observation sites where secure rating curves can be&#13;
developed, and even fundamentally unstable sites have periods of stability between important&#13;
flood events. Moreover, taking more measurements does not necessarily result in better&#13;
measurements, particularly when supervision is slack, and ill-trained and unmotivated crews are&#13;
employed on repetitious work. An objective of the project will be to encourage development of&#13;
valid rating curves and their more general use in making daily and more frequent flow estimates.&#13;
Each gauging station will require special attention to take account of site specific characteristics.&#13;
Highly trained and supervised current metering crews will be developed and provided with the&#13;
necessary mobility to serve several gauging stations and making the measurements necessary to&#13;
develop secure rating curves for their observation sites. The site crews will concentrate on making&#13;
sufficient stage readings (and/or servicing autographic water level recorders) and carrying out any&#13;
other monitoring activities for which the station is designated. Thus, more reliance will be placed&#13;
on using stage/discharge relationships to derive flow estimates. As a result, it is anticipated that the&#13;
validity of the flow data produced will be enhanced, and some savings in staffing costs for stream&#13;
flow gauging will ensue.&#13;

HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Improvement to Groundwater Observation Systems&#13;
Present Situation&#13;
1.   The CGWB has established a nation-wide network of observation wells at about 16,000&#13;
locations for monitoring groundwater level and groundwater quality changes through time, and about&#13;
8,700 of the monitoring sites are in the eight states participating in the project. The State&#13;
Groundwater Organizations (SGO) of the participating states have developed their own groundwater&#13;
monitoring networks to provide a total of about 19,500 observation sites. Thus, within the project&#13;
area of about 1.74 million km2, groundwater observations are being made at around 27,200 locations,&#13;
giving an average density network of about 62 kM2/site.&#13;
2.    The observation points are predominantly hand-dug, open wells which are not owned by the&#13;
agencies - onlv about 6.0% of all observation points are tubewells. With the exception of a few small&#13;
areas, the networks are designed to monitor the phreatic aquifer systems which provide by far the&#13;
greatest proportion of the groundwater used for irrigation, which in tum uses more than 90% of the&#13;
groundwater abstracted. The open well observation points are chosen to be lightly used, to minimize&#13;
water abstraction effects on the water levels observed. Village drinking water wells form a large&#13;
proportion of the observation networks. The characteristics of the CGWB and SGO networks in the&#13;
participating states are shown by Annex 1, Table 1.&#13;
3.    Water levels in wells are measured manually (using a steel tape or biaxial electric tape),&#13;
excepting at a very few tubewell locations where autographic water levels records have been installed.&#13;
Throughout the CGWB network, water levels are measured during fixed ten-day periods in January,&#13;
May, August and November. SGOs follow individual practices - Tamil Nadu makes monthly&#13;
measurements; in Andhra Pradesh, observation timings by department staff range from twice a year&#13;
(pre-monsoon and post-monsoon) in most of the network to bi-monthly or monthly in a few wells;&#13;
Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh now make measurements four times a year; Gujarat mainly makes&#13;
pre- and post-monsoon measurements; and most of Orissa's and Kerala's networks are measured&#13;
only pre-monsoon.&#13;
4.    The CGWB and most SGOs sample their networks for water quality at the time of level&#13;
measurement immediately prior to the monsoon. Gujarat's SGO samples its main network twice a&#13;
year, and more often in the area of saline water invasion in the Saurashtra.&#13;
Inadequacies of the Existing Networks&#13;
5.    LimitationsQLOpen Wells. The use of privately owned, open wells for water level and water&#13;
quality observations has become an increasing problem. Some now tend to go dry before the end of&#13;
the dry season (due to water level decline in their vicinities) and others fall into disrepair after being&#13;
abandoned by their owners. Both situations can cause the loss of all or part of the record at an&#13;
important observation site. The CGWB has had the intention to gradually replace open well&#13;
observation sites by purpose-built observation tubewells, but has yet to make significant progress in&#13;
this respect. Some of the SGOs are adopting this practice on a small scale. The project provides for&#13;
replacement of key open well observation sites which are becoming problematic by purpose-built&#13;
tubewells which will be owned by the CGWB or the concerned SGO as appropriate.&#13;

6.    Monitoring of Deeper Aquifers. As noted (para 2), the existing networks were designed&#13;
mainly for monitoring the shallow aquifers which support most of the irrigation development. This&#13;
will remain a priority, and provision is made under the project for strengthening these networks as&#13;
necessary by adding new or replacement shallow observation tubewells. However, deeper aquifers&#13;
are being increasingly exploited for riral water supplies, municipal supplies and irrigation. In some&#13;
circumstances, this exploitation is in areas of potential overdraft due to limited resource and/or in&#13;
fragile hydraulic situations with complex water quality relationships adjacent to the coast. In these&#13;
situations, networks of properly designed observation wells are required to monitor piezometric&#13;
relationships and/or water quality changes and relationships in these deeper aquifers. The project&#13;
makes provision for such network improvements.&#13;
7.   Inaccuracy and Infrequency of Water Level Measurements. The present practice of relying&#13;
mainly on manual measurements of water levels in wells can produce data of questionable accuracy&#13;
for a variety of reasons relating to: the diligence of the observer; the measuring instrument used; and&#13;
the fact that a privately owned well may have been in use immediately prior to the measurement being&#13;
made. Of equal importance, the intervals between measurements of levels on the CGWB networks&#13;
and most of the SGO networks (para 3) result, at best, in a very crude hydrograph and, at worst, in a&#13;
poor indication of high and low water levels. The provision by the project of agency-owned,&#13;
purpose-built observation tubewells in the CGWB and SGO networks makes installation of automatic&#13;
water level recorders a practical proposition at appropriate observation sites where reasonable security&#13;
can be assured. The project makes provision for instrumentation for such network improvements.&#13;
8.    Groundwater Qualhity Sampling. The requirements for groundwater level monitoring and for&#13;
water sampling for quality monitoring in an observation well are opposite. The first requires that the&#13;
water levels in the well should be undisturbed by abstraction so that the -level measured indicates the&#13;
piezometric situation in the general area monitored by the observation site. The second requires that&#13;
the sample taken represents the aquifer water at the location, which means that the water in the well&#13;
should be turned over by abstraction to avoid taking a sample of water that has stagnated in the well.&#13;
The use of open wells, which are not owned by the agencies, for monitoring both water levels and&#13;
water quality carries the risk that either or both requirements may be violated.&#13;
Proposed Improvements to the Networks&#13;
9.    The improved CGWB network in the project area would comprise 8,802 observation sites of&#13;
which 6,298 (72%) would be open wells, and 2,504 (28%) would be observation tubewells, and&#13;
1,698 (68%) of the tubewells would be fitted with automatic water level recorders. The state agency&#13;
networks would comprise a total of 22,290 observation sites of which 16,678 (75%) would be open&#13;
wells and 5,612 (25%) would be observation tubewells, and 3,787 (67%) of the tubewells would be&#13;
fitted with water level recorders. Table IB of Annex I shows a summarized breakdown of the above&#13;
totals by state, agency and type of observation site, and presents the existing situation for&#13;
comparison. More detailed descriptions of the actual facilities are given for each state in respective&#13;
Annexes 16 and 20 to 26.&#13;
10.   Observaton Tubewell Design and Construction. A very large proportion of the purpose-built&#13;
observation tubewells will be constructed in hard rock to depths of 30-50-m. Some of the balance&#13;
will be in hard rock to greater depths. The remaining wells will be drilled in alluvial or consolidated&#13;
sedimentary deposits to a range of depths from 30 to 400 mm. As noted (para 15), when digital&#13;
water level recorders are to be fitted on the observation wells, the internal diameter of the completed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
26&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 3&#13;
well need be no longer than 100 mm, (smaller diameters could be used if the construction technology&#13;
is not a constraint) 1.&#13;
11.   The wells will be drilled at a suitable diameter for completion with 100 m ID PVC tubular&#13;
materials. In the case of wells intended for monitoring water levels of phreatic aquifers in hard rock&#13;
systems, the wells could be constructed rapidly and at lowest cost using small down-the-hole-hammer&#13;
equipment. In most cases. such wells would require casing only in the upper part to prevent caving,&#13;
and could be completed in open hole below where the rock is competent enough to stand uncased.&#13;
The observation wells intended to monitor deeper aquifers in hard rock could also be drilled with&#13;
down-the-hole-hammer equipment, but would require casing to total depth with a slotted section&#13;
covering the aquifer. Grouting of casing would be limited to ensuring aquifer isolation when&#13;
essential, and to stabilizing the uppermost section of casing in the drilled hole.&#13;
12.   The observation tubewells to be installed in alluvial or soft sedimentary deposits will be drilled&#13;
using rotary drilling rigs with mud tlush. The wells will be lined to total depth with 100 mm ID PVC&#13;
casing with a slotted section opposite the aquifer to be monitored. In most situations, the&#13;
development process together with collapse of the overlying cut section will provide adequate&#13;
isolation of the aquifer, and grouting will be required only to stabilize the uppermost section of casing&#13;
in the drilled hole.&#13;
13.  Implementation and Procurement of Observation Tubewells. Installation of the observation&#13;
tubewell networks for both the SGO and CGWB regional office programs should be completed in the&#13;
first three years of the project. The size of the programs requires that much of the work may have to&#13;
be carried out by contracts with private drilling companies. This carries little risk if the work is&#13;
properly supervised. Moreover, the private companies have the small down-the-hole-hammer rigs&#13;
which are required for the hard rock well construction which forms the largest part of the programs.&#13;
The agencies may chose to construct part of the programs, particularly the wells with more difficult&#13;
designs, using their own drilling rigs.&#13;
14.   Selection of Automatic Water Level Recorders. An automatic water level recorder (of the&#13;
Leopold and Stevens type), driven by a clock mechanism and with a float vessel in the well, has been&#13;
manufactured in India for many years. These instruments are of relatively low cost and robust.&#13;
However, they have several serious drawbacks, particularly when used on observation tubewells&#13;
which are intended to be visited only at relatively long intervals (though clocks can be fitted to last&#13;
three months or more between windings). The float mechanism normally requires a well internal&#13;
diameter of 150 mm, and even then the float may hang up against the side unless the instrument is&#13;
perfectly centered. The pens have a tendency to dry up. The charts tend to stretch or shrink with&#13;
temperature/humidity changes and then wrinkle or otherwise impede the autographic record. And the&#13;
charts must be interpreted to produce data for entry into the record and transmission to a data bank.&#13;
15.   Responding to a shift in preference to electronic recording instruments for monitoring water&#13;
levels, one Indian manufacturer has been marketing a digital pressure transducer type water level&#13;
recorder for the past several years. Moreover, the SGO of Andhra Pradesh has had satisfactory&#13;
service from 13 of these instruments (adapted to pump test work) for the past four years. The&#13;
instrument is battery powered, and a hand-held electronic device is used to transfer recorded data&#13;
directly from the digitizer to a computer. The battery, which is rechargeable, will keep the instrument&#13;
operating for much more than one month. The price is somewhat higher than the Leopold and&#13;
Stevens type recorder, but the pressure transducer level sensor fits very easily into a well of 100 mm&#13;
I     A 100 mm internal diameter casing has been assumed for costing the observation tubewells.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
27&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 4&#13;
diameter or less, and its position is fixed once installed. A second manufacturer has developed a&#13;
digital instrument with an electronically controlled electric contact sensor, with other characteristics&#13;
similar to those described above.  Moreover, foreign manufacturers of digital instruments have&#13;
shown interest in establishing agencies with service backup for marketing their products in India, and&#13;
other Indian electronic device manufacturers are beginning to develop digital water level recorders.&#13;
Digital instruments are considered preferable to the autographic recorder and will be provided under&#13;
the project.&#13;
16. Selection of Sites for Observation Wells with Water Level Recorders. There will be need for&#13;
coordination between the CGWB regional offices and the corresponding SGO of any state territory in&#13;
planning for network improvements to obtain optimum coverage from the combined networks and&#13;
avoid redundancies. At the more detailed level of actual site selection, the security of the facility from&#13;
vandalism will be a prime consideration. Provision of guards may not be an affordable solution,&#13;
except in the case of observation wells clusters (installed to monitor interactions between aquifers at&#13;
various depths), where several observation wells and their instrumentation would be located within a&#13;
very small area. Thus, reasonably secure locations, such as a manned climatic station, a police post&#13;
compound or within the compound of a senior village official, would have to be sought. A&#13;
compromise may have to be reached in site selection to achieve the essential level of security. The&#13;
participating states and their corresponding CGWB regional offices are deciding, locating and&#13;
mapping their combined observation tubewell networks as a pre-project activity.&#13;
17.   Servicing of Digital Water Level Recorders. The digital water level recorders are powered by&#13;
heavy duty, long life, rechargeable 1 2V batteries. Though manufacturers may claim that instruments&#13;
can run for 12 months or more without servicing, this is not a good practice except in exceptional&#13;
circumstances. Other parts of the electronic instrument may fail, apart from the battery, and a long,&#13;
important and irretrievable record will be lost if the servicing interval is made too long. On the other&#13;
hand, costs for servicing become very high if the servicing interval is made too short. A good&#13;
compromise would be to service the instruments at one to two months interval. Experience will show&#13;
which is the safest and most appropriate interval in Indian conditions. Servicing staff must carry&#13;
spare rechargeable batteries and have recharging facilities at their offices.&#13;
18.  Interval between Digital Level Recordings. Though the instruments are capable of recording&#13;
levels at very short intervals, the characteristics of groundwater level changes in wells installed for&#13;
regional monitoring purposes make short interval records unnecessary. Four times daily&#13;
measurements should normnally suffice. This will reduce energy demand from batteries.&#13;
19.    Instrument Service Contracts. All electronic instruments are subject to breakdown requiring&#13;
skilled servicing. It is envisaged that instrument suppliers will be required to provide service&#13;
contracts as part of the procurement. This will necessitate that spare instruments are held at&#13;
appropriate localities so that government staff can make an instrument change whenever equipment&#13;
goes down. It will also necessitate that a supplier has appropriate facilities (at least in each state) to&#13;
make rapid repairs, and a workable arrangement for getting defunct instruments to the repair center.&#13;
The suppliers will also be required to provide normal instrument servicing training to government&#13;
staff as part of the procurement.&#13;
Field Measuring and Sampling Equipment for Monitoring Staff&#13;
20.   As noted in para 9, the monitoring activities will still involve manual measurements of levels&#13;
in a large number of open wells and tubewells which will not be instrumented. Moreover, the&#13;
collection of samples for water quality analysis will continue. In order that measuring devices--metal&#13;
tapes and/or biaxial electric tapes--are not misused and damaged, they should be made a personal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
28&#13;
Annex 4&#13;
Page 5&#13;
issue to all staff actually involved in the monitoring program. Such parameters as EC, pH, BOD, DO&#13;
and temperature should be measured at site each time an observation well location is visited, and the&#13;
portable instruments for these measurements should also be a personal issue to the monitoring staff.&#13;
21.   It will be necessary to recover water samples for quality analyses from observation tubewells.&#13;
The water that has been stagnating in the tubewell will not be a representative sample, and it will be&#13;
necessary to turn over the water in the well to obtain a true sample of the aquifer water. Small&#13;
portable compressors with a flexible airline or small portable generators and submersible pumps are&#13;
provided to pump tubewells in these circumstances.&#13;
22.   Some laboratories will be provided with portable laboratories of the Hach type which are&#13;
capable of carrying out colorometric analyses of a wide range of chemical parameters. However,&#13;
such equipment will be used only in special circumstances. In normal situations, all analyses&#13;
excepting those of parameters which are subject to rapid change after sampling (EC, DO, BOD,&#13;
dissolved C02, etc.) will be made in the permanent laboratory facilities provided under the project&#13;
(Annex 5).&#13;

INDIA&#13;
HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Surface Water and Groundwater Ouality Monitoring&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    General. Planning of water resource development involves ensuring the availability of&#13;
water in the required quantity and appropriate quality at the right time for the anticipated use.&#13;
Biological water quality is particularly important because of potential health problems related to&#13;
water borne diseases. Drinking water has to meet stringent water quality standards and appropriate&#13;
water quality is important for agricultural and industrial uses. In addition, the water quality needs&#13;
for preservation of environmental systems are now of increasing interest. The water quality of&#13;
some Indian rivers is now deteriorating, due mainly to uncontrolled discharges of chemical wastes&#13;
from industrial processes and of untreated or partially treated sewage. Groundwater resources are&#13;
also being subjected to this type of pollution. And artificially imposed changes of flow regimes in&#13;
surface water and groundwater systems are causing water quality deterioration in coastal regions&#13;
and elsewhere in India.&#13;
2.    Water Ouality Monitoring in India. Water quality monitoring has received somewhat&#13;
limited attention in India. However, it is now recognized that industrialization and urbanization&#13;
processes and the use of fertilizers and pesticides in agriculture contribute to the deterioration of&#13;
water resources, and that water quality monitoring must be undertaken seriously to provide a firm&#13;
basis for development planning and the imposition of remedial measures.&#13;
3 .    The government agencies involved in the project which have an interest in water quality are:&#13;
(a) Central Water Commission (CWC); (b) Central Ground Water Board (CGWB); and (c) State&#13;
Irrigation or Water Resources Departments and State Groundwater Organizations. The CWC and&#13;
CGWB started basic water quality monitoring some 20 years ago. The CGWB maintains&#13;
laboratories at each of its 12 regional offices, and CWC maintains chemical laboratories at both&#13;
divisional and regional levels. Most state surface water agencies have only limited laboratory&#13;
facilities but State groundwater organizations generally operate several laboratories. Furthermore,&#13;
State Pollution Control Boards (SPCB), the Health Departments and other government agencies&#13;
carry out special water quality monitoring programs, always closely related to their specific&#13;
mandates, such as drinking water supply or the control of industrial effluent. No organization&#13;
carries out a comprehensive monitoring program on a river basin basis. And there is little&#13;
coordination between the programs of the agencies at national and state levels.&#13;
4.    The mandates of the central and state agencies participating in NP with respect to surface&#13;
water and groundwater quality are not well defined, particularly with respect to surface water. The&#13;
agencies are interested in water quality mainly with regard to irrigation water supply rather than&#13;
overall water resources assessment and development planning. Monitoring of surface water&#13;
quantity and quality rarely has a long-term perspective. Furthermore, these agencies generally have&#13;
no clear concept of what their precise role in surface water quality monitoring should be in the&#13;
future, nor do they possess the information and skills to meet the environmental challenges that are&#13;
known to exist. The Central Pollution Control Board has a mandate for improvement of water&#13;
quality in streams and wells throughout India but only limited means for its implementation. State&#13;
Pollution Control Boards generally function as licensing agencies for industries, undertaking water&#13;
quality monitoring only in streams near major urban areas and industrial belts.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 5&#13;

5.    The planning of future water resources development, the implementation of new water&#13;
infrastructure and the preservation of the water resources of the state rests with state agencies, and&#13;
mainly with the state irrigation or water resources departments and state groundwater&#13;
organizations. To exercise these responsibilities, these agencies must be able to monitor actual&#13;
conditions and trends in the quality of their increasingly scarce water resources. Therefore water&#13;
pollution monitoring will be given greater attention under NP than has hitherto been the case, with&#13;
a focus on data collection for water resources assessment for water resource development&#13;
planning.&#13;
Water Ouality Monitoring Requirements&#13;
6.    Intemational Developments in Water Oualitv Monitoring. Water quality monitoring started&#13;
in the developed countries some 50 years ago with emphasis on general chemical parameters and&#13;
dissolved oxygen in surface water. Water pollution with heavy metals (lead, cadmium, arsenic)&#13;
and other toxic trace elements became a major issue in the late 1960's. This was rapidly followed&#13;
by increased interest in organic micro-pollutants. Pollution due to use of pesticides and herbicides&#13;
in agriculture also became a matter for concern. During the 1970's, it became evident that&#13;
monitoring should not focus only on water, but also on contamination of suspended and bottom&#13;
sediments, and on accumulation of pollutants in bio-accumulation. In the late 1970's, groundwater&#13;
pollution was recognized as a major problem, resulting from agricultural chemical inputs or&#13;
disposal of industrial waste. These developments caused an increase in the number of parameters&#13;
to be analyzed in each sample. The current trend is to optimize the observation networks to reduce&#13;
the number of locations and to increase the number of chemical parameters determined for each&#13;
location.&#13;
7.   Water Ouality Testing Needs in India. The chemical parameters commonly determined in&#13;
surface water and groundwater are the ions of calcium, magnesium, sodium, potassium, iron,&#13;
manganese carbonates, chloride, sulfate and nitrate, together with total dissolved solids, electrical&#13;
conductivity (EC) and pH. Pollution with toxic metals and organic micro-pollutants has received&#13;
little attention. Facilities for the chemical analysis of heavy metals and organic micro-pollutants are&#13;
not available with the project agencies in peninsular India, though some facilities are available at the&#13;
central laboratory of CGWB at Lucknow. It is intended that routine monitoring be initiated for&#13;
selected heavy metals and organic micro-pollutants in surface water and groundwater under NP.&#13;
Attention will also be given to the contamination of suspended solids and bottom sediments, and to&#13;
the accumulation of pollutants in bio-accumulation.&#13;
8.    Monitoring Objectives. The common monitoring objectives relate to trend detection,&#13;
assessment of total loads of contaminants, and testing on compliance of water quality to ceiling&#13;
levels set for specific functions of water systems. Trend detection is important for establishing&#13;
policies for pollution control, and to monitor the success of the implementation of such policies.&#13;
The assessment of total annual loads of contaminants in surface waters is of particular importance&#13;
for areas where a substantial deposition of contaminated sediments can occur, such as reservoirs,&#13;
lakes, delta areas and estuaries. Information on loads is often used Dfor the identification of&#13;
pollution occurrences and for detection of sources of pollution. Ceiling levels specify water quality&#13;
requirements for specific functions of water systems, such as the suitability of water for irrigation,&#13;
household use, industrial uses and recreation or to set maximum allowed pollution levels for preser-&#13;
vation of the environment. Regular monitoring is required to assess the suitability of water in&#13;
quality terms for various functional uses, and to initiate specific pollution control measures as&#13;
required. And regular monitoring of surface water is also essential for water bodies at risk from&#13;
toxic spills, together with clearly defined remedial actions and procedures.&#13;
9.    Information on water quality is required for a range of purposes, including:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
31&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 3&#13;
(a)  water resources assessment and resources development planning;&#13;
(b)  comprehensive assessment of the status of the aquatic environment vis-a-vis prevailing&#13;
water quality standards and national and international agreements;&#13;
(c)  identification and monitoring of sources and loads of pollutants, and the identification of&#13;
areas in need of improvement;&#13;
(d)  monitoring of the impacts of regulations and remedial measures for the control of water&#13;
pollution;&#13;
(e)  assessment of past, present and future effects of significant natural and anthropogenic&#13;
activities on the aquatic environment,resulting from activities such as dams, diversions,&#13;
irrigation, and industrial, agricultural and urban developments;&#13;
(f)  planning, design and operation of domestic, industrial and irrigation water supply&#13;
schemes;&#13;
(g) maintenance of the requisite quality of water in rivers and lakes for bathing for hygienic,&#13;
religious and recreational purposes;&#13;
(h) investigation and control of the discharge of domestic, agricultural and industrial effluents&#13;
into rivers and aquifers;&#13;
(i)  investigation and control of saline water intrusion in coastal areas, and of salinity&#13;
problems in irrigated areas; and&#13;
(j) identification of toxic spills and application of remedial measures.&#13;
10.   Roles of Central and State Organizations. Responsibilities for water quality monitoring are&#13;
shared by several central and state organizations. To enable central authorities to formulate&#13;
nationwide water quality policies and to advise and direct state agencies in these matters, it is&#13;
necessary that CWC and CGWB maintain monitoring networks which provide an overview of the&#13;
quality of the nation's waters. Optimization of central agency monitoring networks should focus on&#13;
minimization of the number of stations, increasing sampling frequencies, and increasing the number&#13;
of parameters to be analyzed, including heavy metals and organic micro-pollutants. Trend detection&#13;
is their most important objective. The assessment of total annual loads of specific contaminants in&#13;
surface waters should become a specific monitoring objective for CWC. The preservation of&#13;
adequate water quality standards is the responsibility of the States. Both trend detection and testing&#13;
on compliance of water quality to ceiling levels for specific purposes must, therefore, be part of the&#13;
mandate of the state agencies participating in NP. Central and state monitoring networks should be&#13;
optimized to avoid duplication. Due account should be taken of monitoring activities of other state&#13;
agencies, such as SPCBs.&#13;
11.   Optimization of Monitoring Networks. The selection of parameters to be monitored,&#13;
monitoring locations and monitoring frequencies are determined by the monitoring objectives.&#13;
Trends in certain parameters may occur over large areas, requiring the selection of representative&#13;
locations for trend detection which can provide information for explaining the observed trend.&#13;
Correlation analysis is often used to detect redundant locations. Monitoring frequencies are deter-&#13;
mined by relevant margins (para 13) and the observed variability in time in the measured&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
32&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 4&#13;
concentrations. A practical problem is that inter-station correlation's and time variability can only be&#13;
determined once an abundance of water quality information, both in time and in space, has been&#13;
collected. Testing of samples for ceiling levels is linked to 'project locations', such as irrigation&#13;
offtakes, drinking water supply sources and recreational areas. Measurement frequencies are&#13;
determined by the variability in the parameters to be monitored and the actual use of the waters&#13;
throughout the year. Thus, the optimization of monitoring networks and frequencies requires in-&#13;
depth studies which will be undertaken during project implementation.&#13;
12.   Parameters to be Monitored. Part A of Table I presents a list of basic parameters for water&#13;
quality monitoring under NP. These parameters are already determined in many of the central and&#13;
state agency laboratories in the project area. Facilities equipped for analysis of these parameters&#13;
have been designated as Level II laboratories, and would serve most of the needs of water supply&#13;
for agriculture and drinking water use. However, testing of only the parameters listed in Table I&#13;
would not satisfy international standards for drinking water use. Therefore, the laboratories of&#13;
central agencies and those of the states in the state capitals would be given the facilities to analyze&#13;
for heavy metals and organic micro-pollutants as listed in Part B of Table 1. Such laboratories are&#13;
designated Level II+ laboratories. The CGWB central laboratory in Lucknow and the CWC&#13;
laboratory for the South Central Region in Hyderabad will be equipped with more advanced&#13;
analytical capabilities to provide the designated Level III facility.&#13;
13.  The listed parameters are indicative and need to be refined and adapted on the basis of: (a)&#13;
agreed monitoring objectives, (b) concentrations actually occurring in the waters in a state or region,&#13;
(c) toxic characteristics, (d) current developments in production and use of particular substances,&#13;
and (e) the relevant regulations and laws. In other words, monitoring should be demand driven.&#13;
14.   Relevant Margin. For each parameter, a relevant margin needs to be defined, which is a&#13;
measure of the information which is of relevance to the users of the data. The relevant margin has&#13;
no relation to measurement accuracy or to detection limits. For example, in the event a constituent&#13;
becomes toxic at a level of 100 mg/I, there may be no need to determine concentrations with an&#13;
accuracy better than 10 mg/I, even if the detection limit could be 0.01 mg/I. Consequently, relevant&#13;
margin is a measure of the required accuracy and determines the suitability of specific analysis&#13;
methods and equipments. It also is a determining factor in the optimization of monitoring&#13;
networks, including the choice of the monitoring frequency.&#13;
Laboratories and Equipment&#13;
15.   Types of Laboratories. Laboratory facilities are graded as Level I, II, II+ and III for project&#13;
purposes. Level I laboratories are located at surface water flow gauging sites and equipped to&#13;
measure in-situ certain parameters which need to be determined within 24 hours, such as pH, EC,&#13;
DO, BOD and TDS. It is assumed that two or three adjacent gauging sites can be covered from one&#13;
level I laboratory. Level II laboratories are equipped to perform chemical analyses for the basic&#13;
parameters listed in Table IA. A Level II+ laboratory is a Level II enhanced with an atomic&#13;
absorption spectrophotometer and a gas chromatograph for the analysis of heavy metals and organic&#13;
micro-pollutants. A Level III laboratory would have the major addition of an inductive coupled&#13;
plasma spectrophotometer, to allow more accurate and extensive studies to be undertaken with&#13;
respect to heavy metal pollution. Equipment for each type of laboratory are detailed in Sections&#13;
2.55 and 2.56 of Annex 2, Table 2.&#13;
16.   Distribution of Laboratories. Based on a review of the current status and potential for&#13;
improvement of water quality monitoring activities, chemical laboratories will be established or&#13;
upgraded as detailed in Table 2 of this Annex.&#13;

17.  Buildings for Laboratories. Provisions are made in the cost estimates for construction of&#13;
new buildings or improvement to existing buildings for laboratory use as required. The detailed&#13;
descriptions of the buildings to be provided for CWC, CGWB and the participating states are&#13;
given in their respective Annexes.&#13;
Water Ouality Data Processing and Management&#13;
18.  Current Situation. CWC and state level surface water agencies make virtually no use of&#13;
computers to store and process surface water quality data. CGWB headquarters and regional&#13;
offices use computers to store groundwater quality data but the software is outdated, rigid and&#13;
inadequate. Some state groundwater organizations use simple programs for water quality data&#13;
storage and processing.&#13;
19.  Data Processing and Management Requirements. For planning and management purposes,&#13;
water quality information should be easily accessible at state and national levels. Computerized&#13;
data management systems for storing and processing of water quality information will be set-up in&#13;
the central and state data centers to be established under NP (Annex 7). These systems would be&#13;
used for analyzing and reviewing water quality data in the local or regional water use and&#13;
environmental contexts. The water quality data systems would store the results of analyses&#13;
produced in participating laboratories and would also contain related information, such as datum-&#13;
references, station-type, sampling position, sampling methods, quantity of samples and remarks.&#13;
Data which can be obtained from other monitoring agencies such SPCBs would also be collected&#13;
and stored in the data systems. The central and state water quality data management systems will&#13;
be fully compatible and therefore complimentary.&#13;
20.   Computers for Laboratory Use. Water quality data will be created and validated in the&#13;
laboratories. Each Level 11, Level II+ and Level III laboratory will be provided with an&#13;
appropriate package of computer hardware, software and ancillaries to carry out its tasks. Data&#13;
will be entered into computer storage according to the prescribed formats at the laboratories and&#13;
transferred to the respective data center by floppy disc.&#13;
21.  Dissemination of Data. The basic water quality data stored in the central, regional and state&#13;
level water data banks would, in common with all water data, be easily accessible and readily&#13;
available to all legitimate users in an appropriate format. In addition, consolidated overviews of&#13;
the current state of water quality in a state or region would be published regularly (preferably&#13;
annually) and relevant results of research would be disseminated widely.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening&#13;
22.  As explained in para 2 above, water quality monitoring has received somewhat linited atten-&#13;
tion in India. Consequently, there is need for substantially institutional strengthening to reflect the&#13;
upgrading of existing facilities and new facilities to be provided under the project. Thus the project&#13;
provides for: additional qualified staff to implement and operate the improved laboratories,&#13;
training of existing and new staff, and provision of office and equipment, described below.&#13;
23.  Training of Laboratory Staff. Specific training requirements have been identified for staff of&#13;
chemical laboratories (Annex I1). From each Level II+ and Level III laboratory, at least two&#13;
chemists will be trained in (i) the use of advanced equipment such as the atomic absorption&#13;
spectrophotometer and gas chromatograph, (ii) chemistry of toxic micro-pollutants, (iii) water&#13;
quality related micro-biology, (iv) computer data processing with the water quality system&#13;
software, (v) the interpretation of water quality data with particular emphasis on toxic anorganic&#13;
and organic micro-pollutants, and (vi) the development of comprehensive overviews of the status&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
34&#13;
Annex 5&#13;
Page 6&#13;
of water quality in the concerned basin, region or state. In addition, more junior staff from Levels&#13;
II, II+ and III laboratories will be given training focused primarily on basic chemistry, the use of&#13;
equipment, the use of computers for data storage and validation, and basic data interpretation.&#13;
24.  Specialist Cadre on Environmental Aspects of Water Oualitv. The development of an&#13;
effective capability in environmental analysis, comprehensive assessment of water quality&#13;
conditions and pollution control will require the recruitment of specialists in aquatic ecology in&#13;
addition to chemists. Such specialist cadres would need exposure to recent developments abroad&#13;
in water pollution studies and modelling, and water quality management.&#13;
25.  Vehicles for Laboratory Use. One jeep is provided for use of each Level II, Level II+ or&#13;
Level III laboratory.&#13;
Other Items&#13;
26.  Research and Development. As part of the R&amp;D activities to be undertaken by the project&#13;
(Annex 8), pilot water pollution studies will be defined and implemented with the assistance of&#13;
specialist provided under the consultancy component of the project.&#13;
27.  Quality Control. Quality control is an essential and integral element of a monitoring&#13;
program to ensure the credibility of the information developed. Quality control requires&#13;
standardized field procedures. The quality of data generated in a laboratory depends in the first&#13;
instance on the integrity of the samples provided. Quality control should also cover the laboratory&#13;
analyses. Replicate samples must be collected and analyzed to check the accuracy of the sampling&#13;
and analysis techniques. And the integrity of the data storage and processing procedures must be&#13;
ensured.&#13;
28.  Standardization Program. Standardization of water quality monitoring is an important issue.&#13;
Both CWC and CGWB in close cooperation with their regional offices and the states would&#13;
develop standards and guidelines for design of monitoring networks, specification of monitoring&#13;
frequencies, selection of parameters to be monitored, sampling and analysis procedures,&#13;
specifications for equipment, and quality control procedures. Through frequent sampling of&#13;
selected surface water and groundwater observation sites in each region, information can be&#13;
developed on the variability in time of various water quality parameters. And decisions can be&#13;
taken on selection of parameters and periodicity of sampling for routine monitoring for each&#13;
region. The findings would be defined in Surface Water and Groundwater Quality Monitoring&#13;
Manuals. These would also provide evaluation guidelines for water quality information, and&#13;
guidance for the presentation of water quality year books.&#13;
29.  Replacement and Maintenance of Equipment. Maintenance of advanced equipment (in&#13;
particular non-indigenous) has been generally inadequate due to lack of adequate budget provisions&#13;
and difficulties for the importation of spare parts. The project makes a budget provision equivalent&#13;
to 25% of the procurement cost of laboratory equipment for replacements and repairs during the&#13;
project life, and consumables are also accounted for. However, in the longer term, it will be&#13;
necessary to ensure annual budgets for maintenance of equipment and laboratory consumables.&#13;
Without adequate procurement arrangements and guaranteed budgets for O&amp;M, the sustainability&#13;
of investments in laboratory facilities will be in jeopardy.&#13;

HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Meteoroloeical Activities&#13;
BackLround&#13;
1.    Systematic observation of the spatial and temporal variations of meteorological&#13;
parameters, particularly of rainfall, has a long history in India because these climatic variables&#13;
impact so broadly on the economy. The India Meteorological Department (IMD) is a central&#13;
government agency and is organised exclusively to provide the fullest range of meteorological&#13;
services to the nation. It was established in 1875 and is therefore one of the oldest scientific&#13;
departments in the country. The administrative or revenue departments were the first agencies at&#13;
state level to establish rainfall networks and still retain responsibility under law for publication&#13;
of state rainfall data. The distribution of their networks was in accord with the pattern of&#13;
administrative headquarters down to district level. Agricultural departments had an obvious&#13;
interest in historical and current weather information, and established networks of rainfall and&#13;
climatic stations positioned to suit their specific purposes. And the state irrigation agencies&#13;
required rainfall and climatic data for developing rainfall-runoff relationships in river basins and&#13;
for design and operation of irrigation systems, and have commonly supplemented other sources&#13;
of information with their own networks of rainfall and climatic stations. The CWC has also&#13;
established a network of rainfall and climatic stations, normally located at manned stream&#13;
gauging sites.&#13;
2.    The project will upgrade or repair the existing facilities at rainfall and climatic stations&#13;
and expand the networks of the surface water irrigation agencies in the participating states and&#13;
upgrade the existing CWC networks. The IMD will have an important and active function to&#13;
provide advice and guidance to the operating agencies for selection and siting of the equipment&#13;
installed at the improved and new observation stations and for operating the networks. This&#13;
Annex describes the improvements to the meteorological data collection and management&#13;
systems envisaged under the project. Agency specific information on system improvements for&#13;
CWC, [MD and for the various state agencies are in the respective annexes.&#13;
Present Status of Climatic Data Collection&#13;
3.    Table 1 of this Annex shows the existing meteorological observation networks in the&#13;
participating states, classified according to operating agency and station type. The table shows&#13;
that rainfall is observed by one or other agency at a total of about 7,200 stations, while other&#13;
climatic parameters - typically atmosphere pressure, temperature, humidity, wind direction and&#13;
speed, evaporation and cloud cover or sunshine hours - are additionally measured at around 640&#13;
climatic stations. Most commonly, rainfall stations are equipped with standard daily rain gauges&#13;
(SRG), but some 1,955 stations have additionally an autographic rain gauge (ARG) with&#13;
capabilities to measure rainfall duration and intensity within the day. The climatic stations are&#13;
most commonly manned stations equipped for Penman evaporation calculations. Gujarats&#13;
Narmada and Water Resources Department has operated five automatic weather stations (AWS)&#13;
for the past few years, and Orissa's DOI has recently installed three AWSs. Field inspection of&#13;
a number of CWC and state irrigation agency meteorological observation sites has revealed that&#13;
improperly located instruments, ill maintained or defunct instruments, and substandard&#13;
observation procedures are common features. These are reproted to detract from the value of&#13;
the data recorded.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
38&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 2&#13;
4.    There are more than 9,000 rain gauging stations in India, most of which are maintained&#13;
by state departments. However, data from only about 4,500 stations are received and processed&#13;
by IMD at its National Date Centre in Pune, from where computer printouts of daily and&#13;
monthly rainfall data for periods typically varying from 50 to 100 years (and on other climatic&#13;
parameters for shorter sequences) can be obtained on a payment basis. The large number of&#13;
stations omitted from the IMD record in part reflects their failure to meet the required standards&#13;
for siting and selection of equipment, and for data collection procedures. The IMD has adopted&#13;
criteria and procedures specified by the World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) for the&#13;
establishment and operation of rainfall and climatic stations which must be met by all stations&#13;
producing data for inclusion in the IMD record.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
5.    The main project objectives relating to meteorological data would be to improve the&#13;
organizational arrangements, technical capabilities and physical facilities for the measurement of&#13;
climatic determinants, quality control to ensure reliable data, development of mechanisms for&#13;
effective data management and development of systems for dissemination of hydro-&#13;
meteorological information by the concerned agencies at both central and state levels. The nature&#13;
and scope of these objectives would demand significant technical assistance and training to&#13;
support the improvement of technical capabilities, and development of data banks and data&#13;
transfer systems.&#13;
Project Strategy&#13;
6.  The CWC and the state surface water agencies intend to upgrade and augment their&#13;
hydrometeorological networks and to bring about uniformity in equipment and procedures for&#13;
data collection, processing and management. To achieve this, CWC and the participating&#13;
surface water agencies will have to closely collaborate with IMD in the following activities: (a)&#13;
planning and design of raingauge and climatic networks; (b) procurement and installation of&#13;
instruments; (c) technical training in meteorological observations and data processing to project&#13;
field staff; (d) routine maintenance, monitoring, evaluation and quality control of meteorological&#13;
observation sites; and (e) data compilation and resource analysis and studies. With respect to&#13;
item (e) above, analysis and studies would include river basin water balances, computation of&#13;
design storms, quantitative precipitation forecasting, and development of watershed models.&#13;
Details of Components&#13;
7.  Table 1 of this Annex shows the existing meteorological networks in the participating&#13;
states, and the forseen improvements to the networks of the surface water hydrology agencies&#13;
in those states. Table 2 details the work programs and estimated costs for the meteorological&#13;
components for each of the particpating agnieces. Until detailed site investigations and surveys&#13;
are undertaken under the project, the upgrading and improvements to the exisitng networks and&#13;
instruments have been estimated from sample surveys. Lump sum allocations are therefore&#13;
made in the cost estimates for replacement or repair of instruments installed on the existing&#13;
meteorological networks.&#13;
8.  Network Improvemen . All the surface water agencies of the participating states plan to&#13;
improve and expand their hydrological networks; the CWC will upgrade its existing networks&#13;
and make some expansion of its networks. As escribed in para 1 above, the existing state&#13;
networks resulted from the essentially uncoordinated activities of several agencies. Stations&#13;
were located first for easy operation and management, and later to meet the perceived&#13;
requirements of individual departments. The emerging pattem of rainfall and climatic stations&#13;
did not result from any serious attempt at obtaining an optimum cover of observation sites.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
39&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 3&#13;
Moreover, specific site locations were often poorly selected to obtain truly representative&#13;
measurements of the meteorological parameters observed, which were intended to reflect&#13;
conditions in the area controlled by the station. Detailed site designs and instruments selected&#13;
were not to appropriate standards, and sites and instruments are often poorly maintained.&#13;
9.  Site Investigations and Surveys. The first requirement will be a detailed inventory of the&#13;
existing CWC and state surface water agency networks in each state which would record: (a)&#13;
station type and location; (b) any site defects and actions for improvements; (c) specifications of&#13;
existing instrumentation, whether of standard pattern and needs for repair or replacement; and&#13;
(d) effectiveness of measurements made and record keeping, and any needs for improvement.&#13;
Following completion of the inventory, a review will be carried out of the entire state&#13;
meteorological networks (including those of other agencies and particularly stations approved to&#13;
provide data to IMD) to determine the network improvements required to obtain an optimum&#13;
coverage providing reliable data. This could involve expanding the number of rainfall or&#13;
climatic stations in some areas, relocation of some poorly sited stations, or deletion of stations&#13;
which are recognised as redundant for any reason. The inventory and the review will result in a&#13;
map showing the distribution and types of stations in the improved networks and detailed list of&#13;
the equipment and works required to implement the improvements.&#13;
10.   The above activities will be carried out by the concerned agencies with the assistance of&#13;
experienced officers from IMD. The decisions on optimization of network layouts, the&#13;
appropriateness of existing observation sites or the selection of new sites, and site designs and&#13;
instrumentation will be made by IMD.&#13;
II.   Procurement and Installation of Instruments. The IMD manufactures all the surface and&#13;
upper air instruments it uses at its workshops located at Pune and New Delhi. The department&#13;
also meets some instrument supply demand of central and state agencies on a direct payment&#13;
basis. The specifications of all instruments have been standardized in collaboration with the&#13;
Indian Standards Institute (SI) which has enabled a number of private manufactures to market&#13;
their products (see Annex 13b). And IMD will provide calibration certification for such&#13;
instruments for a fee. Thus, all meteorological instruments of Indian origin procured for project&#13;
use can be of authorized standards. This will be a project criteria. Moreover, if meteorological&#13;
instruments are to be imported for project use, their specifications and suitability will be subject&#13;
to IMD review. Installation of all meteorological instruments at rainfall or climatic stations are&#13;
subject to a standard layouts with IMD specifications for the civil works. Therefore all&#13;
meteorological instrument installation work will be implemented under the technical guidance of&#13;
IMD inspectors.&#13;
12.   Instument Calibration and Certification. The IMD sets standards for all meteorological&#13;
activities in India and, in general, carries out its scientific work according to procedures&#13;
recommended by WMO. The department manufactures all commonly used meteorological&#13;
equipments for its own use and can be a supplier to other government agencies. Moreover,&#13;
IMD, together with the Bureau of Indian Standards, has set specifications for all instruments,&#13;
under which local manufacturers can market their products, and IMD will individually calibrate&#13;
and certificate the instruments produced by manufacturers for a fee. The project will upgrade&#13;
and modernize the exisiting facilites at Pune that calibrate and certify surface meteorologial&#13;
equipment.&#13;
13.   Operation of Observatories and Data Processing. All meteorological observations&#13;
would be recorded at prescribed hours according to internationally recognized standards. For&#13;
climatic stations, observations are taken twice a day at 0830 and 1730. The autographic charts&#13;
are changed daily at 0830. The following procedures would be followed in recording the&#13;
observations. Eye reading instruments are seen first and then charts of autographic instruments&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
40&#13;
Annex 6&#13;
Page 4&#13;
are replaced. All readings are entered at site in a 'pocket register' and then transferred to&#13;
permanent registers or prescribed forms. The values from the autographic charts are also&#13;
tabulated. The data from field stations will be sent to the controlling office (Sub-division) and,&#13;
after a quality control check, on to the Division where data will be again scrutinized before&#13;
being processed for computer input. The computerized data will then be forwarded up to the&#13;
controlling data center. The IMD will train the CWC and state agencies in the processing and&#13;
storage of data to IMD format and standards.&#13;
14.   Date Compilation. A project objective is to introduce standardized procedures for data&#13;
compilation of all meteorological parameters to be collected at project meteorological stations.&#13;
IMD has prescribed forms for data compilation of the standard parameters. These are to be&#13;
completed on a daily, weekly, monthly, seasonal and annual basis depending upon the&#13;
operational requirement. The formats will be made available to CWC and state agencies for&#13;
processing the data for storage purposes and for supply to users.&#13;
15.   Quality Control. The basic requirement with respect to quality control is the periodic on-&#13;
site inspections of observatories to ensure that the instruments are in good working condition,.&#13;
The exposure conditions should already be to IMD standards when the existing sites are&#13;
upgraded or remodelled and when new sites are selected. However, the exposure conditions&#13;
also need to be checked to ensure the foliage growth has not impaired the site. The inspection&#13;
should ensure that observers are fully conversant with routine quality control work. Entries in&#13;
the registers/forms would be checked by the supervisory staff to ensure that they are properly&#13;
made. In addition, field stations would be checked to ensure that they have sufficient stocks of&#13;
autographic charts, spares, recording stationery, etc. to be operated effectively. Initially, this&#13;
inspection work would be entrusted to IMD and a procedure would be put in place so that the&#13;
controlling office takes prompt action on the Inspection Report if any rectification/repair work is&#13;
needed. Eventually, trained state staff should be able to take over the quality control work with&#13;
the IMD staff making more infrequent visits.&#13;
16.   Daa Management Improvements. The meteorological data collected by CWC and the&#13;
state agencies will be subject to similar management improvement to those intended for&#13;
hydrological data. Verified basic data will be entered into computer storage at the Subdivisional&#13;
or Divisional Office in charge of any meteorological observation station, and from there it will&#13;
be transferred by NICNET or by floppy disk to the concerned data centre (Annex 7). Once&#13;
entered into the data centre's meteorological data bank, it will become available to all legitimate&#13;
user agencies, and for exchange or transfer as required between central and state data centres.&#13;
The data will also be transferred by floppy disk to the state meteorological center of IMD and,&#13;
after electronic verification at IMD's data center, a copy will be returned to the state&#13;
meteorological center to be retained in a data base which can be accessed by legitimate users.&#13;
The improvements effected by the project on the existing meteorological network (para 7 et seq)&#13;
are intended to improve stations to IMD standards. This should mean that additional stations&#13;
could be included in the approved list that supplies data to IMD's National Data Centre at Pune&#13;
where an advanced computerized system for data management is already in place.&#13;
17.   Training. The IMD is the only organization in India with the resources to undertake a&#13;
comprehensive range of in-service training in meteorology. Besides training its own employees,&#13;
it undertakes training of personnel from the Indian Air Force, the Anny and the Navy. The main&#13;
training center is located in Pune and is recognized as the Regional Training Center for&#13;
Southeast Asian countries by WMO. This internationally recognized training capability would&#13;
be used to train project staff (Annex 10).&#13;

INDIA&#13;
HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Data Management and Communication Systems&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The High Level Technical Committee on Hydrology (HILTECH) was formed by the&#13;
Government of India (GOI) in 1985 to review the performance of hydrological activities (in the&#13;
broadest sense) by central and state agencies, to identify deficiencies, and to make recommendation&#13;
for improvements to recording, processing and management of hydrological data. The report of&#13;
HILTECH was published in 1987. Among the observations of deficiencies in hydrological&#13;
practices made by the Committee was the lack of systematic processes for archiving and retrieval of&#13;
hydrologic data collected by the concerned central and state agencies. This in turn linked to the&#13;
absence of uniform database management systems for use by the agencies to enhance the efficacy&#13;
with which data could be exchanged and used. The need for interactive data management systems&#13;
is highlighted in India's 'National Water Policy' (MOWR, 1987) which states 'the prime requisite&#13;
for resource planning is a well developed information systemn' and 'there should be free exchange&#13;
of data among the various agencies.'&#13;
2.    One important follow-up to the HILTECH report was India's request to the Bank for&#13;
support for implementation of the Hydrology Project (originally called the National Hydrology&#13;
Project). During preparation of the project, the importance of using modem, computerized systems&#13;
for the establishment of interactive data banks for hydrological information in the data collecting&#13;
agencies was clearly recognised, together with the need to develop appropriate communication&#13;
systems to enable free and efficient exchange of data between the collecting agencies and easy&#13;
access to the data bases by all legitimate user agencies. This annex describes the data management&#13;
systems that will be provided to the central and state data collecting agencies under Part A, while&#13;
Part B discusses the communication systems by which data will be first assembled in the data&#13;
banks of the collecting agencies, and then exchanged between data banks, and made available to&#13;
user agencies. Specific details of the computer hardware and software and other equipment that&#13;
will be provided to the collecting agencies are discussed in Annexes for the agencies at the national&#13;
level and the participating states.&#13;
A. Data Management Systems&#13;
General&#13;
3.    The project plans to develop interactive computerized data banks within CWC, CGWB and&#13;
the state agencies responsible for surface water and groundwater hydrological data collection.&#13;
Thus, each agency will maintain and have responsibility for a data banking system for the data it&#13;
collects. This places responsibility for verifying data and maintaining the integrity of the&#13;
information with the collecting agency. However, all of the participating agencies will use the same&#13;
computer software programs for data storage to ensure interactivity and compatibility of data bases,&#13;
and the communication systems provided (Part B of this Annex) will assure the necessary levels of&#13;
access between data bases. An important protection is that the data bases will be protected to allow&#13;
'read only' access to any user of the data.&#13;
Data Systems Software&#13;
4.    The project will not be involved in the development of software for data management&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
46&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 2&#13;
system. A number of powerful, data management systems of proven efficacy are commercially&#13;
available. Thus, software with characteristics and capabilities most appropriate to India's medium&#13;
term needs will be selected. The software will have an open architecture using intemationally&#13;
available commercial packages without proprietary interfaces. This will allow flexibility in future&#13;
changes and upgrades without being locked into a single supplier. Any special modifications of the&#13;
software to meet special requirements in India will be defined, but the applications suppliers will&#13;
have responsibility for programming the database software configurations according to negotiated&#13;
agreements.&#13;
5.    Separate data management systems will handle data on the physical parameters of surface&#13;
water, groundwater, hydrometeorology, and for water quality data, the last being modified to serve&#13;
the special needs of surface water and groundwater information respectively. However, the need&#13;
for using the data storage systems conjunctively must be recognised, and such aspects as the&#13;
geographic coding systems for data locations in the program must be fully compatible.&#13;
Groundwater data management is implicitly complex. involving a very wide range of parameters&#13;
which often must be located three dimensionally. Thus, the groundwater data management system&#13;
selected should be able to manipulate the numerous parameters stored in a seamless manner for&#13;
complex hydrogeological analyses such as system modelling. Several surface water and&#13;
groundwater data management programs exist that use international database systems. The&#13;
programs that use custom databases will not be acceptable because each change involves a major&#13;
development that can be done only by the supplier.&#13;
6.    Applications Software for Hydrological Analysis. The main objective of the creation of&#13;
water resource data banks with the data collecting agencies is to make basic data readily available to&#13;
user agencies in an easily applicable format. In many cases, the information required by the user&#13;
agencies will be the validified rainfall and flow data originally entered into storage in the data&#13;
banks. However, there will also be a demand for the results of analyzed data - for example,&#13;
hydrogeological information is commonly disseminated in the form of reports prepared by the data&#13;
collection agencies which contain the results of data analyses of various complexities. Therefore,&#13;
the data management system software provided to the agencies will be backed-up by appropriate&#13;
packages for data analysis.&#13;
Location of Data Banks&#13;
7. As noted (para 3), data banking systems will be established at centers within the CWC, CGWB&#13;
and the state surface water and groundwater organizations. It is intended that the systems will be&#13;
interactive hierarchically and laterally to the degree that is necessary for effective exchange of data.&#13;
The organization within CGWB relates directly to state areas so that matching its data centers&#13;
below its headquarters with those of the groundwater organizations within the states would present&#13;
no problems. In contrast, the organization for data collection and management in CWC is based on&#13;
basin areas, with jurisdictions from Regions through Circles to Divisions transcending state&#13;
boundaries. With this situation, it is clear that lateral transfer of surface water data between&#13;
specific state agencies and local CWC offices becomes complicated. Figures 1 and 2 show the&#13;
surface water and groundwater data flow between locations.&#13;
8.    CWC Data Centres. A national center for surface water data will be established at CWC&#13;
headquarters in New Delhi. CWC data centres with appropriate hardware and software, will also&#13;
be established at the South Central Regional Office in Hyderabad and the Southern Regional Office&#13;
in Coimbatore. The former controls CWC river gauging stations in basin areas covering the whole&#13;
or parts, of Orissa, Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat and Kamataka, while&#13;
the latter's jurisdiction is in Tamil Nadu, Kerala and part of Karnataka. As discussed below (para&#13;
15), CWC's hierarchy of four Circles and 11 Divisions under the South Central Region and one&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
47&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 3&#13;
circle and three divisions under the Southern Region will be provided with computing facilities and&#13;
data management software. Although the data management facilities and the associated&#13;
communication provisions will not be to the standard of a data center, arrangements will be made&#13;
for exchange of data as necessary between these offices and the state data centers which have&#13;
common jurisdictional area.&#13;
9.    CGWB Data Centers. With CGWB as the apex groundwater organization, a national center&#13;
for groundwater data will be established at it headquarters in Faridabad. The CGWB will have 13&#13;
regional offices after creation of the Madras office for its activities in Tamil Nadu, and seven of&#13;
these - Bhubaneswar, Hyderabad, Madras, Bangalore, Nagpur, Ahmedabad will service the&#13;
Board's activities in the seven states participating in NP, and the remaining six in Jaipur,&#13;
Chandigarh, Lucknow, Calcutta, Guwahati and Trivandrum control activities in state areas or&#13;
groups of state area out side the strict limits of the project. However, it has been decided to create&#13;
regional data centers for CGWB data in all thirteen Regional Offices.&#13;
10.   State Data Centres. Each state will establish data banks for surface water data and for&#13;
groundwater data, including the respective water quality information. The data centers will be at&#13;
the headquarters of the state agencies, and in the state capital, excepting in Maharashtra where the&#13;
banks will be in Pune. This separation of surface water and groundwater information systems will&#13;
be maintained even when the data collecting agencies are unified within a combined organization in&#13;
a single department. Essentially duplicate hardware provision, but with appropriate software, are&#13;
made for state surface water and groundwater banking systems for this purpose (para 18).&#13;
1 1.   The state data management centers will be located in: Bhubaneswar for Orissa in the&#13;
Irrigation Department (ID) for surface water and the Rural Development Department (RDD) for&#13;
groundwater: Hyderabad for Andhra Pradesh in separate agencies within the Department of&#13;
Irrigation and Command Area Development (DOICAD); Madras for Tamil Nadu in a combined&#13;
organisation in the newly created Water Resources Department (WRD); Pune for Maharashtra in&#13;
the ID for surface water and the RDD for groundwater; Ahmedabad for Gujarat in separate surface&#13;
water and groundwater agencies under the Narmada and Water Resources Department (NWRD);&#13;
and Bhopal for MP within a combined organisation in the WRD.&#13;
Data Exchange and Transfer between Data Centres&#13;
12.   The basic objective for the establishment of interactive data centers in the states and in the&#13;
regional and headquarters offices of CWC and CGWB is that common pools of data will be created&#13;
at state and central levels. However, this does not mean that the national data centers with CWC&#13;
(surface water data) and CGWB (groundwater data) must duplicate storage of the entire state&#13;
databases. Similarly, it will not,be necessary to duplicate storage of concerned state databases in&#13;
CWC and CGWB regional office data centers, and vice versa. In fact, with the levels of&#13;
communication envisaged between data centers (see Part B), interconnected centers become a joint&#13;
source of data which can be drawn from by either center by file transfer as required.&#13;
13.   It is envisaged that the CWC and CGWB regional data centers (paras 8 and 9), which each&#13;
assemble and store their agency's data from within their areas of jurisdiction, will transfer their&#13;
entire data bases to the respective national data centers on a regular basis. However, the state&#13;
surface water and groundwater data center will transfer to the CWC and CGWB national data&#13;
centers, as applicable, only data from agreed selected stations. But the state data centers will&#13;
maintain up-to-date details of the entire databases that they have in storage, and the catalogues of&#13;
data will be copied at the national centers. The national centers will be able to access any part of&#13;
the state databases that they wish to use through the communication system. A downward transfer&#13;
of data from the national centers to the state centers will also be possible, but lateral exchan-e .t&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 7&#13;

data between the CWC and CGWB regional data centers and the state data centers will be the more&#13;
normal process (para 14).&#13;
14.   The CWC regionial data ceniters (and the computer storages at some Circle and Divisional&#13;
offices) will need to be interactive ftor exchange of data with the state surface water data centers&#13;
(para 8). A similar arranygemiient will be made for exchange of groundwater data between the&#13;
concerned CGWB regionial otffice data centers (para 9) and the participating state groundwater data&#13;
centers. A decision will be made about how much of the databases is actually duplicated in each&#13;
interacting data center. The data communications system (Part B) will provide great flexibility to&#13;
transfer information between locations connected to NICNET. Either complete files or selected&#13;
data can be transfen-ed. Electr-oic mail allows a user to request the transfer of data from a database&#13;
to another location. At the database, the operator will create a new file with the requested data and&#13;
will transfer- it to the requestor. The system provides a high level of security and control of the&#13;
individual database by the agency that ownls it. As use confidence in the communication system&#13;
increases, duplication of data will become unnecessary because remote access to data is easy.&#13;
Computer-ization of Data Manageniegnt below Data Centres&#13;
15.   Initial processing and validationi of suLiface water data begins at the stream gauging stations&#13;
and continues upwar-ds through the command hierarchy to Divisional or Circle levels in both CWC&#13;
and the state surtface water oreanlizations. The state groundwater organisation use similar&#13;
command arrangements down to Subdivisions or sections with areal responsibilities for data&#13;
collectioll. In some cases, the C'GWB commanld structure terminates at the Regional Office, while&#13;
some Regional Offices have a unit office with responsibility for part of their area (see Annex 16).&#13;
Entrv of data into computer storage should be initiated at the lowest practical level in the data&#13;
collection and processing hierarchy. But constraints are placed by the availability of staff with&#13;
computing expertise aiid by office facility limitations, particularly power supply, in most lower&#13;
level units. In the CWC. comiiputing facilities will be provided down to subdivisions. In state&#13;
surtface water a-enicies and state groundwater agencies, provision of computing facilities will&#13;
generally begin at the divisionalI, levels (or equivalent). When CGWB unit offices exist in the&#13;
participating states, they will be provided with appropriate computer hardware and software. And&#13;
all laboratories of Level II anid above (Annex 5) will be provided with computer facilities.&#13;
Details of Computing Facilities and Aicillaries&#13;
16.   Standard packages of computer- hardware and software plus ancillaries have been defined&#13;
as considered appropriate to meet the requirements of the different levels of data banking and for&#13;
the offices involved in data collection and processing below the data centers. However, the strict&#13;
standardization of the packages in part reflects the need for simplification for the purpose of cost&#13;
estimating, and should not be applied so rigorously that the efficiency of a computing unit could be&#13;
effected detrimentally. It will be noted that key components - PCs and printers - are duplicated in&#13;
the smaller computing units, in part to provide backup in case of breakdowns.&#13;
17.   National Data Center Facilities. The national data centers for surface water at CWC&#13;
headquarters and for groundwater at CGWB headquarters will require computing facilities to&#13;
handle information collected from their own national networks, and at least part of the data from&#13;
the state networks (para 12). They will also be involved with considerable amounts of data&#13;
analysis. In particular. the CGWB produces technical reports and maps and requires desk top&#13;
publishing capabilities to support these activities. The national data centers will therefore be&#13;
equipped with computer package Type A detailed in Section 2.31 of Tabe 2, Annex2. The&#13;
hardware would comprise: a file server (RISC workstation); eight PCs/486dx2; two laser printers:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
49&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 5&#13;
eight dot matrix printers; a plotter (AO colour); a digitizer (AO flatbed); a scanner; three monitor&#13;
upgrades; plus nine UPSs, network cables and cards. The software will include: the surface water&#13;
or groundwater data svstem; the water quality data system; UNIX operating system; an appropriate&#13;
hydrological package; a general purpose package; and a network system. A generator will be&#13;
provided. Other office equipment include: furnishings, six air conditioners; a photocopier and a&#13;
fax machine.&#13;
18.   State Data Center Facilities. The surface water and groundwater data centers managed by&#13;
state agencies will be provided with similar computing facilities, with major items duplicated even&#13;
when the centers are controlled under a single organizational unit (para I0). Type B computing&#13;
facilities are specified for these centers, as detailed in Section 2.32 of Table 2, Annex 2. The&#13;
hardware comprises: a file server (PC486 dx2,EISA); five PCs/486 dx2; two laser printers; five&#13;
dot matrix printers; a plotter (A3 colour); a digitizer (A3); and six UPSs plus network cables and&#13;
cards. The software includes: surface water or groundwater data system; water quality data&#13;
system; an appropriate hydrological package; a general purpose package; and a network package.&#13;
A generator and two air conditioners together with office equipment including furnishings, a&#13;
photocopier and a fax machine will be provided.&#13;
19.   CWC Regional Data Center Facilities. The two CWC Regional Office data centers will be&#13;
provided with computer packages Type C, as detailed in Section 2.33 of Table 2, Annex 2. The&#13;
hardware includes: two PCs/486 dx; two laser printers; a plotter (A3); and two UPSs. The&#13;
following software will be provided: surface water data system; water quality data system; an&#13;
appropriate hydrological package; and a general purpose package. Other office inputs include&#13;
furnishings, an air conditioner, a photocopier and a fax machine. Two computers are provided foor&#13;
back-up for key data and to permit continued data entry if one machine should fail. The databaLse&#13;
will be kept updated on both computers. The data will also be backed up on 3.5" floppy disks on a&#13;
weekly basis. A program such as 'fastback' will be provided in the general purpose software to&#13;
simplify back-up.&#13;
20.   CGWB Regional Data Center Facilities. The data centers to be established in the 13&#13;
CGWB Regional Offices will have work loads on a par with state groundwater data centers. They&#13;
are therefore provided Type B facilities as described in para 18.&#13;
21.   Facilities in Offices subordinate to Data Centers. As stated in para 15, subordinate offices&#13;
below data centres to Divisional or Subdivisional levels and laboratories of Level II standard or&#13;
above will be provided with computer facilities. A standard package Type D is prescribed, as&#13;
detailed in Section 2.34 of Table 2, Annex 2. The hardware includes; two PCs/486sx; two dot&#13;
matrix printers; together with two UPSs, an air conditioner and officer furniture. The software&#13;
includes: a surface water, groundwater or water quality data system; and a general purpose&#13;
package. The pair of computers is provided for reasons given in para 19.&#13;
B. Data Communication Systems&#13;
22.   General. A basic requirement for the establishment of interactive data banking systems in&#13;
the central and state surface water and groundwater agencies is the provision of sound&#13;
communication systems for data transfer. And the communication systems should allow&#13;
unrestricted access between mutually interactive data centers to the degree that is both necessary&#13;
and practical.&#13;
23.   Communications in India are rapidly evolving due to changes in the communication laws.&#13;
Several new data communications services are in the design or early development state. The only&#13;
service currently available with extensive coverage down to district levels is the NICNET system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
50&#13;
Annex 7&#13;
Page 6&#13;
The NICNET system, based on satellite communication technology, was established by central&#13;
govemnment under the National Informatics Centre (NIC) in the last decade to enable rapid transfer&#13;
of information within the national territory, particularly for government purposes. The NIC&#13;
service is now very extensive, covering more than 600 locations with a 1.2 Kilobits satellite access&#13;
(C band system) and 1 1 locations with 2 Megabits access (Ku band system). The NICNET switch&#13;
in Delhi co-nnects the two systems through two hub earth stations. All file transfers (or messages)&#13;
go through two satellite hops - one from the originating site to Delhi and then from Delhi to the&#13;
receiving site. The system does not provide real-time transfer of information. It constitutes a store&#13;
and forward system where the transfer time is dependant on the amount of data traffic in the queue.&#13;
24.   Provision of a dedicated NICNET ground station at the data center will eliminate queuing at&#13;
the receiver end. Computers in separate data centers may be linked through NICNET by modems&#13;
and telephone. In general, the telephone service within India lacks the security and ease of making&#13;
a dial-up connection to make this method of communication between data centers a practical&#13;
proposition over long distances, or even within some of the cities and towns, if unrestricted access&#13;
between centers is a premium. However, dedicated land lines can be effective and are relatively&#13;
low cost when used over relatively short distances. Dial-up connections through NICNET can be&#13;
used for data transfer up to data centerslfrom subordinate offices.&#13;
25.   Transfer of data by floppy disc, through the postal system or hand-carried, is simple and&#13;
effective, but accessibility depends on the decision and dedication of the sender. Hard copies of&#13;
data are easily transferred by facsimile equipment, but the seivice is again totally dependant on the&#13;
sender and use of the data entails re-entry into computel storage.&#13;
26.   All the above described technologies will be used, as appropriate, for transfer of data&#13;
between data centers and for assembly of data from lower level computing facilities into data&#13;
centers. Detailed cost estimates for the various forms of communication linkages using the&#13;
NICNET system are detailed in Table I of this Annex. Figure 3 illustrates the three types of&#13;
NICNET linkages. The communication system is essentially an E-mail system that allows&#13;
exchange of messages as well as data transfer.&#13;
27.   Communications between Data Centres. The national data centers at CWC headquarters in&#13;
Delhi for surface water and at CGWB headquarters, Faiidabad for groundwater are so isolated&#13;
from their regional data centres and from state surface water and groundwater data centers that&#13;
communication with their respective lower level centers will be by the NICNET system. Moreover,&#13;
the national data centers need very firm linkages with their regional office and concerned state data&#13;
centers and, therefore will be provided with dedicated NICNET ground stations. With these&#13;
facilities in place, the national surface water and groundwater data centers will have the capability&#13;
for unrestricted mutual exchange of their data, effectively creating a joint national data bank for&#13;
both surface water and groundwater.&#13;
28.   The CWC's directly subordinate data banks will be with the two regional data centers at&#13;
Hyderabad and Coimbatore. Each of these centers will be equipped with a modem and dedicated&#13;
telephone line connection to the local NICNET ground station for data transfer to the national&#13;
center and exchange with the state surface water data centers. To complete the satellite&#13;
communication links between surface water date centers, the state centers will also be provided&#13;
with modems and dedicated telephone line connections to local NICNET ground stations. In the&#13;
cases of Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh where the surface water and groundwater banking&#13;
systems will be managed within single organizational units in their Water Resources Departments,&#13;
the NICNET connection could function for both surface water and groundwater banks if the&#13;
associated computer facilities for the surface water and groundwater data management systems are&#13;
in very close proximity.&#13;

participating state are located in the same cities as the corresponding CGWB regional office data&#13;
center (a CGWB regional office will be created in Madras with responsibility for the Board's&#13;
activities in Tamil Nadu (see para 9). Thus, it will be possible in these cases to provide lateral&#13;
linkages between corresponding regional office and state groundwater data centers through&#13;
NICNET and ground telephone lines for data exchange, though dedicated lines will be necessary.&#13;
The Nagpur regional office of CGWB (responsible for Maharashtra) will be provided with a&#13;
modem and dedicated ground telephone line to the local NICNET ground station to communicate&#13;
with the state groundwater data center in Pune. With these communication facilities, the CGWB&#13;
regional office in Nagpur will also communicate with the central groundwater data banking system&#13;
in Faridabad.&#13;
30.   The state groundwater data centers will be provided with modems and dedicated land line&#13;
connections with local NICNET ground stations (Tamil Nadu and Madhya Pradesh data centers&#13;
may share the connection with their surface water data centers - para 28). These connections will&#13;
function for upward transfer of data to CGWB's national groundwater data center and for&#13;
exchange of data with the CGWB regional office data centers in the eight states.&#13;
31.   The groundwater data centers that the project will create in the five CGWB regional offices&#13;
with jurisdictions outside the participating sates (para 9) will each be provided with modems and&#13;
dedicated telephone line connections to their local NICNET ground stations for transfer of data to&#13;
the national groundwater data bank at CGWB headquarters.&#13;
32.   Communication at Administrative Levels below Data Centers. As noted (para 15), the&#13;
project plans to initiate data processing in the central and state agencies from Divisional or&#13;
Subdivisional levels for transfer upwards to the respective data centres. In general, dial-up&#13;
telephone connections to NICNET will be provided for upward transfer of data to their superior&#13;
offices and to the data center. Data transfer by floppy disk through the postal system or hand-&#13;
carried will be used as a back-up system if the telephone connection is unreliable at any location.&#13;
Access of User Agencies to Data Banks&#13;
33.   A basic project concept is that hydrological data collection and its management and&#13;
dissemination should be regarded as a service to all eligible users in the public and private sector.&#13;
Thus, all legitimate data users should have clearly defined and easily acquired access to the data.&#13;
Moreover, the data should be made available in formats that are useful to the users. The possibility&#13;
of payment for the service should be considered. However, as note in para 3, the data bases will&#13;
be protected to allow access only on a 'read only' basis, and access will be afforded either by&#13;
'password' in limited situations, or through the center operator after clearance.&#13;
34.   Arranging access for interested government agencies should not present difficulties.&#13;
Provision of easy access to the data bases for legitimate private entities might be more of a&#13;
problem. It is proposed that Hydrology Data User Groups (HDUGs) be established in each of the&#13;
participating the states and at national level as detailed in Appendix I to this Annex. This would&#13;
give prominence to the availability of the data and the means by which it can be accessed, reveal the&#13;
demand for the type of data required and the form of its presentation, and give a channel for&#13;
feedback on the performance of the hydrological service.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Participation of Data Users&#13;
1.    A basic risk with a service project is that the service may not be utilized as expected. For&#13;
this project, there is a risk that user agencies will not fully utilize the improved data bases because&#13;
they do not know that they are available. To alleviate this risk, a special effort would be made to&#13;
ensure that all project data is readily available in the public domain. At present, most project&#13;
agencies are ready to fully disclose data to any eligible and legitimate user. However, a basic&#13;
problem at present is that most data is extremely difficult to access because of the way it is stored&#13;
and because access procedures had never been properly formalized. Furthermore, most potential&#13;
users find great difficulty identifying what data is available. The design of data banks, and the&#13;
processes and procedures for dissemination of data, are specifically formulated to make access&#13;
technically easy (Annex 7).&#13;
2.    To encourage full use of data banks at national and state levels, simple protocol, and wider&#13;
publicized access processes and procedures would be introduced. Thus, an immediate action in&#13;
setting up all project data banks would be to prepare a catalog reporting all location (with maps)&#13;
and listing the quantity and quality of data available for all existing observation sites under the&#13;
jurisdiction of the responsible agency. The catalogs (updated annually) would explain in detail&#13;
how data can be ordered, the cost of access when applicable, and would be widely distributed to a&#13;
comprehensive list of potential 'eligible' and 'legitimate' users. The catalog distribution lists&#13;
would include all the main public and private agencies which may be interested (directly or&#13;
indirectly) in water resources development or management (listed in para 9 below).&#13;
3.    To further encourage use of the data banks, the project agencies would set up Hydrology&#13;
Data User Groups (HDUGs) at national and state levels. The membership of a HDUG would be&#13;
decided on an individual state basis with representation offered to all main 'eligible and legitimate'&#13;
users in the public and private sector entities likely to be regular users of hydrological and&#13;
hydrometeorological data. In this respect, an 'eligible and legitimate user' is defined as any public&#13;
or private entity which can prove need of access to a data bank for any purpose which is deemed to&#13;
be for the public good. Public sector departments expected to be represented on the HDUGs&#13;
would include those with responsibilities related to: irrigation and irrigated agriculture; water&#13;
supply and sanitation; public health; municipalities; industry; fisheries; navigation; road and&#13;
railways; etc. Private sector representation would include: universities and research institutions;&#13;
consultant firms, and NGOs. The implementing agencies would advise IDA of their list of core&#13;
participating agencies to be invited to joint their HDUG and then report progress as one of their&#13;
actions in monitoring of the project. It is envisaged that the membership of a HDUG would be&#13;
flexible and may change as the project proceeds and data demand patterns change.&#13;
4.    HDUGs would be to: advise on ways to publicizing the existence of the data banks and&#13;
what they contain; suggest how to make data banks as user friendly as possible; and provide&#13;
feedback to the 'owners' on the performance of their service and how it may be improved. The&#13;
service agencies will need feedback on the most effective and efficient ways to disseminate data.&#13;
One reporting item would be to record what entities, if any, have been refused access to a data&#13;
bank and why the refusal was made. GOI and the participating states have agreed that they would&#13;
set up, and thereafter maintain, HDUGs with membership and TORs satisfactory to IDA.&#13;

HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Research and Development Activities&#13;
Introduction&#13;
I .    The NIH (Annex 17) has been designated as a primary central agency with a mandate for&#13;
carrying out R&amp;D in hydrology. and for propagating the results of such work} among the state&#13;
agencies. The constitution of NIH allows it to charge for work done on behalf of other&#13;
government agencies. To date, NIH has conicentrated its efforts on surface water hydrology.&#13;
though some geo-hydrological investigations have been undertaken. In addition, as noted in&#13;
Annex 17, the research work of the Institute has not been demand driven in the past. Rather, it&#13;
has reflected the particular interests of the professional staff who designed wid implemented the&#13;
studies. As a consequence, the R&amp;D activities of NIH have made little operational impact on&#13;
hydrology in India.&#13;
2.    The CWPRS (Annex IX) was established in 1916 with a clear mandate for water and&#13;
power related applied researchi, in which hydrology and hiydraulic research were important&#13;
components. This situation continues to the presenit. anid the researcl, station has a recent record&#13;
for can-ying out applied research studies of both surftace water and groulidwater systems,&#13;
particularly by digital modelling techni(ques. The Research Stationi may char-ge clients for the&#13;
work it carries out on their behalf. However, CWPRS appears to make only a limited effort to&#13;
function as a service entity for government agencies and other users, anid to sell its protessional&#13;
expertise and physical assets into a market where there is conisiderable need for such services,&#13;
albeit unexplored and unidentified. As withi NIH, the CWPRS has made little operational&#13;
impact on hydrology in India.&#13;
3.    The CWC and the state water surface agencies carry out little or no hydrological research&#13;
on their own behalf that is not short term and directly project oriented. This reflects their&#13;
historical developments and their perceived pmimary functions of project implementation. By&#13;
contrast, the CGWB and the state groundwater agencies have major basic research components&#13;
built into their mandates in terms of the groundwater exploration and groundwater resource&#13;
evaluation functions that they are intended to carry out. Both central and state groundwater&#13;
agencies are generally well equipped and staffed for exploration activities, and usually have&#13;
active programs. They also undertake special studies including, inte  ia, type basin studies,&#13;
artificial recharge investigations, and aquifer performance enhancement activities - the&#13;
Maharashtra GSDA is particularly active in this respect. But resource evaluation has stagnated&#13;
for more than a decade at the level of applying a set of approved norms to routinely calculate&#13;
groundwater recharge and remaining available resource for development for NABARD&#13;
(National Agriculture and Rural Development Bank). There has been very limited research&#13;
work to appreciate how the prototype aquifer system is actually performing and virtually no&#13;
serious attempts to evaluate groundwater and surface water resources conjunctively on a basin&#13;
or sub-basin basis. In general, these two components of the total resource are evaluated at&#13;
present as if they were independent.&#13;
4.    In addition to the government agencies discussed above, a number of university&#13;
departments and research organizations are engaged in R&amp;D work in the hydrology of surface&#13;
water and groundwater and related water quality investigations. Some of the more important of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
58&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 2&#13;
these agencies are the: (a) Department of Hydrology, University of Roorkee; (b) Civil&#13;
Engineering Departments, Indian Institutes of Technology, New Delhi and Madras; (c) Center&#13;
of Water Resources, Anna University, Madras; (d) Natural Resources Center, Indian Institute of&#13;
Technology, Bombay; and (e) Center of Water Resources Development and Management,&#13;
Kozhikode, Kerala. Also, some state governments have created institutes for water resource&#13;
investigation units which have R&amp;D capabilities which might be utilized by the project - such as&#13;
the Institute of Water Studies under the Tamil Nadu Water Resources Department. In addition,&#13;
some of the states have Irrigation Research Institutes which could undertake R&amp;D studies.&#13;
Research and Development Policy under HP&#13;
5.    The HP will encourage and support demand-driven applied research in all relevant&#13;
aspects of surface water and groundwater hydrology and hydrometry, and in all aspects of water&#13;
quality through funding specifically identified research studies which are approved by a&#13;
specially convened R&amp;D Evaluation Committee to be established under the project (Annex 9,&#13;
para 12)1. The review process would evaluate the cost and potential benefits and impact of any&#13;
R&amp;D study to be funded under the project. The approved applied research activities would then&#13;
be undertaken by the NIH. the CWPRS or any other qualified R&amp;D agency,once the activity has&#13;
been properly identified, described and costed. Some applied research studies to be undertaken&#13;
by CGWB and the state groundwater agencies have been identified and their fundings are&#13;
specified in the detailed project estimates for thie specific agencies.&#13;
6.    Funding for Applied Research. Some Rs. 15.0 and Rs. 5.0 million have been dedicated&#13;
to specific R&amp;D activities to be undertaken by NIH and CWPRS respectively, as described in&#13;
Annexes 17 and 18. The remaining applied research activities to be undertaken under the project&#13;
have not yet to be fully identified. Thus, the funding for these R&amp;D activities has been provided&#13;
as a lump sum allocation of Rs. 20.0 million as detailed in Table I of this Annex. This general&#13;
R&amp;D funding would be administered by the MOWR following the recommendations of the&#13;
R&amp;D Review Committee. The initial allocation of funding for general R&amp;D activities would be&#13;
reviewed by each annual review mission and adjusted accordingly. As described below (para&#13;
7), qualified R&amp;D agencies will be able to draw on the general R&amp;D fund when a study has&#13;
beeii approved by the R&amp;D Review Committee and submitted to IDA for its review and&#13;
comments, if any.&#13;
7.    Identification of Applied Research Studies. As noted (para 5). the applied research that&#13;
could be funded under the project will be identified through a demand-driven process involving&#13;
the central and state surface water and groundwater agencies which will commission the work&#13;
and the research agencies which will undertake the studies. An important prerequisite of project&#13;
supported studies is that they should produce results that would have at least national&#13;
applicability. The R&amp;D activities could include technical and socio-economic and institutional&#13;
evaluation studies. This implies that there will have to be close coordination between the study&#13;
commissioning agencies and the implementing agencies for identification and subsequent&#13;
undertaking of the research studies. In fact, the research agencies will have to strengthen their&#13;
procedures for making contact with the potential client agencies for research topic identification,&#13;
and particularly with the state water resource evaluation agencies.&#13;
8.    As the NIH is in the process of establishing regional offices at key locations in India to&#13;
1     The Research Committee of the Indian National Committee on Hydrology (INCOH) may&#13;
be suitable for this function.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
59&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 3&#13;
support its activities and enhance its capability to make contact with state agencies (as described&#13;
in Annex 17). CWPRS lacks this regional disposition of subordinate offices and will have to&#13;
make special efforts to establish state contacts for research project identification if it is to&#13;
successfully partake in the applied research component of HP. The other R&amp;D agencies (para 4&#13;
above) will be better placed to make contact with client state departments in which they are&#13;
located.&#13;
Scope of Research Studies to be Undertaken&#13;
9.    The possible research subjects outlined below are only indicative of the scope of the&#13;
applied R&amp;D component of the project. However, so far as groundwater is concerned, the&#13;
research will not cover hydrological exploration activities such as exploratory drilling and&#13;
aquifer testing, and geophysical investigations. It is accepted that this cut-off is artificial and&#13;
that such activities produce infornation which becomes part of the hydrological data base. It is&#13;
concluded that to extend of the scope to cover such activities would over-weight HP towards&#13;
geo-hydrology. Thus, the studies will be oriented towards water resource evaluation using&#13;
existing data, in addition to data produced by the groundwater, surface water and&#13;
hydrometeorological networks improved or expanded under the project.&#13;
Technical R&amp;D Studies.&#13;
10.    CWC  and the state surface water agencies are not seriously involved in applied&#13;
hydrological research and this situation is expected to continue except for the studies relating to&#13;
return flows from irrigation to be undertak-en in some states described in para 12.&#13;
11.   CGWB  and--State Groundwater Agencies. The CGWB  and some of the state&#13;
groundwater have ongoing or planned programs in research in such subjects as: (a) small type&#13;
basin water balance studies; (b) artificial recharge; and (c) aquifer performance enhancement&#13;
(para 3). The project will support such ongoing or planned activities, by providing additional&#13;
facilities (observation tubewells and digital water level recorders, soil moisture tensiometers,&#13;
current meters and associated flow measuring devices, and rainfall and climatic observation&#13;
stations), or by financing the entire studies. Of particular interest would be the type basin&#13;
investigations which would lead to an independent method of estimating recharge which does&#13;
not relate directly to seasonal groundwater level fluctuations. The artificial recharge and aquifer&#13;
performance enhancement studies have practical application, particularly for areas of&#13;
groundwater overdraft, and the investigations initiated in Maharashtra and Gujarat give leads on&#13;
how these problems might be tackled. Though the agencies are funded for equipment and data&#13;
collection inputs relating to this R&amp;D work, some state agencies may require assistance with&#13;
data interpretation, and this could be provided by a commissioned agency financed from the&#13;
R&amp;D general fund (para 6).&#13;
12.   Estimation of Retum Flows from Surface Water Irrigation. This type of study has been&#13;
identified as important by several of the participating states, and it is indicated that the work will&#13;
be carried out by the state surface water organizations. However, study descriptions are&#13;
lacking. The project documents provide only the numbers of gauging stations and their&#13;
equipment to be installed on the outfall drains from selected surface water irrigation schemes. It&#13;
appears that the complexity of the problem has not been fully appreciated, with the solution&#13;
requiring an extremely detailed water balance of the selected study area through time.&#13;
Evaluation of the water balance to obtain a credible result will almost certainly require a digital&#13;
modelling exercise covering the irrigation system, and outflow drainage system. The range of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
60&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 4&#13;
data requirements would require a cooperative effort between the surface water and&#13;
groundwater agencies of the concerned states, and the associated modelling exercise would&#13;
perhaps best be carried out with the assistance of a research organization using finance from the&#13;
R&amp;D general fund (para 6).&#13;
13.   Basin/Sub-Basin Water Resource Evaluations. Such studies may have to be restricted to&#13;
basin and sub-basin areas encompassed within the bounds of a single state if problems related to&#13;
inter-state rivalry over surface water data are to be avoided. And the areas chosen for study&#13;
should not be so large that the data bases become unwieldy. However, the need for such&#13;
studies is strongly supported by central government and Bank policies on water resource&#13;
evaluations. Delta areas also present especially complex flow problems, though often with well&#13;
defined boundary conditions. The studies could be restricted to surface water flows, but&#13;
inclusion of the underlying-groundwater systems would provide a more complete picture. The&#13;
studies would almost certainly involve digital modelling. They would best be carried out as a&#13;
cooperative exercise involving the state agency(s) and a research organization.&#13;
14.   Reservoir Operation Studies. This type of investigation again fits in with identified&#13;
inputs to several of the state programs to provide instrumentation and gate rating calibrations to&#13;
obtain better information on reservoir inflows, storages and releases. The studies should result&#13;
in improved reservoir operating rules to obtain specified and possibly multi-purpose objectives,&#13;
including responses to flood conditions. Such studies involve the use of complex computer&#13;
programs and would best be carried out as joint exercises between the concerned state surface&#13;
water agency and a research organization.&#13;
15.   Flood Forecasting Studies. Such studies may be extremely specialized and typically&#13;
result in models which may be operated to evaluate real-time rainfall and run-off data during a&#13;
recognizably dangerous flood event. They can be used for flood warning in areas in jeopardy&#13;
and for reservoir operation under flood conditions. Orissa has a specifically identified a study of&#13;
floods on the Brahmani river system which will also give guidance for installation of a real-time&#13;
flood observation network which will also be financed under the project (Annex 25). A similar&#13;
exercise is planned for the Tarnbraparani river in Tamil Nadu (Annex 26). Provisions for these&#13;
studies and the specialized consultancy inputs required to develop the flood forecasting models&#13;
are specifically identified in the project cost estimates for the programs in these states.&#13;
However, either NIH or CWPRS or any other qualified research agency could be involved&#13;
cooperatively with the state agencies in implementing the studies with consultant assistance.&#13;
16.   Evaluation of Advanced Hydrometric Equipment. The CWPRS is mandated as the lead&#13;
agency in India on surface water hydrometric instrumentation and equipment. The CWC and&#13;
Karnataka plan to import and install Broadband Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers on an&#13;
experimental basis. It is evident that CWPRS should be involved with the suppliers and the&#13;
agencies in installation and demonstration of the equipments and subsequent operation. The&#13;
output should be a clear evaluation of the advantages and disadvantages of the equipment in the&#13;
Indian operational environment, and recommendations of the applicability of the equipment to&#13;
specific river flow monitoring situations in India. Producing the evaluation report should be the&#13;
task of CWPRS.&#13;
17.   Water Pollution Studies. The project will provide advanced equipment for the two&#13;
regional laboratories of CWC in Hyderabad and Coimbatore, the 13 regional or sub-regional&#13;
laboratories of CGWB, and the central laboratories of the state water agencies (Annex 5). The&#13;
equipment will permit analyses of dangerous chemical and biological pollutants as well as the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
61&#13;
Annex 8&#13;
Page 5&#13;
more standard chemical evaluations now being undertaken. Once this equipment becomes&#13;
operational, it will allow studies of pollution of surface water and groundwater to be undertaken&#13;
in a systematic manner.&#13;
18.   In this respect, the water agencies in India have limited experience in the evaluation of&#13;
water chemistry and biology information, particularly with regard to the pollution aspects. As&#13;
an example, there is no base-line study from which the impact of the last three or four decades&#13;
of using fertilizer, herbicides and pesticides oil the quality of groundwater and surface water can&#13;
be measured. The relatively recent published occurrence of widespread (natural) arsenic&#13;
pollution is shallow aquifers in West Bengal has left that state searching for solutions. Fluoride&#13;
excesses in groundwater supplies are better identified. Monitoring programs to detect pollution&#13;
trends in surface waters have yet to be devised and put in place. Studies of the pollution effects&#13;
on suspended solids and biomass which later accumulates in reservoirs, lakes and estuaries are&#13;
yet to be undertaken. And point source pollution of both suiface water and groundwater with a&#13;
range of toxic chemicals is known to be widespread. but has received limited attention in terms&#13;
of identification, amelioration and effective regulations. A fuller description of water pollution&#13;
problems is given in Annex 5. Related studies would be undertaken by a commissioned agency&#13;
financed from the R&amp;D general fund (para 6).&#13;
19.   Pollution Studies. Although the pollution and environment related problems of water&#13;
resources are known to be severe, there is no well established agency with the capability to&#13;
implement applied research studies in this subject. The project will therefore undertake&#13;
specialized training of professional chemists and provide specialized consultants to assist with&#13;
the training (Annex 10). SubseqLuently, specific water quality related studies will be defined and&#13;
designed with the help of the consultants, and undertaken by the staff of CWC, CGWB and the&#13;
state water agencies with the help of specialized research agencies.&#13;
Institutional Strengthening Studies.&#13;
20.   In addition to technical and scientific determinants to be researched and developed under&#13;
the project, an important activity will be to undertake R&amp;D to strengthen the concerned&#13;
institutions. Areas that would benefit from specialized R&amp;D include: quality control processes&#13;
and procedures; management efficiency and office administration; all aspects of data&#13;
dissemination; and monitoring and evaluation of project impact. The project would support&#13;
related studies to be undertaken by consultants, research institutes or universities financed from&#13;
the R&amp;D general fund (para 6) and under terms of reference satisfactory to IDA. All studies&#13;
would be expected to result in generic recommendations which would have national&#13;
applicability.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Institutional Strenigthening&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The underlying challenge facing India in all aspects of hydiology is the need to substantially&#13;
strengthen the institutions involved so that they call etfectively and efficiently undertake their mandated&#13;
tasks. For surface water (SW) hydrology in all r iver basins within the project area, the facilities and&#13;
procedures need to be upgraded and expanded for measuring stream Flows and monitoring diversions&#13;
and reservoir storages, and for estimating sedineni loads and monitoring water quality. In addition,&#13;
the SW data that are available are not always published or otherwise readily accessible. On the other&#13;
hand, the basic data collection procedures ftor grounidwater (GW) are well detinied, and the monitoring&#13;
and other data collection systems are fairly adequ0ate aiid well managed by CGWB and most State&#13;
Groundwater Organizations (SGOs). l]owever.the processes and proceduri-es need to be strengthened&#13;
through which basic GW  data relatinig to the comnplex flow, storage. recharge, an(d discharge&#13;
mechanlisms, and water (quality relationships of groundwater systems are anialyzed to provide estimates&#13;
of groundwater resource availability.&#13;
Organization and Staffing of Hydrological Institutions&#13;
2 .    Institutional BackgroUIld. Development of surface water resources in India has been&#13;
dominated since the 1850s by the need to create large public sector irrigatlioni schemes to secure and&#13;
increase food produictioln to support the gr'owinlg popuilation .Planning anid design of large riverl&#13;
diversion structures, their appurtenant cianal systems and any supporting reservoir storages, reqLuired&#13;
knowledge of the hydrological characteristics of the rivers on which they were placed.  Thus,&#13;
hydrological skills were first developed in the state Public Worlks Departments which also had&#13;
responsibilities for roads and road bridges, flood control and drainage.  With the formation of&#13;
Irrigation Departments in many states (and later Water ResouLrces Depairtmenits), the main responsibility&#13;
for collection of surface water data was retained with these entities. The Central Water and Power&#13;
Commission (CWPC) - the forer-unner of the Central Watel Coimiissioni (CWC) within the Ministry&#13;
of Water Resources (MOWR) - was created in 1953 as the central governiment agency to provide&#13;
technical advice for direction of central funding support and design clearance to state irrigation and&#13;
hydropower development projects. And hydrological skills were required within the CWC to carry out&#13;
its mandate.&#13;
3.     The massive development of groundwater irrigation by the private sector using motorized&#13;
pumps, which was initiated in the 1960s, required creation of a strong central agency and of state&#13;
agencies for oversight of the activity, particularly when large scale institutional credit programs were&#13;
established to support the development from the beginning of the 1970s. The Central Ground Water&#13;
Board (CGWB), now under MOWR, was established as the central apex agency for groundwater in&#13;
1972, and almost all the states with significant groundwater potential and the need to develop the&#13;
resource had established SGOs during the period 1970-73. While most of the SGOs were originally&#13;
established in Departments of Irrigation or Departments of Public Works with irrigation mandates2, the&#13;
I      Until the end of the l9th century, navigation on rivcrs, irrigation canals and single purpose navigation&#13;
canals was an important use of water resources, but this declined rapidly early in the 20th century.&#13;
2      Karnataka was unusual in placing its SGO in the Departrnent of Mines and Geology where it still remains.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
64&#13;
Annex 9&#13;

organizations have evolved and changed their jurisdictions to meet the perceived requirements of their&#13;
particular state governments.&#13;
4.    The collection of hydrometeorological data, suiface water and groundwater hydrological data,&#13;
and water quality data in the various river basins of the country is being handled by several central&#13;
agencies and many state agencies. The responsibilities of the central agencies are well defined and do&#13;
not materially overlap in the data collection activities. However, at state levels, several agencies are&#13;
often involved in collecting the same type of data to standards that are defined by their own perceived&#13;
requirements. This is the situation in the case of hydrometeorological data where state irrigation,&#13;
agriculture, revenue or administrative departments and command areas development (CAD) authorities&#13;
may be found operating rainfall and climatic observation networks within the jurisdiction of a state.&#13;
Similarly, water quality monitoring may be carried out independently by state agencies such as the&#13;
departments of public health and irrigation, the municipal water supply authorities, the SGOs and the&#13;
pollution control boards (PCBs). In this situation. collection methodologies vary considerably and&#13;
there may be no uniformity in the data collected for common parameters.&#13;
National Institutions&#13;
5 .    The four organizations at central level with a mandate to monitor hydrological parameters and&#13;
interpret the data collected are: (i) the CWC with responsibility for surfaze water hydrology; (ii) the&#13;
CGWB with responsibility for groundwater hydrology; (iii) the India Meteorological Department&#13;
(IMD) which collects data on all aspects of climate; and (iv) the Central Pollution Control Board&#13;
(CPCB) under the Ministry of Environment (MOE) which includes all aspects of pollution under its&#13;
very broad mandate. The CPCB is a new entity which relatively receoitly started to establish water&#13;
quality observation networks under its own juiisdiction to support its regulatoty function.&#13;
6.    Central Water Commission. The CWC. established in 1953. has responsibility for maintaining&#13;
a network of hydrological gauging stations and rainfalUclimatic stations in the major r iver basins. The&#13;
Commission has its headquarters in New Delhi and operates through five regional offices under Chief&#13;
Engineers (CE). It has responsibility for maintaining a network of river gauging stations in all the river&#13;
basins of India within its broader mandate. Its field operations for hydrology are under five regional&#13;
offices headed by Chief Engineers (CE), and the offices at Hyderabad (South Central Region) and at&#13;
Coimbatore (Southern Region) have between them responsibility for surface water hydrology of the&#13;
basins in the eight states which will participate in HP. Among their other responsibilities, the regional&#13;
and subordinate offices are required to provide flood forecasting services for their basin rivers. The&#13;
offices at Hyderabad (South Central Region) and at Coimbatore (South Region) have, between them,&#13;
responsibility for the surface water hydrology of the basins in the eight states which will participate in&#13;
the project. The Chairman, CWC, heads the organization, is assisted by four Members in charge of&#13;
Design and Research, River Management, Water Planning, and Planning and Progress. The regional&#13;
CEs have responsibility for all collection and interpretation of river flow data from the CWC gauging&#13;
stations, and for flood forecasting and reservoir inflow forecasts for the basins under their jurisdiction.&#13;
The organizational arrangement of the CWC project program is described in Annex 15.&#13;
7.    The organizational structure of CWC for collection and management of surface water&#13;
hydrological data is well defined and will not require significant modification for implementation of&#13;
HP. Strengthening of procedures for data collection and verification in the lower echelons of the&#13;
agency will be required as will procedures for computerized storage of data from the subdivision level&#13;
upward. The facilities and staffing for monitoring water quality on the river systems will require&#13;
strengthening. The Commission will require the establishment of regional and a central surface water&#13;
data banks (Annex 7), which can properly interact with data banking systems established by the states&#13;
through clearly defined data transfer systems. Some staff increases will be required, particularly for&#13;
the laboratories, but most upgrading of skills will be acquired through the training component of the&#13;
project (Annex 10).&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 9&#13;

8.    Central Ground Water Board. The CGWB was established in 1972 and its headquarters is&#13;
located at Faridabad, near New Delhi. The organization is subdivided from the apex into two wings--&#13;
Hydrogeological and Engineering. Most of the activities under the project will fall within the&#13;
responsibilities of the Hydrogeological Wing, excepting construction of observation of tubewells. The&#13;
tasks of the Hydrogeological Wing include groundwater exploration, groundwater resource evaluation&#13;
(which involves maintenance of nationwide groundwater level and groundwater quality monitoring&#13;
networks), and publication of hydrogeological information in the form of maps and reports. The&#13;
Hydrogeological Wing has Directorates in 12 regional offices, seven of which are located in the project&#13;
area at: (i) Bhubaneswar with responsibility for Orissa; (ii) Hyderabad with responsibility for Andhra&#13;
Pradesh and Tamil Nadu; (iii) Bangalore with responsibility for Karnataka; (iv) Nagpur with&#13;
responsibility for Maharashtra; (v) Ahmedabad with responsibility for Gujarat; (vi) Trivandrum with&#13;
responsibility for Kerala: and (vii) Bhopal with responsibility for Madhya Pradesh. The regional&#13;
offices with jurisdiction outside the eight peninsula states are located at Jaipur, Chandigarh, Lucknow,&#13;
Calcutta, and Guwahati. The tasks of the Hydrogeological Wing include groundwater exploration,&#13;
groundwater resource evaluation, maintenance of a nationwide groundwater level and quality network.&#13;
scrutiny of state groundwater development projects prepared, and publication of hydrogeological&#13;
information in the form of reports and maps. The organizational arrangement of the CGWB project&#13;
program is described in Annex 16.&#13;
9.    The only major change in the existing organizational structure of CGWB for project&#13;
implementation will be raising the status of the Madras unit office to a Regional Directorate with charge&#13;
of Tamil Nadu. Modifications of staffing will be required for: (a) servicing the improved observation&#13;
networks; (b) servicing the improved laboratory facilities to be provided in the regional offices; and (c)&#13;
servicing the data banking facilities to be provided in the regional offices and in the CGWB&#13;
headquarters, Faridabad. Some specialist incremental staff will be required together with additional&#13;
drivers. Otherwise, improved skills will be acquired through the training programs proposed for the&#13;
project (Annex 10).&#13;
10.   Other Central Agencies under MOWR. There are two national agencies under MOWR which,&#13;
although not directly involved in collection of hydrological data, have mandates to carry out research&#13;
and provide services for various aspects of hydrology. The National Institute of Hydrologv (NIH),&#13;
and The Central Water and Power Research Station (CWPRS). The project would also strengthen&#13;
these two institutions and the organizational arrangements of the NIH and CWPRS project programs&#13;
are described in Annexes 17 and 18 respectively.&#13;
I.   The NIH was established as a Registered Society in 1978 under MOWR with a very wide&#13;
mandate in hydrology, covering research, consultancy for other government agencies and technology&#13;
transfer. The NIH is now in the process of establishing subcenters at various key localities, including&#13;
Belgaum, Kakinada and Sagar located in the project area. The Institute is funded through the MOWR&#13;
and has a very wide mandate in the field of hydrology. It is intended that about 60% of its budget&#13;
should be applied to research, 20% to consultancy work for other government agencies and 20% to&#13;
technology transfer. NIH provided the Secretariat for the High Level Technical Committee on&#13;
Hydrology (HILTECH) established by MOWR in 1982 which identified the need for the proposed&#13;
project . NIH also provides the Secretariat for the Asian Regional Coordinating Committee on&#13;
Hydrology (ARCCOH) with its headquarters at Roorkee.&#13;
12.   The main functions of NIH under the project would be to assist with the general training;&#13;
provide training in advanced hydrological/hydrogeological technologies to professional staff and to&#13;
provide R&amp;D inputs to the project through consultancies (Annex 8). These requirements are within its&#13;
present mandate of NIH. However at present, research under NIH tends to be supply driven. This&#13;
focus would be changed under the project with R&amp;D activities designed to be mainly demand driven&#13;
(Annex 17). Thus, NIH will have to develop in-house expertise in advanced hydrological and(&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
66&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 4&#13;
hydrogeological technologies which are operationally useful to the states and practically useful to&#13;
potential users. This will not impose significant organizational or staffing changes on NIH, but it will&#13;
require a basic change the selection of research subjects and for marketing the Institute's skills.&#13;
13.   The CWPRS, located at Pune, was established in 1916 and provides general research services&#13;
to three main sectors of the economy--irrigation, hydropower and water transport. Clients are charged&#13;
for services provided. The organization CWPRS is described in Annex 18. The functions of CWPRS&#13;
under the project would be to provide specialized services relating to hydrological instrumentation and&#13;
to provide related technology transfer to the states on a demand basis (Annex 8). These would not&#13;
require any changes to the existing organization of the agency.&#13;
India Meteorological Department.&#13;
14.   The IMD, under the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST), was established in 1875&#13;
and is one of the oldest and most effective scientific departments in the country. The organizational&#13;
arrangement of the IMD project program is described in Annex 19. The IMD has its headquarters in&#13;
New Delhi, a technical headquarters and main data bank in Pune, operates through five regional&#13;
meteorological centers located in New Delhi, Calcutta, Bombay, Madras and Nagpur, and has&#13;
meteorological centers in all otlher project state capitals. The Department has its own networks for&#13;
recording rainfall and all important climatic parameters. and it also utilizes rainfall data collected from&#13;
approved stations operated by other agencies. It operates radars for detection of cyclones and&#13;
thunderstorms and makes upper air observations and air pollution measurements. Special importance&#13;
is given to rainfall measurements and data from some 5,00() rain gauge stations are stored on computer&#13;
files (in a central data bank located in Pune). Copies of rainfall and other climatic data can be obtained&#13;
on demand for a small fee. Individual states have responsibility for publication of their own rainfall&#13;
and other climatic data. The IMD caters to the needs of a large number of interests, notably to the&#13;
requirements of aviation, shipping, agriculture and irrigation, flood forecasting and large reservoir&#13;
operations, and cooperates with several other countries to study global weather circulation. No&#13;
organizational changes would be required for IMD's role under the project.&#13;
Project State Institutions.&#13;
15.   State SW  Hydrological Institutions. At State Government level, the responsibility for&#13;
maintaining hydrometric networks for surface river flow observations and for interpretation of the data&#13;
collected rests almost entirely with line departments which are primarily involved in irrigation. This&#13;
reflects the fact that, in most states, surface water development has been dominated by the need to&#13;
design and operate irrigation systems and to create the reservoir storages for regulation of supplies to&#13;
these facilities. Thus, the posting of a professional civil engineer to work in hydrology units is&#13;
generally regarded as a temporary arrangement. The organizational arrangements for carrying out&#13;
surface water hydrology work vary widely between the departments of the various states. However, it&#13;
is noteworthy that surface water hydrology is never the responsibility of a free-standing unit within a&#13;
non-user department which has a mandate to provide a hydrological service on a state-wide basis. The&#13;
organizational arrangements for carrying out surface water hydrological works in each of the seven&#13;
participating states are described in Annexes 20 to 26.&#13;
16.   State Surface Water Organizations (SWOs). As noted previously, surface water hydrology in&#13;
the states is vested in organizations with a major responsibility for surface water irrigation which&#13;
regard hydrological information mainly as an input to design of irrigation schemes and related&#13;
structures. Thus, river flow observation sites were selected for project specific reasons and were&#13;
often regarded as temporary. Furthermore, surface water hydrology activities are typically embedded&#13;
in design units, or, even worse, scattered within the jurisdictions of several circles or CEs with&#13;
construction and/or O&amp;M as their major responsibilities. Surface water hydrology has never beenl&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
67&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 5&#13;
regarded as the clearly defined mandate of a free standing unit within an Irrigation or Public Works&#13;
Department. This situation persists in various forms in all the participating states.&#13;
17.   Institutional Challenge with SWOs. Reflecting the above described historical approach to&#13;
hydrological data collection, hydrology is not treated as a specialist subject. Most state surface water&#13;
hydrology units are staffed with generalist civil engineers who often are not given specific training in&#13;
the subject. Postings of professional staff for hydrological duties tend to be temporary. Even when&#13;
officers have received specialist training in hydrology, there is no certainty that they will be used for&#13;
this work. And the career structure of professional staff is such that there is not reward for continuity&#13;
in specialist posts. In the circumstances, it is not surprising that most professional engineers do not&#13;
place high regard on postings to supervise hydrological field units. Since there are few specialists to&#13;
set standards, the performance expected from supporting technical staff tends to be low and these staff&#13;
generally receive inadequate on-the-job training. This is reflected in the quality of the data collection&#13;
processes and the degree to which data is validated. Surface water quality data collection is at best,&#13;
afforded only limited importance (and then relating mainly to irrigation water quality) and, at worst,&#13;
almost entirely ignored.&#13;
18.   The inter-related problems of organization and staffing for surface water hydrology agencies&#13;
must be addressed if the overall objectives of the project are to be achieved. The organizational&#13;
problem is proposed to be resolved as an interim solution for the project by the creation of a free&#13;
standing surface water hydrology circle. or even a surface water and groundwater organization under a&#13;
CE, as in the cases of Madhya Pradesh (Annex 23) and Tamil Nadu (Annex 26). The solution to the&#13;
staffing problem is evident - specialist professional staff should be recruited or existing staff should be&#13;
trained, and these officers should then be provided with a career structure and, if possible, incentives&#13;
so that they can be retained in hydrology units. But creation of the required skills will take time. A&#13;
solution to the basic challenge that few engineers wish make a career in hydrology would be to recruit&#13;
appropriately qualified persons in scientist grades,so that these staff cannot be transferred to general&#13;
civil engineering duties. The staffing of the laboratories will require recruitment of both professional&#13;
and technical specialists who will benefit from specialized training under the project.&#13;
19.   State Institutions (Groundwater) The massive development of groundwater for irrigation by&#13;
the private sector using motorized pumps, which was initiated in the 1960s, required creation of state&#13;
agencies for oversight of the activities. By the early 1970s, all the states of India with significant&#13;
groundwater resources and the need to develop their groundwater resources for irrigation had&#13;
established SGOs. In all states, the evaluation and monitoring of the resources--i.e., groundwater&#13;
hydrology and hydrometry--are major activities in the mandates of these organizations. However,&#13;
their mandates have also included design (or clearance) of groundwater development schemes which&#13;
would typically be implemented in the public sector directly supervised by them or their parent&#13;
organization. In this respect, the data collection units are part of user agencies.&#13;
20.   Stat GroundwateLOrganizations (SGOs).3 Common characteristics of all SGOs are that they&#13;
were created to support groundwater development and they are staffed mainly with hydrogeologists or&#13;
other related skills in scientist grades. Though all SGOs retain some water user functions, their&#13;
hydrogeological data collecting activities are generally clearly defined so that they can properly fulfill&#13;
their requirements in support of HP. While most of the SGOs were originally established within&#13;
irrigation departments (Karnataka was unusual in placing its organization in the Department of Mines&#13;
and Geology), the agencies have evolved and changed their jurisdictions to meet the perceived&#13;
requirements of their particular states. Taking the participating states as examples: Orissa's SGO is&#13;
now a branch of a state cororation for minor irrigation development under the Department of Rural&#13;
Development; Gujarat's SG0 is also part of a similar state corporation under the Narmada and Water&#13;
3      See state specific details in respective Annexes 20 to 26, SDV.&#13;

Annex 9&#13;
Page 6&#13;
Resources Department; Andhra Pradesh's SGO is a free-standing entity reporting directly to the&#13;
Secretary for Irrigation and Command Area Development; Maharashtra's SGO is a directorate within&#13;
the Rural Development Department; Madhya Pradesh's SGO is a circle within the Water Resources&#13;
Department; Kerala's SGO is a department reporting to the Secretary of the Irrigation Department; and&#13;
in Tamil Nadu, the SGO is now a wing under a CE in the Public Works Department.&#13;
21.   The common characteristic of all SGOs is that they were created to support groundwater&#13;
development and they are staffed mainly with hydrogeologists or other scientists who were recruited&#13;
directly into the agencies. In general, the career prospects of the professional staff are restricted to&#13;
within the groundwater organizations with which they serve. Thus the SGOs (unlike the surface water&#13;
hydrology organizations) can develop, through staff training and experience, a cadre of groundwater&#13;
specialists who may be expected to remain with the agency for their entire government service.&#13;
Moreover, the SGOs of the participating states are organizationally strong and fairly well staffed with&#13;
specialists, with some exceptions in the case of chemists. Because of the recruitment history pattern of&#13;
employing scientists, the SGOs have been able to retain staff and build up cadres of groundwater&#13;
specialists through training and experience. Nevertheless. SGOs with irrigation or public works&#13;
departments often have the most senior staff posts restricted to civil engineers who can be posted&#13;
within the department to fill promotion opportunities. or for other reasons. Apart from the&#13;
disadvantage of discontinuity in the senior posts, this practice stunts the career prospects of the&#13;
groundwater specialists.&#13;
22.   In order to meet the needs of the greater workloads and of the additional skills imposed by HP,&#13;
the SGOs will have to employ some additional stafl, primarily for servicing the improved groundwater&#13;
monitoring networks, to support the expanded and/or improved laboratory facilities, and to establish&#13;
the state groundwater data centers. Other staff improvements will be provided through the proposed&#13;
training programs (Annex I0).&#13;
23.   State Organizations involved in Hydrometeorologv. Systematic observation of the spatial and&#13;
temporal variations of meteorological parameters, and particularly of rainfall, has a long history at state&#13;
level in India because these climatic variables impact so broadly on the economy. Administrative and&#13;
revenue departments were among the first to establish rainfall networks and often retain responsibility&#13;
for publication of state rainfall data. The agriculture departments had an obvious interest in historical&#13;
and current weather information and established networks of climatic and rainfall stations. In addition,&#13;
the irrigation departments required climatic and rainfall data for developing rainfall-runoff relationships&#13;
in river basins and for design and operation of irrigation systems. Some combination of the above-&#13;
mentioned departments continue to maintain climatic and/or rainfall observation networks in most&#13;
states of India, including the states which will participate in the project (Annex 6, Table 1). The&#13;
coordination between the IMD (para 14 above) and the state hydrometeorological agencies needs to be&#13;
substantially strengthened.&#13;
24.   State Pollution Control Boards. PCBs are now established in most states of India, and their&#13;
mandates include monitoring of the quality of waters in the rivers, lakes and groundwater systems, as&#13;
well as applying regulations relating to the quality of waste water discharge to these systems.&#13;
However, these agencies are newly created and often poorly staffed and funded. They have not yet&#13;
established statewide water quality monitoring networks which are capable of providing a regional&#13;
synthesis of the quality of the waters in the surface water and groundwater systems. The PCBs, as&#13;
users of water quantity and quality data, will not participate actively in HP. Again, the coordination&#13;
between the state agencies water quantity and quality data (para 14 above) and the PCBs needs to be&#13;
substantially strengthened.&#13;
&#13;

Modifications of Existing Organizations&#13;
25.   An important project concept is that responsibility for basic data collection on surface water&#13;
and groundwater resources, establishment of national and state level data bases, and dissemination of&#13;
this information to all legitimate user entities should, so far as is possible, be placed with agencies at&#13;
central and state levels which do not have direct responsibilities for developing water resources (2.06).&#13;
The IMD fulfills these requirements perfectly as a central agency responsible for hydrometeorological&#13;
information, and CWC and CGWB do not have direct physical development functions.&#13;
26.   Major changes in organizational structures will not be necessary to achieve an acceptable level&#13;
of separation of responsibility for hydrological data collection, storage and dissemination from the&#13;
responsibility of the water user agencies. The two agencies with data base creation functions at the&#13;
center--the CWC for surface water and CGWB for groundwater--are non-user agencies reporting to&#13;
the MOWR. The SGOs of the participating states generally have the required level of autonomy within&#13;
their parent agencies to perform their tasks with regard to groundwater data without excessive&#13;
exposure to outside pressures and bias. However, some important organizational changes have been&#13;
agreed with state surface water hydrology units to achieve the necessary levels of independence. In this&#13;
respect, Madhya Pradesh has created a freestanding hydrology unit dealing with both grouLndwater and&#13;
surface water under an independent CE in its DOWR. The reorganization of the Tarnil Nadu PWD to&#13;
form a DOWR will result in a similar free-standing unit under a CE with responsibility for surface&#13;
water and groundwater hydrology. These arrangements could be model to follow in all states where&#13;
groundwater and surface water evaluation entities are within a single agency. The organizations that&#13;
will implement the state programs are discussed in the Annexes 20 to 26.&#13;
27.   A major challenge will be persuading the agencies at central and state levels to the understand&#13;
the benefits of making the computerized data bases created interactive between data banks and easily&#13;
accessible to all legitimate data users. But it must be understood that restrictions will not be placed on&#13;
user agencies collecting hydrological data for their own specific purposes. The data bases are intended&#13;
as reference sources for the most commonly required hydrological information.&#13;
Arrangements for Institutional Strengthein&#13;
29.   Given the complexity of institutional and management challenges, and the number of agencies&#13;
involved in the project, a flexible, responsive, approach would be applied for the purpose. Thus, it is&#13;
recommended that project implementation and the interrelated strengthening of capabilities of each&#13;
participating central and state agency be steered and managed through a "Process Approach" to project&#13;
management (eloborated with the assistance of specialists from DGIS - Netherlands and ODA - UK).&#13;
The concept of the approach is that, while the general objectives and direction of the project are&#13;
defined, the specific work programs will need continuous monitoring, feedback from users and&#13;
adaptations as experience is gained and lessons are learned. The project activities would be phased&#13;
into manageable portions and a clear set of objectives for each year in light of overall objectives would&#13;
be defined. By allowing changes in the project process after each annual review, and in the design of&#13;
annual plans, a flexible strategy is envisaged, responsive to technical and institutional development&#13;
objectives, and user feedback. The process approach is also characterized by built-in flexibility in&#13;
project implementation and by the ability to learn and adjust through experience gained, progress&#13;
made, and feed-back from  users and stakeholder.  Implementation of the project, including&#13;
procurement and disbursement, would be planned and organized for the forthcoming year based on&#13;
outcome of the feed-back on the past year's experience, and tailored to each participating agencies'&#13;
stage of institutional development and capability (detailed in Chapter V of the SAR).&#13;
30.   A flexible and process-oriented approach requires strong coordination of activities and&#13;
management of the project both at the Central and the State Government level. A strong steering&#13;
mechanism would be developed to enable the project to be well directed and controlled. The Annu;l&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 9&#13;
Page 8&#13;
Project Review (APR), Annual Project Evaluation and Updating Process (APEUP) would provide an&#13;
effective basis for an on-going dialogue between the Indian authorities and IDA about the physical and&#13;
institutional progress made under the project and for adjustments in the work program as required. The&#13;
sequence of the APR and APEUP approach to monitoring project management is shown schematically&#13;
Figure I of this annex and described below.&#13;
(a)   "Hvdrology Institutional Development Action Plan" (HIDAP) prepared by each institution&#13;
involved would be monitored through an annual " Hydrology Institutional Development&#13;
Review" (HIDR) focusing on the management, organizational, and institutional&#13;
development aspects of the project to be carried out by each state and central agency.&#13;
The Physical and Procurement Plan (PPP) for a year would be reviewed annually based  on&#13;
the progress achieved in the preceding year through continuous M&amp;E procedure supported by&#13;
the consultants (Annex 11).&#13;
(b)   Feedback on user orientation and satisfaction with hydrological information system would be&#13;
obtained through establishment of Hvdroloay Data User Groups (HDUG) at central and&#13;
state levels with representation of all agencies which have a legitimate interest in the&#13;
output of the project. The conveners of the HDUGs would organize annual Hydrology&#13;
Development Workshops (HDW), the recommendations of which would be considered by&#13;
HIDR.&#13;
(c)   The integrated Institutional Development and Physical &amp; Procurement Plans would be&#13;
jointly reviewed by the Indian Authorities and the Bank in Annual Project Review (APR)&#13;
Establishment of a National Coordination Committee (NCC) and including its&#13;
Secretariat which will also be responsible for overall monitoring and evaluation while State&#13;
Project Coordination Committee (SPCC) within each participating state including a unit in&#13;
each responsible for monitoring and evaluation of the physical implementation and&#13;
institutional development components of the project.&#13;
(d)   The key elements and findings through experience of the project implementation and&#13;
management will be discussed and HIDAP and PPP would be updated for the next year of&#13;
project implementation (see Fig. I of this Annex). The APR would be implemented before&#13;
the end of December in each project year.&#13;
The process and procedures for the setting up and maintaining the above steps would be agreed in&#13;
principle by the Project Launch Mission and then detailed and implemented with the assistance of the&#13;
ploject consultants.&#13;
Proposed Institutional Strengthening Provisions.&#13;
31.    Improved Systems for Data Management (Annex 7). The project plans to improve the data&#13;
management systems employed by CWC, CGWB and the state agencies responsible for collection&#13;
and storage of data relating to surface water and groundwater resources and the water quality aspects&#13;
of the resources. At present, the CWC makes fairly extensive use of computers for storage and&#13;
processing of data collected from its hydrometric networks. The software used has been developed by&#13;
CWC. The raw stream flow data collected are processed on computers at divisional level, and the&#13;
processed data are then transferred upwards through the concerned circle and regional offices and&#13;
finally to a central data base at CWC headquarters, New Delhi. In general, SWOs have made only&#13;
limited advances in the use of computers for surface water data storage and processing.&#13;
32.    The CGWB makes use of computers at its Faridabad headquarters and in its regional offices&#13;
for storage of groundwater data collected from its countrywide/state monitoring networks. The data&#13;
storage systems software were developed by CGWB. But the systems' capabilities are limited to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
71&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 9&#13;
storage of water level change data and water quality data out of a very wide range of hydrogeological&#13;
data which are on paper files, generally in the regional offices. Some of SGOs have made&#13;
considerable progress in use of computers for storage and processing groundwater data, again limited&#13;
mainly to water level change data and water quality data collected from their groundwater monitoring&#13;
networks. However, the programs used by CGWB and the SGOs for data storage and processing are&#13;
not necessarily compatible.&#13;
33.    Establishment of Interactive Data Banks. A project objective is to develop interactive&#13;
computerized data management systems for surface water data in the CWC and the state SWOs, and&#13;
for groundwater data in the CGWB and the SGOs. State-of-the-art data management software will be&#13;
selected and procured for surface water, groundwater and water quality data for use by the concerned&#13;
agencies at central and state levels. Each agency will create a data banking system for the information&#13;
it collects. But, because the same softwares for data management are to be used by the central and&#13;
state agencies, seamless systems for exchange of data become possible.&#13;
34.    Entry of data to the computerized storage system will begin at the lowest level practical in&#13;
each data collection agency, most commonly at the division level or equivalent. In the case of the&#13;
states, data will be transferred upwards through the command hierarchy to the state centers where data&#13;
banks for surface water and for groundwater will be created. The CGWB Regional Directorate's&#13;
jurisdictions in the participating states overlap perfectly with the state jurisdictions. With this&#13;
situation, it is planned to create regional office data banks for groundwater information collected by&#13;
CGWB. The regional office centers will have arrangements for upward transfer of copies of that data&#13;
to a central groundwater data bank at CGWB headquarters, Faridabad, and lateral exchange of data&#13;
with their corresponding state dati center. The geographic distribution of CWC's field organization,&#13;
being based on basin areas, does not fit precisely with state jurisdictions. A data transfer arrangement&#13;
from divisions through circles and regional offices to CWC headquarters for the establishment of a&#13;
central surface water data bank is not problematic. But it will also be necessary to establish&#13;
intermediate surface water data banks in the regional offices of CWC for exchange of data with&#13;
concerned state agencies.&#13;
35.    Efficacy of Data Exchange. A basic premise of the concept of establishing interactive data&#13;
management systems is that this will lead to mutual exchange of data between the concerned central&#13;
and state agencies. At present, data collected by central and state agencies within a common area has&#13;
tended to be regarded as the exclusive property of the collecting agency, through groundwater data&#13;
has never been so carefully protected as surface water data. With a mutual exchange of information&#13;
system in place, data anomalies and inconsistencies will be more easily recognized, and the larger&#13;
information set resulting from combining the data bases should provide a better basis for decision&#13;
making. Past experience indicates that exchange of groundwater data between and states and CGWB&#13;
should not be problematic as interstate conflicts over this part of the water resource have not arisen.&#13;
Given the typical rivalry between riparian states which share surface water in a basin and the&#13;
constitutional status of water as a state subject, it may be expected that the processes under which&#13;
states allow CWC access to their surface water data bases will develop slowly, at least for basins&#13;
where interstate conflicts exist.&#13;
36.    Improved Communication Systems. Data transfer up to the state data banks for surface&#13;
water and groundwater from the units where data is first entered into computer storage (para 21) will&#13;
normally be by dial-up NICNET connections, backed up as necessary by floppy disks (Annex 7).&#13;
CWC will use the national NICNET network for transfer of data up to its circle and regional offices,&#13;
and the unit offices of CGWB (where they exist) will transfer data to their regional offices in the same&#13;
way. Interaction between data bases should start at the data centers. Thus facilities providing for&#13;
exchange of state and CWC surface water data and of state and CGWB groundwater data are required&#13;
at these levels. A modem and a dedicated land telephone line linking the CWC regional office, CGWB&#13;
regional office and state data centers to their local NICNET ground station would provide the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
72&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 10&#13;
required level of communication. Similarly, the NICNET system would be used for communications&#13;
between CWC's central surface water data bank and its regional offices and the state SWOs, and&#13;
between the CGWB central groundwater data bank and its regional offices and the SGOs. But the&#13;
central data banks at CWC Headquarters, New Delhi, and at CGWB Headquarters, Faridabad, would&#13;
each be provided with a dedicated NICNET ground station.&#13;
37.    Improvement to Water Resources Evaluation Procedures. The establishment of interactive&#13;
data centers using advanced systems for data management will enhance the possibilities of using&#13;
digital modeling techniques for solution of a range of complex problems relating to all aspects of&#13;
water resources evaluation. In order to encourage the use of such technologies, each data center&#13;
would be provided with an appropriate package of computer software which would be useful for&#13;
solution of a range of hydrological or hydrogeological or hydrochemical problems. The training&#13;
programs to be provided to senior professionals under the project (para 27 above and Annex 11) are&#13;
framed to develop the skills necessary for use of this type of technology.&#13;
38.    Improved Systems for Data Dissemination. Collection and evaluation of data on water&#13;
resources by the concerned central and state agencies should be regarded as a service activity to&#13;
provide information to all data using government agencies and to legitimate data users from the private&#13;
sector. In this respect, water resource data collection and dissemination can be compared to many of&#13;
the activities of the IMD as a public service information agency. And the National Water Policy (para&#13;
2) states: "the prime requisite for resource planning is a well developed information system and there&#13;
should be free exchange of tdata among various agencies".&#13;
39.    As noted above, there are no clearly defined mechanisms for sharing water resource data&#13;
between states, between concernled central and state agencies, and between user agencies within&#13;
states. The creation of the proposed central and state computerized data banking systems will make&#13;
rapid exchange of data technically simple. However, the recognition that data should be easily&#13;
accessible to all legitimate users will require a change of attitude by the data collecting agencies,&#13;
particularly with regard to surface water information. And it must be recognized that publication of&#13;
year books of summarized data does not constitute full accessibility to data, though the project will&#13;
support this form of publication. Development of the concept of basic data accessibility to legitimate&#13;
users will be an important project objective.&#13;
Training to meet Institutional Objectives (Annex 10)&#13;
40.    The training component of the project is, by definition, entirely concerned with institutional&#13;
strengthening. The training programs have been devised in recognition of the existing weakness of the&#13;
present systems of data collection, verification, processing, storage and evaluation, and to provide the&#13;
skills necessary to implement the system improvements proposed under the project. Thus the training&#13;
covers: basic data collection and validation; use of computerized systems and associated software for&#13;
data storage and creation of data banks; the special requirements of creation and use of water quality&#13;
data; and the use of advanced computer technologies for all aspects of water resource evaluation and&#13;
for resource planning purposes. Much of the training in the lower echelons will be through in-house&#13;
training courses and on the job training. The training academy to be established by CWC at Pune will&#13;
receive project support (Annex 15) and, when functional, will be used for training both CWC and&#13;
SWO staff. The SGOs will make use of the training center to be established by CGWB at Raipur, the&#13;
creation of which will be supported by the project (Annex 16). And the present arrangements by&#13;
which CGWB presently provides training to SGO personnel and to its own staff in theoretical and&#13;
field hydrogeological practices are well established and effective. The proposed inputs for general&#13;
consultancy services (Annex 11) will have implicit training requirements, and part of the consultant&#13;
support will be explicitly for training. The higher level training to more senior professional staff will&#13;
be provided through NIH, through courses in Indian universities and other institutions, through study&#13;
tours in India, and through study tours or short courses abroad. Study tours within India would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
73&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Page 11&#13;
encourage improved interaction between the participating states and national agencies involved.&#13;
Overseas visits would be restricted to short study tours generally linked to international conferences.&#13;
41.     Incremental Operating Costs. Incremental staff have been defined as either: (a) new staff&#13;
recruited for project activities (i. e., expansion of the observation network, additional laboratories,&#13;
data centers, etc.); or (b) existing staff who would be trained to undertake new specialist activities, or&#13;
existing staff transferred to fill additional management posts, thus providing a vacancy at their present&#13;
post. In this respect, during the first three years of project period, the incremental staff charged under&#13;
the project would be primarily engaged in project implementation (eligible as an expenditure under the&#13;
project). The project would also support the routine recurrent (O&amp;M) costs of project related activities&#13;
(including administrative running costs of facilities, consumables and transport. In the forth year, the&#13;
incremental recurrent costs supported under the project are estimated at about 35 percent of the total&#13;
present recurrent costs of the organizational units responsible for hydrometric activities and related&#13;
water resource evaluation.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Project Coordination Aniangements&#13;
1.    Introduction. The project would be the first free-standinig hydrology project supported by&#13;
the IDA or the Bank and will be novel to many of the institutions involved. Thus, the need for&#13;
effective coordinationi between implementing agencies will be an important challenge if the project&#13;
is to achieve its predicted impact.  This Appendix describes the proposed coordination&#13;
arrangements.&#13;
2.    The Need for Effective Coordination. Although the programs to be undertaken by each&#13;
agency are individually defined, there is spatial and thematic overlap with many activities to bz&#13;
undertaken at national and state levels. Furthermore, many implementationi processes and&#13;
procedures have to be applied at the national level and yet involve all the participating agencies. In&#13;
addition, it is important that lessons learned as the project proceeds are made known as widely as&#13;
possible. Effective coordiniated planning will also be required to: (i) avoid duplication and&#13;
unnecessary expenditure: and (ii) promote quality control standards and procedures. It is also&#13;
importanit that specific coordination arrangements exist so that all project agencies obtain full&#13;
benefit from  the centrally administrative programs (i. e.. technical assistance, research and&#13;
development and some aspects of training), in a quick, consistent and efficient way.&#13;
3.    In each state, several central agencies and noi-mally two participating state agencies will be&#13;
involved in implementing the project. Similar and complementaiy programs will be undertaken by&#13;
central and state agencies in the same area. Coordinating groups need therefore to be established at&#13;
central and state levels to assist in project management. The responsibilities of the various groups&#13;
will include, inter alia: (i) monitoring and evaluating project progress and performance (para 5.19&#13;
of SAR); (ii) preparing collated institutional strengthening plans and semi-annual progress reports&#13;
for IDA review and comment (para 5.20); and (iii) collating annual work programs developed by&#13;
the participating agencies, to be submitted to IDA for its review and comment at the annulal review&#13;
of the project (para 5.21).  The proposed project coordination arrangements are presented&#13;
schematically in the attached Chart I of the SAR.&#13;
4.    National Project Coordination. A National Level Steering Committee (NLSC) has been set&#13;
up within MOWR under the Chairmanship of the Secretary of Water Resources. with&#13;
representations at Secretary level of all participating state governments and the central agencies.&#13;
The Secretary of Water Resources would be the Project Coordinator (PC). The NLSC will meet as&#13;
reqluired to resolve project policy and strategy and generic implementation issues. Under the&#13;
NLSC, a National Coordination Committee (NCC) has been set up under the MOWR. chaired by&#13;
the Member (RM) of the CWC. The NCC will deal directly with project central agencies (CWC,&#13;
CGWB. CWPRS and NIH) in matters relating to overall project coordination and will act in an&#13;
advisory c.apacitv to the project coordinating groups at state level. The India Meteorological&#13;
Department (IMD) would be represented on the NCC and participate in technical and programming&#13;
action planning. The IMD would implement its project program through its own administrative&#13;
chain of authority, but be represented on the NCC and participate in technical and project&#13;
management activities. In addition, the NCC would have a small working Project Coordination&#13;
Secretariat (PCS) within the MOWR which will be responsible for day-to-day administration and&#13;
management of project implementation. The project consultants would assist the PCS in&#13;
theimplementation and management of the project (para 3.52 of the SAR) which would answer to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
75&#13;
Annex 9&#13;
Appendix I&#13;
Page 2&#13;
the NCC and NLSC. The scope and estimated costs of the PCS are given in Table I of this Annex.&#13;
5.    The main task of the NCC would be to provide a forum to address any policy issues which&#13;
may occur during project implementation. The PCS would be directly responsible for routine&#13;
activities including: (i) project procurement and disbursement; (ii) coordination with IDA; (iii)&#13;
monitoring and evaluation of overall project performance and impact (i.e. use of the data banks);&#13;
(iv) project reporting; and (v) dissemination of agreed standards for project criteria, processes and&#13;
procedures and lessons learned as the project proceeds.&#13;
6.    The Project Coordinator (PC) would be assisted by three Deputy Project Coordinators- one&#13;
from CWC to coordinate surface water hydrological activities; one from CGWB to coordinate&#13;
groundwater hydrological activities; and one from IMD to coordinate hydrometeorological&#13;
activities. These technical DPCs would be assisted by project coordinating working groups to&#13;
manage their own specific programs, as required. These specialized working groups would&#13;
include representatives of all the participating agencies with responsibility in the technical fields&#13;
involved. The project working groups within CWC, CGWB and IMD will also be responsible for&#13;
coordinating the work programs and activities of their own programs through their regional or state&#13;
offices.&#13;
7.    Project Coordination at State Level. The project coordinating arrangements at state level&#13;
will mirror those put in place at the national level. Each state will set up a State Project&#13;
Coordinating Committees (SPCC) under a Project Coordinator/Secretary with the authority to&#13;
represent the state's interest at the national level (para 5.11 of the SAR). In states where the&#13;
surface water and groundwater hydrology entities are within the jurisdiction of a single department-&#13;
-Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Kerala, Madhya Pradesh and Tamil Nadu--the SPCCs would be&#13;
formed within the implementing department and chaired by the Secretary of the controlling&#13;
department--in most cases, the Irrigation or Water Resources Department. In states where the&#13;
surface water and groundwater hydrological agencies are controlled by separate departments--&#13;
Maharashtra, and Orissa--the State will decide the composition of the SPCC and where best to&#13;
locate the group. The SPCCs would include representatives of the implementing agencies involved&#13;
and from other interested Departments such as Finance and Planning. The SPCCs would also each&#13;
have a small secretariat (generally placed within the main implementing agency) which would be&#13;
responsible for the day-to-day overall management of the state program and would provide the&#13;
administrative linkage to the project at national level. The IMD would have a representative in each&#13;
SPCC (either from their local regional or state office). Generally the IMD program would be&#13;
implemented at national level, but would maintain strong working links to the state agencies&#13;
involved in climatic data collection.&#13;
8.    An important function of the SPCCs would be to establish a close working relationship&#13;
with the CWC and CGWB regional offices that are implementing project activities within the state&#13;
boundaries, and also with the NIH and CWPRS when their project programs occur within the state&#13;
concerned.&#13;
9.    Each state has designated its Project Coordinator and identified the other representatives on&#13;
the SPCCs. Generally, the representative of an agency is the state official responsible for&#13;
implementing the project program, or his designated representative. The SPCCs would generally&#13;
undertake the same types of tasks as for the NCC. One additional task would be to set up and&#13;
maintain the Hydrology Data User Groups to help ensure that the data service is fully used.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Training&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The primary objective of the proposed project is to improve the facilities and staff capabilities&#13;
of the central and state agencies involved in surface water and groundwater hydrology for the&#13;
collection and management of hydrometric and water quality data and the use of such data for water&#13;
resources evaluations. The human resource side of this objective would require the development of&#13;
qualified staff for all hydrological activities from field observers and data processors, through data&#13;
management experts, to specialists with wide understanding of hydrological data evaluation. The&#13;
main benefitting agencies will be the CWC, CGWB and the state surface water and groundwater&#13;
organizations, and the last two will be the recipients of the major part of the training. The NIH will&#13;
be involved in the preparation of training courses for junior staff, will provide some training&#13;
supervision for these courses, and will conduct advanced training courses for selected senior&#13;
professionals from the above central and state agencies. The CWPRS and the IMD will be sources&#13;
of specialized trainers, in particular for the use of advanced stream gauging and of meteorological&#13;
observation equipment respectively. Training consultants will be employed in support of the trainilng&#13;
activities (Annex I 1).&#13;
2.    The overall staffing structure of CWC allows for development of specialization. Thus.&#13;
junior professional staff, involved in stream gauging site supervision and hydrometric data&#13;
processing, can look forward to a career in surface water hydrology. The gauging staff are&#13;
relatively well trained and supervised. The Commission will therefore be an important source of&#13;
trainers. The project will also support the establishment of CWC's National Water Academy (NWA)&#13;
which will have a training function for the project in the longer term (Annex 15).&#13;
3'.    The CGWB is a professional organization dedicated to groundwater resource exploration,&#13;
evaluation and development monitoring. It has a long established internal arrangement for training&#13;
both its own staff and the staff of the state groundwater organizations (SGO) through induction&#13;
courses for new staff and advanced-courses for upgrading the skills of more experienced staff. The&#13;
Board is in the process of establishing a National Institute for Groundwater Research and Training&#13;
(NIGRT) at Raipur, to which the project will provide support (Annex 16). Thus, it is envisaged that&#13;
CGWB will be an important source of trainers and of training facilities under the project.&#13;
4.    Providing staff resources to support surface water hydrometry and hydrology in the state&#13;
agencies will be a major challenge. In all states, professional supervision of observation networks&#13;
and data processing are undertaken by generalist civil engineers with little or no background in the&#13;
technology of hydrometry. Similarly, hydrological evaluations often are made by generalists.&#13;
Moreover, the career structures are such that employment in hydrological units are temporary and&#13;
there is no reward for specialization. With this situation, the stream gauging teams often are poorly&#13;
supervised and inadequately trained. And the low status afforded to hydrology results in&#13;
unpredictable and insufficient funding for what should be a routine task. In addition to provision of&#13;
training in surface water hydrology, the project would address other institutional strengthening&#13;
arrangements to improve the organizations (Annex 9).&#13;
5.    The SGOs of the participating states are generally well organized. They have been able to&#13;
build up experience in the various tasks to be undertaken, because they employ specialist staff -&#13;
hydrogeologists, geophysicists, chemists, etc. - with defined career paths within their&#13;
organizations. Nevertheless, all SGOs would benefit from additional training, particularly in the&#13;
new technologies to be introduced for network monitoring systems and for data managemenlt.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
79&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 2&#13;
6.    Senior specialist staff of all agencies require training, particularly in advanced techniques&#13;
relating to data management, hydrological, hydrogeological and hydrochemical evaluations, and&#13;
chemical and biological proceduLres for pollution identification for public health and environmental&#13;
protection reasonis.&#13;
Traiinig Objectives&#13;
7.    The project would introduce standard procedures for data collection, processing, validation&#13;
and managemenit, incluiding the use of software for routine quality control and general water&#13;
resource analysis. Thus, a basic training objective would be to ensure that these procedures are&#13;
followed consistently throughout the project area. The training component would also establish&#13;
regular internal training progr-ams within the agencies so that the staff developmentcapabilities&#13;
developed tinder the project can be maintained without further external support.&#13;
Development of the Training Programs&#13;
X.    The training programs will be initiated as soon as the project starts, using training&#13;
conisultants (Annex I 1) and qualified staff of CWC, CGWB and specialists from NIH, CWPRS&#13;
and [MD as trainers. The cuniculae for the courses will be developed by the appropriate agencies&#13;
with the assistance of the consultants. Training of trainers from state agencies will be an early&#13;
activity. The training couL-ses for technical staff and junior supervisory staff will be conducted&#13;
mainly at the state Water andi Land Management Institutes (WALMI), where suitable facilities are&#13;
available. More advanced courses and workshops for higher level staff will take place at NIH in&#13;
Roorkee and with IMD in P[ine. The CWC's NWA and the CGWB's NIGRT (paras 2 and 3) will&#13;
provide facilities anid staff to support part of the project's training requirements, once these&#13;
institutions are established. Selected senior staff will undertake post-graduate courses in Indian&#13;
universities and institutions. Provision is also made for through study tours in India and abroad.&#13;
Hvdrometeorologv&#13;
9 .   Basic Course for [ lvdrormeteorological Observers. A four week course will be provided for&#13;
the field observers at all sites. These staff are of sub-professional grade, normally having only a&#13;
matiiculation qualificationi. This course would be undertaken at the IMD training center available at&#13;
Calcutta, Pune and Madras. Training would be conducted in both English and Hindi by IMD staff.&#13;
Some 3,000 staff ftrom eight participating states would require training during the project.&#13;
1 0.  Training foil Hvdr ometeorological Supervisors. A six week course would be provided for&#13;
staff of Junior Engineer or Assistant Engineer grade. The course would cover all aspects of&#13;
operation of a full climate station (FCS). The course would also train supervisory staff to monitor&#13;
the quality of data collected from field sites. The training would be conducted by IMD staff at their&#13;
central training facility at Pune. Some 400 staff would require such training over the project period.&#13;
11.  Advanced Level/Refresher Courses for Senior  Staff. A four week course for staff of&#13;
Executive Engineer to Superintending Engineer levels will be held at the central IMD training facility&#13;
at Pune. The course would train these staff on advanced aspects of hydrometeorology. The&#13;
objective would be to train the staff in the use of hydrometeorological data in dam design, for flood&#13;
warning and for management of water resource projects. Some 75 staff would receive this training&#13;
during the project period.&#13;
Surface Water Hvdrologv&#13;
12.   Basic Field Hydrometry. A two week course would be conducted for field observation staff&#13;
of CWC and state hydrology departments either at the new CWC Training Academy or at the&#13;
existing CTU in Pune in the case of CWC staff, or in an appropriate state training establishment for&#13;
stjff of state agencies. In some cases WALMI facilities may be used. Trainers would be dr'i '&#13;

from the training consultants and CWC initially, but in time trained staff of the state hydi-ology&#13;
departments would take over (para 14). The staff attending the courses would be a mixture of sub-&#13;
professionals (overseers) and Junior Engineers. All aspects of river flow gauging would be taught,&#13;
and some practical gauging demonstrations would be given. The trainees would be given a general&#13;
description of the role that hydrological data plays in water resources development and management.&#13;
Some 4,000 staff would be trained during the course of the project to allow ftor natural wastage.&#13;
13.  Hydrological Data Collection for Junior Managers. A four week cOurse would be provided&#13;
for Assistant Engineers who have responsibility for supervision of river tlow, water quality and&#13;
sediment monitoring stations. Staff would normally have undertaken the basic field hydrometry&#13;
course or would have had several years of practical field gauging experience. The course would be&#13;
held either at the new CWC Training Academy or at the existing CTIJ in Pune in the case of CWC&#13;
staff, or in an appropriate state training establishment for staff of state agencies, such as a WALMI.&#13;
Trainers would be drawn from the training consultants and CWC initially but in time, staff of the&#13;
state hydrology departments, trained as described in para 14, would take over. The training would&#13;
provide a refresher course on field practices and would also cover all aspects of office procedures&#13;
necessary to ensure data are properly validated before being computerized. The cour-se would also&#13;
provide limited instruction on hydrological and water resources evaluations so that trainees can&#13;
appreciate the importance of good quality data. Some 1.000 staff would require this level of&#13;
training during the project.&#13;
14.  Training Hydrometric Trainers. A ten week course would be provided for ftoul to six&#13;
experienced staff from each state hydrological agency and for a limited number of statf from CWC&#13;
on all aspects of hydrological data collection. The objective would be to traini these staff as trainels&#13;
for courses described in paras 12 and 13 above. The courses would be held at the CWC Traininig&#13;
Academy or at the existing CTU at Pune or at NIH. The courses would include practical training at&#13;
several CWC river gauging stations. The training would be provided bv experienced CWC staff&#13;
supported by local and foreign training consultants. Some 70 staff would require this type of&#13;
training. Those trained would provide the main pool of trainers for the hydrological observers.&#13;
15.  Basic Computer and Data Entrv Training. A six week course would be held at an appropriate&#13;
state training establishment for staff of state agencies. For staff of CWC. the course would be held&#13;
at the CWC Training Academy, or at the existing CTU at Pune. The course would provide a basic&#13;
introduction to personal computers (PC) for junior professional staff and lor sub-professional staff.&#13;
These staff will have the role of entering the manuscript data received ftroin the field into the&#13;
computerized databases. The course would be split into two equal parts. The first will provide the&#13;
trainees with an introduction to PC computers, to the use of DOS, Windows and a range of general&#13;
utility programs, such as word processors and spreadsheets. The second will provide detailed&#13;
training on use of the surface water and water quality database software. The project will train some&#13;
300 staff in the above skills.&#13;
16.  Advanced Computer Course for Database Suprvisors. This six week course will be held at&#13;
an appropriate state training establishment, or at the new CWC Training Academy or the existing&#13;
CTU in Pune, or at NIH. The course would be for staff of Executive Engineer level and would be&#13;
conducted by a combination of staff from the Training Consultants and NIH. The majority of&#13;
trainees would have had little or no exposure to computers and hence the first two weeks of the&#13;
course would provide the same sort of basic introduction to PCs, operating systems and associated&#13;
software that is described under para 15. The course would also provide a more detailed description&#13;
of the specialised surface water and water quality database and analysis softwares. I'he course will&#13;
emphasize data processing and quality control, and would aim to provide these supervisory staff&#13;
with the skills necessary to monitor the flow of data from field stations into the database. About&#13;
200 staff would require this type of training.&#13;
17.  Advanced Course for Database Managers. An eight week course will be held at NIH for&#13;
selected staff from each organisation designated as database managers for their data centers. There&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
81&#13;
Annex 10&#13;
Page 4&#13;
will be 11 surface water data centers: CWC at New Delhi and its two regional offices, and one in&#13;
each of the eight participating states. There should be two database managers from each data center,&#13;
but others would require training during the project to cover natural wastage. The trainees should&#13;
have some basic knowledge of computers, or should have attended the course described in para 15&#13;
above. The trainees will require a very thorough understanding of the database software in order to&#13;
be able to maintain its integrity and security. They will have responsibility for ensuring that regular&#13;
backups of the system are taken. They will also have responsibility for maintaining the integrity of&#13;
the subsidiary databases under their agency's jurisdiction at circle, division and sub-division levels.&#13;
The database managers will be assisted by the computer support staff to be provided as part of the&#13;
computer maintenance agreements for each agency.&#13;
18.  Specialised Training on Use of Innovative Equipment. A limited amount of innovative&#13;
equipment is to be provided under the project and staff will have to be trained in its use. There are&#13;
three types of such equipment proposed under the project; pressure transducer WLR with digital&#13;
loggers, acoustic doppler current profilers (ADCP), and the reservoir survey packages. Selected&#13;
staff from each agency will receive specialised training as appropriate on these equipments. The&#13;
primnary training will be provided by the equipment suppliers supported by staff of the training&#13;
consultants and CWPRS.&#13;
19.  Study Tours within India. There would be considerable merit in staff visiting other parts of&#13;
India to learn how hydrological data collection is carried out under a variety of river regimes. These&#13;
tours will also enable hydrometric and data processing staff exchange experiences on the new skills&#13;
and techniques introduced under the project. These study tours would have a duration of about two&#13;
weeks.&#13;
20.  Postgraduate Training in India. Good postgraduate hydrology and water resources courses&#13;
are run in India at the University of Roorkee and at Anna University in Madras. The project would&#13;
fund students from participating agencies who attend such courses through sponsorship. Staff sent&#13;
on a course should have worked within the field of hydrology for at least one year prior to being&#13;
sponsored. They should undertake to remain with their hydrology unit for at least three years after&#13;
the course.&#13;
21.  Overseas Study Tours/Training. A limited number of overseas study tours are proposed for&#13;
middle level and senior staff. The tours would be of two weeks duration. They might follow&#13;
suitable overseas conferences or symposia. The aim would be to expose more senior staff to&#13;
hydrological practices in other countries. Staff sent on study tours should have worked in&#13;
hydrology for at least five years prior to being sponsored, and they should undertake to remain&#13;
within their hydrology unit for at least three years after the tour.&#13;
Groundwater Hydrology&#13;
22.  Basic Field Hydrometry for Observers. A two week course would be provided in an&#13;
appropriate state training establishment (e.g. a WALMI) for field monitoring staff of state&#13;
groundwater agencies. The training would cover, manual measurement of water levels, water&#13;
quality sampling, use of field measuring equipment,(biaxial tapes, EC meters, pH meters, etc.),&#13;
operation and maintenance of portable compressors and submersible electric pump units for water&#13;
sampling from tubewells, and servicing of digital water level recorders. Trainers would be drawn&#13;
from the training consultants and CGWB initially, but staff of the state groundwater departments&#13;
trained as described in para 23 would later take over.&#13;
23.  Training of Trainers for Groundwater Hydrometry. Four to six staff would be selected from&#13;
each state groundwater agency to take a 10 week training course with CGWB, Faridabad. They&#13;
would be trained as trainers for all aspects of groundwater hydrometry as outlined under para 22&#13;
above. The training would be undertaken in the first year of the project. About 60 persons would&#13;
be trained as trainers, allowing for wastage.&#13;

location in a state or at the CGWB Training Institute to be established in Raipur. The course would&#13;
provide an introduction to PCs for junior professional staff and for sub-professional staff. These&#13;
staff will be responsible for entering the manuscript data received from the field into the&#13;
computerized databases. The course would be split into two parts. The first will provide trainees&#13;
with an introduction to PCs, to the use of DOS, Windows and to a range of general utility&#13;
programs, such as word processors and spreadsheets. The second half of the course will provide&#13;
detailed training on use of groundwater and water quality database software. The course would&#13;
bring trainees up to the standard necessary for everyday operation of the software. The project will&#13;
train some 300 staff.&#13;
25.  Advanced Computer Course for Database Supervisors. A six week course will be held at an&#13;
appropriate state location or at the CGWB Training Institute. The course would be for middle level&#13;
professional staff and would be conducted by staff from the Training Consultants, NIH and&#13;
CGWB. The majority of trainees would have had little exposure to computers and hence the first&#13;
two weeks of the course would provide the same sort of basic introduction to PC computers,&#13;
operating systems and to associated software as that described under para 24 above. The course&#13;
would also provide a more detailed insight of the specialised groundwater and water quality&#13;
database and analysis software. The course would concentrate on data processing and quality&#13;
control and would aim to provide these supervisory staff with the skills necessary to monitor the&#13;
flow of data from field stations into the database. About 200 staff would require this type of&#13;
training.&#13;
26.  Advanced Course for Database Managers. An eight week intensive course would be held for&#13;
selected staff from each groundwater organisation designated as database managers for their data&#13;
center. There will be 22 groundwater data centers: CGWB at Faridabad and its 13 Regional&#13;
Offices, and one in each of the eight participating states. There should be two such database&#13;
managers from each data center, but others would require training during the project due to wastage.&#13;
The trainees should have some basic knowledge of computers, or should have attended course&#13;
described in para 24 above. The trainees will require a very thorough understanding of the database&#13;
software in order to be able to maintain its integrity and security. They will have responsibility for&#13;
ensuring that regular backups of the system are taken. They will also have responsibility for&#13;
maintaining the integrity of the subsidiary databases under their agencies' jurisdiction at circle and&#13;
division levels. The database managers will be assisted by the specialised computer support staff to&#13;
be provided as part of the computer maintenance agreements for each agency.&#13;
27.  Specialised Training in Modelling. Selected staff from the groundwater agencies will be&#13;
provided with training in digital modelling of aquifer systems. The training will take about 12&#13;
weeks and will be provided at NIH, Roorkee or a similar institution. The trainees would select&#13;
aquifer systems with adequate data from their states for modelling.&#13;
28.  Study tours within India. There would be advantage in staff visiting other parts of India to&#13;
learn how hydrological data collection is carried out under a variety of aquifer system regimes.&#13;
These tours will also enable hydrometric and data processing staff exchange experiences on the&#13;
techniques introduced under the project. These study tours would have a duration of two weeks.&#13;
29.  PostgraduateTraining in India. Two postgraduate geo-hydrology courses are run in India at&#13;
the University of Roorkee and at Anna University in Madras. The project would fund students&#13;
from participating agencies who attend such courses through sponsorship. Staff sent on a course&#13;
should have worked in the field of hydrogeology for at least a year prior to being sponsored, and&#13;
they should undertake to remain with their unit for at least three years after the course.&#13;
30.  Overseas Study Tours. A limited number of overseas study tours are proposed under the&#13;
project, mainly for middle level and senior staff of the groundwater agencies. The tours would be&#13;
&#13;

job training in laboratory management and by training with innovative equipment in overseas&#13;
laboratories. The training would include the use of all the specialized laboratory equipment to be&#13;
provided under the project for standard chemical analyses and for analyses of heavy metals and&#13;
micro-pollutants, and the use of computer software for analyses and storage of water quality data.&#13;
The training would also include interpretation of data on general chemical quality, resource&#13;
assessment and identification of problem areas. The training would be provided by a combination of&#13;
suitably experienced local staff supported by foreign training consultants. Some 45 staff would&#13;
require this type of training during the project.&#13;
34.  Basic Compuer Training and Data Entry. All staff of the three categories above (para 31-33)&#13;
should be provided with a six week basic computer training similar to that described under para 15,&#13;
preferably prior to undertaking the specified courses.&#13;
35.  Study Tours witinIndia. Staff would acquire knowledge by learning how other staff of the&#13;
same level are carrying out their jobs. Study tours would facilitate the exchange of ideas,&#13;
experiences and techniques. They would provide motivation for the staff. The study tours would&#13;
have a duration of about two weeks.&#13;
36.  Postgraduate_Training in India. The project would fund suitably qualified students from&#13;
participating agencies to attend water quality chemistry courses through sponsorship. Staff sent on&#13;
such a course should have worked on water quality chemistry for at least a year prior to being&#13;

37.  Overseas Study Tours. A limited number of overseas study tours are proposed mainly for&#13;
middle level and senior staff. Such tours would typically be of two weeks duration. They might&#13;
follow suitable overseas conferences or symposia. The aim of these tours would be to expose senior&#13;
staff to water quality issues in other countries. Staff sent on study tours should generally have&#13;
worked in the field of water quality chemistry for at least ten years prior to being sponsored, and&#13;
they should undertake to remain within their agency for at least three years after the tour.&#13;
38.  Lump Sum for Specialized Training Overseas. For a limited number of staff, mainly at the&#13;
level of Chief Chemist, some specialized overseas training may be needed to expose them to&#13;
intemational standards in their fields of expertise. A provision under a lump sum allocation is made&#13;
for such courses which could include, inter-alia:&#13;
(a) laboratory management;&#13;
(b) data quality assurance program;&#13;

Planning and Supervision of Training Arrangements&#13;
39.   Responsibility for planning of the project's training program would be undertaken by a&#13;
National Hydrology Training Committee (NHTC) with members and representatives from the&#13;
participating national and state organizations. The training consultants would function as advisers to&#13;
the NHTC. Proposals for training courses, workshops and seminars would be reviewed and&#13;
approved by the Committee. The objective of this process in respect of training courses would be to&#13;
ensure standardization of training materials and methodologies, appropriate time schedules,&#13;
selection of appropriate trainers, and selection of appropriate participants. The Committee would&#13;
further review and advise on the curriculae of the University of Roorkee, Anna Technical University&#13;
and other institutions where training is to be funded under the project.,&#13;
40.   Primary functions of the training consultants in assisting the NHTC would be preparation of&#13;
material for the training courses and assessing the effectiveness and impact of the training. Thus,&#13;
project training would be routinely monitored and evaluated to ensure consistency of quality and that&#13;
lessons learned are shared among the involved organizations and individuals. This monitoring&#13;
would be achieved in part through training seminars and in part by a formal reporting system by&#13;
concemed trainers after each course. The reports would provide information on course aims and&#13;
impacts, and recommendations for improving similar future courses.&#13;

Annex I I&#13;

INDIA&#13;
HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Consultant Services&#13;
Summary&#13;
1.  Consultants would be employed through the MOWR (see para 12) to assist and advise the&#13;
project implementation agencies at national, regional and state level. To maintain the project&#13;
implementation schedule, Government would agree to employ consultant services by March 31,&#13;
1996. The services would be as summarized below and as detailed in Part A and B of this Annex.&#13;
The activities of General Project Support and Assistance in Training Activities are described&#13;
separately, although it is anticipated that all consultancy work would be undertaken by a single&#13;
group or association of firms.&#13;
2.  General Project Assistance. Consultants would be employed to assist MOWR, IMD  and the&#13;
participating state agencies under draft terms of reference given in Part A of this Annex. The&#13;
consultant services would be some 316 foreign and 1,170 local staff months over about 65&#13;
months.&#13;
3.  Assistance in Training Activities. Consultanis would be employed to assist MOWR, IMD and&#13;
the participating state agencies in setting up and implementing the training activities under draft&#13;
terms of reference given in Part B of this Annex. The consultant services would be about 105&#13;
foreign and 342 local staff months over a period of about 51 months.&#13;
4.  General Provisions. For both consultancies the firm, or firms, would provide for positioning&#13;
and per diem costs of all staff and for administration overheads, including, inter alia, resources for&#13;
duty visits to the states, printing, postage, communications, equipment rental, office materials and&#13;
general consumables. The firmns would also provide: office space in New Delhi and elsewhere, as&#13;
required; for their own transportation, either through purchase of vehicles, or an equivalent per&#13;
diem transportation allowance, and such office equipment, including computers, that the&#13;
consultants reasonably require to undertake their duties. Both consultancies would be in place on or&#13;
about September 30, 1995, and would be employed according to the "Guidelines for the Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the World Bank as the Executing Agency".. The terms&#13;
of reference and other documentation for both consultancies would include sufficient information&#13;
on the project objectives, scope, procedures and criteria to enable short-listed firms to prepare&#13;
responsive bids.&#13;
5.  The Consultant Joint Venture. The preferred arrangement would be a joint venture consultant&#13;
group of international and national firms in which both firms have, inter alia: (a) experience in all&#13;
aspects of surface water and groundwater hydrology, surface water and groundwater quality, and&#13;
related hydrometeorological activities; and (b) experience of Indian institutions involved in surface&#13;
water and groundwater resource monitoring and evaluation. Both foreign and national consultant&#13;
firms would show evidence that they can mobilize sufficient experienced staff so that an alternate&#13;
(with equivalent experience) could substitute for, or be rotated with the nominee for each position&#13;
to ensure continuity in experience.&#13;
6.  There is strong evidence that none of the established national consultant firms in the water&#13;
resources sector employ sufficient specialized staff in all aspects of hydrology as full time&#13;
employees. National firms would therefore have to recruit individual consultants specifically for the&#13;
proposed consultancy. In this respect, most of the individual national consultants available are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
87&#13;
Annex 11&#13;
Page 2&#13;
likely to be retired senior technocrats with little recent experience in operational hydrology. It may&#13;
therefore be beneficial to employ the national consultants on an individual basis.  Should this&#13;
approach be necessary, it is recommended that: (a) the foreign consultants be employed (according&#13;
to ODA's guidelines for the employment of consultants if financed from British technical assistance&#13;
sources); and (b) once the foreign consultants are in position in India, they would recruit the&#13;
national team, either through direct negotiations with one or more national consultant firms, or on&#13;
an individual basis.&#13;
7.  Another option, to be evaluated by the project authorities, for routine field tasks to be&#13;
undertaken or supervised by the consultants, would be to staff the consultancy through secondment&#13;
of experienced mid-career professional officers from the agencies participating in the project. One&#13;
or two staff with operational experience in hydrology could be selected from each of the&#13;
participating states and seconded for about a two year period to work directly under the foreign&#13;
consultants at national and state levels. The seconded staff would generally be senior Assistant&#13;
Engineer (AE) or equivalent grade, preferably within about three years of seniority for promotion to&#13;
Executive Engineer (EE) grade. The seconded officer would be given suitable incentives to take up&#13;
the position with the consultant team including, inter alia, adequate allowances for housing,&#13;
subsistence, dearness and travel, and possibly one grade increment while on deputation. After a&#13;
period of about six months working with the project agencies and consultant team at national levels,&#13;
the seconded staff (who prove to be suitable) would be posted to a state (other than their own state)&#13;
to assist the consultants' work program. The advantage of this option is that it would solve the&#13;
problem of recruiting national consultants with operational experience and willing to undertake field&#13;
work. It would also provide an excellent opportunity for on-the-job training to some of the best&#13;
staff from the agencies participating in the project.&#13;
8.  Consultant firms competing for consultancies under Parts A and B of this Annex would&#13;
produce evidence of their ability to prepare technical and progress reports, and planning and&#13;
implementation documentation for projects dealing with all aspects of hydrology. They would thus&#13;
demonstrate, inter alia, their ability to evaluate and produce reports related to: (a) the specific&#13;
project objectives; (b) project implementation performance and analysis; (c) preparation of action&#13;
plans and cost estimates; (d) collection and evaluation of surface water, groundwater and other&#13;
relevant physical resources data; (e) surface water and groundwater chemistry and pollution; and (f)&#13;
institutional strengthening including administrative, financial and human resource management.&#13;
Additionally, firms competing for consultancies under Part B of this Annex would produce&#13;
evidence of their relevant training experience. Credit would be given in the evaluation process to&#13;
consultant groups with relevant experience in: (a) projects which involved coordination between the&#13;
types of agencies involved in the proposed project; and (b) similar project activities in India and/or&#13;
South Asia.&#13;
Part A. General Project Assistance&#13;
General&#13;
9.  The composite team of international and local consultants for Part A would be commissioned&#13;
by GOI and employed over a period of about 65 months, starting on or about October 1, 1995. The&#13;
consultancy would entail some 316 foreign and 1,166 local staff months. The international&#13;
consultant services would consist of long-term technical and managerial assistance with staff&#13;
resident in India, supplemented by short-term consultants for specialized technical services, as&#13;
required to effectively implement the project activities. The national consultancy input would also&#13;
include long-term and short-term specialist services. In addition, the consultants would be required&#13;
to provide the necessary experienced sub-professional staff to assist in carrying out the services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Annex 11&#13;
Page 3&#13;
Quantities, cost estimates and tentative staffing schedules for the consultant services are given in&#13;
Table IA of this Annex.&#13;
10. The main objective of the consultancy services under Part A would be to provide broad&#13;
technical and institutional support to the participating agencies and to assist the project authorities to&#13;
implement the project in accordance with technical criteria, standards, and procedures agreed by the&#13;
Bank and the Government. The services would be intensive over the first four years of the project&#13;
period and would gradually diminish thereafter. The main challenge of the consultancy would be to&#13;
provide adequate resources to assist government during the project start-up period to introduce&#13;
standard processes and procedures for each project activity. During this period, the consultants&#13;
would give special assistance to the design of supervision and monitoring procedures to: enable&#13;
effective management of the project; ensure quality control; and assess project impact.&#13;
I 1. Additional important tasks of the consultants would be to:&#13;
(a)     assist the project agencies with the general management of the project, including&#13;

Organization of the Consultants&#13;
12. The consultancy services would be set up to reflect that the project covers eight states in India&#13;
(six of which have separate surface water and groundwater hydrology agencies), and five national&#13;
agencies - CWC, CGWB, NIH, CWPRS and IMD. Thus the consultants will have to advise and&#13;
assist some 19 separate entities. Given the geographical and institutional spread of the project, it is&#13;
recommended that the consultancy organization includes a Central Coordinating Team (CCT),&#13;
consisting of four foreign consultants and up to seven local consultants based in New Delhi. The&#13;
CCT would work on a daya-to -day basis with the NHP Coordination Secretariat (Attachment 1,&#13;
Annex 9). The team leader and his associates would collectively have broad experience in surface&#13;
water and groundwater hydrometry and hydrology, water quality and information management&#13;
Members of the team would be required to visit the participating states on a regular basis. The local&#13;
consultants would be designated to particular states and/or central organizations, for regular liaison,&#13;
coordination, and progress monitoring.&#13;

NATIONAL HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Project Supervision and Monitorable Indicators of Development Impact&#13;
I.    This annex describes the project's proposed supervision arrangements (Part A below) and&#13;
then discusses and presents indicators of Development Impact (Part B). For the latter, a matrix&#13;
table showing the indicators and assessment methodology for monitoring the project's progress&#13;
and development impact is attached.&#13;
A. SUPERVISION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
2.    The supervision arrangements for the proposed project would be complex for both&#13;
Government and the Bank because of the geographical spread, the number of schemes and&#13;
components, the range of challenges being addressed, and the need to provide project&#13;
implementation and performance data essential to the supervision process. In this respect, an&#13;
important function of the consultant services, described in Annex 10, would be to guide and&#13;
assist Government in project supervision and to strengthen the capabilities of the agencies&#13;
involved to monitor and evaluate project implementation. However, even with the consultancy&#13;
input, the project would require above average Bank supervision resources. The recommended&#13;
supervision requirements are presented in para 5 below.&#13;
3.    Project supervision will be closely integrated with the project's reporting arrangements&#13;
and annual review process, as described in chapter V of the main text. The project's review&#13;
and monitoring tools (main report para 5.04) include:&#13;
(i) annual Hydrology Institutional Development Reviews (HIDRs);&#13;
(ii) annual Hydrology Development Workshops (HDWs);&#13;
(iii) the Annual Project Reviews (APRs);&#13;
(iv) feedback from Hydrology Data User Groups (HDUGs);&#13;
(v) meetings and minutes/correspondence of the National Coordination Committee&#13;
(NCC);&#13;
(vi) meetings and minutes/correspondence of the State Project Coordination&#13;
Committees (SPCCs);&#13;
(vii) the reports of the Hydrology Project consultants; and&#13;
(viii) Semi-annual reports of the SPCCs and NPC.&#13;
These reports would form a strong internal management and review structure as part of the&#13;
project.  Supervision objectives would be to foster development of this structure and&#13;
management process. Successful development of the project management and monitoring&#13;
system outlined in chapter 5 would not only be an important factor in the project's success and&#13;
sustainability, but would also reduce the Bank's supervision requirements.&#13;

4.    The supervision arrangements (after the first supervision or "Project Launch" mission -&#13;
main text para 5.23) would be for the Bank to supervise the project through the resident&#13;
mission staff with two missions each year. The main mission would be November/December&#13;
each year and constitute the annual implementation review. It would use results from the&#13;
HIDRs and the draft APRs as background material. During this mission, appropriate action&#13;
would be taken to review and amend the annual work program for the following fiscal year (to&#13;
match the budgetary process). The second mission would take place in about May/June each&#13;
year. An important task would be to review the budgetary allocations and work program&#13;
agreed during the main mission. Between the two supervision missions, the day-to-day&#13;
supervision would be undertaken by NDO staff. The Project Launch mission (Sept/Oct 1995)&#13;
would require extra staff resources to cover the start-up of the project. In later project years,&#13;
inputs lower than 18 staff weeks may be feasible (para 3).&#13;

B. MONITORABLE INDICATORS OF DEVELOPMENT IMPACT&#13;
6 .    The monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) process and procedures under HP have an&#13;
important implementation role, since this is the first free-standing Bank/IDA operation of its type in&#13;
India and elsewhere. It is important that any lessons to be learned as implementation proceeds be&#13;
used to improve the project design on a continuous process. To enable this process to take place,&#13;
HP has been formulated as a flexible operation with in-built capability for continuous monitoring,&#13;
annual reviews and appropriate adjustments. The procedures are illustrated diagrammatically in the&#13;
Implementation Schedule at Page 7 of this report and in figure I of Annex 9 of this report.&#13;
7.    The design of the monitoting indicators for the project must take into account that HP is a&#13;
Iservice' operation. The project concept is to assist the Central Govemment and the participating&#13;
State water resource agencies in the development of valid, comprehensive, interactive, easily&#13;
accessed, and user friendly data bases covering all important aspects of the hydrological cycle. A&#13;
specific design aim is to provide data bases to all legitimate entities involved in management and&#13;
development of water resources, and the range of information stored and its formatting and&#13;
accessibility will be designed to meet the requirements of such users. The responsibility for&#13;
development and archiving of the data bases would reside with organizations which are, to the&#13;
extent practically possible. institutionally separated froim user agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
100&#13;
Annex 12&#13;
Page 3&#13;
8.    Since HP provides only a 'service' to user organizations, the project will not have a direct&#13;
development impact (see Chapter 6 of the main text) . Instead, all the benefits will be indirect,&#13;
resulting from savings in capital and recurrent costs through improved planning and design, and&#13;
through more effective management of water resource investments. This indirect project impact&#13;
will be assessed as the project proceeds, through the project's reporting mechanism and by&#13;
obtaining feedback from the Hydrology Data User Groups (organizations in the public and private&#13;
sectors) to be set up and maintained under the project (Appendix 1, Annex 7).&#13;
9.    The main monitorable objectives of the project would be to improve the organizational&#13;
arrangements, technical capabilities and physical facilities available for measurement, validation,&#13;
collation, analysis, transfer and dissemination of hydrological, hydrometeorological and water&#13;
quality data, and for basic water resource evaluations within the concerned agencies at Central&#13;
Government level and in the seven participating states. All these activities will be monitored as the&#13;
project is implemented and will be continuously evaluated to establish that the data collected meets&#13;
the needs of the users concerned, both in terms of adequacy and quality (see Tables attached). The&#13;
methodology for assessment will be the annual reporting requirements under the project and the&#13;
annual review process.&#13;
10.   The monitoring of 'development objectives' of HP will depend on monitoring each of the&#13;
interdependent elements involved in the 'hydrological and hydrometeorological data service' to be&#13;
provided (i. e., the elements related to data collection, verification, collation and dissemination),&#13;
since each element has to function effectively if the sole project output - a data service - is to&#13;
function properly. Since all project activities directly or indirectly involve strengthening of&#13;
institutions, special attention has been given to the monitoring of the institutional strengthening&#13;
activities. The project's annual Hydrology Institutional Development Reviews (HIDRs), done by&#13;
each agency, the annual Hydrology Development Workshops (HDWs), also conducted by each&#13;
agency, as well as feedback from the Hydrology Data User Groups (HDUGs) will be the principal&#13;
monitoring tools used to assess institutional strengthening.&#13;

HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Aspects&#13;
1.    Introduction. This annex summarizes the findings and recommendations of the appraisal&#13;
environmental review of the above mentioned Project. Since the project has been assessed as&#13;
having minimal environmental impact potential, no detailed environmental assessment report has&#13;
been prepared. Thus, the Bank's classification of the project as a Type C project is valid and&#13;
justifiable. The project poses minimal environmental risks and considerable indirect benefits.&#13;
A. General Environmental Issues&#13;
2.    There no major environmental issues since the project is a service operation and involved&#13;
only minor works. Thus, the negative environmental impacts of the project would be minimal,&#13;
infrequent and temporary as the physical infrastructure is individually small and scattered, and does&#13;
not cause any permanent disturbance. The occasional construction of water gauging stations,&#13;
meteorological data collection sites, or small buildings would constitute the maximum type of&#13;
disturbance on the environment envisaged under the proposed project. In most locations, there&#13;
would be some flexibility in the siting of physical infrastructure to accommodate local needs.&#13;
3.    The project will generate substantial indirect beneficial effects by providing a reliable and&#13;
accessible scientific data for future planning and management of surface and groundwater&#13;
resources; these benefits will far outweigh small and temporary disturbances.&#13;
4.    A reliable data base will improve the efficiency of water resources development and&#13;
management. In this respect, poorly designed projects which are not able to function as designed&#13;
because of inadequate or unpredictable water resources almost always result in a consequential&#13;
negative environmental impact.&#13;
5.    Of special importance, the proposed strengthening of the water quality data base would&#13;
provide substantial environmental and social benefits to a large array of development and&#13;
preservation/conservation issues which at present cannot be effectively evaluated or managed&#13;
because of the lack of reliable data. An important objective of the project is to improve the&#13;
coordination between the users of water quality data, in particular, coordination between the data&#13;
collection agencies and the pollution control boards at national and state levels. This will be&#13;
achieved by greatly improved dissemination of data and much easier access to the data bases.&#13;
6.    Conclusion. There are no pending environmental issues related to the project. All the&#13;
major issues are indirect and primarily relate to inappropriate development or management of water&#13;
resources and consequential misuse of the development. It is concluded that a fundamental&#13;
premise to protect the environment in any water resources development is to base the planning and&#13;
design on a sound scientific and sufficient data base.&#13;

HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Procurement&#13;
1.  General. The procurement under the project would be undertaken by the implementing agencies&#13;
at national and provincial levels, as appropriate. To expedite procurement and promote the&#13;
standardization of criteria, processes and procedures where possible, Govemment would cause the&#13;
CWC, CGWB and IMD to set up Project Procurement Committees (PPCs) satisfactory to IDA. The&#13;
three PPGs would generally be headed by the agency Project coordinator who will represent the&#13;
agency on the Central Project Coordinating Group.&#13;
2.  The GOI would maintain the PPCs with terms of reference and membership agreed with IDA.&#13;
The PPCs would include representatives of the state agencies responsible for implementing work&#13;
programs as follows; surface water hydrology under CWC; groundwater hydrology programs under&#13;
CGWB; and hydrometeorological programs under IMD. The first task of the PPCs would be to&#13;
finalize the procurement implementation plans at national and state levels by implementing agency.&#13;
Each plan would summarize the project elements, their estimated costs, the proposed methods of&#13;
procurement, and procurement accounts by years. In this process, the main task would be to then&#13;
prepare general specifications, where appropriate, to be used in the standardized procurement&#13;
documentation and agree how the various goods would be packaged. In addition, the PPCs would&#13;
provide an advisory service to support agencies undertaken procurement at state levels. An important&#13;
initial action would be to ensure that each agency under the project understands the Bank's&#13;
procurement procedures and the process when the Bank requires prior review or any other clearance&#13;
procedure. In this respect, as soon as the PPCs are set up within CWC, CGWB and IMD, it is&#13;
recommended that short seminars are held in New Delhi to discuss the procurement process and&#13;
answer any queries that may arise.&#13;
3.  IDA Procurement Review Process. The procurement documentation would be reviewed and&#13;
approved by staff from the Procurement Unit, Resident Mission of India (New Delhi). The project&#13;
Task Manager designated by IDA (based in New Delhi) would be responsible for supervise the&#13;
procurement process. Project procurement would be based on Bank model procurement&#13;
documentation (already agreed by GOI and the World Bank and most of the participating states for&#13;
other Bank supported operations). The specifications for works and goods need to be formulated and&#13;
standardized by the national lead agencies (i.e., CWC, CGWB and IMD). Where possible,&#13;
instruments and equipment would be procured to ISI specifications. The procurement documentation&#13;
for the first two years of project implementation would be approved by the Bank prior to negotiations.&#13;
The proposed methods of procurement are summarized below.&#13;
4.  Lanld. Under the project, all land required for works is already owned by the national agencies&#13;
concerned or the Govemments of the states participating in the project, with the exception of land for&#13;
observation sites which have still to be located. All land costs of land still to be obtained would be&#13;
financed by the Governments concerned.&#13;
Civil Woks&#13;
5.  The project supports civil works estimated at some US$ 42.8 million. Civil works comprise of:&#13;
construction of surface water observation stations and climate observation sites; observation&#13;
tubewells; and a limited number of new buildings. The works are widely dispersed at many locations&#13;
in the participating states. and would not attract foreign bidders. Works would therefore be procured&#13;
following national competitive bidding (NCB) contracts let by the concerned central and state agencies&#13;
or by force account .&#13;
6.   Procurement under NCB procedures (US$ 28.5 million) would include all observation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
108&#13;
Annex 13b&#13;
Page 2&#13;
tubewells and new buildings. Works would be grouped into convenient packages for bidding. All&#13;
works contracts would be let using standard NCB documents and follows procedures satisfactory to&#13;
IDA. Foreign contractors would not be precluded from participation. Land acquisition, if necessary,&#13;
and detailed design and engineering of the works would precede invitations to bid. The total NCB&#13;
contracts (subject to further site investigation and survey) are tentatively distributed as follows:&#13;
Range of Contract Size                0.01 - 0.02              &gt;0.02&#13;

Most of the construction work involves contracts of less than US$ 100,000 which explains the&#13;
proportion of contracts under NCB procedures. For all contracts expected to cost US$ 1.0 million&#13;
or more, the contractors would be prequalified under terms and conditions acceptable to IDA.&#13;
7. Procurement under force account procedures acceptable to IDA (US$14.3 million) would&#13;
include all small works procurement of US$ 10,000 equivalent or less, up to an aggregate not&#13;
exceeding 33% of the total works. These works would not be suitable for competitive bidding&#13;
because the small to be procured are small and the works would be implemented over scattered&#13;
locations. The works would be carried out, either through forced account, or may be procured&#13;
under contracts awarded on the basis of bids invited from a list of at least three qualified&#13;
contractors eligible under the guidelines in accordance with procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
Equipment and Materials&#13;
8.  The project supports expenditures on equipment and materials valued at some US$ 48.5&#13;
million. The equipment comprises of the following broad categories: instrumentation and ancillary&#13;
equipment for surface water and groundwater observation sites; laboratory equipment; specialized&#13;
survey equipment; computers, ancillaries and software; communication equipment; office and&#13;
training equipment; and equipment of use in R&amp;D studies. With the procurement of all equipment,&#13;
an important project consideration would that the suppliers/manufactures can assure after-sales&#13;
service and spare parts so that the equipment and instruments can be sustained into the future.&#13;
Equipment and materials would be procured as follows:&#13;
9.  The project requires Instrumentation and Ancillary Equipment valued at US$ 19.1 million&#13;
and Laboratory Equipment valued at US$ 2.7 million. Of these amounts, US$ 13.9 million will&#13;
be bulked and procured following International Competitive Bidding (ICB) procedures. Where the&#13;
procurement of equipment items can be aggregated packages valued over US$ 200,000, they&#13;
would be procured by the concerned agency. Where the numbers of items of equipment for an&#13;
individual agency would be small, procurement of these goods would be centralized on the basis&#13;
of ICB procedures through tenders issued by MOWR in appropriately sized packages drawn up by&#13;
CWC and CGWB, as appropriate, after consultation with and agreement by concerned State&#13;
agencies. For bid comparisons, local manufacturers would be allowed a 15% margin of preference&#13;
or the applicable customs duty, whichever is lower. This equipment (US$ 7.9 million) would be&#13;
required by scattered offices in the States over the six year period. This equipment would available&#13;
locally and needs to be readily serviced through local facilities. Consequently, it would be&#13;
procured following NCB procedures (US$ 4.7 million) in contracts less than US$ 200,000, or&#13;
through local shopping (US$ 3.2 million) procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
10. Computers. Ancillaries and Software (US$ 20.0 million) and Communication Equipment&#13;
(US$ 1.6 million) would be procured through ICB procedures (US$ 17.0 million) by the&#13;
concerned agency.   Where the numbers of items of specialized equipment for an individual&#13;
agency would be small (estimated at about US$ 3.1 million), procurement of these goods in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
109&#13;
appropriately sized packages (in contracts less than US$ 200,000) would be on the basis of NCB&#13;
procedures. For bid comparisons, local manufacturers would be allowed a 15% margin of&#13;
preference or the applicable customs duty, whichever is lower. In addition, some propriety&#13;
equipment and software (US$ 1.5 million) would be directly purchased in accordance with&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
11. Specialized Survey Equipment (US$ 2.1 million), Office and Training Equipment (US$ 2.6&#13;
million); and Fquipment of use in R&amp;D studies (US$ 0.4 million) would be required by scattered&#13;
project offices in the States over the six year project period. The procurement would be by NCB&#13;
contracts let by the concerned agencies (US$ 2.2 million) or through local shopping procedures&#13;
(US$ 2.9 million) acceptable to IDA.&#13;
12. Vehicles valued at US$ 6.1 million would be required by each of the various implementing&#13;
agencies and at various times during the life of the project. The vehicles required for the first six&#13;
months of the project (25% of total requirements) would be procured by the concerned agencies&#13;
following NCB procedures (using available DGS&amp;D rate contracts) in packages below US$&#13;
200,000 equivalent, up to an aggregate of US$ 2.7 million. Subsequent procurements would&#13;
follow ICB procedures (US$ 2.5 million) or prudent shopping procedures acceptable to IDA,&#13;
below US$ 50,000 equivalent in contract size, up to an aggregate of US$ 0.9 million..&#13;
Set-vices&#13;
13. Consultant Services (US$ 8.4 million) would be contracted on terms and conditions in&#13;
accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and the&#13;
Woorld Bank as the Executing Agency". Services related to research and development (R&amp;D)&#13;
activities (US$ 0.7 million) to be provided by the concerned agencies using administrative&#13;
procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
14. Incremental Operating Costs (US$ 49.5 million) and Training Activities (US$ 6.4 million)&#13;
would be provided by the concemned agencies using administrative procedures acceptable to IDA.&#13;
The incremental operating costs includes expenditures on incremental staff, buildings and vehicles&#13;
to implement the project and incremental operating and maintenance (O&amp;M) costs, including the&#13;
maintenance of equipment, through the project period. All other staff costs would be financed by&#13;
the concerned agencies.&#13;
Review of Contracts&#13;
15. All contracts for works or equipment estimated at US$ 200,000 equivalent and above would&#13;
be subject to the Bank's prior review. The first three contracts, both for works and goods,&#13;
irrespective of value, would be subject to prior IDA review. Contracts of lesser value than US$&#13;
200.000 would be reviewed by IDA on a post-award sample basis. Invitation documents,&#13;
proposed awards and contracts for consultant services valued at US$ 100,000 or above for firms,&#13;
or US$ 50),()() or above for individual consultants, would be reviewed by IDA. This would result&#13;
in about 50% of the project procurement being subject to prior review. The nature of the project,&#13;
consisting of simple woriks anid standard equipment, is such that a higher level of IDA review&#13;
would not have a significant impact on procurement quality.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Central Water Commission Program&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The Central Water Commission (CWC), under the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR),&#13;
plays a vital national role in coordinating the development of surface water resources. It oversees&#13;
all major and medium projects that are primarily planned, designed, and implemented by the&#13;
individual States.This role acquires added responsibility when a project is located on an inter-State&#13;
river. Since its formation in 1950, the CWC has become the apex technical organization in the field&#13;
of water resources planning and development in India.&#13;
A. Existing Setup for Hydrological Observations and Data Management.&#13;
Organizational Setup&#13;
2.    The CWC has a total strength of about 6,500, of which 1,800 are civil engineers and other&#13;
professionals number about 1,500. The Commission has its head office at Delhi and has five&#13;
Regional Offices, of which two located at Hyderabad and Coimbatore fall within the HP area. The&#13;
Chairnan, CWC and ex-officio Secretary to GOI in the MOWR heads the organization. He is&#13;
assisted by three Members in charge of Design and Research, River Management, Water Planning,&#13;
and Planning and Progress.&#13;
3.    The hydrological field organizations of CWC in the HP area fall in the jurisdictions of&#13;
Chief Engineer (South-Central Region), Hyderabad, who is responsible for the river basins of&#13;
Godavari, Krishna, Mahanadi, Narmada, Tapi and other smaller rivers in the region and the Chief&#13;
Engineer (Southern Region), Coimbatore, who is in charge of the Pennar, Cauvery and other&#13;
southern river basins. The South-Central Region comprises four Circles, 11 Divisions and 42&#13;
Sub-divisions, while the Southern Region controls one Circle, three Divisions and nine&#13;
Subdivisions (Figure 1). At the headquarters of CWC, the Director (River Data Directorate) and&#13;
the Director (Statistics) look after storage of hydrological data received from the field&#13;
organizations. Each Circle in the field compiles and publishes a Water Year Book, a Sediment&#13;
Year Book and a Water Quality Year Book.&#13;
Existing River Gauging Network&#13;
4.    CWC has established its own network of hydrometric stations on the major river basins of&#13;
the country. At present it has about 570 river gauging stations of which 235 are located in the&#13;
project area with 185 in the South-Central Region and 50 in the Southern Region. The gauging&#13;
stations are classified according to the parameters measured at the site, which include: stage,&#13;
discharge, sediment load and water quality. In addition, there are some sites where stage&#13;
observations are made and /or discharges computed approximately for flood forecasting purposes,&#13;
and these are not counted as regular gauging sites. CWC also measures rainfall and other&#13;
meteorological parameters such as wind speed, temperature cloud cover, pan evaporation and&#13;
humidity at some of the gauging stations.&#13;
Measurine Procedures&#13;
5.    The observations of river depths, flow velocity, stage and other basic elements of discharge&#13;
measurements are recorded by the site-in-charge, who is a Junior Engineer or overseer for&#13;
important stations, and an experienced observer for other sites. The supporting staff depend on the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
118&#13;
Annex 15&#13;
Page 2&#13;
type of station and equipments used at the site. During monsoon, water levels are recorded every&#13;
hour (such short-interval data is necessary for flood studies). During the low flow season, stage&#13;
level observations are taken three times a day. Measurements of discharge are made once a day at&#13;
8 a.m. by the area-velocity method in accordance with the standard procedures. No flow&#13;
measurements are made on Sundays and official holidays. Velocities are generally measured by&#13;
cup-type current meters which are lowered from boats or from cableways. Depths are measured&#13;
by echo sounder or sounding rods. Widths of river segments are measured by wading for shallow&#13;
depths and by segmentation done by the pivot point method for larger widths. When use of boats&#13;
becomes unsafe, measurements are taken from nearby bridge or computed from slope.&#13;
Observations are recorded in standard formats. Stage and discharge values are plotted in the field&#13;
office, and when abnormal deviations are noticed, the computations are re-checked. The past&#13;
year's rating curves are superimposed to examine if the river bed is changing and to assess the&#13;
stability of the rating curve.&#13;
6.    Sediment and Water Quality Sampliny. Sediment samples are collected and analyzed&#13;
according to standard procedures. CWC carries out sediment analyses from 121 sites in the project&#13;
area. Water quality sampling commenced at some important sites in the early 1960s. The program&#13;
was initially undertaken for analysis of water samples covering eight parameters, but in due&#13;
course, the scope was enlarged to analyze up to 24 parameters. Water quality samples are now&#13;
taken from 131 gauging stations in the project area at intervals ranging from one to three times each&#13;
month. There is a Level I laboratory at every water quality observation site and Level II&#13;
laboratories at the Divisions.&#13;
7.    Data Processin    I and Manaeement. The discharge data collected in the field is arithmetically&#13;
checked to eliminate computational errors and sent to the Sub-divisional office where the Assistant&#13;
Engineer carries out scrutiny of the data in accordance with the prescribed guidelines and transmits&#13;
it to Division. At the Division, the data is again checked and compiled in the specified format for&#13;
transmittal to the Circle office where the data is finalized. The finalized data is then published in the&#13;
form of year books. Sediment and water quality data are processed in a similar manner. The water&#13;
year books are supplied to the concerned States and to CWC headquarters. A beginning has also&#13;
been made to integrate the data of both the CWC sites and the State sites and publish the combined&#13;
data in water year books. Computerization of data in the Divisional offices for upward transmittal&#13;
on floppy disks has been initiated, but most of the data in the Regions is on paper files. The hydro-&#13;
meteorological data collected at the sites are retained by the Divisional Offices and there is no&#13;
further processing, except for data incorporated into IMD's archives. The data from all sites is&#13;
accumulated at the CWC Headquarters in New Delhi where it is stored on computer files.&#13;
B. Improvements to the Hvdrological Observation System&#13;
Upgrading of Data Collection Infrastructure&#13;
8.    The CWC will not expand the existing observation network, but intends to upgrade the&#13;
existing stations in the HP area wherever necessary by providing new equipments and structures or&#13;
by replacing existing equipments. The important provisions under the project are:&#13;

provided with office furnishings, six air conditioners, a photocopier, a fax machine and a&#13;
generator.&#13;
Regional Surface Water Data Centers&#13;
12.    Data centers will be established at the two Regional Offices of CWC located at Hyderabad&#13;
and Coimbatore. The data from the hydrological stations and hydromet stations in the respective&#13;
regions would be transferred up through the divisional and circle hierarchy to the regional data&#13;
center for storage. Regional data centers will be provided with computer packages type C&#13;
comprising: two PCs (486dx2), two laser printers, one dot matrix printer, and a plotter, together&#13;
with two UPSs, an air conditioner, a fax machine, and office furniture. Software provided will&#13;
include: the surface water and water quality data systems, a hydrological package and a general&#13;
purpose package.&#13;
Data Processing Packages for Circles and Divisions&#13;
13.    The CWC field setup has been organized so that each Circle is in charge of one or more&#13;
specific river basins which in most cases extend over more than one State2. The Circle Office is&#13;
responsible for finalization of river flow data of all the hydrological stations under its jurisdiction&#13;
and also for publishing these data in the form of year books (para 3). To handle these works, the&#13;
Circle Offices would each be provided with a type D computer package comprising: two PCs&#13;
(486sx), two dot matrix printers, two UPSs, plus office furniture and an air conditioner, together&#13;
with software for the surface water and water quality data systems, and a general purpose package.&#13;
14.   A substantial part of the scrutiny and checking of the hydrological data is carried out at the&#13;
Divisions which will be supplied with type D computer packages together with surface water data&#13;
system and general purpose software packages. The Sub-divisions do initial scrutiny of discharge&#13;
computations submitted from the stream gauging sites. Some of the Subdivisions will therefore be&#13;
provided with a D type computer package for initial entry of the data into storage according to the&#13;
surface water data system format. A total of 33 D type computer packages will be supplied of&#13;
which 13 will be to the Southem Region and 20 to the South Central Region&#13;
Data Processing Packages for Laboratories&#13;
15.   The Level m laboratory at Hyderabad will be provided with a type C computer package&#13;
together with software for the water quality data system and a general purpose package. The three&#13;
Level II/Level H+ laboratories in the Southem Region and the seven Level II laboratories in the&#13;
South-Central Region will each be provided with computer package type D and software for the&#13;
water quality data system and for general purposes.&#13;
2     T'he four Circles of the South-Central Region are in charge of the Godavari Basin, the Krishna Basin, the&#13;
Mahanadi and Eastern rivers basins, and the Narmada, Mahi and Tapi basins and the minor basins of Gujarat, while&#13;
the Circle of the Southern Region is in charge of the Cauvery and Southem rivers basins.&#13;

Data Communication Systems&#13;
16.   The national surface water data center in CWC headquarters at Delhi would be provided&#13;
with a dedicated NICNET ground station. It is intended that CWC Regional Office data centers and&#13;
the State surface water data centers will also be linked with the local NICNET groundstation&#13;
through modems with dedicated telephone land lines. With these systems in place, there will be&#13;
sound communication systems between the national data centre, the CWC Regional Office data&#13;
centers and the State data centers. Transfer of data within the CWC hierarchy below the Regional&#13;
Office will be by dial-up linkage to the local NICNET groundstation or by floppy disk.&#13;
D. Institutional Strengthening&#13;
Buildings&#13;
17.   The office accommodations now available at the Regional Offices, and at Circle, Divisional&#13;
and Subdivisional levels are insufficient to carry out all the HP activities. Provision has been made&#13;
for additional accommodation as follows: (a) 400 m2 for each of the two Regional Offices; (b) 400&#13;
m2 for each of the five Circle Offices; (c) 500 m2 for each of the ten Divisional Offices; (d) 200 m2&#13;
for 30 Subdivisional Offices; (e) 100 m2 for 140 river gauging sites; and (f) five staff quarters.&#13;
Staffing Provisions&#13;
18.   It is not proposed to augment the existing staff for hydrological data collection by new&#13;
appointments. Wherever additional staff are necessary, they will be redeployed from surplus staff&#13;
elsewhere. However, it may be necessary to make new appointments to obtain the necessary skills&#13;
to establish the data center and to staff the laboratories. It is estimated that additional staff will have&#13;
to be obtained by new appointments at a total cost for salaries and allowances of about Rs.21.7&#13;
million over the life of the project for the entire CWC operation, averaging about Rs.3.6 million/yr.&#13;
Vehicles&#13;
19.   Vehicles would be provided as follows: (a) for CWC Headquarters - two cars; (b) for the&#13;
South-Central Region - 21 jeeps for field operations, nine jeeps for laboratories, and eight cars for&#13;
inspection duties; (c) for the Southern Region - nine jeeps and five motor cycles for field&#13;
operations, three jeeps for laboratories, three cars and two jeep station wagons for inspection&#13;
duties, and one minibus for training.&#13;
Training&#13;
20.   A major component of the training will comprise: (a) training of gauging site staff and&#13;
supervisory staff in the basic techniques of flow measurement sediment sampling and analysis, and&#13;
water quality sampling and on-site analysis; (b) training of junior staff of the laboratories in the use&#13;
of specialized equipment; and (c) training of mid-level professional staff in the use of computers&#13;
for data processing. Most of this training will be carried out in-house. Provision is made for&#13;
training of CWC staff in India and abroad through courses in institutions and through study tours.&#13;
The subjects in which training would be provided include hydrometry, data processing and&#13;
management, and hydrological analyses. The professional and technical staff in the laboratories&#13;
will also require training, and provision is made for training in Indian institutions and abroad. The&#13;
training inputs are shown in detail in Table 1.&#13;
National Water Academy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

21.    The MOWR is in the process of establishing a National Water Academy (NWA) with an&#13;
IDF grant of US$ 365,000 which was approved in late 1992. Setting up of NWA is being&#13;
supervised by the Central Training Unit of CWC in Pune. The NWA will conduct: (a) in-service&#13;
training for middle level officers, (b) policy seminars and workshops, and (c) state level training&#13;
programmes. The NWA would have a direct contribution to attaining the objectives of the HP and&#13;
therefore, HP would support the operation of the Academy. Allocations are made under the project&#13;
in support of NWA as follows: building (Rs.33 M); library (Rs.5.0 M); equipment (Rs.5.0 M);&#13;
and support for operational costs (Rs.1.485 M).&#13;
E. Procurement&#13;
Works&#13;
22.   Apart from the buildings required for the NWA (para 22), all of the building and other&#13;
CWC works under the CWC component of the project are of small scale and widely scattered.&#13;
None of the works would attract foreign competition. The works will therefore be implemented&#13;
either by LCB contracts according to Bank guidelines or by force account, as appropriate.&#13;
Goonds&#13;
23.   Implementation of the project will involve procurement of large quantities of specialized&#13;
hydrometric equipment, some specialized survey and laboratory equipment, and computer&#13;
hardware and software. These items will be procured centrally by ICB as discussed in para 4.04&#13;
of the SAR. The office equipment and furnishings will be procured by LCB or by prudent&#13;
shopping procedures. The vehicles for the first year will be procured by prudent shopping from&#13;
the manufacturers according to Government standard rate contracts. Subsequent vehicle&#13;
procurement will be by ICB or prudent shopping procedures, according to the size of the contract&#13;
package.&#13;
Services&#13;
24.   Consultant services will be procured by Central Government according to Bank guidelines&#13;
for foreign and local consultants. NIC services will be provided according to negotiated charges&#13;
and fees arranged by Central Government. All other services will be provided through force&#13;
account procedures.&#13;
F. Project Coordination. Monitoring and Evaluation and Review&#13;
Project Coordination&#13;
25.   A small Project Coordination Group will be established at CWC Headquarters, reporting to&#13;
the Chairman. Its function will be to coordinate all project related activities within CWC. The&#13;
group will also have responsibility for monitoring and evaluation and for the project annual&#13;
reviews as described below.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
26.   Monitoring and evaluation of CWC activities under the project will be carried out by the&#13;
Commission's Project Coordination Group (para 25). The exercise will cover both project&#13;
implementation progress and the performance of the data collection and management systems&#13;
developed. The results of the monitoring and evaluation will be reported in semi-annual progress&#13;
reports which will form the basis for the annual implementation reviews (para 27).&#13;

Project Annual Reviews&#13;
27.   An annual implementation review of the project will be undertaken under the direction of&#13;
the Central Project CoordinatingCommittee with the Bank not later than December 31 each year.&#13;
The review will provide the flexibility required to amend programs of the agencies and states in the&#13;
following fiscal year to reflect past performance and to incorporate any lessons learned into the&#13;
future programs. The CWC Coordinating Group will have the responsibility for presentation of&#13;
information on the Commission's part of the program for the annual review.&#13;

HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Central Ground Water Board Program&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB), under the Ministry of Water Resources&#13;
(MOWR), is the national apex agency for groundwater resources investigations and evaluations. It&#13;
was created in 1972 by the amalgamation of the Exploratory Tubewells Organization and a cadre&#13;
from the Geological Survey of India (GSI) which had been employed on groundwater&#13;
investigations. The Board has its headquarter at Faridabad, New Delhi. The CGWB plays a vital&#13;
role at the national level in planning the development of the groundwater resources throughout&#13;
India.&#13;
A. Existing Setup for Groundwater Observations and Data Management&#13;
Organizational Setup&#13;
2.    The CGWB is subdivided from the apex into two wings - Hydrogeological and&#13;
Engineering - and all data collection and management fall within the responsibility of the&#13;
Hydrogeological Wing, the Engineering Wing carrying out the drilling and pump-testing activities.&#13;
The Hydrogeological Wing has 12 regional offices under Regional Directors (Chart 1), six of&#13;
which are responsible for the Board's activities in seven participating states in HP-the regional&#13;
offices of: (i) Bhubaneswar for Orissa; (ii) Hyderabad for Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu; (iii)&#13;
Nagpur for Maharashtra; (iv) Bhopal for Madhya Pradesh; (vi) Ahmedabad for Gujarat; and (vi)&#13;
Trivandrum for Kerala. At present, a unit office in Madras, under the Hyderabad regional office,&#13;
has responsibility for activities in Tamil Nadu, but this unit will be upgraded to a regional office&#13;
early in the life of the project. The regional offices with jurisdictions outside the participating states&#13;
are located at Jaipur, Chandigarh, Lucknow, Calcutta and Guwahati.&#13;
Existing Groundwater Monitoring Network&#13;
3.    The CGWB's nationwide groundwater level and water quality monitoring network totals&#13;
about 16,000 observation points of which about 8,700 observation points (54%) are located in the&#13;
participating states. Some 95% of the total network in the participating states are open hand-dug&#13;
wells tapping the phreatic aquifer and are not the property of the Board; the remaining observation&#13;
points are tubewells tapping aquifers at various depths, and most of these were originally&#13;
constructed for exploration. The entire CGWB network in the participating states is manually&#13;
measured during fixed ten-day periods, four times each year in January, May, August and&#13;
November, and samples of water for chemical analysis are taken in May each year from the entire&#13;
network. In common with all the State groundwater observation networks, a significant proportion&#13;
of the open wells in the Board's network are failing to provide proper measurements at crucial&#13;
times because the wells are not being maintained by the owners or go dry due to water level decline&#13;
towards the end of the dry season. CGWB has the intention of replacing open wells by purpose-&#13;
built tubewells, but has made little progress in this regard. A breakdown of the CGWB network in&#13;
the seven participating states by well type is shown by Table I B of Annex 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
131&#13;
Annex 16&#13;

Existing Laboratory Facilities&#13;
4.    The CGWB has a central laboratory located in Lucknow, under an officer of Director&#13;
grade. It is supposed to be of Level IH grade and provide advanced analytical services relating to&#13;
chemical and biological pollution to the entire country. In addition, each of the remaining 11&#13;
regional offices have laboratory facilities of intended Level II standard. Thus, the Board has seven&#13;
Level II facilities to serve its activities in the eight participating project states. However, much of&#13;
the equipment is antiquated or unserviceable, and some of the laboratory buildings are less than&#13;
adequate for good scientific work. Given the growing importance of the development of&#13;
groundwater pollution in much of India from both point and non-point sources, the existing&#13;
laboratory facilities and staff of chemists maintained by CGWB are completely inadequate for the&#13;
Board to play its proper role in monitoring and evaluation of this development.&#13;
Data Processing and Management&#13;
5.    The CGWB headquarters in Faridabad has already started to use a computerized data&#13;
storage and retrieval system for water level and water quality data. However, the software has very&#13;
limited capability for data manipulation and processing. Moreover, there is no computerized&#13;
storage capability for the many other hydrogeological parameters which contribute to&#13;
understanding of groundwater systems. Similarly, the regional offices of CGWB have acquired&#13;
computers which are being used for storage of data collected from their groundwater monitoring&#13;
networks. All the offices use standard software for data management. The NIC system is not&#13;
generally used for data transfer between the regional offices and CGWB headquarters.&#13;
B. Improvements to the Groundwater Observation System&#13;
Upgrading of Data Collection Infrastructure&#13;
6.    The improvement to CGWB's groundwater monitoring network will include construction&#13;
of purpose-built observation tubewells at: (i) existing locations of open well observation sites&#13;
which are becoming unserviceable; (ii) new sites to monitor the phreatic aquifer systems; and (iii)&#13;
new sites to monitor deeper confined or semiconfined aquifer systems which are being exploited.&#13;
A proportion of the purpose-built observation tubewells will be equipped with digital water level&#13;
recorders. The total CGWB networks in the seven participating states will comprise about 8,800&#13;
observation points, the small reduction from the 8,060 locations presently monitored (para 3)&#13;
retlecting a rationalization of the CGWB network in Karnataka involving a reduction of&#13;
observation points from 1,226 sites to 635 sites. The improved networks will comprise: (i) 6,298&#13;
open well observation points which are manually measured four times each year; (ii) 226 tubewells&#13;
into the phreatic aquifers which are manually measured four times each year; (iii) 585 tubewells in&#13;
deeper aquifer which are manually measured four times each year; (iv) 995 tubewells in the&#13;
phreatic aquifers which are to be equipped with digital water level recorders; and (v) 698 tubewells&#13;
in deeper aquifers which are to be equipped with digital recorders. Statewise details of observation&#13;
network improvements are shown by Table 2.&#13;
Upgrading of Laboratory Facilities&#13;
7.    The project will upgrade the central laboratory at Lucknow to full Level HI capabilities and&#13;
the existing I 1 regional laboratories to Level II+ capabilities. In addition, the project will establish&#13;
a Level 11+ laboratory for the new regional office of CGWB to be established in Madras for&#13;
operations in Tamil Nadu. Four of the Level 11+ laboratories (Bhubaneswar, Bhopal, Hyderabad&#13;
and Madras) will be provided with new buildings. Therefore, in respect of laboratory facility&#13;
I     Dctails ol quantities and cost estimates for project inputs are shown by Table 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

package; a network package; and a WIS multiuser system. The data center will be provided with&#13;
office furnishings, six air conditioners, a photocopier, a fax machine and a generator. Provision is&#13;
made for modification of existing buildings to house the data center.&#13;
Regional Office Groundwater Data Centers&#13;
9.    The project will assist CGWB to establish data centers in each of the 12 existing regional&#13;
offices (para 2) and in the new regional office to be established in Madras to oversee the Board's&#13;
operations in Tamil Nadu. Thus as in the case of laboratory facility improvements (para 7) the&#13;
upgrading of data management facilities in CGWB will extend beyond the confines of the&#13;
participating states to have a national impact. The regional office data centers will be provided with&#13;
computer packages type B comprising: a file server (486dx2, EISA); five PCs (486dx2); two laser&#13;
printers; five dot matrix printers; a plotter (A3); a digitizer (A3 ) and six UPSs. The software to be&#13;
provided include: groundwater and water quality data systems; a specialized hydrogeological&#13;
package; a general purpose package; and a network package. In addition, the data centers will be&#13;
provided with office furnishings, a fax machine, a photocopier, two air conditioners and a&#13;
generator. Provision is made for modification of existing building to house the data centers and for&#13;
a new facility for the Madras regional office (para 16).&#13;
Data Processing PackaLes for CGWB Unit Offices&#13;
10.   The CGWB regional offices in Nagpur, Bangalore and Bhopal have unit offices in Pune,&#13;
Belgaum and Raipur respectively. The unit offices have areas of jurisdiction under their regional&#13;
offices in which they have responsibility for data collection. To assist in this process, they will be&#13;
provided with computer packages type D comprising: two PCs (486sx); two dot matrix printers;&#13;
and two UPSs. The software provided will include the groundwater data system and a general&#13;
purpose package. Additionally, these data processing setups will be provided with an air&#13;
conditioner and office furniture.&#13;
Computer Facilities for Laboratories&#13;
It.   The CGWB central laboratory in Lucknow and the 12 regional office laboratories will have&#13;
in-house computing capabilities. The central laboratory will be provided with a computer package&#13;
type C comprising: two PCs (486dx); two laser printers; a graphic plotter (A 3); and two UPSs.&#13;
The software will include the water quality data system and a general purpose package. In addition,&#13;
office furnishings and an air conditioner will be provided. The 12 regional laboratories will be&#13;
provided with computer package type D plus accessories and software for the water quality data&#13;
system and a general purpose package.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
133&#13;
Annex 16&#13;
Page 4&#13;
Data Communication System&#13;
12.   The central groundwater data center in Faridabad will be provided with a NICNET&#13;
dedicated groundstation. As the CGWB regional office for Maharashtra is located in Nagpur while&#13;
the state groundwater organization (SGO) headquarters is in Pune, it will be necessary to provide&#13;
the Nagpur office with a NICNET dedicated land line and modem connection so that it can&#13;
communicate directly with Faridabad and Pune, where the SGO data center will also have a&#13;
NICNET dedicated land line connection. In all other participating states, the CGWB regional&#13;
offices and the headquarters of the SGOs are in the same town or city and the corresponding&#13;
regional data centers and state data centers will be linked through NICNET by dedicated land lines&#13;
and these facilities will also provide a connection with Faridabad. The regional office data centers&#13;
in Jaipur, Chandigarh, Lucknow, Calcutta, and Guwahati will communicate with the Faridabad&#13;
headquarters using the NICNET services available in these cities through dedicated land lines with&#13;
modems. Transfer of data from unit offices and from laboratories to the respective regional office&#13;
data centers could be by floppy disc, though the unit offices may use a dial up telephone link to&#13;
NICNET.&#13;
D. Institutional Strengthening&#13;
Staffing Provisions&#13;
13.   The CGWB  has about 650 professional staff - hydrogeologists, hydrologists,&#13;
geophysicists, chemists, engineers and other scientists - supported by some 3,700 sub-&#13;
professional and technical staff and about 1,000 administrative and support staff. Given the&#13;
Board's mandate to explore, evaluate and monitor the development of the nation's groundwater&#13;
resources, essentially all the professional and technical staff are involved in the development and&#13;
management of hydrogeological data and information in the broadest sense.&#13;
14.   Since its establishment in 1972, CGWB has developed a high level of competence in a&#13;
wide range of hydrogeology-related activities. No major groundwater-related activity under HP&#13;
would be completely new to the specialized staff. But the scope of some project activities will be&#13;
much larger than previously experienced. And the organizational arrangements for implementing&#13;
some activities will involve radical change. For example, maintenance of the digital water level&#13;
recorders will require dedication of full time staff, while the manual measurement of the remaining&#13;
observation wells will continue to be implemented by concentrated application of all available staff&#13;
during 10 day periods, four times each year. While rational redeployment of staff will be used to&#13;
achieve many of the objectives of HP, some staff increases will be inevitable. Notably, the staffing&#13;
of the laboratories will have to be increased, experienced computer specialists will be required for&#13;
the data centers, additional field staff will be required to maintain the digital water level recorders,&#13;
the additional vehicles will require drivers, and the creation of a Regional Directorate in Madras&#13;
will involve a major staff increase. However, no basic changes in CGWB's organization are&#13;
anticipated. It is estimated that the total incremental costs of staff salaries and allowances for&#13;
implementing CGWB's component of HP will be about Rs.56.1 million, of which about Rs.2.4&#13;
million will be for the headquarters, Rs.49.7 million for the regional offices and Rs.4.0 million for&#13;
the National Training Institute (para 20).&#13;
Office Buildings and Equipment&#13;
15.   As noted (paras 9. 10). provisions are made for modification of existing buildings to house&#13;
the data centers to be created at the Faridabad headquarters and in the regional offices in&#13;
Bhubaneswar, Hyderabad, Bhopal, Ahmedabad, Bangalore and Nagpur. The project will support&#13;
the creation of: (a) new regional offices in Madras and Trivandrum through provision of new&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
134&#13;
Annex 16&#13;

buildings and office equipment; and (b) a National Institute for Groundwater Research and&#13;
Training at Raipur including the provision of buildings and equipment (para 20).&#13;
Vehicles&#13;
16.   The project will provide 42 jeeps to be distributed between the CGWB headquarters and the&#13;
regional offices in the eight participating states for field work and inspection. In addition, a jeep&#13;
will be provided for each of the 13 laboratories to be supported under the project (para 7). The&#13;
National Training Institute (para 20) will be provided with one saloon car, two jeeps and two&#13;
minibuses. The project estimates make provision for the running costs of the vehicles. Details of&#13;
the distribution of the vehicles are given in Table 1.&#13;
Training&#13;
18.   CGWB Staff - Basic Training. The hydrometric observers are all post graduates.&#13;
Therefore basic training will be restricted to training field staff in the use of digital water level&#13;
recorders and field monitoring kits. The laboratory technicians will be trained in the use of&#13;
specialized laboratory equipment and junior professionals in the use of computers for data&#13;
management. All this training will be provided in the National Training Institute (para 20). Details&#13;
are shown by Table 1. 12, Sheet 1.&#13;
19.   CGWB Staff - Advanced Training. The project makes provision for advanced training of&#13;
selected CGWB staff in hydrogeological and hydrochemical applications through short courses in&#13;
Indian and foreign institutions and study tours abroad (Table 1.12, Sheet 1).&#13;
20.   National Trainin2 Institute. The CGWB is presently in the process of establishing a&#13;
Groundwater Research and Training Institute at Raipur on land provided by GOMP. The activity&#13;
has Central Govemment sanction. The scope of the training and other activities to be undertaken by&#13;
the Institute covers a broader reach than the direct objectives of HP. However, special attention&#13;
will be given to groundwater management, including monitoring procedures and techniques for&#13;
groundwater quantity and quality indicators, and data base management using computers. The&#13;
project makes a provision of Rs.91 million for the building and some Rs.17.2 million for&#13;
equipment and furnishings, and Rs. 1.5 million for vehicles. The Institute will be used to provide&#13;
groundwater related training to the personnel of both CGWB and the SGOs.&#13;
Consultancv Services&#13;
21.   National and international consultants will be employed to assist with project management,&#13;
to provide specialized technical back-up, and to assist with the project's training programs. As the&#13;
consultancy inputs serve all participating agencies, they are accounted for separately and described&#13;
in Annex 10.&#13;
E. Procurement&#13;
Works&#13;
22.   Apart from the buildings for the Training Institute (para 20) and the new regional offices at&#13;
Madras and Trivandrum (para 16), all of the works under the CGWB component are of small scale&#13;
and widely distributed. They consist of some small new buildings, modification of existing&#13;
buildings and the construction of observation tubewells, the last being the most important works&#13;
components. All buildings will be constructed by LCB contracts. Most of the observation&#13;
tubewells will be constructed by LCB contracts with local drilling companies, but the wells of the&#13;
more difficult design may be constructed by force account using CGWB's own drilling equipment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
135&#13;
Annex 16&#13;

Goods&#13;
23.   Implementation of the project will involve procurement of specialized hydrometric&#13;
equipment such as digital water level recorders, some specialized laboratory equipment, and&#13;
computer hardware and software. These items will be procured centrally by ICB as described in&#13;
para 4.04 of the SAR. Office equipment and furnishings will be procured by LCB or by prudent&#13;
shopping procedures. The vehicles will be procured by prudent shopping from the manufacturers&#13;
according to Government standard rate contracts in the first year, and in subsequent years by&#13;
prudent shopping or by ICB procedures, according to the size of the package.&#13;
Services&#13;
24.   Consultant services will be procured by Central Government according to Bank guidelines&#13;
for employment of foreign and local consultants. NIC services will be provided according to&#13;
negotiated charges and fees arranged by Central Government. All other services will be provided&#13;
through force account procedures.&#13;
F. Project Coordination. Monitoring and Evaluation, and Review&#13;
Project Coordination&#13;
25.   A small Project Coordination Group will be established at CGWB headquarters, reporting&#13;
to the Chairrman. Its function will be to coordinate all project related activities within CGWB. The&#13;
group will also have responsibility for monitoring and evaluation and for project annual reviews as&#13;
described below.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
26.   Monitoring and evaluation of CGWB activities under the project will be the responsibility&#13;
of the Project Coordinating Group (para 24). The exercise will involve both monitoring progress&#13;
with project implementation and the performance of the data collection and management systems&#13;
developed. The results of the monitoring and evaluation will be reported in semi-annual progress&#13;
reports which will form the basis for the annual implementation reviews (para 26).&#13;
Project Annual Reviews&#13;
27.   An annual implementation review of the project will be undertaken under the direction of&#13;
the Central Project Coordinating Committee with Bank not later than December 31 each year. The&#13;
review will provide the flexibility required to amend programs of the agencies and states in the&#13;
following fiscal year and to incorporate any lessons learned into future programs. The CGWB's&#13;
own Coordinating Group will have the responsibility for presenting information on the Board's&#13;
component of the project for the annual review.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
National Institute of Hydrology&#13;
I.    Backround. The NIH was established at Roorkee in 1978 and is the apex agency in the&#13;
country for hydrology. Its main objectives are to undertake, promote and coordinate scientific&#13;
studies in hydrology, to deal with specific regional hydrological problems within India, and to&#13;
collaborate with other national and international organizations in the field of hydrology. The Institute&#13;
has facilities in Roorkee for computer systems, remote sensing applications and extension services.&#13;
It has established regional centers at Belgaum, Jammu, Guwahati, Patna and Kakinada, and a&#13;
regional center will be established at Sagar in the near future. The NIH currently has some 50&#13;
professional staff.&#13;
A. Existing Roles and Activities&#13;
2.    Research Activities. The selection of research topics is now often done on the basis of&#13;
individual experience and preference. The topics chosen do not necessarily address the actual&#13;
problems or needs of the water sector in India. As a result, NIH is undertaking research in a wide&#13;
range of hydrological topics, including some for which the need must be very limited. So long as the&#13;
Institute tries to embrace many fields of hydrology at the same time, it will be difficult to develop&#13;
sufficient expertise in any of them to introduce the use of these technologies to practical problems in&#13;
India. Therefore, in order for the NIH to play a role in the HP that meets the project's objectives, it&#13;
will have to reorient its activities towards providing services that have important practical application.&#13;
3.    Software Development and Application. and Data Processing. The NIH has already shifted&#13;
its earlier focus on software development towards software application. However, NIH should D21&#13;
have a role in data processing. The responsibility for data processing clearly rests with the staff of&#13;
the CWC, CGWB, and the concerned state agencies. The primary role of NIH should be in using&#13;
da  for studies, and the studies should be applied research which should be demand led. Thus, the&#13;
majority of the topics of studies should be identified and suggested by the state water agencies or by&#13;
the central agencies such as CWC and CGWB.&#13;
4.    Training. The NIH has conducted training courses for junior professionals and technicians&#13;
through short-term training courses at state level since 1985. It also carries out workshops at&#13;
Roorkee on specific aspects of hydrology such as computer applications and introduction of relevant&#13;
software.&#13;
5.    Regular Program. The approved program of NIH for 1994-99 includes the following&#13;
activities: (a) a compre. hensive study of one selected river basin; (b) software development; (c)&#13;
laboratory and field oriented work; (d) basic research; and (e) activities in conjunction with its&#13;
Regional Centers. It appears that few of these activities would relate to the objectives of the HP.&#13;
However, the NIH has indicated readiness and interest in expanding its activities in line with HP to&#13;
strengthen its role as national agency for applied research in hydrology.&#13;
B. Proposed Project Activities&#13;
6.    General. Project support to NIH would focus on institutional strengthening to firmly&#13;
establish its role in: (a) applied hydrology research for water resources development and&#13;
management; and (b) carrying out training activities related to hydrometry, hydrology and data&#13;
management for other central and state water agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
153&#13;
Annex 17&#13;
Page 2&#13;
7.    Applied Research. The project would support NIH (and other Indian institutions with the&#13;
capability of canying out R&amp;D - see Annex 8) in carrying out applied hydrology research activities&#13;
for central and state agencies on a demand basis. Although NIH has already identified a number of&#13;
specific study topics, these will have to be reviewed with participating states, together with other&#13;
proposals that would emerge during project implementation, in order to set priorities. This will&#13;
require more interaction between NIH and the states and other central agencies than is the case at&#13;
present. The project would support establishment and/or strengthening of three Regional Offices to&#13;
provide NIH with the necessary platforms for such actions, while they would also functioning as&#13;
bases from which the studies could be carried out. The two existing Regional Offices in Belgaum&#13;
(Karnataka) and Kakinada (Andhra Pradesh), and a new office to be established at Sagar (Madhya&#13;
Pradesh) would serve this purpose.&#13;
8.    Some studies have been identified in general terms that may be appropriate to specific areas&#13;
or projects. They include the following: (a) water balance studies; (b) design storms and flood&#13;
analysis; (c) reservoir operation studies; (d) flood routing studies; (e) regional hydrology studies; (f)&#13;
conjunctive water use studies; and (g) evaluation of actual performance of water projects against set&#13;
standards.&#13;
9.    Training of Trainers for State Agencies. NIH has already developed a capability for training&#13;
which would be strengthened and expanded to serve important training objectives of the project as&#13;
described in Annex 11 and summarized below. Within the state agencies, there is need for training:&#13;
(a) to improve data processing procedures; and (b) to develop skills in the use of computers and&#13;
software for water data management. Though much of this training would be an in-house activity of&#13;
the state agencies either through special courses or on-the-job training, there would be a necessity for&#13;
training of trainers who would be selected from state agency staff. A major responsibility of NIH&#13;
would be to provide for training of trainers in some of the required skills through short courses run&#13;
at Roorkee or in state training facilities such as WALMIs. NIH and the training consultants would&#13;
also advise the states on the content of the training courses which would be subsequently run in-&#13;
house by the state agencies using WALMI facilities. It should be noted that CGWB is in the process&#13;
of establishing a National Groundwater Research and Training Institute at Raipur (Annex 16) which&#13;
will provide training for state groundwater organization staff in at least some of the groundwater&#13;
related skills required by the project. Similarly, CWC is establishing a National Water Academy at&#13;
Pune (Annex 15). The activities of these training institutions will have to be properly accommodated&#13;
within NIH's training plans for support of HP.&#13;
10.   Specialized Training for State Agency Senior Staff. Senior professional staff of state surface&#13;
water and groundwater agencies will require training in advanced hydrological and hydrogeological&#13;
analysis techniques, including digital modelling using computers. The project will support the&#13;
provision by NIH of such training through courses of appropriate content and duration to be run&#13;
using facilities at Roorkee.&#13;
11.   Training f.QLNIH Staff. A provision is made under the project for training two selected staff&#13;
of NIH in advanced hydrological/hydrogeological procedures in foreign institutions and the project&#13;
will also finance five study tours abroad for selected NIH staff.&#13;
Details of Project Inputs (Table 1)&#13;
12.   Computing Facilities. The NIH Headquarters in Roorkee will be provided with a computer&#13;
package type C comprising: two PCs (486 dx), two laser printers, a graphic plotter and two UPSs,&#13;
plus a photocopier, fax machine, air conditioner and office furniture. The standard software for this&#13;
package (surface water, groundwater and water quality data systems, a specialized hydrological&#13;
package and a general purpose package) will be enhanced by additional specialized software and&#13;
technical literature. The regional offices of NIH in Belgaum, Kakinada and Sagar will each be&#13;
provided with computer package type D comprising: two PCs (486 sx), two dot matrix printers, and&#13;
two UPSs, plus air conditioners and office furniture, together with data systems software and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

general purpose software. In addition, NIH headquarters will be provided with a computer package&#13;
type D specifically for training activities. The cost estimates for NIH activities includes an allowance&#13;
for recurrent costs for running the computers and ancillary equipment. The capital cost of the&#13;
computing facilities and software is about Rs.9.7 million.&#13;
13.   Instruments. A lump sum allocation of Rs. 1.0 million is made for purchase of specialized&#13;
hydrological instruments and equipment for testing by NIH staff under field conditions and/or use in&#13;
training activities.&#13;
14.   Research and Development. As noted (paras 7 and 8), a fund would be established under the&#13;
project to finance selected applied research studies which could be implemented by NIH (or other&#13;
qualified R&amp;D agencies) on behalf of state agencies or central agencies. The lump sum allocation for&#13;
this component is Rs. 15 million.&#13;

D. Project Coordination. Monitoring and Evaluation &amp; Review&#13;
25.   Project Coordination. A small Project (R&amp;D) Coordination Group will be established in&#13;
NIH, reporting to the Director of the Institute. An important function of the group will be liaison&#13;
with CWC, CWPRS, CGWB, IMD and the concerned agencies in the seven states. The Project&#13;
(R&amp;D) Coordination Group will also have the responsibility for project monitoring and evaluation of&#13;
R&amp;D activities, and project reviews as described below.&#13;
25.   MonitorinLwndEvaluation. The monitoring and evaluation of the NIH component of HP&#13;
will be carried out by the Project (R&amp;D) Coordination Group (para 25). The exercise will involve&#13;
both monitoring implementation progress and the quality of performance of the activities undertaken&#13;
by NIH. The results of the monitoring and evaluation will be reported semi-annually and form the&#13;
basis for the annual implementation reviews (para 27).&#13;
26.   Project Annual Reviews. An annual implementation review of the project will be&#13;
undertakenunder the direction of the Central Project Coordinating Committee (SAR, para 5.19) with&#13;
the Bank not later than December 31 each year (SAR, para 5.33). The annual review arrangement&#13;
will provide the flexibility required to amend programs to reflect past performance, and to&#13;
incorporate any lessons learned into future programs. The Project (R&amp;D) Coordinating Group in&#13;
NIH will have responsibility for presentation of information on the performance of the Institute's&#13;
part of the project for the annual implementation review.&#13;

HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Central Water and Power Research Station Program&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The Central Water and Power Station (CWPRS) established in 1916 and located in Pune,&#13;
is an autonomous agency under the Ministry of Water Resources (MOWR). It provides&#13;
hydrological services in the fields of irrigation, hydropower and water transport. The&#13;
Instrumentation Division of CWPRS was assisted in its activities by two UNDP supported&#13;
projects - Development of Hydraulic Instrumentation and Hydraulic Instrumentation Center -&#13;
during 1972 to 1984. The projects provided training of engineers and scientists through&#13;
fellowships abroad and by visits of consultants in hydrometry. The projects also provided&#13;
support for buildings and for procurement of equipment.&#13;
2.    CWPRS carries out current meter calibration as a routine activity for some states but the&#13;
ancillary equipments and facilities to back-up the basic facility are lacking. Moreover, only minor&#13;
repairs can be carried out, no spare parts are held in stock, and the tum-round time for calibrating&#13;
instruments is too long. Hydrological R&amp;D studies have also been carried out by the agency for&#13;
some states. Apart from these activities, the links between CWPRS and the state hydrology&#13;
agencies are weak.&#13;
CWPRS Activities under the Project&#13;
3.    Current Meter Calibration. CWPRS will continue to provide services for current meter&#13;
calibration to some of the participating states. The basic facilities available are very good, but the&#13;
supporting workshop equipment requires serious upgrading.&#13;
4.    Inspection of River Gauging Sites. The services of an inspection team from CWC and&#13;
CWPRS will be required by all the participating states for the establishment and operation of river&#13;
gauging stations. The CWPRS representative on the inspection team will mainly advise on the&#13;
selection of gauging equipment and on its subsequent operation and maintenance.&#13;
5.    Selection and Evaluation of Advanced River GaugingEquiprent. Some states plan to&#13;
introduce the use of advanced types of river gauging equipment under HP. Examples are the&#13;
acoustic doppler current profiler set proposed for Karnataka and the pressure transducer and&#13;
logger type water level recorders proposed for Karnataka and Orissa. In order to benefit from&#13;
CWPRS experience with such equipment at the research station, CWPRS would be involved in&#13;
the installation and initial operation of the equipment. CWPRS would evaluate the suitability of&#13;
the new equipment in a report describing its performance as compared with more traditional&#13;
technology. The report would consider the practical implications of introducing the equipment,&#13;
including the staff requirements for operation and maintenance, the capital and recurrent costs, and&#13;
procedures required for data processing and for quality control of data recorded.&#13;
6.    Training. CWPRS could contribute instructors to the 'Training of Trainers" courses at&#13;
NIH and state agency courses for field staff and junior supervisors at the WALMIs (see Annex&#13;
11). The main subjects of CWPRS instructors would be the use and maintenance of standard&#13;
equipment for water level, stream flow and sediment transport observations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

7.    Research andDevelopmen. The CWPRS is staffed and equipped to carry out demand-&#13;
driven applied research in many aspects of surface water and groundwater hydrology on behalf of&#13;
the participating states. The agency will therefore be able to participate in the R&amp;D program that&#13;
will develop as the project proceeds, with the conditions that: (a) their assistance is requested by a&#13;
state agency; and (b) the proposed R&amp;D study is cleared by the R&amp;D Evaluation Committee for&#13;
funding from the lump sum allocation for R&amp;D under the project budget (see Annex 8). In&#13;
addition, the project provides a direct budget allocation to CWPRS for R&amp;D on hydrological&#13;
instrumentation (para 9).&#13;
Details of Project Provisions for CWPRS&#13;
8.    Insruments fLrTesting. The project provides for the procurement by CWPRS of a range&#13;
of instruments used in hydrometry for testing purposes. The instruments include: several types of&#13;
current metering packages of foreign and local origin, with propeller and cup type meters; an&#13;
electromagnetic current meter set; four optical shaft encoder water level sensors; six pressure type&#13;
water level sensors; and two pneumatic type water level sensors. The estimated cost of this&#13;
package of instruments is about Rs.2.3 million.&#13;
9.    Reserch and Development. The project provides a lump sum allocation of Rs.5.0 million&#13;
to CWPRS to carry out practical research on hydrological instrumentation on behalf of HP.&#13;
CWPRS may also participate in more general R&amp;D activities on behalf of state agencies (para 7).&#13;
10.   Training of CWPRS Professional Staff. A small training input for study tours abroad is&#13;
provided under the project at an estimated cost of some Rs.0.63 million.&#13;
11.   Vehicles. The project will provide one saloon car and one jeep for the use of CWPRS in&#13;
HP activities at an estimated cost of Rs.550,000.&#13;
12.   Travelling Expenses. A lump sum allocation of Rs. 1.0 million is made in the project costs&#13;
to cover the travelling expenses in India of CWPRS staff on HP activities.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
India Meteorological Department Program&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The India Meteorological Department (IMD), under the Ministry of Science and&#13;
Technology, is the central government organization that deals with all aspects of meteorology.&#13;
Established in 1875 as a scientific department, it is organized primarily to provide a meteorological&#13;
service to the nation. The department obtains its rainfall and general climatic data from its own&#13;
network or from approved stations managed by other government agencies. It operates coastal&#13;
radars for detection of cyclones, radars for detection of thunderstorms, and makes upper air&#13;
observations and air pollution measurements. IMD caters to the needs of a large number of&#13;
interests, notably the requirements of aviation, shipping, agriculture and irrigation, flood&#13;
forecasting and large reservoir operations. Special importance is given to rainfall measurements&#13;
and data from around 5,000 observation sites are stored at the department's computerized National&#13;
Data Center at Pune. The department has developed training capabilities in all aspects of&#13;
meteorology, and it training center at Pune is approved by WMO as the regional training center for&#13;
South Asian countries.&#13;
Organizational Set-up&#13;
2.    With headquarters in New Delhi and a technical center in Pune, IMD operates through five&#13;
regional meteorological centers located in New Delhi, Calcutta, Bombay, Madras and Nagpur. It&#13;
has meteorological centers in every state. As noted above (para 1), its data management center and&#13;
main training facilities are located at Pune. Training units are also located in New Delhi, Calcutta&#13;
and Madras to provide basic training to junior staff.&#13;
IMD Participation in HP&#13;
3.    The IMD sets standards for all meteorological activities in India and, in general, carries out&#13;
its scientific work according to procedures recommended by WMO. The department manufactures&#13;
all commonly used meteorological equipments for its own use and can be a supplier to other&#13;
government agencies. Moreover, IMD, together with the Bureau of Indian Standards, has set&#13;
specifications for all instruments, under which local manufacturers can market their products, and&#13;
IMD will individually calibrate and certificate the instruments produced by manufacturers for a fee.&#13;
In addition, it has standardized specification for site selection and civil works for meteorological&#13;
stations, and has established procedures and formats for data collection and processing. The&#13;
department has an internationally accepted training establishment (para 1). With this background&#13;
and these attributes, IMD will actively participate in the implementation of HP as the primary&#13;
advisor on all technical matters relating to the meteorological program (Annex 6), will establish&#13;
computerized data centers at its Regional Meteorological Centers in Nagpur, Calcutta, Bombay,&#13;
Madras and the state meteorological centers in Ahmedabad, Bhubaneswar, Trivandrum,&#13;
Hyderabad, Bangalore and Bhopal (Annex 7). It will also contribute in its expertise in the training&#13;
program (Annex 10), as discussed in para. 9 of this Annex. The base costs of the IMD program is&#13;
estimated at about Rs. 181.6 million detailed in Table I of this Annex.&#13;
4.    Project Coordination. A project coordination unit will be established under an Additional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Director General (ADG) in the New Delhi regional office building. The project will provide office&#13;
furnishing and equipment for this unit The unit will function exclusively to coordinate IMD's&#13;
program under HP with other central agencies and concemed state agencies.&#13;
5.    Inventory and Review of Existing Meteorological Networks. Before final decisions are&#13;
made on upgrading and expanding existing meteorological networks, it will be necessary to&#13;
inventory the CWC and state surface water agency networks in the participating states to identify&#13;
site and instrumentation defects, and to assess the effectiveness of the measurement and record&#13;
keeping procedures at the stations. This will be followed by a review of the entire state&#13;
meteorological networks to determine any network modifications or additions required to obtain&#13;
optimum coverage for reliable meteorological analysis. These activities will be carried out by the&#13;
concerned state/central hydrological agencies with the assistance and guidance of experienced&#13;
officers from IMD, and supported by the implementation consultants to be employed under the&#13;
project.&#13;
6.    Site Selection. Design and Instrumentalion. As noted (para 5), IMD will be involved in the&#13;
network inventory which will identify site and instrumentation defects and propose measures for&#13;
improvements. In all respects, observation stations will be upgraded to meet IMD standards. The&#13;
actual location of proposed new stations will be subject to IMD approval, and the civil works and&#13;
instrumentation will be to IMD standards. Thus, experienced IMD officers (or national consultants&#13;
employed by IMD) will function as advisors for this part of the work.&#13;
7.    Operations Inspections for Oualitv Control. The quality of the data collected at&#13;
meteorological observation sites is finally dependant on the performance of the site operators in&#13;
equipment maintenance and observation procedures. In addition, site exposure conditions must&#13;
also be maintained. In order to ensure that the above conditions are achieved, a regular process of&#13;
site inspections will be established. IMD officers will assist the agencies in setting up the&#13;
inspection processes and will actively participate in the inspections during the project.&#13;
8.    Establishment of RegionaVSub-Regional Data Centers in IMD. At present, IMD's National&#13;
Data Center at Pune is the only place that meteorological data users can access the department's&#13;
data base. An important project initiative will be to establish computerized data banks for&#13;
meteorological data in Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Nagpur, Ahmedabad, Bhubaneswar, Bhopal,&#13;
Hyderabad, Bangalore and Trivandrum. These data centers will function for initial verification and&#13;
entry into computer storage of meteorological data from the IMD stations, and also as entry points&#13;
into the data base for user agencies. The data from the state hydrometeorological observation&#13;
networks will first be stored in the state surface water data banks, and will then be copied by&#13;
floppy disk to the meteorological center of IMD in the state capital. The data will be transferred to&#13;
IMD's National Data Center (pune) for final verification and then retumed to the state center for&#13;
archiving. The Pune data center will be provided with a computer package type as specified in&#13;
Section 2.31 of Table 2, Annex 2. The data centers at IMD's regional and state meteorological&#13;
centers (para 3) will be provided with computer packages type B and Type C respectively (detailed&#13;
in Section 2.32 and 2.33 of Table 2, Annex 2). All IMD data centers will be provided with&#13;
software for the meteorological data system and for general purposes. The data will be transferred&#13;
to IMD's National Data Center by floppy disk. The software will include: the hydromet data&#13;
system, a UNIX operating system and a general purpose package. The data center will be&#13;
provided with office furnishings, air conditioners, a photocopier, a fax machine and a generator.&#13;
9.    Training for Meteorological Staff of CWC/State Surface Water Agencies. IMD's training&#13;
experience and training facilities will be utilized for project purposes. IMD will provide the initial&#13;
training courses for site observers and junior professional supervisory staff, and will be a source&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
163&#13;
AnnexS 19&#13;
Page 3&#13;
of training for selected senior professional staff from state agencies with the background to become&#13;
specialists in meteorology. Thus, IMD will provide:&#13;
(a) basic training courses of four weeks duration for about 3,000 hydromet observers&#13;
distributed in the participating states using the training facilities available at Calcutta, Madras&#13;
and Pune;&#13;
(b) training courses of six weeks duration for about 400 hydromet supervisors (Junior or&#13;
Assistant Engineer rank) using the central training facility at Pune; and&#13;
(c) advanced/refresher courses of four weeks duration for about 75 senior staff (Executive or&#13;
Superintendent Engineer rank) using the central training facility at Pune.&#13;
The project will also provide training aids and equipment to serve the training program. The&#13;
training program will be administered by an ADG appointed specially for this purpose.&#13;
10.   Buildings. No major construction of additional buildings is required for any of the&#13;
IMD offices to be utilized for project purposes except for small storage/garage facilities.&#13;
However, some modifications to existing buildings will be required for the establishment of&#13;
the 11 data centers (para 8). Minor civil works will also be required for installation of&#13;
observatory equipment for the three training centers in the states (para 9). A training hostel&#13;
will be taken on rent at Calcutta until the new building is completed.&#13;
11.   Calibration of Equipment. The IMD have facilities at Pune to test and calibrate&#13;
scientific instruments used for hydrometeorological measurements. Provision is made&#13;
under the project to upgrade and improve these facilities to reflect the increased numbers of&#13;
instruments which will have to be tested and calibrated on a routine basis.&#13;
12.   Vehicles. The project coordination office in New Delhi will be provided with a&#13;
saloon car for the use of the ADG (Coordination). The Pune training center will be&#13;
provided with one four-wheel drive jeep. The eight regional/state offices in Bombay,&#13;
Madras, Trivandrum, Hyderabad, Bangalore, Ahmedabad, Bhopal and Bhubaneswar&#13;
which will be involved in the inventory of existing meteorological networks (para 5), site&#13;
selection for new observatories (para 6) and inspection work (para 7) will each be provided&#13;
with two four wheel drive jeeps for field work.&#13;
13.   Overseas Study Tours. A provision is made under the project for overseas study&#13;
tours for about 24 IMD scientists abroad for periods of aboutfour weeks each. Fields of&#13;
study will include recent advances in data management and in hydrometeorology.&#13;
14.   Incremental Implementation Staff. It will be necessary for IMD to increase its&#13;
establishment to implement its component of the project. The staff build-up will take place&#13;
over the first two years of the project and remain stable thereafter. The estimated cost of the&#13;
salaries and allowances for project implementation staff is estimated at about Rs.61.1&#13;
million over the six year life of the project. The project also provides for some Rs.7.6&#13;
million for staff travel (other than for overseas tours which is costed separately). Both&#13;
incremental staff costs and travel allowances are based on costs and salary scales as of July&#13;
1994. Annual increases in salary scales and travel costs over the project period have been&#13;
provided for under the physical and price contingenices added to the base costs (see Annex&#13;
2).&#13;

Introduction&#13;
1.    With a land area of about 275,100 km2 and a population of some 53.5 million in 1989,&#13;
Andhra Pradesh (AP) is the fifth largest State in India both in area and population. It lies along the&#13;
east coast and has a generally hot and humid climate with summer temperatures in May and June&#13;
reaching 450C in some central and northern districts. The mean annual rainfall varies from about&#13;
1,200 mm in the mountainous north to 500 mm in the south. Rainfall is principally provided by the&#13;
south-west monsoon with the north-east monsoon contributing about one-third of the annual&#13;
rainfall.&#13;
2.    Section A of this annex describes existing systems for hydrological observations and data&#13;
management; Section B summarizes proposed improvements to the observation systems; Section C&#13;
describes the establishment of interactive computerized data banks and inter-bank communication&#13;
systems; Section D summarizes proposed improvements in reservoir instrumentation and&#13;
management; Section E describes the proposed improvements in the monitoring of return flows&#13;
from selected irrigated command areas; Section F covers real time water resources management&#13;
through improved flood warning systems; Section G summarizes institutional strengthening&#13;
activities; Section H refers to procurement procedures; and Section I describes arrangements for&#13;
project performance monitoring and evaluation and for project review.&#13;

Development (DOICAD. The Hydrology Circle contains three River Gauging Divisions located at&#13;
Hyderabad, Karimnagar and Nakerkal which control three, six and four Sub-Divisions respectively&#13;
. In addition to the three field Divisions, there is a Hydrology and Statistics Division in Hyderabad.&#13;
4.    River Gauging Stations. The three gauging Divisions of the DOICAD operate 138 stations,&#13;
which measure both stage and discharge. Suspended sediment is measured at only two stations,&#13;
and water quality is not routinely monitored. The Central Water Commission (CWC) operates 34&#13;
stage/discharge stations in AP. Water quality is monitored at 22 of the CWC stations, and&#13;
suspended sediment is measured at 13 of the sites.&#13;
5.    Laboratory Facilities. As water quality is not routinely monitored by the gauging Divisions.&#13;
DOICAD does not have its own laboratory facilities. The water samples collected by CWC are&#13;
analyzed at the divisional laboratories.&#13;
6.    Data Processing and Management. Discharge measurements are obtained by trained&#13;
technicians at the DOICAD observation sites. The discharge is computed by a Junior Engineer (JE)&#13;
or Deputy Executive Engineer (DEE). The stage readings and discharge measurements are&#13;
submitted in a prescribed format to the Divisional office where data are finalized, tabulated and&#13;
stored in registers. At present, DOICAD does not publish riverflow data and computers are not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

used for managing the data. Data collected from the CWC observation sites are processed and&#13;
stored according to standard procedures (Annex 5).&#13;
Groundwater Hydrology&#13;
7.    Organizational Setup. A Ground Water Directorate (GWD) was established under the&#13;
DOICAD in 1971. It is functionally organized into five wings for hydrogeology, hydrology,&#13;
chemistry, geophysics and drilling, each under a Deputy Director, and there is an administrative and&#13;
accounts wing. There are 22 district offices and these have multifunctional responsibilities. The&#13;
GWD has about 400 professional staff comprising hydrogeologists, geophysicists, hydrologists,&#13;
chemists and civil and mechanical engineers.&#13;
8.    Groundwater Monitoring Networks. The DOICAD monitoring network consists of 3,189&#13;
wells, with 1,065 wells in the iirigation command areas (mainly concerned with monitoring of water&#13;
logging) and the remaining 2,064 wells outside the major surface water command areas. The&#13;
locations outside command areas are monitored as follows: a) all wells provide a weekly&#13;
measurement taken by local observers which are mailed to GWD on special prepaid post cards; b) 45&#13;
wells are measured monthly by Directorate observers; c) 250 wells are measured bimonthly by&#13;
Directorate observers; and d) 1,769 wells provide pre- and post-monsoon water levels taken by&#13;
Directorate observers. Of the command area wells, 315 are measured five times a year and 770 are&#13;
measured twice a year by Directorate observers. Water samples are taken for quality analyses twice a&#13;
year from all wells (pre- and post-monsoon).&#13;
9.    The Regional Office of Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) in Hyderabad maintains a&#13;
network of 1,034 observation wells in AP which are monitored for water levels duling 10-day&#13;
periods four times each year (January, May, August, November). Water samples are taken for&#13;
analysis once a year in May. The water levels are measured manually. Only 73 of the water&#13;
obser-vation points are tubewells, and the remaining observation points are open wells which are not&#13;
the property of the Board.&#13;
10.   Laboratory Facilities. The GWD has established water quality laboratories at Hyderabad,&#13;
Cuddapah, Rajahmundry and Kurnool. Chemical analyses include determination of pH, EC, TDS&#13;
and major cations and anions. Around 7,500 samples are analyzed annually. About 3,000&#13;
obser-vation wells are sampled. Other samples are taken during drilling and other investigations. The&#13;
laboratories are fairly well established, but much of the equipment is old.&#13;
l 1.   The CGWB Regional Office in Hyderabad operates a fairly well established laboratory of the&#13;
Level II category with experienced staff, but most of its equipment is old. The laboratory was&#13;
established in 1973 with assistance of CIDA and is equipped to determine the standard chemical&#13;
parameters of water for irrigation and drinking purposes. The current workload of about 3900&#13;
samples includes the annual sampling in May of the Regional Office's observation networks in&#13;
Andhra Pradesh and Tamil Nadu, re-appraisal surveys, exploratory drilling, short-term&#13;
investigations for water supply, and pollution studies. There are no facilities for the analysis of&#13;
heavy metals and micro organic pollutants.&#13;
12.   Data Processing and Management. Part of GWD's data has been processed using computers.&#13;
The CGWB Regional Oftice has some computing facilities but, to date, only the historical water&#13;
level data have been stored in computer files.&#13;
Hvydiometeorology&#13;
13.   Organizational Setup. In common with all the states of India, several state agencies in AP&#13;
maintain networks of rainfall observation stations, including the Revenue Department (RD), the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
168&#13;
Annex 2&#13;
Page 3&#13;
DOICAD and the Department of Agriculture (DOA). In addition, the Indian Meteorological&#13;
Department (IMD) has a small network of climate stations in AP, and CWC also manages a small&#13;
number of rainfall and climatic stations.&#13;
14.   Hydrometeorological Networks. The total number of rainfall stations in the State is about&#13;
778. DOICAD operates a network of 381 rainfall stations which are equipped with standard&#13;
raingauges (SRG). CWC maintains 43 rainfall stations in the state equipped with SRGs and 13 with&#13;
autographic rain gauges (ARG). In addition, IMD operates 39 stations, including 11 full&#13;
climatological stations (FCS). The RD maintains 300 SRG stations.&#13;
15.   Data Processing and Management. Computers are not used for storage and management of&#13;
the rainfall and other climate data collected by the various state agencies and CWC in AP. IMD uses&#13;
computers for storage of data from its own and approved rainfall stations in AP at the IMD Data&#13;
Center in Pune.&#13;
B. Proposed Improvements to Hydrological Observations Systemsl&#13;

laboratories have yet to be selected, but they should be capable of handling the samples taken from&#13;
about 45 gauging sites. The CWC laboratory at Hyderabad Regional Office will be upgraded to&#13;
Level III. Details of the equipment to be provided and the analyses to be carried out by each type of&#13;
laboratory are discussed in Annex 5.&#13;
Groundwater Hvdrologv&#13;
18.   Upgrading of Data Collection Infrastructure. The GWD network of observation wells will&#13;
increase from 3,149 locations that are monitored at present to 3,379 locations after completion of the&#13;
project. The improved network will comprise 350 tubewells equipped with digital water level&#13;
recorders, 275 tubewells which will be manually measured, and 2,754 open wells which will be&#13;
manually measured. The CGWB Regional Office observation network will increase from the present&#13;
1,034 wells to 1,159 wells after completion of the project. The network will include 165 tubewells&#13;
equipped with digital water level recorders, 108 tubewells which will be manually measured, and&#13;
886 open wells which will be manually measured. Details of the improvements to be provided to the&#13;
state network are given in Table 1. Reference should be made to Annex 4 for more detailed&#13;
discussion of groundwater network improvements.&#13;
19.   Improved Laboratorv Facilities. The  water quality monitoring workload is expected to&#13;
increase substantially. Groundwater pollution studies need to be taken up. Strengthening of the four&#13;
existing laboratories is proposed. The central facility at Hyderabad will be upgraded to Level 11+ and&#13;
the three regional laboratories at Cuddapah, Rajahmundry and Kumool will be upgraded to Level II.&#13;
The CGWB Regional Office laboratory at Hyderabad will be upgraded to Level II+. Details of the&#13;
equipment to be provided and the analyses to be performed for each type of facility are discussed in&#13;
Annex 5.&#13;
20.   Field EQuipment. Special Area Studies and Baseflow Measurements. The GWD will be&#13;
provided with 20 field monitoring kits and six portable compressors. The GWD will be provided&#13;
with the following equipment for special catchment area studies alnd baseflow measurements: two&#13;
standard current meter packages; two pigmy current meter sets; two bridge outfits for current&#13;
metering; 16 digital water level irecorders and associated works; and 16 staff gauges.&#13;
Hyvdrometeorolo,gy&#13;
21.   Improvements to Observation Network. The DOICAD network will be improved by&#13;
installation of eight FCSs and 80 ARGs. A lump sum provision is made for replacement of defective&#13;
or missing equipment at existing hydrometeorological observation sites in the DOICAD network..&#13;
C. Improvements to Data Management and Communication Systems&#13;
Upgrading of Data Management Systems&#13;
22.   General. Separate state data centers would be established for surface water and for&#13;
groundwater information. The surface water data center would be managed by a new entity to be&#13;
created within DOICAD and to be located in Hyderabad (see para 38). The new unit would be a&#13;
Circle within the jurisdiction of the CE (Investigations) which would incorporate the three river&#13;
gauging Divisions and the Hydrology and Statistics Division (para 3) and the laboratories to be&#13;
established under the project (para 17). The state groundwater data center would be established as a&#13;
special unit within GWD and would be located in Hyderabad. The CWC's stream gauging and&#13;
hydrometeorological observation networks in AP are managed by a CE located in Hyderabad and&#13;
this office would become a regional data center for exchange of data with state agencies. The CGWB&#13;
Regional Office in Hyderabad would establish a data center for information collected from its&#13;
observation network. The data management systems of the four agencies would be fully&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
170&#13;
Annex 20&#13;
Page 5&#13;
computerized with software designed so that the data bases could be interactive. Reference should be&#13;
made to Annex 7 for more detailed discussion of data management and data transfer systems.&#13;
23.   Checking and Entry of Historical Data into Computer Storage. This section refers mainly to&#13;
riverflow data collected by the Hydrology Divisions of DOICAD. All their data is now on paper&#13;
files. Although at least part of this data may be of doubtful quality, it must be recognized that it is, at&#13;
present, all that is available. Therefore, these existing data series must- be stored for use until such&#13;
time that a long series of higher validity becomes available. Nevertheless, some validation of the data&#13;
must be made to remove obviously anomalous observations before data are entered into computer&#13;
storage or, alternatively, a computer routine could be used to recognize possible anomalies after the&#13;
data are entered. It is evident that this exercise will be very subjective and will require care in&#13;
application. The next opportunity to review the historical data will be offered when a validated data&#13;
series is developed through project activities at a stable site where a secure rating curve can be&#13;
derived. If comparison of the rating curve with historical stage/discharge measurements reveals a&#13;
'systematic error' in the discharge measurements, it may then be possible to 'correct' the data series&#13;
for the site.&#13;
24.   State Surface Water Data Management System. The data collected from the DOICAD's river&#13;
gauging stations are first accumulated in the Subdivisional offices of the river gauging Divisions&#13;
after collection from the gauging sites by the concerned section offices. The three Divisional and 13&#13;
Subdivisional offices would be provided with computer package type D comprising: two personal&#13;
computers (486 sx) and two dot matrix printers, plus UPSs, associated office furniture and an air&#13;
conditioner, together with surface water data system and general purpose software. Data will be&#13;
verified and entered into computer storage at the Subdivisions. Transfer of data to the Divisional&#13;
offices for checking and thence to the surface water data center will be by a dial-up NICNET&#13;
connection or by floppy disk. The two surface water quality laboratories (para 19) will be provided&#13;
with computer package type D with water quality data system and general purpose software.&#13;
Transfer of data from the laboratories to the surface water data center will be by a dial-up NICNET&#13;
connection or by floppy disk. The state surface water data center will be provided with a computer&#13;
package type B comprising: file saver (486dx2, EISA), five personal computers (486dx2), two laser&#13;
printers, dot matrix printer, plotter and digitizer, together with six UPSs, two air conditioners, fax&#13;
machine, photocopier and office furniture. Software provided will include: the surface water, and&#13;
water quality data systems; an appropriate hydrological package; a general purpose package and a&#13;
network package.&#13;
25.   S.taigGroundwater Data Management-System. The GWD will establish three new Regional&#13;
Offices during the project and these will be provided with computer package type D together with&#13;
groundwater data system software (para 24). The existing 22 District offices will also be provided&#13;
with computer package D. Storage of data after verification will be initiated in the district offices.&#13;
Data transfer to the Regional Offices and the state groundwater data center will be by a dial-up&#13;
NICNET connection or by floppy disk. The four laboratories at Hyderabad, Cuddapah,&#13;
Rajahmundry and Kurnool will be provided with computer package type D together with water&#13;
quality data system and general purpose software. Data stored by the laboratories will be transferred&#13;
to the groundwater data center by dial-up NICNET connection or by floppy disk. The state&#13;
groundwater data center will be provided with a computer package type B with accessories as listed&#13;
above (para 24), together with software for the groundwater and water quality data systems, an&#13;
appropriate hydrogeological package, a general purpose package and a network package.&#13;
26.   CWC Regional Office Data Management Svstern The CWC Regional Office in Hyderabad&#13;
(South Central Region) will be provided with a computer package type C comprising: two&#13;
computers (486 dx); two laser printers; one graphic plotter (A3) and two UPSs together with a&#13;
photocopier, fax machine, air conditioner and office furniture. Software provided will include: the&#13;
sutface water and water quality data systems, an appropriate hydrology package, a general purpose&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
171&#13;
Annex 20&#13;
Page 6&#13;
package and a network package. Circle and Divisional Offices of CWC in AP will be provided with&#13;
computer packages type D plus surface water, water quality and general purpose software.&#13;
27.   CGWB Regional Office Data Management System. The CGWB Regional Office in&#13;
Hyderabad will be provided with a computer package type B with accessories as listed above (para&#13;
24). The software packages to be provided include the groundwater and water quality data systems,&#13;
an appropriate hydrogeological package, a general purpose package and a network package. The&#13;
Regional Office laboratory will be provided with a computer package type D (para 24) together with&#13;
water quality data system and general purpose software. Data will be transferred from the laboratory&#13;
to the Regional Office data bank by floppy disc.&#13;
28.   Communication Systems between Data Banks. The data banks established in DOICAD and&#13;
in the CWC Regional Office for surface water data must be interactive. Similarly the data banks&#13;
established for groundwater data in GWD and the CGWB Regional Office must be directly&#13;
interactive through a communication system. As these data banks will all be located in Hyderabad,&#13;
the required level of communication could be achieved by modems with dedicated land telephone&#13;
lines through the local NICNET ground station.&#13;
29.   It will be necessary to transfer: (a) data collected by the DOICAD and CWC Regional Office&#13;
surface water data centers in Hlyderabad to CWC's central surface water data center in New Delhi,&#13;
and (b) groundwater data from the GWD and CGWB Regional Office data centers to CGWB's&#13;
central groundwater data center in Faridabad. NICNET ground stations will be provided for the data&#13;
bank in CWC headquarters, New Delhi, and for the data center in CGWB headquarters, Faridabad.&#13;
With the DOICAD and CWC Regional Office data banks connected to NICNET by dedicated land&#13;
lines, these facilities will suffice to transfer data to the CWC central bank by satellite communication.&#13;
Similarly, if GWIC and CGWB Regional Office data banks are linked to NICNET by dedicated land&#13;
line, the facilities will enable data transfer to the CGWB central data bank in Faridabad.&#13;
D. Improvements to Reservoir Instrumentation and Management&#13;
Reservoir Sedimentation Surveys&#13;
30.   AP has five major, 105 medium and numerous minor irrigation reservoirs and a number of&#13;
storage facilities are now under construction. Sedimentation of reservoirs is a matter of vital concern&#13;
to the State because surveys carried out in the past by the AP Engineering Research Laboratory&#13;
(APERL) have shown that some of the reservoirs are silting at much higher than the design rate. The&#13;
DOICAD will continue reservoir survey work under the HP, and one package of equipment will be&#13;
provided comprising: 25ft/40 HP boat with trailer, satellite trisponder position system, distomat&#13;
electronic measurer, echotrac echo sounder, general survey equipment, walkie talkie radio sets,&#13;
digital planimeters, and sediment sampling and analysis sets. One jeep and one lorry will be&#13;
provided with the equipment package, and a D type computer package will be supplied for&#13;
calculations and graphics. DOICAD will prepare a detailed program of reservoir surveys prior to&#13;
project implementation.&#13;
E. Monitoring of Return Flows&#13;
3 1.   Little quantitative data is available on return flows from large irrigation schemes to rivers and&#13;
drains. On an experimental basis, it is proposed to establish about 40 flow gauging sites on the&#13;
outfall drains from the command of the Kakatiya Canal of the Sri Ram Sagar Project (SRSP). The&#13;
aim is to assess the quantity of irrigation water returning to the rivers from the command area. A&#13;
lump sum of Rs. 1.0 million has been provided for this work and the program will be developed&#13;
during project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 20&#13;
Page 7&#13;
F. Improvements to Real-Time Water Resources Management&#13;
32.   DOICAD proposes to extend its flood warning/forecasting system by supplementing the five&#13;
existing wireless stations which have been installed for flood management by 20 additional stations.&#13;
G. Institutional Strengthening&#13;
33.   General. Institutional performance needs to be strengthened for data collection, validation,&#13;
storage and dissemination. Appropriate skills will have to be developed to operate the computing and&#13;
laboratory facilities provided under the project and to maintain the improved hydrometric networks.&#13;
A high level of inter-agency coordination will be required for development of computerized data&#13;
banks which are inter-active and accessible between data centers and can be accessed by other public&#13;
and private entities.&#13;
34.   The project would finance incremental project staff and other inputs to support new&#13;
institutional initiatives intended to implement the project and to ensure its sustainability into the&#13;
future. The inputs would include: office buildings, equipment and services; consultant services;&#13;
project specific staff training; and vehicles and their operational costs. Support for selection of&#13;
specialized equipment and computing facilities and software, and for training of state agency staff&#13;
will be provided, as appropriate, by CWC, CGWB, NIH, CWPRS, IMD and the retained&#13;
consultants of the project.&#13;
35.   Proposed Organizational Setup. For surface wayer hydrology, the existing organization for&#13;
surface water hydrological data collection and management under the CE (Investigations) will be&#13;
modified for project implementation. A Hydrology Circle under an SE will be created, incorporating&#13;
the Hydrology and Statistics Division and the surface water data center, and controlling the three&#13;
river gauging Divisions and the two laboratories (Figure 1). For groundwater hydrology, three&#13;
Regional Offices of GWD would be established under Joint Directors during the project, and these&#13;
offices will have multi-functional responsibilities for the management of the 22 existing District&#13;
Offices (para 7). The State groundwater data center would be established in Hyderabad within the&#13;
office of the Director of the GWD (Figure 2).&#13;
36.   Office Buildings and Equipment. The state surface water data center will be in the&#13;
headquarters of the surface water hydrology unit to be established in DOICAD (para 35) and to be&#13;
located in Hyderabad. A provision of Rs.4.5 million has been made in the cost estimates for a&#13;
building for the data center. The existing building of the GWD will be modified to establish a&#13;
groundwater data center.&#13;
37.   Computers for Administration and Management. As noted, (paras 24, 25), computing&#13;
facilities for data management systems will be provided in the state surface water data center, the&#13;
three divisional and 13 sub divisional offices and the laboratories of the new surface water&#13;
hydrology unit, and in the state groundwater data center, the three regional offices, the 22 district&#13;
offices and the four laboratories of GWD. Each of these offices will also be provided with general&#13;
purpose software packages, primarily for administration purposes.&#13;
38.   Vehicles. The surface water data collection and management activities would require a total&#13;
of 21 vehicles distributed as follows: 12 jeeps and one lorry for supervision and operation of the&#13;
DOICAD river gauging stations, two jeeps to be attached to the laboratories, one car for use by the&#13;
suriface water data center, and one minibus to be used for training activities. The package of reservoir&#13;
sedimentation survey equipment would include one jeep and one lorry. GWD would be provided&#13;
with a total of 29 jeeps and one saloon car to be distributed as follows: 25 jeeps for GWD's three&#13;
regional and 22 district offices, four jeeps to be attached to the four regional laboratories, and one car&#13;
for the state groundwater data center.&#13;

Training&#13;
39.   Surface Water Traininy Activities. The objectives, procedures and arrangements for training&#13;
are given in Annex 11. The following will be the main subjects of training under the project: (a)&#13;
training of stream gauging staff and junior supervisory staff in the technology of hydrometry and&#13;
maintenance of instruments and ancillary equipment; (b) training of field level staff in sampling&#13;
technology for sediment observations and in sediment analyses, and for water quality sampling and&#13;
on-site analyses; (c) training of junior professional staff of the laboratories in the use of specialized&#13;
laboratory equipment; and (d) training of professionals in the state surface water data center, in the&#13;
field hydrology divisions and subdivisions and in the laboratories in the use of computers for&#13;
hydrological data processing and for other software applications. Essentially all this training will be&#13;
carried out in-house within the hydrology unit to be established in DOICAD through appropriate&#13;
training courses, and on-the-job training. In order to implement in-house training courses, it will be&#13;
necessary to train selected staff from the unit to be trainers. The training of trainers would be&#13;
implemented with the assistance of NIH. Consultant services would be retained under the project to&#13;
provide oversight and advice on the design, context and implementation of these training activities.&#13;
40    Additional to the above described training which relates to basic data collection and data&#13;
management systems, senior professional staff of the hydrology unit will be provided with training&#13;
in analytical hydrology and advanced computer software applications through training courses run&#13;
by NIH in Roorkee, and post-graduate training in Indian universities. Study tours in India and&#13;
abroad will be provided to observe appropriate hydrometric and data management systems. The&#13;
senior professional staff of the laboratories will also be provided with advanced training. -&#13;
41.   Hydrometeorological Observation Training. The hydrometeorological observation networks&#13;
maintained by DOICAD would be improved under the project. While the expansion element of the&#13;
improvement program is limited to installation of additional 80 ARGs and eight FCSs, improvement&#13;
of the performance of the existing network would be an important activity. This will involve training&#13;
of observers in the proper performance of their duties, including maintenance of instruments. The&#13;
observers will be trained by IMD staff located at the Pune or Madras IMD Training Center. The&#13;
supervisors and more senior staff will receive training at the IMD training center in Pune.&#13;
42.   Groundwa   Training Activities. The main subjects of groundwater training under the&#13;
project will be: (a) training of GWD field staff in manual water level observations, water quality&#13;
sampling, use of field measuring equipment (biaxial electric tapes, EC meters, pH meters), and&#13;
servicing of digital automatic water level recorders; (b) training of the junior professional staff of the&#13;
laboratories in the use of specialized laboratory equipment; and (c) training of professionals in the&#13;
state groundwater data center, in the regional and district offices of GWD and in the laboratories in&#13;
the use of computer software for hydrological data processing and other software applications. This&#13;
training will be provided through the National Groundwater Training Institute to be established by&#13;
CGWB (Annex 16 of the SDV) with junior technical staff trained through courses run using&#13;
WALMI facilities. The suppliers of digital water level recorders will be required to provide training&#13;
on servicing and maintenance of the equipment. Retained consultants will provide oversight and&#13;
advice for the training programs.&#13;
43.   The above training all relates to basic data collection and data management systems. In&#13;
addition, senior professional staff of GWD will be provided with training in advanced&#13;
hydrogeological analysis techniques, including computer modelling, through training courses run by&#13;
NIH in Roorkee and post-graduate training in Indian universities. Study tours in India and abroad&#13;
will be provided to observe appropriate groundwater monitoring networks and data management&#13;
systems. The senior professional staff of the laboratories will also receive advanced training.&#13;

under DOICAD will be undertaken by GOAP. Many of the new staff posts will filled by&#13;
redeploying staff from within DOICAD. However, some specialized professional posts (chemists,&#13;
experienced computer specialists) and new gauging station staff will have to filled by new&#13;
recruitment. The estimated incremental costs of salaries and allowances for the Hydrology Unit&#13;
would be about Rs. 58.2 million over the life of the project.&#13;
46.   The existing staff for GWD will be adequate to implement most of the state groundwater&#13;
program. However, some additional staff will be required, mainly for creation of the groundwater&#13;
data center and for the laboratories, and this will entail new recruitment. It is estimated that the&#13;
annual costs of staffing and allowances for the groundwater monitoring and data management&#13;
activities under the project would be about Rs. 11.8 million over the life of the project.&#13;
47.   Hydrological Services and Interaction with Data User Agencies. A basic concept of the&#13;
project is that hydrological data collection and its management and dissemination should be regarded&#13;
as a service to the public at large, and thus that all legitimate users of the data should have clearly&#13;
defined and easily acquired access to the data. Moreover, the data collected should be made available&#13;
in formats that are useful to the users. In many cases, the publication of data summaries in the form&#13;
of year books would suffice. Groundwater data often requires interpretation in the form of maps and&#13;
explanatory reports. Some users may require the original data, and this could be provided as&#13;
printouts or on floppy discs. The possibility of payment for such services should be considered.&#13;
48.   Arranging access for interested government agencies should not present difficulties.&#13;
Provision of easy access to the data bases for legitimate private entities could be a problem. It is&#13;
proposed that a committee of interested data users should be established in the state. This would give&#13;
prominence to the availability of the data, reveal the demand for the type of data required and the&#13;
fonm of its presentation, and give direction for improvements to the hydrological service.&#13;
H. Procurement&#13;
49.   General. The procurement arrangements for the project are described in paras 4.03-4.07 and&#13;
detailed in Annex 1 3b. All procurement would follow the standard procurement documentation&#13;
approved by the World Bank for works, goods and services.&#13;
50.   Works. The works to be implemented by the surface water hydrology unit consist of&#13;
relatively small buildings and small structures for hydrological and hydrometeorological stations.&#13;
These will be implemented either by LCB contracts according to Bank guidelines or by force&#13;
account, as appropriate. The major works element under GWD will be construction of observation&#13;
tubewells, most of which will be procured by LCB contracts with local drilling companies, but the&#13;
wells with more difficult designs will be constructed with agency's own drilling rigs under force&#13;
account.&#13;
51.   Goods. Implementation of the project will involve procurement of large quantities of&#13;
specialized hydrometric equipment, some specialized survey and laboratory equipment, and&#13;
computer hardware and software. These items will be procured by ICB as described in para 4.04 of&#13;
the SAR. The office equipment will be procured by LCB or by prudent shopping procedures. The&#13;
vehicles for the first year will be procured by prudent shopping from the manufacturers according to&#13;
Government standard rate contracts. In subsequent years, vehicles will be procured by ICB or&#13;
prudent shopping procedures, according to the size of the contract package.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 20&#13;
Page 10&#13;
52.   Services. Consultant services will be procured by Central Government according to Bank&#13;
guidelines for foreign and local consultants. NIC services will be provided according to negotiated&#13;
charges and fees arranged by Central Government. All other services will be provided by the&#13;
concerned agencies through force account procedures.&#13;
I. Project Coordination. Monitoring and Evaluation and Review&#13;
53.   Project Coordination. A small Project Coordination Group will be established in DOICAD,&#13;
reporting to the Secretary of the Department, to coordinate project activities implemented by the&#13;
surface water hydrology unit and by the GWD (SAR, paras 5.18, 5.20). An important function of&#13;
the group will be liaison with the central and local offices of CWC, CGWB and IMD and other&#13;
agencies which are implementing project programs in the state. The Project Coordination Group will&#13;
also have the responsibility for project monitoring and evaluation and for project annual reviews as&#13;
described below.&#13;
54.   Monitoring and Evaluation. The monitoring and evaluation of this structurally complex&#13;
project in AP will be carried out by the State Project Coordination Group in DOICAD (para 53). The&#13;
exercise will cover both project implementation progress and the performance of the data collection&#13;
and management systems developed. The results of monitoring and evaluation will be reported in&#13;
semi annual progress reports (para 55).&#13;
55.   Project Reviews. Semi-annual progress reports will be prepared for the state by the State&#13;
Project Coordination Group and submitted to the Central Project Coordinating Secretariat for&#13;
inclusion in the project semi-annual progress reports. An annual implementation review of the&#13;
project will be undertakenunder the guidance of the Central Coordinating Committee with the Bank&#13;
not later than December 31 each year. The annual review arrangement will provide the flexibility&#13;
required to amend the state program for the following fiscal year to reflect performance in the past&#13;
year, and to incorporate any lessons learned into the future program. The State Coordinating Group&#13;
will have responsibility for presentation of information on the performance of AP's part of the&#13;
program for the annual implementation review.&#13;

INDIA&#13;
HYDROLOGYPRO&#13;
Programs in Gujarat&#13;
I.    Gujarat has a land area of some 195,890 km2 with a population estimated at about 34 million in&#13;
1989. Mean annual rainfall ranges from less than 200 mm in the extreme northwest to about 1,270 mm&#13;
in the south, almost all of which occurs with the southwest monsoon during June to September. The&#13;
state contains the lower catchments of several westward flowing rivers, of which the Narmada, Tapi,&#13;
Mahi and Sabarmati flow to the Arabian Sea, and the Bana and Sarawathi to the Little Rann of Kutch.&#13;
The Saurashtra peninsula lies entirely within Gujarat and is radially drained by numerous small rivers.&#13;
2.    Section A of this Annex describes existing systems for hydrological observations and data&#13;
management; Section B summarizes proposed improvements to the observation systems; Section C&#13;
covers reservoir sedimentation surveys; Section D describes the establishment of interactive computerized&#13;
data banks and inter-bank communication systems; Section E covers institutional strengthening activities;&#13;
Section F refers to procurement procedures; and Section G describes arrangements for project&#13;
performance monitoring and evaluation, and for the project review process. Detailed cost estimates for&#13;
state agency activities are shown by Table 1.&#13;
A. Existing Systems for Hydrological Observations and Data Management&#13;
Surface Water Hydrology&#13;
3.    Organizational Setup. The Narmada and Water Resources Department (NWRD) has overall&#13;
responsibility for surface water hydrology. Hydrological operations at field and office levels are carried&#13;
by a Division within the Water Resources Investigations Circle (WRIC) of NWRD. The Hydrology&#13;
Division which has a headquarters at Ahmedabad, has five Subdivisions, each with several Section&#13;
Offices for field operations. CWC's activities in Gujarat are managed by a Division with a headquarters&#13;
in Ahmedabad.&#13;
4.    River Gauging Stations. The Hydrology Division operates 173 river gauging stations of which&#13;
19 measure only stage level and the remaining 154 measure both stage and discharge. Suspended&#13;
sediment is also measured at 143 of the stage/discharge stations. Water quality is not routinely&#13;
monitored. The CWC operates 29 river gauging stations in Gujarat, of which 13 record only the stage&#13;
level and 16 provide both stage and discharge measurements. Water quality is monitored at seven of the&#13;
CWC stage/discharge stations, and suspended sediment is measured at six of these sites.&#13;
5.    Laboratory Facilities. As water quality is not monitored by the Hydrology Division as a routine,&#13;
WRIC does not have its own laboratory facilities. The Gujarat Engineering Research Institute (GERI) is&#13;
a large R&amp;D agency under NWRD. It has a small laboratory facility which can provide services to&#13;
organizations within the department. The water samples collected by CWC for quality monitoring are&#13;
analyzed at its divisional laboratory in Ahmedabad.&#13;
6.    DatjProcessing and_Management. Discharge measurements at NWRD sites are obtained by full&#13;
time crews. The crew overseer computes the measurements which are then checked by the Junior&#13;
Engineer during site visits. The gauge readings and discharge measurements are submitted in a&#13;
prescribed format upwards through the hierarchy with further checks to the Divisional Office where data&#13;
are finalized, tabulated and published in the form of year books. Computers are not used for managing&#13;
the data. Data collected from CWC observation sites are processed and stored according to standard&#13;
procedures (Annex 15).&#13;
Groundwater Hydrology&#13;
7.    Organizational Setup. The Ground Water Investigation Circle (GWIC) of the Gujarat Water&#13;
Resources Development Corporation (GWRDC) is the organization responsible for all aspects of ground&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
184                               Annex 21&#13;
Page 2&#13;
water hydrology. GWIC has a headquarters in Gandhinagar and has Regional Offices in Ahmedabad,&#13;
Rajkot, Bhavnagar and Palanpur, each of which control three to five of the 17 Sub-regional offices. The&#13;
Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) has a Regional Office in Ahmedabad with responsibilities for the&#13;
geographical area of Gujarat state.&#13;
8.    GroundwateLMonitoring Networks. GWIC maintains a network of 2,656 observation wells.&#13;
These comprise: (a) 719 open wells tapping the phreatic aquifer and distributed in all the districts of the&#13;
state; (b) 1,394 open wells in the coastal region of southern Saurashtra which is subject to sea water&#13;
intrusion of the phreatic aquifer, (c) 325 tubewells tapping deeper confined or semi-confined aquifers,&#13;
mainly in mainland Gujarat; and (d) 218 purpose-built piezometers in the Narmada command area in&#13;
mainland Gujarat and Sauirashtra. Excepting the Narmada command area piezometers, water levels are&#13;
measured in the observation wells manually immediately prior to and immediately after the monsoon.&#13;
Autographic water level recovers have been installed on 26 of the Narmada command area piezometers&#13;
and the remaining 192 wells are measured manually four times each year. The CGWB Regional Office&#13;
maintains a network of 1,007 observation wells, of which 850 are shallow open wells and 157 are&#13;
tubewells. Water levels are monitor by manual measurements in January, May, August and November&#13;
of each year.&#13;
9.    GWIC samples its main network of open wells for water quality analyses at the end of the dry&#13;
season and post monsoon each year. The salinity observation network along the Saurashtra coast is&#13;
monitored for water quality more frequently. Samples are taken from all CGWB Regional Office open&#13;
well observation points for water quality analyses in May each year.&#13;
10.   Laboratory Facilities. GWIC has established laboratories in three of its regional offices in&#13;
Ahmedabad, Bhavnagar and Rajkot. The CGWB Regional Office has a laboratory facility in Ahmedabad.&#13;
All the laboratories are intended to carry out the standard chemical analyses associated with assessment of&#13;
water quality for irrigation. The laboratories require major upgrading in terms of buildings and equipment&#13;
(para 18).&#13;
11.   Data Processine and Management. GWIC's groundwater data is processed manually and most is&#13;
stored in paper files, but part of the water level record has been entered into the CGWB computer files.&#13;
The CGWB Regional Office has some computing facilities and groundwater software but, to date, only&#13;
the historical water level data has been stored in computer files.&#13;
Hydrometeorology&#13;
12.   Organizational Setup. As with all the states of India, several state agencies in Gujarat maintain&#13;
networks of rainfall observation stations, including the Revenue Department (RD), the NWRD and the&#13;
Department of Agriculture (DOA). The last two departments also have established networks of climate&#13;
observation stations. In addition, the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD) has a small network of&#13;
rainfall and climate stations in Gujarat, and CWC manages a small rainfall observation network.&#13;
13.   Hydrometeorological Networks. The NRWD and other state agencies make rainfall and other&#13;
climatic observations at 972 sites in Gujarat, outside the Narmada Basin. Of the 972 stations, 300 are&#13;
full climate stations (FCS) and five are automatic weather stations (AWS), 249 are rainfall stations&#13;
equipped with autographic rain gauges (ARG), and 418 have standard rain gauges (SRG). It is reported&#13;
that a large proportion of the equipment on FCS sites is unserviceable. The IMD maintains 12 FCSs, 15&#13;
ARG stations with and one SRG station. CWC has 10 rainfall stations of which nine are equipped with&#13;
ARGs and one with an SRG. The average density of rainfall observation sites in Gujarat is about one&#13;
rain gauge/194 km2.&#13;
14.   Data Processing and Management. Computers are not used for storage and management of the&#13;
rainfall and other climate data collected by the NRWD and other state agencies in Gujarat. The IMD&#13;
processes data from its own network and from selected state agency rainfall stations using computers at&#13;
its Pune headquarters.&#13;
&#13;

B. Improvements to Hydrological Observations Systems&#13;
Surface Water Hydrology&#13;
15.   Upgrading of Data Collection Infrastructure. The surface water observation network&#13;
improvement program in Gujarat does not involve expansion of either the NWRD or the CWC networks.&#13;
In fact, two NWRD observation sites which duplicate CWC sites will be deleted. When this is&#13;
implemented, the NWRD network will consist of 171 stations and the CWC network remains at 29&#13;
stations. However, provision is made for upgrading equipment at NWRD observation sites to broaden&#13;
the range of parameters observed, and for additional office and site buildings. The proposed&#13;
improvements to the NWRD river observation network include:&#13;
(a)   provision of 30 propeller-type current meter packages including echo sounders,&#13;
digital counters and camp equipment;&#13;
(b)   provision of 160 cup type current meter sets;&#13;
(c)   provision of 77 bed load sampling equipment sets;&#13;
(d)   provision 20 sets of silt analysis equipment; and&#13;
(e)   construction of site equipment stores at 98 river gauging sites.&#13;
16.   Laboratory Facilities. The project will construct and equip a Level II+, laboratory at&#13;
Gandhinagar. A new Level II laboratory will be constructed and equipped at Rajkot. In addition, 20&#13;
Level I laboratories will be equipped. Details of the equipment to be provided and the analyses to be&#13;
carried out by each type of laboratory are discussed in Annex 5.&#13;
Groundwater Hydrology&#13;
17.   Upgrading of Data Collection Infrastructure. The GWIC network of observation wells will&#13;
increase from 2,656 locations that are monitored at present to 2,834 locations after completion of the&#13;
project. The improved network will comprise 362 tubewells equipped with digital water level recorders,&#13;
547 tubewells which will be manually measured, and 1,925 open wells which will be manually&#13;
measured. The CGWB Regional Office observation network will increase from the present 1,007 wells&#13;
to 1,1 17 after completion of the project. The network will include 140 tubewells equipped with digital&#13;
water level recorders, 221 tubewells which will be manually measured, and 756 open wells which will&#13;
be manually measured. Details of the improvements to be provided to the State network are given in&#13;
Table 2. Annex 4 describes of groundwater network improvements.&#13;
18.  Improved Laboratory Facilities. The project will upgrade the facilities at the existing GWIC&#13;
laboratories at Bhavnagar and Rajkot and a new facility will be created at Gandhinagar. The laboratories&#13;
will be provided with new buildings. The Gandhinagar facility will be provided with equipment to Level&#13;
II+ laboratory standard. The Bhavnagar and Rajkot laboratories will be provided with equipment to Level&#13;
II standard. The CGWB Regional Office laboratory at Ahmedabad will be provided with Level II+&#13;
laboratory equipment. Details of the equipment to be provided and the analyses to be performed by each&#13;
type of laboratory are discussed in Annex 5.&#13;
19.   TypBasin Water Balance Studies. GWIC plans to carry out water balance studies in ten small&#13;
basins selected to be typical of the various hydrogeological conditions in the state. The basins will be&#13;
equipped with rain gauges, other climate observation equipment for Penman evaporation estimates, run-&#13;
off measuring devices and soil moisture tensiometers. A shallow observation tubewell with a digital&#13;
water level recorder will be located in each basin.&#13;
Hydrometeorology&#13;
20.  lrnprovements              Network. The existing NWRD network would not be expanded&#13;
but since a number of the existing rainfall and climatic stations need replacement of missing or defective&#13;
meteorological instruments, a lumpsum provision of Rs.3.0 million has been made for such&#13;
replacements.&#13;
&#13;

C. Reservoir Sedimentation Surveys&#13;
21.   Reservoir sedimentation surveys are included under the project because the work is given high&#13;
priority by concerned central and state agencies. To facilitate this work, the project would provide&#13;
NWRD with two sets of specialized survey equipment each comprising: 25ft/40HP boat with trailer,&#13;
satellite trisponder position system, distomat electronic measurer, echotrac echosounder, general survey&#13;
equipment, walkie talkie radio sets, digital planimeters, and sediment sampling and analysis sets. One&#13;
jeep and one lorry would be provided for the set and a D type computer package will be supplied for&#13;
calculations and graphics.&#13;
D. Improvements to Data Management and Communication Systems&#13;
Upgrading of Data Management Systems&#13;
22.   General. Separate state data centers would be established for surface water and for groundwater&#13;
information. The surface water data center would be managed by a new hydrology entity to be created&#13;
within NWRD, the headquarters of which would be located at Gandhinagar. The unit would be under an&#13;
officer of Superintending Engineer (SE) rank and would incorporate the Hydrology Division now located&#13;
in WRIC (para 2). The state groundwater data center would be established as a special unit within&#13;
GWIC and would be located in Gandhinagar. The CWC's stream gauging and hydrometeorological&#13;
observation networks in Gujarat are managed by the Division located in Ahmedabad (para 3) which&#13;
would become a local data center. The CGWB Regional Office in Ahmedabad (para 4) would establish a&#13;
data center for information collected from its observation network. The data management systems of the&#13;
four agencies would be fully computerized with software designed so that the data bases could be&#13;
interactive. Reference should be made to Annex 7 for more detailed discussion of data management and&#13;
data transfer systems.&#13;
23.   Checking anILEntry of Historical Data into Computer Storage. This section refers mainly to&#13;
surface water flow data which has been collected by the Hydrology Division of WRIC. All the data is&#13;
now on paper files. Although at least part of this data may be of doubtful quality, it must be recognized&#13;
that it is, at present, all that is available. Therefore, the existing data series must be stored for use until&#13;
such time that a long series of higher validity becomes available. Nevertheless, some validation of the&#13;
data must be made to remove obvious anomalous observations before data are entered into computer&#13;
storage or, altematively, a computer routine could be used to recognize possible anomalies after the data&#13;
are entered. It is evident that this exercise will be very subjective and will require care in application. The&#13;
next opportunity to review the historical data will be offered when a validated data series is developed&#13;
through project activities at a stable site where a secure rating curve can be derived. If comparison of the&#13;
rating curve with historical stage/discharge measurements reveals a 'systematic error' in the discharge&#13;
measurements, it may then be possible to 'correct' the data series for the site.&#13;
24.   State Surface Water Data Management System. The data collected from the NWRD observation&#13;
stations are first accumulated in the Subdivisional Offices of the Hydrology Division after collection from&#13;
the observation sites by the concerned Section Offices. The five Subdivisions and the Division would be&#13;
provided with computer package type D comprising: two personal computers (486 sx) and two dot&#13;
matrix printers, plus UPSs, associated office furniture and an air conditioner, together with surface water&#13;
data system and general purpose software. Data will be verified and entered into computer storage at the&#13;
Subdivision. Transfer of data to the Circle Office and surface water data center will be by a dial-up&#13;
NICNET linkage or by floppy disk. The two surface water quality laboratories (para 16) will be provided&#13;
with computer package type D with water quality data system and general purpose software. Transfer of&#13;
data from the laboratories to the surface water data center will be by dial-up NICNET linkage or by&#13;
floppy disk. The state surface water data center will be provided with a computer package type B&#13;
comprising: file saver (486dx2, EISA), five personal computers (486dx2), two laser printers, dot matrix&#13;
printer, plotter and digitizer, together with six UPSs, a generator, two air conditioners, fax machine,&#13;
photocopier and office furniture. Software provided will include: the surface water and water quality&#13;
data systems; an appropriate hydrological package; a general purpose package; and a network package.&#13;
&#13;

25.   State Groundwater Data Management System. The GWIC Regional Offices in Ahmedabad,&#13;
Rajkot, Bhavnagar and Palanpur (para 6) will be provided with computer package type D plus software&#13;
for the groundwater data system and general administrative management. Storage of data after&#13;
verification will be initiated in the Regional Offices. Data transfer to the state groundwater data center&#13;
will by dial-up NICNET linkage or by floppy disk. The laboratories at Gandhinagar, Bhavnagar and&#13;
Rajkot (para 18) will be provided with computer package type D together with water quality data system&#13;
and general purpose software. Data stored by the laboratories will be transferred to the state groundwater&#13;
data center by dial-up NICNET connection or by floppy disk. The groundwater data center will be&#13;
provided with a computer package type B with accessories as listed above (para 24), together with&#13;
software for the groundwater and water quality data systems, an appropriate hydrogeological package&#13;
and a network package.&#13;
26.   CWC Divisional Office Data Management System. The CWC Divisional Office in Ahmedabad&#13;
will be provided with a computer package type D (para 24). Software provided will include: the surface&#13;
water and water quality data systems, an appropriate hydrology package, a network package, and a&#13;
general purpose package. The Divisional Office will be provided with a modem and dedicated land line&#13;
linkage to the local NICNET groundstation for transfer of data to its Regional Office data bank in&#13;
Hyderabad.&#13;
27.   CGWB Regional Office Data Management System. The CGWB Regional Office in Ahmedabad&#13;
will be provided with a computer package type B with accessories as listed above (para 24). The&#13;
software packages to be provided include groundwater and water quality data systems, an appropriate&#13;
hydrogeological package, a general purpose package, and a network package. The Regional Office&#13;
laboratory will be provided with a computer package type D together with water quality data system and&#13;
general purpose software. Data will be transferred from the laboratory to the Regional Office data bank&#13;
by floppy disk.&#13;
28.   Communication Systems between Data Banks. The data banks established in NWRD Hydrology&#13;
Unit (Gandhinagar) and in the CWC Regional Office (Hyderabad) for surface water data must be&#13;
interactive through satellite communication. Similarly the data banks established for groundwater data in&#13;
GWIC and the CGWB Regional Office must be interactive through a communication system.&#13;
29.   It will be necessary to transfer surface water data collected at the State data center in Gandhinagar&#13;
and at the CWC regional data bank in Hyderabad to CWC's central surface water data bank in New&#13;
Delhi, and to transfer ground water data from the GWIC and the CGWB Regional Office data centers to&#13;
CGWB's central groundwater data bank in Faridabad. NICNET ground stations will be provided for the&#13;
central surface water data bank in CWC headquarters, New Delhi, and for the central groundwater data&#13;
bank in CGWB headquarters, Faridabad. With the NWRD and CWC Regional Office data banks&#13;
connected by dedicated land lines to their local NICNET stations, these would suffice to transfer data to&#13;
the CWC central bank. Similarly, if GWIC and CGWB Regional Office data banks are linked by land&#13;
line to the Ahmedabad NICNET station, this would enable data transfer to the CGWB central data bank&#13;
in Faridabad.&#13;
E. Institutional Strengthening&#13;
30.   General. Institutional performance needs to be strengthened for data collection, validation,&#13;
storage and dissemination. Appropriate skills will have to be developed to operate the computing and&#13;
laboratory facilities provided under the project and to maintain the improved hydrometric networks. A&#13;
high level of inter-agency coordination will be necessary for development of computerized data banks&#13;
which are inter-active and accessible between data centers and can be accessed by other public and private&#13;
entities.&#13;
31.   The project would finance incremental project staff and other inputs to support new institutional&#13;
initiatives intended to implement the project and to ensure its sustainability into the future. The latter&#13;
would include: office buildings, equipment and services; consultant services, project specific staff&#13;
training; and vehicles and their operational costs. In addition, support for selection of specialized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
188                                  Annex 21&#13;
Page 6&#13;
equipment, computing facilities and software selection, and for training of state agency staff will be&#13;
provided, as appropriate, by CWC, CGWB, NIH. CWPRS, IMD and the retained consultants of the&#13;
project.&#13;
32.   Office Buildings and Eguipment. The state surface water data center will be in the headquarters&#13;
of the newly established Hydrological Directorate to be located in Gandhinagar. This will require an&#13;
office facility, which will be constructed and fturnished under the project. Provision is also made for&#13;
construction of and furnishings for five Subdivisional offices and 20 Section Offices for the Hydrology&#13;
Division. Furnishings will be provided for the Directorate office, and for one divisional, five sub-&#13;
divisional and 20 section offices. The GWIC will establish a groundwater data center in a building in&#13;
Gandhinagar which will be constructed and furnished under the project.&#13;
33.   Computers for Administration and Management. As noted, computing facilities for water data&#13;
management systems will be provided in the state surtface water data center, in the circle and divisional&#13;
offices, and in the five sub divisional offices of the Hydrology Directorate in the two surface water&#13;
quality laboratories (para 23). Similarly. computers will be provided in the state groundwater data center,&#13;
in the four regional offices of GWIC, and the three GWIC laboratories (para 24). The computer packages&#13;
provided at each location will include a general purpose software package for administration and&#13;
management purposes.&#13;
34.   Vehicles. The suriface water data collection and management activities would require a total of 14&#13;
vehicles distributed as follows: eight jeeps for supervision of the river gauging stations, two jeeps to be&#13;
attached to the laboratories, one saloon car for use by the Director and by the suiface water data center,&#13;
and one minibus to be used for training activities. As noted (para 21). the packages for reservoir&#13;
sedimentation surveys would each include one jeep and one IOITY. CWIC would be provided with a total&#13;
of 27 vehicles distributed as follows: 24 jeeps for use by the Regional and Subregional Offices, two&#13;
jeeps to be attached to the Rajkot and Bhavnagar laboratories, and one car for the GWIC headquarters.&#13;
Training - State Agencies (Annex I 1)&#13;
35.   Surface Water Training Activities. The followinig will be the main subjects of training under the&#13;
project: (a) training of stream gauging staff and junlior supelvisory staff in the technology of hydrometry&#13;
and maintenance of instruments and ancillary equipment; (b) training of field level staff in sampling&#13;
technology for sediment observations and in sediment analyses: (c) training of field level staff in water&#13;
quality sampling and on-site analyses; (d) training of junior professional staff of the laboratories in the&#13;
use of specialized laboratory equipment; and (e) training of professionals in the state surface water data&#13;
center, in the field hydrology division and subdivisions and in the laboratories in the use of computers&#13;
for hydrological data processing and for other software applications. Essentially all this training will be&#13;
carried out in-house within the Hydrology Directorate to be established in NWRD through appropriate&#13;
training courses, and on-the-job training. In order to implement in-house training courses, it will be&#13;
necessary to train selected staff from the Directorate to be trainers. The training of trainers would be&#13;
implemented with the assistance of NIH and CWC. Consultant services would be retained under the&#13;
project to provide oversight and advice on the design, context and implementation of these training&#13;
activities. Additional to the above described training which relates to basic data collection and data&#13;
management systems, senior professional staff of the Hydrology Directorate will be provided with&#13;
training in analytical hydrology and advanced computer software applications through training courses&#13;
run by NIH in Roorkee and post-graduate training in Indian universities. Study tours in India and abroad&#13;
will be provided to observe appropriate hydrometric and data management systems. Senior professionals&#13;
from the laboratories will also be provided with advanced training in India and with study tours abroad.&#13;
36.   Hydrometeorological Observation Training. The hydrometeorological observation networks&#13;
maintained by NWRD would be improved under the project. While the network will not be expanded,&#13;
improvement of the performance of the existing network would be an important activity. This will&#13;
involve training of observers in the proper performance of their duties, including maintenance of&#13;
instruments. Observers, supervisors and more senior staff will be trained at the IMD training center in&#13;
Pune.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1 8t&#13;
Annex 21&#13;
Page 7&#13;
37.   Groundwater Training Activities. The main subjects of groundwater training under the project&#13;
will be: (a) training of GWIC field staff in manual water level observations, water quality sampling, use&#13;
of field measuring equipment (biaxial electric tapes, EC meters, pH meters), and servicing of digital&#13;
water level recorders; (b) training of the junior professional staff of the laboratories in the use of&#13;
specialized laboratory equipment: and (c) training of professionals in the state groundwater data center, in&#13;
the Regional Offices of GWIC and in the laboratories in the use of computer software for hydrological&#13;
data processing and other software applications. The more advanced training will be provided at CGWB&#13;
Headquarters in Faridabad and later through the National Groundwater Research and Training Institute to&#13;
be established at Raipur (Annex 16 of the SDV). Junior technical staff will be trained through courses&#13;
run using WALMI facilities. The suppliers of digital water level recorders will be required to provide&#13;
training on servicing and maintenance of the equipment. Retained consultants will provide oversight and&#13;
advice for the training programs.&#13;
38.   The above training all relates to basic data collection and data management systems. In addition,&#13;
senior professional staff of GWIC will be provided with training in advanced hydrogeological analysis&#13;
techniques, including computer modeling, through training courses run by NIH in Roorkee and post-&#13;
graduate training in Indian universities. Study tours in India and abroad will be provided to observe&#13;
appropriate groundwater monitoring networks and data management systems. Advanced training will&#13;
also be provided to senior professionals from the laboratories in Indian institutions and through study&#13;
tours abroad.&#13;
39.   Training Cost Estimates. Quantities, cost estimates and timing for training activities are shown by&#13;
Table 1.&#13;
40.   Staffing Requirements and Costs. The establishment of a Hydrology Directorate in NWRD will&#13;
involve the creation of the equivalent of a small circle incorporating the existing Hydrology Division, the&#13;
new laboratories, and the newly created surface water data center. Many of the new staff posts will be&#13;
filled by re-deployment from within NWRD. However, some specialized professional posts (chemists,&#13;
experienced computer specialists) will have to filled by new recruitment. The estimated incremental costs&#13;
of salaries and allowances for the Hydrology Directorate would total about Rs.58.0 million over the life&#13;
of the project, averaging about Rs.9.9 million/yr.&#13;
41.   The existing staff for GWIC will be adequate to implement most of the state groundwater&#13;
program. However, some additional staff will be required, mainly for creation of the groundwater data&#13;
center and for the laboratories, and this will entail new recruitment. It is estimated that the incremental&#13;
costs of salaries and allowances for the groundwater monitoring and data management activities under the&#13;
project would be about Rs. 18.0 million over the life of the project, averaging about Rs.3.0 million/yr.&#13;
42.   Hydrological Services and Interaction with Data User Agencies. A basic concept of the project is&#13;
that hydrological data collection and its management and dissemination should be regarded as a service to&#13;
the public at large. Thus, all legitimate users should have clearly defined and easily acquired access to the&#13;
data.  Moreover, the data collected should be made available in formats that are useful to the users. In&#13;
many cases, the publication of data summaries in the form of year books would suffice. Groundwater&#13;
data often requires interpretation in the form of maps and explanatory reports. Some users may require&#13;
the original data, and this could be provided as printouts or on floppy disks. The possibility of payment&#13;
for such services should be considered.&#13;
43.   Arranging access for interested government agencies should not present difficulties. Provision of&#13;
easy access to the data bases for legitimate private entities could be a problem. It is proposed that a&#13;
committee of interested data users should be established in the state. This would give prominence to the&#13;
availability of the data, reveal the demand for the type of data required and the form of its presentation,&#13;
and give direction for improvements to the hydrological service.&#13;

F. Procurement&#13;
44.   General. The procurement arrangements for the project are described in paras 4.03-4.07 and&#13;
detailed in Annex 13b. All procurement would follow the standard procurement documentation approved&#13;
by the World Bank for works, goods and services.&#13;
45.   Works. The works to be implemented by the Hydrology Directorate consist of relatively small&#13;
buildings and small structures for hydrological and hydrometeorological stations. These will be&#13;
implemented by LCB contracts according to Bank guidelines or by force account, as appropriate. The&#13;
major works element under GWIC will be construction of observation tubewells, most of which will be&#13;
procured by LCB contracts with local drilling companies, but the wells with more difficult designs will&#13;
be constructed with agency's own drilling rigs under force account.&#13;
46.   Goods. Implementation of the project will involve procurement of large quantities of specialized&#13;
hydrometric equipment, some specialized survey and laboratory equipment, and computer hardware and&#13;
software. These items will be procured centrally by ICB as described in para 4.04 of the SAR. The&#13;
office equipment will be procured by LCB or by prudent shopping procedures. The vehicles for the first&#13;
year will be procured by prudent shopping from the manufacturers according to Government standard&#13;
rate contracts. Procurement in subsequent years will be by ICB or prudent shopping procedures&#13;
according to the size of the package.&#13;
47.   Services. Consultant services will be procured by Central Government according to Bank&#13;
guidelines for foreign and local consultants. NICNET services will be provided according to negotiated&#13;
charges and fees arranged by Central Govemment. All other services will be provided by the concerned&#13;
agencies through force account procedures.&#13;
0. Proiect Coordination. Monitoring and Evaluation and Review&#13;
48.   Project Coordination. A small Project Coordination Group will be established in the NWRD,&#13;
reporting to the Secretary of the Department, to coordinate project activities implemented by the&#13;
Hydrology Directorate and by the GWIC (SAR, paras 518, 520). An important function of the group&#13;
will be liaison with the central offices of CWC, CGWB and IMD and their offices in Gujarat and with&#13;
other agencies which are also involved in project programs in the State (NIH and CWPRs). The Project&#13;
Coordination Group will also have the responsibility for project monitoring and evaluation and for the&#13;
project annual reviews as described below.&#13;
49.   Monitoring and Evaluation. The monitoring and evaluation of this structurally complex project in&#13;
Gujarat will be carried out by the State Project Coordination Group in NWRD (para 48). The exercise&#13;
will cover both project implem. entation progress and the performance of the data collection and&#13;
management systems developed. The results of monitoring and evaluation will be reported in semi-&#13;
annual reports and form a basis for the annual implementation reviews (para 50).&#13;
50.   Proiect Annual Reviews. Semi-annual progress reports will be prepared for the state by the State&#13;
Project Coordination Group and submitted to the Central Project Coordinating Secretariat for inclusion in&#13;
the project semi-annual progress reports. An annual implementation review of the project will be&#13;
undertakenunder the guidance of the Central Coordinating Committee with the Bank not later than&#13;
December 31 each year. The annual review arrangement will provide the flexibility required to amend the&#13;
state program for the following tiscal year to reflect performance in the past year, and to incorporate any&#13;
lessons leamed into the future program. The State Coordinating Group will have responsibility for&#13;
presentation of information on the performance ot Gujarat's part of the program for the annual&#13;
implementation review.&#13;

Introduction&#13;
I .    Madhya Pradesh (MP) is the largest state in India with a land area of 443,450 km2. Its&#13;
population in 1989 was 52.5 million. The mean annual rainfall varies from about 1,600 mm in the&#13;
south-eastern part of the state to about 600 mm in the northwest. Many of the major rivers of central&#13;
India originate in MP. The major river systems of the state are the Chambal, Betwa and Son,&#13;
tributaries of the Ganges, and the Narmada, Tapi, Mahanadi, Godavari and Mahi. The Ganges Basin&#13;
and Narmada basin areas within MP are not included under HP for surface water related project&#13;
components. The remaining basins occupy about 151,000 km2 within MP or about 34% of the state&#13;
area. The entire area of MP is included under HP for groundwater related project components.&#13;
2.    Section A of this Annex describes existing systems for hydrological observations and data&#13;
management; Section B summarizes proposed improvements to the data collection systems; Section C&#13;
describes the establishment of interactive computerized data banks and inter-bank communication&#13;
systems; Section D covers institutional strengthening activities; Section E refers to cost estimates and&#13;
procurement procedures; and Section F describes arrangements for project performance monitoring&#13;
and evaluation, and for project review. Detailed cost estimates for state agency activities are shown by&#13;
Table 1.&#13;
A. Existin2 Systems for Hydrological Data Collection and Data Management&#13;
Surface Water Hydrology&#13;
3 .   Organizational Set-Up. The responsibility for surface water hydrology will be placed under&#13;
a Chief Engineer who will control both surface water and groundwater hydrology and report to the&#13;
Engineer-in-Chief. The Directorate of Hydrometeorology was established in 1982 under the World&#13;
Bank assisted MP Major Irrigation Project (Cr. 1177) for hydrological data collection and&#13;
processing. The Directorate contained four field data collection Divisions, located at Raipur, Rewa,&#13;
Bhopal and Hoshangabad. Subsequently, the Government of Madhya Pradesh (GOMP) decided to&#13;
hand over all river gauging stations in the Narmada Basin area in the state to the Narmada Valley&#13;
Development Authority (NVDA). One Subdivision of the Hoshangabad Division has been&#13;
transferred and the remaining two Subdivisions together with the Division are to be transferred to&#13;
the NVDA. The CWC has four Divisional Offices with responsibility for project river basins in MP&#13;
(Annex 15 of the SDV).&#13;
4.   River Gauging Network. The WRD currently operates 61 gauging stations on project rivers,&#13;
of which 59 measure stage and discharge and two observe stage, discharge and sediment load. The&#13;
CWC network in MP consists of 12 stage/discharge stations and 16 stations where stage,&#13;
discharge, sediment and water quality are observed.&#13;
5.   Laboratory Facilities. The WRD has not carried out water quality monitoring and has no&#13;
chemical laboratory facilities. The CWC has laboratory facilities in its Divisions responsible for&#13;
monitoring basin systems in MP.&#13;
6.   Data Processing and Management. Stage and discharge measurements are obtained by&#13;
full-time crews of WRD. The discharge is measured twice a day except on Sundays or holidays.&#13;
The crew leader submits observations on standard forms about once a week to Section Officers,&#13;
who check the work before forwarding them to the Subdivision. After scrutiny by the Assistant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
199&#13;
Annex 22&#13;
Page 2&#13;
Engineer, single copies of the completed forms are submitted to the Divisional Office where about&#13;
20% of the data are spot checked. At the end of the water year (1st June to 31st May), the finalized&#13;
record of daily mean discharges for the year, along with the computed 10 day means and the&#13;
maximum and minimum daily mean values for each month are sent to the Director,&#13;
Hydrometeorology in Bhopal for compilation and publication in water year books. The Directorate&#13;
does not use computer facilities for processing, storage and retrieval of data. The CWC follows its&#13;
standard procedures for collection and processing of data for the Commission's network in MP&#13;
(Annex 15 of the SDV).&#13;
Hydrometeorology&#13;
7.   Organizational Set-Up. In common with all the states of India, several state and central&#13;
agencies in MP maintain networks of rain gauge stations and climatic stations, including the&#13;
Department of Agriculture, the Department of Lands and the WRD. IMD and CWC also maintain&#13;
hydrometeorological networks in MP. The meteorological stations operated by WRD have been&#13;
established to IMD standards and they are being periodically checked by IMD inspectors.&#13;
8.   Meteorological Network. The total network in MP comprises 419 stations with standard rain&#13;
gauges (SRG), 60 stations with autographic rain gauges (ARG) and 31 climatic stations. The&#13;
WRD maintains 116 SRGs and three ARGs. CWC has installed 71 SRGs and 44 ARGs. The&#13;
IMD owned network comprises 36 SRGs, 13 ARGs and 13 full climatic stations (FCS). The&#13;
distribution pa..ttern of observation stations indicates that some additional rain gauges in the&#13;
Mahanadi and Godavari river basins would improve the adequacy of the network.&#13;
Groundwater Hydrology&#13;
9.   Organizational_Set-Up. The state organization responsible for survey, investigation and&#13;
monitoring of groundwater resources is the Ground Water Survey Circle (GWSC) which is headed&#13;
by a Superintending Geologist who comes under the office of the Chief Engineer (para 3). The&#13;
headquarters of the GWSC is in Bhopal, and there are nine Divisional offices which each control&#13;
four to six of the 43 Subdivisions. The CGWB has a Regional Office in Bhopal and a Unit Office&#13;
in Raipur.&#13;
10.  Groundwater Monitoring Network. The GWSC has established a network of 4,450&#13;
observation wells distributed through the 45 districts of the state. All the observation points are&#13;
open wells tapping the phreatic aquifer systems. The wells re not the property of WRD. Until&#13;
1993, water levels were measured manually three times each year (January, May and November),&#13;
but GWSC now follows the CGWB practice of four measurements each year in January, May,&#13;
August and November. The GWSC network has not been monitored systematically for water&#13;
chemical quality. The CGWB Regional Office maintains a network of 1,372 observation wells in&#13;
MP, all of which are open wells which are not owned by the Board. Water levels are monitored by&#13;
manual measurements during fixed ten day periods four times each year (January, May, August,&#13;
November). Water samples are taken from the observation wells for chemical analysis in May each&#13;
year. Both the CGWB and GWSC networks have growing problems with their open well&#13;
observation points - some wells go dry during the dry season while others are abandoned and fal1&#13;
into disrepair. There is therefore a need to replace such observation points by purpose-built&#13;
tubewells.&#13;
I I.  Laboratory Facilities. The GWSC maintains four chemical laboratories at Bhopal, Gwalior,&#13;
Sagar and Jabalpur. Chemical analyses are confined to 13 parameters relating mainly to the use of&#13;
groundwater for irrigation. The buildings and laboratory equipment are primitive. The CGWB&#13;
Regional Office has established a water quality laboratory at its Bhopal headquarters, though much&#13;
of the equipment is antiquated.&#13;

12.  Data Processing and Management. Data are processed at GWSC Divisional Offices from&#13;
where they are transmitted to the Bhopal headquarters for preparing annual water table fluctuation&#13;
maps for each of the 45 districts in the state. At present, all data processing is done manually. The&#13;
CGWB Regional Office in Bhopal has one desk top computer and a limited number of programs&#13;
for data management.The Regional Office has entered its entire groundwater data base into&#13;
computer files. The Raipur unit office of CGWB has no computer facilities. Data transfer to&#13;
CGWB Headquarters in Faridabad is by posting floppy discs.&#13;

Surface Water Hydrology&#13;
13.   Upgrading of Data Collection Infrastructure. The proposed upgrading of the WRD river&#13;
gauging network will entail completion of the program originally planned under the Bank-assisted&#13;
MP Major Irrigation Project (para 3) by establishing 42 new gauging stations in the Godavari,&#13;
Tapti, Mahi and Mahanadi basins. The new stations will include 27 sites where stage/discharge&#13;
measurements are made and 15 sites where stage, discharge, sediment and water quality are&#13;
observed. The project will also upgrade 69 existing gauging stations. The equipment to be provided&#13;
includes: (a) 42 AWLR; (b) 11 propeller type current meter packages; (c) 122 cup type current&#13;
meter packages; (d) 15 cableways for use with boats; (e) 15 cableways for use with cradles or&#13;
winches; (f) 38 bridge sets; (g) 25 boat outfits without trailer; (h) one moving boat outfit; and (i) 15&#13;
sediment sampling packages. In addition, the project will provide 15 sediment analysis laboratory&#13;
buildings which will also function as Level I laboratories and 42 site equipment stores. The CWC&#13;
does not envisage any expansion of its network in the state but sites will be upgraded.&#13;
14.   Improved Laboratory Facilities. Under the HP, groundwater and surface water hydrology&#13;
will be managed under a single organization under a Chief Engineer in the WRD. Therefore, the&#13;
laboratory facilities will serve for monitoring both surface water and groundwater. The existing&#13;
four laboratories at Bhopal, Gwalior, Sagar and Jabalpur now under GWSC (para 11) will be&#13;
increased by five new laboratories to be established at Rewa, Bilaspur, Raipur, Balaghat and&#13;
Khandwa (sanction, including staff sanction has been obtained for four of these). Of these nine&#13;
laboratories, seven would be of Level II standard while the Bhopal and Raipur facilities would be&#13;
Level II+ laboratories. New buildings will be provided for all nine laboratories. The project will&#13;
also provide 15 Level I laboratories which will be located at the river gauging sites where sediment&#13;
and water quality are to be monitored. The CWC Divisional Office laboratories which serve basins&#13;
in MP will be upgraded to Level II. Details of the equipment to be provided and the analyses to be&#13;
carried out by each type of laboratory are discussed in Annex 5.&#13;
Groundwater Hydrology&#13;
15.   Upgrading of Data Collection Infrastructure. The GWSC network of observation wells will&#13;
increase from 4,450 to 4,715 locations after completion of the project. The improved network will&#13;
comprise 565 tubewells equipped with digital water level recorders, 100 tubewells which will be&#13;
manually measured and 4,050 open wells which will be manually measured. The CGWB Regional&#13;
Office observation network will increase from a present 1,372 to 1,488 wells after project&#13;
completion. The network will include 265 tubewells equipped with digital water level recorders, 30&#13;
tubewells which will be manually measured and 1,193 open wells which will be manually&#13;
measured. Details of the improvements to the GWSC network are given in Table 3. For a more&#13;
detailed discussion on groundwater network improvements, reference should be made to Annex 4.&#13;
16.   Improved Laboratory Facilities. Since the State facilities will jointly serve both surface&#13;
water and groundwater, provisions under the HP have been quantified in para 14 above. The&#13;
CGWB laboratory at Bhopal will be upgraded to Level H+.&#13;

17.   Improvements to the Meteorological Network. WRD will improve/expand its rain gauge&#13;
network through installation of 44 SRGs and 36 ARGs. Since a number of the existing&#13;
observation stations have defective or missing meteorological instruments, a lump sum provision&#13;
has been made for such replacements. The CWC will not expand its network in MP, but&#13;
improvements are provided for the existing network (Annex 15, SDV).&#13;
C. Improvements to Data Management and Communication Systems&#13;
Upgrading of Data Management Systems&#13;
18.  General. The collection and management of surface water and groundwater data in MP will&#13;
be managed by a single unit under the Chief Engineer. However, separate computer facilities will&#13;
be provided for management of surface water and groundwater data at the water data center(s) to be&#13;
established in Bhopal. CWC's stream gauging networks on the Mahanadi, Godavari, Narmada&#13;
and Tapi rivers in MP are managed from a Regional office in Hyderabad with Circle and Divisional&#13;
offices distributed at various localities. The Hyderabad Regional Office will be the main data center&#13;
for exchange of information with the state. The CGWB Regional Office in Bhopal will establish a&#13;
data center for information collected from its observation network. Reference should be made to&#13;
Annex 7 for more detailed discussion of the data management and transfer systems.&#13;
19.  Checking and Entry of Historical Data in Computer Storage. This section refers mainly to&#13;
surface water flow data. All of the state data is now on paper files, and some may be of doubtful&#13;
quality. However, it must be recognized that this data is all that is available at present and it must&#13;
be stored until a long series of higher validity becomes available. Nevertheless, some validation of&#13;
the data must be made to remove obvious anomalies, and this exercise will be very subjective and&#13;
will require care in application. The next opportunity to review the historical data will be offered&#13;
when a validated series is developed with a secure rating curve through project activities. If&#13;
comparison of the rating curve with historical stage/discharge measurements reveals a 'systematic&#13;
elnor' in the discharge measurements, it may then be possible to correct the data series for the site.&#13;
20.  State Surface Water Data Management System. The surface water data will accumulate at the&#13;
Bhopal, Raipur, Jagdalpur and Rewa Divisional Offices where most of the verification and final&#13;
processing will be carried out (para 29). These offices and their Circle Office at Bhopal will be&#13;
provided with computer package type D comprising two PCs (486 sx), two dot matrix printers&#13;
plus UPS's, associated office furniture and an air conditioner, together with surface water data&#13;
system and general purpose software. Transfer of data to the Circle Office and the water data&#13;
center will be by a dial-up NICNET linkage or by floppy disk. The water data center will be&#13;
provided with a computer package type B for management of surface water data. The package will&#13;
comprise: a file saver (486 dx2, EISA), five PCs (486 dx2), two laser printers, a dot matrix&#13;
printer, a plotter and a digitizer, together with a generator, two air conditioners, a fax machine,&#13;
photocopier and office furniture. Software provided will include: the surface water and water&#13;
quality data systems, a hydrological package, a general purpose package, and a network package.&#13;
The nine laboratories will be provided with D type computer packages plus water quality and&#13;
general purpose software. Transfer of data from the laboratories to the water data center will be by&#13;
a dial-up NICNET connection or by floppy disk.&#13;
21.  Seiroundwater Data Management Systems. The groundwater data collected by WRD&#13;
accumulates from 43 Subdivisional Offices into nine Divisional Offices. The latter will be provided&#13;
with computer packages type D plus groundwater data system and general purpose software. The&#13;
two circle offices of the groundwater organization (para 29) will also be provided with computer&#13;
package type D with groundwater data, water quality data and general purpose software. The water&#13;
data center will be provided with computer package type B together with groundwater data, water&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
202&#13;
Annex 22&#13;
Page 5&#13;
quality data and general purpose software. As noted (para 22) the nine laboratories will be&#13;
provided with computer packages type D and appropriate software. Transfer of data from the&#13;
Divisional Offices and the laboratories to the Circle Offices and the water data center will be by a&#13;
dial-up NICNET linkage or by floppy disk.&#13;
22.  CWC Data Management Systems. The CWC Divisional offices and Circle offices concerned&#13;
with collecting surface water data in the Mahanadi, Godavari and Tapi basins in Madhya Pradesh&#13;
will be provided with type D computer packages plus surface water data and general purpose&#13;
software. They will transfer data collected from gauging stations to their Regional Office in&#13;
Hyderabad by dial-up NICNET linkages or by floppy disk. The Regional Office will be provided&#13;
with a computer package C together with surface water data, water quality data and general&#13;
purpose software. The Regional Office will be the main location of interaction with the MP water&#13;
data center.&#13;
23. CGWB Regional Office Data Management System. The CGWB Regional Office in Bhopal&#13;
will be provided with computer package type B together with groundwater data, water quality data&#13;
and general purpose software. Its laboratory at Bhopal and the Unit Office in Raipur will be&#13;
provided with computer packages type D together with appropriate software. Transfer of&#13;
information from the unit office to the Regional Office data bank will be by a dial-up NICNET&#13;
connection or by floppy disk.&#13;
24. IMD Data Management System. The IMD Meteorological Center in Bhopal will be provided&#13;
with a computer package type C and appropriate software for management of the rainfall and&#13;
climatic data generated by CWC and WRD in MP. Transfer of this data from the state water data&#13;
center to the IMD center will be by floppy disk.&#13;
Communication Systems between Data Banks&#13;
25.  The surface water data banks established in WRD and in the CWC Regional Office must be&#13;
interactive and the communication system provided must allow each entity access to the other&#13;
party's data base on a 'read only' basis. Similarly, the groundwater data banks in WRD and the&#13;
CGWB Regional Office must be directly interactive through a communication system. And the&#13;
state data banks for groundwater and surface water would be required to communicate with the&#13;
national data banks for groundwater at Faridabad and for surface water at New Delhi. CGWB,&#13;
Faridabad, and CWC, New Delhi, will be provided with dedicated NICNET ground stations. The&#13;
state water data center and the CGWB and CWC regional office data centers will be provided with&#13;
modems and dedicated land telephone lines to their local NICNET ground stations. With these&#13;
facilities in place, all parties would be able to communicate and transfer data through the NICNET&#13;
system.&#13;
E. Institutional Strengthening&#13;
26.  General. Institutional performance needs to be strengthened for data collection, validation,&#13;
storage and dissemination. Appropriate skills will have to be developed to operate the computing&#13;
and laboratory facilities provided under the project and to maintain the improved hydrometric&#13;
networks. A high level of inter-agency coordination will be required for development of&#13;
computerized data banks which are inter-active and accessible between data centers and can be&#13;
accessed by other public and private entities.&#13;
27.  The project would finance incremental staff and other inputs to support new institutional&#13;
initiatives intended to implement the project and to ensure its sustainability into the future. These&#13;
would include: office buildings; equipment and services; consultant services; project specific staff&#13;
training; and vehicles and their operational costs. Support for selection of specialized equipment,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
203&#13;
Annex 22&#13;
Page 6&#13;
computing facilities and software, and for training of state agency staff will be provided, as&#13;
appropriate, by CWC, CGWB, NIH, CWPRS, IMD and the consultants of the project.&#13;
28.  Organizational LSet U. GOMP have decided to merge the activities associated with&#13;
collection and management of surface and groundwater data within a single organization under a&#13;
CE, who will report to the Engineer-in-Chief, WRD. An SE will be in charge of the data centers.&#13;
Groundwater field operations will be carried out by two Circles which will control the nine&#13;
Divisional Offices and the 43 Subdivisions. The third Circle will control four surface water&#13;
hydrology field Divisions. A Senior Chemist at the Bhopal laboratory will administer the nine&#13;
Level II+ or II laboratories. The organizational set up is shown by Figure 1.&#13;
29.  Office Building and Equipment. A state water data center will be established in Bhopal.&#13;
Provisions are made under the project for modifying existing office space at headquarters to house&#13;
the data centers. Provisions are also made for modifying office space at Divisional and Circle&#13;
Offices to house the computers to be provided at these localities.&#13;
30.  Computers for Administration and Management. As noted previously, all the computing&#13;
facilities provided for surface water and groundwater data management (paras 21, 22) will include&#13;
general purpose software packages. These are intended primarily for administrative and office&#13;
management purposes.&#13;
3 1.  Vehiclbs. 'The state water data center will be provided with four saloon cars and a car will be&#13;
provided for the CE. The field Divisions for suiface water data collection will require 10 jeeps. The&#13;
two Circle Offices, nine Divisional Offices and 43 Sub-divisional Offices responsible for&#13;
groundwater monitoring will be provided with a total 54 jeeps (with replacement of 50% of the&#13;
vehicles in the year six of the project). Each of the nine laboratories intended to serve for analyses&#13;
of groundwater and surtface water samples will be provided with a jeep. A minibus will be&#13;
provided for training activities.&#13;
33.  Staffing Requirements and Costs. So far as possible, staffing of the new organization&#13;
established for surface water and groundwater data collection and management will be achieved by&#13;
re-deployment. However, implementation of the project will demand significant additional staff to&#13;
cteate new divisions and Circle offices, to man new gauging sites, for the additional vehicles, and&#13;
for specialist posts in the data center and laboratories. The estimated cost of incremental staff over&#13;
the life of the project totals about Rs. 81.0 million, of which about 53% is for surface water&#13;
activities, 30% for groundwater activities, and 17% for water quality activities. The average annual&#13;
cost for incremental staff is around Rs. 13.5 million.&#13;
Training (Annex I 1)&#13;
34.  Surface Water Training Activities. The following will be the main subjects of training under&#13;
the project: (a) training of stream gauging staff and junior supervisory staff in hydrometry and&#13;
maintenance of instruments and ancillary equipment; (b) training of field level staff in sampling&#13;
technology for sediment observations and in sediment analysis and for water quality sampling and&#13;
on-site analyses; (c) training of junior professional staff of the laboratories in the use of specialized&#13;
laboratory equipment; and (d) training of professionals in the state water data center in the use of&#13;
computers for hydrological data processing and for other software applications. Essentially all this&#13;
training will be carried out in-house within the WRD through appropriate training courses, and&#13;
on-the-job training. In order to implement in-house training courses, it will be necessary to train&#13;
selected staff to become trainers. The training of trainers would be implemented with the assistance&#13;
of NIH, CWC and CWPRS. The WALMI at Bhopal will become the principal facility for this&#13;
training activity. Consultant services would be retained under the project to provide oversight and&#13;
advice on the design, context and implementation of these training activities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
204&#13;
Annex 22&#13;
Page 7&#13;
35.  Additional to the above described training which relates to basic data collection and data&#13;
management systems, senior professional staff of the surface water hydrology unit will be&#13;
provided with training in analytical hydrology and advanced computer software applications&#13;
through training courses run by NIH in Roorkee, by post-graduate training in Indian universities,&#13;
and by study tours in India and abroad to observe appropriate hydrometric and data management&#13;
systems.&#13;
36.  Hydrometeorological Observation Training. The hydrometeorological observation networks&#13;
maintained by WRD would be improved under the project. While the expansion element of the&#13;
improvement program is limited, improvement of the performance of the existing network would&#13;
be an important activity. This will involve training of observers in the proper performance of their&#13;
duties, including maintenance of instruments. The training will be provided by IMD staff at the&#13;
Pune or Calcutta IMD Training Centers. Training of supervisors for WRD meteorological stations&#13;
and more advanced training in hydrometeorology will be provided at the IMD training center in&#13;
Pune.&#13;
37.  Groundwater Training Activities. The main subjects of groundwater training under the&#13;
project will be: (a) training of field staff in manual water level observations, water quality&#13;
sampling, use of field measuring equipment (biaxial electric tapes, EC meters, pH meters, etc.),&#13;
and servicing of digital water level recorders; and (b) training of groundwater professionals in the&#13;
state water data centre, and in the groundwater Circles and Divisions in the use of computer&#13;
software for data processing and other software applications. The training will be provided through&#13;
the National Groundwater Training Institute to be established by CGWB in Raipur, with more&#13;
junior staff trained through courses run using WALMI facilities. The suppliers of digital water&#13;
level recorders will be required to provide training on servicing and maintenance of the equipment.&#13;
Project consultants will provide oversight and advice for the training programs.&#13;
38.  The above training all relates to basic data collection and data management systems. In&#13;
addition, senior professional staff of the groundwater unit will be provided with training in&#13;
advanced hydrogeological analysis techniques, including computer modelling, through training&#13;
courses run by NIH in Roorkee. and post-graduate training in Indian universities. Study tours in&#13;
India and abroad will be provided to observe appropriate groundwater monitoring networks and&#13;
data management systems.&#13;
39.  Training Cost Estimates. Quantities, cost estimates and timing for all training activities are&#13;
shown by Table 1.&#13;
Hydrological Services and Interaction with Data User Agencies&#13;
40.  A basic concept of the project is that hydrological data collection and its management and&#13;
dissemination should be regarded as a service to the public at large. Thus, all legitimate users of the&#13;
data should have clearly defined and easily acquired access to the data. Moreover, the data collected&#13;
should be made available in formats that are useful to the users. In many cases, the publication of&#13;
data summaries in the form of year books would suffice. Groundwater data often requires&#13;
interpretation in the form of maps and explanatory reports. Some users may require the original&#13;
data, and this could be provided as printouts or on floppy discs. The possibility of payment for&#13;
such services should be considered.&#13;
41.  Arranging access for interested government agencies should not present difficulties.&#13;
Provision of easy access to the data bases for legitimate private entities could be a problem. It is&#13;
proposed that a committee of interested data users should be established in the state. This would&#13;
give prominence to the availability of the data, reveal the demand for the type of data required and&#13;
the format of its presentation, and give direction for improvements to the hydrological services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

F. Procurement&#13;
42.  General. The procurement arrangements for the project are described in paras 4.03-4.07&#13;
and detailed in Annex 13b.   All procurement would follow  the standard procurement&#13;
documentation approved by the World Bank for works, goods and services.&#13;
43.  Works. The civil works to be implemented by the WRD consists of relatively small&#13;
buildings and small structures for hydrological and climatic stations. These will be implemented by&#13;
LCB contracts according to Bank guidelines or force account, as appropriate. The drilling works&#13;
under the project will be construction of observation tubewells, most of which will be procured by&#13;
LCB contracts with local drilling companies, but the wells with more difficult designs will be&#13;
constructed using the government's own drilling rigs under force account.&#13;
44.  Goods . Implementation of the project will involve procurement of large quantities of&#13;
specialized hydrometric equipment, some specialized survey and laboratory equipment, and&#13;
computer hardware and software. These items will be procured centrally by ICB as described in&#13;
para 4.0 of the SAR. The office equipment will be procured by LCB or by prudent shopping&#13;
procedures. The vehicles for the first year will be procured by prudent shopping from the&#13;
manufacturers according to Government standard rate contracts. Subsequent vehicle procurement&#13;
will follow ICB or prudent shopping procedures, according to the size of the package.&#13;
45.  Services. Consultant services will be procured by Central Government according to Bank&#13;
guidelines for foreign and local consultants. NICNET services will be provided according to&#13;
negotiated charges and fees arranged by Central Government. All other services will be provided&#13;
by the concerned agencies through force account procedures.&#13;
G. Project Coordination. Monitofing and Evaluation &amp; Review&#13;
46.  Proiect Coordination. A small Project Coordination Group will be established in WRD,&#13;
reporting to the Secretary of the Department, to coordinate all project activities. An important&#13;
function of the group will be liaison with the Divisional, Regional and Central Offices of CWC&#13;
with the Regional and Central Offices of CGWB, and with other agencies (IMD, NIH, CWPRS)&#13;
which are involved in project programs in the state. The Project Coordination Group will also have&#13;
the responsibility for project monitoring and evaluation, and for the project reviews as described&#13;
below.&#13;
47.  Monitofing-and-Evaluation. The monitoring and evaluation of this structurally complex&#13;
project will be carried out in MP by the State Project Coordination Group. The exercise will cover&#13;
both project implementation progress, and the performance of the data collection and management&#13;
systems developed. The results of monitoring and evaluation will be reported in semi-annual&#13;
reports and form a basis for the annual implementation reviews (para 48).&#13;
48.  Project Annual Reviews. Semi-annual progress reports will be prepared for the state by the&#13;
State Project Coordination Group and submitted to the Central Project Coordinating Secretariat for&#13;
inclusion in the project semi-annual progress reports. An annual implementation review of the&#13;
project will be undertakenunder the guidance of the Central Coordinating Committee with the Bank&#13;
not later than December 31 each year. The annual review arrangement will provide the flexibility&#13;
required to amend the state program for the following fiscal year to reflect performance in the past&#13;
year, and to incorporate any lessons learned into the future program. The State Coordinating&#13;
Group will have responsibility for presentation of information on the performance of MP's part of&#13;
the program for the annual implementation review.&#13;

Programs in Maharashtra&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    Maharashtra has a land area of 308,000 km2 and the population was about 62.8 million in&#13;
1989. There are three rainfall zones. The Western Ghats, with a relatively high annual rainfall of&#13;
between 1,000-3,000 mm, run parallel to the coast and serve as a barrier to the advancing&#13;
southwest monsoon. East of the Ghats is the rain shadow region where mean annual precipitation&#13;
drops below 500 mm and which is chronically drought prone. Further to the east, the rain shadow&#13;
effect decreases and mean annual rainfall increases to 1,000 to 2,500 mm. The Godavari and&#13;
Krishna, which rise in the mountain range of the Westem Ghats and flow eastwards into the Bay&#13;
of Bengal, are the major river systems. A large number of small rivers drain to the coastal plain&#13;
west of the Ghats into the Arabian Sea. The Tapi river in the north drains part of Maharashtra into&#13;
the Arabian Sea.&#13;
2.    Section A of the report describes existing systems for hydrological observations and data&#13;
management; Section B summarizes proposed improvements to the data collection systems; Section&#13;
C describes the establishment of interactive computerized data banks and inter-bank communication&#13;
systems; Section D covers monitoring of return glows; Section E is concerned with real-time water&#13;
resources management; Section F describes support for reservoir instrumentation and management;&#13;
Section G covers institutional strengthening activities; Section H refers to procurement procedures;&#13;
and Section I describes arrangements for project performance monitoring and evaluation, and for&#13;
project review. Detailed cost estimates for state agency activities are shown by Table 1.&#13;
A. Existing Systems for Hvdrological Data Collection and Data Management&#13;
Surface Water Hydrology&#13;
3.    Organizational Set Up. All surface water hydrology is presently the responsibility of the&#13;
Chief Engineer Water Resources (CEWR) under the Secretary Irrigation. The hydrological field&#13;
data is collected and regularly published through four divisional offices for respective basins.&#13;
Hydrological analysis is carried out by the Hydrology Cell at Nasik.&#13;
4.    River Gauging Network. The Maharashtra Irrigation Department (MID) maintains 139&#13;
river gauging stations where river stage and discharge are monitored (a further 114 gauging&#13;
stations are under construction). At 55 of the sites, discharge is measured by current meter, and at&#13;
the remaining 84 sites, discharge is measured by the float method. Sediment load observations are&#13;
made at one stage/discharge station, and both sediment and water quality are observed at 15&#13;
stations. The CWC operates 62 river gauges in Maharashtra, of which 24 also observe both quality&#13;
and sediment and six observe quality.&#13;
5.    Laboratory Facilities. MID operates one laboratory at Nasik which is about Level II&#13;
standard, but most of the equipment requires upgrading. CWC has laboratory facilities with its&#13;
Divisional Offices.&#13;
6.    Data Processing and Management. River flow observations are obtained by full-time&#13;
crews, reinforced by temporary staff hired during the monsoon season. Measurements are&#13;
checked by the Junior Engineer during site visits. Data are submitted in a prescribed fornat with&#13;
further checks to the Sub-divisional and thence to basin Divisional Offices where data are tabulated&#13;
for publication as yearbooks. Computerization of this process started in 1984 at the Pune&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Divisional Office, but in the three remaining Divisional Offices, data processing is still carried out&#13;
manually.&#13;
Groundwater Hydrology&#13;
7.    Organizational Set Up. The State's Groundwater Surveys and Development Agency&#13;
(GSDA), set up in 1972, is a Directorate under the Rural Development Department (RDD) and has&#13;
broad responsibilities for all aspects of groundwater development in Maharashtra, including rural&#13;
water supply. GSDA's headquarters is in Pune, and it operates through six Regional Offices&#13;
(Pune, Kokan, Nasik, Aurangabad, Amravati and Nagpur) which, in turn, control four to seven&#13;
District Offices, out of a total of 29 District Offices. The CGWB regional office located in Nagpur&#13;
has responsibility for the Board's activities in Maharashtra. It maintains a unit office in Pune.&#13;
8.    Groundwater Monitoring Network.  The GSDA's groundwater observation and&#13;
assessment system is based on 1,503 defined watershed areas (ranging in size from 80 km2 to 160&#13;
km2) located within the 15 river basins which together cover the surface of the State. The&#13;
observation well network now totals 3,920 points with two to three observation locations in each&#13;
watershed area, located to give bottom catchment and side slope hydrographs. The network is&#13;
based entirely on open wells in the phreatic aquifers. Water level measurements are made manually&#13;
four times each year (October, January, March, May) at all observation points, and observations&#13;
may be extended monthly into the monsoon in selected areas during times of drought. Samples are&#13;
taken for water quality analysis once each year immediately prior to the monsoon. The CGWB&#13;
Regional Office monitors 1,453 wells for water level fluctuations and water quality. The network&#13;
is entirely restricted to observation of the phreatic aquifer systems. Water level observations are&#13;
made manually during fixed 10 day intervals four time each year (January, May, August,&#13;
November). Water quality aamples are taken from all observation points in May each year.&#13;
9.    Laboratory Facilities. GSDA is operating five regional water quality laboratories at Nasik,&#13;
Kokan Bhavan, Aurangabad, Amravati and Nagpur and a central laboratory at Pune. Chemical&#13;
analyses currently include 21 parameters (one of which is coliform) and concentrate particularly on&#13;
the suitability of groundwater for drinking purposes. The laboratories require major upgrading in&#13;
terms of equipment, buildings and staffing. The CGWB Regional Office at Nagpur maintains a&#13;
laboratory at about Level II standard, though most of the equipment requires replacement.&#13;
10.   Dam-Management. The entire GSDA groundwater database is on computer files in the&#13;
Pune headquarters. The groundwater data (including water quality data) is entered into computers&#13;
at the Regional Offices and is then transferred up to the Central Office on floppy discs. The&#13;
CGWB Regional Office, Nagpur, has in-house computer capability for storage, retrieval and&#13;
analysis of groundwater data. Data transfer to CGWB headquarters is by floppy disc.&#13;
Hdrmeterology&#13;
11.   OrganizationaLSetuJ. In common with all the States of India, several State and Central&#13;
agencies in Maharashtra maintain networks of rain gauge stations, including the Revenue&#13;
Departmnent (RD), MID, IMD and CWC.&#13;
12.   The MID operates 648 standard rain gauges (SRG), 547 autographic rain gauges (ARG)&#13;
and 113 full climatic stations (FCS). The RD has installed 333 SRGs. The IMD is operating a&#13;
network of 14 ARGs and 14 FCSs, and the CWC maintains 15 SRG rainfall stations.&#13;

13.   Upgrading of Data Collection Infrastructure. The MID intends to accelerate an ongoing&#13;
program of strengthening and expanding the State's river gauging network. When this is&#13;
implemented the MID network will consist of about 294 stations. CWC network will remain at 62&#13;
stations. However some MID and CWS stations are known to duplicate which may lead to a&#13;
closure of up to seven stations after review of the MID network during project implementation.&#13;
14.   The proposed improvement to the MID river gauging network will include the&#13;
establishment of 41 new stations, provision of equipment for completing 114 stations currently&#13;
under construction, and for upgrading of existing stations. The main equipment items to be&#13;
provided include: (a) 62 chart type autographic water level recorders; (b) five propeller type&#13;
current meter packages; (c) 20 cup type current meter packages; (d) 51 cableways with winch and&#13;
cradle (for river widths of 300 to 400 m); (e) two boat outfits - 25 ftl40 HP - without trailers; (f)&#13;
five suspended sediment sampling packages; and (g) equipment for 20 silt analysis laboratories. In&#13;
addition, the project would construct site equipment stores at 41 sites and residential buildings at&#13;
274 sites.&#13;
15.   Upgrading of Laboratory Facilities. The project will support: provision of a new building&#13;
and Level II equipment for the existing laboratory at Nasik; provision of a building and equipment&#13;
for a new Level II laboratory at Pune; and provision of equipment for 21 Level I laboratories. The&#13;
CWC Divisional Office laboratories will be upgraded to Level II. Details of the laboratory&#13;
equipment to be provided and the analyses to be carried out in each type of laboratory are described&#13;
in Annex 5.&#13;
Groundwater Hydrology&#13;
16.   Upgrading of Data Collection Infrastructure. The GSDA network of observation wells will&#13;
increase from 3,920 to 4,120 locations after completion of the project. The 200 new observation&#13;
points will monitor confined or semi-confined aquifers. In addition, 500 existing shallow open&#13;
wells will be replaced by shallow borewells. All 700 borewells in the network will be equipped&#13;
with digital water level recorders. The CGWB Regional Office observation network will increase&#13;
from a present 1,453 wells to 1,503 after completion of the project. Of these 1,353 will be&#13;
manually measured while 150 wells will be equipped with digital water level recorders. Details of&#13;
the improvements to the State networks are given in Table 2. The groundwater network&#13;
improvements are described in more detail in Annex 5.&#13;
17.  Improved Laboratory Facilities. The project will strengthen GSDA's six laboratory&#13;
facilities. The laboratories at Aurangabad, Nagpur and Nasik, will be provided with buildings.&#13;
The laboratories at Aurangabad, Nagpur, Nasik, Kokan and Amravati be upgraded to Level II&#13;
standard. The central laboratory at Pune will be upgraded to Level II+ standard. The CGWB&#13;
Regional Office laboratory at Nagpur will be provided with Level II+ laboratory equipment.&#13;
Details of the laboratory equipment to be provided and the analyses to be performed are discussed&#13;
in Annex 5.&#13;
18.   Groundwater Recharge Studies. The project will support GSDA's ongoing recharge&#13;
studies at eight locations through provision of one soil moisture tensiometer and one shallow&#13;
tubewell with digital water level recorder in each of the locations.&#13;
Improvements to Hydrometeorological Observation Networks&#13;
19.   The project will support the improvement to the MID hydrometeorology network through&#13;
the provision of 18 new full climatic stations (FCS) and upgrading of nine existing FCSs through&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
214&#13;
Annex 23&#13;
Page 4&#13;
provision of nine sunshine recorders. The project also provides a lump sum allowance for spare&#13;
parts for all network instruments.&#13;
C. Improvements to Data Management and Communication Systems&#13;
Upgrading of Data Management Systems&#13;
20.   General. Separate state data centers would be established for surface water and for&#13;
groundwater information. The surface water data center would be managed by a new entity to be&#13;
created within MID and to be located in Nasik. The unit would be under a Director of&#13;
Superintending Engineer (SE) rank. It would incorporate the four existing hydrology divisions, a&#13;
newly created division located at Nagpur, and the hydrology cell now at Nasik. The state&#13;
groundwater data center would be established as a special unit within GSDA. It would be headed&#13;
by a Deputy Director who would also be responsible for all groundwater monitoring programs&#13;
within the state. The CWC's stream gauging and hydrometeorological observation networks in&#13;
Maharashtra are managed by a Circle located in Nagpur, which comes under the South Central&#13;
Regional Office where a data center will be created. The CGWB Regional Office in Nagpur would&#13;
establish a data center for information collected from its observation network. The data&#13;
management systems of the four agencies would be fully computerized with software designed so&#13;
that the data bases could be interactive. Reference should be made to Annex 7 for more detailed&#13;
discussion of data management and data transfer systems.&#13;
21.   Checkin vandEntry of Historical Data into Computer Storage. This section refers mainly&#13;
to historical surface water flow data collected by MID which is mainly in paper files or year books&#13;
(para 6). Although part of this data may be of doubtful quality, it is all that is presently available&#13;
and it must be stored until long series of higher validity become available. Nevertheless, some&#13;
validation of the data must be made to remove obvious anomalies before entry into computer&#13;
storage. This exercise will be very subjective and require care in application. The next opportunity&#13;
to review the historical data will be offered when a validated data series is developed through&#13;
project activities at a site where a secure rating curve can be derived. If comparison of the rating&#13;
curve with historical stage/discharge measurements reveals a 'systematic error' in the discharge&#13;
measurements, it may then be possible to 'correct' the data series for the site.&#13;
22.   State Surface Water Data Management System. The data collected from the MID river&#13;
gauging stations are registered at site. Once a month, daily data sheets and abstracts made of these&#13;
are passed to the Subdivisional Offices where the data is checked before it is passed on to its&#13;
Divisional Office. The project would provide the five Divisional Offices with computer package D,&#13;
comprising: two personal computers (486 sx) and two dot matrix printers, plus UPSs, associated&#13;
office furniture and an air conditioner, together with surface water data and general purpose&#13;
software. The Divisional Offices will transfer their data to the State surface water data center by&#13;
dial-up NICNET connection or by floppy disk. The two surface water quality laboratories will be&#13;
provided with computer package type D with water quality data system and general purpose&#13;
software. Transfer of data from the laboratories to the surface water data center will be by dial-up&#13;
NICNET connection or by floppy disk. The surface water data center will be provided with a&#13;
computer package type B comprising: file saver (486dx2, EISA), five personal computers&#13;
(486dx2), two laser printers, one dot matrix printer, one plotter and one digitizer, together with six&#13;
UPSs, two air conditioners, a fax machine, a photocopier and office furniture. Software provided&#13;
will include: the surface water and water quality data systems; an appropriate hydrological package;&#13;
a general purpose package; and a network package.&#13;
23.   State Groundwater Data Management System. The state ground water data bank will be&#13;
established in GSDA Headquarters, Pune, where a Type B computer facility plus accessories will&#13;
be provided. The software will include: the groundwater and water quality data systems, a&#13;
specialized hydrogeological package, a general purpose package and a network package.&#13;
Computer packages type D with accessories and groundwater data system and general purpose&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
215&#13;
Annex 23&#13;
Page 5&#13;
software will be provided for the six Regional Offices and the 17 District Offices of GSDA which&#13;
will collect groundwater data. The six laboratories of GSDA will be provided with computer&#13;
package Type D with water quality system and general purpose software. Transfer of data from&#13;
the Regional and District Offices and from the laboratories to the state groundwater data center will&#13;
be by a dial-up NICNET linkage or by floppy disk.&#13;
24.   CWC Data Management System. The CWC  Divisional Office in Pune and the Circle&#13;
Office in Nagpur will be equipped with type D computer packages with surface water data and&#13;
water quality data systems plus general purpose software. They will transmit data to their regional&#13;
data center at Hyderabad by a dial-up NICNET linkage or by floppy disk.&#13;
25.   CGWB Regional Office Data Management System. The CGWB Regional Office in&#13;
Nagpur will be provided with a type B computer package plus software for GW and water quality&#13;
data systems, an appropriate hydrogeological package, a general purpose package and a network&#13;
package in order to function as a data center for information collected from the Boards networks in&#13;
Maharashtra. The Unit Office in Pune will be provided with a D type computer package plus&#13;
software for the groundwater data system and for general purposes. The Regional Office&#13;
laboratory in Nagpur will also be provided with a D type computer package pls software for the&#13;
water quality data system and for general purposes. Transfer of data from the unit office and the&#13;
laboratory to the Nagpur data center will be by a dial-up NICNET linkage or by floppy disk.&#13;
Communication Systems between Data Banks&#13;
26.   The data banks established in MID and in the CWC Regional Office for surface water data&#13;
must be interactive through a communication system. Similarly the data banks established for&#13;
groundwater data in GSDA and the CGWB Regional Office must be directly interactive through a&#13;
communication system. The MID data bank in Nasik and the CWC Regional Office bank in&#13;
Hyderabad will be provided with a dedicated telephone line to NICNET. These will be used to&#13;
exchange information between the State and Regional office banks and with the CWC central&#13;
suiface water data center in New Delhi. The CGWB Regional Office in Nagpur and the GSDA in&#13;
Pune will be provided with NICNET connections through dedicated land lines to their local&#13;
groundstation. With these facilities, they will be able to exchange data and also transmit&#13;
information to the central groundwater data bank at CGWB headquarters, Faridabad.&#13;
D. Monitoring of Retum Flows&#13;
27.   The project would support the instrumentation of eight selected irrigation command areas&#13;
for monitoring return flows. The facilities provided would include: 16 measuring weirs with staff&#13;
gauges; 16 measuring notches with staff gauges; 16 flumes with staff gauges; and 14&#13;
stage/discharge stations with AWLR; and 14 standard current meter sets.&#13;
E. Real-Time Water Resources Management&#13;
28.   The MID has established a network of 99 river flow observation stations equipped with&#13;
wireless sets for flood forecasting purposes. The project would support provision of wireless&#13;
equipment for an additional 40 observation sites.&#13;
F. Improvements to Reservoir Instrumentation and Management&#13;
Reservoir Instrumentation&#13;
29.   This component is intended to improve the data on inflows, storage and outflows of&#13;
reservoirs. Provision is made for installation of 70 AWLRs and for calibrating 50 hydraulic&#13;
structures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
216&#13;
Annex 23&#13;

Reservoir Sedimentation Surveys&#13;
30.   This work is contracted out with the Maharashtra Engineering Research Institute. MID will&#13;
be provided with one set of specialized equipment for reservoir sedimentation surveys and&#13;
provision is made for funding the operating costs for five years. The equipment will include: 25&#13;
ft/40 HP boat with trailer; satellite trisponder position system; distomat electronic measurer;&#13;
echotrac echosounder; general survey equipment; walkie talkie radio sets; digital planimeters; and&#13;
sediment sampling and analysis kits. A D type computer package will be provided for calculations&#13;
and graphics. One jeep and one lorry wiHl be provided for the set.&#13;
G. Institutional Strengthening&#13;
General&#13;
3 1.   Institutional performance needs to be strengthened for data collection, validation, storage&#13;
and dissemination. Appropriate skills will have to be developed to operate the computing and&#13;
laboratory facilities provided under the project and to maintain the improved hydrometric networks.&#13;
A high level of inter-agency coordination will be required for development of computerized data&#13;
banks which are inter-active and accessible between data centers and can be accessed by other&#13;
public and private entities.&#13;
32.   The project would finance incremental project staff and other inputs to support institutional&#13;
initiatives intended to implement the project and to ensure sustainability into the future. The latter&#13;
include: office buildings, equipment and services; consulting services; project specific staff&#13;
training, and vehicles and their operational costs. In addition, support for selection of specialized&#13;
equipment, computing facilities and software, and for training of state agency staff will be&#13;
provided, as appropriate, by CWC, CGWB, NIH, CWPRS, IMD and the project consultants.&#13;
Improvements in Organizational Structure of MID and GSDA&#13;
33.   Creation of a New Hydrology Unit within the MID. A feature of the HP is to assist&#13;
Maharashtra in the creation of a hydrological service that will be able to meet future demands and&#13;
also will be capable of implementing and sustaining the project. MID would create a separate&#13;
Hydrology Unit, headed by a Chief Engineer, which would be responsible for all surface water&#13;
data collection and management. All hydrological data collection and processing would be carried&#13;
out by five Divisions which would be controlled by a Superintending Engineer (SE). A second SE&#13;
(Water Planning) would be responsible for the State surface water data center to be established at&#13;
Nasik and for the basin planning divisions. The two laboratories responsible for surface water&#13;
quality monitoring would come under the control of the Hydrology Unit. Figure I shows the&#13;
proposed organizational arrangements.&#13;
34.   Organizational Set up of GSDA. The organizational structure of GSDA will not require&#13;
fundamental change for project implementation. However the equivalent of a Circle under a&#13;
Director would be established within GSDA to control the data collection and data management&#13;
systems. Figure 2 shows the proposed organizational arrangements.&#13;
Staffing Requirements and Costs&#13;
35.   Surface Water Hydrology. Most of the staff required for creation of the new Hydrology&#13;
Unit will be provided from the existing staff of the Hydrology Divisions and the hydrology section&#13;
in the central design office. Other additional staff will be provided by redeployment within MID.&#13;
However, some specialized professional posts (chemists, experienced computer specialists) will&#13;
have to be filled by new recruitment. The estimated incremental costs of the Hydrology Unit for&#13;
salaries and allowances are Rs.57 million, or an average of Rs.9.5 million/yr over the project life.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
217&#13;
Annex 23&#13;
Page 7&#13;
36.   Groundwater Hydrology. The existing staff of GSDA will be adequate to implement much&#13;
of the state groundwater program. However, some additional staff will be required for the creation&#13;
of the groundwater data center, for the laboratories and for additional monitoring, and this will&#13;
entail new recruitment. It is estimated that the incremental costs of staff salaries and allowances for&#13;
the groundwater data collection and management activities under the project would total about Rs.&#13;
22.5 million, averaging about Rs.3.7 million/yr over the project life.&#13;
Training - State Agencies (Annex 1 1)&#13;
37.   Surface Water. The following will be the main subjects of training under the project: (a)&#13;
training of stream gauging staff and junior supervisory staff in hydrometry and maintenance of&#13;
instruments and ancillary equipment; (b) training of field level staff in sampling technology for&#13;
sediment observations and in sediment analyses; (c) training of field staff in water sampling and&#13;
carrying out on-site analysis; (d) training of junior professional staff of the laboratories in the use&#13;
of specialized laboratory equipment; and (e) training of professionals in the state surface water data&#13;
center, in the field hydrology division and in the laboratories in the use of computers for&#13;
hydrological data processing and for other software applications. Essentially all this training will&#13;
be carried out in-house within the Hydrology Unit to be established in MID through appropriate&#13;
training courses, and on-the-job training. In order to implement in-house training courses, it will&#13;
be necessary to train selected staff to be trainers. The training of trainers would be implemented&#13;
with the assistance of NIH and CWC. The WALMI facility at Aurangabad could become a facility&#13;
for traininig activities. Consultant services would be retained under the project to provide oversight&#13;
and advice on the design, context and implementation of the training activities.&#13;
38.   Additional to the above described training which relates to basic data collection and data&#13;
management systems, senior professional staff of the Hydrology Unit will be provided with&#13;
training in analytical hydrology and advanced computer software applications through training&#13;
courses run by NIH in Roorkee and post-graduate training in Indian universities and study tours in&#13;
India and abroad to observe appropriate hydrometric and data management systems. Senior&#13;
professionals from the laboratories will also be provided with advanced training.&#13;
39.   Hvdrometeorologv. The hydrometeorological observation networks maintained by MID&#13;
would be improved under the project. While the expansion element of the improvement program is&#13;
limited, improvement of the performance of the existing network would be an important activity.&#13;
This will involve training of observers in the proper performance of their duties, including&#13;
maintenance of instruments. The training of observers will be undertaken by IMD staffat the Pune&#13;
IMD Training Center. Supervisors and more senior staff will be trained at the IMD training facility&#13;
in Pune.&#13;
40.   Groundwater. The main subjects of groundwater training under the project will be: (a)&#13;
training of GSDA field staff in manual water level observations, water quality sampling, use of&#13;
field measuring equipment (biaxial electric tapes, EC meters, pH meters), and servicing of digital&#13;
water level recorders; (b) training of the junior professional staff of the laboratories in the use of&#13;
specialized laboratory equipment; and (c) training of professionals in the state groundwater data&#13;
center, in the Regional and District Offices of GSDA and in the laboratories in the use of computer&#13;
software for data processing and other software applications. The more advanced training will be&#13;
provided initially by CGWB's training arrangements in Faridabad and later through the National&#13;
Groundwater Training Institute to be established by CGWB in Raipur (Annex 16 of SDV). Junior&#13;
technical staff will be trained through courses run using a new GSDA training facility to be&#13;
established at Nasik (para 44). The suppliers of digital water level recorders will be required to&#13;
provide training on servicing and maintenance of the equipment . Project consultants will provide&#13;
oversight and advice for the training programs.&#13;
41.   The above training all relates to basic data collection and data management systems. In&#13;
addition, senior professional staff of GSDA will be provided with training in advanced&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
218&#13;
Annex 23&#13;
Page 8&#13;
hydrogeological analysis techniques, including computer modelling, through training courses run&#13;
by NIH in Roorkee and post-graduate training in Indian universities. Study tours in India and&#13;
abroad will be provided to observe appropriate groundwater monitoring networks and data&#13;
management systems. Senior professionals troon the laboratories will also be provided with&#13;
advanced training.&#13;
42.   Training Cost Estimates. Quantities. cost estimates and timing for training activities are&#13;
summarized in Table 1.&#13;
Office Buildings and Equipment-State Agencies&#13;
43.   Maharashtra Irrigation Department. Provision is made under the project to construct a&#13;
building for the state surface water data center at a cost of Rs.5.0 million. The project will also&#13;
provide residential buildings for staff at 274 gauging sites at a cost of Rs.38.4 million. New&#13;
laboratory buildings will be constructed with an estimated cost of Rs.2.1 million for 21 Level I&#13;
laboratories and Rs.2.0 million for two Level 11 laboratories. Office furnishings and equipment&#13;
(excluding computer facilities) and for training equipment have a total estimated cost of Rs.2.63&#13;
million.&#13;
44.   Groundwater Survey and Development Agency. The GSDA will be provided with three&#13;
laboratory buildings at an estimated total cost of Rs.3.0 million. In addition GSDA will receive&#13;
project support for the building of a state training centre at Nasik which is estimated to cost Rs.2.0&#13;
million. A lumpsum provision of Rs. 1.4 million is made for modifications to existing buildings to&#13;
house computer facilities. Costs of office equipment and furnishing, including training equipment&#13;
but excluding computers, ancillaries and software, are estimated at Rs. 1.84 million.&#13;
Vehicles - State Agencies&#13;
45.   Maharashtra Irrigation Department. Saloon cars will be provided for the CE of the&#13;
Hydrology Unit and for the two SEs of the data center and the field divisions. Five jeeps will be&#13;
provided for the field divisions, three jeeps for the planning divisions and two jeeps for the&#13;
laboratories. A minibus will be supplied for the training activities. The reservoir sedimentation&#13;
survey package will include one jeep and one lorry.&#13;
46.   Groundwater Survey and Development Agency. The vehicle fleets of the Regional and&#13;
District Offices will be supplemented by 23 jeeps. Six jeeps will be provided for the laboratories.&#13;
One saloon car will be provided for the Deputy Director.&#13;
Hydrological Services and Interaction with Data User Agencies&#13;
47.   A basic concept of the project is that hydrological data collection and its management and&#13;
dissemination should be regarded as a service to the public at large. Thus that all legitimate users&#13;
of the data should have clearly defined and easily acquired access to the data. Moreover, the data&#13;
collected should be made available in formats that are useful to the users. In many cases, the&#13;
publication of data summaries in the form of year books would suffice, and the project provides&#13;
funds for this purpose. Groundwater data often requires interpretation in the form of maps and&#13;
explanatory reports. Some users may require the original data and this could be provided as&#13;
printouts or on floppy disks. The possibility of payment for such services should be considered.&#13;
48.   Arranging access for interested government agencies should not present difficulties.&#13;
Provision of easy access to the data bases for legitimate private entities might be a problem. It is&#13;
proposed that a committee of interested data users should be established in the state. This would&#13;
give prominence to the availability of the data, reveal the demand for the type of data required and&#13;
the form of its presentation, and give direction for improvements to the hydrological service.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

and detailed in Annex 13b. All procurement would follow the standard procurement&#13;
documentation approved by the World Bank for works, goods and services.&#13;
50.   Works. The works to be implemented by the MID consists of relatively small buildings&#13;
and small structures for hydrological and hydrometeorological stations. These will be implemented&#13;
by LCB contracts according to Bank guidelines or by force account, as appropriate. The major&#13;
works element under GSDA will be construction of observation tubewells, which will be procured&#13;
by LCB contracts with local duilling companies or will be constructed with agency's own drilling&#13;
rigs under force account. The new building required by GSDA will be constructed by LCB&#13;
contracts.&#13;
51.   Goods. Implementation of the project will involve procurement of large quantities of&#13;
specialized hydrometric equipment, some specialized survey and laboratory equipment, and&#13;
computer hardware and software. These items will be procured centrally by ICB procedures as&#13;
described in para 4.04 of the SAR. The office equipment will be procured by LCB or by prudent&#13;
shopping procedures. The vehicles for the first year will be procured by prudent shopping from&#13;
the manufacturers according to Government standard rate contracts.  Subsequent vehicle&#13;
procurements will be by ICB or prudent shopping procedures, according to the size of the contract&#13;
package.&#13;
52.   Services. Consultant services will be procured by Central Government according to Bank&#13;
guidelines for foreign and local consultants. NICNET services will be provided according to&#13;
negotiated charges and fees arranged by Central Government. All other services will be provided&#13;
by the concemed agencies through force account procedures.&#13;
1. Project Coordination. Monitoring and Evaluation and Review&#13;
53.   Project Coordination. A small Project Coordination Group will be established in&#13;
Maharashtra to coordinate project activities implemented by the Hydrology Unit of MID and by the&#13;
GSDA. An important function of the group will be liaison with the central and local offices of&#13;
CWC, CGWB and MID, and with the offices of other agencies (NIH and CWPRS) which are&#13;
implementing project programs in the state. The Project Coordination Group will also have the&#13;
responsibility for project monitoring and evaluation and for the project reviews as described below.&#13;
54.   Monitoring and Evaluation. The monitoring and evaluation of this structurally complex&#13;
project in Maharashtra will be carried out by the State Project Coordination Group (para 52). The&#13;
exercise will cover both project implementation progress and the performance of the data collection&#13;
and management systems developed. The results of monitoring and evaluation will be reported in&#13;
the semi-annual reports and form a basis for the annual implementation reviews (para 55).&#13;
55.   Project Annual Reviews. Semi-annual progress reports will be prepared for the state by the&#13;
State Project Coordination Group and submitted to the Central Project Coordinating Secretariat for&#13;
inclusion in the project semi-annual progress reports. An annual implementation review of the&#13;
project will be undertakenunder the guidance of the Central Coordinating Committee with the Bank&#13;
not later than December 31 each year. The annual review arrangement will provide the flexibility&#13;
required to amend the state program for the following fiscal year to reflect performance in the past&#13;
year. and to incorporate any lessons learned into the future program. The State Coordinating&#13;
Group will have responsibility for presentation of information on the performance of&#13;
Maharashtra's part of the program for the annual implementation review.&#13;

HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Programs in Orissa&#13;
1.    Orissa lies on the east coast of India. It has a land area of 155,700 kmn2 and a population of&#13;
26.5 million in 1989. The mean annual rainfall is about 1500 mm, most of which occurs during the&#13;
southwest monsoon from July to September. October is also a wet month due to Bay of Bengal&#13;
cyclones. The main rivers are the Mahanadi, Subernarekha, Brahmani and Baitarani.&#13;
2.    Section A of the annex describes existing systems for hydrological observations and data&#13;
management; Section B summarizes proposed improvements to the observation systems; Section C&#13;
describes the establishment of interactive computerized data banks and inter-bank communication&#13;
systems; Section D discusses proposed improvements in reservoir instrumentation and&#13;
management; Section E describes the proposed improvements in the monitoring of return flows&#13;
from selected irrigated command areas; Section F covers real-time water resources management&#13;
through improved flood warning systems; Section G summarizes institutional strengthening&#13;
activities; Section H refers to procurement procedures; and Section I describes arrangements for&#13;
project performance monitoring and evaluation, and for project review. Detailed cost estimates for&#13;
state agency activities are shown by Table 1.&#13;
A. Existing Systems for Hydrological Observations and Data Management&#13;
Surface Water Hydrology&#13;
3.    Organizational Setup. The organization for hydrological services is under the Chief&#13;
Engineer (Water Planning) within the Orissa Water Resources Department (WRD). The Hydrology&#13;
Directorate under an SE controls six divisions, three of which are responsible for field data&#13;
collection, one for data processing and storage, one for water quality and one for reservoir&#13;
surveys. Each hydrology field division controls three or four sub-divisions.&#13;
4.    River Gauging Networks. WRD has established 49 gauging stations in ten river basins. All&#13;
the gauging stations make stage and discharge measurements. The CWC operates 21&#13;
stage/discharge stations in Orissa, of which two also observe sediment load and 9 monitor both&#13;
sediment and water quality.&#13;
5 .    Laboratorv Facilities. WRD does not maintain its own laboratory facilities for water quality&#13;
analysis. Water samples collected from the seven observation stations are analyzed by the&#13;
laboratory of the Orissa Agriculture University in Bhubaneswar. The analyses are concerned&#13;
mainly with the suitability of the water for irrigation. CWC analyses water samples taken from its&#13;
network at the Divisional laboratory in Bhubaneswar.&#13;
6.    Data Processing and Management. Discharge measurements at the WRD gauging sites are&#13;
obtained by trained technicians to develop stage/discharge rating curves. Discharge is computed by&#13;
a Junior Engineer. At present the WRD does not publish year books of riverflow data. The&#13;
Hydrology Directorate has recently started processing and storage of data on computers. The CWC&#13;
processes its data according to standard procedures (Annex 15).&#13;
Groundwater (GW) Hydrology&#13;
7.    Organizational Setup. The responsibility for GW exploration and assessment rests with the&#13;
Groundwater Survey and Investigation Board (GWSIB) of the Orissa Lift Irrigation Corporation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
228&#13;
AnnexL 24&#13;
Page 2&#13;
(OLIC), which comes under the Ministry of Rural Development (MRD). GWSIB is headed by a&#13;
Chief Engineer who is assisted by two SEs. There are eight field Divisions, seven of which carry&#13;
out hydrogeological investigations and GW monitoring and one is a Mechanical Division in charge&#13;
of drilling and pump testing. The CGWB has a Regional Office in Bhubaneswar which is&#13;
responsible for the Board's activities in Orissa.&#13;
8.    GW Monitoring Networks. The GWSIB collects water level data from a monitoring&#13;
network of 1,054 wells consisting of 90 open wells and 74 tubewells, where water levels are&#13;
recorded twice a year (pre- and post-monsoon), and 890 open wells where only pre-monsoon&#13;
levels are recorded. The open wells are not the property of the Board. Water quality monitoring is&#13;
not carried out systematically.&#13;
9.    The Regional Office of CGWB maintains a network comprising 1,131 observation wells&#13;
which, are monitored for water levels during 10-day periods four times each year (January, May,&#13;
August, November), and water samples are taken for analysis once a year in May. The water levels&#13;
are measured manually in the network. Only 51 of the observation points are tubewells, the&#13;
remainder being open wells which are not the property of the Board.&#13;
10.   Laboratory Facilities. The GWSIB has limited facilities to undertake chemical analyses of&#13;
water samples. The central laboratory at Bhubaneswar and four regional laboratories are poorly&#13;
equipped. Provision is made under an ongoing KfW (German Technical Assistance) project to&#13;
establish two laboratories in the coastal zone.&#13;
11.   The CGWB Regional Office has a well established Level II laboratory with experienced&#13;
staff. This handles the water analysis requirements of the office, and the staff is also involved in&#13;
interpretive work which has resulted in various scientific publications.&#13;
12.   Data Processing and Management. Essentially all GWSIB data is processed manually and&#13;
stored in paper files, though a recent development has been to use commercial computing facilities&#13;
for data storage. The CGWB Regional Office is using computers for management of its data and&#13;
makes use of NIC facilities in Bhubaneswar through a telephone linkage.&#13;
Hydrometeorology&#13;
13.   Organizational Setup. Several State and Central agencies in Orissa maintain rainfall and&#13;
climate stations, including the Department of Agriculture (DOA), the Department of Revenue&#13;
(DOR), the CWC, and the Indian Meteorological Department (IMD). At present, the WRD does not&#13;
maintain a meteorological network in the State.&#13;
14.   Hydrometeorological Network. The DOA, DOR, the CWC and the [MD together operate&#13;
460 rainfall stations. In addition, the IMD maintains 18 full climatic stations (FCS). WRD is in&#13;
the process of installing three automatic weather stations (AWS).&#13;
15.  Data Processing and Management. Computers are not used for storage and management of&#13;
the rainfall and other climate data collected by the state agencies in Orissa. However, the IMD&#13;
National Data Center at Pune receives data from 253 of the rainfall stations and the 23 FCSs&#13;
operated by IMD, and this information is stored on computers.&#13;
B. Improvements to Hydrological Observations Systems&#13;
Suiface Water Hydrology&#13;
16.   Upgrading of Data Collection Infrastructure. The component includes upgrading of all 49&#13;
existing river gauging stations and the provision of 26 new stations of various types. The project&#13;
wouild provide the following instrumentation for the existing and new stations:&#13;

17.   Improved Laboratory Facilities. WRD proposes to implement a routine water quality moni-&#13;
toring program for its rivers and reservoirs. This would entail constructing and equipping 11 Level&#13;
I laboratories for on-site analyses and a central chemical laboratory (Level II) at Bhubaneswar.&#13;
Each Level I station can also cover two or three adjacent stations. CWC's laboratory at&#13;
Bhubaneswar will be upgraded to Level II. Details of the equipment to be provided and the&#13;
analyses to be performed by each type of laboratory are described in Annex 5.&#13;
Groundwater Hydrology&#13;
18.   Upgrading of Data Collection Infrastructure. The GWSIB would install 305 observation&#13;
tubewells ranging in depth from 30 m to 300 m. Digital water level recorders would be installed on&#13;
the 305 new tubewells and on 70 existing tubewells. The CGWB would construct 175 observation&#13;
tubewells to a range of depths (30 - 300 m) and these would be equipped with digital water level&#13;
recorders. Details of the improvements to the State observation network are shown by Table 2.&#13;
19.   Improved Laboratorv Facilities. GWSIB will establish Level II laboratories at Balasore,&#13;
Berhampur, Bolangir and Sampalpur and a Level II+ laboratory at Bhubaneswar. All five&#13;
laboratories will be provided with new buildings. The CGWB Regional Office laboratory will be&#13;
upgraded to Level II+. Details of equipment to be provided and the analyses to be performed by&#13;
each type of facility are discussed in Annex 5.&#13;
Hydrometeorologv&#13;
20.   Improvements to Observation Network. The project would support installation of 75 standard&#13;
rain gauges (SRGs), 15 autographic rain gauges (ARGs) and nine FCSs at the new and existing river&#13;
gauging sites (para 16).&#13;
C. Improvements to Data Manazement and Communication Systems&#13;
Upgrading of Data Management Systems&#13;
21.   General. Separate state data centers would be established for surface water and for&#13;
groundwater. The surface water data center would be within the jurisdiction of the CE (HP) and it&#13;
would be located in Bhubaneswar. The state groundwater data center would be a unit within GWSIB&#13;
located in Bhubaneswar (GWSIB would be made a free-standing line organization in the DRD - para&#13;
37). The CWC's stream gauging and hydrometeorological observation networks in Orissa are&#13;
managed by a Division located in Bhubaneswar. The CGWB Regional Office in Bhubaneswar would&#13;
establish a data center for information collected from its observation network. The data management&#13;
systems of the four agencies would be fully computerized with software designed so that the data&#13;
bases could be interactive. Reference should be made to Annex 7 for more detailed discussion of data&#13;
management and data transfer systems.&#13;

22.   Checking and Entry of Historical Data into Computer Storage. This section refers mainly to&#13;
riverflow data collected by the Hydrology Directorate. Most of this data is now on paper files.&#13;
Although much of the data may be of doubtful quality, it must be recognized that it is, at present, all&#13;
that is available. Therefore, these existing data series must be stored for use until such time that a long&#13;
series of higher validity becomes available. Nevertheless, some validation of the data must be made to&#13;
remove obviously anomalous-observations before data are entered into computer storage or,&#13;
alternatively, a computer routine could be used to recognize possible anomalies after the data are&#13;
entered. It is evident that this exercise will be very subjective and will require care in application. The&#13;
next opportunity to review the historical data will be offered when a validated data series is developed&#13;
through project activities at a site where a secure rating curve can be derived. If comparison of the&#13;
rating curve with historical stage/discharge measurements reveals a 'systematic error' in the discharge&#13;
measurements, it may then be possible to 'correct' the data series for the site.&#13;
23.   State Surface Water Data Management -System. The data collected from the WRD's gauging&#13;
stations are first accumulated in the Sub-divisional Offices of the Hydrology Divisions after collection&#13;
from the sites by the concerned Section Offices. The three Divisional Offices and 10 Sub-divisional&#13;
Offices would be provided with computer package type D comprising: two personal computers (486&#13;
sx) and two ink-jet printers, plus UPSs, associated office fumiture and an air conditioner, together&#13;
with surface water data system and general purpose software. Data will be verified and entered into&#13;
computer storage at the Subdivision. Transfer of data to the Divisions and to the surface water data&#13;
center will be by a dial-up NICNET connection or by floppy disk. The surface water quality&#13;
laboratory will be provided with computer package type D with water quality data system and general&#13;
purpose software. Transfer of data from the laboratory to the SW data center will be by floppy disk.&#13;
The state SW data center will be provided with a computer package type A comprising: file server&#13;
(486dx2, EISA), eight personal computers (486dx2), two laser printers, 8 dot matrix printers, plotter&#13;
and digitizer, together with 9 UPSs, 6 air conditioners, a fax machine, a photocopier and office&#13;
furniture (see item 2.31, Annex 2, Table 2). Software provided will include: the surface water and&#13;
water quality data systems; an appropriate hydrological package; a general purpose package; and a&#13;
network package.&#13;
24.   State Groundwater Data Management System. A type B computer facility with accessories&#13;
and software for the GW and water quality data systems, a hydrogeological package, a general&#13;
purpose package, and a network package will be provided to establish a State groundwater data center&#13;
in Bhubaneswar. In addition type D computer facilities plus accessories and software for the GW&#13;
data system and general purposes will be provided for each of the existing seven field Divisions and a&#13;
new Division to be formed (para 37), and type D facilities with water quality data system and general&#13;
purpose software will be provided in each of the five laboratories. Transfer of data from the field&#13;
Divisions and from the laboratoties to the data center will be by a dial-up NICNET connection or by&#13;
floppy disk.&#13;
25.   CWC Divisional Office Data Management System. The CWC Divisional Office in&#13;
Bhubaneswar will be provided with a computer package type D together with surface water and water&#13;
quality data systems and a general purpose software package. The Divisional Office will be provided&#13;
with a dial-up NICNET connection for communication with its controlling Circle and Regional&#13;
Offices.&#13;
26.   CGWB Regional Office Data Management System. The CGWB Regional Office in&#13;
Bhubaneswar will be provided with a computer package type B in order to establish a data center for&#13;
the data collected from its network. The software packages to be provided include the groundwater&#13;
and water quality data systems, an appropriate hydrogeological package, and a general purpose&#13;
package. The Regional Office laboratory will be provided with a computer package type D together&#13;
with water quality data system and general purpose software. Data will be transferred from the&#13;
laboratory to the Regional Office data bank by floppy disk.&#13;
27.   Communication Systems between Data Banks. The data banks established in WRD and in the&#13;
CWC Regional Office in Hyderabad for surface water data must be interactive and the communication&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
231&#13;
Annex 24&#13;
Page 5&#13;
system provided must allow each entity access on a 'read only' basis. Similarly the data banks&#13;
established for groundwater data in GWSIB and the CGWB Regional Office must be directly&#13;
interactive through a communication system allowing unrestricted access. All these data centers will&#13;
be provided with dedicated telephone land line connections with their local NICNET ground station to&#13;
achieve the necessary communication linkages.&#13;
28.   It will be necessary to transfer data collected by the WRD and CWC Regional Office surface&#13;
water data centers to CWC's national data center in New Delhi. It will also be necessary to transfer&#13;
groundwater data from the GWSIB and CGWB Regional Office data centers to CGWB's national&#13;
data center in Faridabad. NICNET ground stations will be provided by the project for the central&#13;
surface water data bank in CWC headquarters and for the central groundwater data bank in CGWB&#13;
headquarters. The dedicated land line connections to NICNET provided for the state and regional&#13;
office data centers will allow communication with the national data centers.&#13;
D. Improvements to Reservoir Instrumentation and Management&#13;
Reservoir Instrumentation&#13;
29.   WRD will undertake a study to check the gate ratings for a number of existing reservoirs.&#13;
This work would be carried out using physical modelling of the gates at the WRD's Engineering&#13;
Research Laboratory in collaboration with CWPRS. A second WRD study relates to measurement of&#13;
reservoir releases through the undersluice gates of Hirakud dam. This will involve installation of a&#13;
number of gauging stations on the downstream canals and river. The data collected could provide&#13;
information on existing gate leakage and would also provide a means of checking the assumed ratings&#13;
of outlet gates. Lump sum provision of Rs. 3.5 million is made for the studies.&#13;
Reservoir Sedimentation Surveys&#13;
30.   WRD has proposed a program of sedimentation surveys for the existing 35 major and medium&#13;
reservoirs. The project would provide a package of specialized equipment for this purpose&#13;
comprising: 25 ft/40 HP boat and trailer; satellite trisponder position system; distomat electronic&#13;
measurer; echotrac echosounder; general survey equipment; walkie talkie radio sets; digital&#13;
planimeters; and sediment sampling and analysis sets. The survey package will include one jeep and&#13;
one lorry. One type D computer package will be provided for calculation and graphics.&#13;
E. Monitoring of Return Flows&#13;
31.   The project would support experimental work for monitoring of return flows in the&#13;
Chaukinallah area. The study involves detailed monitoring of the hydrological regime of the command&#13;
area. The data requirements include rainfall and other meteorological parameters, time series of&#13;
irrigation diversions, observed return flows which would be measured at specially installed gauging&#13;
stations downstream the command area, and groundwater levels and abstractions. A mathematical&#13;
model capable of describing the hydrological regime of the command area may be developed. A lump&#13;
sum provision of Rs. 1.0 million is made for this study.&#13;
F. Improvements to Real-Time Water Resources Management&#13;
32.   Improved Telemetry on Brahmani River. The Brahmani delta in Orissa is ravaged by floods&#13;
almost every year. The flooding is occasionally amplified by flood water from the Baitarani river,&#13;
which is linked to the Brahmani delta. The Rengali dam controls about two thirds of the Brahmani&#13;
catchment area. Releases from the dam are presently decided only on the basis of conditions at the&#13;
dam and CWC predictions of inflow, based on gauge to gauge correlations and using data of one&#13;
upstream real-time station. To enable more efficient management of Rengali reservoir, and to provide&#13;
better information for flood forecasting on the Brahmani delta, the project will support provision of&#13;
additional telemetering equipment in the Brahmani basin in two phases:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
232                                 Annex 24&#13;
Page 6&#13;
(a)  installation of ten telemetering stations in the basin in Orissa is expected to provide a&#13;
lead time of about 24 hours for the inflow forecasts to the reservoir and the delta.&#13;
The cost of the telemetry system is estimated at about Rs.8.0 million; and&#13;
(b)   Phase II will extend the telemetering system to include the upper catchment of the&#13;
Brahmani river in Bihar in order to provide a longer forecast lead time. This&#13;
extension has been estimated to cost about Rs.6.7 million.&#13;
33.   Flood Forecasting Study for the Brahmani River. Development of a real-time flood&#13;
forecasting system for the Brahmani river is to be undertaken as a study under the HP. The study&#13;
will utilize all historical rainfall and flow data from State and CWC stations and other sources in the&#13;
Brahmani catchment. Catchment modelling techniques will be used to develop a validated flood&#13;
forecasting system for the basin. The results of the study would be used to define the locations for&#13;
the telemetering stations to be installed in the Brahmani basin (para 32). A provision of about&#13;
Rs. 10 million is made for procurement of a suitable flood forecasting model and for specialist&#13;
consultancy services on flood forecasting.&#13;
G. Institutional Strengthening&#13;
Genereal&#13;
34.   Institutional performance needs to be strengthened for data collection, validation, storage&#13;
and dissemination. Appropriate skills will have to be developed to operate the computing and&#13;
laboratory facilities provided under the project and to maintain the improved hydrometric networks.&#13;
A high level of inter-agency coordination will be required for development of computerized data&#13;
banks which are inter-active and accessible between data centers and can be accessed by legitimate&#13;
public and private entities.&#13;
35.   The project would finance incremental project staff and other inputs to support new&#13;
institutional initiatives intended to implement the project and to ensure sustainability into the future.&#13;
The latter would include office buildings, equipment and services; consultant services; project&#13;
specific staff training; and vehicles and their operational costs. Support for selection of specialized&#13;
equipment and of computing facilities and software, and for training of state agency staff will be&#13;
provided, as appropriate, by CWC, CGWB, NIH, CWPRS, IMD and the retained consultants of&#13;
the project.&#13;
Proposed Organizational Setup&#13;
36.   Surface Water. Under the proposed Orissa Water Resources Consolidation Project, a Water&#13;
Planning Organization (WPO) is being established in WRD under a CE. The WPO will be&#13;
responsible for the tasks of River Basin Planning. The GOO has agreed to create a post of CE&#13;
exclusively for HP for collection and management of all surface water data. A Director&#13;
(Hydrometry) of SE rank will be responsible for surface water data collection and management. He&#13;
will be assisted by three Deputy Directors of EE rank which will command river gauging&#13;
Divisions, based in Cuttack, Balasore and Berhampur. A Director will also be responsible for the&#13;
running of the State water data center. He will be assisted by three Deputy Directors of EE rank in&#13;
charge of Divisions responsible for: (a) water quality and reservoir sedimentation surveys; (b)&#13;
coordination and training; and (c) computing (data processing). The CE (WPO) will act as Member-&#13;
Secretary of the Orissa Water Resources Board (OWRB) which is being created to develop and&#13;
coordinate the State's long-term water policy and planning. The CE (HP) will also be a Memeber&#13;
of the OWRB. An organization chart are shown by Figure 1.&#13;
37.   Groundwater. It is proposed to delink GWSIB from the OLIC and make it a free-standing&#13;
line organization within the Ministry of Rural Development. It will continue with its basic functions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex 24&#13;
233                                    Page 7&#13;
of groundwater data collection and management and hydrogeological investigation. The basic&#13;
structure of GWSIB will not change, but a unit of about division strength will be created for the&#13;
data center, an additional field hydrogeological Division will be created, and the laboratories will be&#13;
strengthened. An organization chart is shown by Figure 2.&#13;
38.   Office Buildings and Equipment - State Agencies. The State surface water data center will&#13;
be in the headquarters of the project in Bhubaneswar. The land for a new building for the HP has&#13;
already been allocated. A provision of some Rs. 1 5.8million is made for new office buildings and&#13;
staff accommodation. The cost of new and improved office buildings for the GWSIB will be bome&#13;
by the project. A provision of about Rs.6.5 million is made for buildings for a new headquarters&#13;
office, for computer facilities and for staff quarters. The project will provide office furnishings and&#13;
training and other related equipment at a cost of about Rs.3.9 million for surface water hydrology&#13;
activities and Rs. 1.31 million for groundwater hydrology activities.&#13;
39.   Computers for Administration and Management. As noted (paras 23, 24), computing&#13;
facilities for water data management systems will be provided in the water data centers, and various&#13;
offices and laboratories of the Hydrology Directorates of the HP and of GWSIB. The computers in&#13;
each of these offices will be provided with a general purpose software package, primarily for&#13;
administration purposes.&#13;
40.   Vehicles. The SW data collection and management activities under HP would require 19&#13;
vehicles as follows: 11 jeeps for hydrometry, one jeep attached to the laboratory, three cars for the&#13;
CE (HP), Director (hydrometry) and the Director SW data center respectively; one minibus to be&#13;
used for training activities; and one jeep and one lorry for reservoir sedimentation surveys. The&#13;
GWSIB would be provided with a total of 28 jeeps for field operations and five jeeps to be attached&#13;
to the laboratories.&#13;
Training (Annex 10)&#13;
41.   Surface Water Training Activities. The following will be the main subjects of training&#13;
under the project: (a) training of stream gauging staff and junior supervisory staff in the technology&#13;
of hydrometry and maintenance of instruments and ancillary equipment; (b) training of field level&#13;
staff in sampling technology for sediment observations and in sediment analyses; (c) training of&#13;
field staff in water quality sampling and on-site water quality analyses; (d) training of junior&#13;
professional staff of the laboratories in the use of specialized laboratory equipment; and (e) training&#13;
of professionals in the state surface water data center, in the field hydrology Divisions and&#13;
Subdivisions and in the laboratories in the use of computers for hydrological data processing and&#13;
for other software applications. Essentially all this training will be carried out in-house within the&#13;
Hydrology Directorate through appropriate training courses, and on-the-job training. In order to&#13;
implement in-house training courses, it will be necessary to train selected staff from the Directorate&#13;
to be trainers. The training of trainers would be implemented with the assistance of NIH and CWC.&#13;
Consultant services would be retained under the project to provide oversight and advice on the&#13;
design, context and implementation of these training activities.&#13;
42.   Additional to the above described training which relates to basic data collection and data&#13;
management systems, senior professional staff of the Hydrology Directorate will be provided with&#13;
training in analytical hydrology and advanced computer software applications through training&#13;
courses run by NIH in Roorkee and post-graduate training in Indian universities. Study tours in&#13;
India and abroad will be provided to observe appropriate hydrometric and data management&#13;
systems. Senior professionals from the laboratories will also be provided with advanced training.&#13;
43.   Hydrometeorological Observation Training. A hydrometeorological observation network to&#13;
be maintained by the Hydrology Directorate would be established under the project. This will&#13;
involve training of observers in the proper performance of their duties, including maintenance of&#13;
instruments. The training of observers will be provided by IMD at its Calcutta Training Center.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
234&#13;
Annex 24&#13;
Page 8&#13;
Training of supervisors and more advanced meteorological training will be provided by IMD at its&#13;
training establishment in Pune.&#13;
44.   Groundwater Training Activities. The main subjects of groundwater training under the&#13;
project will be: (a) training of GSWIB field staff in manual water level observations, water quality&#13;
sampling, use of field measuring equipment (biaxial electric tapes, EC meters, pH meters, etc.), and&#13;
servicing of digital water level recorders; (b) training of the junior professional staff of the&#13;
laboratories in the use of specialized laboratory equipment; and (c) training of professionals in the&#13;
state groundwater data center, in the field Divisions and in the laboratories in the use of computer&#13;
software for hydrological data processing and other software applications. This training will be&#13;
provided through the National Groundwater Training Institute to be established by CGWB in&#13;
Raipur, with junior technical staff trained through courses run using WALMI facilities. The&#13;
suppliers of digital water level recorders will be required to provide training on servicing and&#13;
maintenance of the equipment. Retained consultants will provide oversight and advice for the&#13;
training programs.&#13;
45.   The above training all relates to basic data collection and data management systems. In&#13;
addition, senior professional staff of GSWIB will be provided with training in advanced&#13;
hydrogeological analysis techniques, including computer modelling, through training courses run&#13;
by NIH in Roorkee and post-graduate training in Indian universities. Study tours in India and&#13;
abroad will oe provided to observe appropriate groundwater monitoring networks and data&#13;
management systems. Senior professional staff from the laboratories will also be provided with&#13;
advanced training.&#13;
46.   Training Cost Estimates. Quantities, cost estimates and timing for surface water and&#13;
groundwater related training activities are shown by Table 1.&#13;
Staffing Requirements and Costs&#13;
47.   The establishment of a new Hydrology Unit in the HP will mainly involve redeployment of&#13;
existing staff. However, some specialized professional posts (chemists, experienced computer&#13;
specialists) and staffing of new stream and rain gauging sites will have to filled by new r ecruitment.&#13;
The estimated incremental costs of salaries and allowances under the Hydrology Unit total about&#13;
Rs.30.4 million, equivalent to about Rs.5. 1 million/yr over the life of the project.&#13;
48.   The existing staff for GWSIB will be adequate to implement most of the state groundwater&#13;
programs. but newly recruited staff will be required for some specialist posts. The incremental costs&#13;
of staffing and allowances for the groundwater activities under the project are estimated to total&#13;
about Rs. 12.0 million, averaging about Rs.2.0 million/yr over the life of the project.&#13;
Hydrological Services and Interaction with Data User Agencies&#13;
49.   A basic concept of the project is that hydrological data collection and its management and&#13;
dissemination should be regarded as a service to the public, and thus that all legitimate users of the&#13;
data should have clearly defined and easily acquired access to the data.  Moreover, the data&#13;
collected should be made available in formats that are useful to the users. In many cases, the&#13;
publication of data summaries in the form of year books would suffice. Groundwater data often&#13;
requires interpretation in the form of maps and explanatory reports. Some users may require the&#13;
original data which could be provided as printouts or on floppy disks. The possibility of payment&#13;
for such services should be considered.&#13;
50.   Arranging access for interested government agencies should not present difficulties.&#13;
Provision of easy access to the data bases for legitimate private entities might be a problem. It is&#13;
proposed that a committee of interested data users should be established in the State. This would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
235&gt;                                Annex 24&#13;
Page 9&#13;
give prominence to the availability of the data, reveal the demand for the type of data required and&#13;
the form of its presentation, and give direction for improvements to the hydrological service.&#13;
H. Procurement&#13;
5 1.   General. The procurement arrangements for the project are described in paras 4.03-4.07&#13;
and detailed in Annex 13b. All procurement would follow the standard procurement documentation&#13;
approved by the World Bank for works, goods and services.&#13;
52.   Works. The works to be implemented by the Hydrology Directorate consist of buildings&#13;
and small structures for hydrometric and hydrometeorological stations. These will be implemented&#13;
by LCB contracts according to Bank guidelines or by force account, as appropriate. The major&#13;
works element under GWSIB will be construction of observation tubewells, most of which will be&#13;
procured by LCB contracts with local drilling companies, but the wells with more difficult designs&#13;
will be constructed with agency's own drilling rigs under force account.&#13;
53.   Goods. Implementation of the project will involve procurement of large quantities of&#13;
specialized hydrometric equipment, some specialized survey and laboratory equipment, and&#13;
computer hardware and software. These items will be procured by ICB as described in para 4.04 of&#13;
the SAR. The office equipment will be procured by LCB or prudent shopping procedures. The&#13;
vehicles for the first year will be procured from the manufacturers by prudent shopping according to&#13;
Government standard rate contracts. Subsequent vehicle procurement will be by ICB or prudent&#13;
shopping, according to the size of the contract package.&#13;
54.   Services. Consultant services will be procured by Central Government according to Bank&#13;
guidelines for foreign and local consultants. NICNET services will be provided according to&#13;
negotiated charges and fees arranged by Central Government. All other services will be provided&#13;
by the concerned agencies through force account procedures.&#13;
I. Project Coordination. Monitoring and Evaluation and Review&#13;
55.   Project Coordination. A small Project Coordination Group will be established in the State to&#13;
cooredinate project activities implemented by the Hydrology Directorate of WPO and by the GWSIB&#13;
(SAR, paras 5.18, 5.20). An important function of the group will be liaison within the central and&#13;
local offices of CWC, CGWB and IMD and with other agencies (NIH, CWPRS) with project&#13;
functions in the State. The Project Coordination Group will also have the responsibility for project&#13;
monitoring and evaluation and project reviews described below.&#13;
56.   Monitoring and Evaluation. The monitoring and evaluation of this structurally complex&#13;
project in Orissa will be carried out by the State Project Coordination Group (para 54). The exercise&#13;
will cover both project implementation progress and the performance of the data collection and&#13;
management systems developed. The results of monitoring and evaluation will be reported in semi-&#13;
annual progress reports and form a basis for the annual implementation reviews (para 57).&#13;
57.   Project Annual Reviews. Semi-annual progress reports will be prepared for the state by the&#13;
State Project Coordination Group and submitted to the Central Project Coordinating Secretariat for&#13;
inclusion in the project semi-annual progress reports. An annual implementation review of the&#13;
project will be undertakenunder the guidance of the Central Coordinating Committee with the Bank&#13;
not later than December 31 each year. The annual review arrangement will provide the flexibility&#13;
requi-ed to amend the state program for the following fiscal year to reflect performance in the past&#13;
year, and to incorporate any lessons leamed into the future program. The State Coordinating Group&#13;
will have responsibility for presentation of information on the performance of Orissa's part of the&#13;
program for the annual implementation review.&#13;

HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Programs in Tamil Nadu&#13;
Background&#13;
1.    The State of Tamil Nadu, lying on the south-eastern coast of India, has a land area of&#13;
130,210 km2 and a population of about 56 million in 1989. The climate is generally hot and humid.&#13;
Precipitation is caused mainly by the northeast monsoon during October-December. The southwest&#13;
monsoon is also active and the state receives significant rainfall from June to September. Some&#13;
rainfall occurs in March to May due to thunderstorm activities. The Cauvery is the largest river&#13;
system in the state, but there are numerous smaller systems.&#13;
2.    Section A of this Annex describes existing systems of hydrological data observations and&#13;
management. Section B summarizes proposed upgrading of data collection system. Section C&#13;
describes the proposed upgrading of data management through the establishment of interactive data&#13;
banks and inter-bank communication system. Sector D summarizes proposed improvements in&#13;
reservoir instrumentation and management. Section E describes improvements to monitoring of&#13;
return flows from selected irrigation schemes; Section F covers institutional strengthening activities;&#13;
Section G refers to procurement procedures. Section H summarizes arrangements for project&#13;
peiformance monitoring and evaluation, and for the project review process. Detailed cost estimates&#13;
for state agency activities are shown by Table 1.&#13;
A. Existing Systems for Hydrological Observations and Data Management&#13;
Surface Water Hydrology&#13;
3.    Organizational Setup. Under the proposed World Bank funded Tamil Nadu Water Resources&#13;
Consolidation Project (WRCP), the existing Public Works Department (PWD) is to be split into two&#13;
departments, namely the Water Resources Department (WRD) and the Buildings Department. The&#13;
surface water and groundwater data collection and processing will be the responsibility of a unit&#13;
under a CE within the WRD. At present, there is only one Division with two Sub-Divisions in&#13;
charge of river gauging and data collection. The professional and non-professional staff engaged in&#13;
surface water hydrology totals about 80 and the annual budget provision for the Hydrology Division&#13;
during 1993-94 was about Rs. 3.0 million.&#13;
4.    River Gauging Stations. The Hydrology Division of PWD operates 54 gauging stations of&#13;
which 12 are located in the Cauvery basin. Flows are also being measured by the PWD at some of&#13;
the existing anicuts and reservoirs. The CWC operates 20 gauging stations in various basins as&#13;
follows: Cauvery (8), Palar and Ponniar (3 each), Vaigai (2) and Barthpuzha, Cheyyar, Vellar and&#13;
Vaippar (1 each). Sedimentation studies have been carried out by PWD in 7 reservoirs in the State&#13;
with studies in progress in a further 11 reservoirs. Sediment sampling is not being carried out at&#13;
present by PWD, but CWC collects data at eight of its existing observation stations. The CWC&#13;
collects water samples for quality analyses from eight of its gauging stations.&#13;
5.    Laboratory Facilities. The PWD does not have a regular surface water quality monitoring&#13;
program. The water quality data are only collected for the purpose of project design, and the interest&#13;
of PWD lies primarily in the suitability of water for irrigation. The CWC has a laboratory facility in&#13;
Tanil Nadu at its Coimbatore Divisional Office.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

6.    Data Processing and Management. The data collected in the field are processed manually at&#13;
Sub-Divisional offices and kept in registers in the Divisional, Circle or CE offices. The transmission&#13;
of data is done by messenger or by post. Tamil Nadu's Institute of Water Studies (IWS) also acts as&#13;
a repository for river flow and meteorological data. Computers are available at IWS which has&#13;
started computerized processing and storage of data.&#13;
Groundwater Hydrology&#13;
7.    Organizational Setup. The Ground Water Wing (GWW) of the PWD, headed by a CE with a&#13;
headquarter in Madras, is the organization responsible for all aspects of groundwater hydrology. It&#13;
comprises three Circles with headquarters in Madras, Thanjavur and Madurai. The Circles run a total&#13;
of ten Divisions and there are 37 Engineering Subdivisions and 19 Geological Subdivisions. The&#13;
GWW has more than 400 professional staff. The Central Ground Water Board (CGWB) Regional&#13;
Office in Hyderabad has a Unit Office in Madras (which will be upgraded to a Regional Office) with&#13;
responsibilities for the geographical area of Tamil Nadu.&#13;
8.    Groundwater Monitoring Networks. The GWW  monitors a network of about 2,500&#13;
observation wells, most of which tap the phreatic aquifer systems. There are 102 tubewells equipped&#13;
with automatic water level recorders in the network. The remaining open wells have their water&#13;
levels measured manually in the first week of each month. Water samples are taken for chemical&#13;
analyses from all open wells twice each year, immediately prior to and after monsoon season. Two&#13;
other State government agencies monitor groundwater levels. The Water Supply and Drainage&#13;
Authority (in the Department of Health) has established a network of 300 tubewells for monitoring&#13;
water levels, and these are measured pre- and post-monsoon. The Madras Metropolitan Development&#13;
Authority monitors levels in about 60 open wells in the city by weekly manual measurements.&#13;
9.    The CGWB Unit Office in Madras maintains a network of 834 observation wells of which&#13;
685 are open wells in the phreatic aquifer systems and 149 are tubewells. Water levels are measured&#13;
manually in the entire network during fixed ten-day periods four times each year (January, May,&#13;
August and November). Water samples are taken from open wells for chemical analysis in May each&#13;
year.&#13;
10.   Laboratory Facilitie. The GWW  has established laboratories in its Regional Offices in&#13;
Madras, Thanjavur and Madurai. All GWW laboratories are intended to carry out the standard&#13;
chemical analyses associated with assessment of water quality for irrigation. They together carry out&#13;
about 9,000 sample analyses each year. The CGWB unit office has no laboratory facility in the State&#13;
and the samples collected are analyzed in the laboratory of the Regional Office in Hyderabad.&#13;
11.   Data_Processing andManagement. The GWW database is presently on files which are&#13;
managed manually. There are no computers in the Circle or Divisional Offices. The CGWB Unit&#13;
Office shares a PC with the CGWB Drilling Division in Madras which is located in the same&#13;
building. The computerized data is normally transferred to the Hyderabad Regional Office as a file&#13;
print-out, but a staff member from the Regional Office visits Madras from time to time to lift&#13;
information from the computer on floppy disk.&#13;
Hydrometeorology&#13;
12.   Qrganizational Setu. As in other states of India, several state agencies in Tamil Nadu&#13;
maintain networks of rainfall and climate stations, including the PWD and the Departments of&#13;
Revenue, Railways, Forest and Agriculture. In addition, the India Meteorological Department ([MD)&#13;
has its own network of rainfall and climate stations. The CWC has no rainfall or climatic stations in&#13;
Tamil Nadu.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

13.   Hvdrometeorological Networks,  The State network (other than PWD) comprises 619&#13;
standard rain gauges (SRG), 29 autographic rain gauges (ARG) and 17 full climatic stations (FCS).&#13;
The PWD operates 330 SRG, 151 ARG and 13 FCS. The IMD maintains 15 SRG, 25 ARG and 17&#13;
FCSs.&#13;
14.   Data Processing and Man.agement. Computers are not used for routine processing and&#13;
management of the rainfall and climatic data collected by PWD and other state agencies in Tamil&#13;
Nadu. The IMD's data center in Pune receives data from 387 rainfall stations in Tamil Nadu, and&#13;
this information is stored by computers.&#13;
B. Improvements to Hydrological Observations Systems&#13;
Surface Water Hydrology&#13;
15.   Upgrading of Data Collection Infrastrupture. The upgraded WRD network will consist of&#13;
120 gauging stations of various types while the CWC network will remain at 20 stations. In addition&#13;
to river flow data, sediment samples will be collected at 40 WRD stations and water quality sarnples&#13;
will be taken at 35 stations. Details of the objectives of the upgrading of data collection&#13;
infrastructure are discussed in Annex 3.&#13;
16.   The proposed improvements to WRD's gauging network include: (a) establishment or&#13;
upgrading of 120 gauging stations of which 100 stations would be equipped with autographic water&#13;
level recorders and 20 with staff gauges; (b) provision of four propeller-type and 60 cup-type current&#13;
meter packages including echo sounders and other ancillary equipments; (c) provision of 60 bridge&#13;
outfits, five cableways outfits (fitted with winch and cradle), and 15 standard cableways, and 12&#13;
boats with engines; (d) provision of ten sediment sampling packages for collecting sediment data at&#13;
40 stations; (e) construction of 15 new silt analysis laboratories at selected gauging sites and&#13;
provision of silt analysis equipment; and (f) construction of 41 site equipment stores.&#13;
17.   Laboratory Facilities. Surface water and groundwater quality samples will be analyzed at&#13;
four shared chemical laboratories to be located at Madras, Madurai, Tiruchi and Pollachi. (The&#13;
existing GWW groundwater laboratory at Thanjavur will be shifted to Tiruchi.) The facility at&#13;
Madras would be upgraded to Level II+ standard. The Madurai, Tiruchi and Pollachi facilities would&#13;
be of Level II standard. New buildings will be provided for the laboratories at Madras and Pollachi&#13;
and buildings will be upgraded from the Madurai and Tiruchi facilities. In addition, the project&#13;
would construct and equip 15 level I laboratories at selected river gauging station sites. Details of the&#13;
equipment to be provided and the analyses to be carried out by each type of laboratory are discussed&#13;
in Annex 5.&#13;
Ground Water Hydrology&#13;
18.   Upgrading of Data Collection Infrastructure. The existing GWW network of observation&#13;
wells will increase from 2,500 locations that are monitored at present to 2,583 locations after&#13;
completion of the project. The project will provide 773 purpose-built observation wells. The&#13;
improved network will comprise 603 tubewells equipped with digital water level recorders, 102&#13;
tubewells equipped with float type AWLR, 320 tubewells which will be manually measured, and&#13;
1,558 open wells which will be manually measured. The CGWB Regional Office observation&#13;
network will increase from the present 835 wells to 903 after completion of the project. The network&#13;
will include 318 new and existing tubewells equipped with digital water level recorders, 235&#13;
tubewells which will be manually measured, and 350 open wells which will be manually measured.&#13;

Annex 25&#13;
Page 4&#13;
Details of the improvements to be provided to the State network are given in Table 1. Reference&#13;
should be made Annex 4 for more detailed discussion of groundwater network improvements.&#13;
19.   Laboratory Facilities. Analysis of groundwater samples will be made at a Level H+ facility in&#13;
Madras and at Level II laboratories in Madurai, Tiruchi and Pollachi. The laboratories will serve for&#13;
monitoring both surface water and groundwater as described in para 17. The CGWB Regional&#13;
Office to be created in Madras with responsibility for Tamnil Nadu will be provided with a Level II+&#13;
laboratory.&#13;
Hydrometeoroloyg&#13;
20.   Improvements to Observation Network. The existing PWD network in Tamil Nadu will be&#13;
augmented by installation of 42 ARGs, 20 FCSs and three automatic weather stations (AWS). A&#13;
budget provision is made for replacements and spare parts for existing and new equipment. The&#13;
CWC will establish three ARG stations and five FCSs.&#13;
C. Improvements to Data Management and Communication System&#13;
{Watr DMa Centers&#13;
21.   Separate state data centers for surface water and for groundwater would be established within&#13;
the water data management unit of WRD. The CGWB's new Regional Office in Madras would&#13;
establish a data center for information collected from its observation network in Tamil Nadu. The&#13;
CWC's Regional Office in Coimbatore would also establish a surface water data center. The data&#13;
management systems would be fully computerized with software designed so that the data bases can&#13;
be interactive.&#13;
Checking and Entry of Historical Data into Computer Storage&#13;
22.   This section refers mainly to surface water flow data collected by the PWD which is now on&#13;
paper files. Although at least part of this data may be of doubtful quality, it must be recognized that it&#13;
is, at present, all that is available. Therefore, these existing data series must be stored for use until&#13;
such time that a long series of higher validity becomes available. Nevertheless, some validation of&#13;
the data must be made to remove obviously anomalous observations before data are entered into&#13;
computer storage. It is evident that this exercise will be very subjective and will require care in&#13;
application. The next opportunity to review the historical data will be offered when a validated data&#13;
series is developed through project activities at a stable site where a secure rating curve can be&#13;
derived. If comparison of the rating curve with historical stage/discharge measurements reveals a&#13;
systematic error, it may then be possible to correct the data series for the site.&#13;
State Surface Water Data Management System&#13;
23.   The data collected from the gauging stations will accumulate in the four surface water&#13;
hydrology divisions to be located in Madras, Madurai, Tiruchi and Pollachi, after collection from&#13;
gauging sites by the concerned Subdivisions and Sections Offices. The four Divisions would each&#13;
be provided with computer package type D comprising: two personal computers (486 sx) and two&#13;
ink-jet printers plus two UPSs, associated office furniture and an air conditioner, together with&#13;
surface water data system and general purpose software. Transfer of data to the surface water data&#13;
center will be by a dial-up NICNET connection or by floppy disk. The water quality laboratories&#13;
(para 17) will be provided with computer package type D with water quality data system and general&#13;
purpose software. Transfer of data from laboratories to the surface water data center will be by their&#13;
Division's dial-up NICNET service or by floppy disk. The state surface data center will be provided&#13;

computer package Type B with accessories in order to establish a data center for the data collected&#13;
from its network. The software packages to be provided include groundwater and water quality data&#13;
systems, an appropriate hydrogeological package, a general purpose package and a network&#13;
package. The Regional Office laboratory will be provided with a computer package type D together&#13;
with water quality data system and general purpose software. Data will be transferred from the&#13;
laboratory to the Regional Office data bank by floppy disk.&#13;
IMD Regional Data Management Service&#13;
27.   The IMD Regional Meteorological Center in Madras will be provided with a computer&#13;
package type C (para 25) and appropriate software for management of the rainfall and climatic data&#13;
generated by the state hydrology unit in Tamil Nadu. Transfer of this data from the state water data&#13;
center to the IMD Regional Center will be by floppy disk.&#13;
Communication Systems between Data Banks&#13;
28.   The surface water data banks established in WRD and in the CWC Regional Office in&#13;
Coimbatore must be interactive on a 'read only' basis. Similarly, the State's groundwater data bank&#13;
and the CGWB Regional Office data bank must be interactive. The state's water data center and the&#13;
Regional Offices of CWC and CGWB will be provided with a NICNET connection to their local&#13;
NICNET ground station through a dedicated telephone land line. This will allow data exchange&#13;
between concerned agencies in the state and data transfer to the central surface water and&#13;
groundwater banking systems at New Delhi and Faridabad respectively.&#13;

D. Improvements to Reservoir Instrumentation and Management&#13;
Reservoir Sedimentation Surveys&#13;
29.   The PWD has an ongoing program of sedimentation surveys of some 62 existing major and&#13;
medium reservoirs and tanks. Surveys of 12 reservoirs have been completed and of further 11&#13;
surveys are in progress. Lack of appropriate equipment and funds has been a major constraint in&#13;
completing the surveys. The Institute of Hydraulics and Hydrology, Poondi, which comes under&#13;
CE Design and Construction, carries out the survey work. The project will provide a package of&#13;
reservoir surveying equipment comprising: 25 ft/40 HP boat with trailer; satellite trisponder position&#13;
system; distomat electronic measurer; echotrac echo sounder; general survey equipment; walkie talkie&#13;
radio sets; digital planimeters; and sediment sampling and analysis equipment. A type D computer&#13;
package will be provided for calculations and graphics. The set will include one lorry and one jeep.&#13;
The surveys will be repeated at intervals of about five years.&#13;
Reservoir Instrumentation&#13;
30.   Under HP, autographic water level recorders will be installed on 150 existing reservoirs and&#13;
tanks. Discharge relationships for some "unconventional anicuts", will be determined by hydraulic&#13;
studies at a cost of about Rs.5.0 million.&#13;
E. Monitoring of Return Flows&#13;
31.   In common with other states, Tamil Nadu faces the problem of assessing return flows from&#13;
irrigated command areas. Pilot studies would be carried out on selected irrigation command areas.&#13;
This study proposal needs detailed development and, pending this, a lump sum provision of Rs. 5.0&#13;
million has been made in the project cost estimates.&#13;
F. Real-Time Water Resources Management&#13;
Improved Flood Forecasting&#13;
32.   The Tambraparani river system experiences floods, usually during the north-east monsoon&#13;
from October to December. The latest major flood in 1992 affected some 500,000 people and caused&#13;
severe damage to the area. The time of concentration of the flood is approximately 24 hours. A&#13;
communication system for the basin will be provided under the project, consisting of 16 VHF radio&#13;
sets. In addition, a consultancy input of nine person months will be provided for training in&#13;
catchment modelling.&#13;
G. Institutional Strengthening&#13;
General&#13;
33.    Institutional performance needs to be strengthened for data collection, validation, storage&#13;
and dissemination. Appropriate skills will have to be developed to operate the computing and&#13;
laboratory facilities provided under the project and to maintain the improved hydrometric networks.&#13;
A high level of inter-agency coordination will be required for development of computerized data&#13;
banks which are inter-active and accessible between data centers and can be accessed by other public&#13;
and private entities.&#13;
34.   The project would finance incremental project staff and other inputs to support new&#13;
institutional initiatives intended to implement the project and to ensure its sustainability into the&#13;
future. The latter would include: office buildings, equipment and services; consultant services;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
249&#13;
Annex 25&#13;
Page 7&#13;
project specific staff training; and vehicles and their operational costs. Support for selection of&#13;
specialized equipment and computing facilities and software, and for training of the state agency staff&#13;
will be provided, as appropriate, by CWC, CGWB, NIH, CWPRS, IMD and the retained&#13;
consultants of the project.&#13;
Proposed Organizational Setup&#13;
35.    As noted (para 3), a new WRD will be established under the Bank supported WRCP. The&#13;
WRD will be headed by an Engineer-in-Chief (EIC) who will be assisted by four functional CEs&#13;
(Plan Formulation, Design and Construction, Operation and Maintenance, and Hydrology and four&#13;
Basin Managers of CE rank. The CE (Hydrology) will be responsible for both surface water and&#13;
groundwater data collection and management and resource evaluation. Surface water data collection&#13;
will be the responsibility of a circle comprising four field divisions, headed by an SE. The&#13;
groundwater data collection unit in WRD will comprise the existing three groundwater Circles, each&#13;
headed by an SE, and they will be responsible for field operations and control of the ten field&#13;
Divisions. A Chief Chemist at the Madras laboratory will control the laboratories at Madurai, Tiruchi&#13;
and Pollachi. An SE in Madras will manage the separate surface water and groundwater data&#13;
centers.&#13;
Office Buildings and Equipment - State Agency&#13;
36.   The state surface water and groundwater data centers will be established in the headquarters&#13;
of WRD in Madras. They will require upgrading of an existing office facility, which will be&#13;
provided and furnished under the project. Provision is also made for construction and furnishings of&#13;
four Divisional Offices, 16 Subdivisional Offices and 60 Section Offices for surface water&#13;
operations.&#13;
Vehicles - State Agency&#13;
37.   The surface water data collection activities would require a total of 25 vehicles as follows: 20&#13;
jeeps for supervision of WRD river gauging stations, four jeeps to be attached to the laboratories,&#13;
and one minibus to be used for training activities. The package of reservoir sedimentation survey&#13;
equipment would include one jeep and one lorry (para 29). The groundwater data collection&#13;
activities would require 25 jeeps for field operations and four jeeps for the laboratories. Two saloon&#13;
cars will be provided for use by the CE (Hydrology) and the SE in-charge of the data centers.&#13;
Training - State Agency (Annex 11)&#13;
38.   Surface Water Training Activities. The following will be the main subjects of training under&#13;
the project: (a) training of stream gauging staff and junior supervisory staff in the technology of&#13;
hydrometry and maintenance of instruments and ancillary equipment; (b) training of field level staff&#13;
in sampling technology for sediment sampling and in sediment analyses; (c) training in water&#13;
sampling and on-site analyses; (d) training of junior profession staff of the laboratories in the use of&#13;
specialized laboratory equipment; and (e) training of professional staff in the state surface water data&#13;
center, in the field Hydrology Divisions and Subdivisions and in the laboratories in the use of&#13;
computers for hydrological data processing and for other software applications. Essentially, all this&#13;
training will be carried out in-house within WRD through appropriate training courses (some using&#13;
WALMI facilities), and on-the-job training. However, in order to implement in-house training&#13;
courses, it will be necessary to train selected staff from WRD to be trainers, and this training of&#13;
trainers will be implemented with the assistance of NIH and CWC. Consultants will be retained&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
250&#13;
Annex 25&#13;
Page 8&#13;
under the project to provide oversight and advice on the design, context and implementation of these&#13;
training activities.&#13;
39.   Additional to the above training which relates to basic data collection and data management&#13;
systems, senior professional staff of the surface water data center will be provided with training in&#13;
analytical hydrology and advanced computer software applications through training courses run by&#13;
NIH in Roorkee and post-graduate training in Indian universities. Senior staff of the laboratories&#13;
will be provided with training in interpretation of water quality data. Study tours abroad will be&#13;
provided to observe appropriate hydrometric, water quality monitoring and data management&#13;
systems.&#13;
40.   Hydrometeorological Observation Training. The hydrometeorological observation networks&#13;
maintained by WRD would be improved under the project. While the expansion element of the&#13;
program is limited, improvement of the performance of the network would be an important activity.&#13;
This will involve training of observers in the proper performance at their duties, including&#13;
maintenance of instruments. The training will be undertaken through the Madras regional office of&#13;
IMD. Training of supervisors and advanced training in meteorology will be provided by IMD's&#13;
training facility in Pune.&#13;
41.   Groundwater Training Activities. The main subjects of groundwater training under the&#13;
project will be: (a) training of field staff in manual water level observations, water quality sampling,&#13;
use of field measuring equipment (biaxial electric tapes, EC meters, pH meters), and servicing of&#13;
digital water level recorders; (b) training of junior technical staff in the laboratories in the use of&#13;
advanced equipment; and (c) training of professionals in the state groundwater data center and in the&#13;
field offices in the use of computer software for hydrological processing and other software&#13;
applications. This training will be provided through the National Groundwater Training Institute to&#13;
be established by CGWB in Raipur, with junior technical staff trained through courses run using&#13;
WALMI facilities. The suppliers of digital water level recorders will be required to provide training&#13;
in servicing and maintenance of the equipment. Retained consultants will provide oversight and&#13;
advice for the training programs.&#13;
42.   The above training all relates to basic data collection and data management systems. In&#13;
addition, senior professional staff from the groundwater data center will be provided with training in&#13;
advanced hydrogeological analysis techniques, including computer modeling, through training&#13;
courses run by NIH in Roorkee and post-graduate training in Indian universities. The senior staff of&#13;
the laboratories will receive advanced training in interpretation of groundwater quality data. Study&#13;
tours abroad will be provided to observe appropriate groundwater monitoring networks and data&#13;
management systems.&#13;
43.   Training Cost Estimates. Quantities, cost estimates and timing for surface water,&#13;
groundwater, water quality and meteorology related training activities are shown in Table 1.&#13;
Staff Requirements and Costs.&#13;
44.   The establishment of a free standing State Water Resources Data Centre with the necessary&#13;
field organization for data collection will be undertaken by WRD. Most of the staff for the&#13;
groundwater activities are in place, but some expansion of the surface water field operations will be&#13;
necessary. Many of the new staff posts will be filled by re-deployment from within WRD.&#13;
However, some specialized professional posts (chemists, experienced computer specialists) will&#13;
have to be filled by new recruitment. The estimated costs of incremental staff salaries and allowances&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
251&#13;
Annex 25&#13;
Page 9&#13;
for the Water Resources Data Centre and the laboratories and field support staff are estimated to be&#13;
about Rs.92 million over the six year period (average of Rs.15.3 M/yr).&#13;
Hydrological Services and Interaction with Data User Agencies&#13;
45.   A basic concept of the project is that hydrological data collection and its management and&#13;
dissemination should be regarded as a service to the public at large. Thus, all legitimate users of the&#13;
data should have clearly defined and easily acquired access to the data. Moreover, the data collected&#13;
should be made available in formats that are useful to the users. In many cases, the publication of&#13;
data summaries in the form of year books would suffice. Groundwater data often requires&#13;
interpretation in the form of maps and explanatory reports. Some users may require the original data,&#13;
and this could be provided as printouts or on floppy disks. The possibility of payment for such&#13;
services should be considered.&#13;
46.   Arranging access for interested government agencies should not present difficulties.&#13;
Provision of easy access to the data bases for legitimate private entities might be a problem. It is&#13;
proposed that a committee of interested data users should be established in the state. This would give&#13;
prominence to the availability of the data, reveal the demand for the type of data required and the&#13;
format of its presentation, and give direction for improvements to the hydrological service.&#13;
H. Procurement&#13;
47.   General. The procurement arrangements for the project are described in paras 4.03-4.07 and&#13;
detailed in Annex 13b. All procurement would follow the standard procurement documentation&#13;
approved by the World Bank for works, goods and services&#13;
48.   Works. The works to be implemented for the surface water component consist of buildings&#13;
and small structures for hydrological and hydrometeorological stations. These will be implemented&#13;
by LCB contracts according to Bank guidelines or force account, as appropriate. The major works&#13;
element under the groundwater component will be construction of observation tubewells. Most will&#13;
be procured by LCB contracts with local drilling companies, but the wells with more difficult&#13;
designs will be constructed with WRD's own drilling rigs under force account.&#13;
49.   Goods. Implementation of the project will involve procurement of large quantities of&#13;
specialized hydrometric equipment, some specialized survey and laboratory equipment, and&#13;
computer hardware and software. These items will be procured by ICB as described in para 4.04 of&#13;
the SAR. The office equipment will be procured by LCB or by prudent shopping procedures. The&#13;
vehicles for the first year will be procured by prudent shopping from the manufacturers according to&#13;
Government standard rate contracts. Procurement of vehicles in subsequent years will be by ICB or&#13;
by prudent shopping procedures, according to the size of the procurement package.&#13;
50.   Services. Consultant services will be procured by Central Government according to Bank&#13;
guidelines for foreign and local consultants. NICNET services will be provided according to&#13;
negotiated charges and fees arranged by Central Government. All other services will be provided by&#13;
the concerned agencies through force account procedures.&#13;
I. Project Coordination. Monitoring and Evaluation and Review&#13;
PrQjec Coordination&#13;
51.   A State Project Coordination Group will be established in the WRD, reporting to the&#13;
Secretary of the Department, to coordinate project activities in Tamil Nadu (SAR, para 5.18). An&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
252&#13;
Annex 25&#13;
Page 10&#13;
important function of the group will be liaison with the central and local offices of CWC, CGWB&#13;
and IMD, and with any other agencies (NIH, CWPRS) which are implementing project programs in&#13;
the State. The Project Coordination Group will also have the responsibility for project monitoring&#13;
and evaluation and project annual reviews as described below.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
52.   The monitoring and evaluation of this structurally complex project in Tamil Nadu will be&#13;
carried out by the State Project Coordination Group. The exercise will cover both project&#13;
implementation progress and the performance of the data collection and management systems&#13;
developed. The results of monitoring and evaluation will be reported in semi-annual progress reports&#13;
and form a basis for the annual implementation reviews (para 53).&#13;
PrQJect Annual Reviews&#13;
53.   Project Annual Reviews. Semi-annual progress reports will be prepared for the state by the&#13;
State Project Coordination Group and submitted to the Central Project Coordinating Secretariat for&#13;
inclusion in the project semi-annual progress reports. An annual implementation review of the&#13;
project will be undertakenunder the guidance of the Central Coordinating Committee with the Bank&#13;

HYDROLOGY PROJECT&#13;
Programs in Kerala&#13;
1.    Introduction. The state of Kerala has a land area of about 38,860 km2 and the population&#13;
was around 29 million in 1989. It lies on the west coast of India and at the southern end of the&#13;
peninsular. Most of this elongated state is formed by the Westem Ghats with a narrow and&#13;
discontinuous coastal plain fringing the Arabian Sea. Rainfall ranges from about 2,000 mm/yr&#13;
adjacent to the coast to more than 4,000 mm/yr on the crest of the Ghats and averages about 3,000&#13;
mm/yr on the state area. The rainfall occurs mainly during the south-west monsoon from May to&#13;
September and the north-east monsoon from October to December, but short duration storms are&#13;
fairly common during the relatively dry months of January to April. Most of the state is drained&#13;
westwards to the Arabian Sea by 44 relatively small river systems which originate on the&#13;
uppermost slopes of the Westem Ghats. A small part of the eastward draining Cauvery basin lies&#13;
within Kerala.&#13;
2.    Section A of this annex describes the existing systems for hydrological data collection and&#13;
data management; Section B describes the proposed improvements to the observation systems;&#13;
Section C discusses the establishment of computerized data management facilities and their&#13;
associated communication systems; Section D covers institutional strengthening activities; Section&#13;
E refers to procurement procedures; and Section F summarizes arrangements for project&#13;
performance monitoring and evaluation and for the project review process. Detailed cost estimate&#13;
for the activities of the concemed state agencies are shown by Table 1.&#13;
A. Existing Systems for Hvdrological Observations and Data Management&#13;
Surface Water (SW) Hydrology&#13;
3.    Organizational Setup. Kerala state's surface water hydrological data collection and&#13;
management is carried out by a circle within the jurisdiction of the Chief Engineer (Planning,&#13;
Investigation and Design) in the Irrigation Department (ID) who reports to the Secretary to the&#13;
Minister of Irrigation of the Govemment of Kerala. The Hydrology Circle, with headquarters at&#13;
Trissur, contains two river gauging Divisions located at Calicut and Adook, each of which control&#13;
three Subdivisional offices with three section offices under each Subdivision. The CWC's surface&#13;
water gauging network in Kerala is managed by the Westem Rivers Division (located at Cochin) of&#13;
the Cauvery and Southern Rivers Circle (with a headquarters in Bangalore) which reports to the&#13;
CE, Southern Region in Coimbatore.&#13;
4.    River Gauging Stations. The Hydrology Circle of the Kerala ID operates 70 river gauging&#13;
stations where stage levels are measured and discharge is estimated by slope area methodology&#13;
involving float velocity measurements. Sediment load and water quality are not monitored on a&#13;
routine basis. The CWC operates 19 stage/discharge stations in Kerala with sediment load&#13;
measured at 16 sites and water quality monitored at 19 sites.&#13;
5.    Laboratory Facilities. The surface water hydrology unit of Kerala ID does not at present&#13;
monitor water quality and therefore has no laboratory facilities. The water samples collected by the&#13;
Western Rivers Division of CWC are analyzed at site laboratories for parameters with unstable&#13;
characteristics and in the Coimbatore Divisional laboratory for more complete analyses.&#13;
6.    Data Processing and Management. Discharge measurements are made by technicians of the&#13;
hydrology unit of Kerala ID with initial computations being made at site. However, unlike most&#13;
other states, the gauging stations are manned only by stage observers with discharge being&#13;
&#13;

estimated by visiting crews. Data verification is carried out at Section and Subdivision levels.&#13;
Data storage is at present on paper files. Data collected from the CWC observation sites are&#13;
processed and stored according to the Commission's standard procedures (Annex 15).&#13;
Groundwater (GW) Hydrology&#13;
7.    Organizational Setup. The State Groundwater Department (SGD) of Kerala is a free-&#13;
standing organization under a Director of CE rank who reports directly to the Secretary to the&#13;
Minister of Inrigation.With headquarters in Trivandrum, it comprises a Hydrogeological Circle and&#13;
an Engineering Circle together with headquarters units responsible for administration and finance,&#13;
and operates through multipurpose offices located in the district headquarters of all 14 districts of&#13;
the state. The CGWB has a Regional Office in Trivandrum with responsibility for the Board's&#13;
activities in Kerala.&#13;
8.    Groundwater Monitoring Networks. The SGD has established an observation network&#13;
comprising only 206 hand-dug wells tapping the phreatic aquifer systems.  Water level&#13;
observations are made only once each year at the end of the dry season, and samples are then also&#13;
taken for water quality analyses. The existing monitoring network is inadequate in terms of both&#13;
density and frequency of water level measurements. The CGWB maintains an observation&#13;
network of 625 dug wells in the phreatic aquifers, 16 piezometers in sedimentary areas and ten&#13;
piezometers in hard rock areas, the last tapping only the phreatic zone. There are five automatic&#13;
water level recorders installed on piezometers. Otherwise, water levels are measured manually&#13;
during fixed ten-day periods four times each year (January, May, August, November). Samples&#13;
are taken for water quality analyses once each year at the time of the May water level measurement&#13;
9.    Laboratory Facilities. The SGD now operates only one laboratory located at Trivandrum&#13;
which requires upgrading in terms of both building and equipment. The CGWB Regional Office&#13;
has a laboratoiy equipped to about Level II+ standard, but much of the equipment is old, of poor&#13;
serviceability and requires replacement.&#13;
10.   Data Processing and Management. The data collected by SGD is presently stored on paper&#13;
files. The CGWB Regional Office was equipped with computer hardware and software with some&#13;
peripheral in a Swedish technical assistance project which closed in 1988. But much of the&#13;
equipment is now unserviceable or requiring maintenance/spares. Nevertheless, the water level&#13;
and water quality data bases have been computerized.&#13;
Hydrometeorology&#13;
11.   Organizational Setup. In common with all the states of India, several agencies of the&#13;
Kerala State government maintain networks of rainfall observation stations, and some have climatic&#13;
stations. These include the Revenue Department (RD), the Department of Agriculture (DOA) and&#13;
the ID. In addition, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the CWC maintain small&#13;
networks of rainfall and climatic stations in Kerala.&#13;
12.   Hydrometeorological Networks. The total number of rainfall stations in Kerala is 229.&#13;
The ID maintains 82 stations equipped with standard rain gauges. The [MD operates 70 stations of&#13;
which 60 have SRGs and 10 are FCSs. The CWC manages 19 stations which are partially&#13;
equipped climatic stations. The remaining 87 stations are managed by other govemment agencies&#13;
and some tea estates.&#13;
13.   Data Processing and Management. Computers are not used for storage and management of&#13;
rainfall and other climatic data collected by state agencies, apart from the selected data archived by&#13;
IMD. The CWC data resides at the Cochin Divisional Office and is not computerized. The IMD&#13;
computerizes the data from its own stations and approved stations of other agencies in Kerala at its&#13;
&#13;

establish a Level II laboratory at the Hydrology Circle Office in Trissur. The project will also&#13;
establish ten Level I laboratories at selected river gauging sites, each laboratory handling samples&#13;
from about three adjacent sites.&#13;
Groundwater Hydrology&#13;
16.   Upgrading of Data Collection Infrastructure. The SGD network of observation will&#13;
increase from 206 wells that are monitored at present to 565 locations under the project. The&#13;
network will comprise 206 dug wells in the phreatic aquifer system which will be monitored for&#13;
water levels at monthly intervals, 290 tubewells in the depth range 30-120m in hard rock of which&#13;
241 will be equipped with digital water level recorders, 59 tubewells in the depth range 30-200 m&#13;
in sedimentary formations which will be equipped with digital water level recorders, and ten&#13;
tubewells about 60 m deep in sedimentary formations which will be installed for pollution/water&#13;
quality monitoring (Table 1). Thus, some 300 wells in the SGD network will be equipped with&#13;
digital water level recorders.&#13;
17.   The CGWB Regional Office network in Kerala will increase from 651 sites that are&#13;
monitored at present to 766 sites under the project. The network will comprise 500 existing open&#13;
wells which will be monitored four times each year, 26 existing tubewells of which five are&#13;
equipped with automatic water level recorders and 21 are measured four times each year, 175 new&#13;
tubewells in hard rock in the depth range 30-120 m of which 105 will be equipped with digital&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
262&#13;
Annex 26&#13;
Page 4&#13;
water level recorders, 45 new tubewells in sedimentary formation in the depth range 30-350 m&#13;
which will be equipped with digital water level recorders, and ten new tubewells of about 60 m&#13;
depth which will be installed for pollution/water quality monitoring. Thus, some 150 observation&#13;
sites will be equipped with digital water level recorders. Reference should be made to Annex 4 for&#13;
more detailed discussion of the groundwater network improvements.&#13;
18.   Improved Laboratory Facilities. The water quality monitoring workload is expected to&#13;
increase substantially for the SGD, and both SGD and CGWB will place greater emphasis on&#13;
pollution monitoring studies. The existing SGD laboratory at Trivandrum will be upgraded to&#13;
Level II+ and provided with a new building. The regional offices to be established in Emakulam&#13;
and Calicut will be provided with a laboratory building which will be equipped to Level II&#13;
standard. The CGWB Regional Office laboratory will be upgraded to Level II+ standard. Details&#13;
of the equipment to be provided and the analyses to be carried out by each type of laboratory&#13;
facility are discussed in Annex 5.&#13;
Hydrometeorology&#13;
19.   Improvements to Observation Network. The Kerala ID's network will be improved by the&#13;
installation of 30 SRGs, 20 ARGs and nine FCSs. A lump sum provision is made for replacement&#13;
of defective and missing equipment at the existing ID observation sites. The SGD will be provided&#13;
with eight FCSs to be installed at their district offices where this type of information is not&#13;
available in the vicinity.&#13;
C. Improvements to Data Management and Communication Systems&#13;
Upgrading of Data Management Systems&#13;
20.   General. Separate state data centers will be established for surface water and groundwater&#13;
information with the ID hydrology unit (Figure 1) and in the SGD (Figure 2) respectively. The&#13;
surface water data center will be a unit under the CE (Planning, Investigators and Design) and&#13;
located in Trivandrum. The groundwater data center will be created with the headquarters of the&#13;
SGD at Trivandrum. As noted (para 3), CWC's stream gauging and hydrometeorological&#13;
networks in Kerala are managed by a Division based on Cochin where data will accumulate in&#13;
computerized format before being transferred to the Circle Office in Bangalore and the Regional&#13;
Office in Coimbatore. The CGWB Regional Office at Trivandrum will establish a groundwater&#13;
data bankl for information collected by the Board in Kerala. Reference should be made to Annex 7&#13;
for detailed discussions of the data management and data transfer systems.&#13;
21.   Checking and Entry of Historical Data into Computer Storage. This section refers mainly&#13;
to surface water flow data collected by the hydrology unit of ID. All that data is now on paper&#13;
files. Although much of the data may be of doubtful quality, it is all that is now available and it&#13;
must be stored in computers for use until along series of higher validity data is available.&#13;
Nevertheless, some validation must be made to remove obvious anomalies before data are entered&#13;
into storage or, alternatively, a computer routine could be used to recognize and eliminate&#13;
anomalies after data entry. It is evident that this process will be very subjective and will require&#13;
care in application. The next opportunity to review the historical data will occur when a validated&#13;
data series has been developed through project activities at stable sites where a secure rating curve&#13;
can be obtained. If comparison of the historical flow data with the rating curve reveals a systematic&#13;
en-or in the discharge measurements, it will then be possible to correct the site historical data series.&#13;
22.   State Surface Water Manaeement System. The data collected from the gauging sites by&#13;
supervisors from Section Offices then accumulates for validation at the six Subdivisional Offices.&#13;
The Subdivisional Offices will be provided with computer packages Type D comprising: two&#13;
personal computers (486 sx) and two dot matrix printers plus two UPSs, associated office&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

furniture and an air conditioner, together with software for the surface water data system and a&#13;
general purpose package. Thus, after verification, data will be entered into computer storage at the&#13;
Subdivisions. Computer packages Type D with ancillaries and software listed above will be&#13;
provided for the three Divisional Offices and at the Circle Office. Transfer of data to the higher&#13;
level offices and to the surface water date center in Trivandrum will be by floppy disk or by a dial-&#13;
up NICNET connection. The laboratory at the Circle Office in Trissur will enter its data into the D&#13;
type computing facility provided for that office, and for this purpose, it will be provided with a&#13;
water quality data software package. The transfer of water quality data from the laboratory to the&#13;
surface water data center will be by floppy disk or through the Circles' dial-up NICNET&#13;
connection. The state surface water data center will be provided with a computer package Type B&#13;
comprising: a file saver (486dx2, EISA), five personal computers (486 dx2), two laser printers, a&#13;
dot matrix printer, a plotter and a digitizer, together with six UPSs, a generator, two air&#13;
conditioners, a fax machine, a photocopier and office fumiture. Software provided will include:&#13;
the surface water and water quality data systems, an appropriate hydrological package, a general&#13;
purpose package, and a network package.&#13;
23.   State Groundwater Management System. The 14 District Offices of SGD will be provided&#13;
with computer packages Type D plus ancillaries and software for the groundwater data system and&#13;
general purposes (para 22). Storage of data after verification will be initiated at this level. The&#13;
three Regional Offices of SGD will also be provided with computer packages Type D andGW data&#13;
system and general purpose software. The laboratories at Trivandrum, Calicut and Emakulam will&#13;
be provided with Type D computer packages with water quality data system and general purpose&#13;
software. The GW data center at Trivandrum will be provided with computer package Type B&#13;
(para 22) together with software for the groundwater and water quality data systems, an&#13;
appropriate hydrogeological package, a general purpose package and a network package. Transfer&#13;
of data from the District Offices to the Regional Offices and to the data center, and from the&#13;
laboratories to the data center will be by floppy disk or by dial-up NICNET connections.&#13;
24.   CWC Divisional Office Data management System. The CWC Divisional Office at Cochin&#13;
will be provided with a computer package type D together with the software for the surface water&#13;
data system and general purposes. The three Subdivisions of the Cochin Division will be provided&#13;
with similar type D computer packages, and data entry will be initiated at the Subdivisional level&#13;
with data transfer to the Divisional Office by floppy disk.&#13;
25.   CGWB Regional Office Data_Management System. The Regional Office in Trivandrum&#13;
will be provided with a computer package Type B (para 22). The software packages provided will&#13;
include: the groundwater and water quality data systems, an appropriate hydrogeological package,&#13;
a general purpose package, and a network package.&#13;
26.   IMD Data Management System. The IMD Meteorological Center in Trivandrum will be&#13;
provided with a computer package type C and appropriate software to manage the rainfall and&#13;
climatic data generated by the ID. Transfer of data from the surface water data center to the&#13;
meteorological center will be by floppy disk.&#13;
Communication System between Data Banks&#13;
27.   The Kerala ID's surface water data center should be able to exchange data with CWC's&#13;
Divisional Office in Cochin. This could be achieved by transfers on floppy disks. Similarly, the&#13;
state groundwater data center and the CGWB Regional Office data center must be interactive&#13;
through a communication system allowing unrestricted access. As both data centers will be in&#13;
Trivandrum, the required level of communication could be achieved by a telephone land line&#13;
through the local NIC facility.&#13;
28.   It will be necessary to transfer the SW data collected in Kerala by the ID hydrology unit and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
264&#13;
Annex 26&#13;
Page 6&#13;
the CWC to the central surface water data bank to be established at the CWC Headquarters in New&#13;
Delhi. Similarly, the state ground water data center and CGWB's Regional Office data center must&#13;
be able to communicate with the central groundwater data banking system to be established at the&#13;
CGWB Headquarters in Faridabad. NICNET ground stations will be provided for the central&#13;
surface water data center in New Delhi and for the central groundwater data center in Faridabad.&#13;
The Kerala ID's data banking system will be provided with a NICNET modem with dedicated land&#13;
line for transfer and exchange of data with the central surface water data center. The CWC&#13;
Southern Region Office in Coimbatore, which controls the Cochin Division of CWC, will also&#13;
have a NICNET modem for transfer of data collected within its jurisdiction to the central surface&#13;
water data center at CWC Headquarters, New Delhi. As the state groundwater data center and the&#13;
CGWB Regional Office data center will be connected to NIC, Trivandrum by dedicated land line to&#13;
the local NICNET ground station, and the NICNET facility will be used for transfer and exchange&#13;
of data with the central groundwater data bank in CGWB Headquarters, Faridabad.&#13;
D. Reservoir Sedimentation Surveys&#13;
29.   Reservoir sedimentation surveys are included under the project because the work is given&#13;
high priority by the concerned central and state agencies. To facilitate this work, the project would&#13;
provide Kerala ID with one set of specialized equipment comprising: 25 ft/40 HP boat with trailer,&#13;
a satellite trisnonder position system, a distomat electronic measurer, an echotrac echosounder,&#13;
general survey equipment, walkie-talkie radio sets, digital planimeters, and sediment sampling and&#13;
analysis sets. One jeep and one lorry will be provided with the equipment set. A D type computer&#13;
package will be supplied for calculations and graphics. With the equipment provided, it should be&#13;
possible to survey about 20 reservoirs every five years.&#13;
E. FloodForecg&#13;
30.   To enhance the flood forecasting capability of Kerala ID, the project will provide 17&#13;
wireless sets for transmission of real-time data from selected locations on flood-prone river&#13;
systems.&#13;
F. Institutional Strengthening&#13;
31.   General. The institutional performance of the Kerala ID and SGD needs to be strengthened&#13;
for data collection, validation, storage and dissemination. Appropriate skills have to be developed&#13;
to operate the computing and laboratory facilities provided under the project, and to operate and&#13;
maintain the improved hydrometric networks. A high level of inter-agency coordination will be&#13;
necessary for development of computerized data banks which are inter-active and accessible&#13;
between data centers and which can be accessed by other public and private entities.&#13;
32.   The project would finance incremental staff and other inputs to support new institutional&#13;
initiatives intended to implement the project and to ensure its sustainability into the future. The&#13;
latter would include: office buildings, equipment and services; consultant services; project specific&#13;
staff training; and vehicles and their operational costs. In addition, support for selection of&#13;
specialized equipment, computing facilities and software selection, and for training of state agency&#13;
staff will be provided, as appropriate, by CWC, CGWB, NIH, CWPRS, IMD and the retained&#13;
consultants of the project.&#13;
Office Buildings and Equipment and State Agencies&#13;
33.   The project will finance a new headquarters for the Kerala ID surface water unit (Rs. 4.5&#13;
million) and buildings for 15 new river gauging stations. The project will also finance the costs of&#13;
a headquarters building for SGD in Trivandrum, two regional offices at Calicut and Ernakulam&#13;
respectively, and 18 officer quarters distributed between the above locations (Rs. 54.7 million).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
265&#13;
Annex 26&#13;
Page 7&#13;
Allowances are also made in the project budget for office equipment and furnishings for the above&#13;
buildings additional to the computing facilities mentioned in paras 22 and 23.&#13;
34.   Computers for Administration and Management. As noted (paras 22, 23), the computing&#13;
facilities provided to the ID and GWD for data management will include a general purpose package&#13;
among the software. This software is intended primarily for administration purposes.&#13;
35.   Vehicles. TheSW data collection and management activities will require some 16 vehicles&#13;
distributed as follows: one saloon car for the surface water data center, eight jeeps for supervision&#13;
of the gauging stations, three jeeps for working with the boat outfits with trailers, one lorry and&#13;
one jeep for the sedimentation survey operations, one jeep for the laboratory, and one minibus for&#13;
training activities. The groundwater data collection and management activities will be provided&#13;
with 21 vehicles distributed as follows: one saloon car for the groundwater data center, fourteen&#13;
jeeps for the district offices, three jeeps for the regional offices, and three jeeps for the laboratories.&#13;
Training&#13;
36.   SW  Training Activities. The objectives, procedures and management arrangements for&#13;
training are discussed in Annex 10. The following will be the main subjects of training under the&#13;
project: (a) training of stream gauging staff and supervisory staff in the technology of hydrometry;&#13;
(b) training of field level staff in sampling technology for sediment observations and in sediment&#13;
analyses and in water quality sampling and on-site analyses; (c) training of junior professional staff&#13;
of the laboratories in the use of specialized equipment; and (d) training of junior professionals in&#13;
the state surface water data center, the field units of the Hydrology Circle and the laboratory in the&#13;
use of computers for hydrological data processing and other software applications. Much of this&#13;
training will be carried out as an in-house activity of the ID through appropriate training courses&#13;
and on-the-job training. In order to implement the in-house training courses, it will be necessary to&#13;
select staff from the Hydrology Unit to be trained as trainers. The training of trainers will be&#13;
implemented with the assistance of NIH.  Consultant services retained under the project&#13;
specifically for training would provide oversight and advice on the design, content and&#13;
implementation of the training activities.&#13;
37.   Additional to the above described training which all relates to basic data generation and data&#13;
management systems, more senior professional staff of the hydrology unit will be provided with&#13;
training in analytical hydrology and advanced computer software applications through training&#13;
courses run by NIH and post-graduate training in Indian universities and foreign institutions.&#13;
Study tours abroad will be provided to observe appropriate hydrometric and data management&#13;
systems. Senior professionals from the laboratories will also be provided with advanced training&#13;
in appropriate Indian and foreign institutions.&#13;
38.   Hydrometeorological Observation Training. The hydrometeorological observation network&#13;
maintained by the ID will be upgraded and expanded under the project and a number of FCSs will&#13;
be provided to SGD (para 19). This will involve training of the observers in the proper&#13;
performance of their duties, including maintenance of instruments. The ID staff involved in&#13;
supervision of the networks will also require training, and some more advanced training in&#13;
hydrometeorological applications relating to hydrology will be provided to more senior staff of&#13;
ID's hydrology unit. The observatory staff training will be provided by IMD at its Madras&#13;
Training Centre while the supervisor staff and senior staff will be trained through courses run&#13;
under IMD's training establishment at Pune (Annex 19).&#13;
39.   Groundwater Training Activities. The expansion of SGD's groundwater observation&#13;
network, the introduction of digital water level recorder, the establishment of a computerized&#13;
system for data management, and the provision of laboratory facilities will involve staff training.&#13;
The main subjects of groundwater training under the project will be: (a) training of SGD field staff&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
266&#13;
Annex 26&#13;
Page 8&#13;
in manual water level observation, water quality sampling, use of field measuring equipment&#13;
(biaxial electri tapes, EC meters, pH meters, etc.), and servicing of digital water level recorders;&#13;
(b) training of junior professional staff of the laboratories in the use of specialized laboratory&#13;
equipment; and (c) training of professionals in the state groundwater data center and the regional&#13;
and distrcffices in the use of computers for data processing and other software applications.&#13;
This training will be provided through the National Groundwater Training Institute to be&#13;
established by CGWB at Raipur, with the junior technical staff training for groundwater&#13;
observations carried out using WALMI facilities. The suppliers of digital water level recorders will&#13;
be required to provide training on servicing and maintenance of the equipment.&#13;
40.   The above training relates to basic data collection and data management systems. In&#13;
addition, senior professional staff of SGD will be provided with training in advanced&#13;
hydrogeolo,gical analysis techniques, including computer modelling, and hydrochemistry through&#13;
training cou=es run by NIH in Roorkee and in Indian universities and foreign institutions. Study&#13;
tours abroad will be provided to observe appropriate groundwater monitoring networks and data&#13;
management systems.&#13;
41.   Trainiine Cost Estimates. Quantities, cost estimates and timings for training activities are&#13;
shown by Tahle 1.&#13;
Staff Requirements and Incremental Costs - State Agencies&#13;
42.   The creation of the state surface water data center and the establishment of a laboratory for&#13;
suiface water analyses will require additional professional staff. And the vehicles provided to ID&#13;
will require drivers. However, the establishment for surface water activities will be provided from&#13;
the existing staff or by redeployment.&#13;
43.   The SGD will have to employ additional specialists for the groundwater data center and the&#13;
laboratories. The creation of three Regional Offices will require some additional staff posts which&#13;
will be filled by new employments, promotions or transfers. Drivers will have to be employed for&#13;
the vehicles provided under the project. The estimated annual costs of salaries and allowances for&#13;
incremental staff are about Rs. 2.0 million.&#13;
Hydrological Services and Interaction with Data User Agencies&#13;
44.   A project concept is that hydrological data collection and its management and dissemination&#13;
should be regarded as a public service. Thus all legitimate data users should have clearly defined&#13;
and easily acquired access to the data. Moreover, the data collected should be made available in&#13;
formats that are useful to the users. In many cases, publication of data summaries and/or&#13;
yearbooks would suffice. Groundwater data often requires interpretation in the form of maps and&#13;
explanatory reports. Some users may require the original data, and this could be provided as a&#13;
printout or on flopping disks. The possibility of payment for such services should be considered.&#13;
45.   Arranging access for interested government agencies should not present difficulties.&#13;
Provision of easy access to legitimate private entities could be a problem. It is proposed that a&#13;
committee of interested data users should be established in the state. This would give prominence&#13;
to the availability of the data, reveal the demand for the type of data required and the form of its&#13;
presentation, and give direction for improvements to the hydrological service.&#13;
G. Procurement&#13;
46.   General. The procurement arrangements for the project are described in paras 4.03-4.07&#13;
and detailed in Annex 13b.  All procurement would follow  the standard procurement&#13;
documentation approved by the World Bank for works, goods and services.&#13;
&#13;

Annex 26&#13;
Page 9&#13;
47.   Works. The works to be implemented by ID consist of buildings and small structures for&#13;
hydrological and hydrometeorological stations. These will be implemented by LCB contracts&#13;
according to Bank guidelines or by force account, as appropriate. The major works element under&#13;
SGD will be construction of observation tubewells, most of which will be procured by LCB&#13;
contracts with local drilling companies, but the wells with more difficult designs will be&#13;
constructed with agency's own drilling rigs under force account. The SGD buildings for offices&#13;
and laboratories will be implemented by LCB contracts.&#13;
48.   Goods. Implementation of the project will involve procurement of large quantities of&#13;

H. Project Coordination. Monitoring and Evaluation and Review&#13;
50.   Project Coordination. A small Project Coordination Group will be established in the ID,&#13;
reporting to the Secretary of the department, to coordinate project activities implemented by the&#13;
surface water hydrology unit and by the SGD (SAR, paras 5.18, 5.20). An important function of&#13;
the group will be liaison with the central offices of CWC, CGWB and IMD and their offices in&#13;
Kerala and with other agencies which are also involved in project programs in the State (NIH and&#13;
CWPRS). The Project Coordination Group will also have the responsibility for project monitoring&#13;
and evaluation and for the project annual reviews as described below.&#13;
51.   Monitoring and Evaluation. The monitoring and evaluation of this structurally complex&#13;
project in Kerala will be carried out by the State Project Coordination Group (para 50). The&#13;
exercise will cover both project implementation progress and the performance of the data collection&#13;
and management systems developed. The results of the monitoring and evaluation will be reported&#13;
in semi-annual reports and form a basis for the annual implementation reviews (para 52).&#13;
52.   Project Annual Reviews. Project Annual Reviews. Semi-annual progress reports will be&#13;
prepared for the state by the State Project Coordination Group and submitted to the Central Project&#13;
Coordinating Secretariat for inclusion in the project semi-annual progress reports. An annual&#13;
implementation review of the project will be undertakenunder the guidance of the Central&#13;
Coordinating Committee with the Bank not later than December 31 each year. The annual review&#13;
arrangement will provide the flexibility required to amend the state program for the following fiscal&#13;
year to reflect performance in the past year, and to incorporate any lessons learned into the future&#13;
program. The State Coordinating Group will have responsibility for presentation of information on&#13;
the performance of Kerala's part of the program for the annual implementation review.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Hydrology Project will assist the
            Government of India (GOI) and the seven participating states
            to develop comprehensive, easily accessed and user friendly
            data bases covering all aspects of the hydrological cycle,
            including surface water and groundwater in terms of quantity
            and quality and climatic measurements, particularly of
            rainfall. The project supports the objectives of GOI's
            national water policy and the Bank's strategy for
            India's water sector and policy regarding water
            resources management. Special attention will be paid to
            standardization of criteria, processes and procedures for
            measurement of hydrological parameters and for storage and
            retrieval of information so that data series will be
            compatible and the data bases will be interactive. The
            project will be structured as a six-year operation and
            include support of: upgrading and expanding the physical
            infrastructure for all aspects of the collection, collation,
            processing and dissemination of hydrological and
            hydrometeorological data; provision of equipment and
            materials; institutional strengthening including technical
            assistance and training; and new buildings and incremental
            operating and maintenance costs.
