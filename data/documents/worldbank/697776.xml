FINANCIAL SECTOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE LOAN&#13;
TECHNICAL ANNEX&#13;
SECTION A: PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
I.    Background&#13;
1.    Following the debt crisis and the September 1982 nationalization of the banking&#13;
system'', the Mexican financial system entered a period of turmoil. The de la Madrid&#13;
administration, which entered office in December 1982, took steps to liberalize and&#13;
strengthen securities markets and consolidate the operations of the state-owned banks.&#13;
Despite these measures, the development of the financial system was hampered by forced&#13;
lending requirements and other non-market oriented practices. Mandatory lending&#13;
requirements, which represented more than 70% of bank deposits in 1985, resulted in active&#13;
disintermediation. Credits to the private sector, as a percentage of total bank credit, shrank&#13;
from 40% in 1982 to 25% in 1986. The development of the financial system was further&#13;
hampered by macroeconomic instability with high and variable rates of inflation, peaking at&#13;
159% in 1987.&#13;
2.    Financial Sector Reform and Privatization. The pace of financial sector reform and&#13;
development accelerated substantially in 1988, as the Mexican Government undertook a&#13;
series of efforts culminating in the re-privatization of the commercial banks in 1991-92. In&#13;
1988, with the support of the Financial Sector Adjustment Loan (FSAL), steps were taken to&#13;
deregulate interest rates on deposits, eliminate forced lending and reduce the role of special&#13;
trusts as intermediation channels for Government resources. A new legal structure for the&#13;
financial system was created in 1990 with the approval by the Mexican Congress of laws&#13;
governing commercial and development banks, financial groups, and auxiliary credit&#13;
institutions. The resulting system is a hybrid of the universal and multiple banking models2'&#13;
in which certain forms of intermediation may be undertaken both by a commercial bank and&#13;
its brokerage subsidiaries, while other services may be offered only through separately&#13;
capitalized subsidiaries. While offering potential economies of scope for the sector, the&#13;
Mexican hybrid system complicates consolidated risk management and reduces ownership&#13;
transparency. Nevertheless, with this legal framework in place, the stage was set for the re-&#13;
1/60 banks were nationalized in 1982 with only Citibank Mexico and Banco Obrero&#13;
remaining outside of state control. Eleven of these institutions were subsequently liquidated.&#13;
The remaining 49 banks were consolidated through merger into 18 institutions by 1986.&#13;
2'The universal banking model permits the full range of financial services to be offered under&#13;
one entity, while the multiple bank model allows banking and non-banking services to be offered&#13;
by separately capitalized subsidiaries under a holding company.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
privatization of the 18 commercial banks. During 1991-92, the Government received the&#13;
equivalent of US$ 12.4 billion from the privatization of these institutions.&#13;
3.    Reform also benefitted the development of non-banking services such as insurance,&#13;
securities trading, bonding, financial leasing, warehousing and factoring-'. Government&#13;
regulation of insurance premiums and policies was simplified, as well as the operations of&#13;
mutual funds. Prompted by the stock market crash of 1987, the main laws regulating the&#13;
Mexican capital markets were subject to major modifications. Increased confidence and&#13;
simplification of the administrative process were the major objectives of legal changes which&#13;
imposed tougher penalties for insider trading, granted authority to brokers to act as dealers&#13;
for their own accounts, and required more extensive use of external auditors. Legal reforms&#13;
also liberalized pricing (leasing, factoring, insurance and brokerage), permitted the offering&#13;
of new products (e.g. administration of individual retirement accounts) and rationalized&#13;
taxation policies for the financial sector as a whole.&#13;
4.    The GOM undertook reform of the national social security and pension systems&#13;
through creation of the Sistema de Ahorro para el Renro (Retirement Saving System or SAR)&#13;
in 1990. Under the SAR, employers are required to establish individual accounts at&#13;
commercial banks for each employee to which 2% of gross wages must be contributed each&#13;
pay period. To date, commercial banks have been restricted to provision of account&#13;
administration services: all funds accumulated in SAR accounts must be kept in a specific&#13;
Central Bank account paying no less than 2 percent in real terms.&#13;
5.    Public Investment Evaluation and Budgeting. Given the enormous need to increase&#13;
the quality and quantity of public investment, particularly in infrastructure, the GOM&#13;
undertook measures to improve the capacity for project evaluation and budgeting. In 1991,&#13;
the Investment Project Evaluation Unit was established under the Ministry of Programming&#13;
and Budget (SPP) to serve as adviser on issues of public investment. Following the merger&#13;
of SPP with SHCP, the Unit was renamed the Investment, Energy, and Industry Unit (IEIU)&#13;
and was given broader responsibilities in establishment of standards for project evaluation&#13;
inclusive or ex-post evaluations of all public investments and providing analytical support to&#13;
the Ministry of Finance. Critically, the IEIU was given a central role in coordinating project&#13;
evaluation activities throughout the federal government through an inter-agency roundtable.&#13;
One result of IEIU's new broader role was the publication of the official methodological&#13;
guide to project evaluation in the Diario Oficial on June 28, 1993.&#13;
6.    Benefits of Previous Reforms. Financial sector liberalization has achieved a&#13;
considerable measure of success in stabilizing domestic financial markets, thereby attracting&#13;
large inflows of foreign private savings and reversing years of capital flight. Net capital&#13;
inflows averaged over US$ 27 billion per annum during 1991-93, resulting in foreign&#13;
31 Factoring is the sale of receivables by a borrower to a factoring company. The factoring&#13;
company may issue bills of exchange to finance the purchase of receivable instruments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
3&#13;
currency reserves of over US$ 25 billion by the end of 1993. By 1993, private sector&#13;
lending comprised 86% of total bank assets, up from 25% in 1986 as discussed above.&#13;
Broad measures of monetarization in the economy also indicate the increasing depth of&#13;
financial markets: M4 as a percent of GDP rose from 35% in 1988 to over 45% in 1993.&#13;
II.   The Remaining Agenda&#13;
7.    Current Problems. Although the recent accomplishments of the Government in&#13;
financial sector reform have been significant, more needs to be done to ensure continued&#13;
investor and depositor confidence, increase the access of low-income groups to financial&#13;
services, improve efficiency of capital allocation and reduce overall systemic risk. The cost&#13;
of capital remains high. As of September 1994, prime borrowers paid banks nominal interest&#13;
rates of around 17% and small and medium-size firms paid over 24% (approximately 9% and&#13;
16% in real terms, respectively). These high rates restrict access to financial services,&#13;
especially for small enterprises and low income individuals.&#13;
8.    Securities markets are also characterized by high transactions costs and illiquidity.&#13;
Underlying the high cost of debt and equity financing are both macroeconomic factors such&#13;
as Mexican country and exchange rate risk as perceived by foreign investors, and&#13;
microeconomic factors in the legal, regulatory and supervisory systems, problems in the&#13;
public registries system, high operating costs of financial institutions, a lack of adequate&#13;
competition -- particularly in the provision of banking services -- and the rising level of&#13;
commercial bank overdue loans4'.&#13;
9.    Another reason for the relative underdevelopment of Mexico's securities and capital&#13;
markets is the lack of a large base of institutional investors. Indicators of market&#13;
development such as insurance penetration, insurance density, and pension fund provision, as&#13;
well as broader measures such as market capitalization and the value of privately issued debt&#13;
obligations, highlight this problem. These indicators of Mexico's capital market development&#13;
not only lag other NAFTA countries and key emerging economies in Asia, but also have&#13;
fallen behind levels attained in other Latin American economies. Thus, there is the need to&#13;
continue the development of legal and regulatory reforms consistent with the orderly&#13;
development of this class of investors while maintaining the integrity of the securities&#13;
markets. Part of this effort would also have to involve development of adequate operational&#13;
capacity where the role of all commissions, including the newly created CONSAR&#13;
(Retirement Saving System Commission), would be critical. This would ensure the integrity&#13;
of the markets in the eyes of domestic and foreign investors.&#13;
4t By June 1994, overdue loans as a percentage of total loans for the consolidated banking&#13;
system had grown beyond 10% from 2% in 1990. In addition, the disparity across banks has&#13;
continued to grow as some banks have ratios of close to 20 percent while many had ratios in the&#13;
6-8 % range. Source: Comisi6n Nacional Bancaria.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
10.   Compliance with NAFTA's requirements to permit entry by foreign financial service&#13;
providers and the authorization of charters to new financial interrmediaries5', even if not&#13;
significant in increasing direct competition in all forns of financial services in the short term,&#13;
should help reduce financial intermediation margins over time.&#13;
11.   Development of Institutional Infrastructure. Financial sector regulation and&#13;
supervision in Mexico have become increasingly difficult because of (i) the complex&#13;
structures of financial conglomerates and (ii) the fragmentation of regulatory and supervisory&#13;
powers across six Government agencies (see para. 26). Currently, prudential regulations are&#13;
not applied consistently across all entities within financial conglomerates on a group-wide&#13;
basis. Although the consolidated circular has not yet been issued, the commissions are&#13;
already receiving consolidated financial statements. However, it is important to note that&#13;
actual practices vary greatly across individual financial groups within the Mexican financial&#13;
system. In order to enhance regulation and prudential supervision of financial&#13;
conglomerates, individual institutions and markets, it is essential to continue to revise entry&#13;
policies, harmonize valuation standards, require consolidated financial and regulatory reports,&#13;
apply capital adequacy and large credit exposure rules on a consolidated basis, and&#13;
modernize trading practice regulations in areas such as insider trading, conflicts of interest,&#13;
front running, and dumping of securities.&#13;
12.   It is furthermore essential to develop the capacity of supervisory agencies to conduct&#13;
on- and off-site surveillance of conglomerates on a consolidated basis through the improved&#13;
enforcement of existing regulations, increased harmonization of regulation and supervisory&#13;
practices among agencies, and through the upgrading of the skills of supervisory personnel.&#13;
There would also be a need for supervisors to establish performance criteria for directors,&#13;
mangers, and external auditors so that there would be a greater focus on the capacity of&#13;
fmancial conglomerates to properly measure and manage risk. In this context, the sequence&#13;
with which assistance is provided will be important because actions to improve regulatory&#13;
reports and to upgrade standards for off-site supervision if properly designed, will elevate the&#13;
minimum standards at Mexican financial groups for proper measurement and management of&#13;
risk. On-site supervision can then be used to reinforce these standards through the&#13;
enforcement powers vested in the commissions.&#13;
13.   The growth of many types of free-standing non-bank banks (such as mortgage finance&#13;
companies and other specialized financial service providers) alongside financial&#13;
conglomerates (which, at times, have not clearly represented the safety of various financial&#13;
products to consumers) has created uncertainty regarding the extent of the government&#13;
"safety net". It has become essential, therefore, to more carefully define the liability of the&#13;
government and financial conglomerates with respect to all financial products, design and&#13;
" In October 1994, 52 foreign financial institutions received clearance from the SHCP to&#13;
initiate operations in Mexico. The firms included 18 banks, 16 brokerage firms, 12 insurance&#13;
companies, 5 holding companies and 1 leasing company.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
enforce proper non-accounting disclosure provisions for such products, and circumscribe&#13;
explicitly the set of deposit-taking institutions covered by the safety net. In the case of a&#13;
failure, it is essential that the respective roles of Banco de Mexico and the Ministry of&#13;
Finance be redefined and that procedures for failure resolution be well understood by market&#13;
participants.&#13;
14.   Increased financial activity has created the need for a new regulatory and supervisory&#13;
framework for the payments system. This new framework should include an appropriate&#13;
system for large value transfers among commercial banks, ensure delivery versus payment&#13;
(DVP) in trading of securities, and assure secure cross-border transactions. It is also&#13;
essential to examine the legal implications of bankruptcy of clearing members while&#13;
improving Banco de Mexico's supervision of the payment system for large value transfers.&#13;
At the same time, CNV supervision of the Bolsa, INDEVAL (Securities Depository&#13;
Institute), and any clearing house set up for exchange traded derivatives would have to be&#13;
developed.&#13;
15.   Financial Market Development. Mexico's financial sector remains small relative to&#13;
East Asian and the other NAFTA countries, particularly in such areas of non-banking&#13;
services like insurance, securities trading, pension and mutual fund management, and&#13;
financial leasing (para. 9). Expansion of these services and other financial innovations would&#13;
be likely to greatly improve the allocation of resources by the Mexican financial system&#13;
through lowering the cost of managing risk, increasing the financing options for firms and&#13;
individuals, providing increased channels for savings and improving the efficiency of&#13;
allocation of investment through a greater role for institutional investors in corporate&#13;
governance of non-financial companies. An approach relying on public- and private-sector&#13;
monitoring would be necessary to encourage the development of these services.&#13;
16.   On the public sector side, the regulatory, supervisory, and legal framework (para. 11)&#13;
should be streamlined and harmonized across all activities and impediments removed to the&#13;
provision of various forms of non-banking services. Regarding the private sector, ancillary&#13;
financial services (including credit bureaus, ratings agencies, auditing firms, and actuaries)&#13;
and Self-regulatory Organizations and Associations (SROs and SRAsV') should take on a&#13;
greatly expanded role in monitoring financial intermediation and providing information to&#13;
investors and the public. As the complexity and volume of financial transactions increases in&#13;
Mexico, a strengthened role for private sector self-regulation and provision of information is&#13;
critical in proper monitoring of financial institutions and markets&#13;
-' The term SRO usually refers to include entities that establish rules for relations between&#13;
members. and provide some sort of intermediary service, such as exchanges, clearing, and&#13;
custody corporations. The term SRA generally refers to other groups whose members are&#13;
subject to mandatory rules of conduct prescribed by their respective associations and which may&#13;
be overseen by supervisory agencies. Examples of SRAs include associations of auditors,&#13;
accountants, actuaries, appraisers, securities dealers, and warehouses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
17.   As the pace of financial innovation in Mexico continues to accelerate, new&#13;
instruments such as asset-backed securities, foreign exchange forward contracts, warrants for&#13;
equities, OTC options on equities, OTC or exchange traded interest rate futures, and bonds&#13;
with embedded options create new risks which require sound risk measurement and&#13;
management systems. In addition, the increased use of derivative products offshore, in&#13;
particular, highlights the importance of establishing the appropriate prudential regulation and&#13;
supervision capacity in this area. These actions must be taken in tandem with efforts to&#13;
strengthen private financial sector infrastructure in such areas as the payment system or risk&#13;
safeguards used within SROs to monitor and provide reliable and timely information so that&#13;
the use of scarce supervisory resources may be optimized.&#13;
18.   Financial Services for Micro-Enterprises and the Poor. The Government has an&#13;
important role in creating an environment where market-based schemes for the efficient&#13;
delivery of financial services to the poor, micro-enterprises, and the housing sector can be&#13;
developed. The first priority should be to strengthen the legal framework for private sector&#13;
transactions including definition and enforcement of property rights, improvement of public&#13;
registries, and enforcement of contracts.&#13;
19.   Next, the Government should work to strengthen the institutional framework for&#13;
private institutions providing financial services to the poor. Improved supervision, disclosure&#13;
regulations, and legal reforms are needed to ensure the effective operation of institutions such&#13;
as credit unions, popular savings banks, and pawn brokers. The strategic roles of the public-&#13;
sector development banks and trust funds should be re-defined to ensure that their activities&#13;
complement rather than substitute for the financial services provided by these formnal and&#13;
informal private sector institutions.&#13;
20.   Public Investment Evaluation and Budgetin . Given the urgent need for basic&#13;
infrastructure investment in Mexico, further efforts are necessary to ensure the maximum&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness of projects financed. The role of the IE[U should therefore be&#13;
strengthened to provide increased inter-agency technical support and coordination in project&#13;
evaluation and budgeting activities. To this end, the IEIIU should be strengthened in the&#13;
areas of establishing standards for project evaluation, diffusing these standards throughout the&#13;
Government, and training staff within the IEIU and federal government in state-of-the-art&#13;
project evaluation and ex-post assessment. The IEIU needs to closely coordinate with the&#13;
Banco Nacional de Obras y Servicios Pziblicos (BANOBRAS) and the proposed infrastructure&#13;
fund that will constitute another source of public finance in association with the private&#13;
sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
El.   Project Design&#13;
21.   Project Objectives and Approach. The proposed operation is intended to meet three&#13;
interrelated objectives: (a) to improve the safety and soundness of the financial system&#13;
through improved prudential regulation and supervision, and through greater incentives for&#13;
self-regulation by market participants; (b) to support the development of the pension system;&#13;
and (c) to strengthen public investment evaluation and budgeting.&#13;
22.   The project would aim to improve financial sector performance in Mexico through&#13;
building capacity within the regulatory and supervisory agencies, integrating activities across&#13;
regulatory and supervisory agencies to insure consistency of philosophy and implementation,&#13;
and promoting economies of scale through sharing of scarce human resources.&#13;
23.  In addition, the project is designed to modernize the philosophy of supervision and&#13;
regulation by ensuring overall standards for risk measurement and management, shifting&#13;
away from the current system which micro-specifies internal operating procedures such as the&#13;
general ledger of each financial entity. The project would aim to improve transparency and&#13;
timely disclosure of information through strengthened self-regulation by market participants&#13;
and professional associations (SROs and SRAs). These two elements of the program,&#13;
streamlined Government regulation and supervision and enhanced self-regulation, will act&#13;
together to reduce the cost to Government regulatory agencies while helping to reduce the&#13;
cost of compliance for financial institutions and markets.&#13;
24.   The project would also aim to strengthen the evaluation and budgeting process for&#13;
public investment projects throughout the Government through establishment and diffusion of&#13;
technical standards and improved consistency in their application. To this end, the role of&#13;
the interagency coordination committee would be significantly strengthened.&#13;
25.   This project does not directly address the full range of critical issues for the financial&#13;
sector in Mexico noted in Section II (paras. 7 - 19). A broader set of reforms will need to&#13;
be developed to modernize Mexico's financial system and markets. Consistent sets of&#13;
reforms will need to be developed to: improve the possibility for market-based provision of&#13;
financial services to the urban and rural poor, including definition of a more focussed role&#13;
for Mexican development banks and fideicomisos (trust funds); improve the public registries&#13;
for commercial transactions, real estate and land titling; modernize the payments systems to&#13;
reduce credit risk exposure of the Central Bank and permit reduction of the credit risk&#13;
exposure of market participants in securities trading; modernize and rationalize Mexico's&#13;
system of housing finance; finance basic infrastructure development with private-sector&#13;
participation; and improve efficiency of social security and pension-related services at the&#13;
federal and state level both by the Government and the private sector. These other critical&#13;
areas of reform are currently being addressed through separate Bank ESW and project&#13;
initiatives, other multi-lateral institutions, or independent GOM efforts.&#13;
26.   Institutional Framework. Currently, financial sector regulatory and supervisory&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
functions are shared between the Central Bank, the Finance Ministry (SHCP) and four&#13;
commissions which report to SHCP (CNB, CNV, CNSF and CONSAR). Chart I indicates&#13;
the existing structure. Although regulatory and supervisory functions are shared across six&#13;
agencies, the degree of fragmentation is limited because each Commission is legally part of&#13;
SHCP. The Central Bank, which was given increased autonomy under the new Central&#13;
Banking Law ratified in 1994, supervises all over-the-counter (OTC) markets with the&#13;
exception of equity and commodity contracts, develops prudential regulations for commercial&#13;
banks and auxiliary credit institutions which must be formally approved by SHCP, and&#13;
regulates all aspects of the payments system and foreign exchange markets. SHCP is&#13;
responsible for drafting and final approval of all legislation and regulations relating to&#13;
financial institutions and markets. These SHCP functions are undertaken by the Direcci6n&#13;
General de la Banca Multiple (banking and auxiliary credit institutions) and the Direcci6n&#13;
General de Seguros y Valores (insurance and securities).&#13;
27.   The CNB is responsible for supervising financial groups and free-standing auxiliary&#13;
credit institutions which hold over 75% of all financial assets in Mexico: commercial banks,&#13;
development banks, auxiliary credit institutions, and in most cases the holding company of a&#13;
financial conglomerate. The CNV supervises and has some regulatory authority over&#13;
brokerage firms, the Bolsa, and the smaller intermediate market and corporate issuers. The&#13;
CNV also has authority to supervise and regulate all forms of self-regulatory organizations&#13;
such as custody corporations (INDEVAL). The CNV role may be expanded in the future to&#13;
cover exchange related futures and other derivatives clearing houses if and when developed.&#13;
The CNSF supervises insurance and bonding companies. Finally, the CONSAR has&#13;
responsibility for supervision and operations of the Retirement Savings System (SAR).&#13;

28.   The emphasis of this project would be to upgrade the capabilities of the CNB, CNV,&#13;
and CNSF to carry out current supervisory responsibilities and to support the creation of the&#13;
CONSAR. The challenges currently faced by the four commissions vary widely. The CNB&#13;
requires the most assistance, with intensive programs to improve staff technical skills in&#13;
specialized areas of supervision and regulation to be supported under the project. In part,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
this weakness is due to the period of state control of the commercial banks during the 1980s.&#13;
With no need to focus on private market transactions during this time, the CNB did not&#13;
develop the full set of modem supervisory capabilities nor staff with the skills to oversee the&#13;
dynamic and innovative markets of today's increasingly borderless and liberalized Mexican&#13;
financial system. The CNB is by far the largest of the four commissions, with over 1,000&#13;
professional staff (see Table I below). Assistance would include the purchase of computer&#13;
systems, training, and the provision of specialized technical advisory services.&#13;
29.   Unlike the CNB, the securities and insurance industries under the purview of the&#13;
CNV and CNSF remained in private hands during the 1980s, requiring these two&#13;
commissions to remain current in their supervisory practices. However, as the pace of&#13;
financial innovation in Mexico has increased, the need for assistance here has grown. The&#13;
CNV and CNSF, with 309 and 147 professional staff, respectively, will receive more&#13;
narrowly-defined assistance. Finally, the newly-established CONSAR, with staffing expected&#13;
to increase from 38 professionals as of November 1994 to approximately 200 by the end of&#13;
1996, will receive assistance in the start-up of operations through the purchase of computer&#13;
equipment and the completion of key studies.&#13;

30. The Public Investment Evaluation and Budgeting component will support urgently&#13;
needed improvements in the criteria and methodology used in prioritizing public investment&#13;
projects. Upgrading this function of the IEIU has taken on special prominence in light of&#13;
increased emphasis on the development of basic infrastructure in Mexico. The unit has been&#13;
charged with ensuring that resources are channeled to infrastructure projects with the highest&#13;
economic and social rates of return, thereby improving the efficiency of investment and the&#13;
productivity of capital. The IEIU claims a staff of 25 professionals. This unit will also play&#13;
an important role in administering the special infrastructure fund to be established out of&#13;
privatization proceeds and in coordinating with public financial intermediaries engaged in&#13;
either direct lending or guarantee operations to finance infrastructure projects.&#13;
31.   Relation with Other Multilateral Assistance. The Bank has worked closely with the&#13;
IMF since early 1993 to support this strategy and has diagnosed the shortcomings of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
Mexico's system of financial conglomerate supervision. The FrAL represents the natural&#13;
outgrowth of this joint Bank-IMF effort. The Bank has been able to offer the GOM several&#13;
advantages when compared to other potential advisers, such as private consultants and&#13;
representatives of national regulatory agencies. The key advantage has been the ability to&#13;
field teams with a high degree of objectivity combined with international, multi-disciplinary&#13;
experience. Finally, the Project complements the IDB's efforts in providing technical&#13;
assistance to NAFIN to improve its internal risk measurement and management process since&#13;
it would support efforts to improve supervision of development banks and enforce recently-&#13;
issued capital regulations for such entities. IDB's program of technical assistance will also&#13;
focus on direct provision of assistance to commercial banks on risk measurement and&#13;
management techniques.&#13;
32.   Projet Risks. Although the GOM has given every indication that the Project will&#13;
continue to receive strong support, several risk factors remain at this time: (i) possibility&#13;
that the recommended reforms to improve financial conglomerate supervision may be slowed&#13;
due to political considerations; (ii) possibility that mandatory SAR contributions remain&#13;
below the level required for economic viability of system despite the reforms undertaken&#13;
through the project; and (iii) non-implementation of proposals derived from studies or&#13;
inadequate follow-through in implementation of the program by counterpart agencies.&#13;
33.   The design of the project will reduce these risks to the greatest extent possible.&#13;
Notably, SHCP plays the central role of Executing Agency and Guarantor of the project - all&#13;
of the functions to be strengthened are legal responsibilities of SHCP. In addition, the Board&#13;
of Directors of each commission is constituted by officials of SHCP and the Central Bank,&#13;
thereby improving inter-agency coordination and reducing the risks noted above regarding&#13;
implementation of the assistance program.&#13;
IV.  Project Description&#13;
34.   The project would consist of two components: (i) the Financial Sector Regulation and&#13;
Supervision component to be implemented by the Government agencies responsible for&#13;
regulation and supervision of (a) banking (CNB), (b) securities markets (CNV), (c) insurance&#13;
and bonding (CNSF), and (b) the pension system (CONSAR); and (ii) the Public Investment&#13;
Evaluation and Budgeting component to be implemented by the IEIU. Annex I provides&#13;
greater detail concerning the objectives, activities, outputs, forms of assistance, timing, and&#13;
costs associated with the project.&#13;
A.   Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision&#13;
35.   This component consists of activities to strengthen the institutional performance of the&#13;
four commissions charged with regulation and supervision of the financial system in Mexico,&#13;
the CNB, CNV, CNSF, and CONSAR. The activities in each commission are mutually&#13;
reinforcing and are designed to address priorities for strengthening and streamlining each&#13;
commission while providing coordination and consistency of policies to avoid regulatory and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
11&#13;
supervisory arbitrage by market participants.&#13;
Comision Nacional Bancaria&#13;
36.   The overall aim under the CNB sub-component of the project is to support CNB's&#13;
current institutional development plan, which aims to develop a more modem regulatory and&#13;
legal framework to govern the actions of financial institutions and groups. Such a framework&#13;
would replace existing outdated procedures and consist of prudential regulations and&#13;
supervisory practices based on accepted international practice. Issues which would be&#13;
addressed under the program include the following:&#13;
37.   Authorization Function. The objective of this module is to promote sound and&#13;
transparent institutions through proper authorization procedures internationally acceptable and&#13;
consistent with those used by other commissions in Mexico. This can only be achieved by&#13;
developing appropriate written procedures for the processing of applications consistent with&#13;
accepted international practices. Development of authorization procedures now underway&#13;
will receive continuing support during implementation of the project.&#13;
38.   Regulatory and Supervisory Policy. Prudential regulations are to be reviewed and&#13;
recommendations made to address issues such as capital adequacy, large exposures (including&#13;
issues such as related credits and concentration limits), diversification policies, intra- and&#13;
inter-group transactions, conflicts of interest, and trading practices. This review would&#13;
examine existing legal and regulatory constraints and assess the advantages and disadvantages&#13;
of further de-regulation of financial services provision. The review of the regulatory and&#13;
supervisory policy framework would include banks, SROs and anciLlary and para-financial&#13;
service providers.&#13;
39.   General On-Site Supervision and Inspection Process. This module aims to develop&#13;
an effective inspection policy in line with internationally acceptable norms and procedures.&#13;
This policy would be operationalized in a set of comprehensive inspections procedures&#13;
manuals, on-the-job training for bank examiners, and the permanent training program&#13;
discussed below. Assistance would be obtained from other supervisory agencies, foreign&#13;
technical experts, seconded supervisors and inspection manuals of other countries.&#13;
40. Specialized Technical Expertise in On-Site Supervision and Inspection. In order to&#13;
upgrade the quality and capacity of financial supervision, it is necessary to acquire technical&#13;
expertise in new areas such as derivatives, asset-backed securities, and investment banking or&#13;
asset liability management. This would be achieved by the development and implementation&#13;
of a permanent training program for staff, through the secondment of external consultants&#13;
within CNB, and training of supervisors abroad.&#13;
41.   Financial Analysis Capability and Off-Site Supervision. Supervision can be made&#13;
more effective if off-site supervision is undertaken through adequate financial and economic&#13;
analysis. The project would support improvements in technical analysis capability, integrate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
financial analysis into the supervision process (on-site or off-site) and help CNB to develop&#13;
indicators of financial group solvency and financial distress which can be easily monitored by&#13;
management.&#13;
42.   Regulatory Reports and Regulatory Accounting Principles. The objective of this&#13;
module is to upgrade the quality of data requested from individual financial institutions and&#13;
groups, reducing the reporting burden for such institutions.2' To achieve this objective, the&#13;
capacity of processing systems would be upgraded to ensure integrity of data; and regulatory&#13;
and output reports would be redesigned to focus on assessment of the financial risk&#13;
(including credit, market, price, and liquidity risks) undertaken by financial institutions.&#13;
Efforts would also be made to develop policies regarding the publication and disclosure of&#13;
financial information, as well as to redesign the format of existing published reports.&#13;
43.   Information Systems and Budgetary Processes. The complexity and speed of&#13;
financial transactions, coupled with the complex structure of financial conglomerates, make it&#13;
critical to modernize CNB's information systemsY The project would support efforts to&#13;
design a more responsive management information system, finance procurement of modern&#13;
hardware and software, including laptop computers for supervisors undertaking on-site&#13;
inspections, and finance training for support and professional staff in the use of such&#13;
equipment. Finally, support would also be given to automate and to modernize CNB's&#13;
budgetary processes.&#13;
44.   Human Resource Development and Policy. There is currently no articulated policy&#13;
regarding human resource development at CNB. No systematic evaluation of the adequacy&#13;
of the existing skill mix has been undertaken, standards for the hiring of new employees are&#13;
not defmed for CNB as a whole, job descriptions/promotion paths are not well defined, and&#13;
wage compensation and benefits policies do not allow CNB management much flexibility in&#13;
its attempts to reorient the skills mix.&#13;
45.   To address these problems, assistance would be provided to develop a human resource&#13;
development policy. To establish this policy, the project would finance an inventory of the&#13;
skills of existing personnel at CNB. Assistance would also be provided to design minimum&#13;
standards for new hires, develop job descriptions and career development and promotion&#13;
paths, and evaluate changes to wage compensation and benefits policies to better link&#13;
"' These regulatory reports will permit a gradual movement away from current Mexican&#13;
supervision practice which requires financial institutions to prepare and submit the entire general&#13;
ledger. Current requirements have not only led to excessive reporting, but may also hinder&#13;
adoption of more modern risk measurement and management systems by Mexican financial&#13;
conglomerates.&#13;

Comisidn Nacional de Valores&#13;
46.   The overall aim of the CNV sub-component is to: (i) develop appropriate regulatory&#13;
and supervisory policies for new instruments and markets; (ii) promote self-regulation by&#13;
market participants; and (iii) streamline and strengthen regulation and supervision of existing&#13;
activities. The CNV sub-component would focus on ensuring consistency of regulation and&#13;
supervision between CNV and other agencies involved in the project. The following areas&#13;
would be addressed:&#13;
47.   Self-Regulatory Organizations and Associations. This topic has become increasingly&#13;
important as part of the overall strategy to ensure the integrity of Mexico's securities&#13;
markets. As the number of market participants and the complexity of their business dealings&#13;
increases, the development of better self-regulatory practices by Mexican exchanges, business&#13;
and professional associations, custody corporations, and clearing corporations would help to&#13;
conserve government resources needed for supervision. CNV staff and market participants&#13;
would need to be educated about the philosophy and practical issues related to self-&#13;
regulation. In particular, the distinction between the self-policing role of SROs and SRAs&#13;
and the promotional and advocacy role currently played by some associations within the&#13;
securities industry should be made explicit. Positive results in this area would require that&#13;
knowledgeable and experienced CNV personnel perform careful oversight of the internal&#13;
surveillance carried out by SROs and SRAs. Assistance in this area would be provided by&#13;
external consultants familiar with worldwide experience with self-regulation.&#13;
48.   Asset-backed Securities (Securitization). This module would evaluate the regulatory&#13;
framework for asset-backed securities currently traded in Mexico and help develop an&#13;
appropriate regulatory and supervisory framework for new instruments, including mortgage-&#13;
backed securities, which are expected to be introduced in the near term. Assistance would&#13;
be provided by external consultants.&#13;
49.   Investment Advisers and Managers. The growth of retirement savings plans, mutual&#13;
funds and other publicly offered investment vehicles means that more and more investment&#13;
would be influenced or directed by professional advisers and money managers. Regulation&#13;
and supervision of investment advisers and managers would be evaluated by external&#13;
consultants with respect to authorization, conflicts of interest, fee structures, and quality of&#13;
investment advice given to individuals and investment companies. In addition, the&#13;
appropriateness of a requirement that investment advisers be constituted as stand-alone&#13;
entities subject to registration would be examined.&#13;
50.   Conflicts of Interest. Potential sources of conflicts of interest among related&#13;
brokerage houses, banks, insurance companies, investment advisers and managers along with&#13;
conflicts that may arise because of special relationships between financial intermediaries,&#13;
transaction counterparties, and issuers of securities would be examined and analyzed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
General principles to be applied to the identification of conflicts of interest would be&#13;
developed with a goal of developing appropriate regulations. Assistance would be provided&#13;
by external consultants.&#13;
51.   Exchange-traded Derivatives. This module would help ensure that the future&#13;
development of derivatives traded in organized markets such as the Bolsa and the over-the-&#13;
counter market, is organized in the context of a consistent regulatory framework with well&#13;
designed supervision systems in place.2' This assistance would focus on developing&#13;
techniques to improve on-site supervision of brokerage firms' use of such contracts, as well&#13;
as supervision systems for SROs such as the Bolsa, INDEVAL, and any private futures&#13;
clearing corporation if established. External consultants including staff of the U.S. Securities&#13;
and Exchange Commission (SEC), Commodities Future Trading Commission (CFTC), and&#13;
Federal Reserve System, would be among the essential providers of assistance under this&#13;
module. CNV staff would also be seconded to the SEC, CFTC, and other agencies and&#13;
institutions.&#13;
52.   Disclosure Standards. Public provision of reliable and timely information by issuers&#13;
of securities is critical to strengthening the confidence of domestic and intemational&#13;
investors. This module would aim to improve disclosure standards in connection with public&#13;
offerings, extraordinary events, and standard periodic reports. Consistency of approach with&#13;
the disclosure standards of other markets where securities of Mexican issuers are traded&#13;
would need to be addressed to assure that Mexican and foreign investors are on an equal&#13;
footing. Assistance would be provided by external consultants including seconded staff from&#13;
foreign securities regulators, and Mexican attorneys with domestic and international&#13;
experience.&#13;
53.   International Ouotation System. The creation of a trading system for securities of&#13;
non-Mexican issuers may have large potential benefits for the integration of Latin American&#13;
capital markets and Mexico's position as a regional financial center. Current proposals to&#13;
establish this system (Sistema Internacional de Cotizaciones - SIC) would be reviewed under&#13;
the project to ensure the integrity and efficiency of this new market. Assistance to the CNV&#13;
in implementation of the system in the form of external consultants and training abroad for&#13;
CNV staff would also be provided.&#13;
54.   Other Topics in Securities Regulation. Additional assistance on a number of other&#13;
topics in securities regulation would also be provided including: (i) assessment of trading&#13;
practice regulations relating to front-running, best execution, dumping of securities,&#13;
2' More precisely, this loan will provide assistance to CNV which has jurisdiction over&#13;
exchange-traded derivatives. This work will be coordinated with independent initiatives of the&#13;
Central Bank which has jurisdiction over most financial derivatives with the exception of over-&#13;
the-counter equity-linked derivatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
segregation of accounts, and conflict resolution; (ii) streamlining and updating of reporting&#13;
requirements for securities firms to ensure maximum practicality and consistency with&#13;
international standards; (iii) evaluation of capital regulations for broker/dealers and&#13;
development of proposals to ensure consistency with capital adequacy requirements of&#13;
banking operations; and (iv) analysis of the financing, structure, and operations of the&#13;
guarantee fund for brokerage furms.&#13;
Comision Nacional de Seuros v Fianzas&#13;
55.   The overall aim of the CNSF sub-component would be to facilitate the effective&#13;
development and functioning of insurance companies, reinsurance companies, insurance&#13;
brokers and adjustors with supervisory policies consistent with those of other commissions&#13;
and in line with international practices. The following areas would be addressed under the&#13;
program:&#13;
56.  Inspection Process. The project aims to improve the supervisory capacity of CNSF&#13;
with respect to insurance companies, reinsurance companies, insurance brokers, and adjustors&#13;
through a top-down inspection process where on-site supervision would be focussed on the&#13;
most prominent risk(s) for a particular institution. Relevant risks should be identified by&#13;
examiners together with senior management. In order to achieve this objective, it would be&#13;
necessary to: (i) revise policies and procedures for on-site inspections; (ii) improve the&#13;
relationship between regulators and auditors; and (iii) develop an effective training program&#13;
for insurance company inspectors. These objectives would be met through a process&#13;
whereby extemal consultants would first diagnose weaknesses in on-site inspection techniques&#13;
with CNSF staff. Some CNSF staff would then be trained by external consultants and/or&#13;
relevant supervisory agencies in the United States or Canada. Finally, the external&#13;
consultants would evaluate how well CNSF has incorporated needed changes into its&#13;
inspection process.&#13;
57.   Regulatory and Supervisory Policies. As a guiding principle, all regulatory and&#13;
supervisory policies should be fully consistent across all commissions and with international&#13;
standards. In the case of CNSF, particular attention would be paid to the legal and&#13;
regulatory framework governing insurance and reinsurance companies, brokers, and&#13;
adjusters. Policies regarding consolidated accounting and capital adequacy rules would be&#13;
reviewed. In the case of insurance brokers and adjusters, the review of existing laws and&#13;
regulations would focus on the minimum standards for an SRA, including ethical standards,&#13;
certification procedures for new entrants, and surveillance of member practices. External&#13;
consultants with extensive legal and supervisory experience would provide assistance to&#13;
CNSF to compile a summary of principal requirements and related recommendations for&#13;
changes to the existing framework.&#13;
58.   Actuarial Services of CNSF. The objective of this module is to design an effective&#13;
monitoring system of the actuary's work with an appropriate degree of reliance on the work&#13;
of the company actuary and an independent actuarial "auditor". Unnecessary tasks by CNSF&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
actuarial inspectors would be eliminated while reporting and reserving standards would be&#13;
brought in line with international standards. These objectives could be achieved by: (i)&#13;
reviewing actuarial inspection practices with emphasis on greater coordination of activities&#13;
among inspectors; and (ii) reviewing international standards and publishing local actuarial&#13;
standards where necessary. In addition, work is currently being undertaken towards&#13;
developing an appropriate certification process for actuaries. The assistance program would&#13;
involve international actuarial consultants and external training for CNSF actuaries. In&#13;
addition, assistance in this area would be closely coordinated with assistance provided to&#13;
CONSAR in the case of actuarial inspections or disclosures applied to retirement, pensions,&#13;
and associated insurance products such as annuities, life, and disability coverage (see para.&#13;
65).&#13;
59.   Desk Analysis. The role of desk analysis would be enhanced through the&#13;
strengthening the development of a program to better monitor risks in financial institutions.&#13;
This effort would entail the development of early warning tests, the use of financial analysis&#13;
in the supervisory process, the review of current practices and the evaluation of procedures&#13;
followed in other countries. Use would be made of external consultants and CNSF staff&#13;
would receive training abroad.&#13;
60.   Review of Accounting Standards and Regulatory Reports. Regulatory reporting&#13;
standards consistent with international norms would be established under this module of the&#13;
project. In order to do this, the format of existing regulatory reports would need to be&#13;
reviewed and appropriate international practices incorporated. Use would be made of&#13;
external consultants with the necessary experience.&#13;
61. Education of Financial Community. The final module of technical assistance to this&#13;
commission is education of the financial community in the areas of actuarial standards, self-&#13;
regulatory processes for insurance brokers and adjusters, and the management of risks. The&#13;
education would need to include formal training along with the fostering of a closer working&#13;
relationship between CNSF staff and the financial community.&#13;
CONSAR&#13;
62.   The technical assistance program for the newly created CONSAR would follow a two-&#13;
pronged approach. First, the program would support efforts to moderriize the new&#13;
commission and increase human resource capacity in order to strengthen proper supervision&#13;
and ensure maximum integrity of private pension fund management and account&#13;
administration. Second, a study would be financed jointly with CNSF on the further&#13;
development of the Mexican annuities market.&#13;
63.  Internal CONSAR Information Systems. Financing would be provided to develop the&#13;
intemal information system of the CONSAR in order to establish state-of-the-art operations.&#13;
This financing would cover: software and hardware for a staff expected to grow up to 150&#13;
employees over the next year, and development of computer links and interfaces with IMSS,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
ISSSTE, FOVISTE, INFONAVIT, Banco de Mexico, SHCP, and PROCESAR.&#13;
64.   CONSAR National Information Network. In addition to developing an internal&#13;
infornation system for the CONSAR, the loan would finance assistance in the design of a&#13;
communications network between CONSAR regional offices and the main office in Mexico&#13;
City. The regional echis would provide information to different SAR system participants and&#13;
handle complaints on a regional basis.&#13;
65.   Special Studies. A preliminary study of Mexican annuities markets would be financed&#13;
and will be undertaken jointly by CNSF and CONSAR with the assistance of external&#13;
consultants. The study would look at the Mexican annuities markets with an emphasis on the&#13;
impediments to the market's further development. In addition, the study would examine the&#13;
regulatory framework and economics of annuities in other countries (e.g. Chile, US, and&#13;
Canada). Issues to be examined would include: types of annuities to be offered (index-&#13;
linked, fixed payment, and variable rate); disclosure provisions for insurance companies and&#13;
brokers; reporting, fees, and commission structure; actuarial disclosures and standards;&#13;
pricing by insurance companies; and the marketing of these products.&#13;
B.   Public Investment Evaluation and Budreting&#13;
66.   The aim of this component would be (i) to strengthen the internal operations of the&#13;
Investment, Energy, and Industry Unit (IEIU) of SHCP with respect to project evaluation and&#13;
budgeting and (ii) support project evaluation and budgeting activities in other Government&#13;
agencies through improved inter-institutional coordination, communication and training.&#13;
67.  Inter-institutional Coordination. This module would aim to strengthen inter-agency&#13;
communication and coordination between federal, state, and local entities engaged in project&#13;
evaluation and budgeting activities. In addition, the module would assist in the evaluation of&#13;
projects under future public-private partnerships for the financing of infrastructure.&#13;
68.   Standards. Diffusion, and Training. The standards for evaluation of public investment&#13;
projects will be established under this module with assistance from external consultants.&#13;
Following the issuance of standards, the IEIU would conduct a program to ensure that all&#13;
Government agencies engaged in project evaluation are informed of the standards. The Unit&#13;
would also establish a training program in project evaluation for staff of the federal&#13;
govermment.&#13;
69.   Project Evaluation. Under this module, the IEIU would undertake the evaluation of&#13;
specialized projects in specific sectors of the economy with the support of external&#13;
consultants. Projects to be evaluated may include highways, airports, ports, railways,&#13;
water/sanitation, solid waste and other priority sectors. In addition, studies of regional&#13;
development projects would be undertaken.&#13;
70.   Project Inventory and Prioritization. This module will undertake to develop and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
maintain a national inventory of public investment projects which prioritizes and ranks&#13;
projects within and across sectors according to economic, financial, and social benefits. The&#13;
project will support the design and implementation of the inventory system, and assist the&#13;
government to develop criteria and as associated methodology for prioritization of these&#13;
projects.&#13;
71.   Multi-annual Budgeting. Under the project, the IEIU will finalize and implement&#13;
arrangements for multi-annual budgeting under public investment projects. Extemal&#13;
consultants will be contracted to review and evaluate findings of a recent study regarding the&#13;
design of a system for multi-annual budgeting and develop detailed recommendations&#13;
regarding the implementation of this system.&#13;
72.   Ex-post Evaluation and Monitoring. This module will support the development of&#13;
systematic ex-post monitoring and evaluation of public investment projects. The aim is to&#13;
improve the incentive system for maximizing efficiency and productivity in the execution of&#13;
public investment projects.&#13;
SECITON B: PROJECT ADMINISTRATION AND IPLAEMENTATION&#13;
73.   Project Orfanization. The United Mexican States would be the Guarantor for the&#13;
loan made to Nacional Financiera, S.N.C. (NAFIN), a state-owned development bank.&#13;
Execution of the project would be undertaken by SHCP in conjunction with the following&#13;
commissions which are legally under SHCP: (i) CNB, CNV, and CNSF for the Financial&#13;
Sector Supervision and Regulation component; and (ii) CONSAR for the Pension Funds&#13;
component. Each commission would establish a small Implementation Unit (IU) that would&#13;
coordinate assistance to be provided by the Bank and work closely with the Borrower&#13;
(NAFIN) and the Executing Agency (SHCP). As the commissions do not have experience in&#13;
implementing a Bank project, consultants would be hired with the proceeds of the Loan to&#13;
support each IU in Bank administrative procedures and procurement.&#13;
74.   To ensure that the activities financed under the Project remain closely tied to the&#13;
evolving priorities for the financial system, a Project Implementation Review would be&#13;
conducted on a semi-annual basis to update the rolling annual program of assistance. The&#13;
goal of this review would be to ensure the flexibility and continuing relevance of the FTAL&#13;
program of assistance, and not to increase the burden of procedures. The frequency of the&#13;
meetings may be adjusted according to the needs of project implementation. During each&#13;
review, the Bank, Executing Agency, Borrower and each Commission would assess the&#13;
status of project implementation, evaluate the workplan for the next six months, and agree on&#13;
any needed modifications to the originally proposed program. Project completion has been&#13;
targeted for December 31, 1997.&#13;
75.   The signing of the Subsidiary Agreement between NAFIN and SHCP would be the&#13;
sole condition of effectiveness applicable to the project. Conditionality for the Loan would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
19&#13;
be minimal due to the broad agreement in terms of sector policy between the Government&#13;
and the Bank, and the need to rapidly deploy resources to implement the program of&#13;
assistance.&#13;
76.   Training Plan. The coordinator within each of the commission and the Public&#13;
Investment Unit will be responsible for the collection of relevant data and information&#13;
regarding the training courses financed through this project within their entity.&#13;
The specific area responsible for training within each of the commissions will be responsible&#13;
for providing the with a yearly training program. This program will be included in the&#13;
annual work program submitted to the World Bank during the first trimester of each year.&#13;
77.   The yearly training program will include: (i) Summary of previous year's training&#13;
program (including any courses which were programmed for the previous year but did not&#13;
take place); (ii) Proposed changes to training courses; (iii) Title and budget for each course;&#13;
(iv) Name of Consultant(s)/firm(s) responsible for training; (v) Location of course; (vi)&#13;
Estimated number of participants; and (vii) Procurement status of each i.e. firm/institution&#13;
selected, awaiting contract, etc.&#13;
78.   Each coordinator will be responsible for maintaining the following information for&#13;
each of the training courses to be reviewed during the semi-annual reviews: (i) Executive&#13;
Summary; (ii) Title and location of course; (iii) Name of institution or consulting firm; (iv)&#13;
Budget; (v) List of participants (including name and organization/institution he/she&#13;
represents); and (vi) Copy of Evaluation of course completed by the commission.&#13;
79.   Pro1ect Costs and Financin . Estimated Project costs (total cost including Bank and&#13;
GOM financing of US$ 31.36 million) are as follows: Financial Sector Regulation and&#13;
Supervision component including the CNB (US$ 17.50 million), CNV (US$ 1.94 million),&#13;
CNSF (US$ 1.86 million), CONSAR (US$ 1.93 million), and a Project Implementation&#13;
Consultant Fund for the four commissions (US$ 0.44 million); and the Public Investment&#13;
Evaluation and Budgeting component (US$ 7.69 million). The Bank would provide US$&#13;
23.6 million, approximately three-quarters of the total financing, and the GOM the remaining&#13;
US$ 7.76 million. As noted above, the project would finance consultants and procurement&#13;
of hardware and software, but would not finance any recurring expenditures.&#13;
80.   Procurement. Two types of procurement would be undertaken through the Loan: (i)&#13;
consultant services for each of the four commissions; and (ii) goods, primarily computer&#13;
hardware and software and communications equipment, for the CNB and the CONSAR. As&#13;
financial agent, NAFIN would act as the coordinator and adviser to the Commissions for all&#13;
procurement activities under the Loan. Consultants would be hired with proceeds of the&#13;
Loan to finance consultants to assist each Commission in procurement activities (para. 73).&#13;
81.   Selection and appointment of consultants for studies, technical assistance, and support&#13;
of project execution would be carried out in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines: Use of&#13;
Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
(August 1981).&#13;
82.  Procurement of goods would follow the Bank Guidelines for Procurement (May&#13;
1992). To the extent feasible and practicable, the procurement of goods would be done by&#13;
grouping the various items in bid packages estimated to cost US$ 350,000 equivalent or&#13;
more. Packages in this category would be required to follow International Competitive&#13;
Bidding (ICB) procedures using the Bank Standard Bidding Documents. Local Competitive&#13;
Bidding (LCB) would be undertaken for goods estimated to cost more than US$ 100,000 but&#13;
less than US$ 350,000 using the Standard Bidding Documents for Goods satisfactory to the&#13;
Bank. For equipment which cannot be grouped in packages valued at US$ 100,000 or more,&#13;
local shopping procedures would be followed. In the case of procurement and&#13;
implementation of complex informnation and communication systems, the Bank would&#13;
recommend that a 2-stage bidding process which includes a stage for technical qualification&#13;
prior to economic evaluation.&#13;
83.  Bank review of procurement procedures would be as follows: (i) for consulting&#13;
services, the Bank would conduct prior review for all contracts exceeding US$ 50,000&#13;
equivalent for individuals and US$ 100,000 equivalent for firms; and (ii) for procurement of&#13;
gQoas the Bank would review ex ante documentation pertaining to each ICB undertaken and&#13;
for the first two LCBs; (iii) all other procurement documentation is subject to ex post review.&#13;
This review process would result in a prior review of approximately 90% of all Bank-&#13;
financed contracts for goods.&#13;
84.   Disbursements. Proceeds of the proposed Loan would finance: (i) 100% of the cost&#13;
of foreign goods, consulting services, training and technical assistance; and (ii) 90% of the&#13;
cost of local goods, consulting services, training and technical assistance. The proceeds of&#13;
the Loan are expected to be disbursed in accordance with the allocation by categories shown&#13;
in Schedule B of the Memorandum of the President. To expedite project execution, a special&#13;
account in U.S. dollars would be established at the Central Bank, with an authorized&#13;
allocation of US$ 2.3 million equivalent, representing the average amount equivalent to four&#13;
months of eligible expenditures that are expected to be paid from the account. Separate&#13;
accounts of all expenditures financed by the Project would be maintained by the Borrower&#13;
and the Commissions. Withdrawal applications would be fully documented, except for&#13;
contracts smaller than the following specified levels: US$ 350,000 for goods; US$ 50,000&#13;
for individual consultants; and US$ 100,000 for consulting firms. In the case of contracts&#13;
below these specified levels, NAFIN would prepare certified Statements of Expenditure&#13;
(SOE) to be used as the basis for disbursement. Supporting documentation for SOEs would&#13;
be retained by NAFIN and made available for examination by Bank staff during supervision&#13;
missions.&#13;
85.   Retroactive financing of up to US$ 1.9 million equivalent would be provided for&#13;
eligible expenditures incurred after October 1, 1994. Such financing is necessary to put in&#13;
place the institutional structure required to carry out the project and avoid delays in the first&#13;
year of project implementation. It would be used to finance consultant support for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
institutional strengthening of the three executing agencies and for preparation of support&#13;
materials for procurement of goods and services. The project completion date would be&#13;
December 31, 1997 and the closing date would be June 30, 1998.&#13;
86.   Accounts and Audits. NAFIN and the Executing Agency would maintain adequate&#13;
records to reflect all expenditures made under the project. The accounts and statements of&#13;
expenditures would be audited each year by auditors satisfactory to the Bank, in accordance&#13;
with appropriate auditing principles consistently applied. The audit reports would be&#13;
submitted to the Bank not later that six months following the close of the fiscal year.&#13;

aI The proposal is not to conduct a complete review of all prudentiAl regulationts and stipervisory policies applicable to insurnce companies. CNSF officials have worked to keep their&#13;
policies up-to-date with international prectices. However, the need to harmonize policies for all types of financial institutions will likely lead to foriher revisions to the existing&#13;
regulations, practices and policies. This review and analysis should be coordinated closely with that being undertaken at the CNB. In addition, the review will pay specific attention to&#13;
the regulstory framework for reinsumunce companies, and for instirince brokers and adjusters.&#13;
b. In the case of insuirance brokers and adjusters, this service shotild focus on minimum standards for a self-regulatory association, inclusive of ethical standsrds, certification&#13;
procedures for new entrnts, surveillance of member practices, etc.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Financial Sector Technical
            Assistance is intended to meet three interrelated
            objectives: 1) to improve the safety and soundness of the
            financial system through improved prudential regulation and
            supervision, and via greater incentives for self-regulation
            by market participants; 2) to support the development of the
            pension system; and 3) to strengthen public investment
            evaluation and budgeting. Project activities will include:
            hiring external consultants to assist in the development of
            specific policies and regulations; commissioning of related
            studies; financing participation in seminars, advanced
            training programs, and other human resource development
            activities to be conducted both within Mexico and
            externally; secondment of special long-term consultants to
            strengthen specific activities of the Commissions, and
            procurement of necessary software, hardware, and equipment.
