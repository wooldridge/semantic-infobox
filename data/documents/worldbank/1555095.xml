July 1979&#13;
CAPITAL MARKET IMPERFECTIONS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT&#13;
The first paper - Interest Rate, Transaction Costs and Financial&#13;
Innovations - seeks to provide an overall perspective for research in the area&#13;
of capital market imperfections and economic development.&#13;
Capital market-is - must be - imperfect in the sense in which&#13;
economists use this term; for it involves a relationship in time between&#13;
the lender and the borrower in the context of uncertainty. However, it does&#13;
get progressively integrated, widened and deepened with economic and financial&#13;
evolution. How this comes about is the question discussed in this paper. The&#13;
crucial variable in this context seems to be transacti l costs (both admin-&#13;
istrative costs and default risk). Financial innovations reduce these costs&#13;
and thus lower the costs of lending and borrowing (not completely represented&#13;
by the interest rate) and narrow the interest rate differentials. This has&#13;
saving, investment, output and distribution effects. Such is the broad theme&#13;
of this paper.&#13;
The second paper - Some Theory Concerning the Role and Failings of&#13;
Financial Intermediation - develops an analytic frame centered around the&#13;
impact of transaction costs and identifies the type of policy interventions&#13;
that may increase rather than reduce the degree of imperfections in the&#13;
capital market. Further, it identifies areas for policy action in the LDCs.&#13;

INTEREST RATE, TRANSACTION COSTS AND FINANCIAL INNOVATIONS&#13;
The fragmentation of the capital market in the LDCs is generally&#13;
attributed in the literature to the interest rate policy pursued, and it is&#13;
argued that with a high interest rate these imperfections would be removed,&#13;
and that saving and investment would be greater than what they are. This&#13;
diagnosis and this policy advice rest on a theoretical model that is, by and&#13;
large, irrelevant for analysing the problems of economic evolution. 1/ The&#13;
real question to be posed is: how and through what mechanisms the capital&#13;
market gets integrated and thus helps the process of economic development.&#13;
It is not possible to tackle this problem without some understand-&#13;
ing of the process of economic evolution and the role of innovations in this&#13;
process. How financial innovations tend to integrate the capital markets&#13;
through reduction of transaction costs is discussed in Section I. Section&#13;
II deals with the actual evolution of the credit market in a specific rural&#13;
set-up; it is shown how further development of this market could have favour-&#13;
able impact on saving, investment and output. The final section indicates&#13;
the nature of financial innovations that are essential for such a development&#13;
on the basis of an actual case study of a commercial bank.&#13;
I. Financial Innovations and Economic Development&#13;
Transaction Costs, Financial Innovations and Development: One has&#13;
to begin the inquiry with the question: why are capital markets imperfect,&#13;
and how, in spite of the imperfections, do they get integrated with economic&#13;
and financial evolution?&#13;
The transaction which takes place in a capital market relates to a&#13;
relationship over a period of time between a lender and a borrower. Hence the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
product is not merely finance; the nature of the product is also determined by&#13;
the characteristics of the lender as well as the borrower. Uncertainty is of&#13;
the essence of any relationship which involves time. Thus, each product is in&#13;
a sense unique; it is like a custom-made product.&#13;
The supply and demand for funds in each of these markets are matched&#13;
not merely by the interest rate; the terms of lending have variables other than&#13;
interest rate like margin requirements, repayment terms, security, and compen-&#13;
sating balances. Quite often there is no systematic relationship between the&#13;
terms of lending and the amount to be borrowed.&#13;
The crucial variable which determines the terms of lending to each&#13;
class of borrower relates to transaction costs - the administrative costs plus&#13;
the default risk. 2/ The fragmentation of the capital market - the phenomena&#13;
of different markets for different "products" - arises because of the varying&#13;
transaction costs with respect to the different classes of borrowers. The&#13;
progressive integration of these separate markets is brought about through&#13;
financial innovations that tend to reduce these costs. These innovations&#13;
reduce the costs of lending and borrowing (cost as determined by the terms of&#13;
lending) and thus bring about shifts in the supply-demand schedules for credit.&#13;
It is thus that potential saving and potential investment become actual&#13;
through the transmission channels provided by the integration of the capital&#13;
markets. 3/&#13;
The principal variable is, of course, the risk; financial innovations&#13;
tend to reduce risk. But default risk and administrative costs are related;&#13;
default risk can be reduced by more information which involves administrative&#13;
costs. Financial innovations tend to reduce total transaction costs; they&#13;
widen and deepen the capital market.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-3-&#13;
Nature of Financial Innovations: What, then, has been the nature&#13;
of the financial innovations during the process of financial evolution?&#13;
Historically, it was the trader who extended his business by&#13;
financial dealings. It is the invention of money that enabled him to make a&#13;
money loan in place of a goods-loan to another known trader. Here the risk&#13;
was negligible; for the trading class evolved certain rules of the game to&#13;
which the members adhered. But loan to a new trader - not known to him -&#13;
involved risk; the subjective risk could be very high. 4/ But this risk was&#13;
reduced by the financial innovation of security or guarantee - the bill of&#13;
exchange with two signatures. 5/ These two innovations - the code among&#13;
merchant-bankers and the bill of exchange - did not require the sanction of&#13;
law. The other innovation - security for the loan - did require legal&#13;
sanction. Once that was available, two kinds of security evolved - the&#13;
pledge or pawn and the hypotheca (of the Roman Law) or the mortgage (of the&#13;
English Law). 6/&#13;
Then followed the innovation of a financial intermediary - namely&#13;
the bank. This innovation reduced risk in a number of ways. The bank had&#13;
economies of scale; hence it could specialise in and standardise certain&#13;
types of financial transactions and thus reduce risk through better expertise.&#13;
The economies of scale accrued in another way also; its scale enabled it to&#13;
pool and spread risks - the 'Law of Large Numbers', which is the basis of&#13;
insurance.&#13;
This was, however, only a financial intermediation function of the&#13;
bank. Its capacity to perform this function was greatly enhanced by the&#13;
innovation of bank-money - its capacity to create credit. It is through&#13;
this innovation that the banking system helped the process of economic&#13;
evolution directly as well as indirectly through the provision of finance to&#13;
other financial intermediaries specialising in forms of financing different&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
from those of the banks. And, of course, the functioning of the government&#13;
and what Hicks calls "the Administrative Revolution" would not have been&#13;
possible but for this development. 7/&#13;
The bank money and the subsequently related innovations reduced&#13;
the costs of real transactions and they improved the productivity of balances&#13;
kept with the banks. The real yield on deposits with the banks improved -&#13;
the yield which is not reflected in the interest rate on deposits. 8/ This&#13;
revolution in the payments mechanism has been a significant factor in expand-&#13;
ing markets for goods and services'through reduction in transaction costs.&#13;
The benefit is not merely the reduction in transaction costs; it also accrues&#13;
through the reduction in the requirement for money balances for transaction&#13;
purposes - reflected in the increase in the transaction velocity of money. 9/&#13;
However, the banking system became much too specialised; consistent&#13;
with its origin, it provided credit only for certain types of transactions -&#13;
like stocks of goods. The credit for other purposes - like housing or plant&#13;
and equipment - required other specialised agencies like the securities&#13;
markets, which evolved in the U.K. and the U.S.A. more or less along with the&#13;
banking system. In countries where the climate was not favourable for these&#13;
types of credit markets, another financial innovation was introduced - the&#13;
Universal Bank. After all, the other credit markets in a way developed&#13;
because the banks lent finance to them through their customers as well as&#13;
direct purchase of the securities traded in these markets. Why cannot the&#13;
banks specialise in these functions also? And they did in France and in&#13;
Germany during the nineteenth century - beginning from the famous Credit&#13;
Mobilier. IO/&#13;
The recent innovation of Department Store banking 11/ in the&#13;
U.S.A. and the other developed countries has its origin in the concept of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
Universal Bank. The economies of specialisation do not require separate&#13;
institutions; they can be exploited by specialisation within the banks. 12/&#13;
The banks have command over financial resources much larger than those with&#13;
the other institutions; they can easily reap the economies of both scale and&#13;
various types of specialisation.&#13;
Nature of Financial Development in LDCs: Should the LDCs pass&#13;
through the same stages of financial development, through which countries&#13;
like the U.K. and the U.S.A. passed, or should they creatively adapt the&#13;
financial innovation of the Universal Bank, or the recent Department Store&#13;
bank, to their specific needs and requirements?&#13;
The real problem is that of reducing transaction costs of lending&#13;
for purposes other than financing of stocks - in industry and trade. The&#13;
sectors which require credit are small enterprises of all types and agricul-&#13;
ture. At present, the transaction costs of lending to these sectors is quite&#13;
high; they are higher than 6 percent and range between 6 percent to 20 percent&#13;
in different countries. If the financial cost and profit margin are added,&#13;
the banks cannot afford to lend to these sectors at a cost less than 16-30&#13;
percent. At this costs, there would be no inducement to borrow; for the&#13;
expected average rate of profit in these sectors probably does not exceed&#13;
15-20 percent per annum.&#13;
Hence the response has been specialised institutions that lend&#13;
at a loss at subsidised interest rates - the subsidy to the institutions&#13;
being provided by the government directly or indirectly. But these insti-&#13;
tutions lack the motivation as well as the means to reduce transaction&#13;
costs; permanent subsidy cannot be a viable solution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
The banks have the means but lack the motivation. Their Agenda -&#13;
to use the expressive phrase of Arrow - 13/ is geared towards financing trade&#13;
and inventories. They on their own are unlikely to put new items on their&#13;
Agenda; for their expertise - the information and communication system -&#13;
relates to financing trade and inventories and other purposes related to&#13;
the growth of large-scale industry.&#13;
If, however, their Agenda can be changed, it should not be diffi-&#13;
cult for them to respond creatively through financial innovations to this&#13;
challenge of financing agriculture and small enterprises. The case study of&#13;
the Syndicate Bank (Section III) shows that this is possible and it also&#13;
illustrates the nature of financial innovations that would be required to&#13;
reduce transaction costs. The Lead Bank idea which evolved in India after&#13;
1969 should probably be the governing principle for finacial evolution in&#13;
the LDCs. 14/ It is in some sense a creative adaptation of the idea of a&#13;
Universal Bank in the context of a LDC environment.&#13;
II. Evolution of Credit Markets: The Haryana Case&#13;
How credit markets evolve with reduction in transaction costs and&#13;
how they affect real output can be illustrated by the Haryana experience. 15/&#13;
Haryana has been one of the three States in India which adopted the new high-&#13;
yielding seeds since 1964 and experienced almost doubling of productivity per&#13;
acre for wheat in less than a decade. 16/&#13;
Traders as Lenders: Before canal irrigation and the green revolu-&#13;
tion, agricultural credit was provided largely by traders. 17/ The latter&#13;
combined money-lending with trade. Their transaction costs were smaller than&#13;
any other credit agency for obvious reasons. Since the farmers sold their&#13;
surplus output to the traders, it was possible for the latter to appraise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
their "credit-worthiness". Further, the recovery of interest and principal&#13;
was easier for traders than it would have been for any other agency as it was&#13;
possible for the latter to deduct what was due to them from the payment for&#13;
the purchase of agricultural commodities from the farmers. The credit&#13;
provided was largely what Schumpeter calls consumptive-productive credit 18/&#13;
required when the rains failed as also for expenditures on marriage and such&#13;
other social ceremonies. The effective interest rate was probably higher&#13;
than 30 percent per annum - reflecting the average transaction costs exceeding&#13;
20 percent.&#13;
With this high interest rate, it could be argued that the existing&#13;
trader-moneylender would face competition from new traders. But this competi-&#13;
tion was not possible as the transaction costs of the new trader would have&#13;
been even higher than those of the existing trader as the new trader would&#13;
lack the expertise built up by the old one. The effective barrier to competi-&#13;
tion was, thus, the transaction costs.&#13;
Technical Change and Credit Market Evolution: With canal irrigation&#13;
and the high-yielding seeds the situation changed radically. Initially, the&#13;
medium and large progressive farmers adopted the innovation; but since the&#13;
innovations were scale-neutral, even some of the small farmers adopted them.&#13;
The household incomes of the progressive farmers rose by more than 70 percent&#13;
(see Statement I, Appendix A) and the average propensity to save also rose&#13;
with incomes. With this development, Haryana experienced a new phenomenon -&#13;
lending particularly by medium size cultivators to small farmers. This new&#13;
class of farmer-moneylenders replaced the traders in the credit field.&#13;
How do we explain this phenomenon?&#13;
The cultivators who engage in lending belong to the class of&#13;
farmers who own 10 to 30 acres (Statement I, Appendix A). The borrowers&#13;
are largely small farmers owning land in the size group below 10 acres.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
The rich farmers (with land more than 30 acres) do not have much surplus to&#13;
lend as their investment is more or less equal to their saving and borrowing&#13;
from institutional agencies.&#13;
The question, then, is: why do the medium-size farmers lend&#13;
their surplus instead of using it for productive investment as the large&#13;
farmers do?&#13;
All the farmers use canal irrigation. However, when the rains&#13;
fail, the canal system of irrigation also fails to deliver the required&#13;
amount of water. Even for the second crop, the system's supply of water is&#13;
inadequate. The large farmers, therefore, use both canal and tubewell&#13;
irrigation and thus are able to use high-yielding seeds for both the seasons.&#13;
The middle farmers, particularly in the Central and Southern regions of&#13;
Haryana, use only canal irrigation for one crop only and sow a non-irrigated&#13;
less remunerative crop for the second season of the crop year. Why do they&#13;
not invest their savings in tubewell irrigation?&#13;
The reason appears to be the high cost of tubewell irrigation.&#13;
It costs roughly twice as much to sink a tubewell in these low ground water&#13;
areas as it does in the Northern Region or in the Punjab State. Their own&#13;
savings are inadequate for financing this profitable investment, and in&#13;
these areas institutional credit is not available. The large farmers do&#13;
invest in tubewell irrigation even in these areas as their savings are&#13;
adequate for financing this investment. In the Punjab, institutional credit&#13;
is available to the medium farmers for tubewell irrigation. Institutional&#13;
credit as a proportion of total credit is much higher in the Punjab than&#13;
in Haryana as credit institutions are much better developed there than in&#13;
Haryana (see Statements II, III &amp; IV, Appendix A).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9-&#13;
lt is thus that the middle farmers have comne to use their surplv&#13;
for lending to small farmers. They have been able to compete effectively&#13;
with the traders as their terms of lending are more favouratble than those&#13;
of the traders; their interest rate on lendinig is probably in the range of&#13;
15-25 percent per annum as against the range of 30-40 percent for the traders&#13;
(Statement V, Appendix A). They, thus, have otsted the traders from the&#13;
credit business.&#13;
The reason for this lower interest rate is their smaller transaction&#13;
costs. The middle farmers are able to appraise the incomne potential of small&#13;
farmers much better than the traders. And for this appraisal, they do not&#13;
need to spend extra time and effort as the traders have to.    The small farmer&#13;
is probably the neighbour of the middle farmer and the two come in easy contact&#13;
for a variety of common purposes. Both know each other much better than is&#13;
possible for a non-cultivator to know a cultivator's craft. Again, for recovery&#13;
of interest and principal, the middle farmer is at an advantage; he does not&#13;
need to spend any extra time and effort for the purpose. The trader again is&#13;
not the only buyer of wheat as the government procurement operations have&#13;
expanded with the increase in wheat output. And the farmer's ability to&#13;
store his output has also increased with his income.&#13;
This new and relatively large source of credit has enabled the&#13;
small farmers to invest in current inputs like fertilisers required for the&#13;
new seeds and thus turn into progressive farmers. *Ihe middle farmers have a&#13;
new source of income. Thus this evolution of the credit market has helped&#13;
the process of production and investment; the nature of credit has also&#13;
changed from purely production-consumption credit to a combination of such&#13;
credit with investment credit. Even the small farmer's debt to the middle&#13;
farmer arising out of production-consumption credit does not accumulate at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
compound interest; because of the possibility of obtaining credit for new&#13;
inputs like fertilisers and high-yielding seeds, in a normal crop-year&#13;
the small farmer's surplus is more than adequate for repaying his debts to&#13;
the middle farmer - debts contracted during the season when the rains fail.&#13;
The credit advanced is thus by and large productive credit; this has reduced&#13;
the risk for both lenders and borrowers and thus expanded the credit market.&#13;
Credit Markets and Output: However, even with such evolution of&#13;
the credit markets, the full production potential of agriculture is not&#13;
realised. For the middle farmers could invest in tubewell irrigation and&#13;
thus increase output like the large farmers if credit were available to them&#13;
to supplement their savings. Again, if additional credit were available to&#13;
the small farmers, it would be worthwhile for a group of three to four&#13;
farmers - if not for each single farmer - to invest in tubewell irrigation.&#13;
Thus both sets of farmers could use high-yielding seeds also for the second&#13;
crop - for which the canal system does not provide adequate water. Such a&#13;
development has occurred in the Punjab and it could occur in Haryana, which&#13;
is more or less similar to the Punjab with regard to the agro-climatic&#13;
conditions and the innovative characteristics of the farmers. And with&#13;
appropriate financial instruments, this further development of the credit&#13;
markets may not require, except possibly initially, any outside source of&#13;
saving.&#13;
Nature of Further Evolution of the Credit System: Role of a Lead&#13;
Bank: It is not difficult to sketch in broad outline the characteristics&#13;
of this further evolution. There are two to three lead banks in Haryana;&#13;
each one is assigned the responsibility by the Reserve Bank of India for&#13;
expanding its network of branches with a view to mobilising deposit resources&#13;
as well as providing credit for agriculture and small enterprises. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
banking function is sought to be integrated with the function of technica-&#13;
assistance; the lead bank is supposed to coordinate the activities of vari-s&#13;
tecnical assitance agencies - and even to create them, if necessary, with The&#13;
help of the State Government - for the purpose of identifying production&#13;
possibilities and integrating credit with the promotional work. The lead&#13;
bank thus is assumed to play an active role in exploiting the production-&#13;
employment potential of the district for which it is assigned the lead bank&#13;
role. 19/&#13;
Such a lead bank, to start with, can offer credit to middle farmers&#13;
for tubewell irrigation provided they accumulated 25-30 percent of the cost&#13;
of investment as fixed deposits, earning an interest rate of 10 percent per&#13;
annum. Allowing for the risk premium and other transaction costs with regard&#13;
to lending by this group of farmers, this interest rate would compare favourably&#13;
with the rate they earn on lending. Further, their rate of return on investment,&#13;
facilitated by credit from the bank, would be even higher than what they earn&#13;
on lending; this is precisely the reason why the large farmers use their&#13;
savings for productive investment rather than for lending. Thus this type of&#13;
new deposit instrument tied to borrowing facility would indeed be attractive&#13;
to the middle farmers.&#13;
At the same time, it could take over from the middle farmers the&#13;
function of lending to the small farmers. This it can do initially with the&#13;
deposit resources obtained from the middle farmers. This lending too can be&#13;
tied with deposits; a small farmer can be assured credit in a bad year,&#13;
provided he accumulated his surplus from a normal year as deposits. The&#13;
attractive interest rate and the assurance of credit facility could induce&#13;
the small farmers to save more than they would otherwise do. Credit for&#13;
fixed investment - like tubewell irrigation - too could be tied with deposits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
The marginal propensity to save of the large farmers seems to be&#13;
lower than that of the middle farmers. To the extent to which this occurs&#13;
because of the lack of a suitable financial instrument - without risk and&#13;
transaction costs - it would be possible for the bank to attract the potential&#13;
surplus of the large farmers in the form of appropriate deposits. For&#13;
example, the social expenditures of large farmers on occasions like marriage&#13;
of children are quite high. Further, they invest a larger proportion of&#13;
their income in children's education. Deposit schemes tied to borrowing&#13;
facility for these purposes could attract the potential surplus of these&#13;
farmers into deposits with the bank. Once this instrument becomes popular,&#13;
it is quite likely that even marriage expenditures - particularly for gifts&#13;
and dowries - could change their composition; gifts and dowries could be&#13;
given in the form of deposits rather than in the form of goods.&#13;
These new types of deposits linked to lending may suffice after&#13;
the first few years to meet the credit requirements of the farmers and no&#13;
injection of external resources may be necessary. In fact, the system&#13;
could generate resources with increase in incomes for lending to the other&#13;
sectors like industry. Surpluses from agriculture thus could be mobilised for&#13;
financing investment in the non-agricultural sectors.&#13;
However, for such an evolution to take place, the transaction&#13;
costs of lending and borrowing should be lower than what they currently are.&#13;
The bank should be able to lend at an interest rate of about 12-15 percent&#13;
per annum - that is, at a rate lower than that charged by the middle farmer.&#13;
For this to be possible, its transaction costs should not exceed, say,&#13;
about 5 percent. For a bank, it would be possible to realise the economies&#13;
of scale and spreading of risks. It would have also the backing of the&#13;
resources mobilised by the bank from all over India; for the lead bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
for a district is an all-India bank with lead role in about 13-20 districts.&#13;
It can also borrow from the Reserve Bank of India. It would not have the&#13;
type of liquidity constraints from which traders and farmer-moneylenders&#13;
suffer. But the crucial element is the transaction costs. These have&#13;
been quite high - in the range of 7-10 percent. The question is: through&#13;
what innovations could their costs be reduced? The next Section deals with&#13;
the case of an innovative bank which has been able to reduce these costs.&#13;
III. Innovations and Transaction Costs:&#13;
The Syndicate Experience 20/&#13;
Till 1969, the large city-based banks in India concentrated on&#13;
financing large industry and trade in the urban areas. Their transaction&#13;
costs for these markets were quite low - well within the range of 1.5 to&#13;
2 percent, which Keynes indicated many years back as the level below which&#13;
interest rates cannot fall. 21/ They did not enter the field of small-medium&#13;
enterprises in the farm and non-farm sectors. In these markets, their&#13;
transaction costs would have been very high, and at the terms on which they&#13;
could have lent, it was not possible to widen and deepen these markets.&#13;
Characteristics of the Syndicate: For a new bank, it was difficult&#13;
to compete with these city banks in their markets. It has to enter a new&#13;
field - a non-competitive field - and this related to small-medium enterprises.&#13;
This objective opportunity was there, but to seize it required an innovative&#13;
approach to banking - introduction of new "products" and "processes" to&#13;
reduce transaction costs. And this is precisely what the Syndicate Bank&#13;
did since its origin in 1925.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
Located in a small town called Manipal (the only bank with a&#13;
head-office in a rural area) and starting with an initial paid-up capital of&#13;
only Rs. 8,000, its subsequent growth has been remarkable. (Appendix B,&#13;
Statement I). From a negligible share in banking business till 1950, its&#13;
share rose to about 1 percent in 1960 and 4 percent in 1975. Still, it was&#13;
unlike the city-based banks particularly till 1969, when it was nationalised&#13;
along with the other thirteen major banks. In 1968, 32 percent of its&#13;
branches were in rural areas; for the entire banking system, the share of&#13;
rural branches was only 22 percent. Its loans to agriculture and small enter-&#13;
prises constituted 30 percent of its total loans; for the other banks, such&#13;
loans were less than 8 percent of their total loans. 90 percent of its&#13;
deposit accounts were small accounts (below Rs. 1,500) accounting for 50&#13;
percent of its deposits; and 50 percent of its borrowing accounts related&#13;
to small-medium enterprises, their share in total borrowing being 30 percent&#13;
(Appendix B, Statement II).&#13;
Its average interest rate on loans was not much higher than that&#13;
of the city banks; in the fifties and sixties, it was about 2 percentage&#13;
points higher than that of the State Bank of India - the largest commercial&#13;
bank - and from the early seventies, it has been more or less the same as&#13;
charged by the major city banks. How did it, then, manage to grow so rapidly&#13;
even with concentration in markets which the city banks found to be unremu-&#13;
nerative? Obviously its transaction costs must have been comparable to the&#13;
costs of lending to large industry and trade by the city banks.&#13;
Transaction Costs and Functional Cost-Structure: We do not have&#13;
complete data on the cost structure of the city banks. However, the data&#13;
on establishment expenses are available; establishment expenses include a&#13;
large part of administrative costs but do not include default risk (bad debt&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
provision). The ratio of establishment expenses to total deposits for the&#13;
Syndicate was slightly higher than that for the banking system in 1951 and&#13;
1961; but since then, this ratio is in fact somewhat lower for the Syndicate&#13;
than that for the banking system (Appendix B, Statement VI). Quite sur-&#13;
prisingly, the Syndicate ratio is comparable to that of the Insured Commercial&#13;
Banks in the United States (Appendix B, Statement VI).&#13;
Much more interesting, however, would be the comparison of the&#13;
functional cost structure of the Syndicate with the other city banks, who&#13;
have been financing small-medium enterprises particularly since 1969. However,&#13;
such data are not available for any bank in any country. Even for the Syndicate,&#13;
we could obtain such data only for 1975; they were compiled by the Syndicate&#13;
especially for our purposes. One other major commercial bank located in Bombay&#13;
could give us these data again only for 1975.&#13;
The functional cost structure of the Syndicate and the major city&#13;
bank is given in statement IV, Appendix B. The overall transaction costs&#13;
of the city bank are lower than those for the Syndicate; this was to be&#13;
expected as this city bank's lending to small enterprises constitutes only&#13;
25-30 percent of its total lending, while the share of small enterprise&#13;
lending in the total for the Syndicate is about 40 percent. However, the&#13;
city bank's costs are more than three times those of the Syndicate for&#13;
lending to agriculture and small enterprises.&#13;
Again, for deposit mobilsation, the Syndicate's administrative&#13;
costs are much lower than those of the city bank (Appendix B, Statement V).&#13;
The interest costs of deposits are obviously somewhat lower for the city&#13;
bank as demand deposits constitute a much higher proportion of its total&#13;
deposits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
Factors Accounting for Low Transaction Costs: The significant&#13;
question which arises in this context is: how and through what mechanism&#13;
the Syndicate has been able to service a large number of small accounts -&#13;
deposit as well as borrowing accounts - and thus provide credit to the&#13;
small enterprises at a cost which is much below that of the city banks and&#13;
which is lower than that in Mauritius and the Philippines (the countries&#13;
for which we have obtained the data regarding the functional cost structure)?&#13;
(See Statement IX, Appendix B).&#13;
Briefly, it is a new style of banking - an innovative approach to&#13;
banking - that seems to explain this phenomenon; the creative adaptation of&#13;
the banking technology to suit local conditions seems to be the crucial&#13;
factor.&#13;
1.   New Entrepreneurs: 22/   This adaptation was possible because of&#13;
the characteristics of the leadership. The promoters came from a lower-middle&#13;
class background; they belonged to a community which respects learning.&#13;
None of them came from an industrial house; the city banks were started by&#13;
promoters who had close links with large industry. Of the three promoters,&#13;
one was a medical doctor, one an engineer and the third a trader dealing in&#13;
hand-loom cloth.&#13;
All of them were participants in the movement of socio-economic&#13;
reform, initiated by Mahatma Gandhi. They had a powerful motivation for&#13;
the socio-economic uplift of the community and the region to which they&#13;
belonged; hard work, education and thrift - these they considered crucial&#13;
for socio-economic reform. They had not merely a passion for reform. They&#13;
had not merely a hard-headed business sense. They had both. And banking was&#13;
considered by them as an instrument for the purpose; to serve as an effective&#13;
instrument, it had to be viable and gain vitality for growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
They were responsible for establishing educational institutions -&#13;
a school in each village in their district and an educational complex, a&#13;
type of university center at Manipal - the village to which they belonged.&#13;
The bank management helped the process; but, at the same time, they were&#13;
conscious of the deposit potential of these institutions. The bank provided&#13;
employment opportunities for the educated members of the local community; but&#13;
this helped in having a dependable and dedicated staff. The bank helped the&#13;
farmers and small enterprises by providing technical assistance; but this&#13;
enlarged their business. The bank cultivated the habit of thrift in the&#13;
community through a new deposit scheme - called pigmy deposit; but this&#13;
enlarged the bank's resources.&#13;
2.   Recruitment and Promotion Policies: 23/   The major factor res-&#13;
ponsible for the relatively high productivity of the staff has been its&#13;
recruitment policy. It selects relatively unsophisticated persons with&#13;
local contact and a rural or semi-urban background; and, unlike the city&#13;
banks, it has preferred again high school graduates to graduates or post-&#13;
graduates from a university. Their familiarity with the local scene and&#13;
their contacts enable them to expand Syndicate business in a variety of&#13;
ways; they inspire confidence in potential depositors, they are able to&#13;
appraise well the soundness of projects and the credit-worthiness of&#13;
borrowers and to assess the business potential of the area in which they&#13;
function. The information costs thus are reduced; persons without this&#13;
background would have to collect more information and spend more effort&#13;
and time in appraising the soundness of borrowers and their schemes.&#13;
Since they are high school graduates, they enter the banking&#13;
business at a fairly young age and thus are more adaptable. Again, since&#13;
they would not have got such a job in the city banks, they consider themselves&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
fortunate and hence are more dedicated, dependable and disciplined than the&#13;
graduates. They are prepared to do considerable field work, which is so&#13;
essential for attracting, maintaining and supervising small accounts. And,&#13;
of course, their pay scales are lower than those for the graduates in the&#13;
city banks; the Syndicate's average salary per employee even now is 20-30&#13;
percent lower than that in the city banks. And their academic qualifications&#13;
are adequate for the banking business. Persons with university degrees are,&#13;
in fact, over-qualified for a large number of jobs in a bank; from the point&#13;
of view of the institution, such persons are less adaptable, more ambitious&#13;
and less disciplined than those who have completed high school education.&#13;
The promotion policy of the bank is such as to build staff morale&#13;
and avoid discontent and demoralisation. Somewhat on the Japanese style, a&#13;
person is promoted salary-wise and grade-wise on the basis of seniority,&#13;
provided there are no consecutive adverse reports on his efficiency. But&#13;
such a promotion does not mean that he would get a more responsible func-&#13;
tional assignment. Seniority-wise promotion in a salary grade is divorced&#13;
from functional promotion. Responsible positions are assigned to bright&#13;
persons without affecting adversely the salary-wise promotion of others&#13;
and without affecting favourably their own salary grades. Functional&#13;
promotion thus is a type of reward for the really deserving; he wins&#13;
recognition for his worth. The others are not discontented as their&#13;
salary-wise promotions are not affected.&#13;
This divorce of functional promotion from seniority-wise promotion&#13;
in a salary grade helps the bank in selecting persons for senior management&#13;
positions. For the top few jobs, which are on a pure selection basis,&#13;
the bank has a choice from among the persons who are really competent -&#13;
those who are promoted function-wise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
There is another characteristic of the bank's recruitment policy&#13;
which is worth noting. In cases where it is feasible, the bank recruits&#13;
married couples. The stability, reliability and dedication of such couples&#13;
have been significant - more than those of the other employees.&#13;
This recruitment and promotion policy is reflected in the pro-&#13;
ductivity of the Syndicate employees. The deposit accounts handled per&#13;
employee are 287 for the Syndicate, while they are only 120 for the banking&#13;
system as a whole.&#13;
Again, the borrowing accounts per employee are 48 for the Syndicate&#13;
as against only 14 for the banking system. The Syndicate productivity&#13;
differential as compared with the city banks obviously would be much greater&#13;
than what is indicated by these figures, for here the comparison is with the&#13;
average for the banking system as a whole. If the wage differential is&#13;
considered along with the physical productivity differential, the productivity&#13;
differential in financial terms would indeed be much more significant than&#13;
the physical productivity differential.&#13;
3.   Technical Assitance:   The bank provides technical assistance to&#13;
farmers as well as small industrialist-s. It has a special staff for the&#13;
purpose. The Farm Representatives are a special cadre of young officers&#13;
recruited from the Agricultural Universities and specially trained for&#13;
the banking business. Similarly, for the small industry sector, the bank&#13;
has a cadre of Industrial Engineers and Technicians.&#13;
Each one of these officers looks after several branches - about 5&#13;
to 10 - depending upon local conditions. The bank's policy of opening&#13;
branches in clusters in a given region helps it to spread the costs of&#13;
these special cadres over a number of geographically contiguous branches.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
The technical assistance provided, of course, helps the borrowers;&#13;
but at the same time it enlarges bank's business and reduces its risk.&#13;
These special cadres are able to appraise credit proposals in the field -&#13;
they provide an effective appraisal machinery. But at the same time, their&#13;
periodical field visits provide an effective machinery for supervision as&#13;
well as recovery of loans.&#13;
4.   Decentralised Decision Making and Avoidance of Paper Work:   The&#13;
volume of work involved cannot be effectively handled without decentralised&#13;
decision making. The loans to farmers and small enterprises are sanctioned&#13;
by the branch managers with the advice of the technical cadre; there is no&#13;
reference to the head office and thus the head office costs for such loans&#13;
are negligible.&#13;
Again, there is much more emphasis on field work than desk work -&#13;
on local decision making and initiative than on paper work. The branch and&#13;
the branch manager are judged on their overall results - the volume of&#13;
deposits and the magnitude of loans and their recovery; the bank, thus,&#13;
exercises utmost economy in the sphere of documenting, information and&#13;
its transmittal to the head office. Such reporting procedures would increase&#13;
costs and divert the attention of the branch manager from banking business&#13;
to collecting and documenting such information - which is hardly relevant for&#13;
decision making either at the branch level or at the head office level.&#13;
Of course, after nationalisation in 1969, these information costs&#13;
have increased because of the Reserve Bank of India directives and require-&#13;
ments. But still, the management is alert to keep them within certain&#13;
limits. The central banks and the international banks do have a craze&#13;
for information and demand from the intermediary and final lending agencies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
types of information which may be enlightening for researchers but are&#13;
irrelevant for real decision making; they still have to realise that there&#13;
are costs involved - sometimes are large as 1 to 2 percent of the loan&#13;
portfolio. Instead of reducing transaction costs, they raise them. 24/&#13;
5.   Innovative Deposit Schemes:   The bank has introduced a variety of&#13;
innovative deposit schemes linked to motives to save. One recent example&#13;
is the Farmers' Protection Deposit Scheme. In times of dire necessity&#13;
arising out of crop failure, the farmer is eligible for a loan equal to&#13;
double the amount of deposits outstanding in his account. This deposit&#13;
earns interest at 5 percent per annum and the loan is at a concessional&#13;
rate of 9 percent per annum - repayable over a period of three years. The&#13;
small farmer does not save normally in the form of a financial asset; interest&#13;
rate on deposits is not much of an attraction to him particularly when his&#13;
transaction costs are high. But he can be induced to save in the form of a&#13;
deposit if it is linked with borrowing at a time of crop failure. In the&#13;
absence of crop-insurance, this is the type of saving which the farmers need. 25/&#13;
This principle of linking deposits with lending for a specific&#13;
purpose has been applied by the bank in several cases. A farmer, for example,&#13;
would get a loan for the purchase of a pump set if he has accumulated 25&#13;
percent of the cost as fixed or saving deposits. A small industrialist gets&#13;
a loan for machinery purchase if he accumulates more than 20 percent of the&#13;
coSt as deposits. Such schemes help the bank in mobilising deposits as well&#13;
as judging the seriousness of purpose of the borrower; at the same time&#13;
because of the assurance of a loan, the borrower has inducement to save.&#13;
Without such assurance, in many cases, there would not be saving enough for&#13;
investment and, hence, there would be a strong temptation to use it up for&#13;
financing emergencies or social expenditures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
But the one deposit scheme for which the bank is known is the&#13;
Pigmy Deposit. This was introduced by the bank in 1928 and was part of the&#13;
crusade of inculcating the habit of thrift among relatively poor people. At&#13;
the same time, the promoters regarded it as a business opportunity. This&#13;
opportunity was not seized by the other banks because of the transaction&#13;
costs involved in collecting small deposits from a large number of relatively&#13;
uneducated and poor customers.&#13;
The Syndicate, however, devised a scheme that proved to be finan-&#13;
cially profitable for the bank and at the same time attractive to the deposi-&#13;
tors. The principle of the scheme was simple: it involved door-to-door&#13;
collection of a given amount of deposits (as low as 25 paise or say, 3 U.S.&#13;
cents at present exchange rate) at stated intervals. Quite a large number of&#13;
people, like workers, petty shop-keepers, vegetable vendors, hawkers, small&#13;
traders - it was thought - could save these small amounts per day, per week,&#13;
or per month. But they do not have time to go to a bank and deposit this&#13;
amount regularly. This potential saving was not realised as the poor had no&#13;
semi-contractual obligation to accumulate. With agents appointed to collect&#13;
such deposits, this saving capacity and inclination can be tapped.&#13;
And, thus, the Syndicate introduced this Pigmy Deposit to be&#13;
collected periodically from the door-steps of the saver. The commission rate&#13;
was linked with the amount of deposits collected and has not exceeded 3&#13;
percent per annum. The interest was 3.13 percent per annum provided the&#13;
saver did not withdraw from the scheme for seven years. A depositor saving&#13;
0.12 rupees daily could accumulate at the end of the seventh year Rs. 350.&#13;
Within this period, the saver could borrow from the bank against the&#13;
security of his deposit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
Such was the original scheme. Its specific features have varied&#13;
after 1969, but the broad principle still remains the same.&#13;
On an average, the total cost to the bank of this long-term deposit&#13;
has varied between 3 to 5 percent per annum, significantly lower than the cost&#13;
of a 3 to 5 year fixed deposit. Even in 1975, its total cost was only 5.52&#13;
percent as against the cost of fixed deposits at 13 percent. (See Statement V,&#13;
Appendix B).&#13;
The bank was thus able to seize a business opportunity without&#13;
competition from the other banks till 1960. The Pigmy Deposits constituted&#13;
14 to 15 percent of total deposits in 1946; this proportion rose to 21 percent&#13;
in 1960. Since then, its relative significance has declined with the faster&#13;
growth of the other deposits and competition of the other banks. Still, even&#13;
in 1975, these deposits constituted 7 to 8 percent of total deposits. (See&#13;
Statement VII and VIII, Appendix B). In absolute terms, these Pigmy Deposits&#13;
are currently more than ten times their amount in 1960.&#13;
For the saver, such a deposit enabled him to accumulate his small&#13;
saving into a fairly sizeable figure in seven years. Without this facility,&#13;
very likely he would not have saved or, at any rate, saved as much. His&#13;
motivation to save has been to accumulate for emergency or other anticipated&#13;
expenditures rather than the inducement of earning interest. This deposit,&#13;
thus, has been linked with this type of motive among the relatively poor. 26/&#13;
Even the commission paid to the agents has not been a net loss&#13;
to the bank. The agent has to keep a security deposit with the bank equal to&#13;
10 percent of his commission; this is done for minimising the danger of the&#13;
agent disappearing with his collection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
" 24 -&#13;
Central Bank Response to Syndicate Innovations: The Central Bank -&#13;
Reserve Bank of India - itself has been innovative in many ways; 27/ but with&#13;
regard to the unconventional practices of the Syndicate, it took a negative&#13;
attitude. The Syndicate till 1965 was considered as an unsophisticated ruial&#13;
bank and the Central Bank did not like some of its innovations. This is an&#13;
instance of how immitation of the technology of a developed country can corne&#13;
in the way of creative adaptation of modern technology.&#13;
1.   With regard to the Pigmy Deposits, the Syndicate permitted its&#13;
own employees to work as agents during their spare time. For the bank&#13;
this was one of the ways of reducing its wage costs and increasing its&#13;
business; for the employee it was an incentive to earn more. But in 1962,&#13;
the Central Bank found this practice to be objectioonable on strict banking&#13;
principles and prohibited the Syndicate from engaging its own employees as&#13;
agents.&#13;
2.   The Syndicate wanted to set up an agricultural demonstration&#13;
farm in 1964 to enable it to promote the adoption of new high yielding&#13;
seeds by the farmers. The Central Bank considered such a venture in technical&#13;
assistance as not consistent with healthy banking practices. Hence the&#13;
Syndicate had to think of other ways. It induced the progressive farmers to&#13;
set up a voluntary organization called Syndicate Agricultural Foundation; the&#13;
management in fact is looked after by the bank - the bank providing financial&#13;
assistance to the Foundation through annual grants.&#13;
3.   In 1960, the bank pioneered a unique investment service through its&#13;
Investors' Agency Department. This service enabled the middle income group&#13;
savers to invest in shares of reputable companies. The persons joining&#13;
the scheme were assured of a return of 9 to 10 percent per annum on their&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
saving; the bank in turn invested these sums in shares. This scheme became&#13;
very popular with middle income groups in semi-urban areas - persons who were&#13;
nOL FamiLiar with the stock market. It was a precursor to the Central Bank&#13;
sponsored Unit Trust of India. However, this service had to be withdrawn in&#13;
l"65 as the Central Bank thought it could compete with the Unit Trust of&#13;
Tndia that was set up in 1964.&#13;
It is pertinent to note that since 1969 nationalization of 14&#13;
major banks, the Central Bank has been inducing the banks to expand their&#13;
branches in rural areas so. as to provide credit to small enterprises in both&#13;
the farm and non-farm sectors. With this emphasis on the widening and&#13;
deepening of the geogrpahical and functional scope of the banking system, the&#13;
Syndicate has recently been regarded by the Central Bank as a Model Bank.&#13;

financial improvements, diminishing the size of our 'gap';&#13;

"Two types of risk affect the volume of investment.....The first is&#13;
the entrepreneur's or borrower's risk....a second type....we may&#13;
call lender's risk....Now the first type of risk is, in a sense,&#13;
a real social cost, though susceptible to diminution by averaging&#13;
as well as by an increased accuracy of foresight. The second,&#13;
however, is a pure addition to the cost of investment....Moreover,&#13;
it involves in part a duplication of a proportion of the entre-&#13;
preneur's risk, which is added twice to the pure rate of interest....&#13;
For if a venture is a risky one, the borrower will require a wider&#13;
margin between his expectation of yield and the rate of interest&#13;

for a portion of the risk has not hitherto been emphasised, so far&#13;
as [ am aware; but it may be important in certain circumstances."&#13;

5/   There is an interesting story about the origin of these two signatures.&#13;
See E.J.T. Acaster, 'Banking with the Laboucheres', The Three Banks Review,&#13;
(Issue No. 100, December, 1973). To quote:.&#13;
"In the 1790s the distinguished Amsterdam banking house of&#13;
Ho, and Company had some business to transact with that&#13;
rising English banker Sir Francis Baring and entrusted the&#13;
mission to a young French clerk of the name of Labouchere.&#13;
During his stay in London the clerk fell in love with Sir&#13;
Francis' daughter, Dorothy, and asked her father for permission&#13;
to become engaged. Permission was refused, 'Would it make any&#13;
difference to your decision if you knew that Mr. Hope was about&#13;
to take me into partnership?', asked the young man. Sir Francis&#13;
confirmed that it would."&#13;
"On returning to Holland, therefore, Labouchere mooted with his&#13;
employer that he should be promoted to the partnership. Unfor-&#13;
tunately for the proposer, the idea was not well received.&#13;
'Would it make any difference to your decision if you knew that&#13;
I was engaged to the daughter of Sir Francis Baring?', asked&#13;
the clerk.  'Well, yes, it would,' admitted Mr. Hope. Then and&#13;
there the young Pierre Cesar clinched the deal, laying the founda-&#13;
tion for his family's fortune by stating his engagement to be a&#13;
fact, and by the next London mail he was able duly to confirm to&#13;
Sir Francis that his entrance to the partnership of Hope had&#13;
become a reality." (p. 29).&#13;
6/   On financial innovations, see John Hicks, A Theory of Economic History,&#13;
(Oxford: Oxford University Press: 1969), Chapters V &amp; VI.&#13;
7/   See Schumpeter, Business Cycles, Vol. I, op. cit., pp. 111-112. See&#13;
also Hicks, Economic PerspectLves, op. cit., pp. 78-79. What Schumpeter&#13;
calls innovations and Hicks calls impulses require credit creation;&#13;
the latter is, as Schumpeter observes, the 'monetary complement of&#13;
innovation'.&#13;
8/   See Boris P. Pesek, 'On Post-Robertson Monetary Theory', Journal of&#13;
Economic Literature (Volume XIV, Number 3, September 1976), pp. 856-881.&#13;
Pesek also shows how important parts of monetary and banking theory rest&#13;
on theoretical and empirical assumptions that are indefensible and any&#13;
lack a sound micro-economic base.&#13;

Perspective, (Cambridge, Mass., Harvard University Press, 1962),&#13;
pp. 11-16. To quote:&#13;
"In particular, the story of the Credit Mobilier of the&#13;
brothers Pereire is often regarded as a dramatic but, on the&#13;
whole, rather insignificant episode....It seems to be much better&#13;
in accord with the facts to speak of a truly momentous role of&#13;
investment banking of the period for the economic history of&#13;
France and of large portions of the Continent...But more important&#13;
than their slavish imitations was the creative adaption of the&#13;
basic idea of the Pereires and its incorporation in the new type&#13;
of bank, the Universal Bank which, in Germany, along with most&#13;
other countries on the Continent, became the dominant form of&#13;
banking. The difference between banks of the credit-mobilier&#13;
type and commercial banks in the advanced industrial country of&#13;
the time (England) was absolute.   Between the English bank&#13;
essentially designed to serve as a source of short-term capital&#13;
and a bank designed to finance the long-run investment needs&#13;
of the economy there was a complete gulf. The German banks,&#13;
which may be taken as a paragon of the type. of the Universal&#13;
Bank, successfully combined the basic idea of the credit&#13;
mobLlLer with the short-term activities of commercial banks....&#13;
the banks acquired a formidable degree of ascendancy over&#13;
industrial enterprises, which extended far beyond the sphere&#13;
of financial control into that of entrepreneurial and managerial&#13;
decisions."&#13;
11/  See R.W. Goldsmith, 'Some Reflections on the Past, Present and Future of&#13;
Financial Institutions', (Mimeo. 1974). To quote:&#13;
"There are two tendencies at work here which have already operated&#13;
since the early history of financial institutions, tendencies which&#13;
you may call the specialty shop and the department store principle.&#13;
A specialty shop in finance holds, essentially, one type of financial&#13;
instrument and raises most of its funds also by one, though a dif-&#13;
ferent instrument. At certain times and cetain countries, the one&#13;
or the other system has prevailed. England was, during most of its&#13;
modern financial history, a fitancial speciality shop country, as&#13;
were the United States. Germany, on the other hand, has always been&#13;
more of a financial department store country, France being generally&#13;
in the middle. In the last decade, however, there has been a definite&#13;
tendency, in virtually all countries, for the department store model&#13;
of finance to gain, particularly in the field ;of deposit banking....&#13;
Finally, something happened during the fifties" and the sixties. It&#13;
probably became obvious to bankers that, if they continued to do&#13;
business as before they would continue to lose in importance.    This&#13;
trend soon becamu worldwide, partly because it is much easier to&#13;
transfer financial technology from one country to another than to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
do so in the case of industrial technology ..... This movement&#13;
towards financial department store operations is, I think, one&#13;
of the most important trends to watch in developed countries in the&#13;
next generation....It has always been present to some extent and is&#13;
particularly pronounced in less developed countries." (pp. 82-84).&#13;
12/ See Hicks, Capital and Growth, op. cit., p. 292. Hicks emnphasises the&#13;
point that the efficiency of a financial system should be judged on the&#13;
basis of the narrowness of the gap between the lowest and the highest&#13;
interest rate. The function of the non-bank financial intermediaries&#13;
is to narrow this gap. But Hicks notes: "An alternative possibility,&#13;
that the 'contact' (which I have ascribed in the above to financial&#13;
intermediaries outside the Bank( might sometimes be established by&#13;
specialized departments within the Bank (or banking system) itself,&#13;
should not be overlooked. It would certainly need attention in a more&#13;
extended treatment." (p. 292).&#13;
13/ See Arrow, op. cit., pp. 47-57. To quote:&#13;
"In classical maximizing theory it is implicit that the values&#13;
of relevant variables are at all moments under consideration.&#13;
All variables are therefore agenda of the organization, that is,&#13;
their values have always to be chosen. On the other hand, it is&#13;
a commonplace of eveyr day observation and of studies of organi-&#13;
zation that the difficulty of arranging that a potential decision&#13;
variable be recognized as such may be much greater than that of&#13;
choosing a value for it." (p. 47).&#13;
14/ See V.V. Bhatt, Structure of Financial Institutions, (Bombay: Vora and&#13;
Company 1972), Chapter I. To quote:&#13;
"This problem is now being tackled by giving a new radical&#13;
orientation to the commercial banking system....To provide the&#13;
agriculture-small industry orientation to the banks' policies,&#13;
a new and potentially fruitful concept of a lead bank in a&#13;
district has been evolved....This lead bank scheme is likely tow&#13;
be more effective than a new district bank scheme; for, the lead&#13;
bank would be much more viable financially because of its nation-&#13;
wide operation and, further, for the same reason, it would have&#13;
at its disposal much larger resources than a small district bank."&#13;
"The main functions of a lead bank would be to: (a) identify&#13;
places in a district for branch expansion; (b) prepare a phased&#13;
program for branch expansion in the district so as to bring banking&#13;
services within the reach of the entire area; (c) estimate the&#13;
current requiremaent of credit and prepare a phased program to meet&#13;
it by supplanting the non-institutional moneyleders type of credit&#13;
purveyors; (d) identify the potential areas of agricultural and&#13;
small industry development and to induce local entrepreneurs to&#13;
undertake such development; (e) identify the major bottlenecks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
in the development of the district and induce the appropriate&#13;
agencies to take remedial action; (f) goad the local entrepreneur&#13;
in agriculture and small industry to improve progressively his&#13;
productive efficiency; and (g) devise such schemes of deposits and&#13;
financial investments as would prove attractive to the local people&#13;
and effective for the purpose of mobilising as well as raising the&#13;
rate of saving in the district."&#13;
"The lead bank obviously cnanot perform these functions in isolation:&#13;
it would have to solicit the active support of other banks in the&#13;
district....and other State-level financial institutions as also&#13;
of the various official and non-olfficial agencies. The role&#13;
expected of a lead bank is not merely that of purveying credit and&#13;
deposit mobilisation, it has to provide entrepreneur and managerial&#13;
guidance to agriculture and small industry." (pp. 16-17).&#13;

15/  It is not possible to identify the impact of innovations on the basis of&#13;
aggregative or semi-aggregative data, however sophisticated the econometric&#13;
techniques are.  See Schumpeter, Business Cycles, op. cit., p. 144 and&#13;
Pesek, op. cit.  Hence the emphasis in this article on actual case-studies&#13;
of financial innovations.&#13;

SOME THEORY CONCERNING THE ROLE AND FAILINGS OF FINANCIAL INTERMEDIATION IN&#13;
LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
Financial intermediation in developing countries is a subject which&#13;
has received scant attention from theoretical economists, although it has&#13;
stimulated a massive output of writing from economists having more institu-&#13;
tional and descriptive inclinations. Unfortunately, and irrespective of&#13;
the merits of the institutional writings, the absence of theoretical under-&#13;
pinning is surely one of the reasons why financial sector policies have often&#13;
taken a back seat relative to, say, trade and fiscal policies, when strate-&#13;
gies for the more rapid, and balanced, development of the LDCs have been&#13;
under consideration. It is also the reason why financial intermediation as&#13;
such is either ignored, or treated in preemptory fashion, in quantitative&#13;
analyses of development issues.&#13;
While there will never be a theory of financial intermediation&#13;
which captures all, or even most, of the complexities of institutional&#13;
reality and inter-country differences, it is possible to put together certain&#13;
strands of a theory in such a way as to better understand the fundamental&#13;
role of a financial sector, the factors which limit its effectiveness and&#13;
the benefits which might accrue from improving it. That is the purpose of&#13;
this paper.&#13;
The entire argument is hung on to a neo-classical construction&#13;
recently propounded by Lewis Spellman. This is not because the author has&#13;
any particular commitment to the neo-classical mode of thinking - indeed the&#13;
argument as it develops embraces many aspects which are quite foreign to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
such thinking. Rather the view is that, since financial sector issues can&#13;
only be properly discussed given some underlying assumptions about the&#13;
technical conditions of production, it is as well to make this clear by&#13;
explicit reference to an underlying production function. Having accepted&#13;
this, the smooth continuous production function of neo-classical growth&#13;
theory has obvious advantages of generality. Furthermore its use does not&#13;
preclude the easy translation of most of our conclusions into the form in&#13;
which they would arise from the assumption of a rigid technology.&#13;
Section II below summarizes the Spellman model in its original&#13;
form. Section III identifies certain factors like uncertainty and imperfect&#13;
information which will normally operate in LDCs to reduce the level of finan-&#13;
cial intermediation as it emerges from Spellman's analysis, and discusses the&#13;
implications of incorporating these factors in the argument. Section Is&#13;
considers the sectorisation of the model and thereby opens the way for an&#13;
analysis of the possible distributional consequences of imperfectly func-&#13;
tioning financial markets. Section V examines both the aggregative and the&#13;
distributional effects of government intervention relating to interest rates,&#13;
while Section VI looks at interventions which take a more quantitative form.&#13;
Finally, Section VII attempts to define the nature of the interaction between&#13;
formal and informal financial markets which is suggested by the previous&#13;
analysis. Section VIII summarizes the main conclusions, while the one&#13;
appendix identifies a check list of questions which would seem to provide a&#13;
starting point for the analysis of financial sector questions in any&#13;
particular country context.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

II. A ONE SECTOR NEO-CLASSICAL MODEL OF INTERMEDIATION&#13;
It is quite clear that the standard Harrod-Domar or neo-classical&#13;
growth models which underpin so much of our development theory are unable to&#13;
properly incorporate the role of financial intermediation for a large number&#13;
of reasons. These include the assumptions that there is only one sector,&#13;
only one commodity/asset, no uncertainty, no transaction costs, constant&#13;
returns to scale and so on. However, Lewis Spellman 1/ in a recent paper,&#13;
while retaining all these and other assumptions, has opened the way for an&#13;
analysis of intermediation by abandoning the normal neo-classical assumption&#13;
of a fixed-savings ratio. Instead, he adds to the normal relationship an&#13;
additional relationship which determines society's demand to accumlate wealth&#13;
which, in the one commodity/asset model, necessarily takes the form of&#13;
ownership of stocks of the one commodity. Thus the normal steady state&#13;
equilibrium condition that the growth rate of capital and labour should be&#13;
equated, is supplemented by the additional condition that the supply of the&#13;
capital stock (as given by the growth rate) should be equated to the demand&#13;
to own that stock. These two conditions together ensure the endogeneity of&#13;
the savings rate.&#13;
Algebraically, the model can be represented as follows:&#13;
y     = Y(K,L)            (1)&#13;
L/L   =  n                (2)&#13;
K/Y   = W(r)              (3)&#13;
Equation (1), is the linear homogenous production function having&#13;
the standard properties. Equation (2) indicates that the growth of the&#13;
labour force is determined by the (exogenously given) natural rate of growth&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
of population. Equation (3) reflects the fact that the demand to hold wealth&#13;
depends upon the level of real income and the rate of return on such holdings.&#13;
However, since the wealth demand is assumed homogenous of degree one in&#13;
income, it can be represented as the desired ratio of wealth to income which&#13;
in turn is a function of the rate of return. In the simplified world of this&#13;
one asset model, the rate of return on wealth holding is the same as the rate&#13;
of return on capital which, in turn, is assumed equal to the marginal product&#13;
of capital.&#13;
The solution to the model when there is no intermediation is most&#13;
easily shown in the diagrammatic manner suggested by Gonzalez-Vega 2/. This&#13;
is done in Diagram I below.&#13;

Segment 1 of the Diagram shows the familiar neo-classical production&#13;

ratio, and the constant growth rate of the labour force (n). The normal&#13;
(single) condition for steady-state equilibrium would give an equilibrium at&#13;
point A corresponding to a labour:capital ratio of 1. Segment 3 shows the&#13;
demand for wealth holdings (i.e. the desired capital:output ratio), as a&#13;

positive function of the rate of return (i.e. the W function), and the&#13;
technological link, derived from the production function, between the actual&#13;
capital:output ratio and the rate of return (i.e. the T function). The&#13;
equality of desired and actual capital:output ratios is esta_ished at the&#13;
rate of return r. Finally, segment 2, plots the (technologically determined),&#13;
locus of values of the marginal productivity of capital which are associated&#13;
L &#13;
with different values of K ratio.    It is, of course, the case that the rate&#13;
of return established by the equilibrium condition represented the segment 1&#13;
must be consistent with that represented in segment 3.&#13;
Just to illustrate the workings of the model (still without any&#13;
intermediation in it), assume an increase in the growth rate of the labour&#13;
force to n'. In the standard neo-classical argument, this would establish a&#13;
new equilibrium at B, a rise in the labour:capital ratio to 1' and a rise in&#13;
the marginal productivity of capital to r'. However, in Spellman's extended&#13;
model we can see that such an outcome would establish an excess demand for&#13;
wealth equal to w'-w" and so could not be a full equilibrium. Indeed, this&#13;
excess demand would stimulate an increased level of saving, a shift of the&#13;
s locus to - and a new equilibrium at point C.&#13;
But what can this apparatus convey to us about the role of inter-&#13;
mediation? The answer in a strictly rigorous sense is absolutely nothingl&#13;
This model, as with the standard neo-classical apparatus assumes away vir-&#13;
tually all the features of real world economies which make financial inter-&#13;
mediation an interesting subject of analysis. The producers in the model are&#13;
the same people as the wealth-holders and no intermediary is needed to convey&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
savings from one to the other. Transaction costs are zero, so no medium of&#13;
exchange function needs to be discharged. The combination of zero transaction&#13;
costs and no uncertainty means that real commodities represent a perfectly&#13;
good way of storing wealth, and there is no need for financial assets for&#13;
this purpose even if the model were to admit of their existence. There is&#13;
really '"thLb 'or financial assets or a financial sector to do.&#13;
In other words, if the model is to say anything about intermedia-&#13;
tion, it can only do so by virtue of some departure from the formal rigidity&#13;
of the strict neo-classical assumptions or by the importation of some deus&#13;
ex machina. Spellman in fact proceeds by assuming some unspecified imper-&#13;
fection which causes a dispersion of rates of return as between different&#13;
producers. This allows intermediaries a role in channelling resources from&#13;
low return to high return sectors, thereby raising the aggregate marginal&#13;
productivity of capital for any given capital intensity. This, by definition,&#13;
implies an outward shift of the T function in the manner indicated in Diagram&#13;
2. He labels this the allocation effect.&#13;
As Gonzalez-Vega (4) pointed out in his comments on Spellman's&#13;
paper, it is of the essence of this particular role for financial inter-&#13;
mediaries that it will cause the MPK schedule (segment 2) to move out by a&#13;
greater proportion than the v, or APK schedule of segment 1. Thus the new&#13;
equilibrium which takes account of the allocation effect involves a higher&#13;
rate of return than previously. Furthermore the higher productivity of&#13;
aggregate capital will cheapen capital relative to labour and so encourage&#13;
a lower equilibrium labour:capital ratio than 1. this tendency will be&#13;
reinforced by the stimulus to the savings rate caused by the higher rate of&#13;
s          s&#13;
of return and the associated shift of the   , line to   ,.  In brief then,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
the impact of the allocation effect arising from the emergence and/or expan-&#13;
sion of financial intermediaries is:&#13;
(i) a higher rate of return (r' rather than r)&#13;
kii) a lower labour:capital ratio (1' rather than 1)&#13;
(iii) a higher savings ratio (s' rather than s).&#13;
As always with neo-classical fables, one can get somewhat different&#13;
conclusions by eliminating some of the elasticity which the unabridged model&#13;
assumes. If, for exhample, the capital and labour mix did not respond to&#13;
changes in their relative price, then conclusion (ii) would disappear, end&#13;
intermediation would cause a discrepancy between the growth rate of labour&#13;
and capital which in turn might result in a higher growth rate if we begdn&#13;
from an initial disequilibrium position characterised by unemployment of&#13;
labour. Similarly if the interest elasticity of saving were zero, then che&#13;
impact of intermediation would be to generate an inadequacy of wealth holders'&#13;
demand relative to the available capital stock, and a higher rate of return&#13;
on that capital which saving did make available.&#13;
Spellman also considers what he terms the intermediation effect&#13;
which is the stimulus to saving which financial intermediaries provide by&#13;
making available a wide range of assets catering to the wide variety of&#13;
reasons why individuals choose to store wealth. This effect is represented,&#13;
in Gonzales-Vega terms, by a leftward shift of the W function as shown in&#13;
Diagram 2. (Any other influences on aggregate saving which are not incor-&#13;
porated in Equiation 3 could also be shown in this way.) Without going fully&#13;
into the diagrammatic exposition one can fairly easily see that the effects&#13;
of the shift alone are:&#13;

(v) a lower capital:labour ratio (to 1")&#13;

It will be noted that the second and third results ot the inter-&#13;
mediation effect are the same as the second and third results of the alloca-&#13;
tion effect. However, there is an ambiguity concerning the rate of return:&#13;
this could either rise or fall because of the activities of financial inter-&#13;
mediaries depending upon the relative strengths of allocation and intermedia-&#13;
tion effects.&#13;
Finally, we turn to an issue which is extremely important from&#13;
the viewpoint of subsequent discussion, namely the costs of operating the&#13;
financial intermediaries. For the moment we will treat these as pure adminis-&#13;
trative costs which incorporate no elements of monopoly profit or return for&#13;
risk bearing. The position is then as illustrated in Diagram 3 which merely&#13;
magnifies segment 3 of the earlier diagrams.&#13;

The solid lines T' and W' now represent the position after inter-&#13;
mediation has been allowed for. The vertical distance between T' and T'-c&#13;
represents the genuine administrative costs of the intermediaries. Allowing&#13;
for these costs generates the following results:&#13;
(vii) a discrepancy between the rate of return on&#13;
capital (r') and the interest rate (d) which&#13;
intermediaries can pay to suppliers of funds;&#13;
(viii) an increase in the rate of return on capital from&#13;
r to r'; and by connecting these results to those&#13;
shown in segment 1 of the complete diagram;&#13;
(ix) an increae in the labour:capital ratio;&#13;
(x) a decrease in the savings ratio.&#13;
What overall conclusions can we then draw about the role of finan-&#13;
cial intermediaries as analysed in this neo-classical framework?    First, and&#13;
notwithstanding the artificialities involved, it is useful to use this as the&#13;
point of departure because it immediately links financial issues into a mode&#13;
of analysis which is a familiar part of the tool-kit of the majority of&#13;
economists, and one which provides a basis for so much of development theory.&#13;
Second, provided that the neo-classical elasticity assumptions are satisfied&#13;
to even a modest degree, it is already clear that financial intermediation&#13;
will have an unambiguous effect on both the mix of factors of production and&#13;
the size of the savings ratio. Finally, the costs of administering the&#13;
financial institutions, which in this simple case is a measure of their&#13;
efficiency, will reduce savings and increase the labour:intensity of produc-&#13;
tion relative to the position when zero costs are assumed.&#13;

III. THE INTRODUCTION OF IMPERFECTIONS 3/&#13;
If one goes back to absolute fundamentals and asks what conditions&#13;
are necessa    in order for an economy to benefit from the introduction of&#13;
even a simple financial asset such as "money", then the answer is that there&#13;
are four conditions, namely:&#13;
(a) the separation of the sale and purchase transactions of&#13;
individual agents through time;&#13;
(b) uncertainty about the future;&#13;
(c) imperfect information;&#13;
(d) the presence of transaction costs. 4/&#13;
It is ironic that, although these four items are fundamental to the&#13;
very existence of a monetary and financial sector, many theoretical approaches&#13;
to monetary problems abstract from all of them. (Most theoretical growth&#13;
models incorporating money are guilty of this.) Notwithstanding its virtues,&#13;
the Spellman model abstracts from most of the four fundamentals, and this and&#13;
the next four sections of the paper are devoted to a modest attempt to remedy&#13;
this omission.&#13;
It is already clear from Diagram 3 above that even the introduction&#13;
of the pure administrative costs of the financial institutions (hereafter&#13;
referred to as banks for short), will have the effect of raising the equi-&#13;
librium MPK, establishing a discrepancy between this and the deposit interest&#13;
rate (d) and lowering both the equilibrium savings rate and the capital:output&#13;
ratio. It immediately follows that the emergence of "better" banks having&#13;
lower operating costs would reverse these effects. In this section, we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
propose to enlarge upon this simple insight by considering a range of tran-&#13;
saction costs other than those of operating the banks, and by casting some&#13;
of the imperfections just listed into transaction cost terms.&#13;
The T' function of Diagram 3 is already an outward shift of an&#13;
earlier function which assumed no financial intermediation. We now argue&#13;
that there are four inward shifts of that function that also need to be&#13;
considered, especially in an LDC context. These are:&#13;
(i) The shift associated with the pure administrative costs&#13;
of running the banks. This is already shown in Diagram 3&#13;
as T'-c.&#13;
(ii) The shift associated with the transaction costs of borrowing&#13;
incurred by the borrower, e.g. the time spent travelling to&#13;
the, possibly, distant lending institution, legal fees, etc.&#13;
(iii) The shift associated with the uncertainty which the borrower&#13;
himself attaches to the expected return on his investment&#13;
projects. For example, if this expected return is r', he&#13;
will not be prepared to borrow at rate r' in the presence&#13;
of uncertainty, even if his genuine transaction costs are&#13;
zero. He will require a lower borrowing rate.&#13;
(iv) The shift associated with the uncertainty which the bank&#13;
attaches to the borrowers declared expectation of rate of&#13;
return. With the chronic imperfections of information&#13;
which characterise many LDCs, this will often not be&#13;
based on a realistic evaluation of risks and will often&#13;
be excessively large.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
The first three of these shifts are clearly additive and are legiti-&#13;
mately seen as adjustments to the demand schedule. The fourth is unlikely to&#13;
be fully additive with the other three and the distance between adjusted&#13;
demand curves (iii) and (iv) should be taken as representing the additional&#13;
shift which point (iv) makes necessary. This could be zero in some cases&#13;
where the borrower evaluates risk very highly or has high transaction costs.&#13;
It should be stressed that the supply schedule of Diagram 3, repre-&#13;
sents the supply of investment funds from ultimate wealth holders (the adjust-&#13;
ment to turn it into the supply schedule of funds from the banks involves a&#13;
vertical downward shift to reflect items (i) and (iv) above) either for direct&#13;
self-financing or indirectly through the financial system. As in Spellman,&#13;
this depends only on the real return on capital, and even an imperfectly&#13;
functioning financial system (which suffers from all of points (a) through&#13;
(d) on page 10) will be better than no financial system since it will assured-&#13;
ly produce an equilibrium supply greater than w. Thus our four inward shifts&#13;
are constrained not to take us beyond this point.&#13;
If we aggregate those shifts into two classes: those affecting&#13;
ultimate borrowers and those affecting banks, we obtain the picture shown in&#13;
Diagram 4 (which also inverts Diagram 3 and linearises the functions so as to&#13;
simplify the diagrammatic presentation).&#13;
In diagram 4 the T'(a) function is to be interpreted as the maximum&#13;
rates of interest which borrowers are prepared to pay to finance projects&#13;
having real rates of return indicated by the part of the T' schedule vertic-&#13;
ally above. T'(b) is to be interpreted as the maximum rates at which banks&#13;
are prepared to borrow money in order to on-lend to borrowers willing to pay&#13;
the interest rates indicated by that part of the T'(a) schedule vertically&#13;
above.&#13;

DIAGRAM 4. THE AGGREGATE EFFECTS OF TRANSACTION COSTS AND UNCERTAINTY&#13;
b~~ ~ __-____ '___'_A&#13;
In a world of no uncertainty and zero transaction costs, an equX-&#13;
librum would be attained at point A and this would be characterised by equal-&#13;
ity of the real rate of return on capital, the interest rate paid by borrowers&#13;
and the interest rate paid by banks to ultimate wealth holders. Allowing&#13;
for the various types of friction which we have identified, the equilibrium&#13;
shifts to point B and compared with A this is clearly characterized by:&#13;
(i)  a higher MPK (r' rather than r);&#13;
(ii) an excess of the interest rate paid by ultimate borrowers&#13;
over the interest rate received by wealth holders (i.e.&#13;
b &gt; d);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
(iii) a lower equilibrium level of wealth holding relative to&#13;
income (i.e. W" &lt; W').&#13;
The shaded area of Diagram 4 now incorporates two things. Firstly,&#13;
it includes the saving of real resources inherent in the lower level of&#13;
intermediation at B as compared with A. Secondly, it includes the loss of&#13;
"surplus" (This loss of "surplus" is associated with a lower level of output&#13;
per head, but since the savings rate also falls, it is not clear whether&#13;
consumption per head will fall or rise. It is only in this ambiguous sense&#13;
that we can relate this loss of surplus to a loss of welfare.) resulting from&#13;
the fact that the lower level of intermediation at B partly arises from the&#13;
uncertainty element included in the gap between T' and T'(b), and so does&#13;
not result in any saving of real resources. When we add to this the fact&#13;
that many of the real resources saved at B will have a low social opportunity&#13;
cost, it is reasonable to contend that the bulk of the shaded area represents&#13;
a loss of social welfare.&#13;
The allocative role of new and improved financial intermediaries&#13;
(including new forms of collateral) in the development process is now made&#13;
abundantly clear. This role is to reduce the transaction costs and to&#13;
progressively eliminate the sources of uncertainty and imperfect information&#13;
which underlie the vertical distances between T'(a), T'(b) and T'. To the&#13;
extent that this happens, there is a gain in welfare as well as the macro-&#13;
economic effects already recounted in the discussion of costs in the Spellman&#13;
model. Since the imperfections are often substantial, these effects are&#13;
potentially large. Furthermore, they can arise quite independently of any&#13;
changes in the state of non-financial technical progress (which we have taken&#13;
to be constant) as reflected in the position of the unadjusted T function.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -&#13;
In short, if we accept the presence of large imperfections in the money and&#13;
capital markets of LDCs, there is every reason to expect that the financial&#13;
sector can be an initiating influence in the process of development rather&#13;
than a merely passive one as is often assumed.&#13;
IV. A TWO SECTOR MODEL WITH IMPERFECTIONS&#13;
Besides the generalized effects which we have just considered, it&#13;
is also useful to consider the sectoral consequences of a financial system&#13;
which is expanding or failing to expand. For expository purposes we will&#13;
confine ourselves to two sectors to which we attach the labels "modern" and&#13;
"traditional". While these may coincide with the modern and traditional&#13;
sectors of conventional usage, there is no necessity for them to do so.&#13;
There is, of course, an implicit sectorisation between low and&#13;
high productivity (of capital) sectors already built into Spellman's analysis:&#13;
it is this which explains how intermediation can move the T function outward&#13;
from the origin. A recent paper by Vincente Galbis (2) has made this dis-&#13;
tinction explicit and thereby derived some valuable results about the working&#13;
of the financial system. However, the high productivity/low productivity&#13;
distinction is completely lacking in any operational significance. The&#13;
sectorisations which are typically available and which reflect socio-economic&#13;
or geographic distinctions, cut right across this distinction.    The low&#13;
productivity sector is simply not an identifiable grouping and so we are&#13;
unlikely to be able to devise policies towards it. By contrast, those groups&#13;
which suffer excessively from a high uncertainty and transaction cost disad-&#13;
vantage, are identifiabie 5/ and in this sense a sectoral definition based on&#13;
this distinction may have considered operational value.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
In our two sector example, we assume (realistically) that the&#13;
modern sector is affected by uncertainty and transaction cost influences to&#13;
a far lower degree than is the traditional sector. Thus the technically&#13;
determined demand curve for capital funds of this sector (i.e. its T function)&#13;
is shifted inwards by these factors, to a much smaller extent than is the&#13;
corresponding demand curve of the traditional sector. The position is shown&#13;
in Diagram 5.&#13;
The lines DT and DM show the MPK schedules of the traditional and&#13;
modern sectors respectively, while the line labelled Total Demand is their&#13;
lateral summation and corresponds to the T' function used earlier. For&#13;
purposes of exposition DT is shown lying below Dm, but this ordering could&#13;
be reversed without affecting our main conclusions. The lines DT/ and DM1&#13;
show the inward shifts of the two demand curves associated with the various&#13;
uncertainties and imperfections which ar listed on page 11. To reduce the&#13;
congestion of the diagram, we assume that the transactions and uncertainties&#13;
impinging on ultimate borrowers of funds are zero. However, the consequences&#13;
of abandoning this assumption are easy to see. Finally, the supply schedule&#13;
in Diagram 5 has the same interpretation as that in Diagram 4.&#13;
&#13;

In the absence of all transaction costs and imperfections, equillb-&#13;
rium in the capital markets is' established at Point A. This equilibrium in-&#13;
volves certain familiar characteristics, namely:&#13;
(i) equality of the rate of return on capital in the two&#13;
sectors (at rate Re);&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
(ii) a common interest rate (namely Re) to ultimate wealth-&#13;
holders and to borrowers in both markets;&#13;
(iii)  a large use of capital in the sector assumed to have the&#13;
higher demand curve i.e. OM &gt; OT.&#13;
When we allow for transaction costs and imperfections, the equi-&#13;
K&#13;
librium moves to point B and the overall K ratio falls by an amount OS-OS'.&#13;
If the banks are allowed to ration out the reduced level of lending by price,&#13;
then the level of capital use in the traditional sector will fall to OT',&#13;
while that in the modern sector will fall to OM'. The other conclusions&#13;
which emerge very clearly from the diagram are:&#13;
(iv) the fall in lending to the traditional sector exceeds&#13;
that to the modern sector, i.e. T-T' &gt; M-M';&#13;
(v)  the equilibrium lending rate to the traditional sector now&#13;
exceeds that to the modern sector, i.e. RLT &gt; \ M;&#13;
(vi)  the loss of welfare which is incorporated in the shaded&#13;
area of the diagram falls disproportionately on the&#13;
traditional sector.&#13;
Since all three conclusions depend only on the vertial distances&#13;
between the adjusted and unadjusted demand curves, it is clear that we could&#13;
reverse the positions of the traditional and modern sector demand curves&#13;
without changing these conclusions.&#13;
If the banks were not allowed to "discriminate"* in their lending&#13;
rates **, then market clearing would require the establishment of the common&#13;
* The term "discrimination" is slightly misleading in this context since&#13;
the higher lending rate to the traditional sector is partly explained&#13;
in terms of the higher real resource cost of such lending.&#13;
** A less profitable situation for the banks since it implies inequality&#13;
between the marginaL costs and returns on lending in both markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
lending rate at Re' which, of course, still exceeds RB . However, in this&#13;
case the traditional sector would suffer a rather smaller fall in lending and&#13;
loss of surplus, relative to the modern sector than in the previous case.&#13;
Indeed the relative magnitudes of these falls/losses would depend entirely&#13;
on the relative elasticities of the two unadjusted demand curves. If the&#13;
unadjusted demand curve of the traditional sector were less elastic than&#13;
that of the modern sector, then it would enjoy an absolutely smaller fall in&#13;
lending than the modern sector.&#13;
Given the divergence between the profit maximisation behaviour of&#13;
the banks (i.e. price discrimination) and the behaviour which minimises the&#13;
relative disadvantage of the traditional sector, it is interesting to specu-&#13;
late-about how the banks might behave in practice. Since, in many economies,&#13;
the banks would wish to avoid open price discrimination against the tradi-&#13;
tional sector, even assuming this to be legally possible, it seems reasonable&#13;
to conjecture that they might pursue their profit maximising objective by&#13;
"discriminating" against the traditional sector in relation to condlitions of&#13;
lending other than price (e.g. repayment terms, security conditions, etc.).&#13;
This being the case, the distributional consequences of transaction costs and&#13;
imperfections would persist notwithstanding the apparent equalisation of&#13;
lending rates as between sectors.&#13;
Finally in this section, we need to consider how the propositions&#13;
deduced earlier might be affected by rather different assumptions about supply&#13;
elasticities. If we take the extreme case where the supply elasticity with&#13;
respect to the rate of return is zero, then the equilibrium, in the presence&#13;
of transaction costs, moves to point C. This implies a smaller reduction in&#13;
lending to the traditional sector than with equilibrium at B, and some&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
increase in lending to the modern sector. In this case, transaction costs&#13;
impose no aggregate welfare loss on the economy, but they do cause a diver-&#13;
gence in borrowing and lending rates as well as the distributive effects&#13;
referred to earlier. In short, our qualitative conclusions are virtually&#13;
unchanged by the assumption of zero supply elasticity.&#13;
The main conclusion which we draw from the analysis of the section&#13;
is that transaction costs and other frictions in the operation of financial&#13;
markets can impose a distributional cost on society in addition to the over-&#13;
all loss of welfare for which they are responsible. While this distribu-&#13;
tional effect does depend upon whether or not financial institutions choose,&#13;
or are allowed, to "discriminate" in their lending rates as between sectors,&#13;
the absence of such discrimination does not necessarily mean the absence of&#13;
such an effect. This is because financial institutions have other means of&#13;
discriminating besides price and will certainly fallback on the use of such&#13;
devices if profit maximisation is their dominant goal. The sectorisation&#13;
which is adopted does have operational meaning in that coherent groups which&#13;
are differentiated by their (broadly defined) transaction costs of operating&#13;
in financial markets are capable of being identified, and financial policies&#13;
towards them are capable of being devised.&#13;
V. THE EFFECTS OF ADMINISTRATIVE INTERVENTION ON INTEREST RATES&#13;
It is fairly clear from both the Spellman model and indeed the&#13;
Galbis 6/ model referred to earlier, what the effects of administrative&#13;
restrictions on interest rates will be. In Galbis, for example, such&#13;
restrictions will lower the overall rate of return associated with a given&#13;
level of savings and real investment. In Spellman, the restriction will&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
cause the desired capital: output ratio (as determined by the savings&#13;
decision of ultimate wealth holders), to fall below that which producers will&#13;
demand given their production possibilities and the cost of credit. The&#13;
result will be a discrepancy between the interest rate received by savers and&#13;
the real rate of return on capital, a lower level of saving and a higher&#13;
labour:capital ratio. It should be noticed that lower interest rates do not&#13;
cause greater capital intensity because of the assumed effect of these lower&#13;
rates on aggregate savings.&#13;
Our own analysis of the previous two sections suggests three&#13;
additional points about the administration of interest rates. First, in some&#13;
LDCs it is possible that the setting of a given rate will have no effect at&#13;
all because that rate may be set in the, potentially wide, area between the&#13;
T' and the T'(b) areas of Diagram 4. So an intervention which may have&#13;
caused an excess demand in a situation of no transaction costs and zero&#13;
uncertainty, may cause no effects when these factors are important, for the&#13;
simple reason that the effective demand will be so much lower in the latter&#13;
case.* At the policy level the implication is that it is not valid to&#13;
criticise an administered interest rate just because it is lower than the&#13;
scarcity price of capital as reflected in the rate of return (or the MPK).&#13;
In an LDC context one would normally expect the deposit interest rates to be&#13;
significantly lower than this. Furthermore, the comparison needs to be made&#13;
* It is also conceivable that the administered interest rate may be set&#13;
below the equilibrium level of the MPK which could be achieved in the&#13;
complete absence of financial intermediaries (,i.e. r in Diagram 1).&#13;
However, in this case, there will be some redundancy in the restriction&#13;
on rates since the actual MPK clearly cannot fall below this level even&#13;
under conditions of extreme financial repression.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
at the equilibrium position, bearing in mind that the rate of return in a&#13;
situation of excess demand is higher than that in equilibrium.&#13;
Secondly, our earlier conclusions about the beneficial effects of&#13;
improved financial intermediaries and the gain in welfare which they could&#13;
bring by reducing transaction costs and offsetting uncertainty, have far less&#13;
force in a situation of administered interest rates. In particular, if the&#13;
initial position is already characterised by an excess demand for funds&#13;
(arising because of administered rates), then such improvements will merely&#13;
exacerbate that excess demand. Even if the administered rate has not ini-&#13;
tially resulted in excess demand, then a financial improvement may create&#13;
such an excess if the outward movement of the adjusted demand curve which,&#13;
by definition, it causes (see Diagram 5), is such as to determine an equilib-&#13;
rium deposit rate higher than the administered one. Either way it is clear&#13;
that the benefits of financial technical progress, either engineered or&#13;
spontaneous, can be frustrated by inappropriate interest rate policies.&#13;
Equally, since non-financial technical progress will cause an outward shift&#13;
of the T function of Spellman's analysis (i.e. the unadjusted demand curve&#13;
of Diagram 5), the benefits of this can also be frustrated by such policies.&#13;
Thirdly, while many different rationing schemes might be devised&#13;
to deal with an excess demand caused by an administered interest rate, it is&#13;
clear that any such scheme which is left entirely to the banks to devise,&#13;
will often have distributional consequences favouring the modern sector. In&#13;
particular, take the case where the banks are controlled both as to their&#13;
deposit rates and their on-lending rates. In this situation loans will be&#13;
allocated first to those groups having the lower transaction costs and the&#13;
lower degree of uncertainty attached to their projects: the modern sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
in our analysis. It is only if the demands of this sector (adjusted for&#13;
borrower transaction costs and uncertainty) at the controlled lending rate&#13;
are lower than the aggregate supply of funds at the controlled deposit rate,&#13;
that any funds will be left over for the traditional sector. 7/ In Diagram&#13;
5, for example, any lending rate set below the level associated with the&#13;
intersection marked D, would completely exclude the traditional sector&#13;
from receiving a share of the supply of funds. It can be seen, certainly&#13;
from our example, that this critical rate need not be far below the equilib-&#13;
rium rate. Thus even a small deviation from the equilibrium rate can cause&#13;
this exclusion effect.&#13;
The arrangement which a system of interest rate controls (with the&#13;
rationing scheme under the control of the banks) would have to incorporate in&#13;
order to avoid this squeezing out of the traditional sector is clear enough.&#13;
It would have to allow the banks not only a spread between lending and borrow-&#13;
ing rates but a spread which could be differentiated as between different&#13;
classes of borrowers (i.e. higher for the traditional sector in our example).&#13;
Unfortunately this is the exact opposite of what is normally politically&#13;
acceptable in an LDC context. Without such a component, however, interest&#13;
rate controls seem certain to impinge unevenly, and drastically, on those&#13;
sectors which, like our traditional sector, are disadvantaged in terms of&#13;
transaction costs and uncertainty. Even if there is no elasticity in the&#13;
supply schedule, it is not possible to sustain the opposite opinion (which&#13;
is often heard) that low interest rates benefit these sectors. In this case&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
of fixed supply, the level of credit demand in the modern sector will&#13;
increase as interest rates are administratively lowered and so preempt a&#13;
larger part of the fixed total supply.&#13;
VI. QUANTITATIVE INTERVENTION IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS&#13;
The other form of administrative interventions which we need to&#13;
consider relates to quantity controls in the form of the preempting of a&#13;
certain part of the total supply of funds for the use of the government&#13;
proper or its quasi-commercial offshoots. This form of intervention is&#13;
extremely common in LDCs and can take a number of different forms. Examples&#13;
include the imposition of cash reserve requirements on the banks (often&#13;
heavily in excess of prudential requirements), rules to the effect that&#13;
banks and other financial institutions must hold some part of their deposits&#13;
in the form of government securities, rules to require commercial lending&#13;
institutions to channel part of their funds to non-commercial public lending&#13;
agencies, compulsory contractual savings schemes channelling funds predomi-&#13;
nantly to government, and so on. In some of these cases (e.g. contractual&#13;
savings schemes), it is at least arguable that the government intervention&#13;
will increase the aggregate supply of saving. In other cases (e.g. cash&#13;
ratios) there is absolutely no reason why this should happen.&#13;
Bearing this distinction in mind, we can explore some of the logical&#13;
implications of quantity intervention by a further elaboration of the Spell-&#13;
man diagram as already developed in Section IV and Diagram 5. This is done&#13;
in Diagram 6 in which we consider the aggregate demand curves from Diagram 5,&#13;
but now recognize the disaggregation of these aggregates into private and&#13;
government. Thus the lines labelled Dp and Dp' are the demand curves for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
capital in the private sector before and after allowance for transaction&#13;
costs and uncertainty. So Dp' shows the maximum rates at which the banks&#13;
would be prepared to borrow funds in order to on-lend to private sector&#13;
projects having returns indicated by the part of the Dp function which is&#13;
vertically above. Again for reasons of diagrammatic presentation, we ignore&#13;
the transaction costs and uncertainty attaching to the borrower. The Dg line&#13;
in Diagram 6 shows the demand curves for capital in the government sector.&#13;
We make the reasonably realistic assumption that the transaction costs&#13;
associated with government borrowing are low enough to be unimportant, and&#13;
that the uncertainty associated with such lending is also minimal. Thus Dg&#13;
is at one and the same time the adjusted and the unadjusted demand curve.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
As was the case in Diagram 5, points B and A are the equilibria&#13;
with and without allowance for transaction costs etc., respectively, and&#13;
OS' and OS are the corresponding levels of capital used in the aggregate&#13;
economy. At B, in the absence of any government intervention, funds are&#13;
allocated as to OG1 to government and OP1 to the private sector. The&#13;
differential transaction costs and uncertainty which attach to the two&#13;
sectors means that banks charge the private sector RLp for credit as against&#13;
RLG to the government: the latter rate also being the borrowing rate of the&#13;
banks given our assumptions. In other words the private sector already&#13;
suffers certain natural disadvantages in the financial markets even in the&#13;
absence of government intervention.&#13;
Now assume that the government intervenes quantitatively in the&#13;
financial markets in one or more of the ways listed earlier and thereby&#13;
preempts a part of the total supply of funds equal to OG 2. Assume further&#13;
that the average interest rate at which these funds are made available to&#13;
government is equal to RLGI. Two things seem to follow. First if the aggre-&#13;
gate equilibrium remains at B, the private sector will suffer a fall in its&#13;
availability of funds equal to OG 2-O0, and since this will move the private&#13;
sector leftwards along its demand curve, its equilibrium borrowing rate will&#13;
rise.  Secondly, the banks are making a loss on the preempted funds OG2 (in&#13;
effect they are being taxed on these at the rate RB-RLG.), and will try to&#13;
recoup at least part of this by raising the margins on non-government lending.&#13;
(This does of course depend on a suitably low price elasticity of the private&#13;
sectors demand curve.) For consistency with, the earlier argument, we can say&#13;
that the intervention of government imposes another cost on the banks which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
can be represented by a further inward shift of the aggregate demand curve to&#13;
what we have labelled Total Demand (post-tax). This will establish a new&#13;
equilibrium at C which is characterised by a lower aggregate supply of credit&#13;
and, since the preempted funds going to government are unchanged, a lower&#13;
level of private sector lending than at B. (Assuming some elasticity in the&#13;
supply schedule.) There will also be yet a further widening of the differen-&#13;
tial between private sector and governmental borrowing rates.&#13;
The only way in which this relatively unfavourable set of results&#13;
for the private sector might be avoided is in the case where the scheme which&#13;
the government sets up to preempt funds causes the aggregate supply of funds&#13;
to increase (i.e. shifts the supply schedule to the right). This can happen.&#13;
Compulsory social security arrangements, for example, might often establish&#13;
new motives for an individual to save rather than catering for established&#13;
motives and so merely replace existing savings outlets. However it is wrong&#13;
to believe (as the governments imposing them invariably do), that such schemes&#13;
will necessarily have this effect: quite frequently there is no reason at all&#13;
to expect it. In addition, the evaluation of these arrangements should not&#13;
be based solely on the question of whether or not the savings function shifts&#13;
but should also take account of the costs which the analysis of this section&#13;
has hopefully identified.&#13;
Several additional insights can be extracted from the broad analysis&#13;
of government intervention which this section has developed. First, quanti-&#13;
tative restrictions are, in practice, often used jointly with interest rate&#13;
restrictions. In this case it seems very clear from our earlier analysis&#13;
that the squeeze on private sector lending caused by quantity controls will&#13;
fall disproportionately on sectors, such as our traditional sector, which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
have disproportionately high transaction cost and uncertainty characteristics.&#13;
Following on from this, one of the reasons why governments often preempt&#13;
funds in the manner indicated in Diagram 6 is because they propose to channel&#13;
some part of these funds to disadvantaged sectors. In this respect the&#13;
government is in some danger of operating on both sides of the ball game&#13;
since it may be through inappropriate financial policies that much of the&#13;
disadvantage of these sectors arises. (Another way of putting it is to say&#13;
that selective credit policies, because of the way they are administered,&#13;
can have aggregate effects which may partially offset the benefits of the&#13;
intended selectivity).&#13;
Finally, one can begin to see how difficulties in the financial&#13;
sector interlink with general questions of economic management. Imagine, for&#13;
example, that the government is unhappy with the intensity of the credit&#13;
squeeze which its quantitative intervention imposes on the private sector.&#13;
It if reduces the level of such intervention but does not reduce its own&#13;
expenditures then the credit squeeze is merely transferred to government.&#13;
But government can offset this by greater use of inflationary methods of&#13;
finance or by increased foreign borrowing. In the first case the problems&#13;
associated with an administered nominal interest rate are intensified by the&#13;
fall in the real rate of interest which the resulting acceleration of&#13;
inflation will cause. In the second case, a dependence on external financial&#13;
markets is established which might have been unnecessary if government&#13;
projects had been evaluated at "correct" interest rates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

VII. THE ROLE OF INFORMAL FINANCIAL MARKETS&#13;
In all of the foregoing argument, the savings of an economy have&#13;
been assumed to find their way into real investment either through self-&#13;
financing (i.e. the agent responsible for the saving also being responsible&#13;
for the investment), or via one integrated financial sector (which we have&#13;
termed the "banks", for short). But the financial sector of a typical LDC&#13;
will normally not be of this form but will comprise at least two non-integ-&#13;
rated components which we will term "formal" and "informal" markets. (Sepa-&#13;
rate financial institutions within the formal sector will be non-integrated&#13;
to the extent that they succeed in differentiating their products. However,&#13;
this is of a wholly lower degree from that which prevails as between formal&#13;
and informal sectors.) In this section, we examine how our approach to&#13;
financial sector issues can guide us towards some conclusion about the nature&#13;
of the interaction between these formal and informal markets.&#13;
We take the view that the informal markets have three fundamental&#13;
distinguishing characteristics (and other characteristics to be discussed in&#13;
a moment). First, their transaction costs of borrowing and lending are far&#13;
lower than those of formal sector institutions serving the same clientele.&#13;
This is partly because they lack expensive infrastructure such as lavish&#13;
marble buildings, but largely because they operate on a local basis, lending&#13;
to and borrowing only from clients in a narrowly circumscribed vicinity.&#13;
(In other words, their costs of information gathering are low.) Their second&#13;
characteristic is that they are extremely successful, either de jure or&#13;
de facto, in avoiding administrative controls on lending and borrowing rates&#13;
which so often shackle the formal sector institutions. Finally, they&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
normally succeed in escaping completely from the implicit taxation of the&#13;
financial sector which arises from the government's preempting of funds&#13;
at sub-equilibrium interest rates. In short, the informal markets are dis-&#13;
tinguishea by their comparative advantage in relation to all three of the&#13;
influences which we have earlier argued to restrict the level of intermedia-&#13;
tion in the economy.&#13;
What this means in practical terms can be represented in our, by&#13;
now familiar, diagram in the following way. In Diagram 7, which shows only&#13;
the total demand curves (with and without transaction costs) and the total&#13;
supply curve, the labelling is exactly the same as in the earlier diagrams.&#13;
Imagine an administered borrowing rate of Ra which restricts formal sector&#13;
lending to OE and, of itself, generates a loss of surplus which can be re-&#13;
presented (subject to the earlier caveats about this) by the area DES'B. If,&#13;
by avoiding the interest rate restriction, the informal sector is able to&#13;
tap into some part of the same funds which are denied to the formal sector&#13;
because of that restriction, then the equilibrium of the economy can be moved&#13;
away from point D and towards point B, thereby capturing some of the surplus&#13;
which is otherwise lost. In the process the informal sector will be able to&#13;
charge a relatively wide margin for its on-lending of funds equal to the&#13;
vertical distance between the unadjusted total demand curve and the supply&#13;
function. Despite the social benefits of the lending, this margin might well&#13;
appear to be exploitive in a situation where Ra is set very low relative to&#13;
Re. It is also in the nature of the informal sector that the bulk of its&#13;
lending will go to the traditional sector a9d that as a result the bulk of&#13;
the gain in surplus will accrue there. Thus the informal financial sector&#13;
discharges an important distributional function as well as a generalized&#13;
, , eil q 1e  '&gt;.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
Similarly, imagine a situation of free interest rates with the&#13;
equilibrium of the economy established at point C if the government is inter-&#13;
vening quantitatively and at point B if it is not.&#13;

Once again, if the informal sector is able, by virtue of low trans-&#13;
action costs, to tap into the funds which are denied to the formal sector&#13;
by virtue of its own high transaction costs, then the equilibrium of the&#13;
economy can be moved away from point C or B and towards point A. Depending&#13;
on the magnitude of the informal sector's transaction cost advantage, this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
intervention will enable the economy to capture some part of the surplus&#13;
represented by the area S"CA. While the informal sector, by virtue of its&#13;
local knowledge, will be able to reduce lender risk, it seems unlikely to be&#13;
able to exert much influence on borrower risk. Thus the intervention alone&#13;
will not mobilise the whole of the surplus. However, since loss of surplus&#13;
falls most heavily on the traditional sector, the informal financial markets&#13;
will exert distributional effects which will favour that sector.&#13;
The social function of the unorganized financial markets are thus&#13;
very clear: they restore part of the social welfare lost by virtue of all&#13;
three of the frictions on the operations of capital markets referred to&#13;
earlier, and they distribute income infavour of sectors like our illustrative&#13;
traditional sector which suffer disproportionately from uncertainty, etc.&#13;
If they could discharge this second-best function perfectly, then the case&#13;
for advocating either an end to administered formal interest rates, and the&#13;
implicit taxation of the financial sector, or the development of formal&#13;
financial institutions to reduce transaction costs would be extremely weak.&#13;
However, the informal markets are themselves defective most seriously because&#13;
they are heavily localised in their spheres of operation. This severely&#13;
restricts their access to the economy-wide supply of funds, as well as their&#13;
ability to allocate the funds they do-mobilise in the most efficient manner.&#13;
In addition, not all the funds mobilised by the informal markets will be used&#13;
in the manner so far assumed, namely for investment purposes. A considerable&#13;
part of these funds may be used for relieving some immediate distress or for&#13;
other consumption purposes. In this case far greater complexity is introduced&#13;
regarding the social role of the informal markets, and a doubt arises as to&#13;
the justification for ttie wide margin between borrowing and lendinig rates at&#13;
whicti they rrequXÂ±n .L' oDcrate.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
However, the central conclusion of this section is clear. If we&#13;
place uncertainty, transaction costs and administrative intervention at the&#13;
centre of the stage as we have done throughout this paper, then a simple&#13;
theory about the reasons for the existence of an informal financial sector&#13;
emerges quite naturally. Furthermore, this tells us that policies which are&#13;
designed to improve the formal financial markets (e.g. the introduction of&#13;
new institutions having lower transaction costs, or the ending of some&#13;
aspects of administrative intervention) can now be seen to involve costs as&#13;
well as benefits.. The benefits are those which are apparent from a construct&#13;
like Diagram 5 which considers only the formal markets. The costs arise from&#13;
the contraction of the informal markets which these policies will almost&#13;
certainly cause.  While difficult to evaluate at all precisely, these costs.&#13;
should not be ignored.&#13;
VIII. SUMMARY AND MAIN CONCLUSIONS&#13;
This paper has provided a stylised analysis of the operation of&#13;
financial markets in LDCs when explicit account is taken of the factors which&#13;
render these markets imperfect. The following list draws out the main con-&#13;
clusions of the analysis.&#13;
1.   For a given production function and state of non-financial&#13;
technology, there is a positive role in the development&#13;
process for an improved financial sector associated with&#13;
transferring an increasing quantity of funds from relatively&#13;
low to relatively high yielding inves,tment projects.&#13;
2.   The limits on this role are defined at one end by the&#13;
overall rate of return which would prevail in the absence&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
of financial institutions, and at the other by the&#13;
rate which would prevail when capital markets are&#13;
perfect.&#13;
3.   Between these limits, the positive role for financial&#13;
sector policies depends partly on genuine inefficiency&#13;
(i.e. excessively high use of real resources) in the&#13;
institutions, and partly on intangible factors such&#13;
as the subjective attitude of banks to the riskiness&#13;
of certain classes of loans.&#13;
4.   Certain groups in a typical LDC (e.g. the "traditional"&#13;
sector in our example) will suffer disproportionately&#13;
from the effects of transaction costs, uncertainty, etc.&#13;
This will mean lower levels of equilibrium lending to&#13;
these sectors and higher equilibrium borrowing rates&#13;
than will apply elsewhere. It follows that these groups&#13;
ought to be identified for policy purposes, and that&#13;
financial sector policies can benefit these groups dis-&#13;
proportionately.&#13;
5.   The "natural" disadvantages of these groups in financial&#13;
markets does depend on the pricing arrangements which the&#13;
banks are allowed. However, even when discriminatory&#13;
pricing is ruled out, it seems highly probable that the&#13;
results referred to under point 4 will be achieved by the&#13;
banks, by a differentiation of conditions of lending&#13;
other than price.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 -&#13;
6.   In evaluating an administered interest rate, it is not&#13;
correct to argue that this should be equal to the&#13;
scarcity price of capital as reflected by the real rate&#13;
of return. In an LDC context the equilibrium (borrowing)&#13;
interest rate can diverge from the real rate of return&#13;
depending on the magnitude of the real and subjective&#13;
components of the imperfections which we identify. This&#13;
divergence could be extremely large.&#13;
7.   An administered interest rate which is set below the&#13;
equilibrium interest rate will eliminate the potential&#13;
and positive role for intermediation as summarized in&#13;
point 3. Improved intermediation in this situation will&#13;
merely exacerbate an excess demand situation and increase&#13;
the discrepancy between bank lending and borrowing rates.&#13;
8.   In the same situation, it is highly probably that credit&#13;
rationing would impose a disproportionate fall in lending&#13;
on disadvantaged sectors such as our illustrative "tradi-&#13;
tional" sector. This could only be avoided if the control&#13;
on interest rates allowed the banks a larger spread between&#13;
lending and borrowing rates in relation to this sector than&#13;
to others. This is the exact opposite of the arrangement&#13;
which political considerations would normally enforce.&#13;
There is no theoretical reason to expect that artificially&#13;
low interest rates will benefit disadvantaged sectors.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
9.   While LDC governments intervene quantitatively in finan-&#13;
cial markets in a number of ways, the effect is invariably&#13;
to provide government with at least part of its capital&#13;
fund requirements at lower than equilibrium interest rates.&#13;
That is, this intervention implies a tax on financial&#13;
institutions.&#13;
10. The private sector operates in financial markets on a&#13;
relatively unfavourable basis compared with government&#13;
even in the absence of any quantitative intervention.&#13;
To the extent that banks pass on the tax implied by such&#13;
intervention, then the private sector position is further&#13;
worsened both in that it receives less funds, and in that&#13;
it pays a high borrowing rate than before.&#13;
11. This burden on the private sector is made yet worse if&#13;
government, because of its ability to extract funds at&#13;
sub-equilibrium rates, evaluates its capital. projects&#13;
incorrectly and so extracts a higher absolute quantity&#13;
of funds than it would have done if paying the equilibrium&#13;
borrowing rate.&#13;
12. If quantitative intervention exists side by side with an&#13;
administered interest rate, then point 8 above makes it&#13;
clear that the private sector burden of such intervention&#13;
will fall disproportionately on the disadvantaged part of&#13;
the private sector. If government funds are partly used&#13;
to subsidise such sectors. then there is an inherent&#13;
contradiction in Rovernment Dolicy in that the size ot&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -&#13;
the necessary subsidy is certainly increased by government&#13;
financial policies.&#13;
13. While these unfavourable results for quantitative inter-&#13;
ventions would certainly be modified if these interventions&#13;
also produced an increased supply of funds (i.e.,shift in&#13;
the savings schedule), many of the more familiar forms of&#13;
such intervention cannot reasonably be expected to produce&#13;
this result.&#13;
14. The emergence and expansion of an informal financial&#13;
sector can reasonably be seen as a reaction to the three&#13;
major sources of friction on the effective operation of&#13;
formal financial markets (i.e. transaction costs, imper-&#13;
fect information etc.; interest rate administration; and&#13;
the implicit taxation of the financial sector). To the&#13;
extent that these frictions impose a burden on society,&#13;
the informal sector discharges a valuable social function&#13;
at the same time as operating with, possibly, high margins&#13;
between its borrowing and lending rates.&#13;
15. It follows that the benefits associated with better formal&#13;
financial institutions, lower implicit taxation of the&#13;
financial sector and so on, will be partially offset by&#13;
the contraction of the informal markets to which such&#13;
improvements give rise.&#13;

            Capital market imperfections and economic development
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The first paper - Interest Rate,
            Transaction Costs and Financial Innovations - seeks to
            provide an overall perspective for research in the area of
            capital market imperfections and economic development.
            Capital market is - must be - imperfect in the sense in
            which economists use this term; for it involves a
            relationship in time between the lender and the borrower in
            the context of uncertainty. However, it does get
            progressively integrated, widened and deepened with economic
            and financial evolution,. How this comes about is the
            question discussed in this paper. The crucial variable in
            this context seems to be transaction costs (both
            administrative costs and default risk). Financial
            innovations reduce these costs and thus lower the costs of
            lending and borrowing (not completely represented by the
            interest rate) and narrow the interest rate differentials.
            This has saving, investment, output and distribution
            effects. Such is the broad theme of this paper. The second
            paper - Some Theory Concerning the Role and Failings of
            Financial Intermediation - develops an analytic frame
            centered around the impact of transaction costs and
            identifies the type of policy interventions that may
            increase rather than reduce the degree of imperfections in
            the capital market.
