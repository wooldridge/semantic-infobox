This report is based on fieldwork and research funded by the Water and&#13;
Sanitation Program (WSP) in India, Indonesia, and Tanzania. The fieldwork and&#13;
research could not have taken place without the support and assistance of the&#13;
Government of Himachal Pradesh (Rural Development Department, Irrigation&#13;
and Public Health Department), the Government of Madhya Pradesh (Panchayat&#13;
and Rural Development Department, Public Health Engineering Department), the&#13;
Government of India; the Provincial Government of East Java, the Government of&#13;
Indonesia; the Government of Tanzania; and Water and Sanitation Program staff&#13;
based in East Asia and the Pacific, South Asia, and Africa.&#13;

management and coordination of the work.&#13;
Designated a core business area in 2011, WSPâ&#128;&#153;s Scaling Up Rural Sanitation&#13;
is working with governments and the local private sector to develop the&#13;
knowledge needed to scale up rural sanitation for the poor. The programmatic&#13;
approach combines Community-Led Total Sanitation (CLTS), behavior change&#13;
communication, and sanitation marketing to generate sanitation demand and&#13;
build up the supply of sanitation products and services at scale. In addition,&#13;
WSP works with local and national governments and the local private sector&#13;
to strengthen the enabling environmentâ&#128;&#148;including institutional, regulatory,&#13;
financial, service delivery, and monitoring capacitiesâ&#128;&#148;to achieve change that is&#13;
sustainable. Starting in India, Indonesia, and Tanzania in 2006, Scaling Up Rural&#13;
Sanitation is currently being implemented in more than a dozen countries. For&#13;

Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢ A functioning national M&amp;E system will likely be beyond the grasp of most&#13;
      countries in the near future. This should be a high priority for governments&#13;
      and all development partners to work on together. A more practical short-&#13;
      term approach might be an M&amp;E strategy that uses ad hoc household sur-&#13;
      veys, district-level monitoring systems, evaluations, and annual reviews. This&#13;
      is by no means ideal, but perhaps realistic.&#13;
&#13;
Recommendations&#13;
Sequencing of Enabling Environment Interventions&#13;
Experience and evidence from the three-year period between baseline and endline as-&#13;
sessments indicates a logical sequencing of interventions when introducing the total&#13;
sanitation and sanitation marketing approach in a country. The first phase includes&#13;
developing country-specific models including the research required to inform these&#13;
models and practical and workable M&amp;E systems; building an evidence base and local&#13;
political commitment that can be used to influence regional and central decision-&#13;
makers to adopt the program approaches more widely; initiating supply chain devel-&#13;
opment; and improving policy, strategy, and direction accordingly. A second phase&#13;
would start once the local models have convinced central decision makers and other&#13;
stakeholders to improve policy, strategy, and direction, and an effective national M&amp;E&#13;
system is being established. At this point, the other dimensionsâ&#128;&#148;finance to support&#13;
the national strategic plan, institutional arrangements to encourage leadership and co-&#13;
ordination, capacity development plans to fill gaps and strengthen weaknesses, and&#13;
supply chain development and supportâ&#128;&#148;become important.&#13;
Role of WSP and Other Development Partners&#13;
In Indonesia and Tanzania especially, WSP played a lead role in supporting govern-&#13;
ment efforts. Ideally, a scaling up rural sanitation program should be managed by the&#13;
lead government agency responsible for rural sanitation from the outset. However, this&#13;
is not a realistic goal in many countries in the early stages because lead agencies often&#13;
lack the management and organizational capacity to manage a large-scale effort, in-&#13;
cluding the financial management and procurement systems needed for efficient pro-&#13;
gram implementation. In effect, the degree of support from WSP or another external&#13;
agency can be viewed on a continuum and must be situation specific. The goal is for&#13;
the lead government agency to manage the overall effort. In countries where the lead&#13;
agency lacks staff capacity, systems, and resources, a focused effort should be made to&#13;
develop this capacity, with WSP or other development partners transitioning to an&#13;
advisory and coaching role. This process is now happening in India, Indonesia, and&#13;
Tanzania where WSPâ&#128;&#153;s role has evolved as needed and appropriate.&#13;

&amp;#12;&amp;#12;I.             Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP) has provided technical assistance to&#13;
support government efforts to scale up rural sanitation since 2007 through Scal-&#13;
ing Up Rural Sanitation (TSSM). One of the central objectives of this initiative&#13;
is to learn how to improve rural sanitation at a scale sufficient to meet the 2015&#13;
Millennium Development Goal for sanitation in Indonesia, Tanzania, and the&#13;
states of Himachal Pradesh (HP) and Madhya Pradesh (MP) in India, and to&#13;
then use the lessons learned to help replicate policy, programmatic, and service&#13;
delivery approaches in other countries.&#13;
&#13;
Endline assessments of the programmatic and institutional conditions (referred to&#13;
by the project as the enabling environment) needed to scale up, sustain, and repli-&#13;
cate the total sanitation and sanitation marketing approaches were conducted in all&#13;
three countries: East Java province in Indonesia; ten districts in Tanzania; and Him-&#13;
achal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Separate endline assessment reports have been&#13;
completed on improvements in the enabling environment in all three countries.&#13;
&#13;
Baseline assessments of the enabling environment were conducted in late 2007&#13;
during the start-up phase of the overall project. The baseline assessments identi-&#13;
fied weaknesses in the enabling environment in each country and made concrete&#13;
recommendations for WSP technical support to help address these gaps. These&#13;
recommendations were incorporated into WSP work plans in each of the coun-&#13;
tries. Although WSP facilitated the implementation of these recommendations,&#13;
the process involved broad stakeholder involvement with the government and&#13;
development partners involved in rural sanitation.&#13;
&#13;
Enabling environment endline assessments were carried out three years later, be-&#13;
tween July and November 2010, following a one-year extension of the project&#13;
from its original end date.&#13;
&#13;
The purpose of the endline country assessments was to:&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Assess the extent to which the enabling environment for scale up and sus-&#13;
      tainability improved by 2010;&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Recommend what should be done to address any gaps identified by the&#13;
      assessment during the remainder of the project implementation period, or&#13;
      in the future if a follow-on project is undertaken; and&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Determine whether an appropriate enabling environment is in place to&#13;
      meet the 2015 MDG sanitation target, and assess whether these condi-&#13;
      tions are likely to be sustained.&#13;
The fundamental determination that the endline assessment should clarify is if the&#13;
enabling environment in each country has been institutionalized to support scal-&#13;
ing up in a sustainable manner, and whether that scale up can continue after 2010:&#13;
without assistance, with less assistance, or with different assistance from the project.&#13;
&#13;
The purpose of this report is to synthesize the key findings, conclusions, and rec-&#13;
ommendations from these three assessments to provide guidance and insight for&#13;
other countries seeking to create large-scale sustainable rural sanitation programs.&#13;

2.1.7 Cost-Effective Implementation&#13;
While it will not be possible to assess the cost-effectiveness of the approach or&#13;
how best to achieve economies of scale and scope until the end of the project,&#13;
data must still be collected during implementation. Therefore, the focus in this&#13;
assessment category is to ensure that systems and procedures for collecting cost&#13;
information exist.&#13;
&#13;
2.1.8 Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Large-scale sanitation programs require regular monitoring and periodic evalua-&#13;
tion and, perhaps more importantly, the willingness and ability to use the moni-&#13;
toring process to make adjustments in the program. Effective monitoring will&#13;
identify strengths and weaknesses in the program methodology, implementation&#13;
arrangements, and cost efficiencies. Overall monitoring responsibility must be at&#13;
the highest level of the program, but must be based on information collected at&#13;
the local government or community level.&#13;

Definition of Scale-up: Increase the scale, rate of provision, and sustainability of&#13;
sanitation services to reach the project targets and help countries reach MDG&#13;
targets for sanitation by 2015 (see Table 1).&#13;
&#13;
The country assessments were carried out over a three-week in-country visit by&#13;
a single consultant. The assessment methodology consisted of a review of docu-&#13;
ments, interviews with key informants, and field visits for reality testing. Terms&#13;
of Reference for carrying out an enabling environment endline assessment are&#13;

     in the level of political commitment and involvement, the                                        data greatly limited the ability of managers and decision-&#13;

     Large-scale implementation is also dependent on effective                                        agency. Political will is of overriding importance since it is a&#13;
     institutional arrangements. In Tanzania, the lack of a well-                                     precondition for resource allocation and accountability. Yet&#13;
     resourced and effective lead agency proved to be an inhibit-                                     despite the benefits of advocacy efforts, political will is not&#13;
     ing factor to scale up. While all countries have established                                     something that can be turned on easily because of the com-&#13;

      or periodic household surveys, rapid assessments, evaluations, and annual&#13;
      reviews. This is by no means an abandonment of the goal of developing&#13;
      robust M&amp;E systems, but rather a recognition of the difficulty of devel-&#13;
      oping these in most countries. A case in point is national health infor-&#13;
      mation systems, which in most countries are typically weak and produce&#13;
      unreliable information. Developing these systems is a long-term and com-&#13;
      plicated endeavor, suggesting that adopting more modest goals may be a&#13;
      better strategy in the short and medium term.&#13;
    â&#128;¢ Develop guidelines for the horizontal learning approach where countries,&#13;
      states, and districts can learn from one another. There is widespread agree-&#13;
      ment on the utility of horizontal learning, but not very much exists on&#13;
      exactly how to do it effectively. A guidance document would greatly facili-&#13;
      tate the wider use of horizontal learning.&#13;

6.4 Emerging Learning Questions&#13;
for the Enabling Environment&#13;
Experience in strengthening the enabling environment between 2007 and 2010&#13;
has led to significant learning, much of which this report has tried to capture.&#13;
However, there are important learning questions that are not yet answered.&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢ How can political commitment for rural sanitation be developed? What&#13;
      techniques have been successfully used? What generic lessons can be drawn&#13;
      from the success and failures?&#13;
    â&#128;¢ What would be a successful approach to developing the capacity of an&#13;
      agency to lead a large-scale rural sanitation effort? What are the charac-&#13;
      teristics a lead agency needs to have, e.g., core competencies, institutional&#13;
      profile, mandate, resources, and effective leadership?&#13;
    â&#128;¢ What is the appropriate sequence of interventions for a specific country&#13;
      while planning to scale up a national rural sanitation activity?&#13;
    â&#128;¢ How can a sustainable capacity-development system be established to sup-&#13;
      port total sanitation and sanitation marketing?&#13;
    â&#128;¢ What are the elements of a successful sanitation marketing component&#13;
      using a business aggregator model? How can successful sanitation entre-&#13;
      preneurs be identified?&#13;
    â&#128;¢ If funds and capacity for contracting and managing market research are&#13;
      not available, what alternative approaches can be adopted for understand-&#13;
      ing local sanitation markets and facilitating local business development?&#13;
    â&#128;¢ What alternative monitoring and evaluation systems can be developed&#13;
      that are not overly ambitious for some countries? What conditions need to&#13;
      be in place before considering the development and operationalization of&#13;
      national M&amp;E systems for rural sanitation programs?&#13;

&amp;#12;     VII.                      Epilogue&#13;
&#13;
     Research for the endline assessment was conducted between July and November&#13;
     2010 and the findings therefore reflect milestones up to that point. Since the&#13;
     endline assessment was carried out, local and national governments have contin-&#13;
     ued to strengthen the enabling environments for their at-scale rural sanitation&#13;
     initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
     In India, between November 2010 and March 2012, there were several notable&#13;
     developments at the national level. First, the incentives for Below Poverty Line&#13;
     (BPL) households were increased to reflect rising costs for basic sanitation fa-&#13;
     cilities. In Madhya Pradesh, the state government approved an individual per-&#13;
     formance award program to award district and block coordinators who created&#13;
     eight village resource centers in the Gram Panchayats with the best NGPs. These&#13;
     will be used as learning and training centers for the TSC program. The state also&#13;
     undertook a thorough internal verification of proposed NGP applicants before&#13;
     forwarding applications to national government, and operationalized a new state&#13;
     reward, the Ujjwal Award, that requires 100 percent sustainability of open def-&#13;
     ecation free status. In Himachal Pradesh, the enabling environment continued to&#13;
     be strong for rural sanitation and no new actions were initiated.&#13;
&#13;
     In Indonesia, between November 2011 and March 2012, the national govern-&#13;
     ment launched a national program across six regions modeled after the East Java&#13;
     experience. To support scaled-up implementation, the Ministry of Health de-&#13;
     veloped operational guidelines and drafted a strategy to help local governments&#13;
     build the necessary capacity. Four provinces have adopted the strategy. Increased&#13;
     scale-up is being supported by a newly revived STBM Secretariat that has taken&#13;
     steps to improve outreach and knowledge sharing. The Secretariat is supported by&#13;
     a pool of experts, the website has been worked on and improvedâ&#128;&#148;for example,&#13;
     a new feature of the website is a web-based monitoring systemâ&#128;&#148;and the first&#13;
     electronic newsletter was sent to local government officials.&#13;
&#13;
     In Tanzania, between November 2011 and March 2012, a national total sanita-&#13;
     tion campaign was launched based on the experience in the ten districts. The&#13;
     Asian Development Bank disbursed funding for the national campaign and ori-&#13;
     entation for participating zones and regions is underway. The national govern-&#13;
     ment also developed national program targets, indicators, an implementation&#13;
     manual, and guidance materials. At the district level, districts participated in a&#13;
     supply-strengthening exercise that included hardware suppliers.&#13;

            The Water and Sanitation Program (WSP)
            has provided technical assistance to support government
            efforts to scale up rural sanitation since 2007 through
            Scaling up Rural Sanitation (TSSM). One of the central
            objectives of this initiative is to learn how to improve
            rural sanitation at a scale sufficient to meet the 2015
            millennium development goal for sanitation in Indonesia,
            Tanzania, and the states of Himachal Pradesh (HP) and Madhya
            Pradesh (MP) in India, and to then use the lessons learned
            to help replicate policy, programmatic, and service delivery
            approaches in other countries. Endline assessments of the
            programmatic and institutional conditions (referred to by
            the project as the enabling environment) needed to scale up,
            sustain, and replicate the total sanitation and sanitation
            marketing approaches were conducted in all three countries:
            East Java province in Indonesia; ten districts in Tanzania;
            and Himachal Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh. Baseline
            assessments of the enabling environment were conducted in
            late 2007 during the start-up phase of the overall project.
            The baseline assessments identified weaknesses in the
            enabling environment in each country and made concrete
            recommendations for WSP technical support to help address
            these gaps. These recommendations were incorporated into WSP
            work plans in each of the countries. The purpose of this
            report is to synthesize the key findings, conclusions, and
            recommendations from these three assessments to provide
            guidance and insight for other countries seeking to create
            large-scale sustainable rural sanitation programs.
