This study investigates the performance of private pensions systems across countries â&#128;&#147; a topic&#13;
which has yet to be adequately addressed in the literature. Specifically, this study examines the&#13;
relationship between pension fund performance (as captured by gross real rates of return and&#13;
the three year standard deviation of those returns) and the structure of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s private&#13;
pension industry and the design of its pension schemes. A database covering 27 countries over&#13;
the period 1990-2007 was created for this research. The studyâ&#128;&#153;s key findings include (i) higher&#13;
returns are associated with size (systems with more assets under management tend to&#13;
generate higher returns), type (occupational schemes tend to generate higher returns than do&#13;
personal pension schemes and closed schemes tend to generate higher returns than do open&#13;
schemes), and number (systems with multiple funds tend to generate higher returns than those&#13;
with a single fund) and (ii) lower volatility in pension system returns is associated with older&#13;
systems, voluntary (rather than mandatory) systems, systems with restrictions on foreign&#13;
investing, and systems with minimum return guarantees.&#13;
&#13;
                                                   RESUMEN&#13;
Este documento provee evidencia sobre el desempeÃ±o de los sistemas privados de pensiÃ³n, en&#13;
base a la comparaciÃ³n de los mismos entre 27 paÃ­ses. En particular, se examina si existe una&#13;
relaciÃ³n entre dos medidas de desempeÃ±o (retorno y varianza), y las caracterÃ­sticas de la&#13;
estructura de la industria y del diseÃ±o de los planes de pensiones. Se utiliza una base de datos&#13;
de panel, compilada para esta investigaciÃ³n, que cubre el perÃ­odo 1990-2007. El estudio usa&#13;
como fundamentos la literatura existente sobre fondos de pensiones privados y la teorÃ­a de&#13;
finanzas para establecer un marco metodolÃ³gico para el subsiguiente trabajo economÃ©trico.&#13;
Encontramos que sistemas con mayor tamaÃ±o, ocupacionales (en oposiciÃ³n a los personales),&#13;
cerrados (en oposiciÃ³n a los abiertos) y multifondos (en oposiciÃ³n a los de fondos Ãºnicos)&#13;
muestran, en promedio, niveles superiores de retornos. Los sistemas con mayor edad,&#13;
voluntarios (en oposiciÃ³n a los obligatorios), con lÃ­mites a las inversiones en el exterior, y con&#13;
garantÃ­as mÃ­nimas se encuentran, en promedio, relacionados con menor volatilidad en los&#13;
retornos del sistema.&#13;

&amp;#12;I.      INTRODUCTION&#13;
Privately managed pension funds have been growing in importance in an increasing number of&#13;
countries, both in the developed and developing world. According to data assembled by the&#13;
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) and the World Bank covering&#13;
the period 1990 to 2007, the financial assets of privately managed pension funds expressed as a&#13;
percentage of GDP increased, on average, from 40% to 62% for developed countries and from&#13;
2% to 14% for developing countries between the first and last years of observations available. 2&#13;
&#13;
Surprisingly little is known about the comparative performance of private pension fund&#13;
investments across countries. This study draws on both the existing literature and on financial&#13;
theory and then examines the observed relationship between two measures of investment&#13;
performance â&#128;&#147; the real gross rates of return earned on a countryâ&#128;&#153;s pension system investments&#13;
and the volatility of those returns as measured by their three year standard deviation â&#128;&#147; and (i)&#13;
the key design attributes of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s pension system and (ii) the characteristics of the&#13;
countryâ&#128;&#153;s pension fund industry while controlling for cross-country differences in key&#13;
macroeconomic, financial sector, and institutional variables.&#13;
&#13;
Key design attributes include whether (i) the system is mandatory or voluntary, (ii) schemes are&#13;
sponsored by employers (i.e., occupational funds) or marketed directly to individuals, (iii)&#13;
benefits are determined using a defined benefit (DB) or a defined contribution (DC)&#13;
methodology, (iv) schemes are open versus closed, (v) a minimum return guarantee exists, (vi)&#13;
management fees are based on the value of assets managed or on the flow of new&#13;
contributions, (vii) supervision is risk-based or governed by a prudent person standard, (viii)&#13;
there exist multiple funds or only one, and (ix) quantitative limits are established to limit&#13;
foreign investments. Macroeconomic, financial market, and institutional variables are used as&#13;
controls. The most important characteristics that define the structure of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s pension&#13;
industry include (i) the age of the pension system, (ii) the value of assets under management,&#13;
(iii) the number of pension funds in operation, and (iv) the degree to which the market is&#13;
dominated by a few large funds.&#13;
&#13;
For pension fund participants, investment returns directly influence the premiums they pay for&#13;
a given level of benefits or the level of benefits they receive for a given stream of contributions.&#13;
Previous studies have either been industry-specific, fund-specific, or have been limited to a&#13;
particular country. Most have aimed to identify to identify issues related to industry structure&#13;
or system design or to improve the ability of trustees to select capable investment managers.&#13;
This study is based on panel data (i.e., the aggregation of pension fund portfolios at the&#13;
national level) rather than on data for any given pension fund or collection of funds. Its purpose&#13;
is more ambitious: this study aims to identify policy issues â&#128;&#147; including issues related to the&#13;
&#13;
2&#13;
  Throughout this study, developed countries refers to the countries of the OECD while developing countries&#13;
include Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, the Dominican Republic, El&#13;
Salvador, Estonia, India, Indonesia, Israel, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Lithuania, Mauritius, Peru, the Russian&#13;
Federation, Serbia, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, Thailand, Uruguay, and Zambia. The first and last years of&#13;
observations vary by country due to the availability of data (see Tables 11 and 12 in Appendix 1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         5&#13;
&amp;#12;macroeconomy, financial sector, institutional and industrial structure of the pension system,&#13;
and pension system design â&#128;&#147; that can be changed by policy makers in order to improve the&#13;
investment climate or improve investment performance on the part of pension schemes within&#13;
the national pension system.&#13;
&#13;
The remainder of this study is organized as follows. Section II discusses the methodology&#13;
employed. Section III provides descriptive statistics and summarizes the econometric results.&#13;
Section IV provides conclusions, discusses the limits of the study, and offers suggestions for&#13;
further research. Appendix 1 provides detailed econometric output. Appendix 2 provides a list&#13;
of references employed by this study. Appendix 3 summarizes the prior research consulted&#13;
during the preparation of this study.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
II.        METHODOLOGY&#13;
This section explains the methodology used to measure pension system investment&#13;
performance and is divided into four subsections covering the data used for the study, the two&#13;
dependent variables (gross real rates of return and the volatility of those returns), the&#13;
explanatory variables, and various econometric issues.&#13;
&#13;
Sample&#13;
&#13;
This study relies on a database created using annual observations for 26 countries including&#13;
Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Croatia, Czech Republic,&#13;
Denmark, El Salvador, Estonia, Hungary, Israel, Japan, Kazakhstan, Latvia, Mexico, Netherlands,&#13;
Peru, Poland, Sweden, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States, and Uruguay, as well as for&#13;
the special administrative region of Hong Kong. The data generally covers the period from 1990&#13;
to 2007 although its availability varies by country. 3&#13;
&#13;
Dependent Variables&#13;
&#13;
Decisions by pension portfolio managers â&#128;&#147; and, thus, patterns of pension fund returns â&#128;&#147; are&#13;
influenced by several factors including the set of available investment opportunities, regulatory&#13;
constraints, preferences regarding risk, and the time horizon of investment decisions. Given&#13;
these situation-specific factors, defining â&#128;&#156;successâ&#128;? is methodologically problematic. This makes&#13;
it difficult to establish uniform criteria for comparing the performance of pension funds across&#13;
countries. Nevertheless, by taking a simplified approach, this study attempts to do just that. In&#13;
this study, pension fund performance is defined solely by rates of return on invested assets and&#13;
the volatility of those returns. The authors recognize the limits of such an approach but believe&#13;
those limits are outweighed by the usefulness of the approach in providing insight into pension&#13;
fund performance as a function of the structure of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s pension fund industry and the&#13;
design of its pension system.&#13;
&#13;

                                               6&#13;
&amp;#12;    â&#128;¢    Gross Real Return: this study measures investment returns using gross real pension&#13;
         system returns based on annual data from the OECD, the Association of Latin American&#13;
         Pension Supervisors (AIOS), and FederaciÃ³n Internacional de Administradoras de Fondos&#13;
         de Pensiones (FIAP). In cases where national pension systems include more than one&#13;
         fund, the returns have been weighted according to the relative size of each fund in the&#13;
         system. For the purposes of cross-country comparison, returns are measured in real&#13;
         terms (e.g., nominal rates of gross returns are adjusted for inflation). 4&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢    Volatility of Gross Real Return: this study measures investment risk using a three year&#13;
         standard deviations of gross real pension system return based on annual data. This&#13;
         measure of risk was chosen for simplicity and for reasons of data availability. Such a&#13;
         measure is clearly limited in scope as it does not capture other sources of risk often&#13;
         present in emerging markets such as exchange rate-related risks, jurisdictional risks, and&#13;
         default risks. Using a more robust measure of risk represents a fruitful opportunity for&#13;
         further study. Such a measure also does not comport with a typical investment horizon&#13;
         because pension funds are generally long term investors. However, extending this&#13;
         period would have resulted in lost observations in the data, thereby reducing the&#13;
         statistical confidence of the findings and limiting the range of the sample.&#13;
&#13;
Explanatory Variables&#13;
&#13;
The database also includes annual observations for the explanatory variables which are&#13;
grouped into four categories including (i) pension system variables, (ii) macroeconomic&#13;
variables, (iii) financial sector variables, and (iv) institutional variables. A summary of these&#13;
variables, their definitions, and their sources is contained in Table 6 in Appendix 1.&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢    Pension System Variables include both descriptive time-series variables relating to&#13;
         market structure and dummy variables that capture the major characteristics of a&#13;
         pension systemâ&#128;&#153;s design.&#13;
&#13;
             o Market Structure Variables include (i) the number of years a pension system has&#13;
               been in existence (years since inception), (ii) the total value of assets under&#13;
               management expressed relative to GDP (assets under management), (iii) the&#13;
               number of pension funds in the pension system (number of funds), and (iv) the&#13;
               market share of the largest three funds as a measure of market concentration&#13;
               (market concentration).&#13;
&#13;
             o System Design Variables are specified as dummy variables (i.e.,. their values are&#13;
               either 0 or 1) and capture (i) whether a pension system is mandatory or&#13;
               voluntary (mandatory vs. voluntary), (ii) whether a pension system is based on&#13;
               occupational or individual schemes (occupational vs. personal), (iii) whether&#13;
               benefits are determined using a DC or DB benefit structure (DC vs. DB), (iv)&#13;
&#13;
4&#13;
 Since no data was available to calculate net rates of return (i.e., returns net of administrative costs), the ratio of&#13;
gross returns to net returns could not be used as another measure of pension fund performance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          7&#13;
&amp;#12;                  whether a system is open to everyone (for the purpose of this study, this is&#13;
                  interpreted to mean that at least one pension fund exists which has no&#13;
                  restrictions on membership) or only to select persons or employees (open vs.&#13;
                  closed), (v) whether a pension system offers a minimum rate of return or benefit&#13;
                  guarantee (minimum guarantee), (vi) whether fees are levied based on the&#13;
                  amount of annual contributions or on the assets under management&#13;
                  (contribution-based vs. asset-based), (vii) whether supervision is risk-based or&#13;
                  based on a prudent person standard (risk-based supervision), and (viii) whether a&#13;
                  pension system has multiple funds or a single fund (multiple funds). In addition,&#13;
                  the impact of restrictions on portfolio composition is examined using a foreign&#13;
                  investments limit variable (foreign investment limit) with values ranging in&#13;
                  percentages from zero (i.e., a complete prohibition on foreign investing) to 100&#13;
                  (i.e., no restrictions).&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢    Macroeconomic Variables include the (i) real rate of GDP growth (real GDP growth), (ii)&#13;
         per capita GDP expressed on purchasing power parity basis (per capita GDP), (iii) the&#13;
         rate of inflation (inflation), (iv) the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s fiscal surplus or deficit expressed as a&#13;
         percent of GDP (fiscal surplus), (v) the annual percent change in the exchange rate&#13;
         (exchange rate growth), 5 (vi) the real annual rate of interest for deposits of up to 90&#13;
         days (real interest rate), and (vii) a measure of the openness of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s capital&#13;
         account (capital account openness). 6&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢    Financial Sector Variables include the (i) the capitalization of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s stock market&#13;
         expressed relative to its GDP (stock market capitalization), (ii) the capitalization of a&#13;
         countryâ&#128;&#153;s corporate bond market expressed relative to its GDP (corporate bond market&#13;
         capitalization), (iii) the stock of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s debt expressed relative to its GDP (stock of&#13;
         public debt), and (iv) the amount of credit extended to a countryâ&#128;&#153;s private sector relative&#13;
         to its GDP (credit to private sector).&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢    Institutional Variables include three indices. The first is the rule of law index, extracted&#13;
         from Kaufmann, Kraay, and Mastruzzi (2008), which measures confidence in the rules of&#13;
         society (to include contract enforcement, property rights, the police and courts, as well&#13;
         as the incidence of crime and violence). The second is the anti self-dealing index,&#13;
         extracted from Djankov, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2005) which measures&#13;
         the strength with which minority shareholders are protected against self dealing by&#13;
         controlling shareholders. The third is the creditor rights index, extracted from Djankov,&#13;
         McLiesh, and Shleifer (2007) which measures the legal rights of creditors to recover&#13;
         losses against defaulting debtors in different jurisdictions.&#13;

  Exchange rates are defined as a countryâ&#128;&#153;s national currency against the United States dollar ($US). Thus, for $US-&#13;
based economies (i.e., the United States and El Salvador), the exchange rate variable will be equal to 1.0 for all&#13;
years. Although, the authors recognize the merits of using use multilateral (i.e., weighted) exchange rates, they&#13;
were not used to avoid excessive complication.&#13;

  Capital account openness is defined as the sum of the absolute value of Portfolio Investment Assets (IFS line&#13;
78bfd) plus Portfolio Investment Liabilities (IFS line 78bgd) divided by GDP. All variables are defined in Appendix 1.&#13;

&amp;#12;As discussed in the review of the literature, other characteristics merit consideration and&#13;
evaluation, but insufficient data was available to generate robust statistical results for these&#13;
characteristics so they are not addressed herein.&#13;
&#13;
Econometric Approach&#13;
&#13;
The relationship between performance measures (i.e., gross real return and the volatility of&#13;
gross real return) and explanatory variables is examined using the specifications shown in the&#13;
two equations below. Each block of explanatory variables is sequentially incorporated. For use&#13;
with the second equation, macroeconomic and financial sector variables are transformed into&#13;
their respective three year standard deviations. This required the authors to first test the&#13;
volatility of these variables as determinants.&#13;

Where k1, k2, k3 and k4 stand for the number of the macroeconomic, financial system,&#13;
institutional, and pension industry variables, respectively. The error term                 ) is&#13;
separated into a country-specific component and a remaining error (                +     ). The&#13;
country-specific component is modeled as a random term. 7 The objective of this specification is&#13;
to eliminate bias in the estimation due to (i) unobserved components (and also to â&#128;&#156;non&#13;
observable effectsâ&#128;? and â&#128;&#156;non observable heterogeneityâ&#128;?) and (ii) country-specific&#13;
characteristics impacting performance that are not captured by the explanatory variables. This&#13;
methodological approach also reduces problems related to errors in the measurement of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7&#13;
  A fixed-effects model could not be used for the purpose of testing pension system design variables (which are&#13;
almost constant over time) because the estimation would not enable the effects of policy variables from other&#13;
country-level constant effects.&#13;

assumptions.9&#13;

III.    RESULTS&#13;
Performance Measures&#13;
&#13;
Table 7 in Appendix 1 provides the main statistics for gross real return, and for volatility of gross&#13;
real return. Figures reflect all available (country and period) observations. The mean of the&#13;
gross real return is 6.4%. The mean of the volatility of gross real return is 5.8%; its median is a&#13;
bit lower at 4.2% which may reflect the existence of abnormally high observations, possible&#13;
outliers in the underlying distribution. In fact, the country that displays the highest volatility of&#13;
gross real return is Argentina as a consequence of the crises the country experienced between&#13;
2001 and 2002,which caused gross real returns to plummet to -45.2% in 2002.&#13;
&#13;
Table 8 in Appendix 1 reports the same statistics by country. The countries with the highest&#13;
mean gross real return are Uruguay (14.7%), Colombia (10.4%), Peru (10.9%), and Australia&#13;
(9.4%). The countries with the lowest mean gross real return are Denmark (2.2%), the Czech&#13;
Republic (1.1%), Hungary (0.9%), and Latvia (-1.8%). The countries with the highest volatility of&#13;
gross real return are Argentina (17.2%), Kazakhstan (12.7%), United Kingdom (12.2%) and&#13;
Uruguay (12.1%) while the lowest are Canada (3.2%), Croatia (2.7%), Czech Republic (1.6%), and&#13;
Denmark (1.1%).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
8&#13;
  One of the key assumptions underlying this specification is that shocks to pension returns (and also to the&#13;
volatility of those returns) that are not already explained by the explanatory variables â&#128;&#147; or by unobserved&#13;
heterogeneity â&#128;&#147; are uncorrelated with present or future changes in the explanatory variables (i.e., an assumption&#13;
of strict exogeneity). This assumption may prove unfounded if unexpected shocks (i.e., shocks not captured by an&#13;
explanatory variable) drive changes in pension system design. An additional assumption is that the unobserved&#13;
heterogeneity component is not correlated with any of the explanatory variables (i.e., a random effects modeling&#13;
assumption).&#13;
9&#13;
  Tables 35 and 36 in Appendix 1 provide the results for two specification tests. Table 35 shows the Breusch &amp;&#13;
Pagan (1980) statistic which tests for the presence of unobserved heterogeneity. For the pension system return&#13;
model, and assuming no unobserved heterogeneity, the null hypothesis cannot be rejected when incorporating all&#13;
of the blocks of control variables. This suggest that the control variables account for much of the heterogeneity&#13;
between countries. Note how the progressive incorporation of controls implies the impossibility of rejecting the&#13;
null. This suggests that the incorporation of these variables properly captures the heterogeneity between&#13;
countries. In the case of the pension system return model, this implies that a pooled ordinary least squares model&#13;
specification would also report efficient estimators. In fact, when incorporating control variable blocks, the results&#13;
of ordinary least squares and random effects estimations are nearly identical since the estimated unobserved&#13;
variability is close to zero. However, in the case of the pension system return volatility model, the nulls are&#13;
rejected at a 5% confidence threshold. This prevents us from assuming a lack of unobserved heterogeneity and&#13;
requires us to explicitly model it. Table 36 shows the results of Hausman (1978) tests in order to check for the lack&#13;
of correlation between the unobserved heterogeneity component and the explanatory variables. (In actual&#13;
practice, if correlation were found, it would not be possible, of course, to rely on an alternative specification.) We&#13;
did not run the Hausman test for those specifications where all control blocks were incorporated because, as&#13;
previously explained, no significant presence of unobserved heterogeneity was found. Finally, no autocorrelation&#13;
or heteroscedasticity were found by any related residuals tests although the results are not shown.&#13;

&amp;#12;Cross-Country Mean and Volatility&#13;
&#13;
Figure 1 shows the relationship between mean gross real return (y-axis) and the volatility of&#13;
gross real return (x-axis), as measured by the three year standard deviation of the gross real&#13;
return for all countries in the sample. Clearly, the observation for Argentina should be&#13;
considered as an outlier, exhibiting excessive volatility relative to its mean real rate of return.&#13;
The general pattern of observations seems to suggest that, as one might expect, risk and return&#13;
exhibit positive correlation.&#13;

  Note: whole sample, 1990-2007, using data for which each country reports its available period&#13;
  statistic.&#13;
&#13;
In order to check the consistency of these cross-country patterns over time, Figures 4 to 6 in&#13;
Appendix 1 shown the same data disaggregated into three time periods (1990 to 1995, 1996 to&#13;
2001, and 2002 to 2007). To avoid differences in mean returns due to economic cycles, only&#13;
countries with complete data for the full periods have been included. While it may not be&#13;
apparent in some periods (particularly the period 1996 to 2001), a positive pattern does appear&#13;
in all of the graphs.&#13;
&#13;
Correlations&#13;
&#13;
The question of whether performance measures are correlated among pensions systems over&#13;
time â&#128;&#147; an outcome which would seem reasonable given economic integration and globalization&#13;
â&#128;&#147; is examined next. Pairwise correlations of gross real returns are shown in Table 9 in Appendix&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

countries in the sample). Table 1 below summarizes these results.&#13;

&#13;
Forty two percent of the correlations coefficients are found to be higher than 0.5 which&#13;
suggests that the presence of correlation between cross-country pension returns over time is&#13;
important.&#13;
&#13;
Econometric Results&#13;
&#13;
This subsection summarizes the results of the estimations generated by the two investment&#13;
performance models with the primary objective of identifying differences in performance that&#13;
are related to the pension fund characteristics. As was explained in Section II, the models&#13;
correspond to the two dependent variables used herein to capture pension system&#13;
performance (i.e., gross real return and the volatility of gross real return). Tables 2, 3, and 4&#13;
provide a summary of the results. For each model, alternative specifications were run that&#13;
sequentially incorporate the selected blocks of control variables (i.e., macroeconomic variables,&#13;
financial sector variables, institutional variables, and pension system variables). 10 The results&#13;
are presented below, starting first with pension system variables followed by control variables.&#13;
&#13;
Pension System Variables&#13;
&#13;
Market Structure Variables&#13;
&#13;
Key findings include the following: bigger systems (in terms of assets under management and&#13;
the number of funds operating) exhibit higher levels of gross real returns; older systems exhibit&#13;
lower levels of volatility in their returns. An interesting question is whether the impact of&#13;
system size on returns is the result of lower transactions costs due to economies of scale, riskier&#13;
investment strategies, greater financial innovation (possibly engendered by the existence of a&#13;
large private pension industry), more efficient investment opportunities, or some combination&#13;
of these factors. The following observations might provide an answer. There is a positive&#13;
relationship between assets under management and the volatility of gross real return which&#13;
suggests that higher returns in bigger systems may be the consequence of riskier investment&#13;
strategies. Volatility may also be related to the degree of market concentration in the pension&#13;
industry and the resulting level of competition. Our results suggest that an increase in market&#13;

  Full econometric results tables are not provided to save space but can be found in Appendix 1. When creating&#13;
summary tables, results are not reports for model specifications that yielded too few observations or that did not&#13;
pass specification tests. The problem of too few observations prevented us from analyzing models incorporating&#13;
multiple funds, numbers of pension funds, and market concentration variables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       12&#13;
&amp;#12;concentration (as measured by the market share of the three largest funds) is positively&#13;
correlated with an increase in the volatility of pension system returns.&#13;
&#13;
Pension System Age: years since inception displays no relationship with gross real return but is&#13;
negatively related to volatility of gross real return. The estimated coefficient suggests that a one&#13;
year increase in years since inception is associated with a decrease in volatility of gross real&#13;
return of about 0.05 points. This could suggest that pension fund managers in older systems&#13;
have learned from their experience or the regulatory system has been strengthened over time.&#13;

                                                              incorporating institutional controls.&#13;
Note: macroeconomic and financial system variables were transformed to their respective three year standard&#13;
deviations when used with estimations for the volatility of pension returns. For methodological details see Section&#13;
II.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Industry Size: assets under management exhibits a positive relationship with gross real return. A&#13;
ten percentage point increase in the value of assets under management is associated with an&#13;
increase of 0.8 to 1.3 percentage points in gross real return. As discussed previously, this&#13;
measure of industry size is also positively related to volatility of gross real return.&#13;
&#13;
Number of Funds: another proxy for market size (but perhaps more related to the level of&#13;
competition in the market) is number of funds which is positively associated with gross real&#13;
return. Each additional fund is associated with an increase of 0.06 to 0.07 percentage points in&#13;
gross real return. This might suggest that an increase in the size of â&#128;&#147; and the amount of&#13;
competition in â&#128;&#147; the pension industry is associated with improved efficiency of the allocation of&#13;
capital, thereby increasing rates of return.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        13&#13;
&amp;#12;Market Concentration: the degree of market concentration is positively associated with an&#13;
increase in volatility of gross real return although no relationship was found with the returns&#13;
themselves. A 10% increase in the market share of the three largest pension funds is associated&#13;
with an increase of 1 to 2 percentage points in the three year standard deviation of pension&#13;
system returns.&#13;
&#13;
Pension System Design Variables&#13;
&#13;
The characteristics of pension system design play a meaningful role in explaining pension fund&#13;
performance. Higher gross real returns are associated with occupational (rather than personal)&#13;
pension schemes, closed (rather than open) schemes, and pension systems with multiple&#13;
(rather than one) fund. Higher levels of volatility in pension system returns are associated with&#13;
mandatory (rather than voluntary) systems, systems without minimum guarantees, and&#13;
systems which permit higher levels of foreign investment. Differences between systems&#13;
generally emerge when incorporating the macroeconomic variables, financial sector variables,&#13;
and institutional variables as controls.&#13;
&#13;
Mandatory Versus Voluntary: whether systems are mandatory or voluntary is unrelated to&#13;
gross real return but positively related to volatility of gross real return (with mandatory systems&#13;
experiencing greater volatility). The coefficients suggest that mandatory systems have 2.0 to 3.4&#13;
percentage points greater three year standard deviations in gross real returns. It might be&#13;
tempting to try to explain this by observing that mandatory systems are predominantly found in&#13;
emerging economies which exhibit greater macroeconomic volatility â&#128;&#147; hence, this variable is&#13;
really a proxy for macroeconomic volatility (see Figure 2). However, this cannot be the case&#13;
because the model specification already accounts for the volatility of macroeconomic variables.&#13;
Moreover, we cannot say that rate of returns of mandatory pension systems are, in general,&#13;
more volatile than in voluntary systems (see Figure 3). Mandatory systems do seem to induce&#13;
higher volatility in returns once macroeconomic variables, financial sector variables,&#13;
institutional variables, and institutional variables are taken into account. Thus, a more likely&#13;
explanation is that fund managers take greater risks, on average, when participation in pension&#13;
schemes is mandated than they do when participation is voluntary.&#13;

              Note: fewer observations were available for the last two years of the sample.&#13;
&#13;
Occupational Versus Personal: occupational schemes generally earn higher returns on their&#13;
investments. Occupational schemes earned 6.53 percentage points more, on average, on their&#13;
investments than did pension systems with personal pension schemes.&#13;
&#13;
DC Versus DB: whether pension benefits are determined by a DC or DB benefit structure was&#13;
unrelated with either gross real return or volatility of gross real return. However, it must be&#13;
noted that while the DC schemes found in the data could be open or closed or occupational or&#13;
personal, the DB schemes are most often occupational and closed. This fact may explain the&#13;
lack of statistical significance for benefit structure.&#13;
&#13;
Open Versus Closed: the results for this dummy variable are identical to those for occupational&#13;
systems because closed systems are typically occupational systems (and vice versa). Thus,&#13;
closed systems generally earn higher returns although no statistically valid relationship&#13;
emerged for the volatility of those returns. As suggested in Appendix 3 (which reviews the&#13;
literature), investment strategies for closed and occupational systems are guided by asset-&#13;
liability (ALM) models which are more efficient than the models used by mutual funds (which&#13;
are a typical characteristic of open and personal system).&#13;

                 Note: fewer observations were available for the last two years of the sample.&#13;
&#13;
Minimum Guarantee: pension systems with minimum guarantees exhibit lower levels of&#13;
volatility although no relationship was observed with the returns themselves. The estimated&#13;
effect suggests that systems with minimum guarantees have, on average, three year standard&#13;
deviations that are 1.88 to 2.66 points lower. This can be explained either by more conservative&#13;
fund management or herding behavior.&#13;
&#13;
Multiple Funds: pension systems with multiple funds generate, on average, returns 7.2&#13;
percentage points higher than do systems with a single fund although no relationship was&#13;
observed with the volatility of those returns. As is discussed in Appendix 3, however, this&#13;
finding may be a consequence of the sampling period used in this study.&#13;
&#13;
Foreign Investment Limit: the foreign investment limit variable displays a negative relationship&#13;
with gross real return when it is the only explanatory variable. However, this relationship ceases&#13;
to be statistically significant when control variables are included. The foreign investment limit&#13;
variable is not significant by itself when explaining the volatility of pension system returns.&#13;
However, the relationship becomes significant when macroeconomic and financial sector&#13;
control variables are included (see Table 34). 11 For systems with no limits to foreign&#13;
investments (i.e., when foreign investment limit is equal to 100) volatility of gross real return is&#13;
2.1 percentage points higher it is for systems that prohibit all foreign investment when all&#13;
macroeconomic variables and financial sector variables are incorporated. As discussed in&#13;
Appendix 3, there is considerable debate on the impact of foreign investment on pension&#13;
system performance. Some studies have suggested that foreign investment does not affect&#13;
returns but does reduce the volatility of those returns (see Davis, 2002), but not all of the&#13;
&#13;
11&#13;
  It is important to note that quantitative limits on international investments are policy instruments which impact&#13;
the degree of capital account openness. Thus, an indirect effect may exist between restrictions on international&#13;
investment and the performance variables captured by the degree of capital account openness (as is discussed&#13;
further).&#13;

&amp;#12;previous work in this field has controlled for macroeconomic, financial sector, and institutional&#13;
variables. Furthermore, since this study relies on the most current data available, differences in&#13;
findings could be due to the time periods selected. This suggests that, more broadly, the&#13;
findings of this study should be treated as preliminary and not conclusive.&#13;

&amp;#12;Control Variables&#13;
&#13;
Macroeconomic Variables&#13;
&#13;
In general, many of the macroeconomic control variables are statistically related to both&#13;
performance measures. In the case of the pension system gross real return, positive coefficients&#13;
emerged for real GDP growth and capital account openness while negative coefficients&#13;
emerged for per capita GDP and inflation. In the case of volatility of gross real returns, these&#13;
same variables, as well as fiscal surplus, are determinant. Positive coefficients were found for&#13;
real GDP growth, per capita GDP, and inflation while negative coefficients were found for&#13;
capital account openness and fiscal surplus.&#13;
&#13;
Real GDP Growth: real GDP growth exhibits a positive relationship both with pension system&#13;
gross real return and with the three year standard deviation of those returns, but the&#13;
relationships are only statistically significant when macroeconomic variables, financial sector&#13;
variables, and institutional variables are incorporated into the specification as controls. A one&#13;
percentage point increase in the annual rate of real GDP growth is associated with an average&#13;
increase of 0.67 to 0.78 percentage points in gross real return. As is discussed in Appendix 3, an&#13;
increase in the growth rate of the economy can reasonably be expected to increase corporate&#13;
profits and, consequently, the return on equity. The fact that the standard deviation of the real&#13;
GDP growth rate is positively related to the standard deviation of the pension system return&#13;
once the macroeconomic variables have been incorporated as controls suggests that the&#13;
volatility of returns is, in part, explained by macroeconomic volatility as measured by the&#13;
standard deviation of real GDP growth.&#13;
&#13;
Per Capita GDP: per capita GDP exhibits a negative relationship with gross real return. A&#13;
$US1,000 increase in per capita GDP is associated with a reduction of -0.01 to -0.04 percentage&#13;
points in gross real return. The effect emerges in most specifications of the model. The higher&#13;
per capita GDP, the lower the real rate of return on capital. A positive relationship also&#13;
emerged with volatility of gross real return which, not surprisingly, suggests that countries with&#13;
greater macroeconomic instability also experience greater return volatility in the investment&#13;
returns earned by their pension systems.&#13;
&#13;
Inflation: the annual rate of inflation also displays a significant negative relationship with gross&#13;
real return while the three-year standard deviation of the inflation rate is positively associated&#13;
with volatility of gross real return. There are several possible explanations. Higher inflation may&#13;
(i) induce investors to hold more real assets thus reducing real rates of return; (ii) create&#13;
incentives to change production techniques to conserve cash which increases the capital-to-&#13;
labor ratio and depresses real rates of return on capital; and (iii) shorten the maturity of&#13;
available credit which pushes more borrowers into shorter term instruments that generally&#13;
provide lower rates of return. The positive relationship with volatility of gross real return&#13;
suggests (as observed earlier) that countries with greater macroeconomic instability also&#13;
experience greater return volatility in the investment returns earned by their pension systems.&#13;
The observed relationship, both with gross returns and the volatility of those returns emerges&#13;
in most of the specifications of the models (i.e., in both the raw data and when incorporating&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                18&#13;
&amp;#12;controls). An increase in inflation of one percentage point is associated with a reduction in real&#13;
returns of -0.4 to -0.5 percentage points; an increase of one point in the three year standard&#13;
deviation of inflation increases the volatility of gross real return by 0.4 to 0.5 points.&#13;
&#13;
Fiscal Surplus: the degree to which countries run a fiscal account surplus has no statistical&#13;
relationship with the gross returns earned by the countryâ&#128;&#153;s pension system. However, higher&#13;
volatility of the fiscal surplus expressed as a percent of GDP does reduce the volatility of&#13;
returns. This may seem counterintuitive. However, if higher volatility reflects countercyclical&#13;
fiscal policies, then the findings are quite reasonable (pro-cyclical fiscal policies, on the other&#13;
hand, reduce the volatility of the fiscal balance but then contribute to increased volatility of&#13;
GDP).&#13;
&#13;
Exchange Rate Growth and Real Interest Rate: neither exchange rate growth nor the real&#13;
interest rate is statistically related to either performance measure. As discussed in Appendix 3,&#13;
this may be due to hedging in the futures and derivatives markets by pension fund investment&#13;
managers.&#13;
&#13;
Capital Account Openness: the degree to which a countryâ&#128;&#153;s capital account is open is positively&#13;
related with gross real return and negatively related with volatility of gross real return. A one&#13;
percentage point increase in capital account openness is associated with an increase of 0.04 to&#13;
0.27 percentage points in the pension system gross real return and a reduction of 0.5 to 1.1&#13;
percentage points in the three year standard deviation of gross real returns. A possible&#13;
explanation is that the degree to which the capital account is open may expand the universe of&#13;
investment opportunities, thereby improving the efficiency of capital allocation in the&#13;
economy. Higher openness would also improve liquidity, thereby enabling portfolio managers&#13;
to adjust portfolio composition more efficiently, thereby, improving rates of returns. On the&#13;
other hand, the negative relationship between the variability of capital account openness and&#13;
the volatility of pension fund returns may be because greater openness in the account helps to&#13;
dampen price movements.&#13;

II.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Financial Sector Variables&#13;
&#13;
The financial sector variables generally exhibited less statistical relation to the two performance&#13;
measures than did the macroeconomic variables. Gross real returns were statistically positively&#13;
related to credit to the private sector and negatively related to stock of public debt. The&#13;
volatility of gross real return was statistically positively related both to credit to the private&#13;
sector and to stock market capitalization. This seems reasonable given that greater variability in&#13;
the amount of credit extended in the private sector and in the aggregate value of securities&#13;
traded should lead to greater variability in the returns earned by pension funds.&#13;
&#13;
Stock Market Capitalization: the size of the stock market relative to GDP is not statistically&#13;
related to pension system returns but is positively related to the volatility of those returns. The&#13;
relationship observed between the volatility of stock market capitalization and the volatility of&#13;
gross real return is not surprising given that pension funds often invest in equities.&#13;
&#13;
Corporate Bond Market Capitalization: the size of the corporate bond market relative to GDP is&#13;
not statistically related to either performance measure.&#13;
&#13;
Stock of Public Debt: the stock of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s public debt relative to its GDP is statistically&#13;
negative related to pension system returns but unrelated to the volatility of those returns. The&#13;
relationship is weak (the estimated coefficient is only -0.03) which suggests that large increases&#13;
in the amount of public debt are required to dampen investment returns. This seems&#13;
reasonable given that substantial increases in public debt create the expectation of higher taxes&#13;
and increase the cost of capital (by increasing the risk of default).&#13;
&#13;
Credit to the Private Sector: the amount of credit extended in the private sector as a&#13;
percentage of GDP (a measure of the depth of the financial economy) is statistically positively&#13;
related to both pension system returns and the volatility of those returns. A one percentage&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        20&#13;
&amp;#12;point increase in credit to the private sector is associated with an increase of 2.4 to 3.3&#13;
percentage points in gross real return. This relationship is significant when macroeconomic&#13;
variables are incorporated into the regression as controls. This implies that, for countries with&#13;
comparable macroeconomic circumstances, greater depth in the financial economy is&#13;
associated with higher returns on pension investments. This suggests that policy measures&#13;
aimed at deepening the financial economy could improve the landscape for pension fund&#13;
investment. The relationship between credit to the private sector and volatility of gross real&#13;
returns is unsurprising given that variability in the amount of credit extended in the private&#13;
sector points toward macroeconomic instability that can reasonably be expected to lead to&#13;
higher variability in asset prices.&#13;
&#13;
Institutional Variables&#13;
&#13;
In general, the three indexes were only weakly related to the two performance measures. For&#13;
real gross returns, only the anti self-dealing index was statistically significant; its relationship&#13;
was positive. For the volatility of those returns, none of the indexes were statistically&#13;
significant. A 0.1 increase in the index (index can take on values between zero and one) is&#13;
associated with a 0.8 to 1.5 percentage point increase in pension system returns. This suggests&#13;
that for countries which are comparable in terms of their macroeconomic and financial sector&#13;
characteristics, improving investor protection for minority shareholders â&#128;&#147; either by&#13;
strengthening the law or its enforcement â&#128;&#147; is associated with higher pension system returns.&#13;

IV.     CONCLUSIONS, LIMITATIONS, AND SUGGESTIONS FOR FUTURE WORK&#13;
This study has examined the relationship between two dependent variables (the real gross&#13;
rates of return earned on a countryâ&#128;&#153;s pension system investments and the volatility of those&#13;
returns as measured by their three year standard deviation) and (i) the key design attributes of&#13;
the countryâ&#128;&#153;s pension system and (ii) the characteristics of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s pension fund industry.&#13;
To account for differences among countries not related to the design of their pension systems&#13;
or characteristics of their pension industry, the study has controlled for cross-country&#13;
differences in macroeconomic, financial sector, and institutional variables.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       22&#13;
&amp;#12;To the extent that this topic has yet to be fully covered in the literature, this study breaks new&#13;
ground, most likely because of prior limitations regarding the availability of data. Considerable&#13;
work, however, remains to be done. Data is not yet available to explore other relationships that&#13;
might exist between the two performance measures and other aspects of pension system&#13;
design or characteristics of the structure of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s pension fund industry (two examples&#13;
include different approaches to market supervision than those addressed herein and the&#13;
levying of commissions by investment managers). In addition, it would be interesting to&#13;
compare pension system returns against a country-specific benchmark by representing returns&#13;
in excess of the rate earned on government bills (i.e., the least risky asset available) in each&#13;
country.&#13;
&#13;
Several methodological issues must be also be improved. The two performance measures of&#13;
investment performance could be made more nuanced (e.g., by considering investment&#13;
maturities and the structure of beneficiaries). The efficiency of investments also merits&#13;
consideration. As more data becomes available, the time period covered by the study can â&#128;&#147; and&#13;
should â&#128;&#147; be extended. Finally, the conclusions presented herein rely on stated asset valuations.&#13;
In the case of funds that invest only in listed securities in markets with reasonable liquidity,&#13;
valuation is not problematic. However, pension funds often invest in nonmarket securities&#13;
(including private equity and real estate, for example), many emerging markets lack enough&#13;
liquidity for price formation to be efficient, and valuation methodologies may differ&#13;
substantially across the countries in our sample.&#13;
&#13;
All findings presented herein should be treated as preliminary, of course, given that they rely on&#13;
a relatively short time horizon, a limited number of countries, and a limited number of&#13;
observations regarding pension fund characteristics. These limitations notwithstanding, this&#13;
study offers the following insights:&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Larger pension systems (i.e., those with more assets relative to GDP) tend to earn higher&#13;
         gross real rates of returns.&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   More mature pension systems (i.e., those that have been in existence longer) tend to&#13;
         experience less volatility in rates of return.&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Pension systems with greater competition (i.e., those with larger numbers of funds and&#13;
         those where the largest funds hold relatively small market shares) tend to experience&#13;
         less volatility in rates of return.&#13;
&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Higher gross real rates of return are associated with occupational (rather than personal)&#13;
         pension schemes, closed (rather than open) schemes, and pension systems with&#13;
         multiple (rather than one) fund. 12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12&#13;
  Pension system real returns may indirectly benefit from relaxing foreign investments limits as a result of its&#13;
impact on the openness of the capital account.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      23&#13;
&amp;#12;     â&#128;¢   Lower levels of volatility in rates of return are associated with voluntary (rather than&#13;
         mandatory) systems, systems with minimum guarantees, and systems which permit&#13;
         lower levels of foreign investment. 13&#13;
&#13;
In general, differences in performance measures still arise when macroeconomic variables,&#13;
financial sector variables, and institutional variables are introduced into the regression as&#13;
controls. When comparing countries with comparable macroeconomic variables (i.e.,&#13;
incorporating all variables simultaneously as controls), higher returns are associated with higher&#13;
rates of GDP growth, greater openness in the capital account, lower inflation, and lower GDP&#13;
per capita. Moreover (and as expected), greater volatility in these macroeconomic variables&#13;
(with the exception of capital account openness) is also associated with greater volatility in&#13;
pension system returns. Weaker relationships were observed between the two performance&#13;
measures and both financial system variables and institutional variables. Still, it is worth noting&#13;
(i) the positive relationship between pension system returns and the amount of credit extended&#13;
in the private sector, (ii) the positive relationship between the volatility of returns and the&#13;
volatility of the amount of credit extended in the private sector, and (iii) the positive&#13;
relationship between rates of return and the anti self-dealing index.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, the authors wish to encourage international donor organizations to devote more&#13;
resources to the collection and publishing of data on private pension funds in a more&#13;
systematic and regular way. Such investment would enable richer and more nuanced analysis of&#13;
pension fund performance and may reasonably be expected to identify public policy measures&#13;
that might improve pension fund investment management in ways that ultimately enable&#13;
national pension systems to generate higher levels of benefits for the same level of&#13;
contributions at lower risk to participants.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
13&#13;
  Restrictive investment limits also reduce capital account openness, indirectly â&#128;&#147; as is explained below â&#128;&#147; increasing&#13;
the volatility of pension system gross real returns. Thus, its net effect is ambiguous.&#13;

&amp;#12;                          APPENDIX 3: SUMMARY OF PRIOR RESEARCH&#13;
This study represents an initial effort to analyze the investment performance of national private&#13;
pension systems. The work began with a review of the relevant literature. A summary of that&#13;
literature, organized by variable, is presented below. The purpose of this discussion is to&#13;
provide additional background for the empirical work conducted in the main body of this&#13;
report. It should be noted, however, that studies of pension fund performance at the level of&#13;
individual countries are relatively scarce.&#13;
&#13;
Matters of Size&#13;
&#13;
In the United States, the pioneering work is Ippolito and Turner (1987) which studies 1526&#13;
pension plans in the United States. The authors use both the S&amp;P 500 and a stock-bond mix&#13;
index as benchmarks to study returns net of fees. They find that larger pension plans&#13;
substantially outperformed smaller ones. In the United Kingdom, the studies by Blake, Lehmann&#13;
and Timmermann (1999 and 2002) evaluates the returns of over 300 pension plans. Both&#13;
studies find underperformance with respect to external indices as benchmarks. Pension funds&#13;
in the Netherlands are analyzed, inter alia, by Van Riel et al. (2003) and Kakes (2006). The first&#13;
shows that at least a third of the shift in the 1990s in the investment portfolio of pension funds&#13;
towards foreign equity is attributable to a change in investment strategy on the part of the&#13;
largest pension fund. The second examines 77 pension funds and finds that large institutions&#13;
invest more assets in equities and tend to hold more foreign assets than do smaller ones.&#13;
Gerber (2005) used disaggregated data to analyze the behavior of the private pension funds in&#13;
Switzerland.&#13;
&#13;
Risk Mitigation&#13;
&#13;
A frequently used procedure for quantifying risk consists of determining the amount of money&#13;
that would be lost if a return is negative by a certain number of standard deviations (i.e., value&#13;
at risk or VaR) under the assumption that returns are normally distributed. However, this&#13;
approach underestimates risk since extreme outcomes are more frequently observed in&#13;
financial markets than would be expected if returns were distributed normally. Moreover,&#13;
extremely negative returns are more frequent than are extremely positive returns, which&#13;
implies that the distribution is not symmetrical about the mean. Furthermore, there are also&#13;
alternative investments to equity and bonds â&#128;&#147; such as real estate, private equity, venture&#13;
capital, commodities, derivatives, and hedge funds â&#128;&#147;which differ in terms of historical returns,&#13;
volatility, and interdependence (see Kakes and Broeders, 2006). Finally, risk reduction by means&#13;
of diversification is simple and can be achieved at very low cost in well-developed markets. It&#13;
may be more difficult to accomplish in less developed markets.&#13;
&#13;
Sophisticated pension funds and insurance companies assess overall risk in terms of the&#13;
characteristics and coherence of assets and liabilities on its balance sheet, a technique known&#13;
as asset and liability management (ALM) which has been used for some time. Under ALM,&#13;
liabilities constitute an integral element of an institutionâ&#128;&#153;s financial structure. In recent years,&#13;
changes in disclosure and regulation have increasingly highlighted the significance of a pension&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                64&#13;
&amp;#12;fundâ&#128;&#153;s overall risk profile, underscoring the need for and merits of ALM. 14 At the beginning of&#13;
this century, defined benefit pensions funds were hit by a double blow when both equity prices&#13;
and interest rates declined at the same time. This prompted declines in asset values and&#13;
increases in liabilities, thereby causing a sharp decline in the funding ratios of many defined&#13;
benefit pension plans (Boeri et al. 2006). As a consequence, many companies around the world&#13;
have shifted from defined benefit to defined contribution pension schemes, both to avoid the&#13;
IFRS reporting requirement and to reduce their risks. 15 This trend may be accelerated under the&#13;
current ongoing financial crisis given that it is deeper and expected to last longer. In the case of&#13;
the Dutch mandatory private pension pillar, both the switch from using final wages to career-&#13;
average wages in existing defined benefit plans and the introduction of defined contribution&#13;
elements to the scheme represent a shifting of risk from plan sponsors to participants (Ponds&#13;
and van Riel, 2007). With regard to single fund mandatory pension systems in Latin America,&#13;
MartÃ­nez and Murcia (2007) finds that risk based investment strategies to better match pension&#13;
assets with liabilities are lacking; accordingly, investment portfolios are not efficiently matched&#13;
to future liabilities or to the risk profile of many participants.&#13;
&#13;
The performance of pension fund investments are also vulnerable to interest rate risks. The&#13;
impact of real interest rates changes on investment performance is ambiguous. For example, if&#13;
the portfolio of a defined contribution plan is dominated by short term debt instruments, an&#13;
increase in real interest rates will improve performance. However, if portfolio composition is&#13;
dominated by long term debt instruments, performance will worsen. Finally, if the portfolio is&#13;
dominated by equities, an increase in real interest rates will worsen performance because&#13;
stocks prices typically fall when the cost of capital rises. In the case of a defined benefit pension&#13;
plan, a mismatch between the duration of assets and liabilities will make the plan vulnerable to&#13;
changes in the interest rate. Typically, pension funds adopt hedging strategies to mitigate&#13;
against such risks, but the securities are not available in many medium and smaller developing&#13;

Controversies on Investing in Equity as Opposed to Bonds&#13;
&#13;
There has been an intense debate over the merits of investing in equities by pension funds (see&#13;
Siegel, 1998, and Campbell and Viceira, 2002, among others). Advocates of investing in equities&#13;
cite two advantages: equities can be expected, on average, to generate higher expected returns&#13;
(a consequence of the equity risk premium) and the fact that the risk of loss for an equity&#13;
portfolio falls as the investment horizon increases (the time diversification effect). Others argue&#13;
that equity returns are mean-reverting (meaning that periods of disappointing returns are&#13;
followed by periods of above-average returns and vice versa). Another argument focuses on&#13;
&#13;
14&#13;
   According to IAS 19, implemented in 2005, under the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), listed&#13;
firms have to report unfunded liabilities associated with defined benefit pension schemes in their financial&#13;
statements. The emergence of fair value principles for pension fund accounting has forced pension funds to&#13;
redefine their risk management strategies (Kortleve et al. 2006).&#13;
15&#13;
   This bolstered the trend from defined benefit to defined contribution pension schemes in the United States and&#13;
United Kingdom (Munnell, 2006). In 2004, defined contribution pension assets amounted to 22% of total&#13;
occupational plan assets in the United Kingdom, 35% in the United States, and 9% in the Netherlands (OECD,&#13;
2006).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       65&#13;
&amp;#12;economic reasoning. In theory, the value of equities should be driven by a companyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
discounted future dividends. Dividends, in turn, depend on profits. On average, corporate&#13;
profits are fairly stable component of gross national product (GNP). In the long run, therefore,&#13;
profits (and, consequently, equity prices) should grow with the economy. A defined benefit&#13;
pension fundâ&#128;&#153;s real liabilities are determined by movements in wages and inflation. If equity&#13;
prices move in line with nominal economic developments, then they are an admittedly&#13;
imperfect hedge against both inflation and productivity growth which may trigger wage&#13;
increases (Kakes and Broeders, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
Critics of this investment strategy typically admit that the expected return on equities is higher&#13;
than that of bonds â&#128;&#147; otherwise investors would not be prepared to accept the risk â&#128;&#147; but they&#13;
point to the fact that there have been prolonged periods of sustained economic depression&#13;
during which time equities generated lower returns, on average, than did bonds. In addition,&#13;
economic theory suggests that the risk-adjusted return should be equal for all investments.&#13;
Thus, investing in equities should not in itself create value for a pension fund, but it will impose&#13;
different risks on stakeholders (see Siegelaer, 2003): higher expected returns result in a higher&#13;
probability of future increases in contribution rates (for defined benefit plans) and lower final&#13;
benefits (for defined contribution plans). See Kakes and Broeders (2006). Finally, the longer the&#13;
investment horizon, the greater the possibility of sharply negative outliers (see Kakes and&#13;
Broeders, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
No consensus exists in the literature about the mean reversion property of equity returns.&#13;
Some studies find significant negative autocorrelation over a horizon of several years. In some&#13;
cases, however, this may be due to the period chosen for the study and to measurement errors&#13;
resulting from small samples. Even if it exists, mean reversion is not a valid argument according&#13;
to Bodie (1995) which brings option valuation theory to bear on the question. If it is assumed&#13;
that in the longer run equities are less risky, then the premium for insurance against&#13;
underfunding should decrease with time. Bodie shows that the opposite is true: the longer the&#13;
term to maturity, the higher the value of the put option needed to provide protection from&#13;
underfunding. Because no market exists for options contracts with very long maturities,&#13;
however, the validity of this theoretical analysis cannot be assessed in practice (see Kakes and&#13;
Broeders, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
Finally, there is an alleged interrelationship between equity returns and inflation, but the&#13;
relationship is, by no means, beyond dispute. Notably, the 1970s â&#128;&#147; a period of marked inflation&#13;
â&#128;&#147; was also one of the worst decades in terms of equity returns (Kakes and Broeders, 2006).&#13;
&#13;
Pension Funds and Asset Prices&#13;
&#13;
No hard evidence exists to support the assertion that asset prices behaved differently before&#13;
and after the introduction of funded pension systems (see Bebczuk and Musalem, 2008a).&#13;
Although little research has thus far been published, at least two studies are consistent with&#13;
this view. Walker and Lefort (2002) shows that pension funds had a stabilizing effect on security&#13;
prices across a sample of 33 emerging countries â&#128;&#147; a finding at odds with the price pressure&#13;
presumably introduced by funded pension schemes. Voronkova and Bohl (2003) demonstrates&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                66&#13;
&amp;#12;that securities prices in Poland were not significantly influenced by the trading of securities by&#13;
pension funds.&#13;
&#13;
Investment Regulations and Performance&#13;
&#13;
Regulatory provisions and other features of the pension scheme design also impact&#13;
performance, particular in the case of mandatory defined contribution schemes (see Bebczuk&#13;
and Musalem, 2008a). First, pension funds are typically restricted to buying securities that are&#13;
listed, liquid, and rated. While this is sensible from the perspective of containing risk, it has had&#13;
the pervasive effect of perpetuating a historical concentration of trading in a few securities and&#13;
discouraging new firms from coming to market. Second, strict investment guidelines on&#13;
portfolio composition may have outright prevented (or created incentives to discourage)&#13;
investment managers from constructing portfolios that efficiently balance return and risk.&#13;
Third, pension funds are in many cases parts of financial conglomerates; this may partly explain&#13;
their bias toward bank deposits. Finally, features of some pension systems â&#128;&#147; such as&#13;
guaranteed minimum returns, the use of relative benchmarks based on the performance of the&#13;
overall industry, and salary-based commissions â&#128;&#147; may discourage pension fund managers from&#13;
searching for new issuers and instruments.&#13;
&#13;
The establishment of a minimum return relative to the industry-wide return creates an&#13;
asymmetry of incentives (fund managers are penalized for underperforming the market but not&#13;
as rewarded for over performing). This encourages herding behavior whereby all managers buy&#13;
a similar portfolio, an apparent lack of shareholder activism, and a narrower offering of&#13;
securities. See Jara, 2006, Laserna, 2007, Reveiz and Leon, 2007, Reveiz et al., 2007, and&#13;
Bebczuk and Musalem, 2008a). Voronkova and Bohl (2003) provides evidence of herding among&#13;
Polish pension funds; Srinivas, Whitehouse, and Yermo (2000) observes the same pattern in&#13;
Latin American countries. One might conclude that competition among pension funds for new&#13;
clients should substitute for the absence of other performance incentives; yet, workers in many&#13;
countries that have introduced multipillar pension reforms continue, for the most part, to view&#13;
contributions as taxes and do not choose their fund in a way that exerts any meaningful market&#13;
discipline (see CEF, 2008).&#13;
&#13;
Several studies have been published on the impact of investment restrictions on the investment&#13;
performance of pension funds. See Berstein and Chumacero (2005) for Chile, Pereda (2007) for&#13;
Peru, and Carriedo (2007) for Mexico, respectively. Berstein and Chumacero (2005) quantifies â&#128;&#147;&#13;
using a counterfactual exercise â&#128;&#147; the cost of investment limits on portfolio returns for the&#13;
period 1981 to 2002, prior to the implementation of multifunds. Three investment strategies&#13;
were considered: (i) a minimum variance portfolio, (ii) portfolio management based on&#13;
quadratic preferences, and (iii) an efficient portfolio based on VaR. The results suggest that the&#13;
costs of imposing investment limits can be considerable. In the absence of limits, the total&#13;
assets managed by the pension system could have been at least 10% larger. On the other hand,&#13;
Pereda (2007) estimates the impact of investment limits on the efficient frontier of pension&#13;
funds in Peru for the period 1995-2004 and concludes that returns were lower than optimal by&#13;
2.5% annually, of which 1.9 percentage points are attributable to investment limits and 0.6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                 67&#13;
&amp;#12;percentage points are attributable to the fact that fund managers were not, on average,&#13;
investing portfolios efficiently. 16 Finally, Carriedo (2007) estimates that the flexible investment&#13;
regulations in Mexico, introduced since the start of the system until 2007, have increased&#13;
annual average returns by 127 basis points since 1997 and 301 basis points in the last 12&#13;
months.&#13;
&#13;
Other studies have shown that the portfolios of many mandatory pension funds are financially&#13;
inefficient within the regulatory framework under which they operate. Put simply: for same&#13;
level of risk, funds could increase their expected returns, see Jara, GÃ³mez and Pardo (2005)&#13;
which estimates that financial regulations in Colombia have reduced returns by one percentage&#13;
point, while portfolio managers themselves have adopted inefficient strategies that have&#13;
reduced returns by another percentage point. Reveiz and Leon (2007) and Reveiz et al. (2007)&#13;
show for Colombia that the length of efficient frontiers without investment restrictions is&#13;
significantly larger than frontiers with investment restrictions. This suggests that regulatory&#13;
limits on investments significantly constrain the efficient set of portfolios available to pension&#13;
funds (i.e., they reduce access to superior levels of Sharpe ratios and higher diversification).&#13;
&#13;
Single Versus Multiple Funds&#13;
&#13;
There are several approaches to investment regulation. On one extreme are systems based on&#13;
regulations that specify quantitative limits to investment; on the other are systems where&#13;
regulation only imposes a prudent person standard for portfolio management. In between are&#13;
other approaches. One way to make the investment regime flexible is to open the market to&#13;
multiple funds. This allows funds to cater to the risk preferences and investment horizons of&#13;
certain groups of plan members while permitting more efficient portfolio management in&#13;
relation to the life cycle and restoring regulatory consistency between instruments and&#13;
objectives. The economy as a whole benefits from such an approach as resources are allocated&#13;
more efficiently. According to Cheyre (2006), the introduction of multiple funds in Chile&#13;
increased the average annual rate of return of all funds by 2.4 percentage points over the&#13;
period September 2002 to December 2006. Cumulative real returns since the inception of&#13;
multifunds in Chile (September 2002 to June 2007) comport with financial theory: higher&#13;
returns have been earned by more diversified funds (including those with both domestic and&#13;
international assets). The risk profile of different funds since year 2002 has also been consistent&#13;
with theory: greater volatility has been observed for funds with higher exposure to variable&#13;
income instruments while the least volatile fund had no exposure to variable income&#13;
instruments (see Conrads, 2007).&#13;
&#13;
International Diversification&#13;
&#13;
Despite the existence of general consensus that international diversification should generally be&#13;
beneficial, it is not entirely free of controversy (see Bebczuk and Musalem, 2008b). Burtless&#13;
&#13;
16&#13;
  The impact of investment limits on the performance of pension funds in Peru is investigated further in Rivas-&#13;
Llosa and Camargo (2002). It uses daily data between April and September 2002 and finds a lower real risk&#13;
adjusted return relative to the optimum portfolio (0.323 vs. 0.463).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      68&#13;
&amp;#12;(2007) is rigorous and compelling study in support of foreign investment by developed&#13;
countries in emerging countries â&#128;&#147; and vice versa â&#128;&#147; using financial return data from large&#13;
countries over an extended period from 1927 to 2005. Relying on more conventional portfolio&#13;
outcomes, Roldos (2004) and Chan-Lau (2004) both advocate for increased foreign investments&#13;
by pension funds in Latin America. AlegrÃ­a (2005) shows that the returns generated by&#13;
internationally diversified pension portfolios in Chile dominated those generated by&#13;
domestically focused portfolios between 1990 and 2004. Using a similar approach, Jara, GÃ³mez&#13;
and Pardo (2005) shows that restrictions to foreign investment significantly reduce the&#13;
potential efficiency of pension portfolios in Colombia. Consequently, portfolios are&#13;
concentrated in domestic assets with highly correlated returns â&#128;&#147; but this risk is not reflected in&#13;
a higher expected return (MartÃ­nez and Murcia, 2007).&#13;
&#13;
Some empirical studies, however, are less enthusiastic about the efficiency gains that accrue&#13;
from holding more foreign assets. Davis (2002) studies 10 OECD countries and three emerging&#13;
economies between 1970 and 1995 and compares actual pension fund returns (and the&#13;
volatility associated with those returns) with the returns that would have been earned by four&#13;
hypothetical portfolios holding (i) domestic bonds and equities in equal shares, (ii) 20% foreign&#13;
assets, (iii) 40% foreign assets, and (iv) a global portfolio comprising all markets weighted by&#13;
their corresponding capitalizations. Although the hypothetical portfolios all delivered higher&#13;
returns than were actually earned, the internationally diversified portfolios generated similar&#13;
returns to a portfolio of domestic equities and bonds in equal shares â&#128;&#147; and were only slightly&#13;
less risky.&#13;
&#13;
These studies capture the dilemma facing portfolio managers: higher returns (which could be&#13;
attained by increasing the share of foreign assets in investment portfolios) necessarily entail&#13;
higher risks (see Bebczuk and Musalem, 2008b). Moving further along the efficient frontier&#13;
(that is, seeking higher returns without incurring any more risk than is necessary from the&#13;
perspective of efficiency) forces asset managers to significantly increase their holdings of&#13;
foreign assets. The overall conclusion is that international investment may help pension fund&#13;
managers create more efficient portfolios â&#128;&#147; that is, attain the same expected returns with less&#13;
risk â&#128;&#147; in some, but not all, cases. However, there are cases where such a move will only&#13;
enhance returns if managers are willing to accept more risk (see Reveiz and Leon 2007). Finally,&#13;
Reveiz et al. (2007) points out that effective diversification helps to reduce risk for the same&#13;
level of expected return.&#13;
&#13;
Although foreign investment, on the whole, appears to be a viable strategy for boosting&#13;
returns, the conclusions is necessarily based ex post on market performance. Past performance&#13;
may not always prove to be a good predictor of future performance. Finding, thus, depend on&#13;
the time periods and countries sampled (see Bebczuk and Musalem, 2008b). Moreover, Solnik,&#13;
Bourcrelle, and Le Fur (1996) identifies another problem: correlations in asset returns across&#13;
countries increase strongly when markets are turbulent, a situation which is only likely to grow&#13;
more significant over time as financial markets become increasingly integrated.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               69&#13;
&amp;#12;Management Fees&#13;
&#13;
Jara (2006) shows that when fund managers are not allowed to levy commissions based on the&#13;
returns they earn on behalf of participants, they may not face adequate incentives to pick&#13;
efficient portfolios. 17&#13;
&#13;
Investor Rights, Transparency and Corporate Governance&#13;
&#13;
Bebczuk and Musalem (2008b) argues that the legal enforcement of investor rights and&#13;
transparency with respect to reporting and enterprise behavior are essential to the efficient&#13;
functioning of financial markets. This is particularly true for emerging markets when it comes to&#13;
attracting foreign investment because the informational asymmetries associated with investing&#13;
in such markets are often severe. The lack of such safeguards in some emerging markets can&#13;
reasonably be expected to discourage investment in those markets by foreign pension funds. It&#13;
is worth noting that the existence of a good legal and regulatory framework does not&#13;
necessarily imply effective compliance and enforcement. A related issue is the absence of&#13;
proper standards for corporate governance (or the ineffectiveness of mechanisms for enforcing&#13;
those standards) and the presence of controlling shareholders (see Bebczuk and Musalem,&#13;
2008b). These conditions can foster the development of agency problems and the&#13;
expropriation of value by insiders at the expense of minority shareholders. Bebczuk (2007) and&#13;
Klapper and Love (2002), among others, discusses such conflicts of interest and provides&#13;
evidence to demonstrate the existence of poor corporate governance in some emerging&#13;
markets. Such an environment tends to discourage flows of investment capital into those&#13;
markets. McKinsey &amp; Company (2002) surveyed 200 major international institutional investors&#13;
and found that 84% of them considered the existence of a good corporate governance&#13;
framework to be at least as important as the financial condition and prospects of emerging&#13;
market companies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
17&#13;
  Moreover, the management fees paid to the managers of mandatory pension funds of Latin America and&#13;
Eastern and Central Europe are calculated on the basis of monthly contributions from pension participants and&#13;
their employers. Hence, commissions are paid once per unit of contribution regardless of how long those&#13;
contributions are ultimately invested.&#13;

&amp;#12;Abstract&#13;
&#13;
This study investigates the performance of private pensions systems across countries â&#128;&#148; a&#13;
topic which has yet to be adequately addressed in the literature. Specifically, this study&#13;
examines the relationship between pension fund performance (as captured by gross real&#13;
rates of return and the three year standard deviation of those returns) and the structure&#13;
of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s private pension industry and the design of its pension schemes. A database&#13;
covering 27 countries over the period 1990-2007 was created for this research. The studyâ&#128;&#153;s key&#13;
findings include (i) higher returns are associated with size (systems with more assets under&#13;
management tend to generate higher returns), type (occupational schemes tend to generate&#13;
higher returns than do personal pension schemes and closed schemes tend to generate higher&#13;
returns than do open schemes), and number (systems with multiple funds tend to generate&#13;
higher returns than those with a single fund) and (ii) lower volatility in pension system&#13;
returns is associated with older systems, voluntary (rather than mandatory) systems, systems&#13;
with restrictions on foreign investing, and systems with minimum return guarantees.&#13;

            This study investigates the performance
            of private pensions systems across countries a topic which
            has yet to be adequately addressed in the literature.
            Specifically, this study examines the relationship between
            pension fund performance (as captured by gross real rates of
            return and the three year standard deviation of those
            returns) and the structure of a country's private
            pension industry and the design of its pension schemes. A
            database covering 27 countries over the period 1990-2007 was
            created for this research. The study's key findings
            include: (i) higher returns are associated with size
            (systems with more assets under management tend to generate
            higher returns), type (occupational schemes tend to generate
            higher returns than do personal pension schemes and closed
            schemes tend to generate higher returns than do open
            schemes), and number (systems with multiple funds tend to
            generate higher returns than those with a single fund); and
            (ii) lower volatility in pension system returns is
            associated with older systems, voluntary (rather than
            mandatory) systems, systems with restrictions on foreign
            investing, and systems with minimum return guarantees.
