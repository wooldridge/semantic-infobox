               MEMORANDUM         AND RECOMMENDATION            OF THE PRESIDENT&#13;
                                             OF THE&#13;
           INTERNATIONAL       BANK   FOR RECONSTRUCTION           AND DEVELOPMENT&#13;
                               TO THE EXECUTIVE         DIRECTORS&#13;
                      ON A PROPOSED      AMENDMENT         AND WAIVERS      TO&#13;
                                SECOND    AND THIRD      TRANCHES&#13;
                          AND RELEASE      OF THE SECOND       TRANCHE&#13;
         FOR ARGENTINA      - SANTA   FE PROVINCIAL        REFORM    ADJUSTMENT      LOAN&#13;
                                       (LOAN  NO. 4634-AR)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 1.      The Santa Fe Provincial Reform Adjustment Loan (Ln 4634-AR) for US$330 million&#13;
 was approved by the Board in August 2001 and became effective in September 2001. The loan&#13;
 comprises three tranches, payable at the Bank's standard interest rate for LIBOR-based dollar&#13;
 loan, with a grace period of 5 years, a final maturity in 15 years, and a level repayment of&#13;
 principal. The first tranche in the amount of US$153.3 million was released on September 20,&#13;
 2001. The accompanying Tranche Release Document for the second tranche of US$50 million&#13;
 sets forth the description of tranche conditions, status of compliance of the Borrower, and&#13;
proposed amendment/waivers to both the second and third tranches.&#13;
2.       The Loan is designed to support the implementation of a program by the Borrower Santa&#13;
Fe Province aimed at reforming its government so as to ensure an efficient and responsive&#13;
delivery of public services within fiscally sound policies. While the Province has largely been&#13;
able to successfully implement the program, due to the impact of the severe macroeconomic&#13;
developments in Argentina and the resulting deterioration in social conditions, the Loan is being&#13;
reformulated in terms of waivers/amendments to individual conditions.          In keeping with the&#13;
original development objective, the reformulated loan would continue to support the Province of&#13;
Santa Fe's reform efforts to achieve fiscal stability at the provincial level and promote structural&#13;
reforms to improve the efficiency, quality and equity of public spending, particularly in the&#13;
social sectors.&#13;
3.       The Santa Fe Provincial Reform Adjustment Loan is subject to the provisions of the&#13;
Bank's former disclosure policy.     As such, and after confirmation with the Province and the&#13;
Borrower, the accompanying Tranche ReleaseDocument will not be made publicly available.&#13;
4.       Recommendation.       In view    of the overall performance and progress with          the&#13;
implementation of the program supported by the Santa Fe Provincial reform Adjustment Loan, I&#13;
recommend that the Executive Directors approve the proposed amendment/waiver and the&#13;
tranche release. Following approval by the Executive Directors and the entry into effect of a&#13;
letter of amendment to the Loan Agreement, the Bank will notify the Borrower of the availability&#13;
of the disbursement of the second tranche in the amount of US$50 million equivalent.&#13;

                               Tranche Release Document&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 1.     This tranche release document seeks the approval of the Executive Directors to&#13;
amend the loan agreement for the Provincial Reform Adjustment Loan - Santa Fe (Ln&#13;
4634-AR) on the terms described in paragraphs 26-34 below. The proposed amendment&#13;
would adjust the conditionality previously agreed with the Province of Santa Fe to the&#13;
dramatic changes in the macroeconomic, investment, social and political environment in&#13;
Argentina following the abandonment of convertibility in January 2002, while ensuring&#13;
the permanence and relevance of the objectives of its reform program. Specifically, the&#13;
changes in the fiscal, debt, and investment conditions and the strong resurgence of social&#13;
conflict have substantially modified the priorities and conditions prevailing at the time&#13;
this Loan was approved. The Province has, on the other hand, effectively adapted its&#13;
short and medium term priorities within the context of the overall reform objectives, to&#13;
deal with the social and economic emergency. The proposed amendment remains firmly&#13;
grounded in the overall objectives of the program to achieve fiscal stability at the&#13;
provincial level and promote structural reforms to improve the efficiency, quality and&#13;
equity of public spending, particularly in the social sectors.&#13;
&#13;
2.       The proposed reformulation would amend the original second and third tranches&#13;
of $50 million   and $126.7 million,   respectively.   It provides for the reframing of a&#13;
consistent program in response to the changes in the environment, with upfront and&#13;
formal agreement on new targets neededto achieve the agreed development goals. At the&#13;
same time, Santa Fe has continued to move forcefully          in implementing its reform&#13;
program.   Upon the Board's approval of the proposed reformulation, and signing and&#13;
effectiveness of the amendment, the second tranche would become available for&#13;
withdrawal.&#13;
&#13;
                                Part 1 - Country Context&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Recent Economic Developments&#13;
&#13;
3.      The Argentine economy is emerging from the deepest recession in generations,&#13;
with its GDP having fallen by 20 percent in the last four years and by 10.9 percent in&#13;
2002 alone. Per capita income at the end of 2002 stood at an estimated US$2,695, down&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                   -2-&#13;
&#13;
 from over 8,000 in the 1997/98 period'.              Poverty has increased to 58 percent, with&#13;
 indigence levels affecting 28 percent of the population or about 9 million.&#13;
&#13;
 4.       The culmination of this crisis is associatedwith the collapse of the Convertibility&#13;
 Plan, which extracted an increasingly and finally unsustainable high social and economic&#13;
 cost2 Compounding this was the declaration of default on Argentina's public debt, the&#13;
 ill-prepared devaluation, and the asymmetric pesification of the financial system, all of&#13;
 which have had damaging effects on macroeconomic management, viability                          of the&#13;
 financial system, credibility of government action, and the rule of law.&#13;
&#13;
 5.       After an initial period of heightened economic, social, and political uncertainty,&#13;
 the Argentine economy displayed signs of bottoming out around the middle of 2002.&#13;
 Since then indications of an incipient recovery based on improved consumer sentiment&#13;
 and import substitution have multiplied, with positive developments becoming clearer&#13;
 and stronger in recent months. These were reflected in the trend of the quarterly GDP in&#13;
 2002 which contracted by over 16 percent during the first quarter compared to the same&#13;
period of the previous year, but improved about equally, on a seasonally adjusted quarter&#13;
 to quarter basis, by 0.7 percent in each of the three subsequent quarters3. Consequently,&#13;
economic growth in 2002 declined by 10.9 percent. Industrial production also showed an&#13;
 accelerating positive monthly trend since the second quarter of 2002, with year on year&#13;
indicators signaling positive growth starting in the fourth quarter of 2002.&#13;
&#13;
6.        The current Government has made important strides towards reverting some of&#13;
the negative impact of the crisis under very difficult social and political conditions. Key&#13;
to these achievements have been the controls over the fiscal situation as well as the&#13;
pursuit of a restrained monetary policy.             There is, however, a broad and substantial&#13;
agenda for structural reforms that remains to be tackled in order to insure that the recent&#13;
signs of economic improvement can be sustained and accelerated. Reforms in areassuch&#13;
as the financial sector, corporate restructuring,            public utilities services, public sector&#13;
management, reform in fiscal relations with the provinces, external debt restructuring,&#13;
and investment climate will have to wait until a new administration takes office.&#13;
&#13;
7.        With regard to fiscal policy, the Government tightly controlled expenditures,&#13;
especially of wages and pensions, but relied on export taxes and the financial transaction&#13;
tax to collect more than 3 percent of GDP in revenues. Average monthly revenues rose&#13;
from Arg$ 3.2 billion in the first four months of 2002, coinciding with the depth of the&#13;
recession, to Arg$ 5.0 billion in the following eight months, marking an average increase&#13;
in revenues of 54 percent, which surpassed the rate of inflation, and reflects the gradual&#13;
improvement in economic activity and tax collection efforts. As a result, the primary&#13;
deficits of the first four months of 2002 turned into surpluses in the remainder of the year,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
' According to the Bank's Atlas methodology,    per capita GNI in 2002 declined to $4,060 from $8,030 in&#13;
1998.&#13;
&#13;
' For an evaluation of the causes of the Argentine crisis please see "Argentina; A Retrospective Review",&#13;
distributed to the Board in July 2002.&#13;
3Quarterly growth figures for 2002 were -16.3%, -13.5%, -9.8%, and -3.6%, in that order.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             -3-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 generating a primary     surplus of 0.7 percent of GDP for the year as a whole.&#13;
Nevertheless, the overall cash balance of the Federal Government remained in deficit (-&#13;
 1.6 percent of GDP), despite the non-payment of interest obligations because of the&#13;
 default conditions.&#13;
&#13;
 8.      On provincial finances, the Central Government signed agreements with the&#13;
provinces on reducing the combined provincial deficit by 60 percent during 2002. The&#13;
 outcome of the agreement has been better than expected, with the combined provincial&#13;
deficit having been cut by 74 percent from Arg$6.8 billion in 2001 to Arg$l.8 billion by&#13;
eliminating a primary fiscal deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP during 2002. For 2003, it is&#13;
planned that the provincial deficits will be cut further to Arg$l.l billion. To this end, the&#13;
Government has already signed agreements with eleven provinces representing 95&#13;
percent of the overall 2002 provincial deficit. Further improvements in provincial fiscal&#13;
performance are needed to obtain fiscal sustainability of the consolidated public sector,&#13;
and reform of the federal-provincial fiscal agreement (coparticipacion) is a challenge for&#13;
the immediate future.&#13;
&#13;
9.      Monetary policy     has contributed significantly     to the improvement      in the&#13;
macroeconomic situation. Key to this has been the change in rediscount policy, which&#13;
increasingly sterilized the liquidity support extended towards banks in response to the&#13;
judicial rulings in favor of liberalizing blocked deposits, so-called "amparos".         The&#13;
decline of international reserves during the first half of 2002 was another source of&#13;
monetary absorption. The fiscal and monetary policy stance have resulted in a significant&#13;
lowering of the monthly inflation rate from about 4 percent in the first half of 2002, to 1.3&#13;
percent during the second half year, to about 1 percent during the first quarter of 2003.&#13;
Interest rates have also fallen significantly since the middle of the year, with fixed term&#13;
deposit rates having declined from about 80 percent in July 2002 to 15 percent in January&#13;
2003 and the prime rate from 90 percent to 27 percent during the same period.&#13;
&#13;
10.     Progress has been made in other areasas well. A flexible exchange rate has been&#13;
established following the temporary introduction of multiple exchange rates. The fiscal&#13;
and monetary policies together with capital controls that were re-introduced extensively&#13;
in 2002, supported an exchange rate policy that resulted in a relatively stable exchange&#13;
rate of Arg$ 3.66 per US$l from June through November 2002. Towards the end of&#13;
2002, the incipient recovery and the increasing international reserves position, in part due&#13;
to the accumulation of payment arrears and a large trade surplus started to exert&#13;
appreciating pressures on the exchange rate. To arrest a too quick of an appreciation, the&#13;
Central Bank has increasingly lifted capital controls since the end of last December. At&#13;
mid-April, the exchange rate stood at around Arg$2.9 to US$l, and foreign reserves had&#13;
reachedUS$10.5 billion.&#13;
&#13;
11.     The external financing crisis and recession was reflected in the swift reversal in&#13;
the external accounts. With a precipitous decline in imports of 55.8 percent, and despite&#13;
a lackluster export performance, the trade balance in goods and services improved from a&#13;
US$3.5 billion surplus in 2001 to US$15.4 billion last year, helping generate a US$13.5&#13;
billion swing in the current account. The traded goods balance continued to be in large&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             -4-&#13;
&#13;
 surplus in January 2003, when it reached US$1.3 billion compared to US$970 million in&#13;
 the same month of 2002. A similar surplus was obtained in the month of February.&#13;
&#13;
 12.     To summarize developments in the first months of 2003, the economy stayed on&#13;
 its recovery path. By March 2003, industrial production was 21.4 percent higher than a&#13;
 year ago, albeit from levels that characterized the trough of the economic crisis. Inflation&#13;
 remained moderate, and trade balances exhibited large surpluses. Fiscal performance&#13;
 improved further, principally    from improved income tax collections, with revenues&#13;
 coming better than expected in the Fund's program.        Exchange controls were further&#13;
eased, and banking deposits were liberalized.            Commitments    to improve      fiscal&#13;
performance in the provinces were reached, and the Government launched a program for&#13;
the monetary unification.     Between the beginning of the year and mid-April,     the peso&#13;
appreciated by 15 percent, and international reservescontinued to build up.&#13;
&#13;
 13,     These impressive achievements however remain fragile         as long as important&#13;
issues have yet to be resolved. The Argentine banking system has been significantly&#13;
weakened, first by the massive withdrawal of deposits in 2001, and second by the loss of&#13;
confidence resulting from the partial freeze of bank accounts, the forced conversion of&#13;
dollar deposits, and associated policy decisions (asymmetric pesification, preferential&#13;
treatment of debtors, etc.). With about 50 percent of bank assets currently held in the&#13;
form of government bonds, the future viability of the banking system depends, among&#13;
other factors, on the outcome of the public debt workout, and valuation of such bonds.&#13;
Depositors have suffered significant losses, and access to the remaining deposits were&#13;
circumscribed.      Important economic dislocations occurred with the imposition           of&#13;
restrictions on access to banking deposits. Nevertheless, gradually, sight and savings&#13;
deposits and more recently time deposits have been liberalized. But, the financial&#13;
intermediation process has been severely disrupted.         No credible resolution to the&#13;
banking crisis has yet been defined, and the future of the banking system is uncertain.&#13;
Confidence on the banking system has plummeted, as banks suffered high operational&#13;
losses and a sharp increase in their non-performing loans. The weakening of the banking&#13;
system, and the continuous decline in credit associated with significant contraction of&#13;
investment, are limiting    factors to a sustained economic recovery.       While cautious&#13;
measures are being taken to strengthen the banking system, the redollarization of deposits&#13;
(ruled by the Supreme Court in one case only, but opening the door for more widespread&#13;
application) remains a risk to the banking system, as it could increase its losses, and&#13;
dependenceon public transfers.&#13;
&#13;
14.      Private contracts have been breached - for example, all private contracts&#13;
denominated in dollars were pesified at the old exchange rate of one-to-one and mortgage&#13;
executions were suspended -, and the legal framework for their renegotiation has been&#13;
undermined through inopportune legislation (only recently new bankruptcy legislation&#13;
established a minimum acceptable legal framework for the protection of creditors and&#13;
debtors).   Utility  rates have been frozen, threatening the future provision of public&#13;
services (recent minimal price adjustment in utilities have been suspended by a court&#13;
decision). Property and creditor rights have been violated in a wholesale manner, and&#13;
unless such rights are credibly reestablished, economic recovery will be curtailed.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             -5-&#13;
&#13;
 15.    The Government has defaulted on various domestic and most international&#13;
obligations.    Consequently, Argentina has no access to the international financial&#13;
markets.    Currently, the authorities have began the long process of reaching out to&#13;
international creditors. However, the process of debt renegotiation promises to be long&#13;
and arduous, and some creditors have initiated legal action to attach Argentine assets&#13;
abroad. In the process of pesification, massive wealth transfers from creditors to debtors&#13;
and, in particular, from the state to debtors have occurred. As a result of the&#13;
compensations to banks and depositors the state has already issued sizable amounts of&#13;
new debt, thereby increasing difficulties for the future servicing of debt in default.&#13;
&#13;
16.     Argentina's prospects   for 2003 are for the continuation of the current recovery in&#13;
output and the maintenance of the fiscal and monetary stability reached over the second&#13;
half of 2002. The prospects for output recovery reflect the depth of the output decline of&#13;
the last four years, and the opportunities provided by the sharp devaluation of the&#13;
currency.   The recovery in consumption, and import substituting activities could be&#13;
leading the recovery, with real GDP growth projected to reach about 4 percent.&#13;
However, significant uncertainty accompanies any such expectations, given the need to&#13;
address urgently fundamental structural reforms.       In the absence of normalization of&#13;
relations with the international financial community, which would require both a debt&#13;
restructuring and a sustainable fiscal framework, the reestablishment of a functioning&#13;
financial system, and renewed credibility to public institutions, the ongoing economic&#13;
recovery is unlikely to translate into sustained economic growth.&#13;
&#13;
17.     In the meantime, an interim economic and financing program has been agreed&#13;
with the IFIs, covering the January to August 2003 period. The Government estimates&#13;
that the total external financing gap during this period is in the order of US$l 1.6 billion.&#13;
This financing gap is expected to be met by new disbursements of the IMF of about&#13;
US$2.9 billion and the extension of repurchase expectations amounting to US$3.7 billion&#13;
as well as by disbursements from the World Bank and IDB in the order of US$2.2 billion&#13;
each.   In February 2003       the Paris Club agreed to a rescheduling of debt service&#13;
amounting to about US$O.7 billion.&#13;

The Social Situation&#13;
&#13;
18.       The social impact of the crisis has been devastating. Using data from the official&#13;
household survey and recently compiled World Bank household survey (with greater&#13;
geographical coverage), this section documents the effects of the crisis on poverty, and&#13;
labor markets (see Figure 2 and Table 2).                                       During 2002, poverty trends worsened&#13;
dramatically. The share of population considered poor grew to approximately 58 percent&#13;
while the number of extreme poor nearly doubled.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 19.       The economic crisis has had a strong negative impact on the access and use of&#13;
 education and health services and there is growing evidence of the deterioration in&#13;
 service delivery and key indicators of well-being.                       Coverage and financing of formal&#13;
 health insurance has dropped significantly, following the destruction of jobs in the formal&#13;
 sector.       Roughly      12 percent of individuals                with    formal health insurance either&#13;
 discontinued (60 percent of the total), or reduced their coverage. The trend has&#13;
 contributed to an increase in the use of already financially strapped public hospitals, the&#13;
 traditional provider for the uninsured. The crisis has forced families to cut down on&#13;
 health services. More than one-third of households with children under the age of 12&#13;
 reported having reduced the frequency with which they take their children for medical&#13;
 checkups (roughly half of those households belong to the lowest quintile of the income&#13;
 distribution). There are concerns about the emergence of casesof child malnutrition. 4&#13;
&#13;
 20.       In the education sector there are no indications of aggravated dropout and&#13;
 desertion rates due to the crisis, On the other hand, a large proportion of households&#13;
 report that they have reduced school and learning material purchases. The most serious&#13;
 negative effects of the crisis on the education sector are linked to the fiscal provincial&#13;
 crisis. The lack of financing experienced by several provinces has generated difficulties&#13;
 to comply with payments to their employees, including teachers. Delays in wage&#13;
 payments has had an impact on the continuity of classes. While experiences have&#13;
 differed within the country due in part to the higher or lower solvency in each state, the&#13;
 2002 school year was irreparably affected in some provinces (San Juan, Entre Rios), very&#13;
 seriously affected in others (Tucuman, Jujuy, Rio Negro), and had partial scope in a third&#13;
 group of provinces (Misiones, Formosa, Chubut). The difference among them is the&#13;
 number of school days lost, ranging from about a quarter to almost half of the school&#13;
 year.5&#13;
&#13;
 21.       Many of the social problems have existed before in Argentina. What is different&#13;
is that 2002 has made the social situation even more difficult for the majority of the&#13;
population and the need for action more urgent. Discussions and reform proposals to&#13;
correct the underlying problems have been ongoing for several years without reaching a&#13;
conclusion as a result of insufficient                    political    support and social consensus. The&#13;
Government now faces a particularly difficult challenge: increasing demands for social&#13;
assistance in the context of falling fiscal resources and extremely limited administrative&#13;
capabilities to innovate and coordinate responses.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4 While thereis no updated aggregateofficial datathat would allow to determinethe extent to which therehas beena&#13;
deterioration in infant mortality and malnutrition, evidenceof seriouschild malnutrition (andafailure of existing&#13;
programs to identify thosecasesin time) has emergedrecently in severalprovincesraising the concernthat, if left&#13;
unattended,this could develop into agraverhealth emergency.&#13;
5The interruption of theeducationalprocesshas astrong impact on students'learning processes.Theabandonmentof&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
22.      Nevertheless, recognizing the seriousnessof the social situation, the Government&#13;
has moved decisively to expand key safety net programs, including the Heads of&#13;
Household program, prioritizing       spending on them and consolidating social programs&#13;
around a smaller number of key initiatives.          In addition, the recent creation of the&#13;
National Coordination Council for Social Policies constitutes an important step in the&#13;
direction of improving      the effectiveness of social policies as it allows for better&#13;
coordination    among the various actors at the national level           between different&#13;
jurisdictions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Recent Flooding in Santa Fe Province&#13;
&#13;
23.       The challenges faced by the Province were exacerbated in late April 2003, with&#13;
historical flooding affecting the north and east of Santa Fe, including the capital. Early&#13;
reports, as of May 7, 2003, indicate a death toll of at least 23 persons and evacuees&#13;
housed in official centers at almost 45,000, with un-official reports of perhaps more than&#13;
30,000 that have evacuated themselves to other locations. Two principal hospitals in&#13;
Santa Fe city had been evacuated; there now exists serious difficulties          with waste&#13;
residues in urban areas; as well as high risks for an epidemic and infectious diseases.&#13;
Losses in the agricultural sector-Santa Fe is a major producer and exporter of grains,&#13;
oilseeds, and beef-are     expected to be also substantial with estimates yet to be made.&#13;
There are currently no estimates for damage to infrastructure, but once the water recedes,&#13;
as expected during the next week, significant damage to roads and buildings is likely to&#13;
become visible.&#13;
&#13;
24.       Through Bank-financed operations, Santa Fe has made important investments in&#13;
flood control measure since the major floods of 1992. However, much of this effort had&#13;
been directed at the Parana River, the traditional source of flooding in the Province. The&#13;
current episode, from the River Salado, is without precedent in recorded history.&#13;
National and bi-lateral support has been promised to as part of the relief effort.      The&#13;
Governor has specifically requested Bank support.           Several ongoing Bank-financed&#13;
investment operations, both in social assistance and infrastructure, are likely to also be&#13;
part of these relief and recovery efforts, as well as for flood control activities in the&#13;
future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Part II - Implementation     of the Program and Proposed Restructuring&#13;
&#13;
25.     In support of Santa Fe's reform program, the Board approved in August 2001 a&#13;
US$330 million Provincial Reform Loan. The program was framed within a three-tranche&#13;
design, aimed at reforming and restructuring its government so as to ensure an efficient&#13;
and responsive delivery of public services within fiscally sound policies.         The Loan&#13;
Agreement became effective in September 2001 and the first tranche of US$153.3&#13;
million was disbursed. The proposed amendment would focus on changes to the second&#13;
and third tranches. They take into account the impact of the floating of the Peso and&#13;
associated policy measures, the poor prospects over the medium term for further&#13;
privatization of utilities and the fiscal constraints under which the provinces will need to&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
 operate, particularly as regards spending and reforms in health and education, and to&#13;
 respond to the aggravation of social and political conflicts.   In addition, several targets&#13;
 would be changed to reflect the effects of the historical flooding of the Province in late-&#13;
 April and measuresneeded for relief and recovery.&#13;
&#13;
 FiscalPerformanceand Public SectorReform&#13;
&#13;
 26.     Despite the macroeconomic downturn and resulting fall in revenues, the Province&#13;
 has been able to maintain a fiscal program and has met the second tranche target calling&#13;
 for a balance in current spending (Schedule 3.1). The third tranche condition currently&#13;
 calls for a four percent surplus in current spending. Given the developments at the macro&#13;
 level and the Federal Government's overall target of fiscal balance for the provinces&#13;
 under the Fund program, SantaFe hasagreedto a reformulation of the condition to&#13;
 require that it also achievesa fiscal balance,though not including extraordinary&#13;
 spendingassociatedwith theflood relief and recovery (Schedule4.1).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
27.      Santa Fe has also been able to move towards improved              governance and&#13;
transparency by drafting a new law on financial management and procurement (Schedule&#13;
3.3), which is expected to be approved by the legislature for the third tranche (Schedule&#13;
4.3), and by providing an extensive array of revenue and expenditure data through its web&#13;
site (Schedule 3.4).     It is also actively sharing its social and tax data bases with the&#13;
Federal Government to reduce abuse and sharpen targeting (Schedule 3.8). In public&#13;
investment, it is now requiring economic analysis and environmental             assessment,&#13;
including the application of mitigating measures to all major public works (Schedule 3.5-&#13;
3.6), and spending in road infrastructure is being reoriented toward maintenance&#13;
(Schedule 3.7). Finally, it is pursuing the elimination of distortionary local payroll taxes&#13;
(Schedule 3.9). Many of these actions are expected to be reinforced by the time of the&#13;
third tranche.&#13;
&#13;
28.     Nonetheless, the floating of the Peso has made it impossible for the Province to&#13;
achieve the second and third tranche conditionalities calling for a debt stock target equal&#13;
to 50 percent of revenues. In essence,the floating of the Peso, combined with the Federal&#13;
Government's decision not to assume the foreign exchange risk of on-lent funds from&#13;
multilateral  institutions  (essentially the Bank and the Inter-American      Development&#13;
Bank), has resulted in a tripling of the level of debt in peso terms with these institutions,&#13;
Santa Fe's current debt stock is estimated at the equivalent of 87 percent of total&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             - 12-&#13;
&#13;
 revenues. Assuming that the Peso had remained at one to one to the Dollar, the debt&#13;
 stock ratio would have been 47 percent.       Given these circumstances, it is proposed&#13;
 that the condition for the second tranche (Schedule 3.2) be waived.         For the third&#13;
 tranche, the condition would be amended to prohibit           the incurring of additional&#13;
 debt not directly associated with the flood relief and recovery effort (Schedule 4.2).&#13;
&#13;
 29.     The floating of the Peso has also made unrealistic a number of the originally&#13;
 envisaged spending targets in terms of US Dollar amounts. When the Loan was first&#13;
 negotiated, Santa Fe had proposed a series of expenditure targets in US Dollar terms (at&#13;
 the time, Argentine Law prohibited the setting of goals in terms of real Pesos). With the&#13;
 floating of the Peso, these US Dollar spending levels are no longer within the fiscal&#13;
 possibilities of the Province, as the Peso/US Dollar exchange rate has increased to around&#13;
 3/l, whereas local inflation in 2002 was more in the 40 percent range.&#13;
&#13;
 Infrastructure:   For the second tranche (Schedule 3.5) the Province has agreed to&#13;
 replace the existing amount of US$7.5 million         over which all public investment&#13;
 works would require acceptable economic analysis, as well as environmental         impact&#13;
assessments and mitigating       measures (Schedule 3.6), with Arg$7.5 million.        This&#13;
would potentially strengthen these particular conditions as more public works are likely&#13;
to be above this floor, given the change in relative prices noted above.&#13;
&#13;
Road Maintenance: Second (Schedule 3.7) and third tranche (Schedule 4.4) targets were&#13;
designed to help promote increased spending in routine road maintenance. The US&#13;
Dollar targets of US$15 million        for the second and US$20 million      for the third&#13;
tranche would be changed to Arg$30 million.             This would allow the Province to&#13;
achieve the implicit physical target of maintaining 1,138km of paved roads previously&#13;
agreed for the third tranche. With the recent flooding, it is now likely that even more&#13;
funds would be directed toward road maintenance and rehabilitation,&#13;
&#13;
Social Assistance:     Second (Schedule 3.12) and third tranche (Schedule 4.10) which&#13;
target spending by the Province's Secretariat for Community Promotion at US$50.9&#13;
million,   would now be set in Peso terms.      The Province has agreed to a target of&#13;
Arg$90 million to provide for expanding the coverage of social assistance during the&#13;
current crisis.&#13;
&#13;
Utility Concession&#13;
&#13;
30.      Under the program, Santa Fe had agreed to publicly tender its public electric&#13;
distribution company as a second tranche condition (Schedule 3.10).            Although a&#13;
privatization   law satisfactory to the Bank was approved by the Legislature and&#13;
appropriate bidding documents were prepared by late 2001, a lack of market demand has&#13;
led the Province not to publicly tender the company. With the objective of continuing&#13;
improved service and to pursue a privatization strategy until market conditions improve,&#13;
Santa Fe has agreed as a second tranche condition (Schedule 3.10) to an action plan&#13;
to avoid deterioration     in service and financial   status so that the enterprise itself&#13;
would remain attractive      for concessioning if and when market conditions permit.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             - 13 -&#13;
&#13;
 The action plan specifically calls for increasing the autonomy of the company through&#13;
 corporatization, the development of a performance contract, and the creation of a&#13;
 regulatory    entity for   monitoring     of  the   performance     contract.      Satisfactory&#13;
 implementation     of the action plan would be a new condition of the third tranche&#13;
 (Schedule 4.7). A condition related to the use of privatization            receipts would be&#13;
 dropped as no longer relevant (Schedule 4.8). It is proposed that this condition be&#13;
 waived.&#13;
&#13;
 Social Assistance&#13;
&#13;
 31.      In responseto the social crisis, Santa Fe is shifting the focus of its efforts in social&#13;
 assistance and has agreed to a reformulation of the third tranche conditions. While the&#13;
 provincial social assistance program (Programa Provincial de Ayuda Social Solidaria&#13;
 Santa Fe) remains at the core of its efforts, and indeed is serving as a model for newer&#13;
 federal level program, with the social crisis important resources have been channeled into&#13;
 the Province's Emergency Feeding Program (Programa de Emergencia Alimentaria), and&#13;
 more is to be expected to support the flood relief effort now underway. The Province had&#13;
 agreed under the second tranche (Schedule 3.13) to evaluate at least two of its ongoing&#13;
 social assistance programs and to then prepare action plans for these programs for the&#13;
third tranche (Schedule 4.11). While it has completed these evaluations for its provincial&#13;
 social assistance program and for elderly care (Programas de Tercer Edad), it would&#13;
replace the latter with an evaluation and action plan for the increasingly important&#13;
Emergency Feeding Program. Finally, an additional             third tranche condition would&#13;
have required that the Province's beneficiary registry to include all beneficiaries of&#13;
the programs evaluated under the second tranche (Schedule 4.12). Given the shift&#13;
in priorities, the Province would like for this condition to be reformulated            to apply&#13;
only to the provincial    social assistance solidarity program and not the program for&#13;
elderly care. While it would work to also include beneficiaries of the emergency feeding&#13;
program in the registry, given the continuing expansion of the program it cannot commit&#13;
at this time to a specific target.&#13;

32.      The program to support reforms in education to enhance quality and increase&#13;
efficiency and equity remains solidly on track and full compliance is expected for both&#13;
the second and third tranches.           Accomplishments       to date include:       the initial&#13;
implementation of computerized human resource management systems for teachers and&#13;
student; the proactive use of national student achievement tests to improve performance&#13;
at the school level; the rationalization of surplus teacher training institutes and the&#13;
implementation of an accrediting system to enhance quality; and the design of a system to&#13;
allocate public subsidies to private schools based on the number of students, quality, and&#13;
equity.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              - 14 -&#13;
&#13;
 Health&#13;
&#13;
 33.      Likewise, the program in health reform is expected to be fully implemented.&#13;
 Achievements to date include: the launching of a primary care program for the uninsured&#13;
 poor focusing on maternal and child care services, and those related to chronic diseases,&#13;
 where a successful pilot is being expanded into other areas with high levels of poverty; a&#13;
 program to enhance the performance of public hospitals through performance contracts to&#13;
 ensure quality and increase cost recovery; and strengthening of the financial performance&#13;
 of the HMO for public employees. At the same time, given the urgent needs to respond&#13;
 to the flooding situation, in particular as regards emergency public health services, Santa&#13;
 Fe has agreed to lower the third tranche target for incorporating       additional people&#13;
 in its primary     care program    for the uninsured poor (Schedule 4.21).        While the&#13;
 Province remains committed to this program and fully expects to meet this target during&#13;
 the year, some delays in implementation are likely to occur given the current health&#13;
 emergency in Santa Fe; it is therefore proposed to lower the target from 150,000 to&#13;
 100,000. Those not formally enrolled in this program would still have accessto public&#13;
 health services.&#13;
&#13;
 Other modifications.&#13;
&#13;
 34.     Apart from the restructuring, it is also proposed to extend the closing date and to&#13;
 lift the original requirement of a minimum time period between the release of second and&#13;
 third tranches. This restriction was initially included to help ensure that the institutional&#13;
 reforms being pursued had sufficient time in place to promote sustainability.         At this&#13;
 stage, these new systems have largely been in place for almost one year and the previous&#13;
limitations    are no longer warranted and might constitute an undue burden on the&#13;
Province. It is proposed that the closing date of the Project be extended to December&#13;
31,2003, and the limitation     on release of the Third Tranche (Section 2.02 (e)) of six&#13;
months after the Second Tranche be dropped.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                               Part III - Benefits and Risks&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
35.      The main benefit would be in maintaining and advancing reforms in public&#13;
finances, public administration, as well as in the social sectors, where 90 percent of&#13;
health and basic education are the responsibility of the Santa Fe government. It would&#13;
support the government's efforts to adapt to the changed macro-economic circumstances&#13;
and continue to improve the provision of social and infrastructure services, and meet the&#13;
pressing needs from the devastating floods. Moreover, the reforms under implementation&#13;
in the social sectors represent important steps toward strengthening the efficiency and&#13;
effectiveness of government interventions in those areas at a crucial time. Beyond Santa&#13;
Fe, this program will contribute to consolidate the incipient economic recovery and&#13;
enhance the conditions for the continuation of a longer-term reform program in&#13;
Argentina.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                           - 15 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
36.     There are several substantial risks.    Even with the proposed amendment the&#13;
Province may fail to meet its reform goals, becauseof either a weakening in commitment&#13;
or a further deterioration in the macroeconomic and social environment. A related risk is&#13;
that, while a provincial government is able to meet its reform commitments, the Federal&#13;
Government may fail        to maintain    a satisfactory macroeconomic    framework      or&#13;
subsequently deviate from an agreedprogram. Third, uncertainties related to fiscal effect&#13;
and economic costs of the floods, and the upcoming change in the national administration&#13;
may pose a risk to the implementation of the program, Beyond these risks, a continued&#13;
economic slow down, including the impact of the general world economy, would also&#13;
present serious risks to the fragile macroeconomic situation. Mitigating these risks is the&#13;
commitment by the provinces including Santa Fe to reduce the overall provincial deficit&#13;
and produce sustained primary surpluses. The much better than anticipated performance&#13;
in 2002 by the provinces and their commitment to implement the 2003 targets are hopeful&#13;
signs that they will carry out the 2003 agreements.&#13;

&#13;
 Dear Mr. Wolfensohn:&#13;
&#13;

 environmentin Argentinaafter abandonmentof convertibility in January2002,while ensuring&#13;
 the permanenceandrelevanceof the objectivesthe program. Specifically, the changesin the&#13;
 fiscal, debt,andinvestmentconditionsandthe strongresurgenceof socialconflict have&#13;
 substantiallymodified thepriorities andconditionsprevailing at thetime this Loan was&#13;
 approved.Moreover, therecentunprecedentedflooding in SantaFe of the SaladoRiver has&#13;
 destroyedinfrastructure,buildings, vehiclesandlives, andwill requireconsiderableeffortsfor&#13;
 relief andrecovery.&#13;
&#13;
 2.       At the sametime, we havebeenadaptingour priorities within the contextof the overall&#13;
reform objectives,to dealwith thesocialandeconomicemergency,andthe abovemention&#13;
naturaldisaster. The changesin our programremainfirmly groundedin theoverall objectives&#13;
to achievefiscal stability andpromote structuralreforms to improvethe efficiency, quality and&#13;
equity of public spending,particularly in the socialsectors.&#13;
&#13;
Fiscal Performance and Public Sector Reform&#13;
&#13;
3.       Although themacroeconomicdownturnandreductionin revenueshavebeenachallenge,&#13;
we havebeenableto maintaina solidfiscal program. For the third tranchewe would be&#13;
strengtheningour commitment by agreeingto achievefiscal equilibrium, exceptfor the&#13;
extraordinaryspendingrequiredfor flood relief andrecovery.&#13;
&#13;
4.       For thepublic sectorwe areimproving governanceandtransparencywith a new law on&#13;
financial managementandprocurement,which would beexpectedto beapprovedby the&#13;
legislaturefor the third tranche. We havealsomadeavailablethroughour web site a variety of&#13;
revenueandexpendituredata. We arealsocoordinatingour efforts with the Federalgovernment&#13;
andproviding themwith our socialanddatainformation in orderto detectfraud andincrease&#13;
revenues.The Provinceit is now requiring economicanalysisandenvironmentalassessment,&#13;
including environmentalmeasuresfor important public works, andwe areincreasingspendingon&#13;
roadmaintenance. We arealso eliminating the local payroll tax.&#13;
&#13;
5.       Unfortunately, thefloating of thepesohashada negativeimpact on the Province'sability&#13;
to achievethepreviously agreeddebt stocktargetequalto 50 percentof revenues.As theFederal&#13;
governmentis not assumingthe foreign exchangerisk of on-lent fundsfrom the Bank andthe&#13;
Inter-American DevelopmentBank, our debtwith themastripled in Pesoterms. Currently,debt&#13;

&#13;
 aswasthe caseat asof January2002,the sameratio would havebeen47 percent). We askthat&#13;
 the secondtranchecondition be waived. For thethird tranche,we would commit to not incurring&#13;
 anyadditionaldebt,exceptasrequiredfor debtrestructuringor for financing to supportfor flood&#13;
 relief andrecoveryefforts.&#13;

&#13;
 7.      We haveattemptedto concessionour public electricdistribution company,anda&#13;
 privatization law was approvedby the Legislatureandbidding documentswerepreparedby late&#13;
 2001. However,a lack of marketdemandhasled us not to tenderthecompany. As a meansof&#13;
 continuingto pursuea privatization strategyuntil marketconditionsimprove, we would agreeas&#13;
 a secondtranchecondition to an actionplan to avoid deteriorationin serviceandfinancial status&#13;
 sothatthe enterpriseitself would remainattractivefor concessioning,if andwhen market&#13;
 conditionspermit. The actionplan requiresincreasedautonomyof the companythrough&#13;
 corporatization,a performancecontract,anda regulatoryagencyfor monitoring of the&#13;
 performancecontract.&#13;
&#13;
 SocialAssistance&#13;
&#13;
 8.      In responseto the socialcrisis, SantaFeis shifting thefocus of its efforts in social&#13;
 assistanceandhasagreedto a reformulation of thethird trancheconditions. While the provincial&#13;
 socialassistanceprogram(ProgramaProvincial deAyuda SocialSolidariaSantaFe) remainsa&#13;
key programfor us,important resourcesarenow beingchanneledinto the Province'sEmergency&#13;
FeedingProgram(ProgramadeEmergenciaAlimentaria). We havenow agreedto prepare&#13;
actionsplansfor theseprogramsfor the third tranche.While we havecompletedthese&#13;
evaluationsfor its provincial socialassistanceprogramandfor elderly care(ProgramasdeTercer&#13;
Edad),we would replacethe latter with anevaluationandactionplan for the increasingly&#13;
importantEmergencyFeedingProgram.&#13;
&#13;
Education&#13;
&#13;
9.       Our efforts at reform in educationto enhancequality andincreaseefficiency andequity&#13;
remainon track. We havebeenableto initiate theimplementationof computerizedhuman&#13;

andthe designof a systemto allocatepublic subsidisesto private schoolsbasedon the numberof&#13;

&#13;
Health&#13;
&#13;
10.      Our efforts in healthreform arealsogoing well. We havebeenableto launch a primary&#13;
careprogramfor theuninsuredpoor focusing on maternalandchild careservices,and those&#13;
relatedto chronic diseases.A successfulpilot is beingexpandedinto otherareaswith high levels&#13;

&#13;
financial performanceof the HMO for public employees. In light of therecentflooding andthe&#13;
new andurgentdemandson the healthsector,theProvincewould like to slightly reducethe target&#13;
for the programto cover thepoor anduninsuredwith primary care,from 150,000to 100,000.We&#13;
remaincommittedto this program,andmanyof thesesamepeoplewould benefitfrom the flood&#13;
relief effort, reducingthis targetwould facilitate our ability to meetoverall third tranche&#13;
conditions andprovide us with the furtherfinancing requiredto meetthe challengeof rebuilding&#13;

Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
12.      Thechangeswe aremaking would takeinto accountthemajor changesin the&#13;
macroeconomic,investmentandsocialenvironment,following the floating of thePesoand&#13;
associatedFederalpolicy measuresin January2002,that occurredsubsequentto the initiation of&#13;
the reform programsagreedwith theBank. While the overall programobjectivesremainvalid&#13;
andfeasible,theserecentevents,beyondthecontrol of the Province,haverendereda limited&#13;
numberof specificconditionalitiesunattainablein themedium term asoriginally framed. In&#13;
addition, severalfurther modificationswould facilitate the Provincein meetingthechallengesof&#13;
therecentflooding andthe needsfor relief, recoveryandrebuilding of SantaFe. The proposed&#13;
amendmentremainsfirmly groundedin the overall objectivesof the program,aspreviously&#13;
approvedby the Board, to achievefiscal stability at the provincial level andpromotestructural&#13;
reforms to improve theefficiency, quality andequity of public spending,particularly in the social&#13;

            Argentina - Santa Fe Provincial Reform
            Adjustment Loan : Proposed Amendment and Waivers and
            Tranche Release
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Santa Fe Provincial Reform
            Adjustment Loan (Ln 4634-AR) for US$330 million was approved
            by the Board in August 2001 and became effective in
            September 2001. The loan comprises three tranches, payable
            at the Bank's standard interest rate for LIBOR-based
            dollar loan, with a grace period of 5 years, a final
            maturity in 15 years, and a level repayment of principal.
            The first tranche in the amount of US$153.3 million was
            released on September 20, 2001. The accompanying Tranche
            Release Document for the second tranche of US$50 million
            sets forth the description of tranche conditions, status of
            compliance of the Borrower, and proposed amendment/waivers
            to both the second and third tranches. The Loan is designed
            to support the implementation of a program by the Borrower
            Santa Fe Province aimed at reforming its government so as to
            ensure an efficient and responsive delivery of public
            services within fiscally sound policies. While the Province
            has largely been able to successfully implement the program,
            due to the impact of the severe macroeconomic developments
            in Argentina and the resulting deterioration in social
            conditions, the Loan is being reformulated in terms of
            waivers/amendments to individual conditions. In keeping with
            the original development objective, the reformulated loan
            would continue to support the Province of Santa Fe's
            reform efforts to achieve fiscal stability at the provincial
            level and promote structural reforms to improve the
            efficiency, quality and equity of public spending,
            particularly in the social sectors.      This Supplemental
            Credit will be used to return the investment program for the
            Road Maintenance Project for Albania to its original size,
            improving about 1,000 km of the national road network and
            about 1,000 km o f the rural road network. No changes to the
            originally negotiated Credit are proposed. The Project is
            expected to be completed by the original Closing Date.
