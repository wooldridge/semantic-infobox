A REVOLUTION IN CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT?&#13;
AFRICANS ASK TOUGH QUESTIONS&#13;
By Bathylle Missika-Wierzba, OECD, and Mark Nelson, World Bank Institute&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         In the past year, the donor community has paid unprecedented attention to the subject of capac-&#13;
      ity development. From the World Bank Task Force on Capacity Development in Africa to the Paris&#13;
      Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, donors have signaled both the importance of the issue to African&#13;
      development and a new determination to improve results on capacity development interventions. For&#13;
      African practitioners, however, whether this new attention will result in real changes is still unclear.&#13;
      This brief examines some of the African reactions, gathered through a series of consultations in the&#13;
      past year, to growing attention on capacity development among donors. Unless the new commitments&#13;
      lead to real changes in behavior on the ground, the African practitioners say, the latest commitments&#13;
      will simply be remembered as yet another missed turning point.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
  The signing of the Paris Declaration on Aid&#13;
Effectiveness1 in March 2005 appeared to mark a                 Box 1: Call for CD Reform Is Nothing New&#13;
new day in progress on capacity development. The&#13;
agreement, which established a set of concrete com-                As early as 1968, the DAC observed that "assessments&#13;
mitments and areas that donors and partner countries            already made invariably stress the need for better coordina-&#13;

country capacity. Most of the other indicators focus on         donor agencies' daily operations, especially at field level.&#13;
                                                                Another plea for change recently came from OECD-DAC's&#13;
improved donor coordination under country leader-               The Challenge of Capacity Development: Working Towards&#13;

countries. This agreement--unprecedented in scope,              donors to change behavior and places more emphasis on&#13;
                                                                capacity development.&#13;
specificity, and backing by donors and partners--rede-&#13;
fined the conditions of the development partnership&#13;
and opened a window of opportunity.&#13;
&#13;
  For many African development practitioners, how-&#13;
ever, these commitments sounded a bit too familiar.           1 In this international agreement, more than 100 ministers,&#13;

&amp;#12;     Box 2: The Consultations&#13;
&#13;
       Two sets of consultations with countries in Sub-Saharan Africa were held, both using the Global Development Learning&#13;
     Network, a network of satellite-linked videoconferencing studios. Country teams met for half a day to read position papers, dis-&#13;
     cuss their relevance to participants' countries, and debate positions. Later in the day, the groups were connected to five or six&#13;
     other country groups by satellite to share notes and compare opinions.&#13;
&#13;
       The first consultations took place in September 2005 as part of the preparation of Building Effective States--Forging Engaged&#13;
     Societies (World Bank 2005). An anglophone segment linked participants at sites in Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, and&#13;
     Tanzania and also included participants from Botswana, Namibia, and Zimbabwe. The francophone segment linked Burkina Faso,&#13;
     Madagascar, Rwanda, and Senegal and also included participants from Mauritius.&#13;
&#13;
        The second set of consultations in March 2006, jointly organized by the DAC secretariat and World Bank Institute, followed&#13;
     publication of The Challenge of Capacity Development: Working Towards Good Practice (OECD 2006c) and involved participants&#13;
     in Benin, Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Mauritania, Senegal, Ghana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda.&#13;

are now receiving even greater attention as donors                       said a participant from the Ivory Coast. This entails "a&#13;

changes in behavior come from donors, however, they                      they said. It is important to "give voice to the voice-&#13;

            A revolution in capacity development?
            Africans ask tough questions
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            In the past year, the donor community
            has paid unprecedented attention to the subject of capacity
            development. From the World Bank task force on capacity
            development in Africa to the Paris Declaration on aid
            effectiveness, donors have signaled both the importance of
            the issue to African development and a new determination to
            improve results on capacity development interventions. For
            African practitioners, however, whether this new attention
            will result in real changes is still unclear. This brief
            examines some of the African reactions, gathered through a
            series of consultations in the past year, to growing
            attention on capacity development among donors. Unless the
            new commitments lead to real changes in behavior on the
            ground, the African practitioners say, the latest
            commitments will simply be remembered as yet another missed
            turning point.
