1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   The Governnent of China has requested the International Development&#13;
Association (IDA) to assist in financing a poverty alleviation project in Shanxi Province.&#13;
The proposed project would raise incomes and living standards in some of the poorest&#13;
counties of one of China's less prosperous provinces. This would be achieved by&#13;
improvements to irrigation systems, land development, expansion of household livestock&#13;
and horticulture, and modernization of agricultural processing. The project was prepared&#13;
by the Yuncheng and Luliang prefectures under the direction of the Shanxi Provincial&#13;
Planning Commission with assistance from the Food and Agriculture Organization. The&#13;
project was preappraised in March 1995 and appraised in June 1995.&#13;
B. RURAL POVERTY IN CHINA&#13;
1.2   China's economic reforms, begun in 1978, sharply reduced poverty in the period&#13;
1978-85. In 1978, 270 million (one third of the population) lived below the absolute&#13;
poverty line compared to 100 million (one tenth of the population) in 1985. But, since&#13;
1985 there has only been a small decline in the incidence of absolute poverty. This is&#13;
because gains in farn incomes have come mainly in areas with favorable natural&#13;
resources, where farmers could benefit from market-oriented reforms. Gains in poverty&#13;
alleviation have been harder to make in remote mountainous areas, where the area of&#13;
farmland per family is small and irrigation potential is limited. In these areas, per capita&#13;
output of grain and subsistence foods failed to show any significant increase in the 1980s,&#13;
and rural enterprises employ only 4 percent of the rural labor force in the poorest counties&#13;
in contrast to the 22 percent national average. China's poverty reduction strategy is now&#13;
focused on raising living standards and incomes in the poorer areas through investments&#13;
in land development, rural works, and rural enterprises.&#13;
1.3   The Government's first poverty-focused program was initiated in 1986, when 18&#13;
priority areas throughout China, including two in Shanxi Province, were targeted for&#13;
assistance. Recognizing the necessity for a stepped-up redirected effort, in 1993 the State&#13;
Council endorsed a new program to focus on the poorest counties throughout China.&#13;
Called the "Eight-Seven Poverty Alleviation Plan (8-7 Plan)", its objective is to raise the&#13;
estimated 80 million people in absolute poverty to above the poverty line by the end of&#13;
the century. Counties included in the plan had incomes below Y 400 per head (1992&#13;
prices), or incomes below Y 700 per head despite involvement in the previous poverty&#13;
program. The 592 nationally designated poor counties include over 70 percent of the 80&#13;
million poor. The budget for the prograrn is about Y 4 billion per year, of which 70-80&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
percent is provided by the central government, 10 percent by local governments and&#13;
10-20 percent by intemational donor agencies.&#13;
1.4   Shanxi Province, one of the poorest provinces in China, has 118 counties, of&#13;
which 50 have been identified as poverty stricken. Thirty-five of these counties were&#13;
identified by the national poverty alleviation program and 15 classified by the province.&#13;
The total population of the 50 counties is 8.4 million, of whom 7.5 million are rural.&#13;
Average rural per capita income in 1993, which was a good year for agriculture, was&#13;
Y 509 per head, about 29 percent less than the Y 718 average rural income for the&#13;
province and just over half the national average rural per capita income of Y 921. Within&#13;
the 50 counties, some 492 townships with a population of 3.8 million have been classified&#13;
as areas of absolute poverty with incomes of below Y 400 per head.&#13;
1.5   The poverty alleviation strategy of the Shanxi Government aims to raise&#13;
cultivable land from the present 1.3 mu (0.09 ha) per head to 2 mu (0.13 ha) per head, to&#13;
develop agroindustries. to improve rural infrastructure, and to encourage integrated&#13;
development of orchards, forests and ruminant livestock.&#13;
1.6   Since 1985, a program to increase the high-quality cultivated land area through&#13;
comprehensive rehabilitation of small watersheds, including terracing of slope lands, has&#13;
been pursued in Shanxi. The program is an important means of tackling poverty through&#13;
the development of unused land in poor areas. Over the next five years, the plan is to&#13;
terrace around 293,000 ha of land in the 50 poor counties.&#13;
1.7   To encourage land development, the Province published a regulation in 1994 that&#13;
sets out arrangements to extend the period for which land can be contracted to farn&#13;
households. Normal land contracts, previously maximum of 15 years, are now extended&#13;
to 30 years, except in poverty and marginal areas where they are for 50 years. In areas of&#13;
uncultivated slopes, gullies and river beach land, the tenure can be extended to 100 years.&#13;
1.8   These new regulations aim to encourage farmers to practice sound soil and water&#13;
conservation measures. As a further incentive, farmers on uncultivated slopes and gullies&#13;
will be exempted from payment of agricultural taxes for the first 10 years of occupancy.&#13;
The method of land allocation would be by auction among farmers in nearby villages. In&#13;
order to protect the interests of poorer families in the community, payment for the land&#13;
can be by installments over a period of years. The main objective of the auction system is&#13;
to give farmers security in the use of their land, provided their farming practices meet the&#13;
standards laid down for land management by the province.&#13;
1.9   Poverty alleviation activities in the province are coordinated by the Shanxi&#13;
Poverty Alleviation Office. Two nongovernmental organizations, the Laucu Promotion&#13;
Association and the Shanxi Poverty Alleviation Association, are also active in the&#13;
province.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

1.10  The following ongoing programs for poverty alleviation in the poverty (and&#13;
proposed project) areas, Luliang and Yuncheng prefectures, are currently being supported&#13;
by IDA and other international organizations:&#13;
(a)   Education Development in Poor Provinces Project (Cr. 2336-CHA,&#13;
FY92). The project covers Shanxi and five other provinces. In Luliang&#13;
the project counties are Linxian, Xinxian, Lishi, Zhongyang, Lanxian,&#13;
Fangshan and Shilou. The project objectives are: (i) to improve the&#13;
efficiency and quality of primary and lower secondary school education&#13;
and support the establishment of a nine-year compulsory education&#13;
system; and (ii) to support the development and restructuring of higher&#13;
level education and the efficient use of resources by colleges and&#13;
universities and improve provincial and county-level education planning.&#13;
(b)   Rural Health Workers Development Project (Cr. 2539-CHA, FY94).&#13;
This project covers six provinces and includes Yuncheng and Luliang&#13;
among the six prefectures in Shanxi Province. It provides for medical&#13;
colleges, township hospitals and training centers.&#13;
(c)   Forest Resource Development and Protection Project (Cr. 2623,&#13;
FY94). The project is designed to enhance the productivity of forest&#13;
resources, the efficiency of resource use, and the institutional capacity for&#13;
sustainable management in 16 provinces of China including 15 counties in&#13;
Shanxi Province. Pinglu county in Yuncheng is covered by the project.&#13;
(d)   China-3923 Project (World Food Programme, 1992-97). The project&#13;
aims to increase farmers' incomes and improve their living conditions&#13;
through a comprehensive program of soil and water conservation in Lishi,&#13;
Linxian and Zhongyang counties of Luliang Prefecture. The project&#13;
covers an area of 1,846 square kilometers in 568 administrative villages&#13;
under 31 townships and will benefit 248,000 farmers.&#13;
1.11  Local Programs. In Luliang, an "Experimental Special Zone Implementation&#13;
Plan for Poverty Alleviation Development" has been formulated based on the outlines&#13;
provided by the provincial government.  The prefecture has also prepared a&#13;
comprehensive program for poverty alleviation known as the "Eight-Seven Poverty&#13;
Program" consisting of: (a) farmland and water conservancy construction; (b) pasture&#13;
and livestock development with emphasis on runinants; (c) creation of four fruit&#13;
production bases; (d) construction of roads and highways; (e) water supply for rural&#13;
residents and livestock; and (f) training.&#13;
1.12 Chen Poverty Alleviation Program. This is a new Chinese program which&#13;
draws funding from wealthier areas and provides credit for poverty alleviation projects.&#13;
The program involves the nine poorest provinces and autonomous regions. Luliang&#13;
Prefecture is being used as the pilot area for this project in Shanxi. The four aims of this&#13;
program include: (a) elimination of illiteracy; (b) technical and occupational training;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
(c) health and hygiene education; and (d) reduction of the school dropout rate for older&#13;
children. The All China Women's Federation (ACWF) is one of the lead agencies for&#13;
project implementation.  Training and education provided under the program  will&#13;
complement projects that focus on economic development.&#13;
1.13  All China Women's Federation.   The ACWF, through local women's&#13;
federations, is active at the county level throughout China.  Its main focus is on&#13;
improving the status of women in the home and the workplace. As a nongovernmental&#13;
organization, it involves women in local or national issues. It can also assist in the&#13;
dissemination of information to grass root levels. In Luliang Prefecture, the ACWF has&#13;
been active within the WFP 3923 Project. Their trainers have helped to organize and&#13;
deliver technical training in health education, child care and adult literacy courses for&#13;
women in the project villages. Also, with financing from the Agricultural Bank of China&#13;
and the Chen Poverty Alleviation Project, the ACWF has organized female trainers in&#13;
groups of three or four to provide technical training (6,800 women have participated to&#13;
date) in livestock, greenhouses, cotton, and fruit trees.&#13;
1.14  Project Hope. This is a nationwide educational program for school dropouts in&#13;
poor areas. It helps to finance the cost of building and operating schools, school&#13;
textbooks, and provides a source of financing for adult education.&#13;
i.15  Green Certificate Training Project. This national project was initiated in 1990&#13;
to promote training of farmers to apply modern scientific and technological methods. To&#13;
date, the project has been extended to 516 (25 percent) of the counties in China. There&#13;
have been 600,000 trainees of which 120,000 have obtained Green Certificates (two years&#13;
of theory and practical study). The education program includes tree planting, fisheries,&#13;
animal husbandry, agricultural machinery, rural enterprises and environmental protection.&#13;
Certificate holders are given preference for land contracts, loans, technical instruction,&#13;
and extension services. The target is to train 10 million farmers by the year 2000-one&#13;
farmer for every 20 rural households.  This project was introduced to Yuncheng&#13;
Prefecture in 1994, which includes a pilot programn in Wanrong County and Yuncheng&#13;
City. The work is being implemented by the Agricultural Broadcasting School. As of&#13;
March 1995, about 2,000 trainees were participating in the program.&#13;
C. PROJECT RATIONALE&#13;
1.16 The proposed project would complement the ongoing activities described above,&#13;
and support the Government's policy to reduce the imbalance in economic development&#13;
between the increasingly prosperous eastern provinces and the poorer central and western&#13;
regions. Not only is Shanxi poor relative to other provinces, but some poor, remote and&#13;
backward rural areas have much lower living standards than industrial areas within the&#13;
province.&#13;
1.17  Some of the reasons for poverty are to be found in the climate, the small farm&#13;
size, the difficulties in farming the steep slopes and easily erodible loess soils, inadequate&#13;
irrigation and relative isolation in terms of new technology and markets. Poor farmers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
have limited access to credit and lack the funds to make the investments needed to&#13;
improve the situation. Nor has the land tenure system in the past provided sufficient&#13;
incentives and security for farmers to engage in land improvement activities that&#13;
generally make heavy demands on their labor and pay back only in the medium or long&#13;
term.&#13;
1.18  These factors are addressed by the Province's poverty alleviation plan and by the&#13;
proposed project's support for the plan. Terracing and improvement in irrigation are&#13;
likely to increase agricultural production and hence raise subsistence levels or increase&#13;
cash income. A better supply of drinking water saves time that can be more productively&#13;
used, reduces water-borne diseases, and tends to benefit the poorer and remote villages.&#13;
Rural roads in remote areas improve market access and encourage farmers to grow cash&#13;
crops. Livestock offers ways to raise farm incomes in many villages, provided the&#13;
farmers can be given financial assistance to buy animals. Crop residues, and communal&#13;
and individual grazing on better managed natural and improved pasture could support&#13;
more animals than at present.&#13;
1.19  Improvement of the irrigation system in the proposed project area-Yuncheng&#13;
Prefecture-will have a major impact on poverty alleviation. At present, because of&#13;
small farm sizes and unreliable irrigation, farm families live in considerable insecurity.&#13;
Even if a family manages to escape poverty in one year, it often returns to poverty the&#13;
next.  The project would also have significant environmental benefits, since past&#13;
problems in diverting water from the Yellow River have led to sinking of large numbers&#13;
of tubewells and overexploitation of the aquifer. The irrigation system to be constructed&#13;
under the project would help to replenish the groundwater resource.&#13;
1.20  There will be no investment in social services such as education or health because&#13;
these sectors are covered by existing programs; however, an indirect benefit is anticipated&#13;
because higher incomes can lead to a marked improvement in living standards, housing,&#13;
nutrition, health care and education. In this manner, the project should help to alleviate&#13;
poverty by directly raising incomes and improving living standards, and by indirectly&#13;
benefiting social services which have been targeted by other programs. Therefore, instead&#13;
of a fully integrated project targeted at specific villages, this project aims to augment an&#13;
existing programs for poverty alleviation that has identified subprojects that can greatly&#13;
benefit a large number of poor people.&#13;
D. LESSONS FROM PREvious BANK GROUP OPERATIONS&#13;
1.21   The Bank Group has helped to finance numerous projects designed to raise living&#13;
standards and incomes and reduce poverty in the rural areas of China. Overall, these&#13;
projects have been implemented efficiently, time and cost overruns have been moderate,&#13;
despite periods of sharp price escalation, and rates of return have generally equaled or&#13;
exceeded appraisal estimates.  A notable feature of these projects has been the&#13;
involvement of local communities in their planning, design, and implementation. The&#13;
agricultural and water conservancy bureaus of the counties and townships have played a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
leading role in the projects, under the overall supervision of the provinces, and several&#13;
projects, such as the Red Soils I and II Projects, the Gansu Agricultural Development&#13;
Project, and the Loess Plateau Project, carried out in relatively resource-poor areas are or&#13;
have been notably successful.&#13;
1.22  Worldwide, the lessons derived from a recent review by the Bank's Operations&#13;
Evaluation Department of nearly 300 projects of similar nature point to the importance&#13;
of: (a) concentrating on geographical areas where the poor live, products and services the&#13;
poor produce and consume, and assets the poor hold; (b) commitment to and ownership&#13;
of the project objectives and components by the people directly affected, which in turn&#13;
requires active beneficiary participation during planning and design of the components;&#13;
(c) an enabling policy environment providing sufficient incentives for the farmners to&#13;
respond to the opportunities offered by the project; (d) flexibility to react to unforeseen or&#13;
unforeseeable events by adopting a process approach for components with higher risk;&#13;
and (e) design simplicity and replicability.  These lessons have been explicitly&#13;
incorporated into the design of the individual components of the project. Careful&#13;
selection of the project areas and targeting of beneficiaries, active participation of&#13;
shareholders throughout the design phase, focus on the policy environment through&#13;
guaranteed long-term land contracts, flexibility and process approach in components with&#13;
higher risk, such as livestock, and design simplicity where appropriate, for exarnple,&#13;
horticulture and watershed rehabilitation, were integral parts of project preparation.&#13;
1.23  To succeed, past experience clearly indicates that poverty alleviation projects need&#13;
strong government commitment, broad based beneficiary participation, incentives for the&#13;
rural poor to complement project investments with their own efforts, a capable institution&#13;
to implement the program, and proven technologies backed by functioning support&#13;
services. These are present in the project areas.&#13;
E. RATIONALE FOR BANK GROUP INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.24  The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy being presented&#13;
today. Under this strategy two of the Bank Group's operational priorities in China are&#13;
poverty alleviation and environmental enhancement and protection. The Bank's 1992&#13;
report: "China: Strategies for Reducing Poverty in the 1990s" and the subsequent&#13;
International Conference on Poverty Issues in China held in Beijing in November 1992,&#13;
led to a substantial level of agreement between the Chinese authorities and the Bank on&#13;
the nature of the poverty problem and approaches to its alleviation. The project design&#13;
reflects those approaches and the strategy of the Government's "8-7 Plan" by addressing&#13;
two of the key challenges facing rural development in China-slow income growth and&#13;
limited entrepreneurial development as well as the need for greater government&#13;
investrnent in rural areas. The project attacks poverty at its core and will improve the&#13;
lives of many of the rural poor in the project areas.&#13;

2. THE PROJECT AREAS&#13;
A. LOCATION&#13;
2.1   Shanxi covers 156,000 km2 along the east bank of the Yellow River and has a&#13;
population of 30.3 million. Agriculture in Shanxi in 1993 accounted for about 15 percent&#13;
of the province's gross product compared to 57 percent from industry and construction&#13;
(particularly coal mining and mineral processing) and 28 percent from other sectors&#13;
(transportation, commerce, communication and service industries).  Agriculture has&#13;
declined over time as the industrial and other sectors have developed, but the sector&#13;
continues to employ almost half of Shanxi's labor force and provides the bulk of its food&#13;
requirements. About 3.7 million ha, or 23 percent, of Shanxi's 15.6 million ha total land&#13;
area is cultivated. Of this, about 1.2 million ha, or 32 percent, have some forn of&#13;
irrigation. The main crops grown are wheat (about one million ha), maize (0.65 million&#13;
ha), millet (0.35 million ha), oil crops (0.34 million ha), soybean (0.28 million ha) and&#13;
cotton (0.09 million ha). The area devoted to orchards, notably apples, Chinese dates and&#13;
pears, has expanded quite rapidly in recent years to around 0.24 million ha, mostly&#13;
interplanted with grain. The mountains and hilly areas contain some good forest stands,&#13;
and the area of forest of 2.6 million ha takes up 17 percent of Shanxi's land area.&#13;
Livestock in Shanxi consists of around 2 million head of cattle, 7 million sheep and&#13;
goats, and 4 million pigs.&#13;
2.2   Shanxi Province comprises 12 prefectures with 32,000 villages under 1,510&#13;
townships in 118 counties. More than 80 percent of the province is located in hilly and&#13;
mountainous terrain on the Loess Plateau. Rural per capita incomes are 80 percent of the&#13;
national average. Poverty in rural areas is acute. While in 1985 only 35 counties in the&#13;
province were recognized as poor counties, this number has now risen to 50. The project&#13;
prefectures of Luliang and Yuncheng are the two poorest prefectures in Shanxi with an&#13;
annual rural per capita income of only 75 percent of the provincial average. They cover&#13;
2&#13;
25,000 km., 16 percent of Shanxi's land area.&#13;
B. YUNCHENG PREFECTURE&#13;
2.3   Geographic Location. Yuncheng Prefecture lies in the southern tip of Shanxi&#13;
Province, and is bounded to the west and south by the Yellow River and to the north by&#13;
the Fen River. Altitudes range from 180 to 2,300 meters, with mountainous areas along&#13;
the northeast part of the project area. About 70 percent of the area has loess soils, with&#13;
the remainder being alluvial soils along the river valley and in the floodplain. Erosion is&#13;
less of a problem than in the Luliang area and is mainly concentrated in the loess terraces&#13;
bounding the Yellow and Fen Rivers. Yuncheng has a monsoon continental climate.&#13;
Annual precipitation averages 530 mm, mostly in the form of rain in the months of May&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
to September. Average monthly temperatures can exceed 300C in the summer and can&#13;
fall as low as -50C in the winter. The frost-free period is between 185 and 235 days.&#13;
2.4   Population Characteristics. The 13 project counties cover an area of 14,000&#13;
km  and have a population of 4.4 million (1.1 million households), of which 3.8 million&#13;
(88 percent) hold a rural registration. Migration in and out of the prefecture is quite&#13;
small, representing about one percent of the total population annually. Immigration&#13;
exceeded outmigration by 12,000 people in 1992. The natural population growth rate&#13;
was 1.14 percent in 1992, significantly below the national average of 1.5 percent. Among&#13;
the 13 counties, annual birth rates range from 1.43 percent to 2.14 percent whereas death&#13;
rates range from 0.41 percent to 0.60 percent. The death rates are average for China but&#13;
the birth rates are quite low. This may be attributed to the poor economic conditions and&#13;
successful fanily planning. Many farmers in poor villages recognize that they simply&#13;
cannot raise more children on their small plot of land. Ethnic minorities account for only&#13;
0.2 percent of Yuncheng's population; they are mainly Hui residing mostly in urban areas&#13;
and will be unaffected by the project. Located at the confluence of the Yellow and Wei&#13;
Rivers, Yuncheng was the ancestral birthplace of the Han culture, and the region has&#13;
retained its strong Han dominated characteristics over the centuries.&#13;
2.5   Social Organization and Diversity.  Although the household responsibility&#13;
system has been in place for 10-15 years, the social structure of the previous commune&#13;
system is still evident in the poorer areas of Yuncheng Prefecture. In the lowlard areas,&#13;
households are arranged in compact housing settlements surrounded by farrnland&#13;
allocated on a per capita basis. Most of the villages contain 1,000 to 1,500 people and&#13;
serve as administrative centers. Despite the shift towards free market mechanisms, many&#13;
areas have not modernized due to the lack of investment funds. In addition, the high&#13;
population density and carrying capacity of the land offer few cash income options other&#13;
than horticulture and livestock.  Local governments still maintain a mandatory&#13;
procurement system for cotton and grain, thus effectively reducing the maximum&#13;
cultivated land area that can be converted to orchards to about 20 percent. This is in&#13;
contrast to mountain areas where isolated villages are smaller (&lt;500 people) and housing&#13;
is often scattered. Here the local economy is based on subsistence agriculture and the&#13;
social networks are still closely tied to work groups.&#13;
2.6   Within a village, households share similar livelihoods, assets, and living&#13;
standards.  Outmigration of the better educated villagers often tends to leave the&#13;
remainder of the village stagnant in terms of economic development. Socially, many&#13;
villages change little with time due to the tradition for men to stay in the village and&#13;
women to marry outside the village. Some villagers have gained higher economic and&#13;
social status by heading specialized households (e.g. they own a fruit orchard, or raise&#13;
cattle), but they represent a small proportion of households in most rural areas. Although&#13;
the region is still relatively poor, there has been a general improvement in living&#13;
standards and mobility since the 1 980s. Improved roads and the use of small tractors to&#13;
move people and goods have increased contacts between villages, as well as between&#13;
villages and larger towns and cities. This has helped to promote education, job&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9 -&#13;
opportunities and social interaction. Since there is little ethnic diversity, most villages&#13;
appear quite similar in terms of social and economic structures/networks. There are,&#13;
however, some differences between lowland (market farm) villages and mountain area&#13;
(subsistence) villages. In the latter, physical isolation and low living standards have&#13;
slowed the rate of modernization. Traditional cultures and values are quite dominant in&#13;
these areas.&#13;
2.7   Agriculture. The cultivated area is about 610,000 ha, mainly planted with grain&#13;
crops. The most important crops are wheat (380,000 ha), maize and other grains (73,000&#13;
ha), soybeans and other oilseeds (68,000 ha), cotton (70,000 ha), vegetables and other&#13;
crops (19,000 ha). Double cropping is possible in the lower altitudes with winter wheat&#13;
followed by maize or some other grain crops. Cotton is planted too early and harvested&#13;
too late to allow combination with another crop in the same year. The cropping intensity&#13;
for field crops is about 105 percent. In recent years greenhouse production of fruit and&#13;
vegetables has grown rapidly. Interplanting of Chinese dates, walnuts, apple and pears is&#13;
a common practice. The average farm size is about 0.6 ha. There are about 720,000 large&#13;
animals, mostly cattle, and about 320,000 sheep and goats. There is potential for&#13;
improved irrigation, expansion of fruit and nut trees, and livestock raising. Forest cover&#13;
is about 19 percent.&#13;
2.8   Irrigation. About 200,000 ha in the project area are currently, or have until&#13;
recently, been irrigated to some degree. The largest area of irrigation, the 123,000 ha&#13;
Yuncheng Irrigation Project (YIP), suffers from a shortage of water. This is because a&#13;
shift in the course of the Yellow River has greatly reduced the water supply to pumping&#13;
stations that serve the area. As a result, within the YIP and in other parts of the&#13;
prefecture, there is extensive exploitation of groundwater. This is causing a steady&#13;
decline in pressure in the main deep aquifer, and on many farms the lift in the tubewells is&#13;
over 200 m.&#13;
2.9   Rural Incomes. The average annual income for the rural population was Y 480&#13;
per capita in 1992. This ranged from a low of Y 379 in Pinglu County to a high of Y 574&#13;
in Yongji County. The higher incomes tend to reflect proximity to urban centers or&#13;
mining districts. There appears to be a positive correlation between incomes and grain&#13;
output although nonagricultural sideline production is the key factor in high incomes.&#13;
Since only a small proportion of households benefit directly from township and village&#13;
enterprises (TVEs), the majority of farmers have much lower incomes than the averages&#13;
would suggest. There is little correlation between land area and incomes because the&#13;
traditional commune system had allocated land equitably based on the quality of land.&#13;
2.10  In 1993, income levels rose by an average rate of 22 percent but the real increase&#13;
after inflation was only 8 percent. This was considered a good crop year because the&#13;
rains came at the right time, and yields increased by 27 percent. Profits, however, were&#13;
depressed because crop prices remained low while input costs rose quickly. In 1994,&#13;
incomes rose again by an average rate of 28 percent, but since inflation was very high, the&#13;
real increase was only 4 percent. Fortunately, the farmers benefited from significant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
gains in crop prices which enabled them to keep pace with the general cost of living&#13;
increases. In real terms (1992 prices), the 1994 per capita rural income for Yuncheng was&#13;
Y 540 and ranged from Y 415 in Yuanqu County to Y 636 in Yongji City.&#13;
2.11  Income Distribution. The difference in incomes between 1992 (a normal year)&#13;
and 1993 (a very good year) demonstrates the vulnerability of farmers to weather,&#13;
especially the arnount and timing of rainfall. In 1992, only 2 percent of rural households&#13;
had incomes less than Y 200 per capita but 10 percent were between Y 200 and Y 300&#13;
and 57 percent were between Y 300 and Y 500; 30 percent of households eamed more&#13;
than Y 500 although most of them earned less than Y 800 per capita. In 1993, one of the&#13;
best years for crop output, almost 60 percent of the households earned more than Y 500&#13;
per capita. In 1992, 40 percent of the townships were below the poverty line and 15&#13;
percent of townships were still below the poverty line in 1994. In a year with a serious&#13;
drought, 70 percent of the townships and 80 percent of rural households could fall below&#13;
the poverty line.&#13;
2.12  Education and Health. Yuncheng Prefecture ranks average compared with&#13;
national education levels. Within the adult population (urban and rural), 10 percent are&#13;
classified as illiterate, 43 percent of the adult rural population has only primary school&#13;
education, 46 percent has reached middle school and only 1 percent has achieved higher&#13;
education. Yuncheng Prefecture has good basic facilities for primary education. The&#13;
enrollment in primary school is reported above 98 percent and the dropout rate is only 3&#13;
percent to 5 percent. These good results stem from the fact that primary education is&#13;
mandatory, education is highly valued by villagers and school facilities are available in&#13;
every administrative village and some natural villages. However, the rural facilities are&#13;
limited to essentials, the levels of teacher qualifications are fairly low and the cost of&#13;
education is relatively high for farm families (a typical rural family spends around 30&#13;
percent of its available cash on education). As a consequence, the enrollment rate drops&#13;
to 80 percent for junior middle school and the average dropout rate rises to 40 percent. It&#13;
tends to be much higher in poor and mountain areas where poor access and high costs&#13;
combined with poorly educated students lead to very high dropout rates. The cost of&#13;
junior middle school can be Y 1,200 per child annually if room and board are provided.&#13;
In many cases, the costs of continuing education appear very high compared to the&#13;
perceived opportunities for students.&#13;
2.13  Survey results from villages located closer to the county seats indicate that when&#13;
facilities are available and income levels are higher than average, households place a&#13;
strong emphasis on keeping their children (male and female) in school. Junior middle&#13;
school graduation is a minimum requirement for employment in industrial enterprises.&#13;
There are a number of good upper middle schools and technical schools that provided&#13;
opportunities to good students with adequate financing. The priorities for education are:&#13;
(a) to improve schools and classroom facilities; and (b) to improve the quality of teachers.&#13;
Half of the primary school teachers are paid by the State but the remainder are paid lower&#13;
salaries by local government. The best teachers go to villages that can afford to pay&#13;
higher salaries and bonuses. Therefore, income levels within a village have high positive&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
correlation with the quality of education provided. Local communities have also invested&#13;
in school improvements.&#13;
2.14  Health facilities in the rural areas are basic. Generally each administrative village&#13;
has a three room health clinic with a doctor, pharmacist and nurse. In rural areas, there&#13;
are 2.2 doctors and 2.4 beds per thousand people. On average each township (20,000&#13;
people) maintains only 50 hospital beds. Villagers can get good medical care in larger&#13;
towns and cities but the cost and time required often prevent them from using these&#13;
services. The quality of medical staff is related to the ability of patients to pay for&#13;
services.&#13;
2.15  The health of the rural population is reasonably good considering the standard of&#13;
living.  Basic health education is taught in the schools, and health clinics provide&#13;
education  and  advice  to  adults.    All  children  are  vaccinated  against&#13;
diphtheria/polio/tetanus, smallpox, and  whooping  cough.   The  World  Health&#13;
Organization (WVHO) estimates coverage to be more than 80 percent, with only the most&#13;
isolated areas lacking good programs and facilities. The death rate of children up to age 3&#13;
years is 30 per thousand. The death rate for childbearing women is 0.4 per thousand.&#13;
Endemic diseases in Yuncheng Prefecture include goiter due to a lack of iodine, and bone&#13;
problems caused by high fluoride content in the groundwater supply. Another concern is&#13;
undulant fever (brucellosis) which is transmitted from sheep during milking and birthing.&#13;
Although not reported, there is some evidence of malnutrition due to a lack of protein and&#13;
calories in the local diet of people in poor villages. There are programs to eliminate&#13;
goiter by added iodized salt to food. This is reported to have already been successful and&#13;
most goiter cases are limited to older people. The problem of high fluoride is more&#13;
serious and persistent. The only solution is to provide a better source of drinking water,&#13;
but this is not always affordable. The problem of brucellosis is being tackled by training&#13;
herdsmen how to avoid the disease.&#13;
C. LULIANG PREFECTURE&#13;
2.16  Geographic Location. The seven project counties in Luliang Prefecture cover an&#13;
area of 11,000 kM2 with a population of 1.2 million, of which 93 percent is rural. The&#13;
project area is in the west central part of Shanxi and is bounded on the west by the&#13;
Yellow River. Almost all of the land is mountainous or hilly at an altitude between 1,000&#13;
and 2,000 meters. The topography shows a landform common in the loess plateau, with&#13;
steep slopes and numerous deeply eroded gullies. More than 50 percent of the area has&#13;
slopes over 15 degrees, and the gully area amounts to more than 40 percent with a density&#13;
of 3 kilometers of gully per square kilometer. Large areas of the slope lands have been&#13;
terraced to conserve moisture for crops and to prevent soil erosion. Luliang has a&#13;
temperate continental climate. Annual precipitation averages 500 mm, mostly in the&#13;
form of rain in the months of May to September. Temperatures reach 350C in the&#13;
summner and can fall as low as -1 0°C in the winter. The frost-free period is between 150&#13;
and 170 days. Climate and topography impose limitations on agriculture, but over 85&#13;
percent of the population in this remote prefecture depend on farming for their livelihood.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
Over 75 percent of the villages in Luliang have no telephone service, and 490 villages&#13;
have no roads suitable for motor vehicles.&#13;
2.17  Luliang Prefecture is comprised of 13 counties, but only the seven poorest&#13;
counties are included in the project. The project counties include 117 townships (xiang)&#13;
and 2,515 administrative villages. The average size of villages in Luliang is only 450&#13;
people compared to 1,1 50 in Yuncheng. Some townships in the seven counties are not&#13;
included in the proposed project since they are already being assisted under other projects&#13;
financed by the Bank Group and other agencies.&#13;
2.18  Population Characteristics. In the project area, 884,000 people have poverty&#13;
status. The project area represents 39 percent of the total prefecture population but&#13;
comprises 61 percent of the households below the poverty line. Migration in and out of&#13;
the prefecture is quite small and balanced, representing about 1.4 percent of the total&#13;
population annually. The natural population growth rate was 1.01 percent in 1992, well&#13;
below the national average of 1.5 percent. Amongst the seven project counties, annual&#13;
birth rates range from 1.34 percent to 1.70 percent and death rates range from 0.39&#13;
percent to 0.62 percent. The death rates are slightly below the national average for China&#13;
whereas the birth rates are considerably lower, particularly in rural areas. There are only&#13;
404 ethnic minority people residing in Luliang Prefecture and only about 70 are&#13;
registered in the project area.&#13;
2.19 Social Organization and Diversity. Villages on the loess plateau in Luliang can&#13;
be characterized as typical mountain villages. These are small and isolated with houses&#13;
commonly scattered. The focus is on subsistence agriculture, and social networks are still&#13;
closely tied to work groups and kinship. The better educated villagers have been&#13;
migrating to towns and cities leaving the remainder of the village stagnant in terms of&#13;
economic development. There is also a pronounced outmigration of young women from&#13;
poor villages to marry men in wealthier villages. This has a significant impact on the&#13;
socioeconomic system of poor villages (e.g., fewer children, fewer nuclear families, more&#13;
laborers per household).  Physical isolation, low education levels and poor living&#13;
standards have slowed uiie rate of modernization. Traditional cultures and values are&#13;
quite dominant in these areas.&#13;
2.20  Agriculture. The area under crops is about 198,000 ha. The main crops are millet&#13;
and sorghurn (70,000 ha), maize (23,000 ha), soybeans and other oilseeds (95,000 ha),&#13;
vegetables and other crops (10,000 ha). The area is generally single cropped since the&#13;
growing season is too short to permnit double cropping. Irrigation is limited to an area of&#13;
17,000 ha with limited scope for expansion. Fruit and nut trees are beginning to be more&#13;
widely grown on the terraces and the project area is a major producer of Chinese dates.&#13;
The average farm size is about 1.0 ha. Draft animals, mainly cattle, number about&#13;
150,000, and there are about 900,000 sheep and goats. There is considerable scope for&#13;
expansion of fruit and nut trees, livestock raising and further increases in terracing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
2.21   Rural Incomes. The rural population is primarily employed in the production of&#13;
field crops, orchard management and animal husbandry for domestic needs. Agricultural&#13;
conditions are constrained and income levels are low unless there are mining activities in&#13;
the township. Closer to the urban centers, the rural population has good opportunities for&#13;
sideline activities and nonagricultural employment. The commercial sector is not well&#13;
developed except in the county seats. Good road transportation is limited to the main&#13;
river valleys where paved county roads connect the major centers. In other areas,&#13;
transportation is poor and roads that do exist become impassable during rains.&#13;
2.22  The average annual income for the rural population was Y 318 per capita in 1992.&#13;
This ranged from a low of Y 272 in Xingxian County to Y 372 in Liulin County. In&#13;
1992, 104 (89 percent) of the 117 townships had incomes below the poverty level of&#13;
Y 400. In 1993, income levels rose by an average of 24 percent but the real increase was&#13;
10 percent. In 1994, income levels rose another 45 percent due to higher grain prices. In&#13;
real terms (1992 prices), the 1994 per capita rural income for the Luliang project area was&#13;
Y 398 and ranged from Y 316 in the four project townships of Lishi City to Y 435 in&#13;
Liulin County. Although this has been an impressive 25 percent real increase since 1992,&#13;
there were still 82 townships (70 percent) below the poverty line and only 9 townships&#13;
with more than Y 500 per capita in 1992 prices. However, in a bad year, 95 percent of&#13;
the townships are likely to fall below the poverty line.&#13;
2.23  Income Distribution. Seven percent of rural households had incomes less than&#13;
Y 200 per capita but 32.3 percent were between Y 200 and Y 300 and 52.6 percent were&#13;
between Y 300 and Y 500. Roughly 70 percent of the households fell below the poverty&#13;
line (Y 400 per capita). Only 8 percent of households earned more than Y 500. When&#13;
incomes rose by 24 percent in 1993, 82 percent of the households still earned less than&#13;
Y 500 per capita.&#13;
2.24  Education and Health The Luliang project area has below-average education&#13;
levels. Within the adult rural population, 20 percent are classified as illiterate. An&#13;
estimated 49 percent of the adult rural population has only primary school education, 30&#13;
percent has reached middle school and less than 1 percent has achieved higher education.&#13;
Luliang is a poverty stricken prefecture and consequently primary education facilities are&#13;
quite limited. Despite the poor quality of schools, teachers and materials, the total&#13;
enrollment in primary school is reported to be above 98 percent and the dropout rate is&#13;
low. Although primary education is mandatory and education is highly valued by&#13;
villagers, the schools are limited in buildings and facilities, and this tends to reduce the&#13;
effectiveness of education. Primary schools are available in most administrative villages.&#13;
However, due to the isolation of numerous natural villages, it is difficult to provide good&#13;
quality and affordable primary education to every household.&#13;
2.25  Health facilities in the rural areas are quite limited. Many villages have makeshift&#13;
clinics managed by "barefoot doctors". The conditions of facilities and staff are well&#13;
below national standards but programs are now underway to improve the situation. In&#13;
rural areas, there are only 1.4 doctors and 2.7 hospital beds per thousand people.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
Villagers can get adequate medical care in larger towns and county seats but the costs are&#13;
often beyond their means. Health problems in rural areas are relatively moderate&#13;
considering the standard of living. Basic health education is taught in the schools and&#13;
health clinics provides education and advice to adults. Most children are vaccinated for&#13;
the prevention of diphtheria/polio/tetanus, smallpox, and whooping cough. The infant&#13;
mortality rate is 58 per thousand (high due to TB and stillbirths) while the death rate of&#13;
children up to age 5 years is 74 per thousand. The death rate for childbearing women is&#13;
2.2 per thousand. The endemic disease situation is similar to that of Yuncheng.&#13;

C. PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
3.3   Langdian Pumping Complex. The Langdian Pumping Complex will increase&#13;
the supply of water to the Yuncheng Irrigation System in the southern part of Yuncheng&#13;
Prefecture. In the past. three pumping stations were built to lift water from the Yellow&#13;
River to this system. But the river channel, which was close to the left bank when the&#13;
pumping stations were built, has moved away from the river bank. Now, every year&#13;
channels are excavated from the active channel to the pumps but these fill with sediment&#13;
when the river is in flood and sometimes the channels have to be excavated several times&#13;
a year during the flood season. The details of the pumping stations are summarized&#13;
below:&#13;
Design                               Date of      Present&#13;
Capacity     Head        Date         River       Capacity&#13;

Jiamakou          9.5         10         1960          1976           7&#13;
Xiaofan           6.0         18         1961          1969           0&#13;
Zuncun           46.5          7         1978          1987          15&#13;
3.4   The current water delivery capacity is only 22 cms compared to the design&#13;
capacity of 62 cms. This problem is to be overcome by building the new Langdian&#13;
pumping station upstream of the three existing stations and connecting it to them through&#13;
a 13.5 km canal. The capacity of the pumping station will be 43 cms. In addition,&#13;
floating pumps with a capacity of 18 cms will be placed near the Zuncun station. A 1.5&#13;
km long channel between the river and the Zuncun station will require annual&#13;
maintenance dredging.&#13;
3.5   The site of the Langdian station is at a point in the river where the channel is close&#13;
to the left bank and is believed to be stable. Satellite images show that the site has been&#13;
free from sediment accretion since 1980, the date of the earliest images. Flow patterns&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
during this period have been superimposed on the imagery, and these show that the bulk&#13;
of the flow stayed close to the left bank, except in 1984. In that year, the main flow&#13;
shifted away but pumping would still have been possible at the proposed site. Local&#13;
people at the site report that the channel has been stable in its present location for more&#13;
than 30 years. From a review of all the available data, a team of river training experts&#13;
from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission (YRCC) and IDA has concluded that&#13;
the river channel at the site is stable and is likely to remain so. In the case of a major&#13;
flood event there is a possibility that the main channel could shift further to the right&#13;
bank. The dredges operating in the desilting pond would then be used to maintain an&#13;
intake channel on the left bank. Further details are given in Annex 3.&#13;
3.6   Yuncheng Irrigation System. The Yuncheng Irrigation System in the southern&#13;
part of Yuncheng Prefecture was planned to serve an area of about 123,000 ha. Works&#13;
built to date command an area of about 90,000 ha. The project provides for rehabilitation&#13;
of the existing stations, canals and other structures, and completion of the Yuncheng&#13;
irrigation system, except for 10,000 ha in the upper part that have been excluded because&#13;
of difficult topography. The completion works consist mainly of constructing lateral&#13;
canals (and sublaterals), each of which serves about 60 ha, over an area of 33,000 ha.&#13;
Because of the loss of pumping capacity, most of this area has for years depended on&#13;
tubewells; this has led to a fall in the groundwater level to nearly 100 meters in some&#13;
areas and the level continues to fall by 2 meters a year. This situation is not sustainable,&#13;
and there is a need to greatly increase the input of surface water to the area to avoid&#13;
further depletion of the aquifer and conserve the groundwater resource for domestic use.&#13;
The combined capacity of Langdian and the floating pumps will be sufficient to meet&#13;
virtually all of the irrigation demands from surface water. In the months of July and&#13;
August the sediment load in the Yellow River is high and the pumping will be reduced to&#13;
avoid silting up of the canals. During these months, surface water will be supplemented&#13;
by groundwater to meet the relatively low wet-season demands of the irrigated area.&#13;
3.7   River Beach Development. About 13,000 ha of protected land along the river&#13;
(river beach land) in eight counties of Yuncheng is proposed for development. Much of&#13;
this land did not exist until the 1950's when a change in the river's course left behind&#13;
flood plains where the sediment gradually accumulated to form new land. About 80&#13;
percent of the land is now under crops and plantations, but only 20 percent is irrigated&#13;
mainly by 690 tubewells (the area has ample groundwater resources). The land is leased&#13;
to the villages on the high ground bordering the river. These lands can be made highly&#13;
productive at a relatively low cost. The component includes installation of 1,300&#13;
tubewells and associated electrification, light land leveling on 13,000 ha, and upgrading&#13;
of 175 km of rural road. It further includes an aquaculture component consisting of the&#13;
rehabilitation of 330 ha existing but badly deteriorated fish ponds, and construction of&#13;
200 ha new fish ponds. A new fish hatchery covering 5.3 ha will supply the necessary&#13;
fry. Furthermore a fish farmers' association will be established to provide market&#13;
intelligence and technical advice, and conduct applied research. An area of about 1,300&#13;
ha of undeveloped beach land which attracts large numbers of migratory waterfowl has&#13;
been designated by the province as a nature reserve. The project will establish necessary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18-&#13;
infrastructure for the reserve, such as a forest protection belt and observation points for&#13;
visitors.&#13;
3.8   Rural Water Supply. There is a severe shortage of water in many villages in&#13;
both prefectures. In Yuncheng, wells to produce a reliable supply of good quality water&#13;
(20-30 m3/hour) have to be between 150 and 300 meters deep. In Luliang, groundwater&#13;
can be found in shallow aquifers (10-15 m deep) in the beds of gullies, but these can only&#13;
be pumped for a few hours at 5-10 m3/hour. Most villages get their water from pits in the&#13;
ground (cisterns) filled with storm runoff, and from shallow wells in the beds of gullies.&#13;
The latter are very low yielding and in the dry season people have to wait for hours for&#13;
the wells to recharge after the first villagers have filled their buckets. Water is often sold&#13;
in the villages by people who have access to a well in their own village. The average&#13;
family in water-short areas spends around Y' 100 in a year on drinking water-this is&#13;
about 10 percent of the average family income. In addition to the cash cost, the water&#13;
shortage also causes many hours to be spent hauling water which could be spent on more&#13;
productive activities. In most cases, the source provided by the project will be a well&#13;
which feeds one or more storage tanks. Water is piped to the villages' distribution&#13;
systems from the storage tanks. Cisterns will be built in small villages where the people&#13;
cannot afford the investment and operating cost of a pumped system. A better water&#13;
supply will also: (a) expand possibilities for villagers to own draft animals for farming&#13;
and transportation; (b) reduce the incidence of water-borne diseases; and (c) allow for&#13;
watering of seedlings in orchard establishment. Operation and maintenance of the system&#13;
will be the responsibility of the village, and is usually contracted out to an individual&#13;
household.&#13;
3.9   In Yuncheng, the plan covers 78 comparatively large systems including 59 deep&#13;
well systems and 19 diversion schemes serving 516 villages, 620,000 people and 120,000&#13;
draft animals.  Luliang plans to construct water supply facilities for 204 villages,&#13;
including 77 deep well systems, 65 schemes based on springs, and 1,179 household&#13;
cisterns in the remaining 62 villages. The schemes will serve 64,000 people or about 50&#13;
percent of the remaining population of 135,000 in Luliang without access to reliable&#13;
drinking water. The other 50 percent of the villages will receive water supply systems&#13;
using local poverty alleviation funds during the same period.&#13;
3.10  Rural Roads. The existing highway systems in the prefectures are in reasonable&#13;
condition and well maintained, but there is considerable scope to improve and extend&#13;
existing rural roads to provide all-weather access to some of the townships. Both the&#13;
provincial government and the local population attach great importance to extending the&#13;
rural road network to remote communities as a way to reduce poverty. The project will&#13;
support this policy in both prefectures. The component will upgrade existing roads and&#13;
tracks to Class 4 Standard (Rural Roads). The roads will be 7.5 meters wide (a 6 m&#13;
pavement of 20 cm of compacted gravel, and 0.75 m shoulders). The improved roads&#13;
will: (a) lower transport costs of inputs and outputs for farmers and small mines;&#13;
(b) attract buyers for farm produce; and (c) lead to new bus services, or more frequent&#13;
services, that will expand opportunities for off-farm employment and education. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
project includes upgrading six roads with a total length of 209 km in Yuncheng and five&#13;
roads totaling II 8 km in Luliang.&#13;
3.11   Soil and Water Conservation. This component in Luliang Prefecture includes&#13;
terracing on slope land, construction of sediment control dams, and afforestation on slope&#13;
land that is too steep for terracing or crop cultivation. Terracing is planned for 13,400 ha.&#13;
The conversion of slope lands to terraces serves a number of purposes. First, it creates a&#13;
better environment for crop production through moisture conservation; in a year of&#13;
average rainfall, grain yields on terraces are two to three times higher than on slope lands.&#13;
Second, terraced land is more resistant to damaging soil erosion during intense storms&#13;
than slope land. And third. sediment runoff is much lower from terraces than from sloped&#13;
land. Generally, terraces are confined to lands where slopes are less than 200. But where&#13;
there is a shortage of crop land, terraces are built on slopes up to 250. Soils are deep in&#13;
Luliang and the area is therefore well suited to terracing, but the topsoil is often set aside&#13;
and replaced upon completion of the terrace. About 7,600 ha will be wide terraces of&#13;
13-16 m built on slopes of 5°-10°, and 5,800 ha will be narrower terraces of 10-13m built&#13;
on slopes of 10°-15°. The terraces will be level and the lower parts of the risers vertical,&#13;
with a sloping top to allow for establishment of grasses and other vegetative cover plants&#13;
to protect the riser from erosion. After terracing, the fields will be deep plowed, fertilized&#13;
with 150 kg of urea and 300 kg of superphosphate. The main crops will be sorghum,&#13;
maize, millet, beans, potatoes and sunflower.&#13;
3.12   The works also include the construction of 56 sediment control dams. These are&#13;
earth dams with heights between 10 and 25 meters built in the gullies. Gross initial&#13;
storage capacities range between 100,000 m3 and 1,000,000 mi3.  The dams reduce&#13;
flooding and sediment loads in the downstream rivers, and the sediment deposits behind&#13;
the dams create high quality agricultural land, estimated for these dams to amount to 270&#13;
ha. Numerous similar dams have been built in Luliang. The procedures for design&#13;
review and supervision will be the same as those adopted for the dams financed under the&#13;
Loess Plateau Project (para. 3.25). These procedures are fully consistent with Bank&#13;
Group standards. The reservoir sites are in deeply eroded gullies and are devoid of&#13;
agriculture and human habitation. During the first few years after construction, the water&#13;
stored behind the dams can be used for irrigation and village water supplies.&#13;
3.13   Afforestation  is another important component of the integrated watershed&#13;
development. Tree planting is planned for 4,200 ha of steep slopes and wasteland.&#13;
Chinese pine, larch and poplar are the main species suited to the area. Trees will be&#13;
planted on land where the steep slope or poor soils render it unsuitable for crops or&#13;
orchards. This increases the supply of fuel wood and lumber, and improves soil and&#13;
water conservation. Poplar will mainly be planted on gentle slopes without terraces.&#13;
Pine and larch will be planted on narrow terraces on land with steep slopes (20°-30°).&#13;
Participating households will tend I ha of plantings. The area planted will be 1,400 ha of&#13;
each of the three species giving a total plantation area of 4,200 ha. In practice, the three&#13;
species, together with other suitable tree and shrub species, will be established as mixed&#13;
plantations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
3.14  Horticulture. The prefectures specialize in Chinese dates and prickly ash (a&#13;
source of spices) and other fruits and nuts. In Luliang, the fruit trees selected for planting&#13;
are Chinese date (Zizyphus jujuba), kernel apricot (Prunus armeniaca), walnut (Juglans&#13;
regia) and apples and pears. Generally, plantation will be on low-yielding hilly or&#13;
mountainous areas with slopes of 150-20°. In Yuncheng, fiuit and nut trees to be planted&#13;
are Chinese date, Chinese prickly ash (Xanthoxylum bungaenum), walnut and chestnut&#13;
(Castanea mollissima). Fruit trees are normally interplanted with field crops such as&#13;
wheat and soybean in Yuncheng and millet and soybean in Luliang. The choice of&#13;
varieties and the establishment and management of the plantations draws on successful&#13;
experience in the past. The total proposed fruit tree area to be intercropped is 69,240 ha&#13;
distributed as follows:&#13;
Yuncheng (ha)                   Luliang (ha)&#13;
Dates                                23,270                          15,000&#13;
Prickly Ash                           12,500&#13;
Apricots (kernel)                                                     2,800&#13;
Walnuts                               8,870                           2,800&#13;
Chestnut                               3,300&#13;
Apples and Pears                           -                            700&#13;
Total (ha)                         47,940                          21,300&#13;
3.15  In Luliang, trees will generally be planted on slope land on narrow terraces I m&#13;
wide. Depending on the tree crop planted, farmers will be able to intercrop for 3-7 years&#13;
before the trees reach maturity. In contrast with the system to be adopted in Luliang, the&#13;
Chinese dates in Yuncheng will be planted at wide interrow spacings (15 m) in lowland&#13;
cereal fields, and grain cropping will continue over the whole life of the tree. In Luliang,&#13;
the present nursery capacity is inadequate for a program of this size. Accordingly, the&#13;
project will finance material inputs for 250 small household nurseries each of 0.1 ha. The&#13;
project will also provide for the construction of a tissue culture laboratory at the Forestry&#13;
Research Station at Lishi with an initial annual capacity of around 50,000 plantlets per&#13;
year. This technique is well established in China and is successfully used for Chinese&#13;
date propagation in Henan Province. Chinese dates are somewhat difficult to multiply&#13;
with traditional techniques, thus a rapid multiplication technique is appropriate to ensure&#13;
that sufficient high quality seedlings of high value varieties are available.&#13;
3.16  Livestock.  The provincial poverty alleviation program already includes the&#13;
distribution of cattle to some poor households. Demand is strong, and rural households,&#13;
especially the women, rank the ownership of a large animal among the highest priorities&#13;
to improve their incomes. All livestock are valued, not only for their directly saleable&#13;
products, but also for their manure, as a form of savings, and, in the case of cattle, as&#13;
draught animals. Technically, ruminant livestock also fit in well to the farming systems,&#13;
which in many areas have abundant unused crop residues, and there is a potential for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
increased fodder production from wasteland too steep or too poor to be brought into&#13;
arable cultivation.&#13;
3.17  The main feature of the livestock component will be the introduction of large&#13;
animals to new households selected from amongst small farmers with limited financial&#13;
resources. This will provide the opportunity for immediate cash savings and new income&#13;
generation. In addition, acquisition of animals will increase the security of households&#13;
and their ability to cope with unexpected crises. All these benefits meet the fundamental&#13;
criteria of poverty alleviation and give the component a strong justification. However,&#13;
livestock keeping is not without risk and the design of the component will recognize the&#13;
limited technical and management knowledge and financial vulnerability of new project&#13;
livestock farmers. Supporting this primary initiative will be investments to improve&#13;
veterinary services, the existing artificial insemination program, research activities and&#13;
the development and expansion of new technology. The component consists of: (a) the&#13;
introduction of livestock to poor and marginal farmers who have access to adequate crop&#13;
residues and/or large areas of unimproved natural pasture; (b) the improvement of&#13;
veterinary and artificial insemination services; (c) the introduction of better techniques&#13;
for silage making and the upgrading of artificial and natural pastures amongst existing&#13;
livestock owners; and (d) the development of research topics which will assist small&#13;
livestock farmers, as well as training for project officials and farmers.&#13;
3.18  New project livestock farmers will be provided with one or two breeding cows,&#13;
depending on resource availability. In the river beach land areas, some farmers will be&#13;
provided with a nucleus flock of sheep. The farmers themselves will construct the&#13;
necessary livestock shelter, water trough and silage pits. Repayment will be scheduled&#13;
over 6-12 years and farmers will be required to take out an insurance policy against the&#13;
death of their foundation animals. Simple low-cost fodder conservation techniques such&#13;
as ammoniated straw silage will be promoted and farmers will be encouraged to keep&#13;
their operational cash commitments to a minimum. Up to 13,000 farmers will receive&#13;
assistance under this component.&#13;
3.19  Improvements to the facilities and the equipment of about 220 existing veterinary&#13;
service stations will take place, and support will be provided for the Shanxi Frozen&#13;
Semen Center in Taiyuan, the Jinan Yellow Cattle Breeding Center in Yuncheng and a&#13;
frozen semen and liquid nitrogen production center in Lishi. To promote better quality&#13;
silage making, grass/straw choppers will be procured and sold to existing livestock&#13;
owners. Crop residues from a number of farmers will be handled by a single chopping&#13;
machine and every effort will be made to locate machines in villages where new livestock&#13;
farmers are to be established.&#13;
3.20  Agricultural Processing. Agroprocessing plants provide markets for farmers'&#13;
outputs, add value to commodities close to their point of production, and provide&#13;
employment. The proposed agroindustries are unlikely to face input shortages as they&#13;
will make use of additional agricultural production as raw material for their operations.&#13;
The selected enterprises consist of a mix of TVEs and county-operated companies. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
individual investments will be relatively small (less than $1 million in each case). The&#13;
key criteria for their inclusion into the project included considerations of comparative&#13;
advantage, market opportunities and management expertise.  The companies will&#13;
participate in a pilot program which will involve submission of an enterprise reform plan,&#13;
and they will experiment with various incentive systems and reforms of their ownership&#13;
structure towards a shareholder system   during implementation.  The following&#13;
enterprises will be included in the project. They involve expansion and improvement of&#13;
existing small plants except where noted. Each plant is briefly described in Annex I1.&#13;

3.21 All China Women's Federation. The All China Women's Federation (ACWF)&#13;
through local women's federations, manages a number of active programs in the project&#13;
areas to support women in income-producing enterprises and activities.' Among these&#13;
are skill training in handicrafts, rabbit, poultry and pig production and a range of sideline&#13;
activities. The ACWF programs specifically target poor and disadvantaged women, and&#13;
their activities will complement many of the project's other components.  Under the&#13;
project the ACWF will identify small and focused subprojects to generate cash income&#13;
for women in remote villages. These will mainly consist of small livestock raising (pigs,&#13;
poultry, rabbits), combined with training programns. The ACWF has adequate training&#13;
facilities in Luliang, which will be supplemented with selected equipment and training&#13;
materials. Larger individual credits offered to women for commercial activities will first&#13;
be appraised by local branches of the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC), following&#13;
standard credit procedures before approval by the Project Management Offices (PMOs).&#13;
l The Luliang Branch of the ACWF has received national recognition for its innovative approach to help poor women.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
The IDA credit will fund the part of the costs of the ACWF component, amounting to&#13;
some $0.3 million. This would include the weaner pig production farm (about Y 182,000&#13;
for works, Y 110,000 for equipment, Y 500,000 for livestock purchase, feed and&#13;
veterinary services), small livestock enterprises (about Y 3.0 million), and training (about&#13;
Y 750,000). The component is described in more detail in Annex 10.&#13;
3.22  Project Management Support Services. The prefectures will provide equipment&#13;
and facilities for project management, project monitoring and training. In Luliang,&#13;
Yuncheng, and Taiyuan. this includes upgrading of office buildings, provision of&#13;
vehicles, and office equipment. Training centers will be updated in both prefectures and&#13;
equipped with furniture and audiovisual equipment.  Extension services will be&#13;
strengthened in each county. including renovation of buildings and supply of equipment&#13;
and vehicles. Monitoring and evaluation of the impact of project activities will be&#13;
supported through upgrading of observation stations and provision of equipment.&#13;
3.23  Training and Overseas Study Tours. The project includes 21 staff months of&#13;
overseas study tours, 16 staff months of overseas training, and 70 staff months of&#13;
domestic study tours covering all aspects of project management, monitoring, and&#13;
technical training. At negotiations assurances were obtained that Shanxi will prepare&#13;
and furnish to the Association hy November 30 of each year, a proposed program of&#13;
training activities to be carried out during the following calendar year and thereafter,&#13;
implement such program as approved by the Association (see para. 4. 1).&#13;
D. STATUS OF DESIGNS&#13;
3.24  Designs are virtually complete for the irrigation components, beach land, roads,&#13;
water supplies, and soil conservation works, and for most of the agroprocessing&#13;
enterprises. Preparation of construction drawings and bid documents for the irrigation&#13;
works will be completed by early 1996.&#13;
3.25  Current procedures require multilevel technical reviews and approval of the&#13;
design and construction of sediment control dams. Preliminary designs are carried out by&#13;
county water and soil conservation bureaus. Initial review and approval of structural&#13;
design and siting are carried out by provincial water and soil conservation authorities who&#13;
are responsible for ensuring compliance with design procedures and technical&#13;
specifications. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that all dams (a) which&#13;
will either exceed 10 m in height or create a reservoir with a gross storage volume of&#13;
2,500, 000 cubic meters or more, or (b) which possess unusual design features, involve&#13;
difficult geological conditions, or are situated so as to be significantly destructive in the&#13;
event of a failure, will be (i) subject to independent reviews as to their designs and&#13;
construction by a panel, whose membership and TORs are acceptable to the Association,&#13;
and (ii) periodically inspected by the panel in accordance with sound engineering&#13;
practices in order to determine whether there are any deficiencies which may endanger&#13;
their safety.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
E. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
3.26  The project will be implemented over a period of six years. Project completion is&#13;
expected by December 31, 2001, and the credit closing by December 31, 2002. Most of&#13;
the construction for the irrigation system and beach land will be by manual labor,&#13;
employing farmers in the project area. The peak periods for labor availability are after&#13;
the wheat harvest in July/August, and in the winter until the planting season in&#13;
April/May. During this period there will be long spells when it is too cold for concrete&#13;
work and the ground is too hard for manual excavation. Thus, for manual labor the&#13;
construction season lasts for about 180 days. For work carried out with equipment,&#13;
construction can proceed for most of the year except for the coldest months. An&#13;
implementation schedule is shown in Annex 15.&#13;
F. COST ESTIMATES AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
3.27 The project has an estimated cost of $182.8 million, including $26.6 million of&#13;
foreign exchange ( 15 percent of the total). Cost estimates are summarized in Table 3. 1.&#13;
A more detailed summary with an expenditure schedule is given in Annex2, and cost&#13;
estimates for individual components are given in the relevant annexes. Project cost&#13;
estimates reflect end- 1995 prices using a unit cost approach in which unit prices are&#13;
applied to detailed quantity estimates. The unit prices are based on experience with&#13;
similar works and projects in the prefectures. Where unit prices were not available, they&#13;
were derived by estimating labor, material and equipment inputs. Since there are no large&#13;
physical uncertainties, a physical contingency of 5 percent has been applied to the&#13;
construction costs. Project works are labor-intensive, and labor rates for off-season&#13;
employment are not likely to be subject to the sharp escalation now being experienced in&#13;
more prosperous parts of China. Also, many of the villagers employed on the project will&#13;
stand to benefit from the improvements in land productivity and, therefore, the counties&#13;
will have some leverage in setting rates. Expected price increases for the total project&#13;
cost expressed in Yuan were derived by applying price escalation of 10.5 percent for&#13;
1996, 8.5 percent for 1997, and 7.0 percent for 1998, 6.5 percent for 1999 and 6.2 percent&#13;
for the following years. For the total cost expressed in US dollars, the escalation factors&#13;
are 1.8 percent for 1996, 2.6 percent for 1997 and 2.5 percent after 1997.&#13;

G. PROCUREMENT&#13;
Works&#13;
3.29 Civil Works worth $73.4 million would be required for the project comprising&#13;
Yuncheng irrigation system infrastructure ($30.9 million), beach land development&#13;
infrastructure ($10.3 million), water supply ($6.7 million), rural roads ($18 million), and&#13;
buildings ($7.5 million). Except for the Langdian pumping complex in the Yuncheng&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
irrigation system, the civil works for this component consist of many small undertakings&#13;
spread throughout the project areas ($21.0 million) and to be built under force account by&#13;
experienced country teams in cooperation with the beneficiaries over a period of five to&#13;
six years. Structures costing about $9.9 million at Langdian pumping complex would be&#13;
procured through national competitive bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to the&#13;
Association. The beach land works include a variety of activities such as well-drilling,&#13;
leveling, earth roads, irrigation canals, and electrification. These works ($10.3 million)&#13;
would also be carried out under force account. Supervision of these works will be the&#13;
responsibility of the Yuncheng Water Conservancy Bureau.  Rural roads involve&#13;
improvement of the existing roads and some new bridges and culverts. The sites are&#13;
widely separated and it is difficult to quantify the work in advance. With the exception of&#13;
some large structures ($2.5 million), that will be contracted out through NCB procedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA, these will be built as force account operations ($15.5 million) by the&#13;
county road construction teams employing the villagers living along the roads. The water&#13;
supply works consist of well-drilling, construction of pumping stations and storage tanks,&#13;
and laying of distribution pipes. These will be executed by county water conservancy&#13;
bureaus under the direction of the prefecture water conservancy staff ($6.7 million).&#13;
Villagers will assist in installing the distribution systems. Buildings for project offices&#13;
and agroprocessing enterprises ($6.1 million) will be procured through NCB procedures&#13;
acceptable to IDA.&#13;
3.30 Soil and water conservation works in Luliang ($15.9 million) will be carried out&#13;
under force account by the villages with assistance from equipment deployed by the&#13;
county and township soil conservation teams. The horticulture component would be&#13;
carried out under force account by the villages ($22.5 million for the establishment and&#13;
tending of fruit orchards), under the supervision of the local agriculture bureaus. In total,&#13;
works costing $92 million equivalent or less in aggregate, may, with the Association's&#13;
prior agreement, be carried out under force account by experienced country teams in close&#13;
cooperation with the project beneficiaries. The above force account works are justified&#13;
due to the labor-intensive and scattered nature of the works to be carried out over a span&#13;
of time, and are considered unsuitable for competitive bidding.&#13;
Goods&#13;
3.31 Equipment and materials worth $34 million would be required for the project&#13;
comprising equipment for agroprocessing ($7 million), pumps and motors ($3.8 million),&#13;
electrical equipment ($7.1 million), dredgers and excavators ($2.4 million), PVC pipes&#13;
($2 million), fertilizers ($7.4 million), vehicles ($2 million) and miscellaneous equipment&#13;
($2.3 million). ICB procurement procedures would apply to most pumps and motors&#13;
($3.4 million), electrical transformers ($4.0 million), dredges and excavators ($2.4&#13;
million), PVC pipe ($1.8 million), fertilizer ($7.4 million), and most vehicles ($1.7&#13;
million) for a total of $20.7 million. To the extent practicable, contracts for goods would&#13;
be grouped into bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent of $250,000 or more for&#13;
each. A margin of preference equal to 15 percent of the CIF price of imported goods or&#13;
the actual customs duties and import taxes, whichever is less, will be allowed to domestic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
manufacturers bidding under ICB procedures. Equipment for agroprocessing ($7 million)&#13;
includes numerous items of processing equipment of many different types for 21&#13;
enterprises. These will be procured and installed over a period of three to four years and&#13;
cannot be packaged for ICB; therefore, they will be procured through national and&#13;
international shopping.  Some pumps and motors ($0.4 million), conductors and&#13;
insulators ($3.1 million), a small portion of the PVC pipes ($0.2 million), some vehicles&#13;
($0.3 million), and other small equipment ($2.3 million) would be procured through&#13;
national and international shopping. In summary, equipment, vehicles and materials&#13;
costing $250,000 or less per contract, and $13,300,000 or less in the aggregate, may be&#13;
procured through shopping.&#13;
3.32 In addition, animals for the livestock component ($11.9 million) would be procured&#13;
through national shopping procedures at regional or local markets by teams comprising&#13;
representatives from the beneficiary villages and the local animal husbandry bureaus.&#13;
Consultancy Services and Training&#13;
3.33  Services worth $17.3 million would be required for the project and comprise&#13;
training services ($2.2 million), project management ($14 million) and various services&#13;
for the livestock and horticulture components ($1.1 million).  Consultants will be&#13;
employed in accordance with Bank Group guidelines for the use of consultants and the&#13;
use of the Bank's standard form of contract for consultants' services. Miscellaneous&#13;
expenditures amounting to $7.2 million and comprising mainly recurrent operating&#13;
expenditures will not be financed by the Bank/IDA, including project management of $14&#13;
million.&#13;
3.34 IDA Approval and Review. All contracts for goods would be grouped into bid&#13;
packages whenever possible to attract competition and permit bulk purchasing. Standard&#13;
bidding documents approved by IDA would be used. All contracts for goods of $250,000&#13;
or more would be subject to prior review by IDA, which would cover about 80 percent of&#13;
the total goods by value. All contracts for works of $1 million equivalent or more would&#13;
be subject to prior review. All contracts for consultant services in excess of $100,000 for&#13;
engagement of firms, and $50,000 for engagement of individuals would be subject to&#13;
prior review by IDA, which would cover about 75 percent of the total consultant services&#13;
by value. For consultants' contracts below these thresholds, prior review will apply to&#13;
terms of reference, single source selection, assignments of a critical nature and any&#13;
amendments that would raise contract value above the prior review threshold. Other&#13;
contracts for goods would be subject to ex-post review by IDA supervision missions.&#13;
The procurement profile is shown in Table 3.3. The International Tendering Company&#13;
(ITC) of the China International Trust &amp; Investment Corporation has been chosen to&#13;
represent Shanxi Province in procurement matters.&#13;

3.36   Retroactive financing is recommended for payments made between August 1,&#13;
1995 and the date of signing of the Credit Agreement. The construction season in the&#13;
project areas depends on the climate and the farmers' cropping cycle. Therefore, the&#13;
prefectures must begin construction in the winter of 1995 to ensure a full working season.&#13;
Retroactive financing will also cover the necessary funds for completion of detailed&#13;
designs for several components. The total amount of retroactive financing will be SDR&#13;
6.73 million ($10.0 million equivalent) based on work programs reviewed by IDA.&#13;
3.37   Statements of expenditure (SOEs) will be required for disbursement to be made&#13;
against (a) contracts for goods costing less than $250,000, (b) study tours and training,&#13;
(c) civil works costing less than $1 million, and (d) consultants' services costing less than&#13;
$100,000 for firms, and less than $50,000 for individuals. For force account works, unit&#13;
prices were decided by the CPMO and IDA at negotiations, and will be updated annually&#13;
at the end of each calendar year thereafter, with IDA concurrence.&#13;
3.38   To facilitate disbursement, a Special Account to be operated by the Provincial&#13;
Finance Bureau will be established in a bank acceptable to IDA. The Special Account&#13;
will be set up in an arnount of $8 million, the estimated scale of disbursement over a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
four-month period during the early implementation phase. An estimated schedule of&#13;
disbursements is provided in Annex 16.&#13;
1. ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS&#13;
3.39  The county PMOs will maintain separate accounts for all project expenditures.&#13;
These will be consolidated by the prefectural PMOs and submitted annually to the&#13;
provincial PMO. These accounts will be audited annually by independent auditors.&#13;
During negotiations assurances were obtained from the Borrower and Shanxi Province&#13;
that they will cause the project accounts, the Special Account and SOEs to be duly&#13;
audited by an independent auditor acceptable to IDA and will submit them to IDA within&#13;
six months of the close of Leach jinancial year. The State Audit Administration will be&#13;
acceptable for this purpose. In the case of SOEs, the audit report will contain a separate&#13;
opinion by the auditors as to whether SOEs submitted during the financial year, together&#13;
with the procedures and internal controls involved in their preparation, can be relied upon&#13;
to support the related withdrawals.&#13;
J. ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS&#13;
3.40  This is a Category B Project and, overall, the project is expected to have a&#13;
favorable impact. Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) have been prepared by&#13;
each prefecture and these formed the basis for a comprehensive EIA prepared by the&#13;
Shanxi Provincial Institute for Radiation Prevention. This report, prepared in accordance&#13;
with the Bank Group' s recommended format and guidelines for EIAs, finds that the&#13;
project's environmental and social impacts are beneficial and the potentially adverse&#13;
impacts are confined to some of the agroprocessing plants. Mitigation measures are&#13;
described in detail and the report contains detailed proposals for environmental&#13;
management and monitoring. The report was approved by the National Environmental&#13;
Protection Agency (NEPA) and is satisfactory to the Association. During negotiations&#13;
assurances were obtained that Shanxi shall implement the project in accordance with an&#13;
environmental management and monitoring plan acceptable to the Association.&#13;
3.41  Positive environmental effects of the project include:&#13;
(a)   creation of a better environment on a 123,000 ha irrigated area by increasing&#13;
the input of surface water to arrest unsustainable exploitation of&#13;
groundwater;&#13;
(b)   a safer drinking water supply for nearly 700,000 people;&#13;
(c)   modernization of agroprocessing facilities to enhance efficiency and reduce&#13;
pollution;&#13;
(d)   conservation of land and reduction in sediment runoff in parts of Luliang&#13;
prefecture, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
(e)   support for establishment and protection of a nature reserve in Yuncheng&#13;
Prefecture.&#13;
3.42  Social benefits include:&#13;
(a)   lower production costs in the irrigated areas through less reliance on deep&#13;
tubewells;&#13;
(b)   higher farm incomes from horticulture and livestock raising;&#13;
(c)   easier access for villagers in remote areas to markets, medical services,&#13;
schools. and employment opportunities;&#13;
(d)   freedom  from hauling water long distances to allow more productive&#13;
activities: and&#13;
(e)   creation of employment opportunities for several thousand rural poor in the&#13;
processing industry.&#13;
3.43   The sediment control dams will be sited in uninhabited gullies and, therefore, no&#13;
relocation of population will be necessary in the submergence areas. The topography of&#13;
the watersheds allows considerable flexibility in siting the dams, and all will be located at&#13;
sites remote from  existing or potential settlements.  Detailed guidelines for safe&#13;
construction and operation of dams have been prepared, but in the unlikely event of&#13;
failure there would be no danger to life and limited damage to property (see Annex 5).&#13;
The agroprocessing plants will be designed and operated to meet the strict guidelines&#13;
established by NEPA.&#13;
3.44  This project directly targets poor and disadvantaged women through support of&#13;
the ACWF. Women will be the prime beneficiaries of the improved rural water supply&#13;
systems and the livestock component. Not only will the distances to water points be&#13;
dramatically reduced, but reliable water supply allows the household to keep a draft&#13;
animal and small livestock, both directly beneficial to women. In all other components,&#13;
women will be treated on an equal basis with men and the project will endeavor to&#13;
promote their increased representation at all levels of project management. Women are&#13;
fully involved in the agricultural production processes. They will benefit equally from&#13;
the increased production and income resulting from the project.&#13;
K. RESETTLEMENT&#13;
3.45  The components that require land acquisition and relocation of some houses are:&#13;
(a) agroprocessing plants; (b) rural roads; and (c) the Langdian and Zuncun Pumping&#13;
Complexes.&#13;
3.46  Agroprocessing Plants. The agroprocessing plants include expansion of existing&#13;
township enterprises. They are located in various county towns and some will require up&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
to one hectare of land for expansion of facilities. In Yuncheng, six of the 13 plants have&#13;
sufficient land area to complete the expansion without any land acquisition. Five of the&#13;
plants will require land adjacent to the present site, of which one already owns the land&#13;
(0.45 ha), one will acquire the land (0.67 ha), and three will rent the land (2.2 ha in total).&#13;
Two of the plants will build the facilities at new sites which require land acquisition (1.33&#13;
ha in total). In Luliang, four of the eight plants own sufficient land to complete the&#13;
expansion without any new land acquisition. One of the plants will purchase 0.1 hectares&#13;
adjacent to the present site. and three will rent the land (4.3 ha in total). There will be no&#13;
houses affected.&#13;
3.47  Rural Roads. rhe proposed rural road schemes will upgrade existing roads to&#13;
Grade 3 (7.5 m wide). As a result, each road will require the acquisition of a strip of land&#13;
on each side of the existing road. In some areas, the road will be realigned slightly and in&#13;
the mountain passes, new roads will extend where only footpaths existed before. The&#13;
total amount of land acquisition will be 184 ha, of which about 57 ha is farmland, 60 ha is&#13;
slopeland, and 67 ha is wasteland. The widening of roads will affect 84 households that&#13;
will be fully compensated. There will be compensation for the costs involved in moving&#13;
structures, and for the loss of farm land and economic trees owned by farmers. Also, the&#13;
construction of the roads will cause temporary impacts on farmland and these losses will&#13;
be compensated.&#13;
3.48 Langdian and Zuncun Pumping Complexes. The Langdian Complex will&#13;
require the construction of a canal along the beach land parallel to the river. The 13.5 km&#13;
long canal will have an average width of 15 m which will occupy 13.7 ha of wasteland&#13;
within the floodplain. In addition, a 2.6 km section of the canal will be widened to form a&#13;
400 m wide sedimentation basin that will occupy almost 100 ha. The floodplain belongs&#13;
to the YRCC and contains no farms or buildings. The Zuncun Complex will have a&#13;
sedimentation basin that will have a length of 1,400 m, a width of 350 m, and take up 50&#13;
ha of beach land, much of which is presently used as seasonal farmland. Farmers who&#13;
have contracted this land will receive land compensation. No houses or structures will be&#13;
affected. The other components of the Langdian schemes involve improvements to the&#13;
existing pumping stations and canal networks; these will not require any land acquisition.&#13;
Also, the construction of the Langdian scheme may cause minor temporary impacts to&#13;
nearby farmland and these losses will be compensated.&#13;
3.49  Resettlement Action Plan. The principles to be followed for land acquisition are&#13;
based on the Law of Land Management as it is applied at the provincial level. This law&#13;
stipulates the land rights and procedures for establishing compensation. Compensation of&#13;
land, crops, economic trees and houses is based on standard factors and replacement&#13;
value. Some negotiation of rates is typical before the rate is set by local government.&#13;
There is a formal appeals process if the affected party is still dissatisfied. Seasonal&#13;
farmland in the floodplain that has not been contracted, and belongs to the YRCC, is&#13;
typically compensated but at one-half the amount for contracted floodplain land. For the&#13;
land compensation, the funds are allocated to the affected village and the proceeds and/or&#13;
land will be adjusted accordingly. For crops, economic trees and houses, compensation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
will be given to the affected household. The funds can then be used at the discretion of&#13;
the household. If houses are to be demolished, the owner is entitled to salvage any&#13;
materials. The individual will be responsible for the construction of the new house. The&#13;
village will provide support in selecting a new site and assisting with the relocation.&#13;
Each village and household will receive fair compensation and they will then be&#13;
responsible for any relocation or rehabilitation requirements. Since the quantity of land&#13;
involved is small and dispersed amongst several villages, no significant impact on&#13;
livelihoods is anticipated. Any disputes are likely to be resolved at the village or&#13;
township level. During negotiations assurances were obtained that each prefecture will&#13;
implement the Resettlement 4ction Plan agreed with IDA.&#13;
L. CONSULTATION, PARTICIPATION AND TARGETING&#13;
3.50  Public Awareness. The Poverty Alleviation Office has already been financing&#13;
projects for 10 years in Luliang and for four years in five counties of Yuncheng; thus,&#13;
many rural people are quite aware of the general poverty alleviation programs. When&#13;
IDA expressed an interest in supporting poverty alleviation activities, people recognized&#13;
that this would ensure significantly increased funding for the next six years. During the&#13;
process of project preparation-including four IDA and FAO/CP missions conducting&#13;
numerous site visits and two years of field preparation-the prefecture PMOs have&#13;
created widespread awareness of the project. Numerous meetings were held at the&#13;
township and village level to identify candidate villages and households.&#13;
3.51   The public media have been well utilized to increase awareness in the entire&#13;
project area (multiple TV  and radio coverage of preparation activities).   The&#13;
environmental assessment team has conducted an opinion survey of farmers,&#13;
administrators, technicians and intellectuals. The social assessment team has conducted&#13;
pilot surveys of 130 villages in Yuncheng and 70 villages in Luliang. Consequently, the&#13;
level of awareness is high and the local farmers are anxious to see the start of the project.&#13;
Most farrners understand that they will have the obligation to repay part of the village&#13;
investment.&#13;
3.52  Public Consultation. The Poverty Alleviation Office has directly involved all&#13;
relevant line departments, local governments and the beneficiary villages, but they have&#13;
also had consultations with the general public. In March 1994, IDA participated in an&#13;
informal symposium with heads from local democratic political parties, intellectual&#13;
societies, and the ACWF. Although the purpose was to bring diverse groups together to&#13;
become involved with the project, it became clear that all groups had already been&#13;
consulted during the past two years and strongly supported the project. Each group&#13;
described poverty alleviation activities that their members were involved with and some&#13;
expressed an interest to support the implementation of this project.&#13;
3.53  Community Participation. Successful implementation of the project requires a&#13;
high level of community participation. The larger engineering schemes will require labor&#13;
input from  the villagers as their contribution to the project investment.  Proper&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
participation, mobilization, motivation and organization will be required to ensure high&#13;
quality construction and a feeling of ownership in the project. For the livelihood&#13;
improvement schemes, a broader community approach will be taken although typically&#13;
there are few target households in each village. This will provide learning opportunities&#13;
for other villagers and will prepare the ground for future investments using local funds.&#13;
In China, introduction of the household responsibility system has developed more&#13;
individual attitudes amongst the farmers.  Now some blending of entrepreneurial&#13;
initiative and collective support is required for poverty alleviation to extend maximum&#13;
benefits to the greatest number of poor.&#13;
3.54 Targeting and Selection of Project Townships, Villages and Households. This&#13;
project will take a two-pronged approach to the alleviation of poverty. Some components&#13;
will provide direct benefits to targeted villages and households. Other components will&#13;
benefit a large area and large numbers of people. The latter components tend to be&#13;
locationally fixed and include: (a) the Langdian irrigation scheme in Yuncheng; (b) the&#13;
beach land development in Yuncheng; (c) aquaculture improvements in Yuncheng;&#13;
(d) check dams in Luliang; (e) protection forests in Luliang; and (f) agroprocessing.&#13;
3.55  A significant amount of time was spent during preparation to develop realistic&#13;
criteria to target beneficiary villages and poor households for livestock farms,&#13;
horticulture, land terracing, rural roads and rural water supply. Although there is some&#13;
variation among components, criteria typically include income levels, willingness and&#13;
commitment to participate, and availability of natural resources.  The livestock&#13;
component, as an example, includes the development of household farns for cattle or&#13;
sheep/goat raising. Initially some 9,500 households in Yuncheng and 3,100 households&#13;
in Luliang will benefit from this component. It is dispersed widely to virtually all of the&#13;
project area townships in both Yuncheng (194 of 211) and Luliang (117 of 117)&#13;
Prefectures. In Yuncheng, this component will be targeted at poor households in the hilly&#13;
areas (28 percent), in the beach land areas (8 percent), and in the farmland areas (64&#13;
percent-cattle only).  The criteria used to select project villages and beneficiary&#13;
households include:&#13;
* all townships in five poverty counties (83 townships);&#13;
* poor townships in other counties (66 townships);&#13;
* poor villages in other townships (45 townships); and&#13;
* villages that possess good natural resources (e.g., 20 to 40 ha of natural pasture&#13;
and five ha for herbage; or adequate farm residue/fodder).&#13;
Within these villages, between two and 10 households will be identified that:&#13;
* are poor (incomes below Y 500 per capita);&#13;
* have a young adult who completed junior middle school;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
* are capable of good animal husbandry management skills but presently have no&#13;
livestock; and&#13;
*  want to participate in the prograrn.&#13;
The household livestock enterprises will be modest in scale, starting with one cow in the&#13;
first year and purchasing another cow in the second year provided the first year was&#13;
successful. This will ensure that the farmer can manage the livestock enterprise.&#13;
3.56  The Rural Drinking Water Supply component, as another exaznple, includes 78&#13;
water supply schemes to benefit 516 villages in Yuncheng and 204 schemes in Luliang.&#13;
All of the project villages have accepted the proposed schemes and their responsibility to&#13;
collect water fees from each household to repay the capital and operation costs. In&#13;
Yuncheng, the selection of villages focused on two types of conditions: (a) clusters of&#13;
villages in dry areas that could access groundwater by a deep tubewell which will serve&#13;
all villages; and (b) small isolated villages whose needs could be satisfied by nearby&#13;
streams or springs using gravity schemes. Most of the villages were selected from the&#13;
hilly or mountainous areas where access to water is limited. Gravity schemes were&#13;
targeted for villages that either use shallow wells or rainwater collection ponds, which go&#13;
dry for several months of the year. The selected villages are located in 74 townships, of&#13;
which 52 are below the poverty level. In the remaining townships, the selected villages&#13;
are below the poverty level and many have average incomes below Y 350 per capita.&#13;
Annex 12 provides further details.&#13;

4. MANAGEMENT AND ORGANIZATION&#13;
A. PROJECT ORGANIZATION&#13;
4.1   Project Leading Groups. Overall responsibility for the project rests with the&#13;
Shanxi Provincial Government. The planning and subsequent implementation of the&#13;
project is coordinated at the provincial level by a Project Leading Group (PLG), headed&#13;
by the Vice-Govemor responsible for agriculture, and including representatives from all&#13;
the concerned agencies. including the Poverty Alleviation Office, the departments of&#13;
planning, finance, agriculture, water conservancy, forestry, and animal husbandry. The&#13;
Provincial PLG draws on the experience of the World Bank Project Office of the Finance&#13;
Bureau which has considerable experience in dealing with Bank Group projects. At the&#13;
prefectural level, the PLG is headed by the Commissioner of Yuncheng Prefecture and&#13;
the Vice-Commissioner of Luliang Prefecture and has similar representation to that at the&#13;
provincial level. The role of the PLG at each level is to decide on policies and project&#13;
components, and coordinate the work of the relevant departments in preparing and&#13;
subsequently implementing the project. The day-to-day management of the project will&#13;
be handled by the Central Project Management Office (CPMO) which will channel&#13;
provincial and central government funds to the prefectures, operate the Special Account,&#13;
prepare progress reports and withdrawal applications, and supervise procurement in&#13;
cooperation with the ITC. The CPMO will be given the status of a line department&#13;
reporting directly to the Vice Govemor. An assurance was obtained at negotiations that&#13;
Shanxi will prepare and submit a detailed annual budget and work plan to IDA for&#13;
review by November 30 of each year in respect ofproject implementation in the following&#13;
year, and carry out such plans, as approved by the Association.&#13;
4.2   Project Management Offices.  Under the PLG at each level, a Project&#13;
Management Office (PMO) will be responsible for executing the project. The PMOs will&#13;
direct, coordinate and manage the work of the various implementing agencies such as the&#13;
water conservancy, agricultural, and animal husbandry bureaus. Prefecture PMOs will&#13;
(a) draw up annual work programs and budgets; (b) review and approve lower level PMO&#13;
work plans; (c) undertake procurement not covered by the central project office and&#13;
distribute procured materials, (d) prepare and submit to the central PMO detailed project&#13;
accounts, audits and progress reports; (e) undertake project monitoring of physical and&#13;
financial progress and evaluations of project impact; and (f) organize research, local&#13;
training, and project supervision. PMOs at lower levels have been established under the&#13;
county and township administrations with a similar structure and responsibilities. All&#13;
these PMOs have been involved in the detailed preparation of the project and will be&#13;
responsible for all aspects of implementation. The PMOs will supply procured materials&#13;
to fanners in a timely manner and organize irrigation works and terracing in such a way&#13;
that agricultural production suffers minimum disruption. For the livestock component,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
staff will assist farmers in acquiring animals. The township PMOs have been working&#13;
closely with the villagers through village committees in developing project proposals.&#13;
They will continue to play a key role in project implementation through organizing&#13;
collective efforts at the village level which are crucial to the success of the project.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that CPMO and PMOs at prefecture, county&#13;
and township levels would he maintained with terms of references acceptable to IDA and&#13;
staffed by competent staff in adequate numbers.&#13;
4.3   Poverty Alleviation Offices. The PMOs will cooperate closely with the Poverty&#13;
Alleviation Office which has branches at the provincial, prefecture and county levels.&#13;
This office was already responsible for disbursement of funds under the Eight-Seven&#13;
Poverty Alleviation Program. The Poverty Alleviation Office is not a line department,&#13;
but rather a separate agency. that reports directly to the Provincial Planning Commission.&#13;
Its advantage is its ability to coordinate the various line departments all the way down to&#13;
the township level.&#13;
4.4   Village Committees.  The village committee will be the key to physical&#13;
implementation of the livelihood components and will mobilize village labor for the rural&#13;
works components. The village committee is normally comprised of a village chief, a&#13;
deputy, an accountant and a women s representative. Proposals from households to&#13;
participate in the project will first be vetted by the village committees. Only then will&#13;
applications be forwarded to the township office. In some villages the agreement for&#13;
village schemes will be signed by the village committee. For household schemes,&#13;
agreements will be signed by the head of the household, but the village chief will endorse&#13;
the agreement as a guarantor for the household. For project implementation, special&#13;
groups will be formed to manage the mobilization of farmers, organize training, supervise&#13;
construction and control financing. Once completed, the beneficiary households will be&#13;
fully responsible for managing the operation and maintenance of the facilities, and for&#13;
repayments for the livestock as well as paying charges to recover costs associated with&#13;
orchard, agriculture, protection forest, improved pasture, improved terraces, and&#13;
collection well components.&#13;
B. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.5   Flow of Funds.  The Ministry of Finance (MOF) will make available the&#13;
proceeds of the IDA credit to Shanxi Province at an annual interest rate of 3.5 percent&#13;
with a repayment period of 20 years, including a 7-year grace period. The foreign&#13;
exchange risk will be borne by the Shanxi Finance Bureau. A portion of the IDA funds&#13;
will be used directly by CPMO and the prefectures to cover the costs of research,&#13;
training, and equipment expenses. The Finance Bureau will channel the remaining funds&#13;
successively to prefecture, county and township governments. Funds will be made&#13;
available to villages only for activities that have been appraised and approved by the&#13;
PMOs.  According to Chinese practice, contracts will be signed at each level of&#13;
government operation, indicating the terms of availability of funds/equipment. During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained from the Shanxi Provincial Government that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-38 -&#13;
livestock; as well as subloans for agroprocessing and ACWF subprojects, would be made&#13;
available in accordance with procedures, terms and conditions acceptable to the&#13;
Association.&#13;
4.6   Domestic funds, which account for about 45 percent of project costs, will be&#13;
contributed by government loans and grants at provincial, prefecture and county levels, or&#13;
by project beneficiaries who will contribute in cash and/or labor. According to Chinese&#13;
practice, terms and conditions for use of govermment grants will be indicated in contracts&#13;
signed at each level of government and between project beneficiaries and relevant&#13;
governnent agencies.&#13;
4.7   Cost Recovery. Shanxi Province will recover from the prefectures all funds&#13;
disbursed from the proceeds of the IDA Credit and the Poverty Alleviation Fund which in&#13;
total amounts to about 60 percent of the project cost. The prefectures will recover costs&#13;
from the beneficiaries. The village committees will collect funds from farmers, and these&#13;
funds will be channeled through the townships and counties to the prefectures. The fees&#13;
established for cost recovery are realistic and have been deternined based on local&#13;
capacity to pay. The mode of recovery varies among components as described below:&#13;
(a)   ITigation. Farmers are charged according to the volume of water they use.&#13;
The rate of Y 0.3 per cubic meter is sufficient to cover operation and&#13;
maintenance, and loan repayment.  Offices in the townships have the&#13;
responsibility to organize measurement of water use and to collect fees from&#13;
all villages receiving irrigation water. Payments are then passed on to the&#13;
counties and then to the Yuncheng Water Conservation Bureau.&#13;
(b)   Terraces and Check Dams. Farmers will be charged an annual fee of&#13;
Y 300/ha starting three years after terrace completion; this will cover more&#13;
than 50 percent of the cost. The annual fee for land formed behind the check&#13;
dams will be Y 3,000/ha since it is new and highly productive land. The fee&#13;
will be charged from when the land becomes available about 10 years after&#13;
the dams are built.&#13;
(c)   Beach Land. A fee per ha will be charged to the farmers at a level to be&#13;
determined, that will be sufficient to recover 60 percent of the cost.&#13;
(d)   Rural Roads. Tolls will be charged for the project roads since they are&#13;
financed from external sources. The small tolls range from Y 1 to Y 3 per&#13;
vehicle depending on capacity (Annex 6). These tolls are reasonable and&#13;
unlikely to discourage road users.&#13;
(e)   Water Supply. A charge of Y 1.3 per cubic meter will cover O&amp;M and 60&#13;
percent of the cost. In some poor villages in Luliang, the charge may be&#13;
lower and the villages will compensate with free labor on rural works.&#13;
There will also be some direct contribution to the cost of water systems&#13;
through free labor in pipe laying, etc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
(f)    Livestock. Animals will be purchased by the PMOs with the participation&#13;
of selected farmers. The farmers will pay 10 percent of the initial cost. The&#13;
remaining 90 percent of costs will be recovered from the farmers within 5-6&#13;
years from the proceeds of sales of offspring.&#13;
(g)   Horticulture. Fertilizer, pesticides and seedlings will be provided to the&#13;
farmers. Once the farmers have a positive cash flow, charges will be&#13;
imposed to recover 60 percent of all costs other than the farmers' own labor.&#13;
(h)   Agroprocessing. Subloans provided to agroprocessing enterprises will be&#13;
on commercial credit terms in line with comparable loans provided by ABC.&#13;
C. OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE&#13;
4.8   The relevant prefecture and county bureaus will be responsible for ensuring&#13;
adequate maintenance and repair of irrigation works, roads and water supplies. The cost&#13;
will be borne in part by the proceeds of user charges and in part by free labor contributed&#13;
by the beneficiaries. In rural areas, all adults are required to contribute 30 days of free&#13;
labor to communal works. The arrangements described below follow the principles and&#13;
practices already employed on existing facilities in the prefectures.&#13;
(a)    Yuncheng Irrigation System. The pumping stations will be operated and&#13;
maintained by employees of the prefecture and county water conservancy&#13;
bureaus, and will be financed through costs recovered from the&#13;
beneficiaries (para. 4.7). The canals and canal service roads will be&#13;
maintained by the villages and townships they serve with technical and&#13;
financial assistance from the county bureaus for major repairs. The canals&#13;
are all concrete-lined down to the 5 ha service units, so that maintenance&#13;
consist mainly of clearing silt from the canals, and occasional repairs to&#13;
the concrete lining. Canal maintenance will be carried out by the farmers,&#13;
under the village and township leadership, and will be credited to their free&#13;
labor contribution.&#13;
(b)   River Beach Land. Operation and maintenance of the tubewells will be&#13;
the responsibility of the farmers' groups using the wells. Roads will be&#13;
maintained by villages and townships using some free labor. Power lines&#13;
and transformers will be maintained by the county power bureaus.&#13;
(c)    Rural Roads. For maintenance, sections of the roads will be assigned to&#13;
nearby villages and enterprises. They will organize work teams to carry&#13;
out routine maintenance of the road surface, structures and drains on a&#13;
voluntary basis. Improvement and major repairs will be fimded by the&#13;
counties and townships, and work will be assigned to local construction&#13;
teams.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40 -&#13;
(d)   Water Supplies. Materials and replacements will be provided by the&#13;
county water supply bureaus and, where necessary, labor will be supplied&#13;
by the villages.&#13;
D. LAND CONTRACTS&#13;
4.9   The reforms of the late 1970s and early 1980s introduced the household&#13;
responsibility system to China's farmers. Under this system, a household is given use of&#13;
and responsibility for specific plots of land in contrast to the former practice of collective&#13;
farming. The introduction of this system is considered the key to China's successful rural&#13;
reform program that, together with other reforms, has led to the dramatic growth in&#13;
China's agricultural production over the past 15 years. In Shanxi Province, the land&#13;
contract system has been extended beyond crop land to the areas reclaimed by&#13;
afforestation, grasslands and even wastelands. In the areas to be developed under the&#13;
project, farmer households or groups of households will be allotted land under long-term&#13;
contracts which will specify management standards. In return, the farners will have the&#13;
right to fully benefit from the output of the land for which they are responsible. The&#13;
current terms for land contracts have recently been adjusted and are now for a minimum&#13;
of 30 years. Under the project, longer terms for land contracts will be applied in all areas&#13;
covered by the project: a minimum of 50 years for steep waste land; 50 years for forestry&#13;
plots; and 30 years for orchards, terraces and land behind dams. An assurance was&#13;
obtained at negotiations that Shanxi will ensure that the land developed under the&#13;
Project is leased to farmers for terms between 30 years and 50 years under written&#13;
contracts.&#13;
E. MONITORING, EVALUATION, AND ]REPORTING&#13;
4.10   Social Impact Indicators. During project preparation a thorough assessment of&#13;
the likely social impacts of the project was conducted.  In cooperation with the&#13;
preparation team, a logic framework diagram was prepared that shows how the individual&#13;
project components are linked to poverty alleviation (Annex15). There will be direct&#13;
impacts which will be monitored early and indirect impacts which will occur at a later&#13;
stage. The following indicators (gender specific where possible) will be monitored on a&#13;
regular basis:&#13;
(a)   Per capita rural incomes.&#13;
(i)   real increase in incomes;&#13;
(ii)   percentage of households above the poverty line; and&#13;
(iii)   sources of income (income stability).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
(b)   Rural employment:&#13;
(i)   number of labor days created and wages for local farners during&#13;
construction; and&#13;
(ii)   number of people employed in enterprises and salaries&#13;
(the indices will include a gender breakdown).&#13;
(c)   Rural living standards:&#13;
(i)   quality of housing and new house construction; and&#13;
(ii)   household assets (farm machinery and consumer items).&#13;
(d)   Specialized households:&#13;
(i)   household equity and repayment of loans; and&#13;
(ii)   number of defaults or additional loans.&#13;
(e)   Local economic growth:&#13;
(i)   new enterprises and employment in villages and townships;&#13;
(ii)    wage income (full-time, part-time); and&#13;
(iii)   local investment in social infrastructure (schools, clinics).&#13;
4.11  In addition to these indicators, the PMOs will monitor physical and financial&#13;
progress on a regular basis. For each component, the status of project implementation&#13;
will be measured in terms of percent completion of each component, costs, quality, and&#13;
number of people benefited. During negotiations an assurance was obtained from&#13;
Shanxi that it will monitor the Project in accordance with indicators acceptable to the&#13;
Association and prepare and furnish to the Association semi-annual progress reports by&#13;
January 31 and July 31 of each year.&#13;
4.12 Baseline Data and Surveys. The CPMO and the prefecture PMOs will have&#13;
overall responsibility for socioeconomic monitoring and evaluation. Work has already&#13;
commenced to collect and compile baseline data in Yuncheng and Luliang. Income&#13;
statistics and agricultural data have been collected at the county and township levels.&#13;
General statistics on income, living standards, health, education, and agricultural&#13;
production by crop have been compiled for each county. These data will form part of the&#13;
baseline information which will be updated annually with data from the Bureau of&#13;
Statistics.&#13;
4.13  In order to focus on the project villages, it was deemed essential to collect&#13;
additional data using questionnaire surveys. A survey has been designed for the village&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
level to assess the impact of the individual project components on the livelihood of the&#13;
beneficiaries. This information would be gathered annually by a special group under&#13;
contract to the CPMO. A sample size of 180 villages in Yuncheng and 140 villages in&#13;
Luliang would cover 5-6 percent of the project villages. In addition, 60 nonproject&#13;
villages would be surveyed in each prefecture as a control group.&#13;
4.14  The questions in the village survey form are designed to focus on economic and&#13;
social indicators that would be most affected by the project components. The surveys&#13;
have been field tested to ensure that the questions are both relevant and answerable. In&#13;
fact, about two thirds of the data will come from statistics maintained by the village&#13;
administration. This data is not readily obtainable from the county statistics bureau;&#13;
hence, the need for the survey approach.&#13;
4.15  To further validate the village survey information, income data would be collected&#13;
directly from households stratified by region, income group and project component. This&#13;
type of survey would be conducted using a modified survey form. The collection of&#13;
accurate income data at the household level is difficult in China. Many households tend&#13;
to overestimate revenues (e.g., yields and prices), underestimate expenditures, and omit&#13;
important categories of incomes (e.g., sidelines). The poorer families may overestimate&#13;
incomes because they do not include all expenditures. The wealthier families tend to&#13;
under report incomes to avoid taxation. Nonetheless, household surveys can be&#13;
informative when properly conducted, and are sufficiently accurate to demonstrate&#13;
income trends.&#13;
4.16  Data Evaluation and Reporting. Special attention will be given to measuring&#13;
changes in output due to investments in land development and to the new technologies&#13;
introduced by the project. At the same time household investigations will measure the&#13;
impact of the project on household wealth, and access to social services. These data will&#13;
be retained in the project's database, thus allowing close correlation between investments,&#13;
their quality and cost, and their social and economic benefits. Because investments will&#13;
be identified in detail (i.e., it will be possible to define precisely where each site is&#13;
located, the costs incurred, the management practices applied, and annual yield data), it&#13;
will be relatively easy to undertake analysis of different sites and extrapolate the data to&#13;
the project as a whole.&#13;
4.17  The PMOs will require time to set up the monitoring system databases and&#13;
reporting formats. Some training may be required but it is felt that the PMOs possess the&#13;
capability to provide training internally. The system should remain simple and user&#13;
friendly (it will consist of a database, spreadsheet and Geographic Information System&#13;
(GIS) package) to ensure transparency and access by the project supervisory staff.&#13;
4.18  Monitoring Environmental Changes and Benefits.  Both prefectures will&#13;
establish an environmnental monitoring unit. Details of the environmental monitoring&#13;
plan are given in Annex 13. The project will provide additional instrumentation to allow&#13;
effective measurement and collection of data; some automatic measuring devices will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
installed in remote areas. Data from collecting stations will be reinforced by the use of&#13;
satellite imagery and mobile field teams that will undertake special investigations at&#13;
selected sites.&#13;
4.19  Organization and Costs. The CPMO will have overall responsibility to ensure&#13;
that the provinces carry out effective monitoring and that standardized methodologies are&#13;
used. CPMO will prepare annually a monitoring report for the overall project. In the&#13;
prefectures monitoring will be carried out at prefecture, and county levels. Where&#13;
necessary PMOs will contract other agencies and institutions to undertake special studies,&#13;
particularly of sociological and economic impacts. Each year the Monitoring Plan and&#13;
feedback will be reviewed by the CPMO.&#13;
4.20  Project Launch Workshop. IDA and the CPMO will conduct a Project Launch&#13;
Workshop in Shanxi Province in April 1996 for staff of the PMOs at all levels. The&#13;
purpose of the workshop will be to review the program for implementation and to clarify&#13;
tasks and responsibilities at each level.  Topics will include procurement and&#13;
disbursement guidelines and procedures, financial management, supervision, monitoring,&#13;
evaluation and reporting, and other relevant subjects.&#13;
4.21   Supervision and Mid-term Review. A plan for IDA supervision is given in&#13;
Annex 14. CPMO would undertake a mid-term review of the project to assess progress&#13;
and chart remaining implementation and would also prepare an implementation&#13;
completion report for submission to IDA no later than six months following the closing&#13;
date. An assurance was obtainedfrom the government at negotiations that Shanxi would&#13;
furnish the Association with a mid-term report by September 30, 1998.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5. BENEFITS AND JUSTIFICATION&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
5.1   The project will raise incomes and living standards for about 3 million people in&#13;
some of the poorest areas of Yuncheng and Lulling Prefectures in Shanxi Province.&#13;
There will be significant increases in crop production in the 123,000 ha Yuncheng&#13;
Irrigation Project through a more reliable supply of irrigation water, and on 13,000 ha of&#13;
the river beach lands of Yuncheng through irrigation and other works. Water supply&#13;
schemes will provide a safer source of water for nearly 700,000 people, and will relieve&#13;
them from the task of hauling water from long distances so that their time and energy&#13;
may be more productively used. Rural roads will help 355,000 people in remote areas to&#13;
diversify their agricultural production on about 70,000 ha through better access to&#13;
markets and input supply. and enhance employment opportunities and access to social&#13;
services. Expansion of horticulture and livestock raising will offer opportunities for tens&#13;
of thousands of families to raise their incomes. Several thousand women will benefit&#13;
from a program to increase their incomes and provide training. Finally, expansion and&#13;
improvement of agroprocessing facilities will provide more markets for agricultural&#13;
produce and create employment. Total incremental production from project activities is&#13;
summarized in Table 5.1.&#13;
5.2   The project responds to the challenge of providing sustainable improvements in&#13;
the lives of the rural poor in remote areas. Its focus is on measures to raise incomes,&#13;
primarily from crops and livestock. Other important needs of these areas such as health&#13;
and education are not directly addressed, but access to these services and their&#13;
affordability will be enhanced for many of the families affected by the project. Also,&#13;
these services are often being improved by other projects. Each component of the project&#13;
addresses a critical need, has the necessary institutional support and beneficiary&#13;
commitment and, above all, promises a satisfactory return to the farmers and the&#13;
economy.&#13;
B. MARKETS AND PRICES&#13;
5.3   The main crops and other outputs produced by the project are in demand in China&#13;
and this is likely to continue. China is currently importing from 10 to 15 million tons of&#13;
wheat annually. Wheat imports will continue in the future as land under wheat is used for&#13;
higher value crops, or taken up by factories, roads and new housing. In the 1980's, China&#13;
shifted from an importer to an exporter of maize, mainly to South Korea, Japan, and&#13;
Russia. In the long run, China is likely to become again a net importer of maize because&#13;
of the need to meet the rising demand for animal feeds. Domestic cotton production is&#13;
&#13;

regulated by a system of quotas and a relatively low official procurement price. These&#13;
regulations may be relaxed and this might encourage further production gains. But,&#13;
China has recently bought a substantial amount of cotton on the world market and&#13;
imports may become an annual event to meet the needs of the textile and garment trade.&#13;
Outputs from the primary processing component are competitive locally and more than&#13;
half of the products have excellent prospects for export into other provinces or overseas&#13;
markets.&#13;
5.4   The project areas have a comparative advantage in fruit production. The climate&#13;
and soils are well suited to temperate zone fruits, and the farmers are skilled in their&#13;
cultivation as a sideline to grain and cotton production. At current prices, investments in&#13;
fruit trees show an attractive return. Until the fruit trees bear they are intercropped and&#13;
this tends to improve the financial returns. But even if prices should fall in the future,&#13;
fruit trees will still be a significant source of cash income to the poorer farmers. Fruits&#13;
not only provide income, but they also add variety and balance to the farmers' diet. And&#13;
in periods of seasonal drought when grain yields are low, fruit trees will still be&#13;
productive enough to provide cash income and food. In the loess area where much of the&#13;
fruit is grown, there are excellent storage sites in the form of caves; these allow farmers to&#13;
keep fruit for six to eight months without suffering a significant reduction in product&#13;
quality. Thus, there should be no problem in disposing of the project's large volume of&#13;
incremental fruit production&#13;
C. ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSES&#13;
5.5    Approach. Each component has quantifiable benefits that were measured against&#13;
the capital and operating costs.  There are also important benefits that were not&#13;
quantified, but the nature of these are described. Sensitivity tests and switching values&#13;
were derived for all components to judge their economic and financial risks, and the&#13;
impact of changes in prices, costs, or implementation delays.&#13;
5.6   Cropping patterns, yields, and economic crop budgets were estimated for all of the&#13;
main project components for the "without project" and "with project" cases. These were&#13;
used to estimate project benefits for the irrigation, beach land, rural roads, horticulture&#13;
and soil conservation components. Household models were used to derive benefits for&#13;
the livestock component. For the water supply component the economic analysis was&#13;
based on projections of future water use and the villager's willingness to pay for the&#13;
supply of drinking water to the village. The period of analysis for most of the&#13;
components was 20 years. with the exception of the protection forest and the&#13;
agroprocessing component. where it was 35 and 17 years respectively. Operating costs&#13;
for Yuncheng Irrigation. the beach land and the water supply component include&#13;
pumping costs, maintenance and replacement of pumps and other equipment, and&#13;
personnel.&#13;
5.7   Economic prices in 1995 constant terms were calculated for all traded inputs and&#13;
outputs based on the World Bank's price projections. For nontraded goods the economic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
prices are the local market prices (Annex 1). Economic rates of return (ERRs) for all&#13;
project components and for the project as a whole are summarized in Table 5.2. The&#13;
analyses are briefly described below and supporting tables are given in each of the&#13;
technical Annexes.&#13;
5.8   Yuncheng Irrigation System.  The Langdian Pumping Complex and the&#13;
completion of the Yuncheng Irrigation System to serve an area of 123,000 ha has an ERR&#13;
of 40 percent. This high return is due to the large sunk cost and the low investment cost&#13;
per hectare. The benefits arise largely from providing a full supply of irrigation water to&#13;
lands that are presently rainfed and partly irrigated. As a result of the project works,&#13;
Yuncheng will be able to resume using the volume of water allocated to the project by the&#13;
Yellow River Conservancv Commission in the 1970's. It might be argued that areas in&#13;
the lower reaches of the Yellow River will in future be deprived of water once the&#13;
diversion capacity of Yuncheng is restored. This would be true only when the divertible&#13;
flow is zero at projects in the lower reaches; a situation that might arise for short periods&#13;
in May and early June. But, in such a situation, the flow at Langdian might be as low as&#13;
100 cubic meters per second, and much of this would be lost through seepage and&#13;
evaporation before reaching the downstream projects. Thus, it can be assumed that the&#13;
opportunity cost of the water diverted at Langdian in the low flow period would be too&#13;
small to have a material effect on the ERR.&#13;
5.9   Soil and Water Conservation Works. The conversion of slope land to terraces&#13;
conserves moisture for crop growth. It is now well established that this doubles yields&#13;
and leads to a shift towards maize from the lower value grains. The main crops grown in&#13;
Luliang on the terraces will be maize, potatoes, soybean, and some millet and sorghum&#13;
for domestic use. Crop models have been prepared for these crops (Annaxu5). They are&#13;
aggregated into an area model reflecting the change in the cropping pattern. The ERR of&#13;
18 percent is based on cropping benefits only. Benefits due to the reduction of sediment&#13;
load in the downstream river system have been included in the analysis.&#13;
5.10  The 56 check dams proposed for construction under the project will retain a&#13;
sediment load of 1.8 million tons annually. The analysis uses the sediment retention&#13;
benefit of Y I per ton of silt derived for the IDA-financed Loess Plateau Watershed&#13;
Rehabilitation Project. The land created behind the dams will be fertile and will be used&#13;
for crop production. It is expected that up to 270 ha will be available for cropping of&#13;
mainly maize, sorghum and sunflowers. Economic crop budgets have been prepared for&#13;
these. The annual incremental net value of crop production in Year 10 will reach&#13;
Y 787,000, and the ERR is 14 percent (Table 5, Annex 5).&#13;
5.11  The afforestation of 4,200 ha of steep slopes has direct benefits from forest&#13;
products and indirect benefits ranging from erosion control and downstream damage&#13;
prevention. Economic crop budgets show that the long-tenn benefits from timber and the&#13;
medium-tenn benefits from poles and firewood generate an ERR of 13 percent (Annex 5,&#13;
Table 12).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
5.12 River Beach Land. The provision of irrigation, land leveling, roads, and&#13;
electrification will lead to irrigation of 16,000 ha of land that is now rainfed. This will&#13;
raise the cropping intensity from 100 percent to 115 percent and more than double yields&#13;
of wheat, maize, cotton, soybean, and groundnut. Improvement of 330 ha of existing&#13;
ponds and construction of 200 ha of new fish ponds will increase fish production by&#13;
2,500 ton per year. For this component all investment costs are weighed against benefits&#13;
expected from gains in crop and fish production. These are the main economic activities&#13;
in this area and will benefit most from the proposed improvements in basic infrastructure.&#13;
The model does not measure benefits from livestock and timber production, which are&#13;
difficult to estimate but could be significant. The ERR of 29 percent for this component&#13;
also reflects the sunk cost of past development, mainly in the form river training, land&#13;
clearing and rough land leveling.&#13;
5.13 Rural Roads. Approximately 355,000 people living in remote upland areas will&#13;
directly benefit from the improvement of rural roads. The benefits will consist of&#13;
(a) transport cost savings which in turn will lead to lower prices for farm inputs and&#13;
higher farmgate prices, (b) higher production efficiency expressed in higher yields due to&#13;
a better and more timely availability of inputs and a reduction of post harvest storage and&#13;
transportation losses, and (c) stimulation of economic development, because of a wider&#13;
choices for diversification and production of higher value products. All economic sectors&#13;
will benefit from the proposed roads, but the economic analysis is based only on the&#13;
agricultural benefits. Economic crop budgets have been estimated for two representative&#13;
roads in Luliang and Yuncheng. These show separately the benefits from transport cost&#13;
reduction and from the expected yield improvements (Ann=&amp;). The ERR for the road in&#13;
Luliang was found to be 37 percent, the ERR for the Yuncheng road was 22 percent. The&#13;
weighted average rate of return for the road component is estimated at 25 percent. This&#13;
rate of return does not include other benefits which could be significant. Some of the&#13;
roads serve small-scale mining operations, others are important for transit traffic. In all&#13;
cases there will be benefits in the growth of small enterprises, access to schools,&#13;
extension services, health care, and off-farm employment.&#13;
5.14 Rural Water Supply. The economic justification of the rural water supply&#13;
component is based on the peoples' willingness to pay. In villages in Yuncheng, without&#13;
access to drinking water, and where the water is transported in tanks towed by farm&#13;
tractors, people pay up to Y 10-13 per cubic meter. A typical family spends about Y 100&#13;
to Y 130 per family for drinking water during the dry season when their rain water tanks&#13;
dry up. This is a reasonable measure of the upper limit of peoples' willingness to pay. In&#13;
villages with existing water supply systems the people pay between Y 1.5 and Y 2.5 per&#13;
cubic meter and spend about Y 30 to Y 40 per family in a year. For the benefit&#13;
calculation, the lower value of Y 1.5 per cubic meter is used as an average figure for the&#13;
willingness to pay. This is a conservative estimate, since the observed value of Y 1.5 is a&#13;
marginal value and many people would be willing to pay higher prices particularly for&#13;
smaller amounts of water as the situation in Yuncheng shows. On this basis, the rural&#13;
water supply component was found to generate an ERR of 22 percent (Annr x7).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
5.15 An alternative measurement of the benefits has been tested, based on the fact that&#13;
people spend a substantial share of their time in collecting and hauling water. At many of&#13;
the open wells there is a long waiting time for the well to recharge after each villager&#13;
takes his or her share. It is assumed that 40 percent of the population are economically&#13;
active and spend about 10 percent of their time hauling water. The distance to the water&#13;
source in many locations in Yuncheng is between 3 and 5 kilometers and, particularly in&#13;
Luliang, there is also often a difference in height of 100 to 200 meters between the village&#13;
and the water source. If the time for collecting water is conservatively valued at Y 2.5&#13;
per day, the time saved amounts to about Y 25 million annually and the ERR is 23&#13;
percent. This is close to the ERR based on willingness to pay.&#13;
5.16  Horticulture. Individual fruit and nut tree models on a per hectare basis are&#13;
shown in Annex 9. The individual ERRs range from 22 to 33 percent. An aggregated&#13;
area model has been built to show the economic results for entire investment. The&#13;
weighted ERR is 26 percent. A sensitivity analysis was made to test the economic results&#13;
for a drop in fruit and nuts sales prices and an increase in labor costs if off-farm&#13;
employment opportunities would become more attractive. A drop in sales prices by 50&#13;
percent would bring the ERR down to 12 percent, while increased labor costs by 50&#13;
percent would drop the ERR from 26 percent to 17 percent.&#13;
5.17  Livestock  The introduction of cattle to farmers in the project area will allow&#13;
them to generate income from a surplus of feed resources. In the plain areas of Yuncheng&#13;
there are large amounts of wheat straw and maize stover as byproducts from the cropping&#13;
activities, and in the hilly areas in both prefectures there are unused resources of natural&#13;
pasture and byproducts which can best be exploited by large ruminants. A farm model&#13;
has been prepared to estimate the likely financial and economic results of the introduction&#13;
of livestock in the farm operation (Anac&amp;J). To minimize the risk to the individual&#13;
farmer the investment package will be designed to introduce only two breeding animals&#13;
as an additional farming activity and costs will be kept to a minimum. The participating&#13;
farmer will take credit only for the purchase of two breeding cattle or heifers. The&#13;
construction of shelter, silage pits, water tanks and some fencing will be low cost and&#13;
done with household labor. On this basis the farmer will be able to pay back the initial&#13;
credit for the breeding animals from the sale of the offspring within six years and he will&#13;
have a cash surplus -even during this repayment period-of about Y 490 per year to&#13;
supplement his household income.&#13;
5.18  After repayment, the annual net income from this livestock operation will be&#13;
about Y 1,800, which represents a return to labor of Y 37 per day. The ERR is estimated&#13;
to be 20 percent and includes all investment in support services such as artificial&#13;
insemination centers and veterinary services. Functioning support services are critical to&#13;
the success of the livestock component. Sensitivity analysis shows that a drop in the&#13;
fertility rate from 70 to 60 percent (from poor insemination practice and/or poor health&#13;
standards and calf death), will reduce the ERR from 20 to 14 percent. The support&#13;
services financed by the project will serve farmers outside of the project, but these&#13;
benefits have not been included in the economic analysis.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
5.19 Agroprocessing. A financial analysis has been carried out for the agroprocessing&#13;
enterprises in the project (Annex I l). The weighted average financial rate of return is 28&#13;
percent and ranges from 18 percent for the Xiaxian Flour Mill to 45 percent for the&#13;
Wenxi Biscuit Factory. Most of the factories break even between Year 6 and Year 8.&#13;
5.20  Three sensitivity scenarios have been modeled for each factory: (a) a drop in the&#13;
sales prices of 5 percent; (b) a drop in prices of 10 percent; and (c) a reduction in the&#13;
production capacity by 20 percent. The financial parameters of some of the factories are&#13;
sensitive to a drop in the sales prices. Particularly affected are those factories with low&#13;
fixed costs and high turnovers operating with small margins. However, these type of&#13;
enterprises would generally compensate by paying lower prices to their suppliers of raw&#13;
material. All of the factories would still be financially viable under a reduced capacity of&#13;
20 percent. However, the Xiaxian Flour Mill would be just at the margin with a FRR of&#13;
12 percent. Most other factories could economically operate at even lower capacity.&#13;
5.21   An expansion of the agroprocessing activities in the project area will lead to a&#13;
number of important economic benefits. Processing generally doubles or triples the value&#13;
of agricultural raw materials and a large share of this additional value would be kept&#13;
within the region in the form of employment and income. Processing of perishable&#13;
agricultural raw materials such as fruits and vegetables close to the place of production&#13;
reduces significantly postharvest storage and transportation losses. For all products,&#13;
transportation requirements are reduced and become less time-bound. This is an&#13;
important factor in rural China where the transportation system is heavily loaded.&#13;
5.22 Total Project ERR. The total ERR for the project including all costs and&#13;
quantifiable benefits is estimated at 28 percent.&#13;
5.23  Sensitivity Analysis. Sensitivity of the ERRs for the project components has&#13;
been tested for cost overruns, increased input costs and shortfalls in output. Table 5.2&#13;
indicates that all components are economically viable. With the exception of the&#13;
sediment control dams, this would not change if investment costs increase by 10 percent,&#13;
or benefits decrease by 10 percent, or the benefit is delayed by two years, or a combined&#13;
cost increase and benefit decrease by 10 percent. Switching values for cost overruns&#13;
range from 1 10 percent for check dams to 550 percent for the horticulture component.&#13;
More specific sensitivity scenarios, for example a 50 percent drop in fruit prices for the&#13;
horticulture component or severe flood damage for the Langdian water intake, have been&#13;
modeled for each individual component (details are shown in the Annexes). None of&#13;
these variants reduced the combined ERR of the components below acceptable levels. In&#13;
fact, a worst case scenario, a major shift of the Yellow River channel away from the&#13;
pumps at Langdian within five years of completion, would only lower the ERR of this&#13;
component to 17 percent.&#13;

5.24  Incomes. The incremental incomes for typical beneficiaries of the project are&#13;
summarized below. These are after payment of agricultural taxes, special goods tax, land&#13;
rent and loan repayment (16-20 percent of household expenditure). The project would&#13;
add 50 to 100 percent to the farm incomes of project participants.&#13;

5.25  Financial Analysis. For most of the components, financial analyses are of&#13;
limited value. Normally such analyses are done to test the financial attractiveness of the&#13;
farrning opportunities offered by the project. In this case, there is ample evidence in the&#13;
field that farmers are willing to grow irrigated crops, plant fruit trees, and take advantage&#13;
of land development works. In effect the project creates opportunities that precedent&#13;
shows are clearly attractive to farmners. The livestock component raises issues of&#13;
financial viability which were examined in the course of appraisal. A financial analysis&#13;
of a typical livestock operations is shown in Annex 8, and financial analyses have been&#13;
prepared for the individual agroprocessing enterprises (Ame2J1 1).&#13;
D. PROJECT RISKS&#13;
5.26  The project will be executed by local government units that have a good record in&#13;
implementing agricultural and rural development projects. Notably successful have been&#13;
Shanxi's components of the Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation Project, and the&#13;
WFP 3923 Project in Luliang Prefecture. Two components of the project present some&#13;
elements of risk, the Langdian Pumping Complex and the livestock component. The&#13;
channel configuration of the Yellow River at the Langdian site appears to be stable, but&#13;
this might change suddenly in the afterrnath of an extreme flood or through gradual&#13;
changes in the river's morphology. The use of three different water intakes at the new&#13;
Langdian Pumping Station significantly reduces this risk. It is also to be noted that the&#13;
discounted net agricultural benefits of the Langdian complex will exceed the cost of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
complex after three years of operation.  The livestock component will introduce&#13;
thousands of farmers to livestock ownership.  This will call for careful selection,&#13;
intensive training, and monitoring of the beneficiaries, all of which are supported under&#13;
the project.&#13;

ANNEX 3: YUNCHENG IRRIGATION SYSTEM&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    The Yuncheng Irrigation System (YIS), in the southwest corner of Yuncheng Prefecture,&#13;
has three main units. The two smaller units Jiamakou (18,400 ha) and Xiaofan (11,600 ha),&#13;
supplied by pumping stations on the Yellow River were begun in the early 1960's and gradually&#13;
developed through the 1970s. In 1969, the river veered away from the site of the Xiaofan station&#13;
and in 1976 this also happened at the site of the Jiamakou station. Construction of Zuncun, the&#13;
third and largest unit was begun in the mid-1970, with the aim of serving an area of 123,000 ha.&#13;
This area was also supplied by a pumping station on the Yellow River built in 1978, but in 1987 the&#13;
channel shifted several kilometers away from the intake. Because of the channel shift a decision&#13;
was taken to delay the completion of the Zuncun system. The project will restore the pumping&#13;
capacity for the three units and carry out works needed to complete the remaining 93,000 ha of the&#13;
Zuncun unit. Cost estimates for this components are shown in Table 1.&#13;
Project Works&#13;
New Pumping Facilities&#13;
2.    The Langdian Pumping Complex will increase the supply of water to the YIS. Three&#13;
pumping stations were built to lift water from the Yellow River to this system. But the river&#13;
channel, which was close to the left bank when the pumping stations were built, has moved away&#13;
from the river bank. Now, everv year. channels are excavated from the active channel to the pumps&#13;
but these fill with sediment when the river is in flood, and sometimes the channels have to be&#13;
excavated several times a year during the flood season. The details of the pumping stations are&#13;
summarized below:&#13;

The current delivery capacity is only 22 cms compared to the design capacity of 62 cms. This&#13;
problem is to be overcome by building the new Langdian pumping station upstream of the three&#13;
existing stations and connecting it to them through a desilting basin and a 13.5 km canal. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -                  ANNEX3&#13;
capacity of the pumping station will be 45 cms with a lift of 4 m. In addition, floating pumps with a&#13;
capacity of 18 cms will be placed near the Zuncun station. A 1.5 km long channel between the river&#13;
and the Zuncun station will require annual maintenance dredging.&#13;
Siting of the Langdian Station&#13;
3.    The Langdian pumping station and river intakes station are at a point in the river where the&#13;
channel is close to the left bank and is believed to be stable. Satellite images show that the site has&#13;
been free from sediment accretion since 1980. the date of the earliest images. During this period,&#13;
flow patterns were tracked on the river and these show that the bulk of the flow stayed close to the&#13;
left bank, except in 1984. In that year. the main flow shifted away but pumping would still have&#13;
been possible at the proposed site. Local people at the site report that the channel has been stable in&#13;
its present location for more than 30 years. From a review of all the available data, a team of river&#13;
training experts from the Yellow River Conservancy Commission (YRCC) has concluded that the&#13;
river channel at the site is stable and is likely to remain so.&#13;
4.   In March 1995, a nrver training expert, Mr. Max Lamnb, was retained by the Bank to review&#13;
the siting of the Langdian Station. He reviewed the satellite images and other data and carried out a&#13;
detailed inspection of the river reach on the left and right bank of the Yellow River, upstream and&#13;
downstream of the project. His conclusions were in line with those of the YRCC experts. He&#13;
recommended that the channel configuration be closely monitored to detect any trends that might&#13;
lead to a channel shift. He also outlined a proposal for the location and design of a low spur that&#13;
could be built at a cost of around Y 6 million if the channel should start to migrate. The dredges in&#13;
the desilting basin (see below) will be available in the dry season if it becomes necessary to widen&#13;
or deepened the approach to the Langdian station.&#13;
5.    Following the March 1995 mission, experts from the YRCC and the Shanxi Provincial&#13;
Water Resource Bureau met with the Yuncheng engineers to discuss further various alternatives of&#13;
the layout of the pumping station and intakes. This meeting led to agreement on a plan in which&#13;
the main intake gate will be at the original site for the pumping station, but the pump house will be&#13;
located in the feeder canal about one kilometer downstream. A second intake will be placed&#13;
between the main intake and the pump house. This would be operated if the bend in the main&#13;
channel migrates downstream. A third option, if there is a further channel shift, would be to create&#13;
an opening through the channel bank at the punp house. This multiple intake proposal adds&#13;
flexibility to accommodate possible channel shifts in the future. The preappraisal mission had&#13;
suggested that the need for river bank protection extending three kilometers upstream of the&#13;
Langdian intake be reviewed. The YRCC team concluded that this protection will help to stabilize&#13;
the river channel upstream of the intakes.&#13;
Langdian Delivery Channel and Desilting Basins&#13;
6.    A 13.5 km long delivery channel, I I m wide and 2 m deep will link the Langdian Complex&#13;
to the Jiamakou, Xiaofan and Zuncun pumping stations. The channel will carry a road on the IO m&#13;
crest of the riverside embankment. The embankment will have a protective surface of hand-placed&#13;
rock to guard against erosion during high floods in the Yellow River. During high floods, the&#13;
Yellow River carries the highest sediment of any of the world's large rivers. At high sediment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -                   ANNEX3&#13;
concentrations the Langdian pumping station will close down, but the pumps will be operated when&#13;
sediment loads reach I to 2 percent of the flow. Each of the three main pumping stations will have&#13;
its own sediment basin. When the sediment load is low, control gates will divert water directly&#13;
from the feeder canal to the pumping stations. When the sediment load is high, water will first pass&#13;
through the sediment basins.&#13;
7.    In the flood months of July and August the irrigation demands are relatively low and the&#13;
pumps will operate at less than half capacity. The total sediment load in these months will be&#13;
about 1.5 million tons. About 50 percent of this will be removed by the sediment basins. The&#13;
capacities of the sediment basins are 2, 6.4 and 42 million cubic meters respectively for Xiaofan,&#13;
Jiamakou, and Zuncun. The basin at Xiaofan will have a life of 15 years before it will have to be&#13;
enlarged, and the other two have lives of more than 50 years. Dredges will be placed in each&#13;
basin to remove sediment deposit that might obstruct the intake to the pumps. These will be&#13;
80 m /hour dredges that can be assembled at the site which is accessible only by a narrow road.&#13;
These dredges will also be available, if needed, to clear the approach to the Langdian pumping&#13;
station.&#13;
Zuncun Pumps&#13;
8.    A shallow distributarv channel of the Yellow River is within 1.5 km of the main Zuncun&#13;
pumping station. During the drv season this is dammed with an earth dam and a connecting&#13;
channel is excavated to the pumping station, or in some years simply re-excavated, by amphibious&#13;
excavators. In the dry season the water level in the river is low and the most that can be extracted&#13;
by gravity flow is 15 cms, and at times much less. The plan for the project is to pump water into&#13;
the connecting channel from the distributary channel using a battery of floating pumps with a total&#13;
capacity of 18 cms. The main Zuncun pumping station will discharge into the sediment basin or&#13;
the feeder canal, depending on sediment conditions.&#13;
The Irrigation Units&#13;
9.    Details of the three irrgation units making up the Yuncheng Irrigation System are given in&#13;
Table 2 which shows technical parameters and operating costs. The main, branch and lateral canals&#13;
for the Jiamakou and Xiaofan units are essentially complete but before the pumping stations&#13;
resume operation some clearing of sediment and general repairs will be carried out. Works&#13;
required for the Zuncun unit consist of:&#13;
(a)   completion of the main pumping station for Stage 9 (8,000 ha);&#13;
(b)   construction of four pumping stations for branch canals served by Stage 9;&#13;
(c)   construction of branch canals for Stage 9; and&#13;
(d)   construction of laterals for Stages 1-9.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -                   ANNEX3&#13;
In the YIS below the main canals and branch canal, the laterals serve areas of about 60 ha. All canals&#13;
including the laterals are concrete-lined. Below the laterals, unlined sublaterals serve 5 ha within&#13;
which the farmers construct their field channels.&#13;
Crop Production&#13;
10.   The YIS is generally 60 to 80 m above the Yellow River, but parts of the Zuncun unit are at&#13;
higher elevations and require further lifts up to 100 m. The area has the "gullied plateau" landform&#13;
of the Loess Plateau. The soils are deep and fertile. The main crops grown are wheat, maize and&#13;
other grains, soybeans and other oilseeds. cotton, and vegetables. Double cropping is possible with&#13;
wheat followed by maize and some other grain crops. Cotton cannot be combined with another&#13;
crop in the sarne crop year because it is planted too early and harvested too late. The cropping&#13;
intensity is about 105 percent. In recent years greenhouse production of fruit and vegetables has&#13;
grown rapidly. Interplanting of Chinese dates, walnuts, apple and pears is a common practice. The&#13;
average farm size is about 0.6 ha.. About 40,000 ha of the area is fully irrigated, 37,000 ha is partly&#13;
irrigated, and 43,000 ha is rainfed. Irrigation is mainly from tubewells. Crops, cropping patterns&#13;
and yields for the 'with' and 'without project' scenarios are shown in Table 3.&#13;
Water Supply&#13;
11.   An estimate of the water requirements at the pumping stations for the YIS when developed&#13;
for 123,000 ha is shown in Table 3 A. At present the delivery capacity of the pumping stations is&#13;
less than 22 cms, which is much less than the demand for the 87,000 ha that is now irrigated. In&#13;
fact, in some months in the flood season, the pumps are shut down because of silting in the supply&#13;
channels excavated from the river. Most of the irrigation water at present comes from tubewells.&#13;
The groundwater in the YIS has been depleted over the past 20 years. There are three aquifers.&#13;
The shallow aquifer from 10-50 m is low yielding and wells produce 2-5 m3/hour, but in many&#13;
places the aquifer has been effectively dewatered. A middle aquifer at 50-100 m is somewhat&#13;
higher yielding but generally the low yields do not justify deep wells. The deep aquifer at 150-320&#13;
m used to be highly productive and in most areas it was artesian, but overuse has reduced the&#13;
pressure to 200 m below ground level. and most of the operating wells in the YIS are deep wells&#13;
with lifts of over 200 m. There is evidence that the deep aquifer will respond to a reduction in&#13;
pumping. In 1984 and 1985, the rains were timely and adequate for most of the growing season&#13;
and there was a sharp drop in pumping. In one year the pressure in the deep aquifer rose over 10 m.&#13;
Thus the project is expected to help restore the groundwater resource. However, the tubewells will&#13;
continue to be used temporarily when the pumps are shut down to avoid excessive sediment inflow&#13;
during floods.&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
12.   The completion of the Yuncheng Irrigation System (YIS) will ensure an adequate water&#13;
supply for irrigation of 123,000 ha of highly fertile crop land. The benefits arise largely from&#13;
tuming rainfed and partly irrigated land into fully irrigated agricultural production. This will lead&#13;
to an increase in the cropping intensity for the total area from 105 percent to 120 percent and will&#13;
increase yields of wheat, cotton, maize and apples. The annual incremental agricultural output will&#13;
be 126,000 tons of wheat, 87,000 tons of maize, 10,000 tons of cotton lint, and 79,000 tons of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -                    ANNEX3&#13;
apples. This will create an additional annual net income of Y 384 million for the farming&#13;
population of about 750,000 in the area, and will raise their average annual per capita income from&#13;
Y 450 to almost Y 1,000.&#13;
13.   The farmers in the area have a long experience with irrigation, and will readily achieve the&#13;
change from rainfed to irrigated production. The crop budgets used to estimate the project benefits&#13;
are based on differences in yields and inputs observed on rainfed, partly irrigated and fully irrigated&#13;
fields in many places in the area (see Table 4). There is therefore a solid basis for the expected&#13;
response of the farmers to the availability of irrigation.&#13;
14.   The high ERR of 40 percent for this component reflects the large sunk cost of past&#13;
development. The irrigation infrastructure is already largely in place, and a number of existing&#13;
pumping stations are functional or need only small investment for rehabilitation. The water&#13;
distribution infrastructure from the main canals down to the field level is in place over much of the&#13;
area and the fields are levelled and ready for irrigation. The project completes some missing&#13;
sections of the water distribution system.&#13;
15.   The expected benefits are large enough to pay back all investment costs by the third year of&#13;
operation (Table 6). A 50 percent increase in costs would still result in an ERR of 31 percent. The&#13;
major uncertainty relates to the water intake from the Yellow River. Three different intake points&#13;
plus the floating pumps at Zuncun minimize the risk that a channel shift could deprive the system&#13;
of water. A sensitivity analysis shows that a worst case scenario, a major shift of the river channel&#13;
away from the pumps five years after completion, would only lower the ERR to 17 percent.&#13;

ANNEX 4: RIVER BEACH LAND&#13;
Project Works&#13;
1.    River beach land has been formed by deposition of Yellow River sediments. Until the&#13;
creation of the PRC, the course of the Yellow River was virtually uncontrolled, and beachland&#13;
was scoured and deposited unpredictably over a cycle of 20 to 30 years. Over the past 20 years&#13;
some of the more stable areas of beach land have been protected by river training works and now&#13;
about 58,000 ha of land bordering the left bank of the Yellow River in Yuncheng Prefecture is&#13;
recognized by the local authorities as river beach land. The beach land is found in eight of the&#13;
poorest counties of Yuncheng, and four of these are listed as national poverty counties. The land&#13;
is in narrow strips, 2-8 km wide, scattered along a river length of 345 km where the river forms&#13;
the westem and southem borders of the prefecture. About 32,000 ha has been developed for crop&#13;
production and forest plantations, and much of the remainder is sporadically farmed. The main&#13;
crops are wheat, maize, groundnuts, soybean, and small areas of cotton. Virtually all of the crops&#13;
are rainfed. The main forest species is pawlonia. Rainfall ranges from 500 mmn in the north to&#13;
600 mm in the south. The shallow groundwater aquifer is productive with yields around 10 m3/&#13;
hour, but it has not been widely exploited because of poor road access and lack of a power&#13;
distribution system.&#13;
2.    The project will develop 13,000 ha of land within the eight counties. Irrigation will be&#13;
provided by 1,300 wells (one well for 10 ha.), and around 1,300 km of concrete lined irrigation&#13;
channels will be built. Typical wells are 30 m deep and use the traditional concrete casing and&#13;
porous concrete screens with a submersible pump. Township and village enterprises are skilled in&#13;
drilling and installing such wells. The area will be connected to the existing power system by 110&#13;
kv transmission lines. Other power facilities will include 110 kv, 35 kv and 10 kv power lines with&#13;
associated transformers and switch gear. About 175 km of roads will be built to the Fourth Grade&#13;
Rural standard. The road bed will be about 50 cm of compacted earth with a 5 m wide&#13;
lime-stabilised surface, with I m shoulders. Aquaculture has been profitable in the area and,&#13;
therefore, the project will include 200 ha of new ponds and improvement of 330 ha of existing&#13;
ponds. Cost estimates are shown in Table 1.&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
3.    Crop budgets and cropping patterns with and without the project are shown in Tables 2-4.&#13;
The project will raise the cropping intensity from 100 percent to I IS percent and more than double&#13;
yields of wheat, cotton, soybean, and groundnuts. Irrigation will also lead to production of&#13;
high-value crops such as vegetables, and fruit crops such as water melons. All investment costs&#13;
including Y 4.8 million for 5 km of bank protection and Y 1 million for the preservation of a&#13;
migratory bird reserve are weighted against benefits expected from improved cropping and fish&#13;
production. Crops and aquaculture are the main sources of benefits. However, there will be&#13;

benefits for the livestock and timber production in the area, that are not quantified. The ERR of 29&#13;
percent for the component (Table 6) reflects sunk costs of past development, mainly in the form of&#13;
land clearing, rough land levelling and dirt roads.&#13;

ANNEX 5: LAND DEVELOPMENT AND EROSION CONTROL&#13;
Background&#13;
1. Since the creation of the PRC there have been several campaigns in the Loess Plateau,&#13;
especially in the 1970s, involving terracing, afforestation, and silt control dams. In the past, the&#13;
purpose of these measures was seen mainly as soil conservation and little attention was given by&#13;
planners or farmers to maximizing production and incomes. The liberalization of the agriculture&#13;
sector in the 1 980s and the growth of a free market has given farmers more incentives to exploit the&#13;
resources of the plateau.  While individual efforts are now rewarded by the market, the&#13;
development of the Loess Plateau calls for carefully organized, collective efforts to cope with the&#13;
highly complex land forms and land capabilities, and the small area of arable land (about 0.5 ha)&#13;
available to a farm family. Thus, a new element that has been introduced in recent years is the&#13;
comprehensive and integrated planning of individual watersheds. The objectives are to create&#13;
sustainable production of field crops and orchards on high-yielding level farmland, and reduce the&#13;
area of erodible slope lands devoted to crops. The slope lands are then planted to a range of trees,&#13;
shrubs and grasses to produce fuel, timber and fodder. While the area devoted to crops is reduced&#13;
the overall output value per hectare is significantly increased. The watershed is the basic physical&#13;
unit and the village is the basic social unit. The success of this integrated approach depends on&#13;
close consultation between the planners and the village leaders and villagers. In recent years, this&#13;
approach has been successfully implemented on a large scale in a number of watersheds in the&#13;
plateau, and it has proved to be sustainable. In Luliang Province, the following soil and water&#13;
conservation measures will be implemented as part of the project:&#13;
(a)   terracing of 13,400 ha;&#13;
(b)   construction of 56 sediment control dams; and&#13;
(c)   afforestation of 4,200 ha of slope lands.&#13;
Terraces&#13;
2.    The conversion of slope lands to terraces serves a number of purposes. First, it creates a&#13;
better environment for crop production through moisture conservation; in a year of average rainfall,&#13;
grain yields on terraces are two to three times higher than on slope lands. Second, terraced land is&#13;
more resistant to damaging soil erosion during intense storms than slope land. And third, sediment&#13;
runoff is much lower from terraces than from sloped land. Generally, terraces are confined to lands&#13;
where slopes are less than 200, but where there is a shortage of crop land, terraces are built on&#13;
slopes up to 25°. Soils are deep in Luliang and the area is therefore well suited to terracing, but the&#13;
topsoil is often set aside and replaced upon completion of the terrace. About 7,600 ha will be wide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-90-                     ANNEX5&#13;
terraces of 13-16 m built on slopes of 5°-10O and 5,800 ha will be narrower terraces of 10-13m built&#13;
on slopes of 10°-15°. The terraces will be level and the lower parts of the risers vertical, with a&#13;
sloping top to allow for establishment of grasses and other vegetative cover plants to protect the&#13;
riser from erosion. After terracing, the fields will be deep plowed, fertilized with 150 kg of urea&#13;
and 300 kg of single superphosphate. The main crops will be sorghum, maize, millet, beans,&#13;
potatoes and sunflower. A cost estimate for terracing is shown in Table 1.&#13;
Sediment Control Dams&#13;
3.    The project includes the construction of 56 sediment control dams. These are earth dams&#13;
with heights between 10 and 25 meters built in the steep-sided gullies typical of the loess plateau.&#13;
Gross initial storage capacities range between 100,000 m3 and 1,000,000 m3. Numerous similar&#13;
dams have been built in Luliang. The dams reduce flooding and sediment loads in the downstream&#13;
rivers, and the sediment deposits behind the dams create high quality agricultural land, in this case&#13;
about 270 ha. The water stored behind the dams can be used for irrigation and village water&#13;
supplies.&#13;
4.    Parts of the loess plateau in the Yellow River Basin have some of the highest rates of&#13;
sediment runoff in the world. Sediment runoff from an area is expressed as tons/km2/year (the&#13;
sediment modulus) and is averaged over a number of years because there is a wide variation in soil&#13;
erosion from year to year. The parts of the loess plateau with the highest sediment runoff have a&#13;
modulus of about 20,000. This is, however, an average of runoff from a wide variety of terrain and&#13;
land use. Researchers have found that typically about 70 percent of the soil loss is from the sides of&#13;
the gullies and about 30 percent from the surrounding land.&#13;
5.    Sediment control dams serve a number of purposes. First, they intercept sediment that&#13;
would otherwise be deposited in downstrean river channels. This deposition of sediment raises&#13;
bed levels and hence flood levels, and in turn requires periodic, and costly, raising of flood&#13;
embankments. Second, the reduction in high sediment flows leads to more efficient irrigation;&#13;
canals do not have to be closed as frequently due to high sediment flows, and there is less sediment&#13;
to be cleared from the irrigation channels. Third, the dams largely eliminate high flows in the&#13;
gullies, and this reduces the undercutting and collapse of the gully sides that contributes much of&#13;
the sediment runoff. Fourth, the sediment collected by the dams creates high-quality farmland.&#13;
6.    The dams are homogenous, earth fill embankmnents. The areas submerged by the dams&#13;
consist of eroded slopes and gully beds and are uninhabited. In recent years a mode of construction&#13;
using hydraulic fill has been perfected. The loess material on the sides of the gully is sluiced with&#13;
high pressure hoses into the dam body. The fill is contained between upstream and downstrem&#13;
shells formed by bulldozers. The loess forming the foundation for the dam is cleared of loose&#13;
material in the gully bed and the abutments before the fill is placed.&#13;
7.    The procedures for design review and supervision will be the same as those adopted for the&#13;
dams financed under the IDA- financed Loess Plateau Project. These procedures are fully&#13;
consistent with Bank standards. Design and construction standards for sediment control dams have&#13;
been improved considerably following some dam failures in 1977 when exceptionally intense&#13;
storms hit the loess plateau. The design standards call for the dams to be designed for a 30-year&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-91-                       ANNEX5&#13;
flood and checked for a 200-year flood. A 30-year flood is in fact the volume resulting from a&#13;
30-year storm. This volume has to be contained without exceeding a reservoir level 3 m below the&#13;
dam crest. The flood from a 200-year storm has to be contained with a reservoir level 0.5 m below&#13;
the crest. A 30-year, 24-hour storm in the loess plateau depends on location and ranges between&#13;
100 and 160 mm and a 200-year storm ranges between 140 to 210 nmu. This design approach is&#13;
conservative since the significant flood-reducing effect of dams that have been built, or may be&#13;
built, upstream is ignored in the design of the key dams. The active storage capacity for the dams is&#13;
the gross capacity less the volurne of sediment estimated to be stored in 15 years. Thus, in the&#13;
years when the sediment is building up in the reservoir, the actual capacity of the reservoir exceeds&#13;
the required design capacity, and it is during this period that the upstream catchment is likely to be&#13;
further controlled by additional sediment control dams.&#13;
8.    The geometry of the gullies is such that key dams and warping dams have to be relatively&#13;
high to serve their purpose; the range is usually 5-15 m but some are as high as 30 m. For most&#13;
reservoirs, the bulk of the active storage volume is in the top 5 m and, when sedimentation begins&#13;
to infiringe on the flood storage capacity, the option is available at most sites to increase the height&#13;
of the dam. This can be done at a fraction of the initial cost since it involves a low embankment&#13;
placed on the sediment behind the dam. At many sites, raising could be carried out a number of&#13;
times since a dam typically occupies a small part of the total heigJt of a gully. Each damn has an&#13;
outlet conduit with an intake structure designed to accommodate future raising of the dam.&#13;
9.    The topography of the watersheds allows considerable flexibility in siting the dams. Site&#13;
selection criteria for the dams include a requirement that they should be located at sites remote from&#13;
existing or potential settlements. All the dams proposed for the project satisfy that criterion.&#13;
Therefore, in the unlikely event of failure there would be no danger to life and limited damage to&#13;
property.&#13;
10.   Sediment control dams are designed by the provincial water resource bureaus according to&#13;
standards developed by the Ministry of Water Resources in 1986 ("Technical Standard for Major&#13;
Gully Control Structures," SDI75-86). These standards have been endorsed by the Planning&#13;
Academy of MWR as well as the Ministry of Energy. They specify all aspects of design and&#13;
construction including planning procedures, site selection, dam  body layout, calculation of&#13;
hydrologic design parameters, foundation design, choice of construction materials, construction&#13;
techniques, hydrologic and hydraulic design.&#13;
11.   The procedures require multilevel technical reviews and approval of design and&#13;
construction of sediment control dams. Preliminary designs are carried out by county water and&#13;
soil conservation bureaus. Initial review and approval of structural design and siting will be carried&#13;
out by prefecture water and soil conservation authorities who will, in tum, submit construction&#13;
*   applications to the provincial authorities for final review and approval. The ultimate responsibility&#13;
for ensuring compliance with design procedures and technical specifications will rest with the&#13;
provincial authorities. These procedures, are currently applied to structures over 15 m height, but&#13;
the province has agreed to that they will be applied to all dams over 10 m height.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-92 -                      ANNEXS&#13;
12.   Construction is carried out by construction teams selected and supervised by the county&#13;
water conservancy bureaus. There are numerous such tearns qualified to construct darns using the&#13;
hydraulic fill technique. The advantage of this mode of construction is that it produces a dense and&#13;
uniform fill which is less demanding, in terms of close quality control and inspection, than&#13;
mechanically compacted fill.&#13;
13.   Routine maintenance and inspection of structures will be carried out by townships and&#13;
villages under a contract to the county water conservancy bureaus. These contracts specify the type&#13;
of maintenance to be performed and how often these procedures should be performed. Prefecture&#13;
authorities will also carry out inspections of each key dam during the year. In addition to such&#13;
routine maintenance, the provincial authorities will conduct pre- and post-flood season inspections&#13;
of all key dams and an information system will established by the prefectural water resource bureau&#13;
to document construction and maintenance history for all sediment control dams. A cost estimate&#13;
for the check dams is shown in Table 5.&#13;
Afforestation&#13;
14.   Tree planting is planned for 4,200 ha of steep slopes and wasteland. Chinese pine, larch&#13;
and poplar are the main species suited to the area. Trees will be planted on land where the steep&#13;
slope or poor soils render it unsuitable for crops or orchards. This increases the supply of fuel&#13;
wood, lumber, and improves soil and water conservation. Poplar will be mainly planted on gentle&#13;
slopes without terraces. Pine and larch will be planted on narrow terraces on land with steep slopes&#13;
(20°-300). Participating households will tend I ha of plantings. The area planted will be 1,400 ha&#13;
of each of the three species giving a total plantation area of 4,200 ha. In practice, the three species,&#13;
together with other suitable tree species, will be established as mixed plantations. Cost estimates&#13;
are shown in Table 8.&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
15.   The project would convert 16,400 ha of slope land to 13,400 ha of terraces. The higher&#13;
yields of maize, soybean and potatoes will lead to significant gains in their net production values.&#13;
Crop budgets are shown in Table 2, and the with and without cropping patterns are shown in&#13;
Table 3. The ERR for terracing is 18 percent as derived in Tables 3 and 4.&#13;
16.   The 56 check dams will retain a sediment load of 1.8 million tons annually. The benefit&#13;
from this is based on the sediment retention benefit of I Yuan per ton of sediment derived in&#13;
studies carried out for the appraisal of the IDA-financed Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation&#13;
Project. The 270 ha of land created by the dams is highly fertile and will be used mainly for maize,&#13;
sorghum and sunflower. Economic crop budgets (Table 6) have been estimated for these crops&#13;
showing that the annual incremental net value of crop production will reach Y 787,000 by Year 10&#13;
(Table 5). The economic cash flow analysis presented in Table 7 includes sediment retention and&#13;
crop benefits. The ERR is 14 percent.&#13;
17.   Economic crop budgets for pine, larch and poplar are presented in Tables 9, 10 and 11.&#13;
These show that the long-term benefits from timber and the shorter term benefits from poles and&#13;
firewood generate, even under conservative yield assumptions, sufficient returns to pay back the&#13;

ANNEX 6: RURAL ROADS&#13;
Summary&#13;
1.    The systems in the prefectures are in reasonable condition and well maintained, but there is&#13;
considerable scope to improve existing rural roads to provide all-weather access to some of the&#13;
townships and villages. This component will upgrade existing gravel roads to Class 4 Standard&#13;
(Rural Roads) in the project areas by widening them to 7.5 meters (a 6 m pavement of 20 cm of&#13;
compacted gravel, and 0.75 m shoulders). This standard calls for a minimum radius of 30 m,&#13;
minimum sight distance of 30 m, and maximum grade of 8 percent. The improved roads will fill&#13;
critical gaps in the county road systems and they will (a) lower transport costs of inputs and outputs&#13;
for farmers and small mines, (b) attract buyers for farm produce, and (c) lead to new, or more&#13;
frequent, bus services that will expand opportunities for off-farm employment and access to social&#13;
services and education. The project will upgrade six roads with a total length of 209 km in&#13;
Yuncheng and five roads totalling 118 km in Luliang.&#13;
2.    The main economic benefits of the improved access provided by the roads will arise from:&#13;
(a)   more productive land use due a switch to higher value crops;&#13;
(b)   higher farm-gate prices for crops;&#13;
(c)   lower input costs leading to higher returns to the farmers;&#13;
(d)   lower material costs for existing mining operations, and lower transportation costs&#13;
for the output of the mines.&#13;
3.    More frequent and reliable movement of passenger vehicles will lead to social benefits such&#13;
as:&#13;
(a)   more opportunities for off-farm employment;&#13;
(b)   easier access to health and other social services;&#13;
(c)   better access to schools;&#13;
(d)   a wider variety of farm products in the rural markets.&#13;
4.    The roads will be built by the County Transportation Bureaus using labor-intensive&#13;
methods. For maintenance, sections of road will be assigned to nearby villages and enterprises.&#13;
They will organize work teams to carry out routine maintenance of the road surface, structures and&#13;
drains on a voluntary basis. Improvement and major repairs will be funded by the counties and&#13;
townships and work will be assigned to local construction teams.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-108-                         ANNEX 6&#13;
5.    A notable feature of these roads is that tolls will be charged. This is permissible because the&#13;
roads are externally financed. The first call on these funds will be for maintenance and repair, and&#13;
this will ease the problem often encountered in securing funds for rural road maintenance. The tolls&#13;
proposed are as follows:&#13;
Trucks with 4 ton capacity or more: -      Y 3&#13;
Trucks 2.5-4 tons:                         Y 2&#13;
Vehicles with less than 1-2, 5 ton capacity:  Y 1&#13;
Yuncheng Prefecture&#13;
6.    TongsL  This 38 kan road in Yanqu county connects Tongshan township to Lishan&#13;
township and beyond to Xihonghong at the border with Henan. The impact area has a population&#13;
of 25,000 and 2,470 ha of farmland. There are three iron ore mines and one copper mine on the&#13;
road, and the ore is now moved by trailers and small tractors to the main road. The high cost of&#13;
moving the output and the pit props and other supplies for the mines reduces the profitability of&#13;
these township enterprises. With the new road, farming will become more profitable, the mines&#13;
will expand output, have lower transport costs and employ more labor.&#13;
7.    Moyuan. This 31 km road in Jiang county links two main highways and passes three&#13;
townships. The impact area has a population of 25,000, 3,100 ha of farmland, a coal mine, an iron&#13;
ore mine and a copper mine. The road will tead to more diversity in farming and expansion of the&#13;
mines.&#13;
8.    Laoxia. This 15 km road in Xiahua county will link Laoyaotou village to the county town.&#13;
The impact area has a population of 15,000 and 1,560 ha of farmland. There are five small coal&#13;
mines with a combined production of 150,000 tons most of which is moved by mules and animal&#13;
drawn wagons. Improvement of the road will raise farm production, allow expansion of the mines,&#13;
and lead to higher employment.&#13;
9.    Pinguan. This 28 km road in Pinlu county will connect six townships to the provincial&#13;
road and railroad system, and to a bridge over the Yellow River. The impact area has a population&#13;
of about 230,000. About 10 km of road surface has been improved near the county town by&#13;
voluntary labor and this has had led to increased cultivation of fruits and vegetables. A similar&#13;
effect is expected within the 12,500 ha of farmland served by the road. Lower transport costs for&#13;
supplies and output due to the improved road will lead to more efficient and profitable output from&#13;
the existing township and village #nterprises mining coal, gypsum, iron ore and titanium.&#13;
10.   Xiaqi. This 69 km road in Xia county runs from the outskirts of the county town to Qijiahe&#13;
township and passes five townships. The impact area includes 80 villages, and has a population of&#13;
69,000. The farmland area is 6,770 ha, and there is considerable potential for farmers to switch to&#13;
high value crops; marketing conditions are ideal since the county town is on a provincial highway.&#13;
County officials estimate that, with an improved road, annual output from at six existing mines will&#13;
quickly expand from 85,000 tons to 360,000 tons and create over 1,000 jobs.&#13;
&#13;

11.   Zeguan. This 26 km road in Xinjiang county joins the townships of Zezhang and&#13;
Guanwangmiao and serves 65,000 people in two other townships and 50 villages. Earthwork for&#13;
10 km of the road has been constructed by the voluntary labor. The road is impassable after rain or&#13;
snow. The impact area has 4,340 ha of fannland, devoted to wheat, cotton, maize and apples. The&#13;
road will lead to higher production of fruit and vegetables. There are two iron ore mines, two&#13;
gypsum mines and five limestone quarries along the road. With a better road, the output of the&#13;
mines will increase and transport costs are expected to fall by 25 percent.&#13;
Luliang Prefecture&#13;
12. Qiliang. This 17 kmn road in Lanxian County connects Qijiazhunag and Liangjiazhuang&#13;
townships. In its present condition the road is only passable in dry weather by small tractors. The&#13;
impact area has a population of 11,000 in 31 villages and two townships. The area of farmland is&#13;
3,600 ha. Important cash crops are potatoes, kernel apricots, and seabuckthorn, but poor road&#13;
conditions hamper movement of crops to market and every year some of the harvest is spoiled.&#13;
Side-line activities are community-owned coal and iron ore mines, which will become more&#13;
profitable and will be expanded when the road is improved.&#13;
13.   Shizha. This 18 km road in Fangshan county connects Shizhantou and Zhangjiata&#13;
townships and passes near three other townships. It is passable to small vehicles and animal drawn&#13;
carts. The impact area has a population of 9,500 and familand of 2,600 ha. The main benefit of the&#13;
road will be diversification into higher value crops and expansion of orchards.&#13;
14.   Caiwei. This 38 km road in Xingxian county connects Caijiaya and Weijiatan townships.&#13;
The impact area has a population of 43,600 in five townships and 113 villages, and farmland of&#13;
14,800 ha. The area has potential for expansion of Chinese dates and apples and, when the road is&#13;
completed, a processing plant will be built. An existing coal mine will also be expanded.&#13;
15.   Liuxia. This 25 km road in Linxian county connects Liujiahui and Xiaojiatou townships&#13;
and passes close to three other townships. The impact area has a population of 65,000 and&#13;
farmland of 12,500 ha. It is the main Chinese date production center of Shanxi province. The&#13;
improvement of the road will reduce post-harvest losses caused by damage in transport and closure&#13;
of the road by rain and snow.&#13;
16.   Xuexia. This 20 km road in Liulin county connects Xuecun and Xiabo townships. It will&#13;
serve 45,000 people in five townships and 103 villages. There is 8,120 ha of fannland, of which&#13;
2,200 is devoted to fruit and vegetables. The poor condition of the road leads to considerable waste&#13;
and spoilage. Road improvement will lead to higher production and sales of high-value crops at&#13;
better prices.&#13;

Economic Analysis&#13;
17.   The rural roads are in the areas where agriculture is the main economic activity. Their&#13;
economic justification rests largely on improved productivity on 70,000 hectare of farm land in the&#13;
impact area of the roads. There would also be benefits to small-scale mines operated by township&#13;
and village enterprises, but these have not been quantified due to lack of data.&#13;
18.   Agricultural benefits arise from:&#13;
(a)   A cost saving effect due to a reduction in transport costs (lower vehicle operating&#13;
costs and shorter distances) that lower farm-gate input prices and raise farm-gate&#13;
output prices.&#13;
(b)   An efficiency improvement effect due to more timely availability and lower cost of&#13;
agricultural inputs, and a reduction in post harvest losses.&#13;
(c)   A development effect due to better access to markets that causes a shift in cropping&#13;
patterns towards high-value crops and increased fruit production. The areas served&#13;
by the roads have a comparative advantage for the production of fruits (apples in&#13;
Yuncheng and Chinese dates in Luliang).&#13;
19.   Economic analyses were made for two typical roads, one in Luliang and one in Yuncheng&#13;
(Tables 2 to 7). Economic cro.p budgets and cropping patterns for the "with" and "without" cases&#13;
were derived for the major agricultural crops in areas served by the roads. These crop budgets form&#13;
the basis for calculating the total incremental net value of production according to the effects&#13;
described above (Tables 3 and 6). Annual maintenance for the roads was taken as 15 percent of the&#13;
capital cost. The ERR was 37 percent for Luliang and 22 percent for Yuncheng. A sensitivity&#13;
analysis shows that a 50 percent reduction in benefits lowers the ERR to 18 percent for Luliang and&#13;
12 percent for Yuncheng.&#13;
20.   The road selected for analysis in Yuncheng shows a lower ERR than Luliang because of the&#13;
high cost of a large bridge at the end of the road. This bridge connects to a wider area and the&#13;
neighboring province, but the benefits from this have not been estimated. In general, the roads will&#13;
have other benefits not captured by the analysis. These include mining benefits, off-farm&#13;
employment opportunities, and better access to education, health and extension services.&#13;

ANNEX 7: RURAL WATER SUPPLY&#13;
- Summary&#13;
1.    There is a severe shortage of water in many villages in both prefectures. In Luliang,&#13;
groundwater can be found in shallow aquifers (10-15 m deep) in the beds of gullies, but these can&#13;
only be pumped for a few hours at 5-10 m3/hour. Most villages get their water from pits in the&#13;
ground (cistems) filled with storm runoff and from shallow wells in the beds of gullies. The latter&#13;
are very low-yielding and in the dry season people have to wait for hours for the wells to recharge&#13;
after the first villagers have filled their buckets.&#13;
2.    Water is often sold in the villages by people who have access to a well in their own village.&#13;
The average family in water-short areas spends around YI00-130 in a year-this is 10 percent of the&#13;
average family income. In addition to the cash cost, the water shortage also causes many hours to&#13;
be spent hauling water which could be spent on more productive activities.&#13;
3.    A better water supply will (a) expand possibilities for villagers to own draft aninals for&#13;
farming and transportation, (b) reduce the incidence of water-bome diseases, (c) allow for watering&#13;
of seedlings in orchard establishment and (d) provide water for small township and village&#13;
enterprises that will create jobs and raise incomes for the local population. The rural water supply&#13;
component of the project will provide water supply systems for 516 villages in Yuncheng and 204&#13;
villages in Luliang.&#13;
4.    The projects have been prepared by the Yuncheng and Luliang Water Resource Bureaus&#13;
and they will supervise construction by the county and township bureaus. These bureaus have their&#13;
own well drilling teams operating under the guidance of ground water geologists who have&#13;
considerable experience in well location and testing. Cost estimates are shown in Tables I and 2.&#13;
Yuncheng&#13;
5.    The plan for Yuncheng is for 78 comparatively large systems including 59 deep well&#13;
systems and 19 diversion schemes serving 516 villages, 620,000 people and 120,000 draft animals.&#13;
In Yuncheng, wells to produce a reliable supply of good quality water (40-60 m3/hour) have to be&#13;
between 150 and 300 meters deep. The systems are planned to provide 30 liters per day (Ipd) per&#13;
person and 50 lpd per animal. Some water is used for vegetable and fruit trees, but strict operating&#13;
rules are imposed on each well to prevent over drawing the groundwater resource. Compliance&#13;
with the rules is monitored by the county water resource bureaus. Violators are fined or their&#13;
operating license is suspended. A typical deep well system consists of a well and pump house, an&#13;
operators house, piping to storage tanks in each of the villages served, and distribution pipes to&#13;
several standpipes in each village. Diversion schemes typically take water from springs. A&#13;
collection tank is constructed at the source and protected from pollution. A pump is placed in the&#13;
tank and the rest of the system is similar to the deep well schemes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-121-                          ANNEX 7&#13;
Luliang&#13;
6.    Luliang plans water supply facilities for 204 villages, including 77 well systems, 65&#13;
schemes based on springs, and 1,179 cistems in the remaining 62 villages. The schemes will serve&#13;
64,000 people or about 50 percent of the remaining population of 135,000 in the prefecture without&#13;
access to reliable drinking water. In Luliang, groundwater can be found in shallow aquifers (10-15&#13;
m deep) in the beds of gullies, but these can only be pumped for a few hours at 5-10 m3/hour.&#13;
Except for the much shallower wells, the basic approach is the same as in Yuncheng, but the&#13;
systems are generally smaller because of the lower population density.&#13;
D. Operation and Maintenance&#13;
7.    The PMOs of the two prefectures' water conservancy bureaus will establish a Regional&#13;
Support Unit (RSU) to oversee (a) overall project planning, implementation and management;&#13;
(b) enforcement of Water Laws and regulations; (c) technical assistance and emergency repairs; and&#13;
(d) supervision of routine operations and arbitration of disputes among villages or townships&#13;
regarding water use. The actual construction works will be awarded to local contractors through&#13;
competitive bidding. Routine operation and maintenance of the pumping and diverting systems&#13;
would be contracted to individuals, who would follow the regulations stipulated in the Water Law&#13;
and the guidelines set by the RSUs. These individual managers will also be responsible for&#13;
collecting water charges from villages to finance the 0 &amp; M.&#13;
E. Economic Analysis&#13;
8.    The improved water supply will (a) reduce the amount of time or money required to carry&#13;
or purchase water by villagers; (b) expand possibilities for villagers to own draft animals for&#13;
farming and transportation; (c) reduce the incidence of water-bom diseases; and (d) allow for&#13;
watering of seedlings in orchard establishment. In some locations, water will be provided for small&#13;
township and village enterprises&#13;
9.    The economic justification of the rural water supply component is based on the peoples'&#13;
willingness to pay. In villages in Yuncheng, without access to drinking water, and where the water&#13;
is transported in tanks towed by farm tractors, people pay up to YIO-13 per cubic meter. A typical&#13;
family spends about Y 100 to Y 130 Y per family for drinking water during the dry season when&#13;
their rain water tanks dry up. This is a reasonable measure of the upper limit of peoples'&#13;
willingness to pay. In villages with existing water supply systems the people pay between Y 1.5&#13;
and Y 2.5 per cubic meter and spend about Y30 to Y40 Yuan per family in a year. For the benefit&#13;
calculation the lower value of Y 1.5 Yuan per cubic meter is used as an average figure for the&#13;
willingness to pay. This is a conservative estimate, since the observed value of Y 1.5 Yuan is a&#13;
marginal value and many people would be willing to pay higher prices particularly for smaller&#13;
amounts of water as the situation in Yuncheng shows. On this basis, the rural water supply&#13;
component was found to generate a weighted average ERR of 22 percent (Table 3).&#13;
10.   An alternative measurement of the benefits has been tested, based on the fact that people&#13;
spend a substantial share of their time in collecting and hauling water. At many of the open wells&#13;
there is a long waiting time for the well to recharge after each villager takes his of her share. It is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 122 -                       ANNEX 7&#13;
assuned that 40 percent of the population are economically active and spend about 10 pement of&#13;
thir time hauling water. The distance to the water source in many location in Yuncbhng is&#13;
between 3 and 5 kilometers, and particularly in Lulian&amp; there is in addition often a difference in&#13;
altitude of 100 to 200 meters between the village and the wate source. If this time is&#13;
conservatively valued at Y 2.5 per day, the time saved amounts to about Y 25 million annuallyand&#13;
the ERR is 23 percent This is close to the ERR based on willingness to pay (Table 3).&#13;

ANNEX 8: LIVESTOCK&#13;
Summary&#13;
1.    The aim of the livestock component would be to raise the incomes of the poorer farmers&#13;
through the introduction of large animals to their farming operation. The component also includes&#13;
improvements in veterinary services, artificial insemination, and research. The main elements of&#13;
the component will be:&#13;
(a)   the introduction of livestock to poor and marginal farmers who have access to&#13;
adequate crop residues and/or large areas of unimproved natural pasture;&#13;
(b)   the improvement of veterinary and artificial insemination services;&#13;
(c)   the introduction of better techniques for silage making and the upgrading of&#13;
artificial and natural pastures amongst existing livestock owners; and&#13;
(d)   research in topics relevant to small livestock farmers, and training for project&#13;
officials and farmers.&#13;
2.    Farmers would be provided with two breeding cows. The farmers themselves would&#13;
construct the necessary livestock shelter, water trough and silage pit. The cows would be paid for&#13;
over 6-12 years and farmers would be required to take out an insurance policy against the death of&#13;
their foundation animals. Simple low-cost fodder conservation techniques such as ammoniated&#13;
straw silage would be promoted and farmers would be encouraged to keep their operational cash&#13;
commitments to a minimum. The current target is for 14,000 farmers to receive a livestock loan&#13;
under the project.&#13;
3.    Facilities and equipment would be improved at 222 existing veternary service stations, the&#13;
Shanxi Frozen Semen Center in Taiyuan, the Jinan Yellow Cattle Breeding Center in Yuncheng&#13;
and the frozen semen and liquid nitrogen production center in Lishi.&#13;
4.    To promote better quality silage making, livestock owners would be provided with&#13;
grass/straw choppers. Crop residues from a number of farmers could be handled by a single&#13;
chopping machine located in villages where new livestock farmers are to be established. An&#13;
additional 500 loans would be offered to existing livestock owners for the establishment of artificial&#13;
pastures and improvement of natural pasture and wasteland. Where individual enclosure of pasture&#13;
is either impractical or not accepted, loans should be offered to groups of livestock owners for the&#13;
improvement of common grazing areas. Cost estimates are shown in Table 1.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-132-                           ANNEX 8&#13;
Cattle Production&#13;
5.    In recent years there has been a movement away from large collectively-owned herds of&#13;
cattle in which a high proportion were male animals kept for draught purposes, to small&#13;
individually-owned herds where breeding cows predominate. Where grazing is available, these&#13;
small herds are often managed as a group under the care of a professional herdsman. In areas of&#13;
intensive arable farming cattle are kept close to the homestead in shelters where stall feeding is&#13;
carried out.&#13;
6.    With the diversity in farming practices found in the project area, there are an equally varied&#13;
set of cattle management practices. However, there appear to be common management themes&#13;
developing amongst small cattle owners which deserve recognition. Farmers are anxious to own&#13;
breeding cows and regard them as a source of draught power as well as producing cash and other&#13;
benefits through calves and manure production. Also, cattle are seen as a cashable security in times&#13;
of hardship or sudden crisis. It is widely reported that the majority of farmers sell calves in their&#13;
first year of age primarily to meet cash demands but also to reduce the high feed costs of winter and&#13;
early spring. Few small farmers fatten cattle for beef.&#13;
7.    There is some evidence of specialised beef fattening enterprises emerging to meet the strong&#13;
nationwide demand for beef. Such operations buy animals either directly from the small farmer in&#13;
the village or from an official cattle saleyards which are found throughout the project area. These&#13;
enterprises are able to offer economies of scale, cultivate better market access, and improved&#13;
fattening techniques and management. It is a logical development for an expanding industry and&#13;
one that will provide benefits for the small farmer engaged in cow-calf breeding.&#13;
8.    Livestock prices have risen rapidly in the last two years, and in 1994 rose on average over&#13;
200 percent. Average sale prices for in-calf cows and heifers have in the past 12 months risen from&#13;
Yl,300 to Y3,500 and there has been commensurate increases in value of yearling animals. The&#13;
principal reason for this spurt in livestock values seems to be increased demand for beef and other&#13;
meats brought about by the growth of disposable incomes throughout China. Deregulation&#13;
throughout the economy is allowing farmners to respond to demand by increasing livestock numbers&#13;
but the immediate supply of breeding stock is limited. It will be difficult for the project to procure&#13;
significant numbers of breeding cows in Shanxi Province without seriously distorting prices.&#13;
Therefore, cattle will have to be purchased from other provinces where at present surplus animals&#13;
are available.&#13;
9.    Management techniques and ability are varied. In general, the cattle in the highlands are&#13;
kept less intensively than those in the low lands. Low calving indices are apparently acceptable in&#13;
both areas and it is a common practice not to serve an animal which is lactating. Calving indices&#13;
reported range from 0.5 to 1; however, indices of 0.75 to 0.85 are not ambitious and should be&#13;
readily attained.&#13;
10.   Animal health is remarkably good. Brucellosis and endo parasites are reported to be&#13;
problems but the incidence of abortion is reported as low and routine treatmnent for fluke and worms&#13;
is said to be generally practiced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-133 -                          ANNEX8&#13;
11.   The policy of the Animal Husbandry Bureau (AHB) is to encourage the use of Artificial&#13;
Insemination (AI) and promote the crossbreeding of the local Yellow Jinan cattle with exotics such&#13;
as Simmental for their perceived faster growth rate and better carcass conformation. AHB&#13;
estimates that about 30 percent of the cows in the project area are bred to Al with a success rate of&#13;
about 1.8 inseminations per conception. However, no work seems to have been carried out to&#13;
compare the feed conversion efficiency or biomass production of the local breeds with the exotics&#13;
under normal village conditions, despite the evidence that the meat from the these local breeds is&#13;
highly sought after and is even exported to Hong Kong. The project will initiate this research and&#13;
provide funding to maintain the local breed.&#13;
Sheep and Goat Production&#13;
12.   Most sheep and goat flocks are grazed extensively in the growing season and grazed in the&#13;
winter and spring on crop residues and natural pasture with some supplementation with conserved&#13;
fodder. The majority of flocks number between 20 and 50, the latter being the number which&#13;
require a full time herder. The method of grazing sheep and goats on steep land accelerates erosion&#13;
and intensive grazing in winter and spring, if not carefully controlled, increases tree damage&#13;
through bark stripping. The project will assist in the development of improved herd managing&#13;
practices. The main product is wool or fibre and the demand for meat is firm although not as high&#13;
as that for beef and pork. skins are in demand for leather, and all by-products have a local market,&#13;
and are also exported. Present management practices of sheep and goats are create erosion&#13;
problems and endanger the long-term sustainable use of the natural grazing resources.&#13;
Livestock Services&#13;
13.   Although the condition of roads in the upland and mountain villages of the project area are&#13;
often poor, veterinary and artificial insemination services are found in all counties and townships&#13;
with some sub-stations at village level. Veterinary staff at townships and below are funded by the&#13;
charges levied for treatments and vaccinations and the mark-up on the sale price of medicines and&#13;
inseminations. These veterinary staff are also responsible for demonstration and extension work&#13;
relating to animal husbandry, animal health, pasture improvement and fodder conservation.&#13;
Institutions&#13;
14.   The relevant administrative department at provincial level is The Shanxi Livestock and&#13;
Veterinary Departrnent (LVD) is resposible for livestock throughout the province. It controls the&#13;
Provincial Animal Husbandry Bureau (AHB) which in turn serves and supervises the county&#13;
AHBs. All LVD and AHB staff are salaried. The AHBs train and supervises the township&#13;
Veterinary Service Station staff, who are responsible for extension and some farmer training at the&#13;
village level. Staff at this level draw their wages from the fees they charge, and from the mark-up&#13;
on goods sold to farmers. In addition, it is cormrmon for supplementary non-veterinary activities to&#13;
be carried out to help fund veterinary activities and staff.&#13;
15.   Further support for the sector is provided by the Shanxi Livestock and Veterinary Institute,&#13;
the Shanxi Agricultural Research Institute and the Shanxi Agricultural University. All these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-134-                          ANNEX 8&#13;
institutions are active in animal husbandry, grassland and pasture improvement research, and in the&#13;
selection and evaluation of different pasture plant accessions. The Pastwe and Grassland Station,&#13;
the Fodder and Feed Station, the Livestock and Fowl Breeding Station and the Station for the&#13;
Prevention and Treatment of Diseases of Livestock come under the provincial LVD.&#13;
16.   The Shanxi Frozen Semen Center at Taiyuan is the main source of frozen semen in the&#13;
province for artificial insemination (Al) of cattle. The Jinan Yellow Cattle Improvement Center in&#13;
Yuncheng and the Lishi Frozen Semen Center act as semen storage depots and distribution centers&#13;
for the Veteinary Service Stations whose staff carry out the inseminations.&#13;
17.   In-service training of prefectural and county staff is the responsibility of the provincial&#13;
AHB. Training of township technicians and farmers is carried out by prefectural staff and county&#13;
staff. Townships staff serve as the extension contact with farmers groups and individuals. In 1994&#13;
all prefecture and county level staff received a series of training programs on the use and&#13;
improvement of natural pastures, the ammonia treatment of crop residues, silage making and&#13;
methods of mixing feed for ruminants. These technical staff are now training township staff and&#13;
farmers. Farmers appear to have a high degree of confidence in the skills of the lower level&#13;
technical staff.&#13;
Credit and Insurance&#13;
18.   Fonnal agricultural credit is the responsibility of the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC).&#13;
Recently ABC has undergone a restructuring where its loan commitments under govemment&#13;
programs have been spun off to a new loan entity, the Agricultural Development Bank of China.&#13;
This move is designed to allow ABC to follow a more market-oriented and commercial approach to&#13;
agricultural lending. ABC's existing livestock sector loan portfolio is small and loan repayments&#13;
terms are limited to 1-2 years. The Prefectural Insurance Company offers cover against death of&#13;
animals with insurance premiums ranging from 3-5 percent per annum of the animal value. These&#13;
insurance rates are much higher than those which might be expected considering the low recorded&#13;
death losses in the project area. However, in the past there appears to have been farmer abuses of&#13;
the insurance system and this is now reflected in higher rates.&#13;
Detailed Features&#13;
19.   Introduction of Cattle. About 10,900 farmers in Yuncheng and 2,900 farmers in Luliang&#13;
will receive two breeding cows/heifers.&#13;
(a)   Priority would be given to farmers from villages that do not have large numbers of&#13;
existing livestock and where agricultural income levels are below average.&#13;
(b)   In the lowlands, farmers should have a minimum of lOmu of arable land under grain&#13;
crops from which residues can be retained for animal fodder. In addition, these&#13;
farmers should be located in areas where there are surplus crop residues which can&#13;
be acquired in exchange for manure, labor or cash.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-135 -                          ANNEX 8&#13;
(c)   In the mountains, farmers should also have about 10 mu of arable land under grain&#13;
crops and access to natural pasture under a contract of not less than 30 years. Care&#13;
should be taken that the natural pasture areas have adequate capacity to receive&#13;
additional animals.&#13;
(d)   Farmers would be expected, from their own resources, to provide an adequate&#13;
animal shelter, a water trough and a silage pit or pits .&#13;
20.   The cost of breeding cattle has risen sharply over the last 18 months, and quality&#13;
cows/heifers are expected to cost Y 4,000 per head at the time of purchase. Full procurement of a&#13;
sufficient number of quality animals for the project may prove difficult in a single year and&#13;
implementation will be phased over two or more years. However, as regards individual farmers,&#13;
they will receive a complete animal package in one transaction.&#13;
21.   Veterinary Service Stations. A total of 324 township veterinary service stations (VSS)&#13;
service the project area in both prefectures and about 222 stations have been identified for&#13;
improvement. They are staffed by between two and four veterinary technicians. At present the&#13;
VSS's have no motorized transport and their ability to service the veterinary and artificial&#13;
insemination needs of remote areas is limited. The project would provide a motorcycle for the&#13;
identified VSSs and motorcycles would be assigned and sold to specific staff to avoid overuse or&#13;
misuse. Staff receiving a motorcycle loan will be paid an allowance for duty use which would fully&#13;
cover the operation and maintenance of the machine. Each VSS will have a refrigerator, liquid&#13;
nitrogen flasks, a microscope, a sterilizer and a basic set of surgical instruments. The project will&#13;
finance the construction of 90 treatment rooms in those VSS's without this facility. To assist in the&#13;
tansport and distrbution of semen, liquid nitrogen, demonstration materials and vaccines, eight&#13;
utility vehicles will be provided for those counties (five in Yuncheng and three in Luliang) having&#13;
the highest work load.&#13;
22.   Artificial Insemination Centers. The Shanxi Frozen Semen Center at Taiyuan will be&#13;
supported by providing computer equipment for contemporary comparison of bull performance.&#13;
This equipment will assist the Center in the publication of a herdbook with comparative&#13;
performance figures. The project will also provide a second line for the production of frozen semen&#13;
straws and plugs and the purchase of four Jinan Yellow bulls for the maintenance of good quality&#13;
germ plasm of local breeds.&#13;
23.   Jinan Yellow Cattle Breeding Center. Upgrading the Jinan Yellow Cattle Breeding&#13;
Center in Yuncheng requires no major structural work but the project will provide funds for the&#13;
renovation of the well, pump, powerline, water tower. Similarly, funds will be provided for the&#13;
repair of the two existing liquid nitrogen generators. At Lishi, the Animal Husbandry Bureau&#13;
intend to relocate the frozen semen center into buildings away from the town's center. The project&#13;
will provide funds for alterations to these buildings and for the purchase of a new 20 liter per hour&#13;
liquid nitrogen generator. To assist with the procurement of semen from Taiyuan and its&#13;
distribution together with vaccines and demonstration materials throughout the project area, the&#13;
project will provide for eight utility vehicles (Yuncheng five, Luliang three).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-136-                           ANNEX 8&#13;
24.   Silage Makdng and Pasture Improvement. To support the development of higher quality&#13;
ammonia treated straw and grass silage, the project will provide loan finds for existing livestock&#13;
farmers to purchase electrically operated grass/straw choppers. Two hundred chopping machines&#13;
will be funded and extension staff will focus their silage demonstration on farmers using these&#13;
machines. Five hundred pasture improvement loans will also be provided for existing livestock&#13;
owners to establish artificial alfalfa/chinese vetch pastures and improve natural pastures through the&#13;
introduction of better grass and legume species and the application of fertilizer. Similarly,&#13;
extension staff will work with the farmers taking up pastures loans to promote the wider use of&#13;
quality pasture amongst livestock owners.&#13;
25.   The introduction of cattle to farmers in the project area will generate income from a surplus&#13;
of feed resources. In the plain areas of Yuncheng there are large amounts of wheat straw and maize&#13;
stover as byproducts from the cropping activities and in the hilly areas in both prefectures there are&#13;
unused resources of natural pasture which can best be exploited by large ruminants.&#13;
Financial and Economic Analysis&#13;
26.   A farm model has been prepared to estimate the likely financial results of introducing&#13;
livestock to a typical farm (Table 2). The risk to the farmer is limited by keeping the investments to&#13;
a minimum and he will borrow only for the purchase of two breeding cattle or heifers. The&#13;
construction of shelter, silage pits, water tanks and some fencing will be low cost and done with his&#13;
own labor. On this basis the farmer will be able to pay back the initial loan for the breeding&#13;
animals from the sale of off-spring within six years and he will have, even during this repayment&#13;
period, an annual cash surplus of about Y 490. After repayment, the annual net farm income from&#13;
this livestock operation will be about Y 1,800, which will be a return to labor of Y37 per day.&#13;
27.   The ERR is 20 percent and includes all investment in support services such as artificial&#13;
insemination centers and veterinary services (Table 3). These services will not be limited to the&#13;
project farmers and will create wider benefits that are not included in the economic analysis. A&#13;
sensitivity analysis shows that a drop in the fertility rate from 70 to 60 percent, which could result&#13;
from poor insemination practices and/or poor health standards and calf death, would drop the ERR&#13;
from 20 percent to 14 percent.&#13;

Summary&#13;
1.    The project plan for fruit and nut trees in Yuncheng and Luliang, summarized below, builds&#13;
on considerable experience of suitable orchard crops in the project areas. Except in Yuncheng,&#13;
where the Chinese dates and prickly ash will be interplanted in the wheat fields, the orchards will&#13;
be established on slope lands where the slope is too steep for field crops, or on reclaimed waste&#13;
land. In most cases field crops such as millet and soybean will be interplanted in the early years of&#13;
the orchards. The project will also include improvement of seedling nurseries. This component&#13;
will raise incomes for more than 250,000 households in the project areas, and will also contribute to&#13;
erosion control. Cost estimates are shown in Table 1.&#13;

2.    The red Chinese date (jujube) has been cultivated in Shanxi province for thousands of years.&#13;
During the centuries natural evolution and artificial selection made by the local population have&#13;
resulted in many outstanding varieties. The Chinese date can survive and give a good yields in a&#13;
climate with a short vegetative season (frost-free period being only 150-170 days), dry springs, dry&#13;
and cold winters (-23°C), sparse rainfall (only 400-500 mm/year) and absence of irrigation.&#13;
Ability to withstand these extreme climatic conditions makes the Chinese date a good choice for the&#13;
loess hills of Luliang. It is also highly efficient in using the high sumrnmer sunlight and the little&#13;
water available. Consequently it is a good crop for exploiting the 266,000 ha of slope land and&#13;
118,000 ha of wasteland in the project area. So far, around 42,000 ha of Chinese dates have been&#13;
planted in the project area, with a production of about 30,000 tons (many trees being still&#13;
immature). The range of varieties adopted has been reduced to several high-perfomiimg cultivars,&#13;
selected for their adaptability to the dry soils and climatic conditions of the Luliang mountains.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-141-                           ANNEX 9&#13;
3.    The Chinese date can be eaten fresh or dried and converted into a wide range of products,&#13;
including candied forms, sweets, jellies and juices. In its dried form the fruit can be kept up fo one&#13;
year. The fruit has a high level of Vitamin C content; around 400 mg/I 1Og freshweight, which is&#13;
fourtimes more than kiwi fruit as well as other vitamins A, B and P, and it has an important place in&#13;
Chinesese traditional medicine.&#13;
4.    These new orchards will occupy the hilly loess region,with slopes of 15-20 degrees on the&#13;
west side of the Luliang prefecture. This is land that is considered "low -input and low- output"&#13;
famiing land, mostly used for growing soybean or millet. Within the project, four counties will be&#13;
involved in the new plantations: Xingxian (2,100 ha), Linxian (5,000 ha), Liulin (4,100 ha), and&#13;
Shilou (3,800 ha).&#13;
5.    Land preparation will consist of constructing Im wide terraces with 2 m sloping risers. A&#13;
basin will be formed around each plant to conserve moisture. The orchards will have an average&#13;
density of 750 plants/ha (4mx3.3m). Planting will be mostly in spring, with some in autumn. After&#13;
planting, soybean intercropping will also be possible for the first seven years. Each household will&#13;
manage its own plot of about 0.4 ha (6 mu). At present typical farms have an average of 10 mu&#13;
cultivated as follows: 4-5 mu soybean, 2-3 mu of millet, 2-3 mu of maize.&#13;
6.    The new Chinese date plantings will require around 13,500,000 seedlings in six years, or an&#13;
average of 2.25 million plants annually. The existing nurseries are not able to supply immediately&#13;
such a large amount of'plants, but the project will stimulate the output from farmer-owned and&#13;
operated nurseries. Chinese dates plants produce suckers naturally from the roots. These suckers&#13;
can be collected and transplanted in the nurseries at high density planting (5,000 suckers/mu =&#13;
75,000 suckers/ha) for one or two years, with an output of high quality plants estimated at 4,000&#13;
plants/mu (= 60,000 plants/ha). In some cases, grafting on wild Chinese date seedling can also be&#13;
adopted. The large number of existing trees in the project area assures the availability of suckers&#13;
for the nurseries. To speed up the project implementation with good plant material, the project&#13;
includes finance for about 250 household Chinese date nurseries with an average nursery area of&#13;
0.1 ha.&#13;
7.    Incremental production after 16 years will be around 1 12,500tons. Added to the output of&#13;
the existing area of Chinese dates planted in the project area of 42,000 ha (315,000 tons), future&#13;
production will be around 428,000 tons. The main part of this output will be sold on the domestic&#13;
market, inside Shanxi but also in the southem Chinese provinces where the fruit is popular. The&#13;
Chinese date fruits can be easily stored without any cold storage, thus sales to domestic and foreign&#13;
markets can be carried out all the year around. The "Mu Zao" variety has a good reputation and is&#13;
recognized by domestic and foreign buyers for its high quality in relation to its relatively low price.&#13;
Kernel Apricot (Prunus armeniaca)&#13;
8.    The kemel apricot is suitable for planting at high altitude, from El. 800 m to El. 1,200 m.&#13;
The varieties are selected for their cold and drought resistance, high yield and almond-kemel&#13;
quality. The plan is to plant 2,800 ha of new kemel apricot orchards in the cold, rocky mountain&#13;
areas of five counties, in shallow soils of the millet fields. These local selected apricot varieties&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-142 -                          ANNEX 9&#13;
appear particularly adapted to the climatic conditions, and few alternative fruit trees are suitable for&#13;
these cold areas. Luliang has a long tradition of growing kernel apricots.&#13;
9.    Each householder will convert an average of 0.4 ha (6 mu) of his land to apricot orchards,&#13;
so that about 7,000 households will directly benefit from the project with a total of 28,000 family&#13;
members. The existing county nurseries can supply around 319,000 plants, and the households&#13;
nurseries around 801,000 kernel apricot plants, which will be more than sufficient for the plantings&#13;
in the first year (350,000 plants). The use of this kernel apricot is widespread and popular in China,&#13;
and most of the incremental production will be sold at the domestic market. However, exports will&#13;
also be promoted since the main constraint on exports is lack of product, and in the past exports&#13;
have been made to Japan and to Europe.&#13;
Walnut (Juglans regia)&#13;
10.   New walnut orchards will be planted on 2,800 ha in the high, cool region of the middle&#13;
section of the Luliang mountain, in five counties. The plantations will occupy existing millet fields&#13;
on sloping land. There is a long history and tradition in the project area for walnut cultivation.&#13;
Walnuts are easy to store and transport, the oil and fruit are nutritious, and the wood has many uses&#13;
for ornamentals and furniture.&#13;
11.   The new plantations will have a density of 400 plants/ha(5mx5m)and will be intercropped&#13;
with with millet during the first six years. Before planting, the slope land (15-20 degrees) will be&#13;
terraced with lm wide benches and 4m wide sloping risers.&#13;
12.   For the project implementation the existing state nurseries (at county level) within the&#13;
project area can produce 230,000 walnut plants annually and the household nurseries produce&#13;
550,000 plants, so there willbe an ample supply of seedlings. The main constraint wi be the need&#13;
for good quality plant material in terms of genetic correspondence with the chosen variety grafted&#13;
on a good rootstock, two years old, and capable of good survival after planting in the field. An&#13;
average of 0.4 ha (= 6 mu) will be planted by each household, for a total of 7,000 families or 28,000&#13;
people.&#13;
Apple&#13;
13.   About 700 ha of new apple orchards will be spread over seven counties. There are a&#13;
number of apple nurseries in the project area ensuring an adequate supply of good planting&#13;
material. Existing famiing land occupied by soybean will be planted with low density orchards&#13;
(4rnx4m = 625 plants/ha), using the common well-known high-yielding varieties; the local red&#13;
"Liulinhong" and the more famous "Fuji". The land chosen for apples has 10-15 degrees of slope&#13;
and wide terraces, of about 4m, will be prepared for planting the apple seedlings. At full orchard&#13;
development the new 700 ha of apples will give a fruit output of around 8,750 tons, very small in&#13;
relation to the existing apple production of Shanxi province, which is about 330,000 tons.&#13;
&#13;

-143 -                          ANNEX 9&#13;
Research, Development and Training&#13;
14.   A prograrn of research and development will be undertaken under the supervision of the&#13;
Agricultural Academy of Sciences, in co-operation with the Yuncheng and Luliang Forestry&#13;
Bureaus. In general, the purpose of the described activities is to establish a good, strong&#13;
relationship with the training and extension services, as well as with other institutions in Shanxi and&#13;
in other provinces with similar aims, interests and programmes.&#13;
15.   Tissue Culture Laboratory.  Because of the potential use of the micropropagation&#13;
technique in a medium term program and mainly with the aim of propagating new selected jujube&#13;
clones recently found in the Prefecture, a Tissue Culture Laboratory will be established at the&#13;
Forestry Research Station of Lishi in Luliang. It will include a new building, all necessary&#13;
instruments, a greenhouse and a shade house for transplanting the plantlets to "in vivo" conditions.&#13;
The size of the laboratory will permit an initial production of around 50,000 plantlets/year.&#13;
16.   Cutting Nursery. Besides the tissue culture laboratory, a cutting nursery and a plot for&#13;
mother plants for suckers and scions will also be set up at the Forestry Research Station for research&#13;
in vegetative clonal propagation. In recent years, various experiments have shown the possibility&#13;
of obtaining jujube plants by means of cuttings and rooted under fog or mist irrigation.&#13;
17.   Mother Plant Nursery. A plot will be set up at Lishi where selected mother plants can be&#13;
collected and used every year to obtain suckers or scions for grafting. The proposal includes 60m2&#13;
of cold storage for the scions, 4 refrigerators and a intensive orchard plantation of 14,000 selected&#13;
mother plants. This will assure good plant material for project implementation as well as for any&#13;
other nursery activity for the near future in the field of jujube and walnut vegetative propagation. A&#13;
number of specific research and development projects will be undertaken.&#13;
18.   Increasing yield in young Chinese date orchards. In three counties (Xingxian, Liulin&#13;
and Shilou) plots of 30 mu (2 ha) of existing orchards will be used for different trials of intensive&#13;
soil and plant management for 3 years. Staff will also visit Cangzhou city (Hebei), Jishan (Shanxi),&#13;
Jaocheng (Shanxi). Consultancy will be provided by the Provincial Pomology Institute and&#13;
Provincial Forestry Institute.&#13;
19.   Rejuvenating existing old Chinese date orchards. In three counties (Linxian, Liulin and&#13;
Xingxian) plots of 20 mu (1.3 ha) will be treated to obtain higher yield by means of pruning and&#13;
soil management during three years. This work will be carried out by Luliang Prefecture Forestry&#13;
Bureau, in co-operation with Agronomic Department of Shanxi Agriculture University. Visits are&#13;
planned to Jiaocheng, Jishan and Taigu. The main consultants will be the Provincial Pomology&#13;
Institute and Provincial Forestry Institute.&#13;
20.   Increasing yield in walnut orchards. Two plots of 2 ha each will be planted in Linxian&#13;
and Liulin Counties with different varieties, different plant material and different management to&#13;
obtain early fruit bearing and higher yield in a typical loess area with drought problems. The&#13;
research will be carried out by the Shanxi Forestry Research Institute and Shanxi Food Research&#13;

21.   Control peach moth in Chinese date. In Kehu town (Linxian County) an experimental&#13;
plot will be established, in which pheromone traps will be used as well as chemicals over a three&#13;
year period. Visits and consultancies will be the responsibility of the Plant Protection Department&#13;
of Shanxi Pomology Institute.&#13;
22.   Chinese date post-harvest technology. In co-operation with the Shanxi Farm Product&#13;
Storage and Freshness Conservation Institute, trials will be carried out (i) to improve the storage&#13;
technology of fresh fruits that are the most valuable in the market and have a highnutritional&#13;
content; and (ii) to improve techniques for drying, grading and storing dried fruits. These will be&#13;
done in collaboration with the Shanxi Pomology Institute and Hebei Agricultural University&#13;
(Baoding).&#13;
23.   Increasing yield in kernel apricot orchards. Two plots of 5 ha, in Lishi County and&#13;
Xingxian County will be established to research soil and water management methods to raise yield.&#13;
Shanxi Forestry Research Institute, Shanxi Pomological Research Institute and Luliang Prefectural&#13;
Forestry Bureau will be involved in the trials.&#13;
24.   Training and Extension. A network of Technical Extension Stations, Pest Management&#13;
Stations, Forestry Stations and Forestry Bureaux operates at various levels. About 8,700 farmers&#13;
will attend one-day training courses, twice a year. Prefecture, county, and township technicians will&#13;
be trained for five days twice a year.&#13;
Yuncheng Prefecture&#13;
Chinese Dates&#13;
25.   Chinese dates are indigenous to Yuncheng prefecture and the presence of many old trees,&#13;
sometimes over 400 years old, and many jujube orchards, demonstrates the excellent adaptability of&#13;
this crop to the local environmental conditions. Chinese date are interplanted with grain in areas&#13;
round the Fen river and along the Yellow river. Locally selected varieties of the Chinese date show&#13;
an extraordinary adaptability to the local soil and climate conditions,with their late shooting&#13;
qualities, high cold hardiness, and drought resistance.&#13;
26.   In Yuncheng, Chinese date are mostly planted in wheat fields, both in the plains and the&#13;
hilly terraces. The plants are obtained mainly by suckering, or occasionally by grafting on "shan&#13;
zao" (wild jujube = Zizyphus spinosus Bge ).&#13;
27.   The plan is to plant Chinese dates at wide spacing in about the 23,300 ha of existing wheat&#13;
fields. Average tree density per ha will be only about 180 (15 m rows and 3.7 m spacing) At a&#13;
conventional orchard spacing density of around 750 plants per ha, this will be equivalent to around&#13;
5,600 ha. Varieties will be matched to planting site. A features of the Chinese date, is that in&#13;
spring time it is late in shooting and fonning leaves, in autumn the leaves drop early, in such a way&#13;
that the light availability for field crops standing under the tree canopy is quite high for long&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-145 -                          ANNEX 9&#13;
periods. Chinese date orchards in wheat fields have few technical risks; the main constraints is the&#13;
availability of good plant material.&#13;
28.   For the 23,270 ha of new plantings, there is a need for 8,500,000 plants, plus 1,700,000 for&#13;
20 percent replanting or a total amount of 10,200,000 plants. To provide this large number of&#13;
plants, a great effort will be required by both the state nurseries and those of farm households. The&#13;
only data available gives the area actually taken up by plants in the county nurseries, as follows:&#13;
29.   The nursery land for jujube trees is 10.2 ha. Considering an average of good quality plants&#13;
of 60,000 plants/ha, 612,000 plants are presently available from state nurseries. Survey data on&#13;
household nurseries indicates that their annual capacity will be around 1,000,000 plants. The area&#13;
of planting of 4,700 ha in each of the first two years has been set bearing in mind the ability of the&#13;
nurseries to produce adequate numbers of plants of suitable quality. This allows time to develop&#13;
the nurseries to produce good quality plants for the third and following years of the project&#13;
implementation, when 9,400 and 9,170 ha will be planted.&#13;
Prickly Ash (Zanthoxylum Bungeanum Maxim)&#13;
30.   The new 12,500 ha of Chinese prickly ash orchards will be planted in the same areas as&#13;
existing Chinese prickly ash plantations, in the Emei and Mingtiao mountain ridges, at&#13;
El.600-800 m. The fruits main use is as a spice for cooking, but about 5 percent is used for&#13;
medicinal purposes. Most Chinese families know, and frequently use, this spice. The orchards will&#13;
be established on narrow terraces with a density of 750 plants/ha, and a spacing of 4 x 3.3 m.&#13;
Planting material will be one year old seedlings, provided by local nurseries, of a self-pollinating&#13;
variety, named "Da Hongpao" that is seedling propagated. This variety is chosen for its full red&#13;
fruit colour, high yield, good spicy taste, aroma and flavour.&#13;
Walnut (Juglans regia)&#13;
31.   The areas chosen for 8,870 ha of new walnut orchards are in six counties in the Zhong Tiao&#13;
mountain, chain. at about El.700-800 m. All the new areas will be reclaimed from wasteland. The&#13;
orchards will have a density of 278 plants/ha (6m x 6m) planted on terraces. The plants will be two&#13;
year-old seedlings, obtained from seeds of the local varieties. The genetic quality of the plants&#13;
seemed to be one of the main constraints to good walnut orchard development.&#13;
Chestnut (Castanea mollissima)&#13;
32.   New chestnut orchards will be established on 3,330 of reclaimed wasteland in three&#13;
counties in the Zhang Tiao mountains. This an area in Shanxi province where chestnut trees have&#13;
been grown from many years with good results. The rate of planting will have to be kept within the&#13;
capacity of local nurseries to produce good quality plants. Plant densities will be 5m x 5m = 400&#13;
plants/ha.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-146 -                         ANNEX 9&#13;
Research, Development and Training&#13;
33.   Four subjects will be investigated, all conceming Chinese dates.&#13;
(a)   Increasing yield: 10 ha of orchards in Jishan county will be rented and trials&#13;
established on orchard management to find means of improving productivity,&#13;
testing different soil and water management, fertilising and pruning methods. The&#13;
work will be carried by Prefecture Forestry Station and County Forestry Station.&#13;
(b)   Variety improvement:  5.2 ha of orchards will be bought and new orchard&#13;
established for testing varieties.  The work will be carried out under the&#13;
responsibility of the Shanxi Pomology Institute.&#13;
(c)   Pest management: 30 ha of orchards in Jishan, Ruicheng and Yuncheng, will be&#13;
used by the Prefecture Forestry Bureau and County Bureau to develop integrated&#13;
pest management systems.&#13;
(d)   Drying technique improvement and spreading: 39 sites will be selected in the 13&#13;
counties and trials will be conducted by the Forestry Stations at prefecture and&#13;
county level.&#13;
Training and Extension&#13;
34.   A network of Technical Extension Stations, Pest Management Stations, Forestry Stations&#13;
and Forestry Bureaux operates at various levels. Each year 2,500 selected farmers will be trained&#13;
for 3 days. The main aim of the training activity will be to provide the farmers with practical&#13;
information on the technical and financial aspects of fruit trees. For this, the trainers must first also&#13;
undertake courses to give them up to date information on orchard management, and 30-70&#13;
personnel will be trained for 10 days twice a year.&#13;
Economic Analysis&#13;
35.   At full development, the increased annual fruit and nut production will be 225,000 tons of&#13;
Chinese Dates, 7,500 of tons prickly ash, 45,300 tons of walnuts, 25,600 tons of chestnut, 2,800&#13;
tons of apricots, and 8,400 tons of apples. This will create Y 885 million additional annual net&#13;
income, that will mainly accrue to the poor people in the mountainous areas of Luliang and&#13;
Yuncheng. The component will create employment; about 33,000 person-years will be needed for&#13;
the initial establishment of the orchards and 64,000 people will find permanent employment in their&#13;
operation. Secondary income and employment benefits will come from fruit processing, packing&#13;
and marketing.&#13;
36.   Economic crop budgets have been estimated for each horticulture crop in each prefecture&#13;
(Tables 2 to 10). The ERRs range from 20 percent for Chinese dates in Yuncheng to 33 percent for&#13;
prickly ash. In an aggregated area model an overall rate of return of 25 percent has been calculated&#13;
(Table I1). The ERR has been tested for a drop in sales prices. A 20 percent lower fruit and nut&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-147-                           ANNEX9&#13;
price would lower the ERR to 22 percent and only a drop of 50 percent would bring the ERR close&#13;
to 12 percent.&#13;
37.   The climnate in the project area offers a comparative advantage for fruit and nut production.&#13;
The apportunity costs on the slope and bill lands are negligible. These areas cannot reasonably be&#13;
used for any annual crop and are too steep for terracing, but they provide good conditions for&#13;
perennial horticulture crops. The economic risk for the farmer is negligible, since he does not have&#13;
to give up any other economic activity. The investment is small and consists basically of seedlings,&#13;
fertilizer, and family labour. The inputs and operational costs again are low. On the other hand&#13;
even a small number of fruit trees provide a significant additional income.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 10: ALL CHINA WOMEN'S FEDERATION&#13;
Summary&#13;
1.    The All China Women's Federation (ACWF) is a national organization with representation&#13;
at all levels of government. The Federation's aim is to assist women to improve their skills and&#13;
earning capacity; Its committed and motivated staff work directly with their women in the&#13;
townships and villages.  Over the past six years in Luliang Prefecture the Federation has&#13;
implemented a Rural Women's Poverty Alleviation Project (RWPAP). The aim of the project is to&#13;
train and assist women in low-income families so that they can help other women in their&#13;
immediate neighborhood.&#13;
2.    Since its inception in 1989 the RWPAP has assisted women in 19,000 households and the&#13;
initial loan funds of Y2.6 million have been fully repaid and reinvested in new enterprises. Over 70&#13;
percent of the recipients have undertaken small livestock enterprises and many of them have&#13;
received their stock from the Federation's own livestock multiplication farms. Currently the&#13;
Federation operates farms for cashmere goats, breeding rabbits, lean pig production and caged&#13;
chickens. With the rapidly increasing demand in the national economy for livestock, these farms&#13;
have proved a valuable source of supply and the weaner pig farm included in this component will&#13;
add to this supply base.&#13;
3.    The success of the Federation in Luliang in helping women in poor households to raise their&#13;
incomes has received national recognition, and government funds have been provided for the&#13;
construction of a training center in Lishi. UNICEF has also provided training equipment and some&#13;
operational funding. The Federation's poverty alleviation program suffers from a shortage of loan&#13;
funds and presently only 20 percent of the women in low income households are receiving some&#13;
forn of assistance. The component will improve this situation by providing Y 3.0 million to be&#13;
used for loans to poor households.&#13;
4.    The main aim of the ACWF component is to assist in the development of small livestock&#13;
enterprises at the household level in Luliang Prefecture. These enterprises will provide a new&#13;
source of income for women without the need for additional land. In addition, such enterprises will&#13;
provide assets to secure loans in times of financial emergencies.&#13;
5.    The component will expand and diversify the existing livestock development programs of&#13;
the Federation through better access to weaner pigs, laying chickens and breeding rabbits.&#13;
Households will be offered loans to establish the small livestock enterprises and will be provided&#13;
with technical, financial and marketing training by Women's Federation staff. Participants in the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-162 -                          ANNEX 10&#13;
component will form a core of households through which technical skills and new sources of&#13;
livestock will become available for future expansion of similar enterprises at village level.&#13;
6.    The main features of the component will be;&#13;
(a)   the establishment of a weaner pig production farm in Luliang Prefecture.&#13;
(b)   loans to women for small pig, chicken and rabbit production enterprises.&#13;
(c)   the provision of technical, financial and marketing training for participating&#13;
households.&#13;
Weaner Pig Production Farm&#13;
7.    To increase the supply of weaner pigs for fattening, a farm will be established with an&#13;
annual production capacity of about 3,400 weaners. In recent years, the Women's Federation has&#13;
shown the capacity to operate successful livestock enterprises and competent technical staff have&#13;
already been selected to establish and operate the proposed farm.&#13;
8.    It is proposed to lease an existing pig farm in Lishi County and renovate and expand the&#13;
facilities. About 200 new pigsties, a water storage tank and one kilometer of road will be&#13;
constructed and the existing 10 pigsties, warehouse storage, feed processing room and worker&#13;
accommodation will be renovated. Construction cost will be about Y182,000 and the work will be&#13;
completed in the first six months of the project. Equipment purchase (YI 10,000) will include a&#13;
feed grinder and mixing machine, a water pump and fittings and a farm truck for feed transport and&#13;
livestock delivery.&#13;
9.    About 600 young pigs and 5 stud boars will be purchased from which a foundation stock of&#13;
about 200 breeding females will be selected. Artificial insemination will be used for breeding. It&#13;
has been estimated that the breeding females (sows) will have an average of 2 litters per annum and&#13;
about 17 piglets will be weaned from each mature sow. About Y 500,000 will be provided for&#13;
livestock purchase and feed /veterinary costs. After selecting the foundation stock the balance of&#13;
the pigs will be fattened for selling as pork at six months of age. This fattening exercise will only&#13;
take place in the first year and its revenue will be used to provide the required operating funds in&#13;
the second year before commencement of weaner pig sales.&#13;
10.   About 700 households will receive up to five weaner pigs at market prices from the&#13;
breeding facility and initially all will be fattened and sold for meat.&#13;
11.   While the above farm has been designed for the production of weaner pigs for meat, the&#13;
plan is to receive approval to sell young breeding stock. Presently government policies, in an effort&#13;
to safeguard genetic quality, control the sources of supply of breeding pigs. However, the existing&#13;
government farms are finding difficulties in keeping up with demand and unless new sources of&#13;
breeding pigs can be established there is danger that expansion of the pig industry will be limnited.&#13;
Well-managed piggery operations such as those operated by the Women's Federatfon will increase&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-163 -                          ANNEX 10&#13;
the supply of breeding pigs to farmers and the Federation's approach of using nucleus households&#13;
rapidly increase quality pig production.&#13;
Small Livestock Enterprise Loans&#13;
12.   The corner stone of the Women's Federation effort to alleviate poverty has been the&#13;
provision of small production loans to the women of poor households. The project will support&#13;
and further develop this capability by providing about Y 3.0 million for about 3,000 new loans.&#13;
Finance will be provided to low-income households (annual eamings less than Y 300 per capita) for&#13;
pig raising, egg production and rabbit rearing enterprises on repayment terms of 4-5 years.&#13;
Principal repayments received during the project period will be recycled into further loans. The&#13;
small livestock loans will be designed to acconmmodate a range of households with varying labor&#13;
availability and inherent skills. Within a target group of low income households (those with anual&#13;
earnings of less than Y 300 per capita), loans will be made for the purchase of pigs, chickens and&#13;
rabbits. Recipients will be first trained and then offered a loan based on their skills and the labor&#13;
availability within the household.&#13;
13.   About 800 loans will be provided for fattening weaner pigs for pork. The average&#13;
individual loan cost will be Y 2,375 and will provide for the purchase of 5 weaner pigs (8 weeks&#13;
old) and sufficient foodstuffs for the first year's operation. The borrower will provide a suitable&#13;
pigsty. The pigs will be expected to reach about 100 kg live weight within 26-30 weeks and will&#13;
then be sold on the local markets. The pig fattening operation will be a relatively simple enterprise&#13;
to manage with a low labor requirement. AWCF's experience with similar loans has shown a low&#13;
incidence of animal health problems and satisfactory profit levels. The larger profit from the first&#13;
year_s operation will be carried forward to pay for pig and feed purchase and this practice will be&#13;
continued in subsequent years. Loan repayments will be spread over five years and the enterprise&#13;
will self-sustaining thereafter. Annual profits are expected to be about Y 300-400 so raising&#13;
household income by about 25 percent.&#13;
14.   For egg production about 150 loans of about Y 2,000 will be made for the purchase of 110&#13;
day-old chickens and sufficient feed for the chickens. The borrower's contribution will be the&#13;
purchase of laying cages. The day-old chickens will be reared through to 16 weeks when laying&#13;
will commence. Each mature chicken will be expected to produce about 15 kgs of eggs and on&#13;
ceasing laying the chicken will be sold on the market. Past experience has shown that successful&#13;
egg production enterprises require high technical, financial and marketing skill levels. While the&#13;
gross labor input required is comparatively low, the quality of labor needs to be high. Young&#13;
chickens are susceptible to a range of ailrments and need careful attention. Feed quality is critical to&#13;
both growth and laying frequency and correct financial management is essential to ensure the&#13;
timely purchase of new chickens and future feed supplies. Marketing problems have been&#13;
experienced where producers were isolated and the Federation has developed a policy of grouping&#13;
egg producers. This approach attracts buyers to the villages, but also allows the producers&#13;
themselves to collectively market their produce in the towns or directly to large industrial sites.&#13;
However, notwithstanding the difficulties, the potential profits from an egg production enterprise&#13;
can be highly attractive and margins are sufficient to repay a loan in four years. Training will be an&#13;
important element of this component.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-164-                           ANNEX 10&#13;
15.   Rabbit production will be supported by 2,000 loans of about Y 400. The loan amount will&#13;
allow for the purchase of 5 females and I stud rabbit, planting of about 0.13 hectare of grass or&#13;
suitable fodder and a rabbit shed. Each female rabbit will be expected annually to produce 28&#13;
offspring that will be sold directly after weaning. While rabbit production is a simple enterprise to&#13;
manage with low investnents it does have a high labor requirement for harvesting and transporting&#13;
the fodder. Past experience has shown that about  110 labor days are required each year for such an&#13;
enterprise but returns to labor are about Y 9 per day and this is much higher than the normal&#13;
opporunity cost for such labor at village level.&#13;
Training&#13;
16.   The loan program will be supported by an extensive training program covering all areas in&#13;
the Luliang Prefecture. Using the existing Women's Federation central training facility in Lishi&#13;
and their 10 rural training centers, funds would be provided for the specific training costs and&#13;
materials required to support the project's loan program. Emphasis would be placed on providing&#13;
the appropriate technical , financial and marketing knowledge to potential loan recipients. Training&#13;
activities would be aimed at about 6,000 women during the project period. Livestock availability&#13;
will to a large extent dictate the training timetable but it is expected to be scheduled over a four year&#13;
period. Total cost of the training program would be Y 750,000. Eleven training courses a year, one&#13;
at each rural training center, would be provided throughout the project area. Each training course&#13;
wil Ibe run for 3 days and would cater for 150 trainees. The project will fund the cost of&#13;
accommodation, meals and training materials for the trainees and the wages for the teachers. The&#13;
courses will cover the technical, financial and marketing aspects of small livestock production&#13;
units.&#13;

ANNEX 11: AGRICULTURAL PROCESSING&#13;
Summary&#13;
1.    The agroprocessing component includes 22 enterprises, of which there are 13 in Yuncheng&#13;
and 8 in Luliang. These are expansions of existing enterprises except for four new enterprises in&#13;
Luliang. The expansions consist of adding new equipment in buildings on factory-owned land near&#13;
the existing facilities. This expansion of processing capacity adds value to the raw material&#13;
produced by the project, and the profits accrue to communities in the project areas. A reliable&#13;
market for their produce also gives the farmers more incentives to invest in higher yields and new&#13;
crops. Furthermore, the enterprises add to the local tax base and create employment opportunities&#13;
for managerial and technical staff, and off-farm employment for the farm households.&#13;
2.    The enterprises are mainly township and village enterprises (TVEs), a form of ownership&#13;
that is now common throughout China and can be seen as a transition between government&#13;
ownership and ownership by private individuals. TVEs are subject to market forces in procurement&#13;
of raw materials and the sale of finished products. The enterprises in this project plan to expand&#13;
production to meet well-defined market opportunities, and they will in most cases acquire&#13;
machinery that is more efficient and produces higher quality goods. Cost estimates are shown in&#13;
Table 1.&#13;
Yuncheng Prefecture&#13;
Jishan Guangong Distillery&#13;
3.    The distillery was established in 1988 as a township enterprise. The distillery produces&#13;
white spirit from sorghum and other locally available grains and rice husk purchased from other&#13;
provinces. The factory extension rill be located on an empty site about half a kilometer from the&#13;
existing plant. Buildings will include raw material storage, warehouse, bulk white spirit storage,&#13;
stores for packing materials, two packaging workshops, stores for finished products, a laboratory,&#13;
dormiitories and other buildings. The existing site will be modified to provide more space for spirit&#13;
manufacture and to move storage to the new site. The expansion will allow production to increase&#13;
from the present 1,000 tons to 5,000 tons.&#13;
4.    The distillery has won several awards and sells its products in 24 provinces of China and&#13;
reports exporting 60 percent of its annual production to Russia, Korea, Thailand, Hong Kong,&#13;
Macau, Taiwan and other parts of South East Asia. The Hong Kong Wang Li Brewery Company&#13;
apparently will be able to take 2,000 tons per year for export to other parts of Asia, another&#13;
company have signed a contract for the distillery to supply 1,200 tons of spirit, and at the China&#13;
Spring and Autumn Export Commodities Fair the distillery secured contracts for over 2,500 tons.&#13;
Local demand is 1,000 tons. The management, therefore, believes, with justification, that there will&#13;
be no difficulty in selling 5,000 tons per year. The investment cost is Y 10.7 million.&#13;

-166-                      ANNEXll&#13;
Wenxi Dehydrated Fruit and Vegetable Factory&#13;
5.    The factory started in August 1992 with a capacity of 400 tons per year of dehydrated&#13;
products. In November 1993 this was doubled to 800 tons per year, although the factory is still&#13;
working up to full capacity and will probably produce about 700 tons this year. With the present&#13;
production, drying is by hot air blowers. The main products are dehydrated Chinese onion, garlic&#13;
slices, carrots, Chinese cabbage and other vegetables. These are mainly sold to South Korea, Japan,&#13;
Singapore and Taiwan. The factory is a township enterprise managed as a collective. In 1993, the&#13;
factory broke even and in 1994 expects to make about Y 500,000 profit. The feasibility report was&#13;
prepared by the Shanxi Agro and Animal Husbandry Design Institute.&#13;
6.    The plan is to expand the facilities on a I ha site next to the existing factory. A new&#13;
building will be constructed and equipment installed to allow an annual production of 220 tons of&#13;
vacuum dehydrated vegetables and 500 tons of fruit and vegetable crisps. The investment cost is&#13;
estimated at YI 1.6 million. The factory anticipates selling all its production for export. A contract&#13;
has already been signed with a South Korean company to supply them with 3,000 tons of&#13;
dehydrated vegetables over a three-year period.&#13;
Jishan Date Processing&#13;
7.    The Company was established in March 1990 as a township collective enterprise. At&#13;
present, the factory produces about 500 tons of date products annually, composed of 100 tons of&#13;
ginseng-soaked date, and 200 tons each of honeyed date and sweetened date slices.&#13;
8.    The factory will be extended on the existing 18 mu (1.2 ha) with 4,500 m2 of existing&#13;
buildings by construction of a further 3,260 m consisting of processing area, workshops, cellars, a&#13;
boiler room and an electrical power distribution room. Total cost is estimated at Y6.5 million&#13;
(US$0.80 million). Production will increase by 2,300 tons to 2,800 tons. For this level of&#13;
production the intake quantity of dates will increase to around 4,600 tons per year.&#13;
9.    The factory has an agent in Guangdong and has good export links. The Jiangmen company&#13;
in Guangdong and other companies in Guangzhou and Zhejiang want to obtain a further 3,000 tons&#13;
of date products. Management expects exports to increase to 1,000-1,500 tons. Domestically, the&#13;
factory has developed a good market network and sells in seven provinces. Main markets are the&#13;
cities of Beijing, Taiyuan, Dalian and Xian and the corporation is having considerable success&#13;
selling its products .in railway stations and to airlines. The estimated cost is Y 6.5 million.&#13;
Jiangxian Hawthorn Processing&#13;
10.   The company was set up in July 1989. The present factory has a design capacity of 250&#13;
tons of hawthorn products, mainly hawthorn juice and some candied hawthom. However, poor&#13;
performance of the equipment and lack of working capital limit production of about 180 tons. Raw&#13;
material is more readily available, and processed haw fruit has a good market Planting hawthom&#13;
trees was encouraged by the county govemment which had a policy for each household to have&#13;
I mu (0.07 ha) of hawthom trees. By 1993 production of haw fruit in the county reached 6,000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-167-                       ANNEX 11&#13;
tons and the price which had been Y3.6 per kg in 1987 fell steadily to only around YO.4 per kg by&#13;
1993. As a result, there is strong pressure from farmers to increase processing capacity.&#13;
11.   For the extension, the factory would move to a 10 mu (0.67 ha) new site about 0.6 km away&#13;
from the present location. A 30-year lease has been signed for the site, that is next to the road with&#13;
piped water and electricity readily available. The new factory would have a capacity of 1,200 tons&#13;
per year of a variety of haw fruit products. Total investment cost is estimated at Y6 million.&#13;
Wanrong Dehydrated Vegetable Factory&#13;
12.   The factory, set up in December 1993, has the capacity to produce 300 tons of dried&#13;
vegetables per year. Up to September 1994 the plant had produced 75 tons of dehydrated&#13;
vegetables, mainly sold to South Korea and Taiwan. The plan is to establish a slaughter and beef&#13;
dehydration facility adjacent to the existing vegetable dehydration operation. It is proposed that the&#13;
beef dehydration unit will have an annual production capacity of around 100 tons from processing&#13;
440 tons live weight from 1,100 beasts. In addition, the extension will allow the vegetable&#13;
dehydration capacity to increase by a third to 400 tons per year. The cost of the extension is&#13;
estimated at Y7.5 million. The feasibility study was prepared by the Shanxi Food Industry&#13;
Institute.&#13;
Guanghua Food Processing Factory&#13;
13.   The factory, in Guanghua township of Wanrong County, was set up in 1990. It has&#13;
developed an excellnt reputation for candied fruiits. Annual production is 500 tons and the plan is&#13;
to expand this to 400 tons of dates, 300 tons of apples, 400 tons of haws, and 300 tons of apricot.&#13;
New equipment will be installed on a vacant site near the plant. The estimated cost is Y 3.7&#13;
million. The feasibility study was prepared by the Shanxi Food Industry Institute.&#13;
Yuanqu SiLk Reeling&#13;
14.   The mnill was set up in 1981 as a township enterprise and is under the Yuanqu Silk and&#13;
Cocoon Corporation which both assist households to produce silk cocoons and operates the mill.&#13;
Present output of the mill is 30 tons of white reeled silk per year on a single shift, which could be&#13;
doubled by introducing a second shift. About 300 households with one million mu (67,000 ha) of&#13;
mulberries supply cocoons to the mill, which also buys cocoons from other areas.&#13;
15.   The planned expansion has a number of components. Additional silk reeling equipment&#13;
will be installed with an annual capacity of 14 tons of white silk per year. This together with the&#13;
existing silk reeling equipment and introduction of a second shift will enable the reeling mills&#13;
production to increase to 70 tons per year. Machinery will be installed to produce silk cloth&#13;
including 24 looms for production of crepe de chine, 24 looms to produce other types of silk fabric,&#13;
and associated equipment. These will have a combined capacity of 60 million m2 of silk cloth&#13;
(equivalent to 56tons of silk) per year. The remaining 14 tons will be sold as reeled silk. In&#13;
addition, 55 sets of equipment for the manufacture of silk clothing. Finally, there the mill will&#13;
assist specialist silk- producing households. This will total Y1.5 million and include Yl million for&#13;
purchase of mulberry seedlings, silkworm eggs and tools, Y40,000 for improvement to the&#13;

Xiaxian Feedmill&#13;
16.   The company was set up by the Xia county Animal Husbandry Bureau in 1992. The&#13;
company operates commercially and assumes sole responsibility for profit or loss. The present&#13;
business is keeping 60,000 meat chicken (broilers) parent generation breeding stock, which in 1992&#13;
produced 11.2 nillion eggs, about a third of which were kept for hatching to provide day-old chicks&#13;
for local farmers and the balance sold to Guangzou. The company has a small existing feedmill&#13;
which produces 1,750 tons of chicken feed per year (0.5-0.75 tons per hour, or 5 tons per day); this&#13;
is inadequate for present feed needs of 2,160 tons annually. The business is housed in disused&#13;
police barracks transferred to the local govemment.&#13;
17.   A 30,000 ton animal feed annual capacity mill (100 tons per day) will be constructed on a&#13;
site adjacent to the existing poultry farm and mill. The plan is to produce 10,000 tons of chicken&#13;
concentrate feed, 10,000 tons of chicken compound feeds, and 5,000 tons each of pig and cattle&#13;
compound feeds. There are 14 small feed mills in the whole of Yuncheng prefecture with a total&#13;
production of 29,000 tons, which is about 5 percent of the prefecture's demand. There are no large&#13;
mills in the area, the closest being in Taiyuan and Xian. Construction of the mill will be part of an&#13;
overall plan for large scale broiler production. Total cost of the investment is estimated at Y5.3&#13;
million. The feasibility study was prepared by the Shanxi Construction Design Institute of the&#13;
Shanxi Feed Station.&#13;
18.   Wuhan, Sanmenxia and Chaoyang District have signed a contract with Xia county for the&#13;
supply of 2 million broilers annually. About one-third of the eggs produced by the company will&#13;
be used to produce around 2.5 million chicks. These will be supplied to 10,000 households for&#13;
rearing and fattening. The company will supply poultry feed totalling 12,000 and will collect and&#13;
sell the finished birds. This operation and the company's own poultry farm will, therefore, require&#13;
about almost half the new mills feed output. The balance of about 6,000 tons of poultry feed and&#13;
all the pig and cattle feed will be sold within the Yuncheng prefecture. At present there are&#13;
reported to be about 20,000 chicken producing households in Xiaxian.&#13;
19.   Marketing plans for the balance of poultry feed and pig and cattle feed are yet to be&#13;
developed, but given the reported scarcity of processed animal feed in Yuncheng prefecture this&#13;
should not prove a problem, so long as quality and price are acceptable to farmers. Raw materials&#13;
such as maize, oilseed cake, bran and bone meal are all readily available in Xia county and&#13;
surrounding counties.&#13;
Xiaxian Flour Mill&#13;
20.   The existing mill is long established, starting in 1964, and is the responsibility of the Grain&#13;
Bureau. Since 1989 the mill has followed a commnercial and market-oriented system of operation,&#13;
but profits have fallen in recent years due to old equipment, outdated technology, market demands&#13;
for high grade flour, and competition from a number of small new private mills. Production was&#13;
9,000 tons of flour in 1992, but breakdowns and lack of demand for a poor quality product has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-169 -                     ANNEX 11&#13;
caused output to fall to 5,000 tons. The present mill building will be rebuilt to house a flour mill&#13;
with a 14,000 ton annual capacity producing a range of quality flours. The flour produced will be&#13;
sold within the county prefecture and province. The feasibility study has been prepared by the&#13;
Zhengzhou Grain Institute. The mill, as a long established business under the Grain Bureau, should&#13;
have no problem to market the output or to secure adequate supplies of wheat. Xia county produces&#13;
90,000 tons of wheat annually. Total cost is estimated at Y8.3 million.&#13;
Wenxi Biscuit Factory&#13;
21.   The Wenxi Yicheng Biscuit Factory was established in September 1992 and produces 22&#13;
kinds of biscuit products. The factory is a Lingxidong township enterprise and the finance to&#13;
construct and start the company is reported to have been collected by private individuals. At&#13;
present the factory buys around 1,500 tons of flour and produces about the same weight of biscuits.&#13;
22.   The factory will move to a new site and be expanded by adding a mill with a 60 ton per day&#13;
capacity (in three shifts) milling 15,000 tons of wheat per year and producing 9,500 tons of special&#13;
flour for biscuit production. Initially, the company plans to sell the flour but anticipates that in five&#13;
years its own biscuit production will absorb the mill's output. Total cost is estimated at Y2.5&#13;
million. The feasibility study was prepared by the Shanxi Food Industry Institute.&#13;
Xinjiang Dehydrated Vegetables&#13;
23.   The factory is located in Nanzhuang village of Hengqiao Township, and is in an area where&#13;
the farmers specialize in vegetables. Its annual production is 400 tons of dehydrated tumips,&#13;
onions, cabbage, garlic and other vegetables. It has customers in Korea, Japan, Europe and the&#13;
USA. The plan is to expand production to 1,600 tons. Buildings and new equipment will be&#13;
installed on vacant land next to the factory. The investment cost is Y 4.7 million.&#13;
Yuncheng Flour Mill&#13;
24.   The mill, in the western suburb of Yuncheng City, began production in 1990.In 1994 it&#13;
processed 3,000 tons of wheat and produced 1,800 tons of specialized flours. Markets are&#13;
well-established in Taiyuan, Beijing, Shanghai and other cities. The plan is to expand production&#13;
to 12,000 tons of wheat, and 9,000 tons of flours. New equipment will be instalWled on a site close&#13;
to the plant. The estimated cost is Y 6.5 million.&#13;
Pinglu Fruit Packing&#13;
25. . The enterprise was set up in 1993 to pack apples for markets in Guangzhou and other cities&#13;
in China. It draws on local production of high quality apples, especially the Fuji variety which is in&#13;
demind in the domestic and export markets. In 1994, over 1,000 tons of beeswax coated apples&#13;
were sold. The plan is to expand annual capacity to 5,000 tons of wax-coated Fuji apples. New&#13;
grading, washing, coating and packing machinery, and temperature-controlled storage will be&#13;
installed on a site next to the existing factory.&#13;

Luliang Prefecture&#13;
Linxian Paperboard Mill&#13;
26.   The mill commenced operation in 1989, financed by a govermnent investment of Y2.3&#13;
million, of which Y1.20 million was as a poverty alleviation loan and YO.9 million from the&#13;
provincial SPC. It is the responsibility of the Linxian Township Enterprise Administration Bureau.&#13;
Present design capacity is 1,000 tons annually of corrugated paper, about half used for production&#13;
of 500,000 m' of boxes and the balance sold. In 1993, the mill is reported to have produced 935&#13;
tons of corrugated paper, of which 400 tons were sold as paper and 475,000 m2 of boxes.&#13;
27.   Main raw materials are wastepaper,wheat straw and purchased wood pulp. The mill has&#13;
signed agreements for purchasing waste paper from surrounding counties. Total supply is&#13;
estimated at 5,000 tons - of which the mill will need about 36 percent, or 1,800 tons. Present price&#13;
of com stalks and wheat straw, delivered to the mill, are respectively Y40 and Y80 per ton. Around&#13;
100 tons of wood pulp will be required. Present price is Y3,200 per ton (UJS$368 per ton). At&#13;
present, the mill can only make rough kraft suitable for the comugated core and buys better quality&#13;
kraft paper for facing. The plan is to expand capacity of kraft box paper by 1,400 tons per year and&#13;
increase corrugated cardboard for box making by 2.5 million m2, to a total of 2,400 tons and 3.0&#13;
million m2 respectively. Total cost is estimated at Yll.0 miUlion. The feasibility study was&#13;
prepared by the Shanxi Light Industry Design Institute.&#13;
28.   The present demand for boxes in Linxian is 7-8 million m2 The Linxian mill is the only&#13;
significant manufacturer of boxes in Luliang prefecture, which has a number of small plants with a&#13;
combined output of only 0.5 million mr.&#13;
Fangshan Oil Mill (New Enterprise)&#13;
29.   A number of oilseed crops are produced in Fangshan county, including rape seed, linseed,&#13;
mustard, sunflower and soybean. In 1993, 3,300 ha of oil seeds produced about 4,000 tons. The&#13;
county plans to plant an additional 2,000-2,700 ha to oilseeds and raise production to around 6,500&#13;
tons. Simple local processing by around 20 small simple, low technology mills consumes about&#13;
1,500 tons of the county's production. The balance of around 2,000 tons is presently sold for&#13;
processing in other areas. The quality of oil produced is poor.&#13;
30.   The plan is to establish a new mill in Madihui village. The mill will have an annual&#13;
capacity of 4,000 tons of oilseeds. Through a process of expelling, followed by solvent extraction&#13;
and oil refining, the factory aims to produce, 1,135 tons of cooking oil and 2,000 tons of oilseed&#13;
meal.Total investrnent costs are estimated at Y 4.4 million. The feasibility study was prepared by&#13;
the Shanxi Light Industry Design Institute.&#13;
Shilou Leather Factory&#13;
31.   The factory was established close to Shilou county town in 1991 to process goat hides,&#13;
which are readily available in the surrounding area. The plan is to expand output of leather and to&#13;
produce leather clothing. New equipment will be purchased and set up in new buildings adjacent to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-171-                        ANNEX 11&#13;
the existing facilities, together with a treatment plant for effluents. The estimated investment cost is&#13;
Y 2.4 million.&#13;
Xingxian Cereal Processing Factory (New Enterprise)&#13;
32.   This is a new enterprise, to be set up 7 km from Xingxian county town, to produce 2,000&#13;
tons of cowpea and grade and pack 1,000 tons of mung bean, 800 tons of red bean, and 200 tons of&#13;
other beans. It will be built on the site of an abandoned silkworm farm. Farmers in the area&#13;
specialize in these crops, but lack of a nearby processing plant depresses prices. There is a good&#13;
demand for the output of the plant in Taiyuan and other cities throughout China. The estimated&#13;
investment cost is Y 2.7 million.&#13;
Linyu Distillery&#13;
33.   The distillery, a township enterprise established in 1985, produces about 1,000 tons per year&#13;
of white spirit from sorghum, wheat bran, millet husk and other materials. Present production is&#13;
purchased by the larger and well-established Xinhuachun Fenjiu Distillery. Under a contract signed&#13;
in 1993, the latter will purchase up to 600 tons of distilled spirit in bulk each year. Last year the&#13;
distillery was awarded the Superior Quality Liquor designation by the Shanxi Province Township&#13;
Industries Bureau and demand exceeds production.&#13;
34.   The present location of the distillery is in a remote hilly area where water quality is good&#13;
and there is no other industry. The plan is to extend the facilities on an adjoining site of 2.6 ha to&#13;
enable the distillery to produce 1,000 tons more spirit and to bottle and package 40 percent of the&#13;
incremental production. A further 160 workers will be employed bringing the total staffing to 225.&#13;
The feasibility study was prepared by the Shanxi Light Industry Design Institute.&#13;
35.   The present contract with Feniu is attractive to the distillery because it enables them to sell&#13;
in bulk and they have no proper bottling plant. The addition of a bottling plant will make it&#13;
possible to bottle the balance of the incremental production (400 tons) and presumably the existing&#13;
production, also of around 400 tons. Since the product is of good quality and the market appears&#13;
buoyant, this will help to increase the distilleries independence and allow it to develop its own&#13;
lines.&#13;
Shilou Feed Mill&#13;
36.   The mill started in 1984 as a township enterprise with an annual design capacity of&#13;
800-1,000 tons of animal feed. In the last three years production has been around 1,000 tons&#13;
mainly chicken and pig feed. Annual sales value has been about YI million and net profit of&#13;
Y50,000. The mill will be expanded on its existing site. A 2.5 ton per hour mill will be installed to&#13;
produce 6,000 tons of feed per year working 300 days and 8 hours per day.&#13;
37.   Total investment is estimated at Y 2.96 million ($340,000), including incremental working&#13;
capital of Y 415,000 ($48,000). Total staffing of the mill will increase from the present 11 to 25,&#13;
mainly through employment of additional workers, clerical and maintenance staff. The feasibility&#13;
study was prepared by the Shanxi Light Industry Design Institute.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-172 -                     ANNEX I1&#13;
Liulin Date Processing Factory (New Enterprise)&#13;
38.   Chinese date production in Liulin in 1993 was around 3,000 tons and is increasing each&#13;
year. According to the feasibility report, about 8,000 tons were spoilt last year by mildew and rot&#13;
before they could be sold. Wild dates are also readily available in the area (around 340 tons) and at&#13;
present there is little processing capacity in the area.&#13;
39.  In 1993, the Liulin Date Developing Company (LDDC) and the Sanjiao Township&#13;
Enterprise Company (STEC) of Liulin county set up a joint stock company. So far the enterprise&#13;
has functioned mainly as a trading company. The company buys about 1,300 tons of date and sells&#13;
about half through three outlets, in North-East China, Zhejiang and Guangzhou. In addition,&#13;
LDDC has some experience in date extract and date juice manufacture. STEC has some experience&#13;
of smashed dates, candied dates and rudimentary packaging using a very traditional workshop.&#13;
40.   With their existing finance, the company has acquired a site and three buildings with a total&#13;
ground plan area of 1,000 m2 which are close to completion. The plan is to construct and equip&#13;
additional buildings with an of 2,000 m  The factory will produce 1,000 tons of graded dried&#13;
(25-30 percent moisture) and packed dates and 1,000 tons of wild Chinese date juice. The dried&#13;
dates will be tunnel dried and packed in plastic bags. The feasibility study was prepared by the&#13;
Shanxi Light Industry Design Institute.&#13;
41.   The main export markets are Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore. Soft drink production&#13;
nationally is reported to be 4.5 million tons and is projected to reach 6 million in 1995 and 10&#13;
rnillion by the Year 2000. Production of soft drinks in Shanxi is about 5 percent of the national&#13;
total and drinks are imported from other provinces.&#13;
Lishi Date Processing Factory (New Enterprise)&#13;
42.   The proposed new enterprise will be a joint stock company under the general corporation of&#13;
township enterprises of Lishi county. A board of directors is to be formed with five members who&#13;
will appoint a factory manager. The feasibility study was prepared by the Shanxi Light Industry&#13;
Design Institute. The factory will be housed partly in a disused slaughterhouse 7 km north of Lishi&#13;
and partly in new buildings to be constructed on the same site. Most of the old slaughterhouse&#13;
buildings will be demolished to allow construction of the new workshops but the offices, cold&#13;
stores, dormitory accommodation and service buildings will be retained.&#13;
43.   The expected annual production will be 400 tons of Chinese date (jujube) and a similar&#13;
quantity of jujube coffee. These two products have been developed by the Food Processing&#13;
Department of Luliang College. The products have attracted interest of both foreign and Chinese&#13;
food industry specialists and a patent has been obtained on the process. About 2.3 tons of date&#13;
coffee has been produced on a pilot basis for test marketing and as samples. At the Xianen&#13;
Economic Negotiation in July this year, the Zhenfa Private Limited Company from Singapore&#13;
signed a letter of intent to purchase 1,000 tons of jujube at a price of Y 30,000 ($3,450) per ton.&#13;
Total cost of the enterprise is estimated at Y 6.6 million.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-173 -                       ANNEX 11&#13;
Financial Analysis&#13;
44.   A financial cash flow analysis based on a 17-year period has been undertaken for all&#13;
agroprocessing plants in the project (Table 2). The weighted average financial rate of return is 28&#13;
percent and ranges from 18 percent for the Xiaxian Flour Mill to 45 percent for the Wenxi Biscuit&#13;
Factory. Most of the factories break even between Year 6 and Year 8.&#13;
45.   Three sensitivity scenarios have been modelled for each factory: (a) a drop in the sales&#13;
prices of 5 percent; (b) a drop in prices of 10 percent; and (c) a reduction in the production capacity&#13;
by 20 percent. The financial parameters of some of the factories are sensitive to a drop in the sales&#13;
prices. Particularly those factories with a low fixed costs and high turnovers that operate with small&#13;
margins. However, these type of enterprises would generally compensate by paying lower prices to&#13;
their suppliers of raw material. All of the factories would still be financially viable under a reduced&#13;
capacity of 20 percent. However, the Xiaxian Flour Mill would be just at the margin with a FIRR&#13;
of 12 percent. Most other factories could economically operate even at lower capacity rates.&#13;
46.   An expansion of the agroprocessing activities in the project area shows a number of&#13;
important economic benefits. Processing generally doubles or triples the value of agricultural raw&#13;
materials and a large share of this additional value would be kept within the region in the form of&#13;
employment and income. Processing of perishable agricultural raw materials such as fruits and&#13;
vegetables close to the place of production reduces significantly post-harvest storage and&#13;
transportation losses. For all products, transportation requirments are reduced and become less&#13;
time-bound. This is an important factor China where the transportation system is under pressure.&#13;

ANNEX 12: SOCIAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
Poverty Alleviation Programs in Shanxi Province&#13;
1.   In 1990, 50 counties in Shanxi were included in the national poverty program-&#13;
Help the Poor Fund. This program was renamed the "Eight-Seven Poverty Alleviation&#13;
Plan" which commenced in 1994 and aims to solve poverty alleviation for 80 million&#13;
people in seven years (by 2000). In 1992, the national criterion was set at 400 yuan per&#13;
capita and the provincial criterion to 500 yuan per capita.&#13;
2.    Shanxi is one of the poorest provinces in China. For isolated townships that lack&#13;
good infirtructure, the outlook for poverty alleviation is vezy bleak without outside&#13;
assistance.  The poverty alleviation strategy of the Shanxi Government focuses on&#13;
improvement of cultivated land, rural infiastructure, developing ural enterprises, and&#13;
diversifying agricultural production with orchards, livestock breeding and forestry.&#13;
3.    In Luliang Prefecture, 9 of 13 counties were included in the program in 1990 and&#13;
they have received Yuan 418.6 million as of 1993. In 1991, 5 of 13 counties in Yuncheng&#13;
Prefecture were also added to the program and they have received Yuan 44.3 million as of&#13;
1993.&#13;

Project Components and Benefits&#13;
6.    Figure 1 sunmmarizes the project strategy and logic for alleviating poverty in the&#13;
project areas-Yuncheng Prefecture and Luliang Prefecture. There are many factors that&#13;
are both the causes and symptoms of poverty. The IDA supported Project focuses on&#13;
addressing poverty related issues directly with investments in three areas:&#13;
(a)   agricultural development;&#13;
(b)   rural water supply and roads; and&#13;
(c)   agro-processing enterprises.&#13;
7.    There will be no investment in social services such as education or health because&#13;
there sectors are covered by existing programs; however, an indirect benefit is anticipated&#13;
because higher incomes can lead to a dramatic improvement in living standards, housing,&#13;
nutrition, health care and education. In this manner, the project should help to alleviate&#13;
poverty by directly raising incomes and imnproving living standards, and by ii,directly&#13;
benefiting social services which have been targeted by other programs. So rather than be&#13;
designed as a fully integrated project targeted at specific villages, this project aims to&#13;
augment an existing sector program for poverty alleviation that has identified subprojects&#13;
that can greatly benefit a large number of poor people.&#13;
8.    The project components for Yuncheng Prefecture include:&#13;
(a)   rehabilitation of the Langdian, Xiaofan and Zuncun pumping schemes and&#13;
upgraded irrigation system for 123,000 ha, which will benefit 750,000&#13;
people in four counties;&#13;
(b)   improvement of river beachland areas through investment in 1,250 tube&#13;
wells, land levelling for 13,000 ha, power supply and road construction,&#13;
which will benefit 450,000 people;&#13;
(c)   orchard developments covering 71,400 ha of cultivated land, which will&#13;
benefit 400,000 people;&#13;
(d)   livestock breeding of 39,000 cows and improved pastures for 130,000 sheep&#13;
in the mountainous areas, which will benefit 9,500 households;&#13;
(e)   78 rural water supply schemes for 516 natural villages, which will benefit&#13;
621,500 people and 118,000 livestock;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-178 -                   ANNEX 12&#13;
(f)   upgrading of six rural roads with a combined length of 202 Ian, which will&#13;
improve access for 185,000 people;&#13;
(g)   aquaculture development for 533 ha of fish ponds, which will benefit 6,150&#13;
people;&#13;
(h)   investment in 13 agro-processing factories, which will employ 2,000&#13;
workers; and&#13;
(i)   support for technical training and agricultural extension services.&#13;
9.    The project components for Luliang Prefecture include:&#13;
(a)   land terracing for 13,400 ha of slopeland, which will benefit 100,000 people;&#13;
(b)   construction of 56 check dams to prevent soil erosion, which can benefit&#13;
local farmers directly and reduce sedimentation and flooding in downstream&#13;
sections of the Yellow River;&#13;
(c)   planting of 4,200 ha of forests to protect against soil erosion;&#13;
(d)   orchard developments covering 21,300 ha of cultivated land, which will&#13;
benefit 120,000 people;&#13;
(e)   raising of 12,400 cows and grassland seed nursery, which will benefit 3,100&#13;
households;&#13;
(f)   204 village water supply schemes, which will benefit 63,900 people and&#13;
5,560 livestock;&#13;
(g)   upgrading of five rural roads with a combined length of 118 km, which will&#13;
improve access for 132,000 people;&#13;
(h)   investment in eight agro-processing factories, which will employ 1000&#13;
workers; and&#13;
(i)   support for technical training and agricultural extension services.&#13;
Baseline Socioeconomic Conditions&#13;
10.   Table 1 shows a comparison of the baseline socio-economic conditions in the&#13;
Yuncheng and Luliang project areas. The Yuncheng area has better agricultural land and&#13;
greater agricultural output, but it is spread over a population which is twice as large as the&#13;
Luliang project area. Since the Yuncheng project area encompasses the entire prefecture,&#13;
the statistics are improved by rural industry and economic activity around Yuncheng City.&#13;
However, the mountainous parts of Yuncheng have severe poverty conditions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-179 -                  ANNEX 12&#13;
11.   The Luliang project area is targeted at the poorest counties in a poor prefecture. The&#13;
poverty conditions relate to poor natural conditions, including serious soil erosion, drought&#13;
conditions, cold winters and lack of water resources. The population density is lower than&#13;
in Yuncheng but the poverty conditions in Luliang are widespread. This part of Luliang&#13;
Prefecture does not possess abundant rural industry; any of the large mines are State owned.&#13;
Rural Incomes in Yuncheng Prefecture&#13;
12.   The average annual net income for the rural population was 480 yuan per capita in&#13;
1992. This ranged from a low of 379 yuan in Pinglu County to a high of 574 yuan in&#13;
Yongji County. The higher incomes tend to reflect proximity to urban centers or mining&#13;
districts. Map la shows the distribution of rural per capita incomes at the township level in&#13;
1992. In 1993, income levels rose by an average rate of 22.1 percent, although the real&#13;
increase after inflation was only 8.0 percent. This was considered a good crop year because&#13;
the rain came at the right time; yields were 27 percent higher than in 1992. In 1994,&#13;
incomes rose again by an average rate of 28.5 percent, but since inflation was very high, the&#13;
real increase was only 4.1 percent. Fortunately, the farmers benefited from significant&#13;
increases to crop prices which enabled them to keep pace with the general cost of living. In&#13;
real terms (1992 prices), the 1994 per capita rural net income for Yuncheng was 540 yuan&#13;
and ranged from 415 yuan in Yuanqu County to 636 yuan in Yongji City.&#13;
13.   Table 2 shows the distribution of rural income groups in 1992. Only 2.4 percent of&#13;
rural households had a net income less than 200 yuan per capita but 9.9 percent were&#13;
between 200 and 300 yuan and 57.5 percent were between 300 and 500 yuan. 30.1 percent&#13;
of households earned more than 500 yuan although most of them earned less than 800 yuan&#13;
per capita. In 1993, one of the best years for crop output, almost 60 percent of the&#13;
households earned more than 500 yuan per capita. Map la shows that in 1992, 86&#13;
townships (41 percent of the 211 townships) were below the national poverty line and 140&#13;
townships (66 percent) were below the provincial poverty line. Map l b shows 1994 income&#13;
levels expressed in terms of 1992 price indices. In 1994, 41 townships (19 percent) of&#13;
townships were below the national poverty line and 99 townships (47 percent) were below&#13;
the provincial poverty line. Therefore, there was an improvement in income levels between&#13;
1992 and 1994 which is attributable to good weather, crop yields and grain prices; however,&#13;
a large number of rural people are still below the poverty line. In a year with a serious&#13;
drought, an estimated 70 percent to 80 percent of the townships and as many as 80 percent&#13;
to 85 percent of rural households could fall below 500 yuan per capita.&#13;
Rural Incomes in Luliang Prefecture Project Area&#13;
14.   The average annual net income for the rural population was 318 yuan per capita in&#13;
1992. This ranged from a low of 272 yuan in Xingxian County to 372 yuan in Liulin&#13;
County. Map 2a shows the distribution of rural per capita incomes at the township level in&#13;
1992. 104 townships (89 percent of the 117 townships) had net incomes below the national&#13;
poverty level of 400 yuan per capita.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-180 -                   ANNEX 12&#13;
15.  In 1993, income levels rose by an average rate of 23.9 percent but the real increase&#13;
was 10.2 percent. In 1994, income levels rose another 44.5 percent due to higher grin&#13;
prices. In real terms (1992 prices), the 1994 per capita rural net income for the Luliang&#13;
project area was 398 yuan and ranged from 316 yuan in the four project townships of Lishi&#13;
City to 435 yuan in Liulin County. Although this is an impressive 25 percent real increase&#13;
since 1992, there were still 82 townships (70 percent) below the national poverty line and&#13;
108 townships 92 percent) were below the provincial poverty line, based on 1992 prices&#13;
(see Map 2b). Significant increases were made in the counties of Lanxian (56 percent&#13;
increase) and Xingxian (52 percent increase), both situated in the northern part of the&#13;
prefecture. In a bad year, 95 percent of the townships are likely to fall below the national&#13;
poverty line.&#13;
16.   Table 3 shows the distribution of rural income groups in 1992. Only 6.9 percent of&#13;
rural households had a net income less than 200 yuan per capita but 32.3 percent were&#13;
between 200 and 300 yuan and 52.6 percent were between 300 and 500 yuan. Roughly 70&#13;
percent of the households fell below the poverty line (400 yuan per capita). Only 8.2&#13;
percent of households earned more than 500 yuan. When incomes rose by 24 percent in&#13;
1993, 82 percent of the households still earned less than 500 yuan per capita.&#13;
Socioeconomic Issues&#13;
17.   The following issues were identified and resolved after discussions with the PMOs.&#13;
(a)   measurement of incomes (village statistics versus actual household&#13;
incomes);&#13;
(b)   target groups for project investment/benefits;&#13;
(c)   farmer's labour inputs for the project;&#13;
(d)   project benefits and impacts on women;&#13;
(e)   inclusion or exclusion of social infrastructure in project;&#13;
(f)   public  consultation  and  participation  in  project decisions  and&#13;
implementation;&#13;
(g)   equitable allocation of project benefits (selection, operation);&#13;
(h)   cost recovery from rural beneficiaries for each projectcomponent;&#13;
(i)   surplus male labour in rural areas and seasonality of labour requirements;&#13;
and&#13;
(j)   funding for training and agricultural extension services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-181-                    ANNEX 12&#13;
18.   The following paragraphs indicate the status of public awareness, public&#13;
consultation, community participation and involvement of women.&#13;
Public Awareness&#13;
19.   Since the Poverty Alleviation Office has already been financing projects for ten&#13;
years in Luliang Prefecture and four years in five counties of Yuncheng Prefecture, many&#13;
rurl people are quite aware of the poverty alleviation program. During the process of&#13;
project preparation, four World Bank/FAO missions and two years of continuous&#13;
investigation by the PMOs have created widespread awareness for the project. The&#13;
township offices have been active in identifying candidate villages and households.&#13;
20.   Local television and newspapers have reported project activities on a regular basis.&#13;
The environmental assessment team has conducted a opinion survey of farmers,&#13;
administrators, technicians and intellectuals (refer to the EIA report). As of March 1995,&#13;
the social assessment team had conducted pilot surveys of 130 villages in Yuncheng and 70&#13;
villages in Luliang. The Yuncheng team had also done a pilot survey covering 156&#13;
households. Since then, larger surveys have been carried out to provide an extensive&#13;
database of baseline conditions for the project areas. Consequently, the level of awareness&#13;
is very high and the people are anxious to see the start of the project.&#13;
Public Consultation&#13;
21.   The Poverty Alleviation Office has involved all relevant line departments and local&#13;
government in formulating the project. In addition, they have had extensive consultations&#13;
with the general public. In March 1994, the World Bank mission participated in an&#13;
informal symposium with heads from local democratic political parties, intellectual&#13;
societies, and the ACWF. Although the purpose was to bring diverse groups together to&#13;
become involved with the project, it became clear that all groups had already been&#13;
consulted during the past two years and strongly supported the project.&#13;
22.   At the village level, public consultation has been underway for two years. Ongoing&#13;
consultation is required for the final selection of target households, and for project&#13;
implementation. Most farmers understand and accept that they will have to repay loans.&#13;
Careful consideration must be given to ensure that the beneficiaries include a wide spectrum&#13;
of households, while focusing on poverty alleviation. Also, the project will target women&#13;
as well as men for household schemes, particularly livestock and horticulture.&#13;
Community Participation&#13;
23.   Proper mobilization, motivation and organization is necessary to ensure high quality&#13;
construction and a feeling of ownership in the project. For the livelihood schemes, a&#13;
broader community approach will be taken although there may be few target households in&#13;
each village. This approach will provide learning opportunities for other villagers which&#13;
prepares the ground for future investments with local funds from savings or loans from the&#13;
Agricultural Bank of China. In China, the household responsibility system has developed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-182 -                  ANNEX 12&#13;
more individual attitudes amongst the farmers. Now, some blending of entrepreneurial&#13;
initiative and collective support is required for poverty alleviation to achieve maximum&#13;
benefits to the greatest number of people.&#13;
24.  In villages, it will be beneficial to target women who traditionally work collectively&#13;
on famiing and sideline activities. There is a women's representative in each village who is&#13;
responsible for awareness, organizing, and motivating the women. Through the ACWF,&#13;
access can be gained to training and demonstration programs and to small amounts of&#13;
credit.&#13;
The All China Women's Federation&#13;
25.   The Poverty Alleviation Office has years of experience working in conjunction with&#13;
the ACWF and training institutes, which can allocated responsibilities for project&#13;
implementation. For this project, the ACWF will be directly involved in implementation.&#13;
This will be done in an number a ways, such as:&#13;
(a)   targeting villages where the ACWF is currently working,&#13;
(b)   allocating funds to ACWF to organize and conduct training of women in the&#13;
villages,&#13;
(c)   seconding some ACWF staff to be attached to the county PMOs,&#13;
(d)   channeling some funds to the ACWF for on-lending to women, and&#13;
(e)   providing follow-up training in literacy, hygiene, and occupational skills that&#13;
compliment the initial livelihood component.&#13;
Project Beneficiary Selection Criteria&#13;
26.   The main criteria used to identify the investment components and project areas were&#13;
as follows:&#13;
(a)   per capita income levels of prefectures and counties,&#13;
(b)   exclude areas with existing internationally financed projects,&#13;
(c)   components aimed at improving agricultural incomes and sideline incomes,&#13;
(d)   components that enhance the socio-environmental land capacity,&#13;
(e)   components that have good prospects for cost recovery, and&#13;
(f)   components benefiting the greatest number of people per unit investment&#13;
cost.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-183 -                   ANNEX 12&#13;
Table 2 shows the selection for villages and households, by project component.&#13;
Monitoring And Evaluation System&#13;
27.   In order to evaluate the success of the Shanxi Poverty Alleviation Project, certain&#13;
criteria need to be monitored during implementation and after project completion. From the&#13;
socio-economic viewpoint, the following criteria and indices have been adopted:&#13;
(a)   Per capita rural incomes:&#13;
(i)   real increase in net incomes,&#13;
(ii)   percentage of households above the poverty line, and&#13;
(iii)   sources of income (income stability).&#13;
(b)   Rural employment:&#13;
(i)   number of days and wages for locals during construction, and&#13;
(ii)   number of people employed in enterprises and salaries, (the indices&#13;
should include a gender breakdown),&#13;
(c)    Rural living standards:&#13;
(i)   quality of housing and new house construction,&#13;
(ii)   household assets (farm machinery and consumer items),&#13;
(iii)   percentage of households with adequate potable water supply, and&#13;
(iv)    people with improved access to towns (via new roads).&#13;
(d)   Specialized households:&#13;
(i)   household equity and repayment of loans, and&#13;
(ii)   number of failures or additional loans and subsidies.&#13;
(e)   Local economic growth:&#13;
(i)   new enterprises and rural employment,&#13;
(ii)    wage income (full-time, part-time), and&#13;
(iii)   local investment in social infastucture (schools, clinics).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-184-                   ANNEX 12&#13;
28.  In addition to these socio-economic criteria, there will be project implementation&#13;
criteria such as irrigated area, new orchard area, new livestock, terraced area, new water&#13;
schemes, new roads, etc. For each component, the status of project implementation should&#13;
be measured in terms of percent complete, cost, quality, and number of people benefited.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation System&#13;
29.   The Shanxi Provincial PMO and the prefecture PMO's will have overall&#13;
responsibility for socio-economic monitoring and evaluation. Baseline data have been&#13;
collected and entered in database management systems by the Yuncheng and Luliang&#13;
PMOs. Income statistics and agricultural data have been collected at the county and&#13;
township levels. General statistics on income, living standards, health, education, and&#13;
agricultural production by crop have been compiled for each county. These data will be&#13;
updated annually by the Bureau of Statistics.&#13;
30.   A significant amount of data have been, and will be, collected and maintained by the&#13;
prefecture PMOs. The dBase software program is being used to manage the survey data&#13;
and generate annual reports at the prefecture level. The baseline statistics at the county and&#13;
township levels have been entered into Excel spreadsheets. These are adequate but&#13;
provision should be made to link statistics within each database. The system should remain&#13;
simple and user friendly to ensure transparency and access by the project supervisory staff.&#13;
The reporting formats should be simple and clear to assist the World Bank to review&#13;

Table 2: SELECTION OF PROJEcT TOWNSHIPS, VILLAGES AND HOUSEHOLDS&#13;
The following sections describe the criteria used to target beneficiary villages and households for livestock farms, horticulture, land terracing,&#13;
rural roads and rural water supply.&#13;
Livestock Farms&#13;
Yuncheng                                - Ist, select all townships in five poverty counties (S3 townships);&#13;
- 2nd, select poor townships in other counties (66 townships);&#13;
- 3rd, select poor villages in other townships (45 townships);&#13;
- 4th, select villages that possess good natural resources (e.g., 20 to 40 ha of natural pasture and&#13;
5 ha for herbage; or adequate farm residue and fodder).&#13;
Within these villages, between 2 and 10 households will be identified on the basis of those that:&#13;
- are poor (below 500 yuan per capita);&#13;
- agree to participate in the progran;&#13;
- have a young adult who completed junior middle school; and&#13;
- are capable of good animal husbandry management skills but presentdy have no livestock.&#13;
Lulig                                   Every township will identify 20 to 30 poor households for animal husbandry farms because all&#13;
seven project counties, and 112 of the 117 townships, are below the poverty line.&#13;
- villages that presently have no or few cattle;&#13;
- villages that have adequate domestic water supply;&#13;
- villages that have natural pasture or suitable land for improved pasture;&#13;
- households that have young adults with junior middle school education;&#13;
households that are capable of good animal husbandry management skills but presently have&#13;
no livestock; and&#13;
- households that agree to participate in the program.&#13;
Economic Tree&#13;
Yunchenz                                - i st, select all townships in five poverty counties (83 townships);&#13;
- 2nd, select poor townships in other counties (66 townships);&#13;
- 3rd, select poor villages in other townships (43 townships);&#13;
- 4th, select villages with suitable gullies and wasteland;&#13;
. 5th, select villages with less than 0.02 ha orchard per capita (i.e., less than 5 percent of&#13;
farmland except for specialized orchard areas).&#13;
Lulianz                                 - all seven project counties and 112 of the 117 townships are below the poverty line;&#13;
- all townships have abundant slopeland and gullies suitable for planting orchards;&#13;
- villages not having more than 0.03 ha orchard per capita;&#13;
- villages with good household candidates.&#13;
In Yuncheng and Luliang, the selection of households is based on:&#13;
- a contract on suitable slopeland, or cultivated land that will be intercropped;&#13;
- a young adult who has completed junior middle school;&#13;
- possibly some scattered fruit rees but no orchard land;&#13;
- good household enterprise management skills; and&#13;
- agree to participate in program.&#13;
Land Terracing in Luliang               - dispersed widely to Ill of the II7 townships in Luliang;&#13;
- villages agreeing to repay the capital investment;&#13;
- maximize the number of villages to benefit from mechanized terracing, subject to a minimum&#13;
terraced area of 2 ha; and&#13;
- a preference to villages with no village roads, yet accessible by bulldozer.&#13;
Rural Drinking Water Supply&#13;
Yuncheng                                - clusters of villages in dry areas that could access groundwater from a deep tube well and a&#13;
distribution network serving all villages;&#13;
- small isolated villages whose needs could be satisfied by nearby streams or springs using&#13;
gravity schemes; and&#13;
- most of the villages were selected from the hilly or mountainous areas where access to water&#13;
is limited, far from villages, and/or expensive to exploit&#13;
Lulianc                                 - 20 to 40 schemes within each of the seven counties;&#13;
- S of the 7 counties have allocated water supply schemes to every township, ranging from I to&#13;
S schemes per township; and&#13;
- each village is served by a single water supply scheme.&#13;

ANNEX 13: STATUS OF ENVIRONMENTAL&#13;
IMPACT ASSESSMENT&#13;
Status of Environmental Impact Assessment&#13;
1.    The Shanxi Poverty Alleviation Project consists of a number of subcomponents&#13;
covering a range of rural development, agricultural, and agro-industrial development&#13;
initiatives. Environmental screening has been completed for all project subcomponents.&#13;
For environmental assessment purposes the project is considered a "B" project. This&#13;
ranking was based on the observation that environmental effects associated with the project&#13;
are local in nature and pose no long term negative impacts. Furthermore the project is&#13;
considered to promote improved land management in poverty stricken rural areas.&#13;
Proactive programs on the proper use of agricultural chemicals and improved animal&#13;
husbandry, among others, will create opportunities for improving environmental conditions&#13;
in a number of areas.&#13;
2.    An environmental impact assessment (EIA) has been prepared by the China Institute&#13;
for Radiation Protection (CIRP) on behalf of the project management office (PMO). The&#13;
EIA considered a number of issues including the legal and regulatory framework for&#13;
environmental pollution control, the baseline physical conditions in the project areas,&#13;
potential process impacts from agroprocessing facilities and other project investments,&#13;
environmental costlbenefits assessment, and environmental management and monitoring&#13;
program. The report describes the main environmental concerns associated with each&#13;
subcomponent and outlines an appropriate mitigation strategy where required. Maps&#13;
showing the locations of all proposed activities have also been provided separately from the&#13;
main EIA report. Costs for implementing the environmental monitoring program are&#13;
provided in supplemental tables presented during appraisal. English translations of the EIA&#13;
report have been reviewed by ASTEN staff and their comments have been satisfactorily&#13;
incorporated into subsequent drafts of the EA report prepared by CIRP.&#13;
3.    The main conclusion of the ETA is that the project wiUl have minimal adverse&#13;
impacts while simultaneously promoting a number of environmentally positive&#13;
initiatives. The findings and recommendations of the EIA were evaluated and endorsed by&#13;
Chinese experts during a recent (May 1995) provincial review meeting involving technical&#13;
specialists from the Shanxi Provincial EPB, the National Environmental Protection Agency&#13;
(NEPA) and number technical design institutes. The recommendations contained within&#13;
the EIA have been reviewed and accepted by the Project Management Office. The EIA has&#13;
been submitted to NEPA and approved.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 189 -                     ANNEX 13&#13;
Summary of Environmental Impacts and Proposed Mitigation Measures&#13;
4.    Agro-processing Facilities. Adverse impacts of the project are, for the most part,&#13;
confined to the 21 agro-processing facilities which will be expanded or newly established&#13;
under the project. Of these facilities only three are considered to be potentially significant&#13;
polluters: the Linxian Paperboard Factory, the Shilou Tannery, and the Fangshan Edible&#13;
Oils Factory. The main environmental concems associated with these facilities are process&#13;
impacts such as air pollution generated from the operation of coal fires furnaces, disposal of&#13;
solid wastes, treatment and disposal of liquid effluents, control of dust and noise associated&#13;
with plant operation, and provisions for adequate workplace safety.&#13;
5.    For each of these sub-projects these issues have been reviewed and appropriate&#13;
environmental mitigation and monitoring measures have been recommended by CIRP. The&#13;
pollution impacts are considered to be of local concem and assuming pollution control is&#13;
carried out in a manner consistent with the EIA recommendations they should not pose any&#13;
significant incremental pollution problems All agricultural processing facilities financed&#13;
under this project will be required to meet or exceed relevant national and provincial&#13;
poHlution control standards. In addition, the approval, licensing, and siting of these&#13;
facilities will follow National, Provincial and Prefecture environmental review and&#13;
approval regulations.                              -&#13;
6.    In principle, the adverse impacts associated with the agro-processing facilities can&#13;
be mitigated through the use of readily available treatment technologies, waste management&#13;
procedures, and a careful analysis of alternative sites for new facilities. The mitigation&#13;
measures have been designed to ensure that sub-projects meet all relevant national and local&#13;
standards and that compliance is assured throughout the project implementation period.&#13;
Brief descriptions of recommended measures are provided in the main EIA report.&#13;
7.    Agro-processing facilities involving coal fired furnaces are required to meet&#13;
standards described in the National "Standard for Air Pollutant Discharge of Boilers&#13;
(GB13271-91)" and the "Air Environmental Quality Standard (GB3095-82). For these&#13;
facilities the principal air pollution control technologies will involve the installation and&#13;
operation of cyclone precipitators or water membrane scrubbers. According to the EIA&#13;
report, boilers with rated evaporation less than 4 t/h cyclone precipitators will be furnished.&#13;
For boilers with evaporation greater than 4 t/h water-membrane scrubbers will be installed.&#13;
Chimney stack heights as prescribed National Standard GB13271-91 (Air Pollution&#13;
Discharge for Boilers) will be provided. Tree planting has also been recommended at each&#13;
site as a means of reducing visual impact and of filtering airbome dust and particulate&#13;
matter.&#13;
8.    Waste water generated by processing plants will be required to meet the national&#13;
"Environmental Quality Standard for Surface Water (GB3838-88) ". In addition industry&#13;
specific standards for tanneries (GB3549-83) and paper making (GB3544-92) will apply.&#13;
The Linxian Paperboard Mill, Fangshan Refined Oil Factory, Shilou Tannery and the&#13;
Wanquan Dehydrated Vegetable Factories will be provided with comprehensive waste&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-190 -                      ANNEX 13&#13;
water treatment plants for water treatment. Proposed waste water treatment for the Shilou&#13;
Tannery and the Linxian Paperboard factory are described in schematic diagrams in the EIA&#13;
report.&#13;
9.    In facilities where dust levels are likely to be high dust bag filter systems will be&#13;
provided. Management of solid wastes will involve use of ash debris in road construction,&#13;
recycling of organic waste materials (use of fruit peels, vegetable leaves as fodder, use of&#13;
jujube pit in traditional medicines). Unusable solid wastes will be buried in designated&#13;
landfills. Financial allocation for equipment installation and operating costs have been&#13;
incorporated in the cost estimates for expansion or establishment of each plant.&#13;
Environmental Management and Monitoring&#13;
10.   Overall responsibility for ensuring project compliance with environmental&#13;
regulations and project objectives will rest with the project PMO. An environmental&#13;
monitoring unit (EMU) will be established within the central PMO and, where appropriate,&#13;
at the prefecture and county PMO levels. The central PMO unit will comprise a small staff&#13;
of technical specialists and will report to the provincial project leading group on&#13;
environmental performance in the project areas. In addition this group will provide&#13;
technical assistance and guidance on monitoring matters to the prefecture and county level&#13;
implementing units. The PMO-EMU will, to a great extent, rely on support from other&#13;
agencies involved with routine data collection such as the Provincial Environmental&#13;
Protection Bureau (EPB) at prefecture and county levels as well as relevant meteorological,&#13;
water conservancy, and public health departments at all levels (see Figure 1 SPAPO&#13;
Environment organization and management).&#13;
11.   The finalization of an appropriate strategy for monitoring environmental conditions&#13;
in the project area will be the task of the PMO-EMU. A framework for project&#13;
environmental monitoring has been proposed (Table l). Approximately 2.77 million Yuan&#13;
has been allocated for these purposes.&#13;
12.   A more detailed monitoring plan will be developed for the agroprocessing&#13;
subcomponents. For example, the monitoring plan calls for monitoring of process waste&#13;
water only once a year in the Shilou Tannery and the Linxian Paperboard Factory. Reports&#13;
documenting the level of environmental compliance achieved by each would be issued on a&#13;
much more regular basis (perhaps monthly) to the local EPB and to the PMO on a quarterly&#13;
basis. As a minimum each report would document performance in the following areas: air&#13;
emissions, solid waste management, liquid effluents, dust, and workplace safety.&#13;
13.   The frequency of sampling would be established on the basis of the variability of the&#13;
parameters at each site and can be modified according to actual operational experience.&#13;
Therefore each facility will need to refine its sampling methodology in collaboration with&#13;
EPB and the PMO. The main concerns associated with agroprocessing will include&#13;
tracking and monitoring fuel source utilization rates (including quality and quantity), air&#13;
emissions, liquid effluents volumes and quality, dust, noise, worker (and workplace) health&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-191-                         ANNEX 13&#13;
and safety shall be the responsibility of the individual plant. Routine checks will be carried&#13;
out by the local environmental monitoring stations of the Shanxi EPB. They will also assist&#13;
each plant in situations where specialized monitoring activities are required. The PMO will&#13;
also establish an environmental unit who will be responsible for periodic inspections of&#13;
facilities, management of overall pollution database for the project facilities, and other&#13;
environmental oversight tasks (see Terms of Reference for environmental unit) .&#13;
14.   A person(s) responsible for ensuring environmental compliance would also be&#13;
established within each factory. The agroprocessing facilities with the most significant&#13;
impacts (i.e., the Linxian Paperboard Factory, Fangshan Edible Oils, Shilou Tannery) have&#13;
already proposed internal management responsibilities for the operation and maintenance of&#13;
environmental mitigation measures. The other processing facilities will establish units or&#13;
designate responsible individuals before any construction activities are undertaken.&#13;
Depending on the size and complexity of the facility most agroprocessing facilities will&#13;
require from I to 3 staff responsible for ensuring compliance with environmental&#13;
regulations. Staff with relevant environmental engineering or pollution control experience&#13;
for these positions should be recruited. Where necessary, the PMO-EMU will ensure that&#13;
environmental staff of each facility are provided additional specific training to ensure they&#13;
are familiar with technical and administrative procedures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-192 -                      ANNEX 13&#13;
Terms of Reference&#13;
for Environmental Monitoring Unit in&#13;
Project Management Office&#13;
1.    The Shanxi Poverty Alleviation Project is a multicomponent rural development&#13;
project whose objective is to raise incomes within some of the poorest counties in Shanxi&#13;
Province. The objectives will be achieved through an investment program which aims at&#13;
diversifying agricultural activities in the project counties and through the provision of&#13;
critical rural infrastructure for irrigation, transportation, and drinking water supply. Many&#13;
of the project components are explicitly designed to reverse negative trends in natural&#13;
resource utilization (e.g. reduce reliance on groundwater extraction, promote in-situ soil&#13;
conservation, improve land management).&#13;
2.    As a result it is considered important that environmental conditions in the project&#13;
area be monitored closely as part of a comprehensive project monitoring and evaluation&#13;
plan to ensure that these positive objectives are being achieved.  To carry out the&#13;
environmental monitoring tasks an environmental monitoring unit will be established&#13;
within the central project management office (PMO) to oversee the environmental aspects&#13;
of the project. The environment unit will coordinate all monitoring activities to be carried&#13;
out in association with the construction and operation of agroprocessing facilities, the&#13;
development of the Langdian pumping complex and related development in the three&#13;
irrigation zones, the development of river beach lands in Yuncheng prefecture, the&#13;
construction and rehabilitation of rural roads, and the development agricultural lands.&#13;
3.    The unit will comprise a small core staff (1-3 people) to coordinate monitoring&#13;
activities to be carried out by implementing bodies and supporting documentation from&#13;
environmental protection bureaus at the provincial and prefecture levels. The core team&#13;
should comprise, or have access to, technical specialists in the field of environmental&#13;
engineering, pollution control, groundwater hydrology, and rural /agricultural land use&#13;
management. The unit will function as part of the overall monitoring and evaluation&#13;
function of the PMO and will report directly to the PMO director. The role and function of&#13;
the EMU should be continuously evaluated in order to ensure the work of the unit is&#13;
relevant and useful to the PMO director.&#13;
4.    The main tasks of the EMU will be to organize and implement the project&#13;
environmental monitoring program. Specifically, the EMU will:&#13;
(a)   Develop and implement a detailed environmental monitoring plan for each&#13;
project component. The core team will provide guidance to field monitoring&#13;
units on the data gathering and reporting formats to be used. Advising&#13;
facilities managers as to their responsibilities for environmental reporting&#13;
under the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-193 -                       ANNEX 13&#13;
(b)   Ensure that all agro-processing facilities to be supported under the project&#13;
meet or exceed relevant national pollution standards. The EU will ensure&#13;
that facilities installed and procedures established for the purposes of air&#13;
pollution control, wastewater treatment, and solid waste air operated and&#13;
maintained in accordance with design standards.&#13;
(c)    Maintain written documentation on the performance of all project&#13;
components relating to environmental aspects. Maintain an environmental&#13;
fact sheet and /or databases on each project component. The fact sheet&#13;
should include a brief description the component; base line conditions prior&#13;
to the project; predicted or expected impacts; mitigation measures proposed;&#13;
status of compliance with Chinese regulations; provisions for workplace&#13;
health and safety; training activities related to environmental monitoring and&#13;
management. These fact sheets will form the basis of supervision reports to&#13;
be presented to Bank supervision teams.&#13;
(d)    Carry out information gathering and organize periodic training seminars for&#13;
technical staff of agro-processing units related to environmental best practice&#13;
in factory operations. Research and seminars might include topics such as&#13;
low cost pollution control technology, new approaches to waste&#13;
minimization, waste recovery, pollution prevention, energy conservation,&#13;
and worker health and safety.&#13;
(e)    Carry out random "on-the-spot" checks of project facilities and activities&#13;
supported by the project to ensure compliance with existing regulations, to&#13;
ensure the safety of workplaces supported by the project etc.&#13;
(f)    Advise the PMO on any remedial or disciplinary actions which may be&#13;
required as a result of unanticipated environmental impacts of the project.&#13;
(g)    Coordinate with provincial and prefecture EPB and other providers of&#13;
baseline data.&#13;
