Report of the Committee under Section 4 (iii) of Article III of the Articles of Agreement on the&#13;
proposed Loan (Second Community Agricultural Resource Management and Competitiveness&#13;
Project) to the Republic of Armenia&#13;
The undersigned Committee constituted under Section 7 of Article V of the Articles of&#13;
Agreement of International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (the Bank) hereby submits its&#13;
report pursuant to Section 4 (iii) of Article III of said Articles in respect of the proposal that the Bank&#13;
grant to the Republic of Armenia (the Borrower) a loan in an amount of twenty three million United&#13;
States Dollars (US$ 23,000,000). The purposes of said loan are to: (i) improve productivity and&#13;
sustainability of pasture and livestock systems in targeted communities; and (ii) increase the marketed&#13;
production from selected livestock and high value agri-food value chains. The operation is also supported&#13;
by the IDA Credit in an amount equivalent to four million six hundred thousand Special Drawing Rights&#13;
(SDR 4,600,000).&#13;
1.    The Committee has carefully studied the merits of the proposal to grant such a loan, and of the&#13;
purposes to which the proceeds of the loan are to be applied.&#13;
2.     The Committee is of the opinion that the Project toward the financing of which the proceeds of&#13;
such loan are to be applied comes within the purposes of the Bank as set forth in Article I of said Articles&#13;
of Agreement, and that said Project is designed to promote the development of the productive facilities&#13;
and resources of the Republic of Armenia and is in the interest of the Republic of Armenia and of the&#13;
members of the Bank as a whole.&#13;
