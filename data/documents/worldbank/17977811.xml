&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Stephen, welcome back again. Letâ&#128;&#153;s talk about the reorganization of 1987.&#13;
&#13;
A:     I canâ&#128;&#153;t. Iâ&#128;&#153;m still in shock.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     I suppose it was very disruptive to you as it was to a lot of other people. I would be&#13;
&#13;
very interested, first of all, to get your views on the reorganization as such. Do you think&#13;
&#13;
that it was necessary? Why do you think it was undertaken? And did you think, apart&#13;
&#13;
from the problems of staff morale and the unhappiness that it created for many people, that&#13;
&#13;
it accomplished anything that was worthwhile?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Well, the answer is complex in the sense that there were certain things that were&#13;
&#13;
okay, and there were certain things that were not. Let me go back, first, to how it was all&#13;
&#13;
done, I mean, how the reorganization was set up and then talk a bit about the substance,&#13;
&#13;
and, finally, look at the impact on the staff of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
       It started with Barber Conable coming to the Bank as President in a situation in&#13;
&#13;
which it had been very difficult to get the budget through the Board. He came without any&#13;
&#13;
understanding of banking and without any understanding of development economics. He&#13;
&#13;
was a tax expert; he had been a Congressman with a very strong record on U.S. tax&#13;
&#13;
legislation. So he was numerate in that sense, but he had no sense of the Bank at all. He&#13;
&#13;
also came in with a clear mandate that he was to change the place, and that seemed to be&#13;
&#13;
very much what he was pursuing.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 2&#13;
&#13;
       So after he arrived he asked around as to whether we ought to change the place.&#13;
&#13;
The answer he received from a great many different sources, including sources inside the&#13;
&#13;
Bank, was that change was indeed needed. Then he engaged a consulting firm to&#13;
&#13;
investigate, and the consulting firm went around and talked to various people, both senior&#13;
&#13;
and junior staff, in the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Did you ever meet any of these consultants?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Yes. They asked me what changes I thought were required. And Conable, because&#13;
&#13;
people criticized him for coming in and changing the place before he understood anything,&#13;
&#13;
could quite legitimately say that all the changes introduced were introduced at the&#13;
&#13;
suggestion of the staff. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s one criticism you cannot make of the reorganization, that it&#13;
&#13;
was imposed upon us from the outside. Everything that was done in that reorganization&#13;
&#13;
was virtually totally self-inflicted, both in terms of its conceptualization and its&#13;
&#13;
implementation. Of course, the fact that Conable, not understanding the organization, took&#13;
&#13;
all these recommendations much too literally and without applying any critical judgment&#13;
&#13;
of his own. When people came to him and said: "We donâ&#128;&#153;t want to do this," or "We think&#13;
&#13;
that this is bad and in need of change," his reaction was: "Thatâ&#128;&#153;s what we are going to do."&#13;
&#13;
That happened, I found, both on the financial side and on the operational side. However--&#13;
&#13;
Q:     One aspect of his approach seemed to be that he systematically excluded a whole&#13;
&#13;
class of people from the exercise. For instance, he didnâ&#128;&#153;t involve Ernie Stern at all in the&#13;
&#13;
exercise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               2&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 3&#13;
&#13;
A:     Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. This is where you can find the seeds of some of the problems which&#13;
&#13;
occurred. It was the secrecy with which the reorganization was carried out, despite the fact&#13;
&#13;
that it was all done internally. The consultants came into the Bank, they talked around a&#13;
&#13;
bit, and then reported back to Conable and told him: "You are not coming in here requiring&#13;
&#13;
a change over everybodyâ&#128;&#153;s objections. Virtually everybody here wants change." And they&#13;
&#13;
were of course highly disparate.&#13;
&#13;
       The original plan was fine. There was a small group of handpicked people, and it&#13;
&#13;
really was small, I don't think there were more than 20 people involved. Jaycox was one of&#13;
&#13;
the principal people. They in turn picked those they wanted to work on this problem. As a&#13;
&#13;
result, you got a lot of like-minded people who were to do make a preliminary plan of the&#13;
&#13;
reorganization with the help of the consultants. The idea was that they would come out&#13;
&#13;
with a broad outline of the direction in which they thought the Bank ought to be&#13;
&#13;
reorganized. Then there was supposed to have been a substantial period for general&#13;
&#13;
comment. The broad framework was supposed to be exposed to people, so that those who&#13;
&#13;
were excluded from the task force could make their input. I understood that you could not&#13;
&#13;
include everybody in the task force, nor did I mind that I wasn't included, even though I&#13;
&#13;
thought the group was biased. I did not include people like me from the project side at all,&#13;
&#13;
because we were regarded as the defenders of the old regime. The study was clearly tilted&#13;
&#13;
against the sectoral side of the Bank. That didn't worry me because I trusted that there'd be&#13;
&#13;
opportunity for comment and a chance to debate about whether the direction of change was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              3&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 4&#13;
&#13;
right, before going to the second phase, which would work out the details. What actually&#13;
&#13;
happened, though, was that they did the first part and then decided to scrap the part where&#13;
&#13;
staff and managers would have an opportunity to comment on the outline. I blame Conable&#13;
&#13;
for this, more than anything else, although I donâ&#128;&#153;t know whether this was his personal&#13;
&#13;
decision, he was mainly putting pressure to complete the reorganization as quickly as&#13;
&#13;
possible. Conable approved the broad outline and the task force went straight into the&#13;
&#13;
detail, without consulting any people. I can remember this very vividly because I knew&#13;
&#13;
some people who were on the task force and who told me that they were arguing about two&#13;
&#13;
different models for project work organization. I made my views known, even though they&#13;
&#13;
were not invited, only to find later that comments were not needed because they had&#13;
&#13;
decided what they wanted to do and they were going off into the details at this stage. I&#13;
&#13;
think that was a big error.&#13;
&#13;
       The original motives for the reorganization were good motherhood-type ideas:&#13;
&#13;
decentralization, cutting out the bureaucracy, country focus, making people responsible,&#13;
&#13;
responsibility and accountability should go together etc. All of these ideas you can not&#13;
&#13;
really argue with, but in a financial institution you do need controls of some nature and this&#13;
&#13;
point was missed, namely that the more you decentralize the more there is an obligation for&#13;
&#13;
the people to whom you decentralize to report to and keep informed senior management. If&#13;
&#13;
senior management is doing everything itself in a highly centralized structure, you really&#13;
&#13;
donâ&#128;&#153;t need any reporting mechanism because the senior decision-makers know everything&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              4&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 5&#13;
&#13;
that goes on. If you decentralize, however, if senior leadership should remain in charge,&#13;
&#13;
then there is need for proper communications. That was not provided for. The people who&#13;
&#13;
designed the reorganization just got carried away by their theology and made a fetish of&#13;
&#13;
decentralization. They went beyond what I thought was in the interest of the Bank. There&#13;
&#13;
was no opportunity for the outside world to say "the emperor has no clothes" because the&#13;
&#13;
same people who had designed this thing went on and did the details of the implementation&#13;
&#13;
and, not surprisingly, became very defensive.&#13;
&#13;
       Let me give you one example, first, of what to me as a projects person on the&#13;
&#13;
operational side was a principal issue, and then, second, I will give you an example on the&#13;
&#13;
finance side which I came to discover later. On the operational side, you can look at the&#13;
&#13;
1987 organization as a simple continuation of the trend that had started with McNamara,&#13;
&#13;
well, even before McNamara, when the projects and the country side which had been two&#13;
&#13;
totally separate bits were gradually brought together in â&#128;&#153;72 into regions. â&#128;&#153;87 was in a sense&#13;
&#13;
just a continuation of that trend; even the regions had become too big, and agriculture staff&#13;
&#13;
should not be allocated to West Africa and East Africa but should be assigned to each of&#13;
&#13;
the 19 country departments into which the Bank was divided. So it was a natural move&#13;
&#13;
reflecting the growing size of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
       The trouble was that going from six to 19 was leading to absurd fragmentation of&#13;
&#13;
sectoral expertise; the critical mass of people to do a good technical job in 19 separate lots&#13;
&#13;
was simply not there. It was a plain error of numbers, and due, I think, principally to the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               5&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 6&#13;
&#13;
fact that the number of people with sector experience on the team were practically zero. I&#13;
&#13;
donâ&#128;&#153;t know who Kim Jaycox had that had that experience and it surprised me that he was&#13;
&#13;
the architect of this solution. The one issue on which I commented at the time, because&#13;
&#13;
some people had told me that they were looking at two models as to how to carry out this&#13;
&#13;
division, was the following. You may remember that there was a technical department in&#13;
&#13;
each region where they were going to keep a certain number of key specialists and then the&#13;
&#13;
rest of the sectoral staff would be divided amongst the country departments. There were&#13;
&#13;
two models discussed: One emphasized the critical mass as an important issue and&#13;
&#13;
suggested to keep the majority of the staff in the technical department, so that the&#13;
&#13;
agriculture division of country department X would only have in it maybe three or four&#13;
&#13;
people at most. The division chief, who wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t even be called a division chief, because&#13;
&#13;
he wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t have a division to command, would be the principal thinker about agriculture&#13;
&#13;
in that set of countries, assisted by another senior type thinking person, and maybe a more&#13;
&#13;
junior person to help everything run. The actual operational work would be contracted out&#13;
&#13;
to the TDs, i.e. all the appraisals, the sector work, and the supervision would be farmed out&#13;
&#13;
to the technical department, who would have a critical mass and would be able to keep&#13;
&#13;
some of the expertise because on a regional basis you could do that. But all the missions&#13;
&#13;
would in fact report for quality control purposes to the division chief in the country&#13;
&#13;
department and he would be the one who would look at the agricultural strategy and would&#13;
&#13;
determine what sort of projects should be supported. You wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t have a divisional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              6&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 7&#13;
&#13;
structure but a sort of country economic group which would include a senior agricultural&#13;
&#13;
person with a couple of guys to help and a senior transport guy with a couple of guys to&#13;
&#13;
help him etc. That was one model.&#13;
&#13;
       The other model, at the other extreme, didnâ&#128;&#153;t have a technical department at all. The&#13;
&#13;
argument was that the only way to achieve critical mass at all in any of the subdivided&#13;
&#13;
country groups was to divide everybody up and give country department X the biggest lot&#13;
&#13;
of agriculturalists you could possibly get out of this system. Donâ&#128;&#153;t waste any on the center&#13;
&#13;
because you need the maximum number at the country level and because thatâ&#128;&#153;s the only&#13;
&#13;
way youâ&#128;&#153;ve got any hope of retaining any expertise in the individual operations.&#13;
&#13;
       Now, I was asked to give my opinion about these two models, but on an informal&#13;
&#13;
basis because we were never asked formally. My view was then and remains today that&#13;
&#13;
both of these models could possibly work. But I said: "The one thing you must not do is&#13;
&#13;
compromise between these two. You must choose one or the other, because they can both&#13;
&#13;
work, but a compromise cannot work.â&#128;? The unfortunate thing was, of course, that that's&#13;
&#13;
exactly what they did, they compromised. They ended up with a middle-sized technical&#13;
&#13;
department and with middle-sized semi-autonomous groups in the country departments.&#13;
&#13;
That has been the root cause of an awful lot of our problems since 1987. It became the root&#13;
&#13;
cause of losing technical expertise, because with the small size of both units the tendency&#13;
&#13;
was to attract the generalists. Most of the divisions were still too small so there was an&#13;
&#13;
amalgamation of Education and PHN activities, which don't really have much in common,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              7&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 8&#13;
&#13;
and in infrastructure the water supply expertise was receiving short shrift because the focus&#13;
&#13;
was on roads and other forms of infrastructure. So I think that the planners of the&#13;
&#13;
reorganization made a bad choice by compromising that way.&#13;
&#13;
       The other big change they made of course was removing the checks and balances,&#13;
&#13;
the old system of quality control because the new central vice presidencies were relatively&#13;
&#13;
small but quite purposefully had no role whatsoever in providing any central quality&#13;
&#13;
control. Every one of the country department chiefs came from the country side and had no&#13;
&#13;
project work experience. Most of the senior projects people, such as the assistant directors,&#13;
&#13;
were got rid of one way or the other. The assistant director position of projects was&#13;
&#13;
abolished, which seemed to be one of the principal aims of the reorganization. Most of the&#13;
&#13;
former assistant directors were offered jobs at Level 26, as project advisors in various&#13;
&#13;
country groups. This gave them the option to take early retirement, which a lot of them did.&#13;
&#13;
This was completely the wrong approach.&#13;
&#13;
       I think that those two items were the key defects in the design of the new&#13;
&#13;
organization and this was something we inflicted by ourselves on ourselves, it was nothing&#13;
&#13;
you could blame Conable for. He accepted the views of the team without consultation with&#13;
&#13;
a wider audience. That was his error, if you wish, but it was not his design which was&#13;
&#13;
forced upon us, nor was it invented by the consultants.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Well, there was of course, in addition to Jaycox and his team of people who were&#13;
&#13;
doing most of the work, some steering group and McNamara was a prominent and vocal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              8&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 9&#13;
&#13;
member of that steering group. This group was being consulted, and was giving Conable&#13;
&#13;
encouragement.&#13;
&#13;
A:     I donâ&#128;&#153;t know anything about that. Maybe they should take some of the blame for&#13;
&#13;
what happened.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     You mentioned some problem on the finance side?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Well, I came across that problem earlier because I saw the finance part earlier than&#13;
&#13;
any other part of the final report because the report was kept very close. When Ernie was&#13;
&#13;
made a Senior Vice President for Finance under this arrangement, swapping jobs with&#13;
&#13;
Qureshi, he called me in. This was long before we were allocating jobs, even the Vice&#13;
&#13;
Presidents hadnâ&#128;&#153;t been chosen at this stage. He called me in to show me the bit that theyâ&#128;&#153;d&#13;
&#13;
done on the Controllerâ&#128;&#153;s side, and asked me for my opinion of the proposed arrangements.&#13;
&#13;
So I read this part of the report. I didnâ&#128;&#153;t realize at the time that he was actually offering me&#13;
&#13;
the Controller job because there was a mix-up of communications in the sense that he&#13;
&#13;
thought he was offering me the job whereas it had never occurred to me that he could be&#13;
&#13;
offering me the job. My mind wasnâ&#128;&#153;t set listening for an offer of a job, and therefore I&#13;
&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t react. But it turned out later that thatâ&#128;&#153;s what he was doing. But I focused at the&#13;
&#13;
proposed reorganization. There were two things on the Controller side which struck me.&#13;
&#13;
First of all, the old controllers department was being decentralized. The accountant staff&#13;
&#13;
was split up so that Treasurerâ&#128;&#153;s was getting its own accounting staff, the Investment&#13;
&#13;
Department would have its own, the borrowing side would have its own. This was totally&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               9&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 10&#13;
&#13;
against normal practice and so I went back to Ernie and I said: "This is dangerous. This is&#13;
&#13;
decentralization as a fetish rather than thought through. Mike Gillette, who had been the&#13;
&#13;
Director of Accounting, was actually on the team so it was, again a self-imposed idea. I&#13;
&#13;
told Ernie that this would amount to a complete loss of control over the finance side of the&#13;
&#13;
Bank. There were no arrangements for proper reporting and the different departments were&#13;
&#13;
totally independent. It would be impossible to produce centralized accounts, and the Bank&#13;
&#13;
had to have centralized accounts because the Bank works for the outside world as a single&#13;
&#13;
accounting mechanism. The other aspect of the arrangement was that by stripping down&#13;
&#13;
the controllers department, the proposal had downgraded the element of financial control&#13;
&#13;
in the Bank. The Controller instead of being a Vice President was made a Director, and&#13;
&#13;
with a few division chiefs there wasnâ&#128;&#153;t room for enough actual expertise in the&#13;
&#13;
organizational hierarchy. So when we got over the communication problem and I realized&#13;
&#13;
that Ernie was actually offering me the job, I told him I wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t do it, because I did not&#13;
&#13;
want to be responsible for something which I had no control over, when indeed I was&#13;
&#13;
supposed to be in charge of the accounts of the Bank. I also told him that since the position&#13;
&#13;
of the Director of Accounting in the middle had been removed, there was nobody in a&#13;
&#13;
senior position with accounting experience. I told him that I was not an accountant and I&#13;
&#13;
had to have somebody I could rely on who knew what the hell he was doing. As it turned&#13;
&#13;
out, they subsequently upgraded the job back to being a Vice President but they never&#13;
&#13;
restored the position of the Director of Accounting. One of the reasons why they did not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              10&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 11&#13;
&#13;
was because the Controllerâ&#128;&#153;s job was going to lose one-half of its function, which was&#13;
&#13;
looking after the loan disbursement department. The loan disbursement department was&#13;
&#13;
going to be itself decentralized in due course to each of the regions, so that each of the&#13;
&#13;
regions would not only do all its own lending but it would actually take charge of its own&#13;
&#13;
disbursements. That was another crazy idea, one that fortunately never came to fruition&#13;
&#13;
because the Regional Vice Presidents refused to go along and said this was a distraction&#13;
&#13;
from their basic function, and they already had too much on their plate. So the poor&#13;
&#13;
Controller was left with one department with a director and division chiefs and his other&#13;
&#13;
department, the Accounting one, which was really critical, he had to run without any&#13;
&#13;
intermediary between him and his division chiefs. His division chiefs were weak, and he&#13;
&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t have the time nor, as it turned out, the inclination to manage them closely.&#13;
&#13;
       But the fundamental problem was that decentralization became such a fetish&#13;
&#13;
without any proper reporting mechanisms and controls, that it became an unworkable&#13;
&#13;
solution. This is only just now, eight years later, being fully recognized and undone. Just as&#13;
&#13;
an aside, the person who was the Controller at the time of the reorganization was Hans&#13;
&#13;
Hitmeier, an Austrian. He and Ernie did not get on terribly well, and so initially Hans&#13;
&#13;
Hitmeier was told: "Well, you are going to be demoted to a Director because the Controller&#13;
&#13;
is no longer a Vice President." So, lo and behold, one Executive Director who went to&#13;
&#13;
town on the basis that the Controller ought to be a Vice President was none other than the&#13;
&#13;
Executive Director representing Austria. Why he should be interested in this otherwise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              11&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 12&#13;
&#13;
minor element? It was a sign of how Executive Directors got involved on the personnel&#13;
&#13;
side in this reorganization, because it was such a mess. He succeeded and got a lot of other&#13;
&#13;
EDs around who said: "No. This job really has to be a Vice President. You canâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
downgrade the accounting and control side of the Bank and all the money this is very bad."&#13;
&#13;
Of course, they didnâ&#128;&#153;t realize that with decentralization they were losing control anyway,&#13;
&#13;
and the job that remained with all the decentralization was such that you only needed a&#13;
&#13;
Director. But they didnâ&#128;&#153;t realize what was being done. All they saw was the Controller&#13;
&#13;
coming down to being a Director. So they won. Poor old Hans Hitmeier, who was on leave&#13;
&#13;
in Austria at the time, on two successive days got two different Telexes. The first one&#13;
&#13;
read: "Congratulations. Youâ&#128;&#153;ve won. The Board and the President have decided that the&#13;
&#13;
Controller will be a Vice President, not a Director." And on the next day, he got a Telex&#13;
&#13;
from Ernie saying: "Yes. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s true, but it isnâ&#128;&#153;t going to be you, because you are being&#13;
&#13;
fired." Or "not selected," which was the euphemism at the time. So thatâ&#128;&#153;s what happened&#13;
&#13;
to him.&#13;
&#13;
Q:        Instead, Ernie picked this Swedish fellow Suni Carlson. Where did he come from?&#13;
&#13;
A:        Well, thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. After I turned the job down, although it was never in a formal&#13;
&#13;
sense offered, he looked around for who the accountants were. One of them was, of course,&#13;
&#13;
Mike Gillette, who Ernie would not have picked ever, because there had been some little&#13;
&#13;
scandal on the accounting side which Ernie at least had blamed on lack of management and&#13;
&#13;
on Mike Gillette, rightly or wrongly. So he had no chance of coming back. I have always&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               12&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 13&#13;
&#13;
wondered whether that incident affected Mike Gillette 's handling of the financial side on&#13;
&#13;
the reorganization team, when there was nobody else who paid any attention to that, and it&#13;
&#13;
was a disaster. So Ernie continued to look around among the accountants and the only&#13;
&#13;
other one there was Suni Carlson, who had only been in the Bank for a year, as Auditor-&#13;
&#13;
General. He was a totally unknown character and had never done anything like running th~J1W8A~~s&#13;
&#13;
accounts of a large institutions.                                                                MAR 16 2011&#13;
               But that's where that came from , because everybody was in a mad hurrfXf5ption       B. ~1!:::;f1.0'&#13;
get the appointments made.&#13;
&#13;
       Maybe we should tum to the implementation side and the impact it had on the&#13;
&#13;
people?&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Yeah. Maybe at this point you want to tell us what happened to you?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Well, before that, I'll just describe in general terms what you must have heard from&#13;
&#13;
lots of other pe~ple , but just to be clear about the context of the whole reorganization. The&#13;
&#13;
arrangement was that the President would choose the four Senior Vice Presidents, which&#13;
&#13;
he did fairly promptly, and then those Senior Vice Presidents would pick their own Vice&#13;
&#13;
Presidents, which Conable reserved the right to approve. This was also done fairly rapidly&#13;
&#13;
because the numbers were limited. This was the process of selection being followed all the&#13;
&#13;
way down the pike. It was announced to staff that this was the way it was going to be done&#13;
&#13;
fairly early on. However, then there were considerable gaps between these appointments&#13;
&#13;
and it took a long time to get down to the individual staff. It took time to appoint all the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              13&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 14&#13;
&#13;
directors and then all the division chiefs had to be picked, before you would even start&#13;
&#13;
thinking about which staff were to go where, and the division chiefs themselves then&#13;
&#13;
amongst the staff made offers to people.&#13;
&#13;
       In the meantime, while all of this was going on, I was an assistant director of&#13;
&#13;
projects whose job had been eliminated and had no idea whether I was going to have any&#13;
&#13;
influence in the new organization or not. All my division chiefs at the time had no idea&#13;
&#13;
whether they were going to be reappointed or not, or in which function, so they were&#13;
&#13;
highly concerned. You can imagine that when you got down to the staff, at the bottom,&#13;
&#13;
they had no sense whatsoever and they did not know whether their existing division chief&#13;
&#13;
would have any influence to determine their future or whether they needed to find new&#13;
&#13;
patrons. All they knew that they were moving to an organization where theyâ&#128;&#153;d be totally&#13;
&#13;
beholden to their division chief for the goodness of having chosen them, as opposed to an&#13;
&#13;
institution where oneâ&#128;&#153;s career, at least in theory, was a question of oneâ&#128;&#153;s performance and&#13;
&#13;
experience.&#13;
&#13;
The net result was that my staff would not go on missions. They just refused. I can&#13;
&#13;
remember meeting with one staff member. I really had a need for somebody to go off and&#13;
&#13;
do something in the field in West Africa. He was somebody who I considered to be&#13;
&#13;
probably the best smallholder agriculturalist with intense knowledge of Africa that existed&#13;
&#13;
in the Bank at that time. There were probably two of them, and he was one of the two out&#13;
&#13;
of 150 agriculturalists working on Africa. His division chief reported to me that he did not&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             14&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 15&#13;
&#13;
wish to go on this mission. And I asked: "What have you got to fear? There is no chance&#13;
&#13;
that you are not going to be picked up, not even a fraction of one percent of a chance that&#13;
&#13;
you are going to be without a job." But he refused to go for two reasons: one, we were&#13;
&#13;
already partly down the pike and people were talking about the irrationality of some of the&#13;
&#13;
choices and matters had become very personal. By the time it get downs to the bottom,&#13;
&#13;
goodness knows, that I must be chosen because Iâ&#128;&#153;m the best one of the best does not&#13;
&#13;
necessarily follow. Second, he wanted to have some say and be here when they actually&#13;
&#13;
made those choices, because there were some division chiefs who might get appointed for&#13;
&#13;
the wrong reason and who I wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t want to work for. So he wanted to be here to&#13;
&#13;
influence the outcome and just refused to go on that mission. In one form or another,&#13;
&#13;
especially as you went down in quality the more people had to worry about whether theyâ&#128;&#153;d&#13;
&#13;
have a job or not. It meant that we lost nearly six months of work.&#13;
&#13;
       Now, as far as myself was concerned, I was first selected by Wilfried Thalwitz,&#13;
&#13;
who was the designated Vice President for EMENA, Europe, Middle East, to be the&#13;
&#13;
country director for Pakistan and Turkey, which I was absolutely delighted about because I&#13;
&#13;
had attempted to go on to the country side a couple of times at least in my career, both&#13;
&#13;
right at the beginning and then when Benjenk wanted me to become country division chief,&#13;
&#13;
strangely for the same country, Turkey. So finally here I was coming back to do what to&#13;
&#13;
me would have been a fitting end to a career. I mean, I would have been quite happy to&#13;
&#13;
have ended my career with a decent spot as a country director. He had to fight quite a bit&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             15&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 16&#13;
&#13;
because there were some people on that selection group who were against my being&#13;
&#13;
appointed, including particularly Shahid Husain. Shahid Husain was looking after Latin&#13;
&#13;
America and really thatâ&#128;&#153;s where I should have gone, Spanish is the only language that I&#13;
&#13;
speak fluently other than English. He used to tell me afterwards how it had proved&#13;
&#13;
practically impossible for him to select me as one of his country directors but that that had&#13;
&#13;
always been his intention. But other people in the group that were actually choosing these&#13;
&#13;
directors and sitting around with these Vice Presidents told me, and I believe them, that he&#13;
&#13;
actively objected to me being country director anywhere. But thatâ&#128;&#153;s perhaps more a&#13;
&#13;
comment about him than about the reorganization. Nevertheless, I was chosen, it was&#13;
&#13;
approved by Qureshi, who was the Senior Vice President for Operations, and I actually&#13;
&#13;
started work in the sense of selecting other people. I spent a happy week with Thalwitz and&#13;
&#13;
the other Directors who were appointed in the same group, and I appointed and&#13;
&#13;
interviewed about half my division chiefs. I used quite a bit of persuasion and old contacts&#13;
&#13;
to get good people to come in on various sector levels, people that I knew, and at the rate at&#13;
&#13;
which we were working weâ&#128;&#153;d virtually done this by the end of the first week.&#13;
&#13;
       That weekend, in fact that very Friday night, the Vice Presidents and the Senior&#13;
&#13;
Vice Presidents and Conable sat around together to discuss who the Directors on the&#13;
&#13;
formally approved list would be. The purpose was to sort out a few rough edges because&#13;
&#13;
some people had been claimed by more than one Vice President. For instance, I had also&#13;
&#13;
been approached by David Hopper. He had asked me whether I would like to be the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             16&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 17&#13;
&#13;
director of the budget, reporting directly to him, not through a Vice President. I had told&#13;
&#13;
him that I didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to be the director of the budget because Iâ&#128;&#153;d done my time in P&amp;B and&#13;
&#13;
as a program coordinator and I wanted to kick back into my operational thing. In any case,&#13;
&#13;
country department director was the job, as far as I was concerned, and so would he please&#13;
&#13;
understand that I actually wasnâ&#128;&#153;t interested in the job. I did not expect to hear any more&#13;
&#13;
about it. I thought that was the end of it. That Friday night, Wilfried called me at home,&#13;
&#13;
breaking all the rules, but very reminiscent of 1972, he called me at home and said: "You&#13;
&#13;
are going to be shocked by this news." He told me that Dave Hopper had put in his claim at&#13;
&#13;
this big meeting with everybody and had said he wanted me for P&amp;B and Wilfried had said&#13;
&#13;
he wanted me as country director for Pakistan and Turkey. Thereâ&#128;&#153;d been quite a discussion&#13;
&#13;
about that and the feeling was that there was nobody else who could do the budget job,&#13;
&#13;
literally nobody else that they wanted for the budget job. Yet, there was a whole line of&#13;
&#13;
people lined up to be country director. Therefore if I was moved to the budget job, Wilfried&#13;
&#13;
would have plenty of good people to choose from to be country director and therefore it&#13;
&#13;
was in the interest of the Bank that I should become director of the budget. "So," he said,&#13;
&#13;
"there you are. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s it for you to do what you want to do with."&#13;
&#13;
       Now, one of the principal people involved in the assignment process was Willi&#13;
&#13;
Wapenhans, who was the Senior Vice President for Administration and Personnel and who&#13;
&#13;
knew me quite well. So I called up Willi next morning, Saturday morning and told him:&#13;
&#13;
"Willi, you must not allow this." And Willi replied: "But you are the only person, Iâ&#128;&#153;m in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              17&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 18&#13;
&#13;
favor of you being in charge of the budget because you are the only person who can do the&#13;
&#13;
budget." But I said: "Willi, that is not true. Give me 24 hours and tomorrow morning I will&#13;
&#13;
call you and I will give you a list of three people, who in my view can take on the budget&#13;
&#13;
directorâ&#128;&#153;s job without any problem at all. If you look at that list and you can persuade me&#13;
&#13;
that those four people are clearly incapable of doing the budget and give me good reasons&#13;
&#13;
for that, then Iâ&#128;&#153;ll do the budget job." So he agreed. The next morning, having thought about&#13;
&#13;
this matter overnight, I called him up and gave him four names. The first one on my list&#13;
&#13;
was Bob Picciotto. I knew that Bob Picciotto was scheduled to be Technical Director for&#13;
&#13;
Latin America, working for Shahid Husain. I told Wapenhans that I had not spoken to Bob,&#13;
&#13;
but that I was certain that heâ&#128;&#153;d rather not do that job, and that if he were to ask him to be&#13;
&#13;
the Director of the Budget he would accept. I said that I knew him well enough to know&#13;
&#13;
that this would be his choice. I also told him that he was perfectly capable of doing the&#13;
&#13;
budget job, probably better at doing the budget job than I ever would be.&#13;
&#13;
        The second person I mentioned was Bill Humphrey, who was not being selected as&#13;
&#13;
a country director. I told Willi that Bill Humphrey could run the budget without any&#13;
&#13;
problem, although I did not know whether he would want to do that job.&#13;
&#13;
The third one on my list was Claude Blanchi. I told Willi that not only was he perfectly&#13;
&#13;
capable of running the budget of the Bank, but he had the additional attraction of being&#13;
&#13;
French in a situation where the Bank was being criticized for not having a single French&#13;
&#13;
director.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              18&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 19&#13;
&#13;
Q:      There was nobody on your list from the old P&amp;B department?&#13;
&#13;
A:      No. Because they werenâ&#128;&#153;t going that way. They really did want somebody who had&#13;
&#13;
operational experience. I thought I had given Willi a pretty good list.&#13;
&#13;
        So Willi agreed that he would look into the matter and get back to me. Now, what&#13;
&#13;
happened was that decisions were taken very quickly. On Monday morning, there was&#13;
&#13;
another meeting of the Senior Vice Presidents and Vice Presidents and Willi simply&#13;
&#13;
reported that I had told Willi that I would do the job if he said that I had to do it, and that&#13;
&#13;
he was just confirming that indeed I was the only person to do it and therefore the&#13;
&#13;
appointment should simply be confirmed. Willi made no effort to look into the suggestions&#13;
&#13;
I had given him or to tell me that he had given the matter any serious. In fact, of course, he&#13;
&#13;
hadnâ&#128;&#153;t had time to give it any serious thought and he hadnâ&#128;&#153;t talked to any of the people I&#13;
&#13;
had mentioned. Nor did he call me to tell me I got the job. Instead, David Hopper was the&#13;
&#13;
one who called me up at about eleven oâ&#128;&#153;clock on the Monday morning and his opening&#13;
&#13;
statement was: "Steve, Iâ&#128;&#153;m afraid youâ&#128;&#153;ve lost. You are coming to work for me as Director&#13;
&#13;
of the Budget. So, congratulations, and letâ&#128;&#153;s get together and start working on the details."&#13;
&#13;
And I said: "Dave, I thought I told you I didnâ&#128;&#153;t want the job." And he replied: "Youâ&#128;&#153;ve got&#13;
&#13;
no choice. Itâ&#128;&#153;s been decided and thatâ&#128;&#153;s firm." And I told him: "David, it takes two people to&#13;
&#13;
agree. Iâ&#128;&#153;m so disgusted. I donâ&#128;&#153;t want to do this job. I need time to think this through, so I&#13;
&#13;
am not accepting it here. I will think about it will call you back later in the day." I walked&#13;
&#13;
around the White House and various other places, just thinking through my options, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               19&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                    Eccles, 4125 /95, Page 20&#13;
&#13;
               decided that I'd rather leave the Bank than do another spell in that kind of work. I thought&#13;
&#13;
               that it really wasn't proper to do what they'd done, and if that's what they wanted, then they&#13;
&#13;
               weren't going to get me anyway, so that's that. I talked with my wife about it, and then&#13;
&#13;
               simply called him back at two o'clock in the afternoon and told him that I would not accept&#13;
&#13;
               the job. I reassured him that it was nothing personal that I would be quite happy to work&#13;
&#13;
               for him. I would be quite happy, for instance, to be his Director of the Environment. I'd&#13;
&#13;
               already taken a close interest in the environment. .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                              . But I was not going to accept the budget director job, I'd rather leave the&#13;
&#13;
               Bank. He was rather shocked at that, but he accepted that I really meant it and I didn't hear&#13;
&#13;
               anything more from him in a negative way. We were still on talking terms, although I&#13;
&#13;
               blame him for not having honoring my request to look for somebody else in the first place.&#13;
&#13;
                      And blow me! By the following morning Bob Picciotto had been asked ifhe would&#13;
&#13;
               stand in, because they were faced with a fait accompli, if he would do the budget job, and&#13;

MAR 16 2011&#13;
                                                                             But it was quite clear that they&#13;
&#13;
               could have done that on the Monday and everyone would have been happy, but they didn't,&#13;
&#13;
               and I was very much pissed off.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            20&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 21&#13;
&#13;
       Then, of course, things got worse rather than better, because two other things&#13;
&#13;
happened at that stage. Thalwitz, who had been told to look for another country director&#13;
&#13;
over the weekend, had not bothered to do that. When he heard that I had turned down the&#13;
&#13;
budget job, he went back to Conable and told him that he wanted me stills as the Director&#13;
&#13;
of Pakistan and Turkey. Why not? But Willi got into the act again, as I heard afterwards&#13;
&#13;
from Qureshi, and said that I had to be punished. There had to be some discipline in this&#13;
&#13;
whole reorganization. The division chiefs and everybody else had yet to be appointed and&#13;
&#13;
if people were allowed to have their choice, how could the Bank ever get going again. He&#13;
&#13;
accused Thalwitz of inciting me to turn down the job, because thereâ&#128;&#153;s no way I would have&#13;
&#13;
turned down the budget job if I didnâ&#128;&#153;t have a secret agreement with Wilfried Thalwitz that&#13;
&#13;
he would still take me, which was totally untrue. Thalwitz had told me as a definitive fact&#13;
&#13;
that I was no longer his director and everything I had done since then was totally of my&#13;
&#13;
own volition, and I never expected to get the country director job for Pakistan-Turkey.&#13;
&#13;
There was a slinging match between Willi and Wilfried in German on the twelfth floor,&#13;
&#13;
which was as far, I am told by at least one of the parties concerned who obviously spoke&#13;
&#13;
German and by another witness who was present, who though he did not speak German&#13;
&#13;
could sense that it was pretty brutal. Willi reportedly threatened to resign himself if I&#13;
&#13;
became the Director of the Pakistan/Turkey department. This was quite plausible, because&#13;
&#13;
Willi himself had told during the weekend that he had been selected as Senior Vice&#13;
&#13;
President for Administration and Personnel, against his own wishes. He told me: "Iâ&#128;&#153;m&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              21&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 22&#13;
&#13;
being told what to do. I donâ&#128;&#153;t want to do the job. But I have to do it. Why would the same&#13;
&#13;
not apply to you?" I didnâ&#128;&#153;t tell him that nobody was offering him anything else, and that he&#13;
&#13;
could have refused to take it.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Maybe he should have been Director of the Budget?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Yes, indeed. So Qureshi at this stage called me in and he was very charming and&#13;
&#13;
smooth, but he was also very straightforward. He told me that he would be quite happy to&#13;
&#13;
appoint me as country director. His original judgment had been that I could do the job and&#13;
&#13;
he had no reason to change it. But that he had a problem since Wapenhans was not&#13;
&#13;
prepared to go along and threatened to resign and that would cause a real ruckus. Here we&#13;
&#13;
were only at the beginning stages of the reorganization and things were already beginning&#13;
&#13;
to show the signs of tension that we were all too aware of. So, he had concluded that he&#13;
&#13;
had to sacrifice me. He was very straightforward about it; he didnâ&#128;&#153;t try to wrap it up in any&#13;
&#13;
other way. But he promised that I did not have do the budget and that I should not hasten&#13;
&#13;
to resign. By tomorrow you may get a call to offer you something that you will almost&#13;
&#13;
certainly want to take. I could not imagine what that might be, but I was quite prepared to&#13;
&#13;
wait and see.&#13;
&#13;
       In the middle of all this I found out that the British ED, who was Timothy&#13;
&#13;
Lancaster, had been weighing in. All the EDs were keeping track of where their nationals&#13;
&#13;
were going and the British thought that I was ending up not becoming a director. Lankaster&#13;
&#13;
called Conable and said that he thought that what was going on was anti-British and just&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             22&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 23&#13;
&#13;
not very good anyway. Anyway, the next day, the reason for the delay was that Ernie was&#13;
&#13;
not in town during this phase of the exercise, which was a pity, because I donâ&#128;&#153;t think we&#13;
&#13;
would have gotten quite so much nonsense if heâ&#128;&#153;d been around. But heâ&#128;&#153;d taken off&#13;
&#13;
somewhere, and Joe Wood, who was acting for Ernie because heâ&#128;&#153;d already been appointed&#13;
&#13;
as Vice President for Financial Policy, and heâ&#128;&#153;d been told by Qureshi about the fact that I&#13;
&#13;
was still in limbo. So, by the following afternoon, Joe had given me a call and I went to see&#13;
&#13;
Joe and Joe told me that Ernie wanted to give me the job as Deputy Treasurer or as director&#13;
&#13;
of the borrowing department. The Treasurer, Gene Rotberg, was leaving and Heinz Vergin&#13;
&#13;
did not want to be Treasurer but was going to be Acting Treasurer until they found a new&#13;
&#13;
Treasurer. I could have either job and it was for me to decide. So I hemmed and hawed a&#13;
&#13;
while, but not for very long, and decided work on the Treasury side could be great fun. It&#13;
&#13;
wasnâ&#128;&#153;t the same as being country director for Pakistan and Turkey, but nevertheless it&#13;
&#13;
wasnâ&#128;&#153;t the budget and it was a lot more. It was something I didnâ&#128;&#153;t know about, Iâ&#128;&#153;d learn a&#13;
&#13;
lot and, and it was operational and I would have a chance of actually doing something. So&#13;
&#13;
I accepted that job and moved over to Treasury.&#13;
&#13;
       But I must say, although I tried to work hard, I was not even seriously thinking&#13;
&#13;
about the Bank for nearly three months. I would appear at the office and would start&#13;
&#13;
reading up items and talking to people about what my new job was, but it was in a sort of&#13;
&#13;
daze and I couldnâ&#128;&#153;t concentrate on what I was doing. I was so incensed about what had&#13;
&#13;
happened, and so upset that I just simply lost my motivation. I would not have expressed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             23&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/25/95 , Page 24&#13;
&#13;
 any bitterness, if anybody asked me I would have denied it, but in fact I just simply could&#13;
&#13;
 not concentrate and it took me about three months before I really got into my new&#13;
&#13;
 assignment.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:     Rotberg had resigned at that point?&#13;
&#13;
 A:     Yes,&#13;
                                                                                 RESTRICTED&#13;
                                                                                WBG ARCHIVES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
 Q:     And they had to find somebody to replace him, I suppose.&#13;
                                                                                MAR816 2011&#13;
                                                                                         J.t&#13;
                                                                          Exception       t. ~vc~ Â·&#13;
 A:     Right. Heinz Vergin sat in as Acting Treasurer for six months, and then he went          ::P~.&#13;
 off.&#13;
&#13;
 Q:     So you were working with Heinz then?&#13;
&#13;
 A:     Technically Heinz was my boss for five months. Then I took over as Acting Vice&#13;
&#13;
 President and Treasurer until Don Roth came from Merryl Lynch. I was involved in his&#13;
&#13;
 selection and that was a good choice .&#13;
&#13;
. Q:    Now, the approach taken in the reorganization, this concept of having everybody&#13;
&#13;
 resign from the organization and re-recruit the people back into the organization is pretty&#13;
&#13;
 unique. It is sort of like a Zero Budget approach to personnel management. Have you ever&#13;
&#13;
 heard of other organizations who have done this?&#13;
&#13;
 A:     Well, it was a lousy way to do reorganize. But in fact people were not asked to&#13;
&#13;
 resign. Nobody ever put a resignation letter in front of anybody. The rationale was that&#13;
&#13;
 every job was new, there was no job that had not been changed as a result of the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              24&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 25&#13;
&#13;
reorganization. Therefore, staff had to be recruited to fill these newly created positions. It&#13;
&#13;
had the same effect because if one was not chosen, that was the end of your career in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank. People were just declared redundant under very favorable conditions, the packages&#13;
&#13;
handed out were a lot better than the standard package for redundancy. But the&#13;
&#13;
psychological impact on the moral of the staff was terrible and, in fact, Iâ&#128;&#153;d never heard of&#13;
&#13;
this being used anywhere else. In the 1972 reorganization, for example, a number of&#13;
&#13;
managers were affected, but it was the result of clear and quick decisions. On the day the&#13;
&#13;
reorganization was announced, August 12th in 1972, everybody had been told what jobs&#13;
&#13;
they were going to have and there was no choice in the matter. In any event, as far as the&#13;
&#13;
junior staff were concerned, there was no intention of declaring anybody redundant.&#13;
&#13;
       One of the errors in the implementation of the 1987 reorganization was that one&#13;
&#13;
was trying to do too many things at once. In particular, there was an attempt to make&#13;
&#13;
organizational changes, and at the same time reduce the staff. In contrast, the 1972&#13;
&#13;
reorganization took place in the context of an expanding Bank. Furthermore, there was no&#13;
&#13;
rationale for the reduction in staff; nobody was claiming that staff who were inefficient&#13;
&#13;
should be fired, nor was there any suggestion that certain activities should be eliminated&#13;
&#13;
and the staff performing certain functions eliminated.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     I understood that the process of staff selection was based on the concept that there&#13;
&#13;
was delegation of responsibility and accountability, managers could only be held&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              25&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 26&#13;
&#13;
accountable if they had in fact full freedom in appointing the people that they judged&#13;
&#13;
competent to perform the job they were given.&#13;
&#13;
A:      Which is nonsense. But that was exactly the argument put forward by the&#13;
&#13;
reorganization team.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      It was a decision which elevated nepotism to a legitimate principle of organization.&#13;
&#13;
A:      It was like saying that no general was in charge of his army because he didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
appoint every one of his commanders. Every bureaucracy has to operate with the staff&#13;
&#13;
resources it has acquired over time. Allowing managers to select their own staff had a&#13;
&#13;
devastating effect on the relationship staff had to the institution. Staff felt beholden to their&#13;
&#13;
bosses, and that has been in many cases in the ill-treatment of some staff who were told&#13;
&#13;
that they had to bear in mind that they owed their job to their managers. So while there was&#13;
&#13;
no formal step of telling people to resign as part of the reorganization, the effect on staff&#13;
&#13;
morale was perhaps even worse because of the informality of the process. If youâ&#128;&#153;d actually&#13;
&#13;
asked the people for their resignation, it would have made the resignation meaningless&#13;
&#13;
because everybody resigned. But the way the process worked, everyone was kept in a state&#13;
&#13;
of uncertainty, and the decision whom to select was largely up to the manager who didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
have to explain why he picked one person over another candidate.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Now, given that the reorganization took place and that there was an extended&#13;
&#13;
period of uncertainty and unsettled circumstances, and given some of the flaws that you&#13;
&#13;
have pointed out about the placement of project staff, how do you compare the Bank post-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               26&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 27&#13;
&#13;
reorganization with the Bank pre-reorganization? Do you think that it was effectively the&#13;
&#13;
same? Or do you think it was better or worse, in terms of efficiency and performance?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Well, the answer depends on what your measuring criteria are. There were, as you&#13;
&#13;
would expect, some definite gains. Country directors really were more in charge of what&#13;
&#13;
they were doing and had more authority than they had before to decide what was done in&#13;
&#13;
their country areas.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     And is it your sense that this resulted in more relevant assistance programs?&#13;
&#13;
A:     I think it was a mixed bag. I think in terms of relevance perhaps, but from a very&#13;
&#13;
narrow vantage point. In many cases these people were rather theoretical economists, they&#13;
&#13;
did not have a broader view of what is needed in a macroeconomic sense and what is&#13;
&#13;
needed in an institution-building sense and in a sectoral sense. I think that one of the&#13;
&#13;
reasons why our lending programs have stagnated since, is that you have not had that&#13;
&#13;
judicious mix of projects which we used to have. I also think that many of the economists&#13;
&#13;
who were managers put into country departments were not used to managing. Yet, they&#13;
&#13;
were in the key positions, much more important than Vice Presidents in my view; the&#13;
&#13;
country directors turned out to be the point for decisions in the Bank. Many of them had&#13;
&#13;
managed small economic programs and when they got into structural adjustment lending&#13;
&#13;
their responsibility had increased some. But managing a country department was quite&#13;
&#13;
another thing. Many of the directors had no notion about managing large numbers of&#13;
&#13;
people and getting things done, because that just simply wasnâ&#128;&#153;t part of their earlier&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              27&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 28&#13;
&#13;
function . I think that virtually all of the country directors were from that economic mold,&#13;
&#13;
Sven Sandstrom perhaps has been the only exception. The other 18 either had been chief&#13;
&#13;
economists who had generally no managerial experience or people running country&#13;
&#13;
departments of the old style, who were now put in charge of everything. That is one of the&#13;
&#13;
reasons, I think, why the Bank has become very expensive and very fat. There is a lot of&#13;
&#13;
waste in the Bank partly because the people who have real management control (a) do not&#13;
&#13;
have the experience of managing according to clearly defined priorities, and (b) find it an&#13;
&#13;
absolute bore. Most of them find it an absolute bore and do not want to spend any time on&#13;
&#13;
administrative matters. If you asked them are they interested, the answer would be yes, but&#13;
&#13;
in a real sense, do they show their interest by the time they spend thinking about&#13;
&#13;
management of and running an organization, the answer is no. So I think we do not seem&#13;
&#13;
to be doing things any quicker. Certainly there was less dialogue about projects because&#13;
&#13;
things were settled within the country departments. Do I think that all projects were&#13;
&#13;
therefore bad that came out? The answer is no . There were some new and inventive type&#13;
&#13;
projects that we hadn't done before, perhaps because the project side may have tried slow&#13;
&#13;
down change and innovation. Still, there were quite a lot of innovations going on before&#13;
&#13;
1987, perhaps not enough. It remains difficult to come to definitive conclusions.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     The Bank's performance also suffered presumably from the weaknesses of the&#13;
&#13;
managerial superstructure, the fact that Conable was not a hands-on m a n a g e r , _.CTED&#13;
                                                                                ~CHIVES&#13;

&#13;
A:     Right. There 's no doubt about that. Conable was the biggest failure, in my mind. I&#13;
&#13;
don't blame him too much for the reorganization except for the fact that he did not allow&#13;
&#13;
the design to run the way it should and have a period of public comment on the broad&#13;
&#13;
outlines before he instituted the details, which is the one thing that I thought was wrong.&#13;
&#13;
He was clearly not in charge during the picking of the people because he didn't know them&#13;
&#13;
and therefore he was totally at the mercy of the four Senior Vice Presidents that he picked.&#13;
&#13;
And he didn 't pick bad people. Ernie, Qureshi, Dave Hopper and Willi Wapenhans, his&#13;
&#13;
four people, were not bad peopl&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
-&#13;
However, the principal problem remained Conable and the factthat he did not manage his .&#13;
&#13;
four Senior Vice Presidents and allowed them to build up over a very short period of time&#13;
                                                                                              WBG ARCHIVES&#13;

their separate autonomous groups who could not sort out their differences . Conable was&#13;
&#13;
incapable of sorting out their differences, taking decisions and providing the leadership&#13;
&#13;
that was needed . This was by far his worst failure because the reorganization could have&#13;
&#13;
worked. All he did was to complain that the four Senior Vice Presidents were not taking&#13;
&#13;
an institutional view, but each one of them would defend their actions on the basis that&#13;
&#13;
they thought what they were doing was right for the Bank. When the reorganization was&#13;
&#13;
undone by his successor Lew Preston all he did was to remove the top set of people in the&#13;
&#13;
organization.&#13;

&#13;
Q:      Well, I suppose now we find you in the Treasury Department. And that, as you say,&#13;
&#13;
was a completely new experience, except for your assignment of checking around with the&#13;
&#13;
banks under McNamara which had brought you in contact with some of the banks and&#13;
&#13;
what they were doing.&#13;
&#13;
A:      Right. Except that I found that my previous bank connections had been with totally&#13;
&#13;
different banks. Then we were dealing with Citibank, Chemical Bank, Wells-Fargo, Union&#13;
&#13;
Pacific, whereas as the Treasurer you have no contact with the commercial banks, because&#13;
&#13;
one is dealing then with investment bankers who do your bond issues for you, Morgan&#13;
&#13;
Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch, or First Boston, those types of institutions, not&#13;
&#13;
universal banks. The only institutions which tended to be the same were banks overseas,&#13;
&#13;
Deutsche Bank, for example, which did everything. There I had some dealings with the&#13;
&#13;
same people. But basically I had to learn those relations from scratch. More importantly,&#13;
&#13;
there were a lot of issues that came up during my time in Treasury when we had to change&#13;
&#13;
quite a lot of things.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      But, I thought, this was one of the best run departments because of the great genius&#13;
&#13;
of Mr. Rotberg who took the Bank into the forefront of the financial market operations?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Yes, he did. But there was a lot of smoke and mirrors. I think the department was&#13;
&#13;
well run in the sense that we did borrow the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s money quite effectively. We defended&#13;
&#13;
the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s AAA rating, which enabled us to get very fine terms on borrowings. Those&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             30&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 31&#13;
&#13;
things were true and in that sense his reputation was well deserved and we made every&#13;
&#13;
effort to keep it that way.&#13;
&#13;
        Where matters were a little bit screwed up was when it came to the impact this had&#13;
&#13;
on our borrowers. We had been the first people to get into currency swaps, for example,&#13;
&#13;
and we continued that kind of innovation after Gene left. But the kinds of things that we&#13;
&#13;
had to change were things where, for example, on the lending interest rate. We had a single&#13;
&#13;
interest rate for all borrowers because we are a cooperative but that single interest rate&#13;
&#13;
applied whether we lent yen or dollars or what have you. And this issue came up in the&#13;
&#13;
early 1980s, where some borrowers were getting all dollars and our single rate was very&#13;
&#13;
cheap because the dollar was very expensive but we were lending it at seven or eight&#13;
&#13;
percent while dollars in the market were costing you 12 percent. Others were getting all&#13;
&#13;
yen and Deutsche Marks for which the interest rate should have been four or five percent&#13;
&#13;
while they were paying seven percent and suffering the appreciation of those currencies to&#13;
&#13;
boot.&#13;
&#13;
        We sorted that problem out by having the currencies pooled in the Eighties. After&#13;
&#13;
1981-1982, when we had the pool, everybody got the same mix of currencies, but then all&#13;
&#13;
the borrowers lost out because what we did is we kept the dollars to invest because we&#13;
&#13;
could get the highest returns on the dollars. So most of the dollars, not all, but most of the&#13;
&#13;
dollars were kept in our investment pool and we could boast as we made a lot of money&#13;
&#13;
because we were getting a return on the dollars which was commensurate with the interest&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              31&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 32&#13;
&#13;
on the dollars which were 10 and 11 percent. Yet the average cost of our borrowing and&#13;
&#13;
our lending rate was only seven percent. We were now totally fair between borrowers, we&#13;
&#13;
screwed them all equally because we gave them all the Deutsche Mark and the yen at this&#13;
&#13;
high rate. We had sorted out the long-term discrepancies among borrowers, but we had not&#13;
&#13;
dealt with the discrepancies between the Bank and its borrowers.&#13;
&#13;
       Now, Gene Rotbergâ&#128;&#153;s argument was it didnâ&#128;&#153;t make any difference because it was all&#13;
&#13;
one bank, and if you didnâ&#128;&#153;t make as much money on your investments youâ&#128;&#153;d have to charge&#13;
&#13;
more somewhere else and therefore it really did not matter. And to a certain extent thatâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
true. It was the hype that went around that was irritating, that the Investment Department&#13;
&#13;
was making money and therefore it was a good thing to keep a lot of cash on hand because&#13;
&#13;
we were making money out of it, which was simply not true. But in the end it did not really&#13;
&#13;
matter all that much whether borrowers paid a slightly lower interest, because the Bank&#13;
&#13;
made profits, the principal problem remained that the Deutsche Mark and the yen were still&#13;
&#13;
going to be out there appreciating and somebody would have to pay for them; the Bank did&#13;
&#13;
not take the foreign exchange risk, it passed it all on to the borrower. So it really didnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
make any difference.&#13;
&#13;
       However, we felt that that the system of transactions was not transparent, and it&#13;
&#13;
was better to be transparent. So we changed the rules in â&#128;&#153;89. It took two years to do, which&#13;
&#13;
is really quite quick when you consider that the new management of Finance didnâ&#128;&#153;t take&#13;
&#13;
over till May â&#128;&#153;87. By â&#128;&#153;89 we had thrashed all this out and we had changed the way we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              32&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 33&#13;
&#13;
computed our interest rate. We were now charging the interest rate which is applicable to&#13;
&#13;
the currencies we are actually giving out, and the Investment Department gets charged for&#13;
&#13;
the currencies that it actually keeps, and therefore itâ&#128;&#153;s performance is measured against&#13;
&#13;
that. Itâ&#128;&#153;s a fairer and more transparent way of handling funds.&#13;
&#13;
       We were at that stage relying in our borrowing operations far too much on a&#13;
&#13;
relatively small group of banks rather than being more open. People like Goldman Sachs,&#13;
&#13;
for example, were not allowed to be a part of our borrowing syndicates. We had a small&#13;
&#13;
group that we used all the time, and we never changed them. Nobody new could ever&#13;
&#13;
come in.&#13;
&#13;
In London we did quite well borrowing in the U.K. market. We always used Barings; we&#13;
&#13;
never used anybody else. It didnâ&#128;&#153;t matter who else came in with a good deal. If they came&#13;
&#13;
in with a good deal we would tell them to go to Barings and theyâ&#128;&#153;d come in jointly with&#13;
&#13;
Barings taking the lead and the person who had come up with a good deal taking second&#13;
&#13;
slot. To some extent that was really the flavor of the age, the emphasis was on the long-&#13;
&#13;
term banking relationship, rather than squeezing the last basis point out of the borrowing&#13;
&#13;
rate. But like everything else in the world things were changing and dealing in money was&#13;
&#13;
just like dealing in some commodities. Raising money was a business transaction and there&#13;
&#13;
was no particular advantage being stuck with the same person. You didnâ&#128;&#153;t get any&#13;
&#13;
favorable long-term deal, everybody was raising money in the markets on the same terms.&#13;
&#13;
The markets had become so open and certainly more competitive than they had been. So&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             33&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 34&#13;
&#13;
we began to open up and would deal with people like Goldman Sachs, who became a&#13;
&#13;
member of our group of banks.&#13;
&#13;
       I went for my training to Barings because I thought, I better learn something about&#13;
&#13;
the business. So I disappeared for a couple of weeks to sit with Barings where they could&#13;
&#13;
show me how the markets worked from their end. No, they didnâ&#128;&#153;t do derivatives in those&#13;
&#13;
days. But I must say that we had a monopoly then and they were quite happy to let me into&#13;
&#13;
things. When I came back, however, I didnâ&#128;&#153;t see why we were sticking with Barings all the&#13;
&#13;
time because they didnâ&#128;&#153;t strike me as being very imaginative and in fact they were, I&#13;
&#13;
thought, a little bit amateurish in the way they handled certain things. So I thought we&#13;
&#13;
ought to be opening up to more people. Barings had all been very happy to have the&#13;
&#13;
Deputy Treasurer to come and be trained by them, but the very next deal we did in the&#13;
&#13;
U.K. we didnâ&#128;&#153;t do with Barings, which was the first time we moved away from them. You&#13;
&#13;
can imagine that I was highly unpopular for doing that.&#13;
&#13;
       The other thing I did while I was Acting Treasurer before Don Roth came around,&#13;
&#13;
was allow IFC to do its own borrowing in the market. The previous Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Treasurer was&#13;
&#13;
dead against this, Gene Rotberg had been very much against it, Jessica Einhorn, who was&#13;
&#13;
the Number Two on the actual borrowing side, was dead against it, and Heinz Vergin was&#13;
&#13;
dead against it. But during the month when Heinz had gone and I was in charge, I agreed&#13;
&#13;
that IFC could go public and do their own borrowings, because I thought the arguments&#13;
&#13;
against this were crazy. I think everybody thinks it was right now, but at that stage I was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             34&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 35&#13;
&#13;
considered as being a bit of a traitor. This guy comes in who knows nothing about&#13;
&#13;
Treasury operations and goes and throws over one of our principal tenets, namely that IFC&#13;
&#13;
will drag us all down. In fact, IFC was able to get a AAA rating without any problem and&#13;
&#13;
IFC have done some quite good deals and have been very imaginative.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     You worked this out with Bill Ryrie or with Richard Frank?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Richard Frank. Bill Ryrie, I knew, had views on this subject but Richard was the&#13;
&#13;
one in charge. I just looked at the case and there was no argument to make. I sent over to&#13;
&#13;
Ernie Stern the formal memo from the Treasury which had been drafted for me by Jessica&#13;
&#13;
Einhorn that said that IFC should not be allowed to do this, and said: "Here is the Treasury&#13;
&#13;
view on this, but I donâ&#128;&#153;t agree with it." I talked to Ernie about it, and Ernie agreed that we&#13;
&#13;
should let them do their own borrowing. So that was quite pleasing.&#13;
&#13;
       One rather funny development concerned Jessica Einhorn, who was a Senior&#13;
&#13;
Advisor to the Funding Operations Department when I joined the finance complex. Thereâ&#128;&#153;d&#13;
&#13;
been a vacancy there for sometime and Heinz Vergin, as well as being Deputy Treasurer&#13;
&#13;
had actually been Acting Director of that department. Then when Gene Rotberg left, Heinz&#13;
&#13;
became Acting Vice President and this vacancy in the department was left open. As I&#13;
&#13;
mentioned earlier, Ernie had offered me the choice of either becoming the Director of the&#13;
&#13;
Funding Operations Department and actually raise the money or the Deputy Treasurer. He&#13;
&#13;
actually suggested that I should talk to the various people about the two jobs. So I went to&#13;
&#13;
see Jessica Einhorn and spent a couple of hours talking with her about things. My reaction&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              35&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                   Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 36&#13;
&#13;
when I came out of her office, was why she wasn't running the Funding Operations&#13;
&#13;
Department herself. So I went to Ernie and asked him why he would want me to run the&#13;
&#13;
department when he had a potential manager there who knew the stuff from A to Z and&#13;
&#13;
was perfectly capable in my view of managing the department. I'll be very happy to be&#13;
&#13;
Deputy Treasurer, which should be just fine by me, but don't let me take her job~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                              RESTRICTED&#13;
                                                                             Jessica was WBG ARCHIVES&#13;
&#13;
then promptly appointed by Ernie, who I think had asked me to go and see her precisely      MAR 16 2011&#13;
                                                                                                  6&#13;
                                                                                      Exception&#13;
because he thought that would be the appropriate choice. Obviously, she worked out quite              ($J::ij~Â·&#13;
well.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Now, that was the department for borrowing the money that had really the contact&#13;
&#13;
with all these banks?&#13;
&#13;
A:      That's right. They did the swaps and things of that nature. They would work out the&#13;
&#13;
specific transactions for borrowing.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      And then you had a separate department that invested these funds?&#13;
&#13;
A:      Oh, we had one group dealing with the investment of the liquid cash. We had about&#13;
&#13;
$20 billion worth of liquid cash. And that was run by Bernie Holland for a while and then&#13;
&#13;
Jean-Franyois Richard took over.&#13;
&#13;
Q:      And what was your responsibility as Deputy Treasurer?&#13;
&#13;
A little bit of everything?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                            36&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 37&#13;
&#13;
A:     I think one of the reasons why they had done away with the job was because they&#13;
&#13;
felt that there really wasnâ&#128;&#153;t a need for a Treasurer and a Deputy Treasurer. It turned out&#13;
&#13;
that there was a need, principally because we brought in somebody from the outside. When&#13;
&#13;
Jessica became Vice President, she did away again with the deputy position, because she&#13;
&#13;
really didnâ&#128;&#153;t need it. But I donâ&#128;&#153;t think that somebody like Don Roth would not have&#13;
&#13;
survived without a deputy, but he wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t have been as effective without a Deputy&#13;
&#13;
Treasurer who knew the Bank. So I used to take care of the administration in the broadest&#13;
&#13;
sense and keep track of all these people and see that they were doing a good job. I kept&#13;
&#13;
track of the Investment Department to see what sort of return they were getting, seeing to it&#13;
&#13;
that they were selecting the right benchmarks for measuring their own performance. I&#13;
&#13;
would also approve many of the borrowing operations, because only the Treasurer and I&#13;
&#13;
could sign off on these deals because the borrowing staff could not sign off because they&#13;
&#13;
were too close to the transaction. I used to involve myself very much in the financial policy&#13;
&#13;
area, the question, for instance, how the lending rate should be constructed, which had&#13;
&#13;
nothing to do with Treasury. But although Treasury had technically nothing to do with the&#13;
&#13;
financial policy formulation, Treasury had all the thinkers who were in a very good&#13;
&#13;
position to take part in policy formulation, and particularly when it came to the practical&#13;
&#13;
side of the business. The people that Johannes Linn had tended to chase after the "perfect"&#13;
&#13;
solution and would greatly complicate matters to make certain that to the last decimal point&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             37&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 38&#13;
&#13;
everything was fair. We would make sure that we ended up with solutions that were&#13;
&#13;
practical and workable.&#13;
&#13;
       This freed Don Roth to spend most of his time in building relationships with the&#13;
&#13;
people who were going to raise the money for us. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s what he brought with him from&#13;
&#13;
Merrill Lynch, knowledge about techniques for improving our borrowing operations,&#13;
&#13;
which I couldnâ&#128;&#153;t attempt to get into because I didnâ&#128;&#153;t have the experience. I learned much&#13;
&#13;
from him in this field. But when we talked about the financial policy of the Bank, then&#13;
&#13;
generally I would take the lead and he would always back me. He never really got into it&#13;
&#13;
and really couldnâ&#128;&#153;t care less about it. So I would deal with the Standard &amp; Poorâ&#128;&#153;s and&#13;
&#13;
people of that nature and make certain they all thought that we deserved our good credit&#13;
&#13;
standing. Q: Was Don Roth a good person to work with?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Don Roth? Oh, excellent. In a sense he operated very much like the private sector&#13;
&#13;
did. As far as he was concerned, he picked somebody to work for him and he was happy&#13;
&#13;
to have me. He didnâ&#128;&#153;t pick me but he was very happy with me. As far as he was&#13;
&#13;
concerned, you know, that was the way it was. He felt he could rely on me to talk to him&#13;
&#13;
about the things that really mattered. He felt very comfortable with that, and therefore&#13;
&#13;
would not attempt to interfere in what I was doing and would never get into the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
habit of the Vice President having to know everything about everything. When it came to&#13;
&#13;
financial policy he would turn to me if he wanted to talk about that. If he was busy he&#13;
&#13;
would just simply tell me to deal with matters as I saw fit. I think this is the way it should&#13;
&#13;

be. When you are in a managerial position you should be expected to handle your job by&#13;
&#13;
using your own judgment. The thought that as a Vice President I would have Directors&#13;
&#13;
working for me who I did not think were up to it or I trusted is just ridiculous.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Now, Roth didnâ&#128;&#153;t stay very long, though?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Oh, he stayed almost five years. When he was coming, he promised to stay&#13;
&#13;
somewhere between three and five years. It was never his intention to stay any longer. He&#13;
&#13;
actually had some political aspirations in the U.S. and if Clinton had not been elected, he&#13;
&#13;
might well have been a senior official in the U.S. Government. But his candidate, Bill&#13;
&#13;
Bradley, didnâ&#128;&#153;t even run in the end.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Now, you stayed with him for about three years or so?&#13;
&#13;
A:     I stayed til March 1990, so I stayed just a little short of three years. Once Iâ&#128;&#153;d seen&#13;
&#13;
him in, I wanted to do something else. One of the things that I of course wanted to do was&#13;
&#13;
to move back into Operations as a country director. I talked to Qureshi about that from&#13;
&#13;
time to time, but he never seemed to be able to pull things together in that way so it never&#13;
&#13;
happened. He did offer me the job that David Bock took in the end in his office, as his sort&#13;
&#13;
of chief staff. He was quite keen on me doing that and there was a promise that if I did that&#13;
&#13;
then after a couple of years, maybe, he would be able to put me back into a Country&#13;
&#13;
Director position. In the end I told him that I just was not interested in paying that price. I&#13;
&#13;
liked Qureshi but I thought his management style was just a bit too chaotic for me. In the&#13;
&#13;
end of course it, it would have no doubt led to what happened to poor old David Bock&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               39&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 40&#13;
&#13;
when Preston came in and did away with the Senior Vice Presidents and David was out of&#13;
&#13;
a job. Of course, he was looked after; they made him Director of some funny title in one of&#13;
&#13;
the other departments for a while until he left the Bank. But Iâ&#128;&#153;m very glad I didnâ&#128;&#153;t do that.&#13;
&#13;
       I was at that time looked after by Ernie and Ernie had asked me to be Vice&#13;
&#13;
President and Controller. I told him that Iâ&#128;&#153;d do that job but Iâ&#128;&#153;d rather actually be a Country&#13;
&#13;
Director still than being a Vice President and Controller. Ernie kept the job vacant for&#13;
&#13;
nearly six months after Suni Carlson left with Jim Jennings as acting Controller. I looked&#13;
&#13;
at various other options. One, as I said, was the idea of going back to operations and be a&#13;
&#13;
Country Director somewhere and the question was where and when. The other option was&#13;
&#13;
that I was asked if I wanted to be Vice President of Personnel and Administration. This had&#13;
&#13;
got started when Iâ&#128;&#153;d had another row with Willi in the context of my work on the support&#13;
&#13;
staff group which I had worked on for nearly two years. The group had been set up by&#13;
&#13;
Conable principally because he was dissatisfied with the Personnel Department because it&#13;
&#13;
really was a Personnel Department function. The Personnel Department should have done&#13;
&#13;
what I did, but I was dragged out to try and solve a problem because Conable was not&#13;
&#13;
happy with the way the Personnel Department was handling that matter. Therefore, the&#13;
&#13;
very existence of the group was a slap at Willi, and as a result, of course, he was not&#13;
&#13;
terribly pro and was in fact the only person, when the recommendations went up, who&#13;
&#13;
actually objected, but he was overridden. Despite that, when our Canadian friend, the&#13;
&#13;
Personnel Vice President Bill Cosgrove, disappeared to run for parliament in Canada, there&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              40&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 41&#13;
&#13;
was a question of who could take over that job. There were two candidates. Iâ&#128;&#153;d expressed&#13;
&#13;
an interest in it, because I thought that is something new I wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t actually mind doing,&#13;
&#13;
because I thought it needed sort of sorting out. And there was Bilsel Alisbah who was&#13;
&#13;
having discussions about that but was hemming and hawing and slow to decide. I thought&#13;
&#13;
he was going to turn it down. And just at that time Willi was dispatched elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
Conable did away with that Senior Vice Presidency and, instead, was just appointing a&#13;
&#13;
Vice President who would be reporting directly to him. Theyâ&#128;&#153;d approached me about being&#13;
&#13;
Vice President of Personnel and Administration because they knew I was interested on that&#13;
&#13;
and, and Bilsel had given the impression that he really didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to do this. I said: "Thatâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
fine, as far as Iâ&#128;&#153;m concerned thatâ&#128;&#153;s fine. Iâ&#128;&#153;d rather do that than be Controller, anyway. But&#13;
&#13;
Iâ&#128;&#153;d still rather be a Country Director." When the announcement came that Willi was&#13;
&#13;
moving, Ernie called me in said: "Well, strictly as a matter of formality, we feel that now&#13;
&#13;
that Willi has gone, we really ought to ask Bilsel if he still wants to turn down the job, or&#13;
&#13;
whether now that he doesnâ&#128;&#153;t have Willi on top and with a direct reporting relationship he&#13;
&#13;
would be prepared to take it.â&#128;? They were very surprised when he said yes, and I thought he&#13;
&#13;
started out very well.&#13;
&#13;
       They had asked me in fact who I thought could run not only the personnel function&#13;
&#13;
but sort out the new headquarters building project and ITF because all the systems were in&#13;
&#13;
a mess and had not been managed for a long time. I said there were only two people who&#13;
&#13;
could actually do that job and who were brutal enough to succeed. Bilsel's failing was that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
                 with personnel matters but there are times when you want a bit of a nasty guy, and Bilsel&#13;
&#13;
                 wasn't a nasty guy. So I said to Ernie: "There are only two people, in my view, who could&#13;
&#13;
                 actually do that job, and achieve what you want to do : I am one of them and the other one&#13;
&#13;
                 is Shahid Hussain. Shahid could sort that place out good and proper." He did agree with&#13;
&#13;
                 me in the end, although reluctantly I think, because I don't think Ernie and Shahid did get&#13;
&#13;
                 on terribly well.&#13;
&#13;
                           In any event, I took the Controller job just after Bilsel Alisbah was appointed Vice&#13;
&#13;
                 President for Personnel and Administration about December'89. By then I could see from&#13;
&#13;
                 my own side that there were so many problems as a result of the decentralized accounting,&#13;
&#13;
                 which of course I'd been against from the start. When I went to Treasury, one of the first&#13;
&#13;
                 things that happened after I got to Treasury was that they wanted to actually carry out this&#13;
&#13;
                 decentralization. Then I looked at it from a Treasury point of view and determined that it&#13;
&#13;
                 was wrong not only from the perspective ofthe Bank as an institution, but that it was crazy&#13;
&#13;
                 from a Treasury point of view. Just like the country departments had refused to become&#13;
&#13;
                 responsible for disbursements, I had come to the conclusion that I didn't want Bernie&#13;
&#13;
                 Holland and Jessica to have to worry about their accounting as well. Let that remain with Â·&#13;
&#13;
                 people who understand accounting. But I was overruled by Ernie. Ernie was a faithful&#13;
&#13;
                 soldier. It turned out after the event that he didn't believe in it either, but he had had so&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                42&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Eccles, 4/25/95 , Page 43&#13;
&#13;
many rows with Conable on the subject where Conable had simply said: "It's in the report.&#13;
&#13;
It says that we are going to do it. We are going to do it." I didn't find that out until after&#13;
&#13;
Conable went, but it turned out to be true, but Ernie would never hint at his disagreement&#13;
&#13;
with Conable that just wasn't the way he worked. As far as he was concerned, if he had to,&#13;
&#13;
if he had to do it. He wasn't going to resign rather than do it, he wasn't going to pass the&#13;
&#13;
buck to Conable, he was just simply going to do as he had been told. And so I was a bit&#13;
&#13;
angry about it because I got hit on the head very firmly and in public told to decentralize.&#13;
&#13;
        We were also supposed to decentralize the payroll accounting to personnel and&#13;
&#13;
travel accounting to GSD, but that hadn't happened because nobody was ready on the other&#13;
&#13;
side of that. Bilsel didn't want it, so he was dragging his feet, and he didn't have an Ernie at&#13;
&#13;
the top of him.&#13;
&#13;
        When I became Controller, I was put there not because I was an accountant but&#13;
&#13;
because there was need for a manager. There were some real managerial problems there&#13;
&#13;
which I could clearly see from elsewhere in the finance complex.&#13;

&#13;
       I went up there in March 1990. I insisted on there being a director of accounting.&#13;
&#13;
As you may recall when I told you about the reorganization in 1987 I saw in theory that I&#13;
&#13;
could not be Controller as a non-accountant without having a director of accounting who&#13;
&#13;
was an accountant, or whoâ&#128;&#153;d had some familiarity with that. So my prize for going up&#13;
&#13;
there was that there was in fact a director of accounting. It happened that I got one: Mike&#13;
&#13;
Ruddy. I went up there because Ernie was of the view that it was better to have a Vice&#13;
&#13;
President there who understood the Bank than somebody from the outside.&#13;
&#13;
       One reason that it took me a fair amount of time to make up my mind about that job&#13;
&#13;
was that I realized that once I went over there, that would take me to the end of my career&#13;
&#13;
in the Bank because I will stay for three years and this will take me up to age 55. I might&#13;
&#13;
stretch it til I reach the Rule of 85, which is four and a half years, but basically once I go&#13;
&#13;
that route, there really is no time left to work my way up to becoming a Regional Vice&#13;
&#13;
President. I realized that I would be bored in three years in this job; I would have sorted&#13;
&#13;
out the managerial problems, and once they are sorted out, accounting itself does not&#13;
&#13;
enthuse me. But I thought I did not really have to worry because I wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t mind retiring&#13;
&#13;
early anyway. Iâ&#128;&#153;d given up the idea of being Country Director by then, so I went into that&#13;
&#13;
job knowing that while I could technically stay around indefinitely, I started adapting my&#13;
&#13;
life to the fact that somewhere around â&#128;&#153;93, â&#128;&#153;95 I would leave the Bank because in a sense&#13;
&#13;
the management of the Bank put me into positions where really there was nothing left to&#13;
&#13;
do for me. That was sad, but fine.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               44&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 45&#13;
&#13;
Q:      Now, you did clean up whatever mess there was?&#13;
&#13;
A:      I cleaned up a lot. There are still some things that need to be done, but itâ&#128;&#153;s vastly&#13;
&#13;
different now than it was, and morale is a lot better. Nobody needs to be ashamed of being&#13;
&#13;
part of Controllerâ&#128;&#153;s anymore. There are some people in the Loan Department that have&#13;
&#13;
been there for an excessive period. It was a dumping ground for people whoâ&#128;&#153;d been shifted&#13;
&#13;
out of other jobs. But we have started to deal with that. There was nothing wrong with the&#13;
&#13;
accounts, it was just the lack of management. The accounts were more or less accurate,&#13;
&#13;
within the sort of accuracy that is required by the market. I mean, there was nothing&#13;
&#13;
grossly wrong. But Iâ&#128;&#153;ll give you a couple of examples.&#13;
&#13;
        Thereâ&#128;&#153;s a principle in accounting called "materiality." It means that you donâ&#128;&#153;t follow&#13;
&#13;
things to excessive detail if itâ&#128;&#153;s going to cost you a lot of work unless the result is going to&#13;
&#13;
be somehow material. "Material" meant, in the external auditorsâ&#128;&#153; eyes, something like five&#13;
&#13;
percent, an amount equal to about five percent of net income. If it made a difference of&#13;
&#13;
more than five percent in your net income, then it was something you ought to pay&#13;
&#13;
attention to and get right. If you did something that wasnâ&#128;&#153;t quite right and it was within&#13;
&#13;
that margin - and Iâ&#128;&#153;m not talking about loss of money, Iâ&#128;&#153;m talking about accounting&#13;
&#13;
handling - nobody really cared in the market, because whether you declared $995 million&#13;
&#13;
worth of income or a billion isnâ&#128;&#153;t going to alter anybodyâ&#128;&#153;s perception of whether the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
bonds are worth buying or not. Therefore, the auditors donâ&#128;&#153;t argue too much if they find&#13;
&#13;
minor mistakes. Well, when I came in I found that people would say: "Letâ&#128;&#153;s not bother to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               45&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 46&#13;
&#13;
get this right because it could never make more than $5 million difference even if we got it&#13;
&#13;
wrong." I insisted that they get it right. If we found an error post facto and it was less than&#13;
&#13;
five percent of net income, you donâ&#128;&#153;t have to go back and redo all accounts. You simply&#13;
&#13;
say there is no point in advertising this error because it doesnâ&#128;&#153;t make any difference. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
what materiality means. But it does not mean that we can get away with it because when&#13;
&#13;
the accountants find out weâ&#128;&#153;ve done something wrong, they will not ask us to correct it,&#13;
&#13;
and therefore you can freely make the error. This was just absolutely impossible, because&#13;
&#13;
among other things it would lead to conflicts between accounting policy and budget&#13;
&#13;
policy. Bob Picciotto might have wanted to handle certain matters in a particular way for&#13;
&#13;
purposes of the budget which would not be in line with accounting policy. Now, thereâ&#128;&#153;s no&#13;
&#13;
reason why the two should be the same. You do what you want for the budget totally&#13;
&#13;
independently of the accounts as long as you can be sure that the accounts just reflect what&#13;
&#13;
the accounts should reflect. But Bob Picciotto would say that when he quoted a figure on&#13;
&#13;
administrative costs, for example, he wanted it to be the same one that appears in the&#13;
&#13;
accounts, and therefore the accountants to act in the way he wanted things done in the&#13;
&#13;
budget. The accountants would simply tell him that their figures were accurate only to a&#13;
&#13;
margin of 5%. So I decided that the accounts had to be right, because all money has to be&#13;
&#13;
accounted for. If there are errors that we make because we do things wrong without&#13;
&#13;
intending to do things wrong than we have to decide how to deal with those errors. Now&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              46&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 47&#13;
&#13;
Bob Picciotto then had two choices, either he can conform to the accounts, or we have a&#13;
&#13;
difference between the budget and the accounts.&#13;
&#13;
       Now, making these decisions and defining a clear position had a tremendous effect&#13;
&#13;
on morale. The staff in Controllers had got into the state where they had lost all their&#13;
&#13;
battles, they had lost all their arguments and therefore experienced a diminution in&#13;
&#13;
professional respect. As a result, in the end of course they made some real mistakes.&#13;
&#13;
       When I started I went through the accounts and Iâ&#128;&#153;d come across some item&#13;
&#13;
"miscellaneous." I would ask: "What is that?" The staff would explain in broad terms, but&#13;
&#13;
didnâ&#128;&#153;t really seem to know. Then I would ask for a list of every single sub-account that&#13;
&#13;
made up in this big account. In this fashion I went through every account. I would find, for&#13;
&#13;
example, that there was an account 993. It would have some title in it and $5 million on the&#13;
&#13;
asset side or the liability side. I'd ask: "What's that?" And the people would look at me and&#13;
&#13;
reply: "We don't know. It's been there for a long time, but the files are lost and we don't&#13;
&#13;
know what that file was." So, I would tell them: "Well, I'm not having anything going into&#13;
&#13;
my accounts which I don't know what it is. You find it out or we write it off." I had them&#13;
&#13;
go through every one of the accounts like that and clean up the whole mess. Sometimes&#13;
&#13;
they found out what the items were, and they might have been simply a duplication of&#13;
&#13;
something else and should have been amalgamated long ago. We had accounts that nobody&#13;
&#13;
had ownership of. We had accounts where two people had the right to put money in and&#13;
&#13;
take money out so that nobody was held responsible. I said: "No way. I want one manager&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              47&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 48&#13;
&#13;
in charge of every account." Iâ&#128;&#153;d find suspense accounts, you know, where you put money&#13;
&#13;
you donâ&#128;&#153;t know what to do with.&#13;
&#13;
Some money would arrive in the cashierâ&#128;&#153;s division and you wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t know where to put it&#13;
&#13;
so youâ&#128;&#153;d put it in a suspense account while you figured out where the hell it belonged.&#13;
&#13;
Some of these accounts were quite large and some were four and five years old. But&#13;
&#13;
nobody was following up and the trail was completely dead.&#13;
&#13;
       There was no system for checking these things. I decided to institute certain rules,&#13;
&#13;
for instance, that a division chief could keep some money in a suspense account for a&#13;
&#13;
month. If he wanted to keep something in a suspense account because he couldnâ&#128;&#153;t figure&#13;
&#13;
out where the hell it belonged, he had to go and talk to his director about it because&#13;
&#13;
otherwise these things drag. If the director canâ&#128;&#153;t decide whether to write it off or send the&#13;
&#13;
money back, they would have to do further investigations and if the item exceeds a certain&#13;
&#13;
amount.&#13;
&#13;
       We had problems in the loan department. To give you an example. Suppose&#13;
&#13;
somebody misread something and sent a bill to Papua-New Guinea instead of to Paraguay,&#13;
&#13;
two countries which were close to each other in the alphabet. Now Papua-New Guinea just&#13;
&#13;
paid it, because nobody understands our bills. If youâ&#128;&#153;ve ever read a bill, I mean, youâ&#128;&#153;ve&#13;
&#13;
been Country Director but I donâ&#128;&#153;t think youâ&#128;&#153;ve ever read a bill, but if you had tried to read&#13;
&#13;
one of our bills, you would not have understood it. I couldnâ&#128;&#153;t understand them, and I&#13;
&#13;
couldnâ&#128;&#153;t explain them to anybody else. So Papua-New Guinea has paid this bill, and, of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              48&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 49&#13;
&#13;
course, eventually we find out that this wasnâ&#128;&#153;t quite right. Then we check back and we find&#13;
&#13;
out that we sent Papua-New Guinea the Paraguay bill, so we want to correct it and we want&#13;
&#13;
to send back some money. But we keep our accounts in dollars and their bill was in&#13;
&#13;
Deutsche Marks or Swiss francs or whatever it was, and now we have to pay them back the&#13;
&#13;
amount we owe them. But, of course, the exchange rates have changed in the meantime so&#13;
&#13;
there is now a $150,000 difference and the question is, what to do with it. Well, the rules&#13;
&#13;
were so lax that the loan accounting people would just write off that $150,000, and they&#13;
&#13;
wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t even tell their Director that theyâ&#128;&#153;d done it. They were hiding all their mistakes.&#13;
&#13;
So I had to lay down rules about very elementary things about what decisions division&#13;
&#13;
chiefs and directors could take and when they had to come to me before we would make a&#13;
&#13;
decision.      The relationships between the decentralized units and the centralized units&#13;
&#13;
were not well organized and controlled at all, so I set up a controls unit to see that each of&#13;
&#13;
the decentralized units were following the right sort of practices so that we could accept&#13;
&#13;
their figures for our accounts with some confidence and know that even though they were&#13;
&#13;
decentralized, we had a clear picture of the whole account. There were just masses and&#13;
&#13;
masses of issues that had to be sorted out because everything you touched had minor&#13;
&#13;
oddities and incongruities. You felt constantly that the whole system was about to crumble&#13;
&#13;
if you didnâ&#128;&#153;t reassert some sort of discipline and order.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     It was just that the system had run on autopilot over many years?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              49&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 50&#13;
&#13;
A:      Yeah. It was a matter of attitude and mind set regarding all the detail. A piece of&#13;
&#13;
paper would come in, some money would arrive for the Bank, sometimes from borrowers,&#13;
&#13;
sometimes from suppliers, sometimes just in plain error. Somebody might send us some&#13;
&#13;
money because they made a mistake at their end. Usually, of course, these are self-&#13;
&#13;
correcting mistakes because the people who sent the money by mistake realize it sooner or&#13;
&#13;
later and come after it. Something that happened to us just the other day. But itâ&#128;&#153;s very&#13;
&#13;
irritating if you have to find out what happened. You have to dig in the accounts and then&#13;
&#13;
put some money back which, if you had have a decent system on yourself, you wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
have accepted money which wasnâ&#128;&#153;t yours in the first place.&#13;
&#13;
        Of course, there are limits. We used to have great difficulties identifying payments.&#13;
&#13;
Weâ&#128;&#153;d get payments from some bank and weâ&#128;&#153;d find out that this came from Gabon and it&#13;
&#13;
was to pay some debt. But the Gabonese would never give the reference numbers and we&#13;
&#13;
would have problems recognizing the amount because they didnâ&#128;&#153;t pay us the exact amount&#13;
&#13;
and the payment did not tie up with our bills. Often you can recognize transactions and you&#13;
&#13;
can do a quick check. But sometimes it is very difficult to figure out what a payment is&#13;
&#13;
for. Then instead of going to the trouble of writing back to the bank and asking to trace the&#13;
&#13;
payment, it is much better to put it in a sort of suspense account and see whether anybody&#13;
&#13;
bitches about it.&#13;
&#13;
        So the job was a question of providing some management and changing the staff&#13;
&#13;
attitude. I found a lady who had been working on disbursing Madagascar loans for 17&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              50&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 51&#13;
&#13;
years. You donâ&#128;&#153;t do things like that because apart from the fact it must be terribly boring,&#13;
&#13;
you are inviting trouble. If you are going to get collusion with outsiders it comes because&#13;
&#13;
somebody has been doing the job for 17 years and thereâ&#128;&#153;s somebody at the other end who is&#13;
&#13;
looking for opportunities to cheat. It always takes two people to do something, and they&#13;
&#13;
take time to feel around before they feel confident that they can actually put something&#13;
&#13;
together to mess around. So one of the very elementary steps is to divide jobs up so that&#13;
&#13;
they donâ&#128;&#153;t have total controls over the process. You canâ&#128;&#153;t prevent collusion completely but&#13;
&#13;
if you have to have collusion of three people rather than two you have increased the&#13;
&#13;
chances of avoiding problems because nobody wants to make the first step. But another&#13;
&#13;
very important principle is that you donâ&#128;&#153;t leave people in charge of the same account for 17&#13;
&#13;
years.&#13;
&#13;
         There was no career development in the department. We stopped taking staff who&#13;
&#13;
were rejects from somewhere else. We did not hire people if they werenâ&#128;&#153;t up to what we&#13;
&#13;
wanted. We brought in better quality accountants and I took over the accounting for&#13;
&#13;
relations with borrowers. Now we are the intellectual home for the accountants in the&#13;
&#13;
Bank, and that is very important for the professional standards we want to establish.&#13;
&#13;
Q:       Did you find all this out by yourself? Did you have help or advice?&#13;
&#13;
A:       No. Just found it out by asking questions. Mike Ruddy was doing a lot of that, and,&#13;
&#13;
and I brought in Raghavan on the Loan department side, and they just addressed things in a&#13;
&#13;
different spirit. Now, did I find out everything myself? No. I found an awful lot, but&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              51&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 52&#13;
&#13;
Mike Ruddy and I shared briefings when we came in and we were all learning these things&#13;
&#13;
together. The nice thing about having Mike there was that we would agree on what needed&#13;
&#13;
to be done and he would know how to fix it.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Did you have any interaction with Conable about your work at that point? Did he&#13;
&#13;
have any interest in what you were doing?&#13;
&#13;
A:     None at all. Absolutely none at all. And I had very little contact with him.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Now, this changed when Preston came on board?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Yeah. Preston came in September 91. So Iâ&#128;&#153;d been there about a year and a half.&#13;
&#13;
The first contact I had with him was being called upstairs to have a chat with him. He had&#13;
&#13;
two things he wanted to talk to me about, heâ&#128;&#153;d been here about a month. First, he wanted&#13;
&#13;
to know my views on the managing director arrangement which heâ&#128;&#153;d just announced. I told&#13;
&#13;
him that he was well advised to get rid of the Senior Vice Presidents because of the history&#13;
&#13;
of their relationship. I said that I would not have thought of the Managing Director&#13;
&#13;
approach because it was not within my experience to do that. But I assured him that he had&#13;
&#13;
to do something, and the only alternative would have been to bang the heads together of&#13;
&#13;
the Senior Vice Presidents and make certain they do what he wanted them to do. But I also&#13;
&#13;
told him that I thought that in the long-term the arrangement would not work because he&#13;
&#13;
had divided up the Finance Complex in too many ways and there was no senior finance&#13;
&#13;
officer. In fact, this is just now happening; they are forming a new finance policy&#13;
&#13;
committee because Wolfensohn feels the lack of a senior person in charge of finance is a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              52&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 53&#13;
&#13;
bit awkward. Likewise, I suggested that he needed to have a senior vice president on the&#13;
&#13;
operational side in charge of policy making and coordination. I told him there was no need&#13;
&#13;
for massive front offices but that there was need to bring things together at the senior&#13;
&#13;
management level. I said that shifting to the Managing Director approach might be a good&#13;
&#13;
way to break away from the existing system with all its shortcomings, but if the Managing&#13;
&#13;
Director approach began fail, I urged him, he should get back to having senior vice&#13;
&#13;
presidents again whom he would pick and manage. But he liked the Managing Director&#13;
&#13;
approach anyway and I donâ&#128;&#153;t think he really paid much attention to what I told him. But in&#13;
&#13;
fact I just wonder whether it will survive in that way.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Yeah. I would doubt that also, it has never really worked well.&#13;
&#13;
A:     Never. The Managing Directors happen to work well together but there was no&#13;
&#13;
leadership of any sort. That was my view that I expressed when he first announced it, and I&#13;
&#13;
tackled him about that again when Ernie announced his retirement. I also talked to Ernie&#13;
&#13;
about this when he did my own evaluation, and Preston talked to me with Ernie about it.&#13;
&#13;
He would ask: "Well, we know about you, but what do you think about us?" And I would&#13;
&#13;
always come back to the fact that I interact happily with everybody, especially with Ernie,&#13;
&#13;
and I had no problems to complain about, but I pointed out that a CFO was lacking and&#13;
&#13;
that one of these days something will fall between the cracks, like the building, and he&#13;
&#13;
would not find anybody in charge of it, or whoever he would decide was responsible will&#13;
&#13;
have many reasons to deny his responsibility. The idea of separating financial policy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              53&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 54&#13;
&#13;
making from the treasury operation and from the controllerâ&#128;&#153;s operation only makes sense if&#13;
&#13;
you have a CFO. In the absence of a CFO he, Preston, was the CFO. If anything went&#13;
&#13;
wrong, he would be responsible for this. Yet, he had no time to follow everything. I also&#13;
&#13;
spoke with Richard Frank when he took over in the end. I asked Preston when Richard&#13;
&#13;
was appointed, whether he was going to be a CFO. And Lew just looked at me and he said:&#13;
&#13;
"Oh, my God! I forgot to think about that. Let me go away and think about that." So went&#13;
&#13;
away and thought about it and then came back and said he thought heâ&#128;&#153;d keep things the&#13;
&#13;
way they were. And then Richard objected, he couldnâ&#128;&#153;t object to not being CFO but he did&#13;
&#13;
insist - I spent a long time with Richard on this - he did insist that there be a new financial&#13;
&#13;
policy committee which he would chair. It really is necessary to do that, but itâ&#128;&#153;s not the&#13;
&#13;
most efficient way, there ought to be somebody in the Bank whose job it is to think of the&#13;
&#13;
wide range of financial issues together and make decisions in that context.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Now, one of the things that happened when Preston came in was of course that the&#13;
&#13;
budget became part of the Controllers department.&#13;
&#13;
A:     Right. That was the second thing he asked me. He asked me to take over the&#13;
&#13;
budget and the internal audit because he felt that these were essential parts of the modern&#13;
&#13;
controllership, the budget was a means of controlling events, the same as accounting. I said&#13;
&#13;
that was fine. But then I asked him: "Did you know that the last time I was offered the&#13;
&#13;
Director of the Budget job it led to an awful lot of commotion and I nearly left the Bank&#13;
&#13;
because I didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to do it?" He said Ernie hadnâ&#128;&#153;t told him that and he would have a few&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              54&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 55&#13;
&#13;
words with Ernie because Ernie was supposed to keep him informed of what's relevant and&#13;
&#13;
what's not relevant. But I said that the budget was in such a mess and there were so many&#13;
&#13;
complaints about it that I was prepared to help since he seemed to be putting it fairly high&#13;
&#13;
on his agenda of things that needed to be sorted out. I didn't actually take over the budget&#13;
&#13;
for seven months because I said I was not prepared to take responsibility for the budget&#13;
&#13;
that was then being put together. But during that seven months period I designed a new&#13;
&#13;
budget system.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     This was part of the deal that you would redesign the budget process? Or was the&#13;
&#13;
original decision that the budget system needed to be changed?&#13;
&#13;
A:     That's right. Well, in Preston 's mind there was a decision that there needed to be&#13;
&#13;
changes in the budget system, yes. But what they would be was left to us to decide. So I&#13;
                                                                                                RESTRICTED&#13;
was working during that period with Bob and the Budget staff and on a number of                WBO ARCHIVES&#13;
&#13;
occasions we nearly came to                                                                    MAR 1 b 2011&#13;
                                                                                                  f)&#13;
&#13;
                         So that was a very dodgy period. And, of course, the staff were in&#13;
&#13;
a real quandary because there they were reporting to Bob Picciotto and it was very difficult&#13;
&#13;
for them to agree with me that they ought to make changes. But we could not wait and do&#13;
&#13;
nothing until Picciotto was ready to leave. So it was just very, very awkward.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Did Ernie have a fairly strong hand in this exercise?&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                             55&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 56&#13;
&#13;
A:     Ernie was put at that stage expressly in charge of the budget. But he left it to Bob&#13;
&#13;
and me to work out the details. It was just as awkward for him as it was for Preston and&#13;
&#13;
everybody else. If you get somebody who is being defensive about things and heâ&#128;&#153;s still&#13;
&#13;
technically in charge and all of the staff report to him, what is Ernie to do? I had no wish&#13;
&#13;
whatsoever to take over that last budget, which I didnâ&#128;&#153;t want to take responsibility for.&#13;
&#13;
Among other things it provided for this huge increase in ECA which was partially justified&#13;
&#13;
and partially not.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     And turned out to haunt us.&#13;
&#13;
A:     Yes. Thatâ&#128;&#153;s right. So, that was a very awkward period, but we did manage to find a&#13;
&#13;
way of introducing the dollar budgeting which Bob tried before but failed to do. It wasnâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
as though he was against the idea of dollar budgeting. In fact, he was very pro dollar&#13;
&#13;
budgeting. The reason why he hadnâ&#128;&#153;t done it was that he had allowed himself to get&#13;
&#13;
swamped by the detail of it. Every time anybody had made an objection to him on any&#13;
&#13;
ground, he had tried to find an answer, and there were many questions for which there was&#13;
&#13;
no answer, or the answer was worse than the problem. Bob was trying to figure out a way&#13;
&#13;
around all the problems that surfaced and with all the rules becoming more complicated all&#13;
&#13;
the time the system became totally unworkable. My attitude was very different. I thought&#13;
&#13;
that most these problems were mythical but there was one that was real as far as I knew. If&#13;
&#13;
you are an Australian with children your benefits cost you a lot more than if you are a&#13;
&#13;
single person whoâ&#128;&#153;s a U.S. permanent resident who it will cost you nothing in the way of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              56&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 57&#13;
&#13;
benefits. Therefore when you move to a dollar budget basis you have to even that out&#13;
&#13;
because the discrepancies are so large. That we did. As for all the other expected&#13;
&#13;
problems, weâ&#128;&#153;ll watch and the moment we see a problem weâ&#128;&#153;ll think of a solution. But&#13;
&#13;
until the problem actually shows itself we will not worry about it. And we were watching&#13;
&#13;
for the problems to arise and they havenâ&#128;&#153;t arisen yet. So we havenâ&#128;&#153;t had any problems&#13;
&#13;
there. It was just a matter of acting, otherwise we would never have moved to dollar&#13;
&#13;
budgeting.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     This new system works obviously easier and is less painful to administer. Has it&#13;
&#13;
also saved some money?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Well, thatâ&#128;&#153;s difficult to say because saving money is not necessarily the objective.&#13;
&#13;
People can spend their money on other things, so you can get more output and you donâ&#128;&#153;t&#13;
&#13;
save money unless you intend to save money. But dollar budgeting itself is more efficient&#13;
&#13;
because I think that the system gives people the freedom to spend the money as they wish.&#13;
&#13;
They may make a mess of it by choosing the wrong things, but in theory if you give them&#13;
&#13;
the freedom to balance consultants and staff at the proper pricing and between that and all&#13;
&#13;
other types of expenditures, a good manager will get more out of his money than he will if&#13;
&#13;
heâ&#128;&#153;s got a rigid allocation of various resources. So in that sense I think the answer is, yes&#13;
&#13;
the new system should save some money.&#13;
&#13;
       Where it has been disappointing, though, is in two respects. One, which is very&#13;
&#13;
key, is that youâ&#128;&#153;ve got to have a manager who is prepared to spend some time in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              57&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 58&#13;
&#13;
determining how he is going to use the freedom he has to try and optimize in some way&#13;
&#13;
what he gets out of that money. If I suddenly give you a dollar budget and tell you here is&#13;
&#13;
your $5 million, itâ&#128;&#153;s exactly what you had before but you can use it any way you want, and&#13;
&#13;
you simply decide to carry on doing business as usual, obviously it doesnâ&#128;&#153;t save any&#13;
&#13;
money. So thatâ&#128;&#153;s, there you need a different attitude. Youâ&#128;&#153;ve provided the water trough and&#13;
&#13;
youâ&#128;&#153;ve got the horse but the drinking is the same problem which is the one I referred to&#13;
&#13;
earlier when I said weâ&#128;&#153;ve got too many economists and the way weâ&#128;&#153;ve organized ourselves&#13;
&#13;
is such that thereâ&#128;&#153;s no real incentive for most of the managers to take advantage of what&#13;
&#13;
you give them to improve things. So you need some additional incentive which you either&#13;
&#13;
get by making certain youâ&#128;&#153;ve got managers there who actually take some pride in doing&#13;
&#13;
things efficiently, which is the best way, in my view, or you second-guess them every&#13;
&#13;
minute of the day on what their decisions are, which is totally unacceptable to me because&#13;
&#13;
the central budget people cannot possibly know whatâ&#128;&#153;s going on every day. Neither should&#13;
&#13;
they. So if you will not change the managers so that they are effective, I will come up with&#13;
&#13;
some very broad-brush ideas of where I think there is savings to be made, and I will just&#13;
&#13;
appropriate those savings. This will force the managers to take them. And thatâ&#128;&#153;s what I did&#13;
&#13;
in the end. Very crude, but effective.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Is that the origin of the six percent cut?&#13;
&#13;
A:     Absolutely. It was just utter frustration, knowing that there was waste and that the&#13;
&#13;
managers were not paying any attention to management per se. Therefore whatever I did&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              58&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 59&#13;
&#13;
was not going to lead to any more efficiency because most of these people, not all, there&#13;
&#13;
were the honorable exceptions, were not going to put in the time to do established their&#13;
&#13;
priorities. So I made them put in a bit of time to do it, both in the interest of selectivity and&#13;
&#13;
in the interest of actual efficiency. Since we announced, that there was going to be a cut of&#13;
&#13;
the budget more thinking actually took place in the few months after that than, as far as I&#13;
&#13;
could see, had taken place in donkeyâ&#128;&#153;s years before that. And it has to be persisted with&#13;
&#13;
and thatâ&#128;&#153;s one of the reasons why we did the cut over two years, If you did it for one year&#13;
&#13;
only people would think they would somehow get over this year and then nothing would&#13;
&#13;
have changed. I myself recommended five percent indefinitely to Preston, and I had in fact&#13;
&#13;
put it in terms of five to six percent, on the grounds that he better ask for six. Since it was&#13;
&#13;
being done so crudely we probably would give away some so by the time we are finished&#13;
&#13;
we are probably closer to five than to six percent. But I went up to Preston and suggested&#13;
&#13;
that we cut five to six percent indefinitely. I expected that as we get into this more we will&#13;
&#13;
get sharper and sharper focused because we will be able to see and do more analysis. We&#13;
&#13;
will recognize where to stop because we are really eating into the fat in some units whereas&#13;
&#13;
in others we should continue to cut because there is nothing but fat. Of course, I had some&#13;
&#13;
ideas about which ones they were.&#13;
&#13;
        Preston did two things. First of all, he decided that he wanted to cut six percent&#13;
&#13;
which meant that I had to translate that into six to seven to try and get the six percent he&#13;
&#13;
wanted. Secondly, he wanted to cut over two successive years. The reason was that he&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               59&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                    Eccles, 4/25/95, Page 60&#13;
&#13;
wanted to complete the process before he would be handing over to somebody else and he&#13;
&#13;
did not want to commit his successor to continuing something which he may not want to&#13;
&#13;
do. Now it turns out, interestingly, that Mr. Wolfensohn does not have to think about the&#13;
&#13;
budget in the first few months of his arrival because thatâ&#128;&#153;s not where the pressure is. He is&#13;
&#13;
not under pressure to cut the budget any more, because it is being done already. That&#13;
&#13;
means heâ&#128;&#153;s got time to think about where he wants the Bank to be, whether he wants the&#13;
&#13;
Bank to be leaner still, which I think would be correct, but, of course, he may want to lead&#13;
&#13;
the Bank do more with the available resources. It is conceivable that we are cutting out&#13;
&#13;
waste and reducing the budget while at the same time increasing by adding more resources&#13;
&#13;
to do substantive work. In this case you balance one off against the other and you may end&#13;
&#13;
up either with a much lower decline of the budget, or you may actually turn around and&#13;
&#13;
start growing again in net terms, but you grow by hiring people that you think are&#13;
&#13;
appropriate to do the tasks that you want to do and with much tighter control over spending&#13;
&#13;
than we have at the moment.&#13;
&#13;
Q:     Thank you very much, Stephen, this has been a very full and rich interview. It has&#13;
&#13;
been a pleasure to talk to you.&#13;
&#13;
A:     Thank you.&#13;

            Transcript of oral history interview with
            Stephen D. Eccles held on April 5, 11, 18 and 25, 1995

        <abstracts>
            On April 5, 11, 18, and 25, 1995,
            Stephen D. Eccles was interviewed on behalf of the World
            Bank Group Archives oral history program by Jochen Kraske.
            During his tenure at the Bank from 1966 to 1994, Mr. Eccles
            worked in the following areas: as a young professional
            (1966-1967); in the agriculture projects department as a
            project officer (1967-1970), as assistant to the director
            (1971), and as deputy chief to the agro-industrial division;
            in the Europe, Middle East and North Africa (EMENA) region
            as program coordinator (1972-1974); in the program and
            budgeting department as financial advisor (1975-1976); in
            the eastern Africa region as chief of the East and South
            Africa agriculture division (1977-1982); in the western
            Africa region as assistant director for the projects
            department (1982-1987); in financial operations as deputy
            treasurer and director (1987-1990); and as vice president
            and controller (1990-1994). Although Mr. Eccles specialized
            in country economics, he knew a lot about project economic
            analysis. His transcript concerns his work on the loan
            portfolio review, an extensive review of an agriculture
            project in Tanzania, and the reorganization of the World
            Bank in 1987.
