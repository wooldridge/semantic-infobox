1. VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION IN CHINA&#13;
A. ECONOMIC GROWTH IN CHINA AND LABOR DEMAND&#13;
1.1   China's transition from central planning to markets is taking place against a&#13;
background of extraordinarily fast economic growth. Over the 1986-94 period, real&#13;
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) increased at an annual average rate of almost 10 percent.&#13;
Currently, with double-digit growth again in 1995, China is the fastest growing economy&#13;
in Asia, the world's fastest growing region. Growth is particularly rapid in the industry&#13;
and services sectors. Industry accounted for 47 percent of GDP in 1994, compared with&#13;
42 percent in 1990, and over the same period the share of the services sector rose from 31&#13;
to 32 percent.&#13;
1.2   Within industry, there is a shift towards internationally competitive, higher-&#13;
quality and more technologically advanced products, reflecting increased exposure to&#13;
international markets. Total merchandise export earnings were $121 billion in 1994,&#13;
double their level of only three years earlier. The product and market structure of exports&#13;
has been transformed. Manufactured goods accounted for 84 percent of merchandise&#13;
export earnings in 1994, compared with 49 percent nine years earlier. About 30 percent&#13;
of export earnings now comes from light industry: exports of electronics products alone&#13;
were worth $8 billion in 1993, 18 percent more than a year earlier, and electronics&#13;
accounted for over 5 percent of the value of industrial output.&#13;
1.3    Within the services sector, high-technology branches are growing particularly&#13;
fast: in 1993, for example, the number of enterprises offering scientific, research and&#13;
technological services was 85 percent higher than a year earlier.&#13;
1.4   A significant factor in the increased competitiveness of the economy has been the&#13;
sharp rise in foreign direct investment inflows, principally to the manufacturing and real&#13;
estate sectors. Gross foreign direct irwestment inflows grew from virtually nothing in&#13;
1980 to $34 billion in 1994, and now account for almost half of all such flows to&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
1.5   Growth and structural change in the economy are reflected in the pattern of labor&#13;
use. The share of the service sector in total employment rose from 18 to 23 percent&#13;
between 1989 and 1994 while that of industry rose from 22 to 23 percent. During the&#13;
same period, agriculture's share in employment fell from 60 to 54 percent. Compared&#13;
with other advanced developing countries, China still has an unusually large proportion&#13;
of its workforce in the agricultural sector, but the structure is changing rapidly.&#13;
1.6   The open unemployment rate is very small, reportedly only 2.6 percent in urban&#13;
areas, and in the faster-growing regions, enterprises report shortages of labor, particularly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
skilled labor. Real average wages rose at an annual average rate of almost 7 percent&#13;
between 1989 and 1994. However, state enterprises still contain large reserves of surplus&#13;
labor and productivity is low. Moreover, productivity increases in agriculture have&#13;
rendered a large number of rural workers redundant.&#13;
B. IMPLICATIONS FOR VOCATIONAL TRAINING&#13;
1.7   The rapid growth and structural change of China's economy, coupled with reform&#13;
of its State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), are placing major new demands on the skills and&#13;
capabilities of its labor force and, hence, on the country's educational and training&#13;
system. Chinese industrial and manufacturing outputs are increasingly geared to the&#13;
export market, requiring higher quality and more technologically advanced products. The&#13;
previously underdeveloped services sector, now expanding with particular speed,&#13;
includes an increasing number of enterprises offering scientific, research and&#13;
technological services. All this has created significant demand for well-trained technical&#13;
staff, who have acquired their skills through preservice and inservice training. In 1993,&#13;
an estimated one in 15 industrial workers was recruited during the past year; in the&#13;
services sector, the ratio was probably one in ten. Inplant training alone is insufficient to&#13;
cope with new recruits on this scale. At the same time, the industrial restructuring&#13;
accompanying SOE reform, with the aim of creating more efficient and competitive&#13;
enterprises, has major implications for worker training. As SOEs commercialize by, inter&#13;
alia, shedding the 15 percent of their labor force (some 17 million people) that are&#13;
redundant and demanding higher skills of the staff who remain, workers will need&#13;
retraining to improve or acquire skills sought by the emerging market economy.&#13;
Development of China's labor market, structural change in the economy, and reform of&#13;
its uncompetitive and loss-making SOEs are therefore partly dependent on having an&#13;
efficient, market-responsive skills training system.&#13;
C. CHINA'S SYSTEM OF VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION&#13;
1.8    As shown in Table 1.1, about half of all senior secondary school students attend&#13;
vocational and technical (VTE) schools, making this a highly important part of China's&#13;
educational system. The prominence given to VTE results from educational system&#13;
reforms first articulated in 1985 and iriiroduced in 1987. These reforms were aimed at&#13;
equipping about half of all secondary school graduates with practical job skills, and the&#13;
remaining half, who attend general secondary schools, for general employment and for&#13;
further education. In addition to enrollments in full-time courses of two, three and four&#13;
years' duration, the VTE secondary schools have substantial enrollment in short courses&#13;
for inservice training and for specialist preemployment training.&#13;

Source: China: Education Statistical Yearbook 1995.&#13;
1.9   VTE is provided by both the State Education Commission (SEdC), in charge of&#13;
Secondary Technical and Vocational Schools (STSs and SVSs) that provide mainly&#13;
preservice training, and the Ministry of Labor (MOL), which oversees Skilled Workers&#13;
Schools (SWS), providing training at secondary level. The STSs are largely engineering&#13;
trade schools responsible to the relevant technical bureaus. A decreasing portion, now&#13;
about 60 percent of their graduates, are assigned to jobs by the local government; the&#13;
balance find employment on their own. The SVSs are for the most part managed and&#13;
financed by local education bureaus. SVS graduates find their own employment in the&#13;
emerging labor market. Finally, SWSs are managed by local labor bureaus, technical&#13;
bureaus and enterprises. The recently approved Bank Group supported Labor Market&#13;
Development Project (Ln. 3967/Cr. 2800-CHA) focuses partially on inservice training;&#13;
more detailed information on that segment of the VTE system is provided in the related&#13;
Staff Appraisal Report (No. 14602-CHA).   The proposed project supports a&#13;
complementary effort for SEdC schools.&#13;
1.10  Links with employers are strong, particularly for STSs and SWSs because of their&#13;
cooperation with technical bureaus and SOEs. The labor market is only now emerging,&#13;
and, although the central assignment of graduates from STSs and SWSs to jobs in SOEs&#13;
is being abolished, students who are sponsored by SOEs and local governments are&#13;
committed to employment under terms of agreements that are often between the school&#13;
and the enterprise or local government. It is reported, however, that opportunities for&#13;
graduates to choose their employers are increasing. There are also high proportions of&#13;
fee-paying students in STSs and SVSs who are not committed to any employer.&#13;
Employment of VTE graduates in the rapidly developing, particularly coastal, provinces&#13;
is high, with the schools unable to satisfy the demand of employers for the numbers of&#13;
new employees required.&#13;
1.11   Since 1980, there has been a dramatic increase in the volume and proportion of&#13;
VTE students. Enrollments in STSs increased from 1.24 million in 1980 to 3.2 million in&#13;
1994, an average annual increase of about 10 percent. SWS enrollments went from 0.7&#13;
million to 1.87 million, increasing again at about 10 percent a year, and SVSs grew from&#13;
0.45 million in 1980 to 4.06 million in 1994, expanding at some 17 percent annually.&#13;
From 1980 to 1994, the enrollment in general senior secondary schools dropped by 2.3&#13;
percent a year from about 9.7 million to 6.65 million, due to the conversion of general&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
secondary schools into vocational schools. In terms of growth, the SVSs are clearly the&#13;
most dynamic type of schools, reflecting the local government's responsibility for their&#13;
development and freedom from the constraint on STSs and SWSs of admitting assigned&#13;
students for guaranteed employment.&#13;
1.12  The reorientation of vocational education enrollment to the service sectors may&#13;
accurately reflect employment needs, but also the low capital cost of mounting&#13;
nontechnical courses. While surveys of selected areas indicate that graduates of SVS&#13;
programs have found employment in new, emerging enterprises, an effective system is&#13;
needed to monitor labor market trends to ensure that enrollments are adjusted to demand.&#13;
With an estimated net annual growth rate of employment of 2 percent in China, total&#13;
employment of 615 million in 1994, and a net annual increase of 12 million jobs, the 2&#13;
million VTE graduates annually represent a relatively large proportion (17 percent) of&#13;
new job applicants. Hence, a slowdown in economic and employment growth could lead&#13;
to a mism.atch of skills and unemployment among graduates. An improved labor market&#13;
information system will be tested under the Labor Market Development Project, and&#13;
school-level systems for this purpose would be introduced under the proposed project.&#13;
1.13  Private higher and secondary-level VTE has been officially encouraged since&#13;
1993. Based on information provided in a 1994 SEdC report, about 2.5 percent of SVS&#13;
enrollment was in private institutions, mainly in urban areas.&#13;
1.14  Gender differentiation does not appear to be a serious issue in VTE. Both SEdC&#13;
and MOL guidelines specify that males and females be recruited and enrolled on equal&#13;
terms, on merit, and without fixed ratios. Data indicate that females comprise close to 50&#13;
percent of total enrollments in STSs and SVSs. The female graduates would not be&#13;
expected to encounter gender-based discrimination in hiring since Chinese society&#13;
encourages women to participate equally with men in all employment fields.&#13;
Regulatory Framework for Vocational Education&#13;
1.15  Overall policy and strategy for VTE is set by the SEdC, while the main&#13;
responsibility for management of the system rests with the provincial, county/city and&#13;
district level governments. SEdC employs a number of tools to implement policy,&#13;
including: (a) the setting of broad targets, such as the proportion of senior secondary&#13;
students to be enrolled in VTE; (b) provision of standards for staffing, including numbers,&#13;
qualifications and experience; (c) preparation and publication of guidelines for curricula&#13;
for the main subjects, standard lists of practical exercises to be performed and lists of&#13;
equipment to be provided in each specialization; and, most notably, (d) targets for the&#13;
establishment of key schools at local, provincial and national levels, with criteria to be&#13;
met for the adequacy and quality of facilities, staffing numbers and qualifications, etc.&#13;
Provincial and local governments and the schools appear to give very high status to&#13;
recognition of a school as a key school, particularly at the national level. This encourages&#13;
investment and development to meet the criteria. SEdC provides only limited funding;&#13;
however, it does control indirect funding from international bodies like the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
The proposed project would support development of 82 local-level key schools, with the&#13;
aim of their becoming provincial or national key schools.&#13;
1.16  SEdC controls the development of vocational education through issuance of&#13;
regulations and guidelines. A vocational education law is expected to be enacted in 1996,&#13;
which would be expected to establish the framework for a comprehensive vocational&#13;
education system, embracing: clear responsibilities for funding; encouragement to&#13;
enterprises to give more attention to training; raising quality of VTE; establishing a&#13;
national system of occupational classification and skills standards; and improving&#13;
schools' linkages with government departments and enterprises. The law would be&#13;
expected to also include penalties for violation.&#13;
1.17  Assessment and certification of trainees' competencies is currently carried out&#13;
through a system of double qualification, combining a trades skills test administered by&#13;
MOL and a technical certificate awarded by a vocational school on the basis of a school&#13;
examination. The National Vocational Skills Testing and Guidance Center is being&#13;
strengthened and skills testing centers are being established in selected municipalities&#13;
under the Labor Market Development Project.&#13;
System Financing and Costs&#13;
1.18  VTE schools have various sources of financing. While capital costs are normally&#13;
provided by local governments, a survey of schools to be included in the proposed&#13;
project, representing institutions that already have fairly high standards, indicates that the&#13;
schoois obtain an average of about 53 percent of their current funding from government&#13;
through a variety of agencies, almost entirely provincial and subprovincial, 14 percent&#13;
from enterprises, 24 percent from tuition fees, and 9 percent from their own production&#13;
activities (Annex2). SVSs, which obtain only 48 percent of their current finance from&#13;
government, get 28 percent from tuition fees, while STSs are more reliant on government&#13;
funding (59 percent) but also attract a higher proportion from enterprises (17 percent).&#13;
Cost recovery for nonacademic specializations is high.&#13;
1.19  The same survey gathered data on school costs. Unit recurrent costs for 1993/94&#13;
averaged Y 2,540 per year per student for-STSs, Y 1,590 for SVS, and Y 1,574 for SWSs.&#13;
Capital expenditures in 1993/94 averaged about Y 2,100 per student. Most of this&#13;
investment was for buildings. The average expenditure on equipment was only about&#13;
Y 300 per student. Since appropriate equipment is crucial to better quality and expanded&#13;
areas of technical training, equipment comprises a large part of the proposed project's&#13;
inputs, and it is estimated that the project investment for equipment would amount to an&#13;
average of Y 1I.100 per student per year for project schools.&#13;
System Strengths and Weaknesses&#13;
1.20  Strengths. The current VTE system has strengths and weaknesses. On the&#13;
positive side, its external efficiency appears high compared to the situation in most&#13;
developing countries.  Almost two thirds of schools obtain regular advice from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
employers, usually through their membership in school management and/or advisory&#13;
committees, and links with non-SOEs are increasing. In the proposed project provinces,&#13;
graduates obtain employment immediately after graduation, and employers, who sponsor&#13;
a substantial proportion of students, report a demand for more graduates than they are&#13;
able to obtain. A tracer study carried out in 1993, as part of project preparation, found&#13;
that the proportion of graduates (three cohorts out of school for a year or more) who had&#13;
been promoted or changed jobs was unusually high, and that earnings compared&#13;
favorably with national averages.&#13;
1.21   The availability of school-based employment information is also better than in&#13;
many countries. Secondary VTE schools in China regularly collect a great deal of&#13;
information about their graduates. Questionnaires are either sent to enterprises, and filled&#13;
in by the graduates/employees themselves and/or by their supervisors, or adrministered by&#13;
interview.  Qucstions cover employers' assessments of the skills and attitudes of&#13;
graduates and advice to the school, graduates' assessments of the relevance of their&#13;
training, and the extent to which they are working in the occupations for which they have&#13;
been trained. Response rates are very high, between 95 and 100 percent. The results are&#13;
taken seriously by the schools in deciding on changes in courses, curricula and syllabi.&#13;
This current practice is an excellent basis for the expansion and further development of a&#13;
school-based labor market information system adapted to a reforned labor market in&#13;
which graduates find jobs through other means than government allocation.&#13;
1.22   Weaknesses. While external efficiency is good, internal efficiency of the VTE&#13;
system is far less satisfactory. Improvements are needed in the qualifications of teaching&#13;
staff and school managers, training programs and instructional methods, and physical&#13;
facilities (buildings and equipment for laboratories and workshops). Adequate utilization&#13;
of staff and physical resources is impeded by low school enrollments, too few part-time&#13;
and short courses, and low teaching hours per week. In addition, links between schools&#13;
and prospective employers should be further strengthened, with the aim not only of&#13;
making training programs responsive to market signals but also to attract more financing&#13;
of training equipment and other inputs needed for more technically sophisticated training&#13;
geared to emerging industrial needs. With respect to teaching staff, the majoritv lacks&#13;
industrial experience and also relevant technical skills. In many cases, teaching methods,&#13;
particularly in terms of practical applications, are outmoded and in urgent need of&#13;
upgrading. Teacher recruitment does not seem to present a problem, indicating that&#13;
teachers' salaries and working conditions are competitive.&#13;
1.23   Government policy calls for the introduction of competency-based and modular&#13;
programs. However, this has not been fully implemented, and established courses need to&#13;
be substantially updated to suit the needs of modern industry.&#13;
1.24  Instructor training at Technical Teacher Training Colleges (TTCs) and&#13;
Technical Teacher Training Departments (TTDs) of universities also needs upgrading.&#13;
Training programs are typically for four years, and entrance to the schools requires&#13;
completion of senior secondary school. Although past recruitment to the programs was&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
almost exclusively from academic schools, Government policy now requires an&#13;
increasing portion of the new recruits to have secondary technical school qualification.&#13;
However, curricula are theory-oriented and do not sufficiently emphasize practical topics&#13;
and the integration between theory and practice. Nor do they include the necessary&#13;
elements of teaching practice and industrial practice in support of other subjects. Trainers&#13;
also have been recruited based on academic merit rather than industrial experience,&#13;
practical skills and technical teaching experience.  As regards inservice instructor&#13;
training, some programs are offered at the TTCs and TTDs, but only a few of the key&#13;
schools get involved in these activities. As many schools have the necessary equipment&#13;
and sometimes potential trainers, it would be advisable to offer pedagogical and practical&#13;
skills programs at this level to enhance the teaching skills of the large majority of less&#13;
qualified instructors.&#13;
1.25  Improved integration of SEdC and MOL is needed at the central level and to a&#13;
lesser extent at the provincial and municipal levels. In the long term, when the labor&#13;
market has developed and needs have stabilized, some rationalization of the SEdC and&#13;
MOL VTE systems would be advisable. However, at this stage in China's development&#13;
process, the urgent need for better preservice training to meet the demand for technical&#13;
and service sector staff, as well as stepped up inservice training to accompany enterprise&#13;
reform make it advisable to retain and improve the capacities of both systems to serve&#13;
their particular segments of the VTE sector, albeit with an enhanced dialog on major&#13;
policy issues.&#13;
Government Policy for Vocational Education&#13;
1.26 The Government's goals for VTE include the reform of the system to&#13;
accommodate the needs of structural reform and development of the labor market, to&#13;
respond to the needs for both inservice and preemployment VTE, and to serve the tertiary&#13;
sector and private enterprise. In line with these goals, SEdC's policy for reform&#13;
addresses the key sectoral issues discussed earlier. Having achieved a balance between&#13;
general and vocational education, SEdC is now pursuing the following reforms:&#13;
(a) continued decentralization of school management to the local authorities and to the&#13;
schools to encourage a flexible response to changing demand for training, and&#13;
encouragement of greater participatioirof enterprises in the operations of the schools,&#13;
including increasing their contribution to the financing of training; (b) establishment of&#13;
flexible training programs and school-run admission policies to meet employment needs;&#13;
(c) abolition of the job assignment system, replacing it with an effective job placement&#13;
system for school graduates; (d) establishment of a network of relatively large, efficient,&#13;
broad-based key or model schools, based on the combination or replacement of groups of&#13;
existing small specialist schools; and (e) upgrading of the quality of the model schools,&#13;
and ultimately the system, by providing adequate equipment and a better teaching staff&#13;
Implementation of reform also translates into a need for curriculum development to&#13;
ensure that training programs meet the skill needs of industry, and improved instructor&#13;
training so that VTE teachers are better equipped in terms of their industrial experience,&#13;
up-to-date subject matter knowledge and relevant pedagogical skills. Through continued&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
decentralization of responsibility, school principals and managers will be in a better&#13;
position to utilize available resources efficiently and to strengthen linkages with&#13;
employers so that programs meeting immediate demands for skills are prioritized.&#13;
1.27  These reforms appear to be well under way, as indicated by the results of surveys&#13;
and tracer studies of selected schools in Beijing and the Provinces of Jiangsu, Hebei and&#13;
Shandong for the period 1987/8-1992/3. The progress of reform is indicated by improved&#13;
training delivery systems, formation of large schools from clusters of small schools to&#13;
realize economies of scale, and increased decentralization of management&#13;
responsibilities, linkages with industry, and cost recovery through tuition fees and&#13;
enterprise contracts. In some schools, as many as a third of 1992 graduates were&#13;
sponsored by enterprises, and most graduates found jobs by means other than allocation.&#13;
The proportion obtaining lifetime employment has dwindled (to 16 percent of graduates&#13;
included in the tracer studies), and contracts are now the predominant hiring arrangement,&#13;
particularly  for SVS  graduates.   The proportion  finding jobs in government&#13;
administration and state enterprises was still high (69 percent) but falling; however,&#13;
considering the vastly increased number of joint ventures since the time of this study, the&#13;
number of graduates employed in nongovemment enterprises is now very likely much&#13;
higher. This success notwithstanding, the scope of the VTE system, the rapidly&#13;
expanding demand for skilled labor, and the rapid transformation in training needs&#13;
require continuing reform initiatives.&#13;
D. BANK GROUP EXPERIENCE WITH VTE AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
1.28   Worldwide experience of vocational education and training in developing&#13;
countries was extensively studied and evaluated during the preparation of the Bank's&#13;
Policy Paper on Training.' While experience from specific groups of countries may be of&#13;
particular interest, as discussed below, the conclusions and recommendations of the&#13;
Policy Paper continue to provide the main policy considerations and options relevant to&#13;
reform VTE, particularly preemployment training for youth, which is the main focus of&#13;
the proposed project.&#13;
1.29  The main thrusts of reform as proposed in the Policy Paper are as follows:&#13;
(a) introducing market-oriented planning of training by using labor market signals rather&#13;
than manpower forecasting; (b) mobilizing employer and private training and ensuring&#13;
that training providers can compete under conditions which are fair to both private and&#13;
public providers; and (c) making public training more responsive and efficient, and&#13;
diversifying sources of funding for publicly provided training. These policy directions&#13;
have been fully considered in the design of the proposed project, taking into account the&#13;
specific institutional and economic situation in China.&#13;
l Vocational and Technical Education and Training. A World Bank Policy Paper (1991).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
1.30 The project also responds to lessons learned from previous Bank Group-assisted&#13;
VTE projects implemented worldwide. Projects in Ecuador, Egypt and Mexico (see&#13;
SecM94-0754, SecM95-0239, and SecM92-0117) highlight the need for strong links&#13;
between VTE institutions and local employers to ensure the responsiveness of training&#13;
supply to demand. The proposed project meets this criterion by being based on&#13;
individual school plans developed in consultation with local enterprise representatives.&#13;
Project support to the ongoing decentralization of China's VTE system is in line with a&#13;
lesson learned in Egypt and Morocco (SecM95-0922)-that decentralization of training&#13;
responsibility is one of the main ingredients for a flexible, responsive training system.&#13;
The value of tracer studies, a lesson from our experience in Mexico, is also incorporated&#13;
in the project, which would improve the monitoring and evaluation systems of&#13;
participating schools with the intention, among others, of tracking trainees in their job&#13;
performance.&#13;
1.31  Lessons have also been learned from the previous Bank Group-supported VTE&#13;
project in China (Cr. 2114-CHA), which is scheduled to close at end-1996. The previous&#13;
project assisted the development of about 60 SEdC and MOL secondary VTE schools in&#13;
selected provinces, to act as models for fiurther development, by providing facilities and&#13;
equipment, improving teaching materials and providing staff training and technical&#13;
assistance. Implementation has been largely as envisioned, and a 1995 review of the&#13;
project by SEdC highlighted some of the project's positive results. Internal efficiencies&#13;
of the schools improved, with higher student-teacher ratios and increased enrollments.&#13;
Sixteen of the schools have been designated as "national key schools." School financing&#13;
also diversified as a result of substantially increased income from tuition and school-&#13;
owned enterprises. The schools' external efficiency also seems to have improved,&#13;
judging from the increased fee income which can be regarded as a proxy for market&#13;
success. On the negative side, the schools found some training and technical assistance&#13;
offered under the project to lack relevance, and the project's goal of improving overall&#13;
programs in schools spread throughout 17 provinces was overambitious. A more focused&#13;
approach, in terms of both geographical coverage and subject areas, would have been&#13;
preferable.  The proposed project incorporates these lessons, and builds on the&#13;
achievements of its predecessor. Technical assistance and training under the project&#13;
would be delivered in a way that is preferred by the Borrower, that is, through a twinning&#13;
arrangement with leading VTE institutions in Singapore, which has one of the most&#13;
efficient VTE systems worldwide. This arrangement brings down costs, obviates the&#13;
need for language training, and is perceived as being highly relevant to the Chinese&#13;
context. In addition, school improvements would be targeted at only five geographic&#13;
areas and to selected specializations for which demand is strong and potential financing&#13;
sources for the specializations promise to be robust.&#13;
1.32  In addition, experience gained outside Bank Group projects has been noted,&#13;
particularly that from other Asian economies, considered more relevant than Eastern&#13;
Europe and the former Soviet Union, which have been grappling with severe economic&#13;
recession and widespread unemployment. The rapid industrial development which has&#13;
taken place in Asia in the past 15 years has, without exception, been supported by well-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-10-&#13;
functioning and integrated vocational training systems. In the cases of Singapore, Korea&#13;
and Hong Kong, the close linkage between the VTE system and employers in industry&#13;
has contributed greatly to rapid development and quality improvement. China's best&#13;
policy is to follow the same route, and it could clearly benefit from drawing extensively&#13;
and in detail on the experience of those nearby countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2. PROJECT DESIGN AND PREPARATION&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
2.1   As is typical of all economic and social reform efforts in China, changes in&#13;
China's VTE system are being introduced gradually, and only after extensive piloting of&#13;
new measures. The Bank has been assisting the pilot efforts through the previous VTE&#13;
project, the proposed project focused on SEdC, and the recently approved Labor Market&#13;
Development Project, supporting MOL in testing the impact on labor market&#13;
development and labor mobility of improved employment and training services and an&#13;
enhanced policy and legal framework for workers and employers. The proposed project&#13;
would be a pilot program to complement the latter effort by testing the impact on training&#13;
efficiency and effectiveness of improved curricula, teacher training and a package of&#13;
institutional and management improvements in what is still the main conduit for VTE&#13;
training, the SEdC-run secondary schools. Since the existing system's links with industry&#13;
are now often with SOEs, the project would also help the SEdC schools forge new ties&#13;
with additional nonstate enterprises and develop new skills training programs for the&#13;
nonstate sector.&#13;
2.2   The project aims to improve the management of the participating institutions,&#13;
including the setting up of mechanisms to obtain and use labor market signals in the&#13;
running and fine-tuning of programs, improving links with industry, increasing income&#13;
from sources other than education budget allocations, and devolution of responsibility to&#13;
the schools under clearly defined terms of accountability.  Within the selected&#13;
specializations, which cover both manufacturing and services sectors, there would be a&#13;
program of curriculum development, with a modular structure and competency-based&#13;
course system.&#13;
B. ISSUES IN PROJECT DESIGN&#13;
2.3   The proposed project is consistent with economic principles and equity&#13;
considerations. It does not jeopardize the growth of emerging, privately operated VTE&#13;
institutions; it complements employers' training efforts; and it will indirectly increase&#13;
demand for less skilled workers by contributing to enterprise growth.&#13;
Level Playing Field&#13;
2.4   Government intervention in training usually has to be justified by the&#13;
identification of market failures of one kind or another. In China, the context is very&#13;
different: it is not so much that the market is failing as that it does not yet exist. The&#13;
question then becomes whether to move towards markets by building on what already&#13;
exists or by destroying and replacing it. The logic of this project is to build on what&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12-&#13;
already exists, reforming the public VTE system, which is large, experienced and linked&#13;
to enterprises, so that it can become self-supporting and responsive. At the same time,&#13;
the aim is to avoid crowding out the private training institutions which are beginning to&#13;
emerge in the larger cities but are still few, weak, and mainly confined to quick-profit,&#13;
low-investment and short-course specializations. A level playing field in this context&#13;
does not imply a complete absence of subsidy to secondary vocational and technical&#13;
schools: the general-education part of the curriculum is still a proper state function. The&#13;
schools are already raising 42 percent of their current funding excluding production&#13;
income and expenditure from nongovernment sources; hence the playing field is very&#13;
nearly level and it will become more so during the course of this project.&#13;
Precareer vs. Employer Training&#13;
2.5   The public VTE system has a high share in precareer training and China's special&#13;
situation in this respect has to be recognized. Extraordinarily fast growth, together with&#13;
structural change and upgrading of technology and product quality, means that vast&#13;
numbers of new skilled workers are demanded each year. Inplant training alone is unable&#13;
to cope with imparting skills to new recruits on this scale; it needs to be supplemented by&#13;
offplant, precareer training. In any case, as full cost recovery for VTE courses becomes&#13;
the norm, enterprises will be able to choose between precareer and inplant training on&#13;
rational cost/benefit grounds.&#13;
Training and Equity&#13;
2.6    A condition for obtaining a high rate of return on investment in training is that&#13;
demand for trained persons should be high. This is the logic behind locating the&#13;
proposed training project in five of the country's highest-income and fastest-growing&#13;
areas. This, almost by definition, implies that the project will not be an instrument for&#13;
direct improvement of equity. The impact of the training on equity will be indirect. By&#13;
relieving skill constraints to expansion of higher-quality output and exports, it will&#13;
generate increased demand for less skilled workers also. As already emphasized, China is&#13;
still a surplus-labor economy. The boom in the coastal provinces is based primarily on&#13;
labor released from rural areas, often from beyond those provinces' borders.  For&#13;
instance, nonagricultural employment In Shandong and Guangdong grew at an annual&#13;
average rate of 5 percent and 7 percent, respectively, between 1989 and 1994, to the&#13;
benefit of millions of unskilled recruits from poorer families. One effect of the project&#13;
will be to make a small contribution to the continuation of this process.&#13;
Project Preparation and Stakeholder Participation&#13;
2.7   The project was prepared by the Government with Bank Group assistance using a&#13;
bottom-up approach with emphasis on participation from candidate provinces, local&#13;
government administrations and schools. Project provinces were selected using criteria&#13;
focusing on the -presence of rapid industrialization, employment-driven demand, and&#13;
commitment to plan and manage the reform of vocational education. Information on the&#13;
areas selected, the Provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Liaoning and Shandong and Tianjin&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
Municipality, is provided in Annex 2. Selection of participating schools and institutions&#13;
was the responsibility of the provinces based on agreed criteria including: (a) registration&#13;
as local-level key schools, (b) potential to meet local labor market needs, (c) existing&#13;
enrollment of at least 1,000 students with plans to increase to about 2,000 over five years,&#13;
(d) reasonable teaching conditions and competent management, and (e) demonstrated&#13;
potential to meet project objectives and to support sustainable development beyond the&#13;
duration of the project.&#13;
2.8   Each potential project school prepared a development plan covering: (a) baseline&#13;
data on students, teachers, courses, and facilities; management, expenditure and&#13;
financing, linkages with industry, and employment outcomes of courses; (b) plans for&#13;
development over the next five years guided by the agreed reform agenda, including new&#13;
courses, additional facilities to be acquired, proposed management development, staff&#13;
development and training requirements; and (c) the implications for capital investment&#13;
and recurrent costs. About 25 percent of the 82 project schools were visited by the&#13;
preappraisal mission for detailed evaluation of their plans, and subsequently the&#13;
Provincial Education Commissions and SEdC revised and consolidated the plans to&#13;
provide the basis for project design in the form of a Project Implementation Plan (PIP).&#13;
The preparation was financed by a grant from the Governrment of Japan. The PIP and&#13;
development plans for all project schools are in the Project File (Annex.11).&#13;
C. RATIONALE FOR BANK GROUP INVOLVEMENT&#13;
2.9   The proposed project is consistent with the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy&#13;
(CAS) for China, which was presented to the Board on June 1, 1995 and reaffirmed on&#13;
March 26, 1996. That strategy has as its ultimate objective to assist the Government in&#13;
developing the institutions and instruments necessary to sustain rapid growth and broad-&#13;
based development. By pilot testing crucial improvements to the quality and market-&#13;
responsiveness of the country's vocational and technical secondary schools, the project&#13;
represents one building block in developing a labor market in China that can provide well&#13;
trained workers in the skills most sought by the market. And, since the project schools&#13;
also provide inservice training and other types of adult education, including training&#13;
programs directly contracted with employers, the project supports the Bank's emphasis&#13;
on helping the Government reform its state-owned industries by facilitating labor&#13;
mobility. Workers needing enhanced skills as enterprise reform continues will be able to&#13;
get the training required at the model VTE schools to be developed under the project, or&#13;
at schools replicating these reforms. As such, the project complements other investment&#13;
and technical assistance operations outlined in the CAS for industrial restructuring,&#13;
vocational training and economic law reform, all geared to establishing a comprehensive&#13;
framework of the basic policy and investment measures required to promote enterprise&#13;
reform throughout China. In particular, the project draws on two important Bank sector&#13;
studies: the 1992 study on China's urban employment and wage system, which produced&#13;
an action plan for employment and wage reforms (Report No. 1 0266-CHA) and the 1993&#13;
study on the employment and training implications of enterprise reform (Report No.&#13;
1 1785-CHA).&#13;
&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1   In support of labor market development, economic restructuring, and SOE reform,&#13;
the proposed project would: (a) improve and increase the supply of skilled labor to meet&#13;
labor market demands; (b) raise the quality and efficiency of the vocational education and&#13;
training system; and (c) build up capacity for monitoring, evaluation and dissemination of&#13;
pilot experiences and replication.&#13;
--     B. PROJECT MONITORING&#13;
3.2   Progress in achieving the project's development objectives would be monitored&#13;
on the basis of impact and outcome indicators shown in Annex 1. These indicators would&#13;
be derived from a subset of detailed indicators at project and school level, measuring&#13;
outcomes and impact and would be consolidated by each province and submitted to the&#13;
center. The physical progress of implementation would be monitored against annual&#13;
implementation plans to be prepared by the provinces/municipality and participating&#13;
schools. Key overall indicators would include the following:&#13;
(a)   Project effectiveness in increasing the supply of skilled labor&#13;
(i)   Percent of graduates from project institutions employed six months&#13;
after graduation&#13;
(ii)   The average salary of graduates compared with workers of a&#13;
similar age who have not received preservice training&#13;
(b)   Improved quality and efficiency&#13;
(i)   Percent of project schools attaining National Key School Status&#13;
(c)   Enhanced monitoring, evaluation and dissemination&#13;
(i)   Number of project provinces preparing annual VTE plans based on&#13;
cost and outcome analysis&#13;
(ii)   Percent of schools with fully operational tracer studies/feedback&#13;
systems&#13;
3.3   At the school level, the chief monitoring parameters and indicators would be:&#13;
(a)   Improved school management and efficiency&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
(i)    Average unit cost per trainee year compared to nonproject schools&#13;
(ii)   Percent utilization of labs/workshops compared to nonproject&#13;
schools&#13;
(iii)   Percent financing from industry and tuition fees&#13;
(iv)    Ratio of trainers to administrative staff&#13;
(b)   Improved market-oriented planning and links with industry&#13;
(i)   Percent of project school graduates employed in joint venture or&#13;
(private) town and village enterprises&#13;
(ii)    Average starting salary of project school graduates compared with&#13;
vocational schools at the same level&#13;
During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the participating provinces/&#13;
municipality and schools would prepare semiannual project progress reports, which&#13;
would be submitted to SEdC. SEdC would consolidate these reports and submit the&#13;
overall report to the Bank Group by April 1 of each year, reporting on the status of&#13;
project implementation, including progress made with regard to the agreed monitoring&#13;
indicators. In addition, an Interim Report would be prepared for each Bank Group&#13;
supervision mission prior to its arrival. An implementation completion report, reviewing&#13;
the planned objectives and project achievements, including costs and benefits derived,&#13;
would be prepared by SEdC and submitted to the Bank Group no later than six months&#13;
after the loan/credit Closing Date.&#13;
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.4   The project, to be implemented in the Provinces of Guangdong, Jiangsu, Liaoning&#13;
and Shandong and the Municipality of Tianjin, would have the following components:&#13;
(a)   Development of Key Schools for Vocational Education;&#13;
(b)   Improving Management and Planning of Vocational Education; and&#13;
(c)   Supporting Project Management.&#13;
Development of Key Institutions for Vocational Education ($56.8 Million)&#13;
3.5   This component would support the development of 82 key secondary technical&#13;
and vocational schools as models for upgrading the quality and efficiency of vocational&#13;
education. Since the project input is relatively small, the revision and upgrading of&#13;
training programs would be targeted to priority aspects of selected specializations. The&#13;
upgrading would be achieved through an integrated program of: (a) course revision and&#13;
curriculum development; (b) staff development and training; (c) international and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
domestic technical assistance; and (d) the upgrading and equipping of laboratories and&#13;
workshops. The assistance to each school would be based on a detailed plan, focused on&#13;
one or two fields or majors which represent the priorities for local or regional economic&#13;
development. The emphasis would be on the reform of training to make the system more&#13;
flexible and responsive to changing employment demand and opportunity, in line with&#13;
evidence from improved labor market information systems and strengthened links with&#13;
industry.&#13;
3.6   The main thrust of development would be on the following sectors and&#13;
specializations, which were identified by the locals schools and enterprises as priority&#13;
employment skill needs:&#13;
(a)   electronics, electrical engineering&#13;
(b)   mechanical engineering, including machinery and automobile engineering&#13;
(c)   construction&#13;
(d)   light manufacturing industry&#13;
(e)   communications, road and traffic engineering&#13;
(f)   computer applications, informnation technology&#13;
(g)   chemical industry&#13;
(h)   tourism, including hotel services.&#13;
3.7   Over 60 percent of the specialized courses to be upgraded are in the fields of&#13;
electronics, electrical engineering, mechanics, machinery, electromechanics and&#13;
information technology, which cover the core skills for modem industrial development.&#13;
Other main concentrations are 10 percent in construction, 5 percent in chemical&#13;
processes, 6 percent in textiles and garments, and 8 percent in hotel services and tourism.&#13;
3.8   Enrollments in the training programs in the above fields in the project schools are&#13;
expected to increase from about 42,000 to about 60,000 in full-time preemployment&#13;
courses over the project period. A relatively larger increase is foreseen in enrollments in&#13;
part-time and specialist short courses for retraining or skills upgrading of existing&#13;
workers.&#13;
3.9   Upgrading of VTE Training Programs: Course Revision and Curriculum&#13;
Development. The SVS and STS programs would be upgraded through the design,&#13;
testing and implementation of selected new and revised course modules. The courses&#13;
would be selected in accordance with their priority for economic development and&#13;
employment needs. Modules of industrial practice would also be upgraded and included&#13;
as an integral part of all vocational courses. The related system for examination of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
students' attainment and competencies and the vocational qualifications and certification&#13;
at national, provincial and school levels would also be critically reviewed and upgraded.&#13;
3.10   Staff Development. The skills and experience of teachers would be upgraded&#13;
through a staff training program, which would be closely integrated with the course&#13;
upgrading. Sixty key specialist teachers from the project schools in the majors of&#13;
electronics, mechanics, electromechanics, information technology, construction and&#13;
chemical processing would be trained overseas in three-month custom-designed courses,&#13;
with a focus on modem teaching methods, particularly for laboratory and workshop&#13;
teaching. The trained key teachers, after return to their schools, would continue the&#13;
upgrading of courses, including curriculum development, preparation of teaching&#13;
materials, laboratory manuals, computer-based learning materials and textbooks. Course&#13;
development would be facilitated by a program of seminars and workshops, assisted by&#13;
specialist consultants. Both consultants and trained key teachers would design and&#13;
participate in the delivery of the domestic training program for other school teachers,&#13;
which will also be based on the revised course materials and upgraded teaching methods.&#13;
3.11   Specialist teachers in other courses targeted for project support would be trained&#13;
in domestic, custom-designed programs, using the experience and resources of selected&#13;
schools and institutions assisted under the first Bank Group-assisted VTE project. The&#13;
latter would be chosen to assist with staff training and course upgrading on the basis of&#13;
their demonstrated successful development in the field, links with overseas institutions,&#13;
and close association with international or joint venture enterprises in the sector.&#13;
3.12   Specialist staff in all targeted courses would participate in a domestic training&#13;
program to include:&#13;
(a)   Modular programs for upgrading technical skills and training methods as&#13;
well as enhanced refresher training in laboratory and workshop practicai&#13;
exercises and project work, particularly based on the revised courses and&#13;
use of equipment procured under the project (para. 3.15). The program&#13;
would be delivered in selected technical teacher training colleges and key&#13;
schools, with participation and supervision of senior school staff,&#13;
including the teachers who have been trained overseas;&#13;
(b)   Secondment or assignments for supervised training and experience in&#13;
industry.  This program  would be designed and supervised at the&#13;
provincial level by an advisory group comprising representatives from&#13;
industry, the model schools and administrators; and&#13;
(c)   Comprehensive courses, of two to three years' duration, leading to&#13;
professional qualifications, for selected teachers who were not able to&#13;
secure a full degree before entering the profession.&#13;
3.13   Specialist Consultant Services.  Specialists would be engaged to assist in&#13;
improving courses and the related staff training in fields for which key staff would be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
trained abroad; i.e., electronics, mechanics, electromechanics, information technology,&#13;
construction and chemical processing. The specialists would guide the groups of key&#13;
teachers, after return from overseas training, through programs of seminars and&#13;
workshops for curriculum development and preparation of new teaching materials. They&#13;
would also participate in the design and implementation of the domestic staff training&#13;
program. The outline of the program for employment of specialists, their terms of&#13;
reference, and criteria for selection were confirmed at appraisal (Annex 9).&#13;
3.14  The consultants and overseas training services would be provided, as far as&#13;
possible, through links with vocational education systems in Asia where the Chinese&#13;
language is conmmonly used. It is expected that these services would be provided under a&#13;
twinning arrangement with institutions in Singapore, well-known for their successful&#13;
VTE programs. Under these circumstances, SEdC has agreed to waive the normal&#13;
requirement that candidates for overseas training pass an English language proficiency&#13;
test. This decision would facilitate timely implementation of the project since that&#13;
requirement has been an important factor in hampering implementation of overseas&#13;
training in earlier projects.&#13;
3.15  Upgrading of Training Facilities. Laboratory and workshop facilities of the&#13;
project schools would be upgraded through construction of new, and adaptation of&#13;
existing, buildings and by the provision of appropriate, up-to-date equipment. Equipment&#13;
to be procured under the project was selected by the project schools, under the guidance&#13;
of an experienced panel of advisers and in light of experience gained in the procurement&#13;
and use of equipment under the first Bank project in this subsector. The equipment lists&#13;
for the schools and summary lists by province were reviewed by the Bank Group and&#13;
found acceptable in terms of their appropriateness and recurrent cost implications. In&#13;
terms of project investment per student, it would be about Y 1,100 per student per year in&#13;
equipment compared to about Y 300 at present.&#13;
Improving Management and Planning of Vocational Education ($1.0 Million)&#13;
3.16  Complementary to the upgrading of school curricula, instructor training and&#13;
physical facilities, this component would improve planning and management of the&#13;
system through provision of technicalassistance and management training, improved&#13;
planning, linkages with industry and dissemination of best practices.&#13;
3.17  Management Improvements. The project would finance overseas study visits,&#13;
domestic seminars and workshops to prepare school principals and other management&#13;
staff to take responsibility for implementing the reforms at provincial and school level.&#13;
The overseas training would comprise structured overseas study assignments, following&#13;
custom-designed programs, for groups of selected managers and principals to examine&#13;
international approaches and experience of key features of VTE management and&#13;
development.&#13;
3.18   Reform of the VTE system would depend on improvement to the management&#13;
system at provincial and school level and further strengthened links with employers in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
accordance with central Government policy (para. 1.26). Since 1985, there has been&#13;
remarkable progress in the implementation of the policy for vocational education, but as&#13;
is the case for social sector development, provinces and also schools are moving at&#13;
different pace primarily dependent on industrial development and demand for skilled&#13;
manpower. In this context, this pilot project would contribute to achieving the overall&#13;
reform goals and related actions and activities would be closely monitored by Bank&#13;
supervision using, inter alia, the monitoring indicators as defined in para. 3.2.&#13;
3.19  This will include further decentralization of management responsibilities to&#13;
encompass staff selection and recruitment, enrollment of students, curriculum and syllabi&#13;
design and revision, utilization of staff and physical resources, and financial&#13;
responsibility in accordance with annual budgets and plans. Monitoring and evaluation&#13;
will play an important role in assuring quality and accountability and will include regular&#13;
assessment of external and internal efficiency. For this purpose, the school-based labor&#13;
market information system would be strengthened including tracer studies and feedback&#13;
from employers to facilitate planning at the school and provincial level.&#13;
3.20 Planning Improvements. Planning for VTE would be improved through use of&#13;
the monitoring and evaluation system described above and better use of available labor&#13;
market information (LMI) in preparing annual and long-term (three-year) school and&#13;
provincial-level VTE plans. Consultant services, staff training and seminars would be&#13;
provided to develop a school-based LMI system. Building on already established&#13;
practices, the project would assist participating schools to: (a) collect information from&#13;
graduates on their labor market situation and earnings; (b) compare this information on&#13;
outcomes with similar information from appropriate comparison groups to measure the&#13;
impact of different types of training; and (c) analyze the cost of each course run by the&#13;
school so that cost per student of each course can be calculated for comparison with&#13;
impact. Procedures would be developed through which the criterion of cost per unit of&#13;
impact is used, among others, in decision by schools on changes in curricula. The labor&#13;
market information collected at the school level would be forwarded to the local&#13;
government and provincial levels for planning purposes and dissemination of findings on&#13;
the impact of training to potential trainees and employers.&#13;
3.21   Links with Industry. Links with industry would be formalized by establishing&#13;
Industrial Advisory Committees (IACs) to ensure employer participation in the selection&#13;
of courses and feedback on student performance following employment. Also, the&#13;
introduction of School Governing Boards (SGBs) with industrial representation would&#13;
assist in planning and management of schools and be responsible to the administering&#13;
authority.&#13;
3.22  Dissemination. As part of the dissemination effort under the project, links&#13;
between key schools and clusters of other vocational schools in the same community&#13;
would be established to extend the experience of successful activities developed under the&#13;
project through inservice instructor training; workshops and seminars on improved&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
systems and procedures for planning and management, course development and teaching&#13;
methods, and sharing of specialists.&#13;
Project Management Support ($0.4 Million)&#13;
3.23   In order to decentralize implementation responsibility, training would be provided&#13;
for project management staff at the provincial and school levels. At the provincial level,&#13;
this would mainly encompass general project management areas such as planning and&#13;
coordination of implementation, financial administration, procurement, monitoring and&#13;
evaluation, and project reporting.  At the school level, training would emphasize&#13;
monitoring of training program quality and efficiency, local staff development, and&#13;
procurement of equipment and materials by national shopping procedures. Project&#13;
management training and technical assistance would be provided by SEdC's Foreign&#13;
Investment and Loan Office (FILO), which has long experience in implementing Bank&#13;
Group education projects. Additionally, the specialist panels will contribute to selection&#13;
of equipmnent and appropriate staff development programs.&#13;
D. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
3.24   The total project cost is estimated at $68.4 million equivalent with a foreign&#13;
exchange component of $14.0 million including contingencies. Taxes and duties of $0.3&#13;
million equivalent are included in the total cost. Base cost estimates reflect price levels&#13;
prevailing in January 1996. The unit prices were derived from the following sources:&#13;
(a) quotations obtained from manufacturers and suppliers; (b) prices of goods and works&#13;
from recent contracts; and (c) construction costs according to prices published by the&#13;
Central and Provincial/Municipal Governmnents, all adjusted for inflation. Physical&#13;
contingencies of 5 percent were applied to the base costs of goods and the following price&#13;
contingency rates were applied to all the components: for local expenditure: 10.5 percent&#13;
for 1996, 8.5 percent for 1997, 7.0 percent for 1998, 6.5 percent for 1999 and 6.2 percent&#13;
for 2000; for foreign expenditures: 2.4 percent for 1996 through 2000. The project cost&#13;
summary by component is shown in Table 3.1 and project cost by expenditure category is&#13;
presented in Table 3.2. The detailed cost summaries by province are presented in&#13;

would together finance about 44 percent of total project costs, including 100 percent of&#13;
total foreign exchange requirements, and about 29 percent of local costs net of taxes. The&#13;
project provinces, Tianjin Municipality, and SEdC would contribute the balance and&#13;
annually make budgetary allocations for the recurrent expenditures required during and&#13;
after project implementation. A financing plan is shown in Table 3.3. Assurances were&#13;
obtained at negotiations that the Borrower would make the proceeds of the Loan and&#13;
Credit available to the project provinces and Tianjin Municipality on the following&#13;
terms: repayment in 20 years with 5 years of grace, at an interest rate of 4 percent per&#13;
year. The provincial/municipal governments would bear the foreign exchange risk and&#13;
would relend the loan/credit proceeds to project institutions on the same terms.&#13;

E. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.26  Procurement procedures and arrangements satisfactory to the Bank Group would&#13;
be agreed with the project provinces/municipality. All procurement would be undertaken&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's Procurement Guidelines, dated January 1995 and revised&#13;
in January 1996. Procurement responsibility would be shared by FILO and the&#13;
provinces/municipality. FILO, through its procurement agent-the China National&#13;
Technical Import Company (CNTIC}-would manage procurement of goods under&#13;
international competitive bidding (ICB) procedures and of international consultant&#13;
services. CNTIC is an experienced and competent procurement agent that is familiar&#13;
with, and has had recent and relevant experience in ICB on Bank Group-financed&#13;
projects. The tender documents to be used in the project would be based on the standard&#13;
bid documents prepared by the Ministry of Finance and approved by the World Bank&#13;
Group. The provinces/municipality would handle all other procurement procedures,&#13;
including national competitive bidding (NCB). The credit and loan would finance&#13;
procurement of instructional equipment, computers, books, materials, international and&#13;
local consultant services and training. The Bank Group's standard documents would be&#13;
used for all procurement procedures. Expected procurement arrangements under the&#13;
project are summarized in Table 3.4 and given in detail in Annex 3.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
3.27  Civil Works ($24.0 million). All civil works would be procured and financed by&#13;
the provincial governments using local competitive procedures which are acceptable to&#13;
the Bank Group. All proposed works are extensions or complementary units of small size&#13;
which are not anticipated to attract foreign bidders. A substantial part of these works&#13;
have already reached the tendering stage.&#13;
3.28 Equipment, Materials and Books ($41.9 million). Procurement of equipment&#13;
and materials with a contract value of $200,000 or above would be procured under ICB&#13;
procedures. Contract packages valued at more than $50,000 and less than $200,000&#13;
equivalent up to an aggregate amount of $30.3 million would be procured under NCB&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank Group. Individual contracts valued at less than&#13;
$50,000 equivalent up to an aggregate amount of $1.98 million would be procured&#13;
through national shopping based on at least three written quotations. The value of ICB&#13;
packages for equipment is expected to be between $400,000 and $600,000 and would&#13;
include equipment for training such as computers with peripherals, advanced electronics&#13;
and telecommunications training equipment, and instruments for measurement and&#13;
analysis. Under ICB, local manufacturers would be eligible for a margin of preference in&#13;
bid evaluation of 15 percent of the CIF price or the prevailing rate of custom duty, which&#13;
ever is lower. The value of NCB packages is expected to be between $100,000 to&#13;
$200,000 and would include standard equipment for skills training such as machine tools,&#13;
electrical tools and workshop instruments. Experience from the first vocational training&#13;
project indicates that local suppliers of the above types of equipment are highly&#13;
competitive and previous ICB for similar equipment has elicited little foreign supplier&#13;
interests. Combined with the desirability of decentralizing procurement to the provinces,&#13;
the type of equipment to be procured justifies a higher than normal proportion of NCB&#13;
compared to ICB in the project. The use of standard bidding documents ensures that&#13;
foreign bidders are not excluded from NCB.&#13;
3.29  Consultant Services and Training ($2.3 million).  The selection and&#13;
employment of consultants would be in accordance with the World Bank's "Guidelines&#13;
for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency-August 1981." Consultants would be engaged using the Bank's&#13;
Standard Forms of Contract for Consultants' Services-June 1995. It is anticipated that&#13;
consultant services would total about 42-person-months, and all of the major part may be&#13;
procured through sole source procurement under a twinning arrangement which would&#13;
take into account both technical and language requirements (refer to para. 3.14). In that&#13;
case, one or more contracts, including both international TA and training, valued at about&#13;
$1.8 million could be approved. All other consultant services would be procured locally&#13;
using local procedures acceptable to the Bank. Employment of consultants for the major&#13;
part of technical assistance would be a condition for disbursement for procurement of&#13;
equipment associated with that part of the technical assistance.&#13;
3.30  Review of Bid Documents and Contracts.  Procurement of instructional&#13;
equipment, computers and books with a contract value of $200.000 or above would be&#13;
subject to prior review by the Bank Group.  Prior review coverage would be of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
approximately 26 percent of all contracts as a result of small contracts expected under&#13;
NCB with 82 schools in five provinces having different equipment requirements. All&#13;
contracts for consultant services, with a value of $50,000 or above for individuals and&#13;
$100,000 or above for firms, would also be subject to prior review by the Bank Group.&#13;
However, the exceptions to prior review do not apply to (a) the terms of reference for&#13;
contracts, (b) single source selection of consulting firms, (c) assignments of critical&#13;
nature, as reasonably determined by the Bank Group, (d) amendments to contracts for the&#13;
employment of consulting firms raising the contract value to $100,000 equivalent or&#13;
above, or (e) amendments to contracts for the employment of individual consultants&#13;
raising the contract value to $50,000 equivalent or above.&#13;
F. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
3.31   The proposed credit of $20 million equivalent and loan of $10 million equivalent&#13;
would be disbursed over a period of five years on the following basis: (a) equipment and&#13;
materials' 100 percent of foreign expenditures; 100 percent of local expenditures (ex-&#13;
factory); and 75 percent of expenditures for other items procured locally; and&#13;
(b) consultant services and training: 100 percent of expenditures.&#13;
3.32  Disbursement would be made against statements of expenditure for expenditures&#13;
of less than: $200,000 equivalent for equipment and materials; expenditures of less than&#13;
$100,000 and $50,000 equivalent for consulting services for firms and individual&#13;
consultants respectively. Supporting documents for statements of expenditure would be&#13;
retained by the provincial/municipal project offices and the central SEdC project&#13;
management office and would be made available for inspection during Bank Group&#13;
supervision missions and by external auditors. All other disbursements would be made&#13;
against fully documented expenditures. To expedite disbursement, a Special Account&#13;
would be established and maintained in US dollars by the Ministry of Finance in a bank&#13;
acceptable to the Bank Group. An authorized allocation in the amount of $3 million&#13;
would be deposited into the special account, but the initial deposit would be limited to $2&#13;
million until the aggregate withdrawal shall be equal to or exceed the equivalent of $6&#13;
million. Replenishment of the Account would be made monthly or when the Account has&#13;
reached 50 percent of the initial deposit.&#13;
3.33  The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2002 and the closing date&#13;
would be December 31, 2002. The estimated schedule of disbursements in Annex 8 is&#13;
somewhat faster than the average disbursement profile for education projects in China&#13;
due to the small size of the project and experience gained by SEdC in implementing the&#13;
previous VTE project.&#13;
G. ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT&#13;
3.34  Separate  project  accounts  would  be  maintained  by  the  project&#13;
provinces/municipality and consolidated by FILO. The State Audit Administration&#13;
(SAA) would have overall responsibility for auditing project accounts, and this&#13;
arrangement is satisfactory. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the Borrower&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
would ensure that separate project accounts are maintained by the participating schools&#13;
and provinces and that an annual audit report of project accounts, the Special Account&#13;
and a separate opinion on Statements of Expenditure would be prepared by an&#13;
independent auditor acceptable to the Bank Group and submitted to the Bank Group&#13;
eight months after the close of the Borrower 'sfiscal year.&#13;
H. PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
Implementation Arrangements&#13;
3.35  Consistent with the bottom-up approach taken in preparing this project, its Project&#13;
Implementation Plan (PIP) has been prepared based on the 82 detailed School&#13;
Development Plans provided by the participating schools, where in turn were based on a&#13;
series of workshops comprising trainers, school leaders, enterprise representatives and&#13;
concerned government staff. The PIP is available in the Project File and is summarized&#13;
below. An overall Project Implementation Schedule is summarized in Annex 3. A&#13;
Project Implementation Agreement (PLA) detailing arrangements for project&#13;
implementation would be entered into between the Borrower and each project&#13;
province/municipality on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank Group. This&#13;
would be a condition of Loan and Credit effectiveness.&#13;
3.36  Responsibility for implementation would be shared between the center, the&#13;
provincial and local governments, and the schools themselves. The detailed allocation of&#13;
implementation responsibilities is shown in Table 3.5. The implementation procedure&#13;
adopted recognizes the special nature of this project, particularly: (a) the relatively small&#13;
size of the loan and credit; and (b) the objective of supporting government reform and&#13;
development, including management reform and decentralization, which require that&#13;
project activities be integrated into the overall policy and management framework for&#13;
vocational education. The teams established during project preparation, consisting of&#13;
SEdC staff and consultants at the central level and Provincial Education Commission&#13;
(PEdC) staff strengthened by consultants and industry representatives at the local level,&#13;
would be maintained and provide support and advice during implementation. During&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained that SEdC would cause the participating schools&#13;
and provinces to prepare detailed annual plans for project implementation during the&#13;
coming year, then consolidate the plans and submit the consolidated plan to the Bank&#13;
Group for comment by October 15 of each year. Thereafter, the plans would be carried&#13;
out, taking Bank comments into consideration. During negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtained that training and technical assistance would be carried out in accordance with&#13;
plans satisfactory to the Bank Group with assistance from consultants.&#13;
Organizational Structure for Implementation&#13;
3.37  The organizational structure for project implementation would have three levels:&#13;
the Central Government level represented by SEdC; the provincial/municipal level&#13;
represented by the Provincial/Municipal Education Commissions (PEdCs/MEdC); and&#13;
the local level represented by the Education Offices of counties, cities, municipalities,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
and Provincial Technical Bureaus and the participating schools themselves. A project&#13;
implementation chart is presented in Annex 5.&#13;
TABLE 3.5: ALLOCATION OF IMPLEMENTATION RESPONSIBILITIES&#13;
Central/SEdC              1. Overall Coordination of Implementation, including: (a) establishment of&#13;
systems, procedures, guidelines and regulations; and (b) coordination of&#13;

- planning and implementation of physical development of the schools&#13;
- planning and implementation of staff development programs&#13;
- planning and implementation of course, training program and materials,&#13;
revision, upgrading and development&#13;
--   e monitoring and evaluation of progress&#13;
2. Financial administration for all activities for which they are assigned&#13;
implementation responsibility, drawing on loan/credit funds from the&#13;
Special Account and on counterpart funds provided by participating local&#13;
government authorities.&#13;
3. Procurement of equipment through NCB and National Shopping&#13;
County/District/School    I. implementation of the programs of improving quality and efficiency of&#13;
vocational education&#13;
2. Staff training and materials development&#13;
3. Procurement of equipment, books etc. through National Shopping within&#13;
defined limits&#13;
3.38   Central Level.  A National Project Steering Committee (NPSC), chaired by&#13;
SEdC, and SEdC's Foreign Investiment Loan Office (FILO) would have primary&#13;
responsibility for implementation, to be carried out in consultation with other SEdC&#13;
departments and offices, including Finance and Vocational Education Departnents.&#13;
FILO, would be responsible for coordinating and supporting project implementation,&#13;
including regular reporting to the Bank and assisting Bank supervision missions at the&#13;
center and in the provinces. It would also handle procurement under ICB and recruitment&#13;
of international consultants. Overall guidance on project implementation would be&#13;
provided by the National Project Steering Commnittee. In addition, a permanent Chinese&#13;
Expert Panel (CEP) would be established to advise SEdC and PEdCs on substantive&#13;
aspects of vocational education reform as well as on project implementation and&#13;
coordination Assurances were obtained at negotiations that SEdC would maintain FILO&#13;
as the overall responsible body for project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
3.39  Provincial Level.  At this level, Provincial Project Advisory Committees&#13;
(PPACs) would be established to provide overall guidance of provincial-level project&#13;
activities, which would be managed on a day-to-day basis by Provincial Project&#13;
Implementation Offices (PPIOs). The PPACs would meet at least every three months to&#13;
discharge their duties. The participating Provinces' authorities, coordinated by the&#13;
PEdCs, in collaboration with city and municipal authorities, would be responsible for&#13;
implementation of the project programs in the project schools under their control, and for&#13;
ensuring that the reform and improvements achieved by these schools are monitored,&#13;
evaluated, disseminated, and extended to other schools in each participating Province's&#13;
vocational education system. The Provincial authorities would also provide financial&#13;
management for all activities under their responsibility, and manage non-ICB&#13;
procurement. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that the Borrower would&#13;
cause the PPIOs to be established and maintained for the duration of the project, with&#13;
functions and responsibilities satisfactory to the Bank Group, and with competent staff in&#13;
adequate numbers.&#13;
3.40  Local Level. To enable local (subprovincial) authorities to coordinate project&#13;
activities and disseminate project findings to nonproject schools, Local Government-level&#13;
Coordinating Committees (LGCCs) would be set up covering the administrations of all&#13;
project schools. At each participating school, a School Project Planning Implementation&#13;
Offices (SPPIO) would be established to coordinate project-related activities. Assurances&#13;
were obtained at negotiations that the Borrower would cause the SPPIOs to be&#13;
established and maintained for the duration of the project, with functions and&#13;
responsibilities satisfactory to the Bank Group, and with competent staff in adequate&#13;
numbers.&#13;
3.41 In addition, permanent School Governing Boards (SGBs) and School Industrial&#13;
Advisory Committees (SIACs) would be established at each project school to participate&#13;
in project implementation in their respective areas of competence. Assurances were&#13;
obtained at negotiations that the Borrower would cause the SGBs and SIACs to be&#13;
established and maintained for the duration of the project, with functions and&#13;
responsibilities satisfactory to the Bank Group.&#13;
3.42 The participating schools would be responsible, in close collaboration with&#13;
provincial and national authorities, for the detailed implementation of the reform effort,&#13;
including an active participation in curriculum and training materials development,&#13;
teacher and administrator training, and equipment selection, specification, and evaluation,&#13;
as well as in the monitoring and evaluation of school and graduate performance at school&#13;
and in the labor market. The head of each SPPIO would report directly to the school&#13;
principal and through him/her, to the relevant PPIO. The SGBs would assist the&#13;
management of each school on matters of finance and administration. The SIACs would&#13;
provide a mechanism to ensure full participation of employers in the planning, delivery&#13;
and evaluation of training.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
I. SUPERVISION&#13;
3.43  Bank Group supervision of the project would focus on the monitoring indicators&#13;
shown in Annex 1, and the review and evaluation of progress in implementing the annual&#13;
work programs to be prepared by the participating provinces/municipality and schools.&#13;
The results of monitoring and evaluation carried out by the implementing agencies, using&#13;
the improved systems to be introduced under the project, would also be considered. An&#13;
indicative supervision plan is shown in Annex 7. Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that the SEdC would carry out a mid-term review ofproject progress before&#13;
December 31, 1998. If warranted by the results of the review, changes would be made to&#13;
the project's scope, implementation arrangements, etc.&#13;
J. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
3.44  The proposed project would have no environmental impact and has a "C"&#13;
classification. Facilities to be constructed or enlarged for the project schools would entail&#13;
no land acquisition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
4. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
4.1   The project would spur further reform of the VTE system, particularly by making&#13;
the system more demand driven, and increasing the amount of funding obtained from&#13;
nongovernment sources. The project is designed to make the schools more responsive to&#13;
market demand by enterprises and employers participation in SIACs and SGBs at each&#13;
school. In addition, the new equipment to be provided by the project is seen as a catalyst&#13;
enabling new courses to be started and staff to be upgraded which would enable project&#13;
schools to respond more efficiently to market demands. This improved response is&#13;
expected-to attract more funds from enterprises (and more fees from students), thus&#13;
enabling equipment to be replaced continuously as it becomes obsolete, and courses to be&#13;
reconfigured and revised as market demand for skills changes. In the 82 project assisted&#13;
schools, enrollment would increase from 42,000 to 60,000, 60 instructors would be&#13;
trained overseas and in country and about 80 principals and provincial managers would&#13;
benefit from study visits and domestic training.&#13;
4.2   The project would also benefit graduates of the participating schools who, by&#13;
receiving better quality and more relevant vocational education, should be able to find&#13;
suitable initial employment and, more important, to secure continued career development.&#13;
Inservice training to be provided by the project schools would also benefit SOE staff who&#13;
need to improve their skills in keeping with the needs of their restructured enterprises.&#13;
Enterprises and other employers in the project areas would benefit from the availability of&#13;
a better trained pool of skilled workers, facilitating improved production quality,&#13;
increased productivity, and more efficient management. And, if the curriculum and&#13;
management reforms to be tested under the project are judged effective, project initiatives&#13;
would be replicated in other schools in the provinces, and would expand the range of&#13;
benefits realized.&#13;
Economic Justification&#13;
4.3   The project represents the least-cost solution to furthering VTE reform and&#13;
enhanced training quality in economically important specializations. In the absence of a&#13;
significant private sector VTE system, the SEdC-run secondary schools are currently the&#13;
most appropriate institutions to address China's preservice technical training needs.&#13;
These schools are well established, are basically sound and, in the case of the schools&#13;
selected for participation in the project, are committed to the reforms to be fostered under&#13;
the project. Project inputs have been carefully targeted to areas already possessing a&#13;
strong market orientation, at schools that have already achieved a reasonable standard,&#13;
and at technical specializations in great demand by both trainees and enterprises. Project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
inputs maximize the impact of the relatively modest level of support being provided.&#13;
Physical investments have been screened to ensure their cost-effectiveness and&#13;
sustainability, while considerable effort was made to ensure stakeholder acceptance of&#13;
project technical assistance as well as its suitability and strong potential for success.&#13;
4.4   It would be desirable to calculate an internal rate of return on the proposed&#13;
investments; however, the necessary data are not complete. While a tracer study carried&#13;
out in January 1994, as part of project preparation, collected data on average current&#13;
monthly earnings of secondary vocational school (SVS) and secondary technical school&#13;
(STS) graduates, no data are available on earnings of comparison groups. Neither the&#13;
State Statistical Bureau's national household survey nor the Ministry of Labor's&#13;
establishment survey collect the individual records, including earnings, that are needed&#13;
for this purpose. However, school-level data were collected during project preparation,&#13;
from which inferences may be made about the impact of VTE on productivity and about&#13;
private rates of return. The fact that SVSs obtain 32 percent and STSs 20 percent of their&#13;
current funding (excluding production income and expenditure) from tuition fees suggests&#13;
that many of the courses mounted by both types of school offer a high private rate of&#13;
return to individuals.&#13;
4.5    Further, the relatively high proportion of current funding obtained from&#13;
enterprises (14 percent for SVSs and 18 percent for STSs) suggests that emplovers also&#13;
enjoy a private rate of return on some of the courses offered. Data from Jiangsu Province&#13;
on source of sponsorship of first-year students give a preliminary indication as to which&#13;
courses are attractive and to whom. Those with a presumably high private rate of return&#13;
as perceived by students include, in SVSs, computer and business studies, automobile&#13;
driving and repair, and chemical, electronic, and machinery assembly trades; and in STSs,&#13;
computer studies, foreign trade, and electronic machinery. Those with a presumably high&#13;
private rate of return to employers include, in SVSs, automobile trades, tourism and&#13;
machinery trades; and in STSs, chemical, electrical, electronic, machinery and textile&#13;
trades. Investments to improve the quality and management of training as well as&#13;
monitoring of external efficiency, as planned under the project, will help to increase&#13;
social rates of return by further improving the productivity impact of VTE. They will&#13;
also attract more funds from enterprises and more fees from students, thus further&#13;
increasing the proportion of income obtained by the schools from nongovernment&#13;
sources.&#13;
Sustainability&#13;
4.6    The proposed project investments are considered sustainable. Fees from students&#13;
and increased financial support from enterprises are generally expected to cover most of&#13;
the incremental costs of the specialized courses supported under the project.  The&#13;
project's institutional sustainability would benefit from project-supported technical&#13;
assistance and training provided by successful VTE institutions in Singapore. Financial&#13;
sustainability would benefit from significant stakeholder participation in the project&#13;
design process. Project design was developed from a series of workshops comprising&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
enterprise representatives, employers, school principals and concerned government&#13;
agencies. Based on this, project inputs and activities for the schools were identified by&#13;
the schools themselves and incorporated into overall school development plans. These&#13;
plans were then reviewed by a panel of local experts and the Bank Group, and the&#13;
schools, in consultation with the review panel, adjusted their proposals with a view to&#13;
ensuring adequate future operations of the envisioned investments and activities. The&#13;
incremental recurrent funding requirements as a result of the project are therefore modest&#13;
and considered manageable. Project schools would also be encouraged under the project&#13;
to increase their cooperation with local enterprises in terms of school management,&#13;
selection of training programs and increased financial contribution. Their self-financing&#13;
capacity is therefore expected to increase, reinforcing the likelihood that investments&#13;
would be maintained and equipment updated as needed. Overall sustainability of the&#13;
VTE system will depend on the schools' success in forging strong relationships with local&#13;
industries and enterprises. It is the aim of the project to strengthen these linkages, which&#13;
already exist for many schools, and to reorient the schools to serving China's growing&#13;
number of joint ventures and commercialized enterprises. Mechanisms directed at the&#13;
latter goal include panels of school advisers from a range of major local industries and an&#13;
enhanced labor market information system allowing schools to identify market demands.&#13;
Incremental Costs&#13;
4.7   The project's implications for the government budget are approximately neutral.&#13;
According to 1993/94 figures provided by provincial education bureaus, salaries&#13;
represent about 46 percent of total current expenditure of the secondary vocational and&#13;
technical schools in the project provinces, compared with 7 percent on student stipends, 5&#13;
percent on pensions, 15 percent on office expenses, 15 percent on maintenance and 12&#13;
percent on materials (for production as well as training purposes). The project's main&#13;
impact on the structure of expenditure will be on salaries, office expenses, maintenance and&#13;
materials/ depreciation. Plausible assumptions may be of a 10 percent rise in the salaries&#13;
costs (due to salary increases for upgraded staff rather than an increase in staff numbers,&#13;
thanks to improvements in efficiency and staffl/student ratios); a 10 percent increase in&#13;
office expenses (reflecting the extra costs associated with monitoring, evaluation and labor&#13;
market information); a 10 percent rise in maintenance costs; and an increase in spending on&#13;
materials and depreciation of as much-as 50 percent (reflecting the depreciation cost of the&#13;
new equipment, in particular). A package of this kind would place no extra burden on the&#13;
government budget, as long as the proportion of the schools' expenditure financed from&#13;
nongovernment sources rose from 47 percent to 53 percent. This is a modest target for such&#13;
a reform project and based on available data on demand from enterprises, should be&#13;
achievable.&#13;
Replicability&#13;
4.8    Although the project would directly benefit only a relatively small number of&#13;
schools, the upgraded systems and programs would provide models for dissemination&#13;
throughout the project provinces, and nationally. Project elements most suitable for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
replication include: (a) upgraded modular courses and training materials; (b) training of&#13;
technical teachers, including improved domestic inservice training programs, and teacher&#13;
training provided by the project key schools for staff of other schools in the province; and&#13;
(c) experience from management reforms. The benefits of enhanced, more relevant&#13;
training would be evaluated and the results disseminated to encourage an increasing&#13;
number of enterprises to extend and upgrade their participation in such training, including&#13;
assumption of an increasing share of the cost.&#13;
B. RisKs&#13;
4.9   The main project risks are institutional and financial. A risk exists that the&#13;
participating schools would not be able to carry out the project as envisioned. Mitigating&#13;
this possibility are: the bottom-up approach taken to project design, allowing the schools&#13;
to understand fully and be involved in the dimensions and requirements of the plans; the&#13;
experience of the project provinces and SEdC with other Bank Group projects, experience&#13;
that can be shared with the project schools; and the technical assistance and training&#13;
included in the project specifically to buttress implementation capacity.&#13;
4.10  There is also a risk of delay in bringing about change and improved training due&#13;
to delays in foreign experts' participation in the project and in training programs. Care&#13;
has therefore been taken during project preparation to minimize this risk by maintaining a&#13;
continued, detailed dialogue on training programs with the participating schools, by&#13;
closely integrating consultant support with those programs, and by developing an&#13;
innovative twinning arrangement for delivery of foreign technical expertise in a mode&#13;
suited to the Chinese context. Client ownership of project technical assistance and&#13;
training has been regarded as essential to success. Project conditionality would require&#13;
recruitment of key technical assistance as a condition of loan/credit effectiveness and&#13;
project training programs according to an agreed timetable.&#13;
4.11   On the financial side, there is a risk of underfunding the recurrent costs of&#13;
upgraded VTE programs and spreading available resources too thinly. This risk has been&#13;
dealt with by involving participants closely in the project design process to ensure a&#13;
realistic project scope tailored to available resources, and by limiting improvements and&#13;
their costs in each school to only one er two priority specializations for which demand is&#13;
high and mostly assured. Incremental recurrent costs caused by the project investment&#13;
are estimated to be modest and are expected to be covered by nongovernment financing&#13;
(para. 4.7).&#13;
&#13;

province/municipality on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank&#13;
Group as a condition for loan/credit effectiveness (para. 3.35);&#13;
(b)   Employment of consultants for the major part of technical assistance&#13;
would be a condition for disbursement for procurement of equipment&#13;
-     associated with that part of the technical assistance (para. 3.29);&#13;
(c)   SEdC would prepare and submit to the Bank Group by April 1 of each&#13;

ANNEX 2: SOME ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF VOCATIONAL&#13;
EDUCATION AND TRAINING IN PROJECT PROVINCES&#13;
Introduction&#13;
1.    In analyzing the economics of vocational education and training (VET) in China,&#13;
several special conditions have to be borne in mind. The first is the phenomenal rate of&#13;
economic growth. Over the 1987-1993 period real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)&#13;
increased at an annual average rate of 9 percent. Currently, with real GDP increasing by&#13;
12 percent in 1994 (and with double-digit growth again expected in 1995), China is the&#13;
fastest growing economy in Asia, the world's fastest growing region.&#13;
2.    Secondly, the government is following an incrementalist approach to the&#13;
transition from central planning to markets. Reform of institutions, including enterprises&#13;
and the labor market, is gradual, with the emphasis on building on what there is, rather&#13;
than smashing and replacing. Growth plus gradualism have meant that the wvelfare costs&#13;
of transition have been lower in China than in Europe and the incidence of poverty has&#13;
fallen.&#13;
3.    A third point concerns the relative size and strength of the public and private VET&#13;
systems. The public VET system is large, experienced and linked to enterprises. Private&#13;
training institutions are beginning to emerge in the larger cities. In Qingdao (Shandong&#13;
province), for instance, there are around 400, offering short courses in computer&#13;
applications, foreign trade, business, music, garment making and designing, etc. In&#13;
Dalian (Liaoning) they concentrate on secretarial, accounting and computer keyboard&#13;
skills. In the smaller cities, such as Anshan (Liaoning), their quality and quantity is&#13;
described as low, and they offer short courses in elementary word-processing. In general,&#13;
they are few and weak, and mainly confined to quick-profit, short-course specializations.&#13;
4.    Each of these special conditions has implications for VET. Fast growth, together&#13;
with structural change and upgrading of technology and product quality, means that vast&#13;
numbers of new skilled workers are needed each year. In 1993 one in 15 industrial&#13;
workers had probably been recruited during the past year; in the services sector the ratio&#13;
was even higher, maybe one in ten. Inplant training alone is unable to cope with&#13;
imparting skills to new recruits on this scale: it needs to be supplemented by offplant,&#13;
precareer training.&#13;
5.    Secondly, the gradual pace of reform means that there is still a long way to go,&#13;
particularly in restructuring of SOEs. This presents dangers as well as opportunities for&#13;
the public VET system. Insofar as its close relations with employers are based on the old&#13;
system, they may become more rather than less difficult to maintain and enlarge, as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -                      ANNEX2&#13;
enterprise reform accelerates and the number of nonstate enterprises increases.&#13;
Increasingly profit-conscious enterprises will need to be convinced that investment in&#13;
offplant training pays off: new relationships, new skills, and new courses will be needed&#13;
for this purpose.&#13;
6.    Thirdly, the need for the public VET system to become self-supporting and&#13;
responsive to industry's needs, while not crowding out private training institutions (the&#13;
so-called level playing field), is generally agreed. This does not necessarily imply a&#13;
complete absence of subsidy for secondary vocational and technical schools: the general-&#13;
education part of the curriculum is still a proper state function. The aim of every school&#13;
should be to raise income to cover the costs of the rest of the curriculum: this will vary&#13;
between schools and specialization but is unlikely to exceed 60 percent of current costs.&#13;
The Provinces and Their Schools&#13;
7.    The project will be implemented in four provinces, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Liaoning&#13;
and Shandong, and one municipality, Tianjin, all located on the coast. Table 1&#13;
summarizes some recent economic indicators.&#13;

8.    These are prosperous provinces by Chinese standards. GDP per head in the&#13;
lowest case, Shandong, is 19 percent above the national average. They are also among&#13;
the most dynamic areas of the country, with all except Liaoning exceeding the national&#13;
average growth rate for the year of 12 percent. Tianjin is a special case. The fact that it&#13;
is an urban area accounts for its high figures for GDP, exports and foreign investment per&#13;
head, and for its large proportion of employment in the second sector: however, it is&#13;
lagging in the process of reform, with a relatively underdeveloped tertiary sector and with&#13;
nonagricultural employment still dominated by SOEs. Of the provinces, Guangdong's is&#13;
clearly the most reformed economy, with a relatively small proportion of nonagricultural&#13;
workers in state enterprises, the highest ratio of employment in the tertiary sector to that&#13;
&#13;

in the secondary sector, the highest figures for exports and foreign investment per head,&#13;
and an amazing 19 percent growth rate. Shandong is less industrialized and with lower&#13;
income, exports and foreign investment per head, but scores well on such indicators of&#13;
reform as relative size of tertiary sector, and non-SOE as a percentage of nonagricultural&#13;
employment. Jiangsu is in an intermediate position as far as exports and foreign&#13;
investment per head are concerned, and has a relatively small tertiary sector, but rivals&#13;
Guangdong in the development of non-SOE employment. Liaoning has the highest GDP&#13;
per head of the four provinces, but in many ways has the greatest transitional problems.&#13;
Its economy is still dominated by heavy industry and by SOEs, its services sector is&#13;
relatively small, and it is attracting relatively little foreign investment.&#13;
9.    The provinces differ also in the management and orientation of their secondary and&#13;
vocational technical schools, to judge from an analysis of responses to questionnaires&#13;
returned by 78 project schools, distributed as shown in Table 2.&#13;

10.   Provinces appear to differ in their approach to cooperation with enterprises. In&#13;
two cases, Shandong and Tianjin, all the project schools obtain regular advice from&#13;
employers, usually through their membership of management or advisory committees. In&#13;
Jiangsu and Guangdong, on the other hand, only a minority of schools make such&#13;
arrangements. Most provinces have selected schools oriented towards industry: Liaoning&#13;
is the exception, obviously intending to use the project to boost its underdeveloped&#13;
services sector. All provinces have difficulty in keeping salaries for their teaching staff&#13;
up to levels prevailing in the private sector: not surprisingly, this is particularly the case&#13;
in Guangdong, where the private sector is most dynamic. In Guangdong, also, the&#13;
schools seem to be the most SOE-oriented: only 50 percent of project schools send 30&#13;
percent or more of their graduates to the private sector, compared with more than 70&#13;
percent of schools in Jiangsu and Liaoning.&#13;
Demand, Outcomes and Impact&#13;
11.   Unemployment is not a useful indicator of the labor market situation in China. In&#13;
all five provinces the official unemployment rate is probably near the national average of&#13;
2.6 percent. However, this figure refers to urban areas only, excluding job-seekers from&#13;
rural areas who are not officially urban residents. In addition, there are large numbers of&#13;
surplus workers in SOEs. As far as secondary school leavers are concerned, as might be&#13;
expected from Table 1, the labor market in these provinces is booming. The 1993 tracer&#13;
study of SVS and STS leavers found no unemployed, and none were reported by any of&#13;
the project schools. There seems to be no difference between vocational/ technical and&#13;
academic school leavers in this respect.&#13;
12.   Information about what happens to school leavers is widely available.  For&#13;
instance, the 1993 tracer study found that 89 percent of 1992 graduates from STSs and 50&#13;
percent of those from SVSs were first employed in SOEs. The data collected from the&#13;
project schools is consistent with this: the median was 82 percent of 1994 graduates of&#13;
STSs to SOEs, 54 percent in the case of SVSs. The tracer study also found average&#13;
current monthly earnings of secondary vocational school (SVS) and secondary technical&#13;
school (STS) graduates employed in organizations other than the government&#13;
administration and SOEs to range (depeDding on the type of organization) from Y 117 to&#13;
Y 650 for the 1988 cohort, from Y 115 to Y 300 for the 1990 cohort, and from Y 112 to&#13;
Y 301 for the 1992 cohort. Schools regularly collect other data on outcomes. What is&#13;
lacking is information about the impact of vocational/technical education. That is, what&#13;
difference does it make to the labor market experience of its graduates?&#13;
13.   Impact is difficult to estimate for various reasons. There is the usual difficulty of&#13;
selecting a comparison group. In China, as in many other countries, the cream of lower&#13;
secondary school leavers goes to upper secondary academic (or general) schools; the&#13;
vocational/technical schools get the rest. Therefore, a comparison between vocational/&#13;
technical and upper secondary general graduates is not valid. A fairer comparison would&#13;
be between two groups of lower secondary school leavers of five or six years earlier, all&#13;
with comparable marks in school-leaving examinations. One group would consist of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-40 -                       ANNEX2&#13;
those who went through vocational/technical education, the other of those who found&#13;
other routes (probably including a short training course). The difference between the&#13;
subsequent labor market experience of the two groups would measure the impact of&#13;
vocational/technical education. No such comparison-group data are available.&#13;
14.   Indeed, no individual-record data of the kind that could be used in estimations of&#13;
impact (and of rates of return) on VTE are currently available. The National Household&#13;
Survey collects data on the age, sex, education, occupation and employment of individual&#13;
household members, but not of their earnings. The Ministry of Labor in its Establishment&#13;
Survey, aggregated data on average wages and average years of schooling of different&#13;
categories of workers, but not in the individual-record form needed for impact estimation.&#13;
It also conducts an occasional household survey, which does include individual records&#13;
but not in a form that is usable for this purpose. The most recent published data from this&#13;
survey are for 1992.&#13;
15.   Another reason for the difficulty of impact estimation is the still underdeveloped&#13;
state of the labor market. Unemployment among such graduates is negligible, and a large&#13;
proportion still works for state enterprises, where wages are still largely determined by&#13;
administrative rules.&#13;
16.   In these circumstances a useful indicator of the relative marketability of different&#13;
types of graduates (and, by inference, the private rate of return on their training) is&#13;
provided by the proportion of students in each specialization who are either sponsored/&#13;
contracted by enterprises or paying for themselves. Table 3 shows the situation in the&#13;
case of Jiangsu province.&#13;
17.   This table suggests that there are significant differences in private rates of return&#13;
between specialization. Any specialization with a significant proportion of private fee-&#13;
paying students must be offering a high expected private rate of return to individuals.&#13;
Any specialization with a high proportion of enterprise-sponsored students must be&#13;
offering a high private rate of return to the employers involved. In both cases a positive&#13;
impact on productivity can be inferred. Conversely, questions must be asked about the&#13;
specialization in which a high propotion of students are government-assigned. A&#13;
difference in orientation between SVS and STS is apparent in these respects. At SVS&#13;
level, there seems to be relatively little interest among industrial enterprises in sponsoring&#13;
trainees, except in machinery trades; employers in the services sector are more interested,&#13;
particularly in automobile trades (repair and driving), tourism and computer studies.&#13;
Computer and business studies and automobile driving and repair are also relatively&#13;
popular among private students, in addition to chemical and electronic machinery trades:&#13;
these are also the specialization that private training institutions are likely to become&#13;
interested in. At STS level, industrial enterprises sponsor relatively more students,&#13;
particularly in chemical, electrical/electronic, machinery and textile trades: some of these&#13;
also attract private students, as do computer studies and foreign trade.&#13;

Costs&#13;
18.   A careful comparison of the relative costs of general and vocational/technical&#13;
education has not yet been undertaken in China, but two provinces have provided the&#13;
figures on current expenditure per student in different types of secondary education,&#13;
shown in Table 4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

19.   The pattern is largely as expected, with higher levels more costly than lower&#13;
levels, and vocational/technical more costly than general (with the exception of SVS in&#13;
Guangdong). However, the comparability of the figures is in doubt. Short-term students&#13;
in vocational/technical schools are excluded from  the denominator:  in 1993/94,&#13;
Guangdonfg SVS and STS had 205,000 and 69,000 such students respectively, while in&#13;
Shandong the comparable figures were 190,000 and 1.7 million. Also, expenditure&#13;
figures include pension payments to retired teachers to a varying extent.  Further&#13;
investigation is needed.&#13;
20.   Vocational/technical schools differ from general schools in the amount of funding&#13;
that they obtain from nongovernrent sources. As Table 5 shows, this amounted to 47&#13;
percent of current revenue in 1993/94.&#13;

21.   As can be seen, SVSs are more successful than STSs in obtaining nongovernment&#13;
funds. Provinces also vary: Shandong is the least, Guangdong the most reliant on&#13;
government funding. Shandong is particularly successful in attracting finance from&#13;
enterprises. Liaoning has the highest proportion of funding from tuition fees. Some of&#13;
the reasons for these differences are explored in Table 6.&#13;

22.    Schools that involve enterprise representatives in their management seem, as&#13;
might be expected, to be significantly more successful in raising money from enterprises.&#13;
This may be one of the reasons for the relative lack of such success by Guangdong and&#13;
Jiangsu (see Table 2 above). Schools oriented toward the secondary sector are slightly&#13;
more successful in attracting funding from enterprises, while those oriented towards the&#13;
tertiary sector are able to attract a significantly higher proportion of fees: this may&#13;
account partly for the pattern of Liaoning's funding shown in Table 2. Interestingly, the&#13;
payment of competitive salaries to teachers seems to be less important in attracting&#13;
enterprise sponsors than it is as an attraction to individual fee-payers! Rather ominously,&#13;
schools still relying on state enterprises to employ their graduates attract a higher&#13;
proportion of finance from enterprises than those more geared to nonstate enterprises&#13;
(which are, however, able to attract a higher proportion of tuition fees).&#13;
Summary of Findings&#13;
23.   An important purpose of the project is reform of the VET system, particularly in&#13;
the sense of increasing the amount of funding obtained from nongovernment sources.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44 -                       ANNEX2&#13;
New equipment is mainly seen as a catalyst for reform, enabling new courses to be started&#13;
and staff to be upgraded, with multiplier effects across the VET system. This will attract&#13;
more funds from enterprises (and more fees from students) and thus enable equipment to&#13;
be continuously replaced as it becomes obsolete.&#13;
24.   Targets for nongovernment funding need to be set by each school, sufficient to&#13;
cover the cost of the technical/vocational part of the curriculum (including its proportion&#13;
of overheads). On average, schools are already remarkably successful in raising such&#13;
finance, equivalent to 47 percent of current funding, 52 percent for SVSs alone. Several&#13;
schools are probably already on target, but there are also many (particularly among STSs)&#13;
which are not. The easier way of raising such funds may be to lay on courses which&#13;
attract tuition fees, but many of these (low-level business and computer studies,&#13;
automobile repair and driving, secretarial courses, etc.) can more efficiently be left to&#13;
private training institutions as they gradually develop: it may be that the comparative&#13;
advantage of the public system is in courses which attract funds from enterprises.&#13;
25.   To this end, those schools that do not already involve enterprise members in&#13;
school management (particularly in Jiangsu and Guangdong provinces) need to make&#13;
such arrangements as soon as possible. Several schools could be used as models in&#13;
designing such systems. Relations with enterprises need to be widened to include more&#13;
nonstate enterprises. Contacts with township/village enterprises seem to be particularly&#13;
weak, with a few exceptions.&#13;
26.   Schools that do not have contracts for training with enterprises need to learn from&#13;
those that do. Even more important, schools that are not receiving an adequate fee from&#13;
enterprises for contract training, need to learn from schools which are successful in&#13;
negotiating adequate training fees. And schools that bear the full cost of inplant training&#13;
practice need to learn from schools which persuade enterprises to pay for it.&#13;
27.   The school office responsible for relations with enterprises should also be&#13;
responsible for finding out what has happened to graduates. As the labor market&#13;
develops, the focus of such tracer studies will need to change, from a survey of opinions&#13;
of employers to a set of questions direcwed towards graduates, covering: whether they are&#13;
working or not working; if working, in what occupation; their earnings; relevance of&#13;
training to their job; and, if not working, whether unemployed or outside the labor force.&#13;
This information will need to be compared with similar information on appropriate&#13;
comparison groups, in order to measure the impact of different types of training. They&#13;
can be supplemented by indicators of the relative marketability of different types of&#13;
graduates, of the kind shown in Table 3. The same office should also analyze the cost of&#13;
each course run by the school, so that cost per graduate of each course can be calculated,&#13;
for comparison with impact. The effective use of cost-per-unit-of-impact estimates in the&#13;
redesign of curricula will also need to be ensured.&#13;
28.   Production income (6% of total revenue) raises some special issues. In most&#13;
cases, school accounts seem to show gross income from production, which will be offset&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

by connected expenditure on materials, power, supervisors' time, etc. There are three&#13;
categories of production unit in schools:&#13;
(a)   those using only student labor, with the primary purpose of training.&#13;
Customers should always be expected to pay for the products of these&#13;
units, but they should not become profit-driven.&#13;
(b)   those using nonstudent labor, with the primary purpose of making a profit,&#13;
but the secondary purpose of providing students with training practice.&#13;
(c)   those using only nonstudent labor, with the sole purpose of making a&#13;
profit, and no training function.&#13;
The mission saw examples of all three categories in visits to schools. Categories (b) and (c)&#13;
are notproblematic, but (a) can become so. Periods spent in production units should never&#13;
be longer than necessary for training purposes. If it is not possible to reproduce industrial&#13;
conditions, inplant training practice is preferable.&#13;

ANNEX 10: REPORT ON A TRACER STUDY OF GRADUATES&#13;
FROM SECONDARY VOCATIONAL AND TECHNICAL&#13;
SCHOOLS, JANUARY 1994&#13;
1.    The absence of systematic data on outcomes has long been an obstacle to&#13;
development of policy on vocational education and training in China. When the first&#13;
World Bank vocational education project was prepared, for instance, the only such&#13;
information available was a list of specializations offered by schools and summary&#13;
estimates of placement of SVS graduates in four provinces.' Partly for this reason, it was&#13;
decided to precede preparation of a second project by a more systematic tracer survey of&#13;
technical/vocational school graduates, intended to throw light on the issue of extemal&#13;
efficiency.&#13;
2.    Fifty-three schools, including secondary vocational schools (SVS), secondary&#13;
technical schools (STS) and some multifunction/combined schools were purposely&#13;
selected from  18 cities and counties in Jiangsu, Hebei and Shandong provinces and&#13;
Beijing. In each of these schools principals were asked to select (purposely by course but&#13;
randomly within courses) 20 graduates from each of the years, 1988, 1990 and 1992, to&#13;
whom the questionnaire shown in appendix A was administered. The survey was carried&#13;
out and processed at high speed (between the first mission in November 1993 and&#13;
February 1994).-&#13;
3.    Table I shows the characteristics of the respondents to the survey, classified by&#13;
broad subject category and type of school. Among the 2,218 respondents in this table&#13;
there is, as can be seen, a wide range of subject coverage, with engineering, agriculture/&#13;
forestry and finance/accounting the largest categories.&#13;

4.    Table 2 shows the pattem of response by subject and year of graduation.' As can&#13;
be seen, there are slightly fewer respondents from earlier years (because of smaller course&#13;
enrollments in those years) but the difference is not great enough to affect analysis. The&#13;
questionnaire did not contain a question about unemployment (or job waiting) but, as far&#13;
as can be ascertained, the incidence of unemployment among those contacted was&#13;
negligible.4&#13;

3 The total in this table is 2,157. The discrepancy with Table I apparently arises because of unanswered&#13;
questions, but the number of nonrespondents has not been recorded in any of the Tables.&#13;
4 This is in line with expectations, given the state and nature of the labor market and the lapse of time&#13;
between graduation and survey.&#13;

5.     Table 3 shows the number of graduates in each year who had been sponsored in&#13;
one way or another by enterprises. The fact that the proportion sponsored has reached 26&#13;
percent in the case of the most recent graduates, and that 42 percent of sponsorship over&#13;
the whole period took the forrn of sponsorship of whole classes, is evidence of the close&#13;
links between enterprises and technical/vocational schools, probably unique among&#13;
developing countries, as well as of the overheated state of Chinese markets for skilled&#13;
labor.&#13;

6.     Table 4 shows how sponsorship and its form varied between subjects for the 1992&#13;
cohort. The highest rate of sponsorship was, as might be expected, achieved by students&#13;
on hotel, catering and tourism courses, followed by the very small number of students of&#13;
foreign trade. Students of computing and engineering were also relatively attractive to&#13;
sponsors. Problem subjects, from the sponsorship point of view, are art and design,&#13;
agriculture and forestry, and health care.&#13;

7.      Similar evidence is provided by Table 5, which summarizes the routes through&#13;
which graduates found their first job. Only 1! percent of the latest batch were assigned&#13;
jobs by schools. In 1986, in contrast, the first project's sector report found that between&#13;
84 and 95 percent of the SVS graduates surveyed in four provinces were assigned to jobs&#13;
by the schools or the labor department. The categorizations of Table 4 are different, but&#13;
they do suggest that there has been important progress in the development of labor&#13;
markets for technical/vocational school graduates over the past few years.&#13;

8.      Table 6 shows how methods of finding a first job differed between students of&#13;
different subjects in the 1992 cohort. It illustrates the importance of practical attachment&#13;
in obtaining jobs for graduates in hotel, etc. studies, the apparently strong market position&#13;
of graduates in computing (50 percent of whom "selected firm") and the still relatively&#13;
high proportion of graduates in office and business administration placed by schools.&#13;

shows the fall in the proportion of graduates obtaining lifetime employment, to a mere 15&#13;

10.    Table 8 shows the variation between subjects in the type of employment obtained,&#13;
for the 1992 cohort. The least reconstructed subjects, in terms of the proportion still&#13;
obtaining lifetime employiment, are agriculture and health care, the most progressive&#13;
hotels/catering/tourism, finance/accounting, engineering and computing.&#13;

11.    Table 9 shows that there are also important differences between types of school in&#13;
the extent to which terms of service have changed. The proportion of STS graduates&#13;
obtaining lifetime employment in 1992 was still 34 percent, while for Combined School&#13;
graduates it was 14 percent and for SVS graduates as low as 1 percent. STS graduates are&#13;

these respects, of being less labor-market-oriented than other types of school, particularly&#13;
SVSs.&#13;

12.    Table 10 shows that, although their proportion has fallen, state owned enterprises&#13;
and government administration still dominate as destinations for graduates. Only 9&#13;
percent of 1992 graduates went into an enterprise with any private ownership.&#13;

shows, with 92 percent of STS graduates still ending up in government or SOEs,&#13;
compared with 60 percent of combined school and only 53 percent of STS graduates.&#13;
Joint ventures are clearly beginning to show interest in the last two categories.. The table&#13;
suggests that the tight connection between STSs and the state sector could usefullly be&#13;
loosened.&#13;

14.    Table 12 shows the variations between subject in the type of enterprise in which&#13;
1992  graduates were  first employed.   Interestingly, the  subjects with  the  highest&#13;
proportion going to state enterprises are hotels/catering and computing. Engineering&#13;
graduates are well represented in other types of enterprises, such as collectives, township&#13;
and village enterprises and joint ventures.&#13;

15.    Selection of the courses for the survey largely deterrnines the sectors to which&#13;
graduates go. Light and heavy industry is still the main destination, as Table 13 shows,&#13;
but the growing importance of the hotel, catering and tourism sector is indicated.&#13;

losing ground to the STSs in the catering sector.&#13;

17.    An indicator of the extent to which employers value school graduates is the&#13;
proportion who have been promoted or changed job since starting work, as shown in&#13;
Table 15. For the earliest cohort it is as high as 37 percent. A high proportion (in&#13;
relation to Chinese norms) has also changed employers, of whom 56 percent claimed to&#13;
have done so in search of better work conditions, 28 percent for higher wages, and 9&#13;
percent for a better location. This is a particularly interesting indicator of marketability&#13;
which is worth regular monitoring.&#13;

small sample of art/design and foreign trade graduates, the highest promotion rates were&#13;
achieved by office/business administration, engineering and hoteL/catering graduates,&#13;

19.    A final indicator of outcomes of training, shown in Tables 17, is average earnings.&#13;
Levels of earnings in government and SOEs are lower than in other types of enterprise.&#13;
In general, the current earnings of 1988 graduates in units other than government&#13;
administration and SOEs compare favorably with average national wage earnings (in the&#13;
bottom row of the table), given that such graduates have only been working for five&#13;
years.&#13;

20.    A fully-fledged cost/outcome analysis, using these wage data and the information&#13;
on cost, enrollment and output is not possible because of the lack of comparable data on&#13;
other types of school. If similar data were available on secondary academic schools, for&#13;
instance, the difference between the streams of earnings of secondary technical/vocational&#13;
school graduates and those of (otherwise similar) lower secondary general school&#13;
graduates could be compared with cost per graduate. Internal rates of return could even&#13;
be calculated if desired.5 Given the nature of the Chinese labor market (which on balance&#13;
still displays more of the characteristics associated with a planned rather than a market&#13;
economy) this would be a hazardous venture, but it would be worth attempting if the&#13;
control-group data were available.&#13;
21.    In their absence, the results of the survey reported on in this paper are consistent&#13;
with a trend towards improvement in the external efficiency of technical and vocational&#13;
schools. As many as one third of 1992 graduates had been sponsored by enterprises.&#13;
Most graduates now find jobs by other means than allocation, and an increasing&#13;
proportion use government labor exchanges for this purpose. The proportion obtaining&#13;
lifetime employment has dwindled and contracts are now the predominant arrangement.&#13;
The proportion finding jobs in government administration and state enterprises is still&#13;
high but falling. A high proportion of graduates had been promoted or changed jobs by&#13;
the time of the survey and the percentage who had changed employer was also high in&#13;
relation to national norms. And the current wages of 1988 graduates compare favorably&#13;
with national average earnings.&#13;
5 Although this would require estimating the additional costs of compensatory training of secondary&#13;
academic school graduates incurred by employers to bring them up to the initial level of&#13;
technical/vocational school graduates (estimated by some employers to take a few months).&#13;
