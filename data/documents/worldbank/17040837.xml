ANNEX 1&#13;
Description of Activities, Criteria for Allocation of Funds, and Expenditures under&#13;
the UFGE Multi-Donor Trust Fund&#13;
This Annex will be applicable to and form an integral part of all agreements&#13;
entered into between the Bank and entities (collectively, the "Donors") that provide&#13;
contributions (the aggregate of all contributions from the Donors, the "Contributions") to&#13;
be administered by the Bank for the Trust Fund.&#13;
A. DESCRIPTION OF ACTIVITIES&#13;
The main objective of the Trust Fund is to strengthen awareness, knowledge, and&#13;
capacity for gender-informed policy making and programs. The Trust Fund will support&#13;
activities that contribute to better gender-informed policy making at the country level by&#13;
increasing the availability of gender-relevant data and evidence; contribute to global&#13;
knowledge by road testing new evidence; and help raise awareness of and demand for&#13;
gender equality interventions by working in partnership with client governments, civil&#13;
society, research institutes, academia, the private sector, and development partners.&#13;
Activities&#13;
The Trust Fund will finance activities with a strong 'public good' element, as well as&#13;
those that are innovative and push the frontiers of gender equality work. Activities to be&#13;
financed by the Trust Fund will fall under three main priority areas:&#13;
I.      Increasing availability of gender-relevant data and evidence. Activities will&#13;
include addressing data gaps, making existing data more accessible and building&#13;
evidence in frontier areas and those where gender gaps persist.&#13;
II.     Road testing new evidence. Activities will include identifying relevant lessons&#13;
on how development practitioners can effectively translate new evidence into&#13;
results on the ground, such as strengthening and expanding successful&#13;
approaches.&#13;
III.    Leveraging partnerships to help advance gender equality. Under this&#13;
activity the Bank will engage civil society and private sector, especially from&#13;
developing client countries to identify, disseminate and implement innovative&#13;
gender equality initiatives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-6-&#13;
The implementation of the activities to be financed by the Trust Fund is as follows:&#13;
(I)   Bank-Executed Trust Fund Activities:&#13;
(a)   Activities related to priority areas I (Increasing availability of gender-&#13;
relevant data and evidence) II (Road testing new evidence), and III&#13;
(Leveraging partnerships) mentioned above.&#13;
(b)   Program   Management, Program    Administration  and  Knowledge&#13;
Management: The PREM Gender and Development Group (PRMGE) will&#13;
coordinate the day to day activities including leveraging global&#13;
partnerships,  aggregate  knowledge  management  activities  and&#13;
administering the Trust Fund, working in close collaboration with regions&#13;
and networks.&#13;
(II)  Recipient-Executed Trust Fund Activities:&#13;
(a)   Activities related to priority areas I (Increasing availability of gender-&#13;
relevant data and evidence), and II (Road testing new evidence).&#13;
B. CRITERIA FOR ALLOCATION OF FUNDS&#13;
The Gender and Development (GAD) Board is responsible for allocation decisions, and&#13;
ensuring that such allocations are aligned with the objectives of the UFGE and the&#13;
strategy for gender mainstreaming in the Bank.&#13;
The GAD Board will make allocation decisions based on the following general criteria:&#13;
* Alignment with the Bank's strategy for gender mainstreaming.&#13;
* Alignment with Regional needs and priorities, as laid out in the Regional Gender&#13;
Action Plans.&#13;
* Alignment with the overall objectives of the UFGE: to strengthen awareness,&#13;
knowledge and capacity for gender-informed policy making.&#13;
* Extent to which activities have a strong public-good rationale and/or are catalysts&#13;
for innovation and investment in frontier issues and persistent gaps.&#13;
Funds under the UFGE will mainly be allocated through:&#13;
B. 1. Strategic Allocations&#13;
a)     Strategic Activities: Activities related to priority areas I (Increasing&#13;
availability of gender-relevant data and evidence) II (Road testing new&#13;
evidence), and III (Leveraging partnerships) mentioned above.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿-7-&#13;
b)      Regional Block Grants (for both, Bank and Recipient execution):&#13;
These will cover a three-year period and be considered once every 18&#13;
months, depending on funding availability. Proposals must be endorsed&#13;
by the Regional Vice President. The GAD Board will review and&#13;
approve proposals based on the criteria above.&#13;
B. 2. Competitive Calls for Proposals&#13;
A portion of the Trust Fund may be used for competitive calls for proposals for&#13;
Bank executed activities. The intent of this mechanism is to incentivize Bank teams to&#13;
undertake activities in areas where the agenda on gender equality needs a push. It might&#13;
also be used to address areas where the implementation of the 2012 WDR is lagging.&#13;
A Technical Review Committee, consisting of World Bank experts, would be&#13;
convened to establish criteria for a call for proposals and to review and rank those that are&#13;
submitted. The GAD Board will endorse the criteria and clear the selection of proposals.&#13;
B. 3. PRMGE Managed Allocation&#13;
The focus under this allocation is priority area III (leveraging partnerships) as&#13;
described above, as well as activities that will include aggregate knowledge management&#13;
and UFGE's Program management and administration, to be carried out by PRMGE.&#13;
C.     ELIGIBLE CATEGORIES OF EXPENDITURE&#13;
For Bank-Executed activities the Contributions may be used to finance:&#13;
(a)   consultants' services (individuals and firms);&#13;
(b)   extended term consultants;&#13;
(c)   associated overheads (e.g., telephone, fax, internet connection expenses&#13;
during mission travel, telecommunications for learning events, etc.);&#13;
(d)   contractual services;&#13;
(e)   staff costs, benefits and indirects (e.g., communications, use of office&#13;
