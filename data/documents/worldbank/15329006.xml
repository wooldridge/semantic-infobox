&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:          Gentlemen, shall we come to order.        The first item on the agenia is the usual&#13;
(McCloy)&#13;
                   approval of the minutes.   You have all seen them.       Are there any connnents7&#13;
&#13;
                   If not, I declare them approved.&#13;
&#13;
                   Under the i tern of other business, we have had circulated to you recently&#13;
&#13;
                   the proposed report of the Executive Directors to the Board of Governors&#13;
&#13;
                   and a draft resolution of the Executive Directors.        Mr. Sunda.resan, have&#13;
&#13;
                   you anything to say about it?&#13;
&#13;
SUNDARESAN:        There is nothing more for me to add to what is in the report.        Mr. Kalecki&#13;
                   is writing to you accepting his nomination, and I have consulted informally&#13;
&#13;
                   with Mr. David Owen who said that from the U. N. point of view 1I there were&#13;
&#13;
                   no objections.&#13;
&#13;
BEYEN:             Is Mr. Kalecki still a Polish national?&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:          Yes.&#13;
&#13;
VARVARESSOS :      Mr. Chairman, may I ask one cpestion.        On page 2 it says that no Governor&#13;
&#13;
                   shall cast his vote before March 15th.        Yfuat is that restriction for,&#13;
&#13;
                   because it seems to be given great importance.        If it has to be followed,&#13;
&#13;
                   it must be so, because if any Government casts its vote before March 15th&#13;
&#13;
                   the vote is not valid.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:          What is the reason?&#13;
&#13;
SECRETARY:         It is a legal one.    Mr. Mclain can explain.&#13;
&#13;
McLAIN:            The reason is to ensure that the Governments have an opportunity to consult.&#13;
&#13;
                   It is a traditional practice.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                   - 732 -&#13;
&amp;#12;3ECRF'f ARY :    I t is provided for in Section       13 of the By-Laws.&#13;
&#13;
,!cLAIN:         We have followed it in all matters submitted to the Governors for voting&#13;
&#13;
                 without a meeting.&#13;
&#13;
I ARVARESSOS !   Is it in the By-Laws?&#13;
&#13;
lcLAIN:          Yes, it is.   Section 13 of the By-Laws reads in part as follow8; "votes&#13;
&#13;
                 shall be cast during such period as the Executive Directors may prescribe,&#13;
&#13;
                 provided that no Governor shall vote on any such motion until seven days&#13;
&#13;
                 after despatch of the motion unless he is notified that the Executive&#13;
&#13;
                 Directors have waived this requirement".         So it is usual.     I have always&#13;
&#13;
                 understood that it was intended to permit of consultation.&#13;
&#13;
GHAIRMAN:        Suppose we put it that a Governor should cast his vote before March 31,&#13;
&#13;
                 without making a statement aa to his not voting before          V~rch   15.&#13;
McLAIN:          1 do not think we should.      I think they should know the requirements of&#13;
&#13;
                 the vote ..&#13;
&#13;
VA:WARESSOS :    All right..   Leave i t:j&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN:        All right..   Now are we prepared to approve the report on the selection of&#13;
&#13;
                 the loth member of the Advisory Council?         You received the report only&#13;
&#13;
                 this morning, but we have had a lot of discussion on the matter, and you&#13;
&#13;
                 are now familiar with it.      Do I hear a motion to adopt the resolution on a&#13;
&#13;
                 vote without meeting and that the report be referred to member countries.&#13;
&#13;
                 Moved by Mr. Yeyer, seconded by Prof. Varvaressos.           Any further discussion?&#13;
&#13;
                 ftJl in favor say aye.      Contrary minded?     It is so ordered.&#13;
&#13;
                  That clears all I have for the formal meeting.           There are a number of things&#13;
&#13;
                  1 'Would like to talk about informally, unless there is something else 1'Ihich&#13;
&#13;
                  any of the Executive Directors might like to talk about on the formal agenda.&#13;
&#13;
                  In the first place, on the proposed penSion plan, it seems as if the action&#13;
                  we took last week did have the desired result.           It brought action immediately&#13;
&#13;
                  on the part of the Fund.      Its Committee has also adopted the plan that we&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  _    '7~~   _&#13;
&amp;#12;~HA:r   PMAN:   had in principle, and although there are some details that they want to&#13;
,Cc       d)&#13;
                discuss further with us, it is naw on their books, and it looks as if we&#13;
&#13;
                can make real progress tOYfards reachine a common plan.   The Flmd Board&#13;
&#13;
                Committee met, according to the note I have, on February 27th, and they&#13;
&#13;
                agreed to the Bank plan in all major points.    That committee directed the&#13;
&#13;
                members of the Fund staff to meet with our representatives to raise the&#13;
&#13;
                points I referred to, and the Fund staff were directed to report back to the&#13;
&#13;
                Fund Board Committee with a view to the preparation of a final    report to the&#13;
&#13;
                Fund Board.   A meeting of the staff of the Fund and the Bank took place on&#13;
&#13;
                March 1st, and the plan 'Which we approved in principle last week, together&#13;
&#13;
                wi th the suggesti ons that were made at last week IS meeti ng, were forwarded&#13;
&#13;
                to the actuary for calculation of cost, and drafting of the formal provisions.&#13;
&#13;
                f!ow we have in more detail what those three points are but I do not think&#13;
&#13;
                it is worth while to discuss them here, in view of the fact that we shall&#13;
&#13;
                have further discussions vd.th the Fund.   We do not quite know what the issues&#13;
&#13;
                will be till they are at that stage.    You have had circulated to you the&#13;
&#13;
                proposed letters we are sending to the Governors regardine    sug~sted   legis-&#13;
&#13;
                 lation to IDake the Bank's bonds legal in various countries.    I urge the&#13;
&#13;
                Directors to do everything they can to press upon their respective countries&#13;
&#13;
                the desirability of adopting such legislation as this.     It would help us&#13;
&#13;
                greatly in the distribution of our securities in this country, if we could&#13;
&#13;
                announce that, and it would seem an entirely reasonable thing to do.       I&#13;
&#13;
                believe I am right, Mr. Black, am 1 not, when I say that that would be of&#13;
&#13;
                considerable importance to us.&#13;
&#13;
BLACK:          I think it would be of great importance.    rie are trying here in each state&#13;
&#13;
                to get legislation, as you know, and sometimes it is quite difficult.          I&#13;
&#13;
                 think that if we get this legislation in the countries that are members of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              - 734 -&#13;
&amp;#12;         the Bank, and announce that we have, it would be roost helpful.&#13;
&#13;
         I have something here that might be of interest.        This is a list of the&#13;
&#13;
         insurance companies that do rosiness in the Philippine Islands.         This brings&#13;
&#13;
         out the point we are talking about.        In one colUllUl is a list of the bonds&#13;
&#13;
         tilat these foreign insurance companies have to buy before tiley can do business&#13;
&#13;
         in the Philippine Islarids.   In most cases these companies have got Philippine&#13;
&#13;
         Government bonds, and U.S. Government bonds.        Now what we want to do is to&#13;
&#13;
         get th3 Philippine Government to make our bonds legal similarly.         We have made&#13;
&#13;
         such requests to legalize our bonds, so that the list of foreign Â·insurance&#13;
&#13;
         companies (they are British, Canadian, Swi ss companies, that do business all&#13;
&#13;
         over the world) may buy tilem.     It is true of a great many countries in the&#13;
&#13;
         insurance business they do in these countries.&#13;
&#13;
3EYEN:   Are we thinking mostly, or entirely, of the case where insurance companies&#13;
&#13;
         working in a foreign country must provide a deposit in local .funds'l        In the&#13;
&#13;
         draft letter we are talking generally about "banks, insurance companies and&#13;
&#13;
         similar institutions" and then asking "in particular" the same cpestion in&#13;
&#13;
         respect of deposits required from foreign insurance companies.&#13;
&#13;
BLACK:   Toore are two answers to that question.        You take any country, like the&#13;
&#13;
         Philippines again.    In the Philippines the.. local insurance companies invest&#13;
&#13;
         a large part of their money in dollar securities.         Therefore it is important&#13;
&#13;
         to us to have our bonds made eligible for the local Philippine insurance&#13;
&#13;
         companies, and it would also cover foreign insurance companies doing business&#13;
&#13;
         in the Philippines.    In tile case of Holland, for example, i l you are talking&#13;
&#13;
         about local insurance companies, it would probably not make any difference&#13;
&#13;
          i.f they were eligible locally or not, but it would make a dif.ference for,&#13;
&#13;
          say, Canadian companies doing business in foreign countries, that is,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                          - 735 -&#13;
&amp;#12;                  insurance companies who had to make deposits against that business for them&#13;
&#13;
                  to be able to buy our bonds.&#13;
&#13;
                  I think we should make it quite clear that both cases are covered.&#13;
&#13;
3LACK:            ~hat   objections would there be if they were not made eligible locally for&#13;
&#13;
                  local insurance companies?&#13;
&#13;
3EYEN :           I think we want to avoid an eva.sive answer, based on exchange regulations,&#13;
&#13;
                  which is really no answer at all.    If we ask for both clearly, it will avoid&#13;
&#13;
                  this possibility_.&#13;
&#13;
;HAIRMA.N :       That might be made clearer in the letter than it is.&#13;
&#13;
! ARV ARESSOS :   I think we must stress the fact that this will be voluntary, and not&#13;
&#13;
                  obligatory.    We do not say they must; they are permitted to_      In some cases&#13;
&#13;
                  I know some legislation where local insurance companies do undertake to&#13;
&#13;
                  insure in foreign exchange.&#13;
&#13;
3LAI..   â&#128;¢        It is purely permissive.&#13;
&#13;
"JARVARESSOS :    It should be permissive.     If we explain that, it   ~~ll   not be necessary to&#13;
&#13;
                  lind t i t to foreign companies, but just to explain that it is permissive&#13;
&#13;
                  legislation which will apply principally to the foreign insurance companies.&#13;
&#13;
                  ! do not think we must just say that local companies are not included.&#13;
&#13;
                  Well, I think we have got that point, and will re-draft the letter to clarify&#13;
&#13;
                  it.&#13;
&#13;
JEYEN :           I think we should make it absolutely clear.&#13;
&#13;
-':HAIPJtJili :   I urge also upon you to think about and to get as quickly as possible to&#13;
&#13;
                  us such items as you consider should go on the agenda for the Advisory&#13;
&#13;
                   Council.   We must begin thinking about that so that we can have it in such&#13;
&#13;
                  a form that we will be able to pass it on to Sir Arthur Salter, and so that&#13;
&#13;
                  we can get some benefit from their discussion.        The sooner I get that the&#13;
&#13;
                   better, because I want to write and tell him about the meeting, and details&#13;
&#13;
                   of the meeting.&#13;
&amp;#12;::::HJ   "{AN:   The Information Bulletin, which you have got has not been marked confidential&#13;
(Co._~    td)&#13;
                 but I want to advise the directors that it is meant only for internal con-&#13;
&#13;
                 sumption.    There may be material that is contained in it that we would not&#13;
&#13;
                 want for one reason or another to be published, or publicly disseminated&#13;
&#13;
                 outside the Bank, but we want to be as informative as possible in it.         I&#13;
&#13;
                 simply give you the warning that there are many itelllB in there which would&#13;
&#13;
                 be inappropriate to, let u.s say, have appear in the press.     I do not think&#13;
&#13;
                 anything has, but one or two comments are in the last one that I     1()   uld have&#13;
&#13;
                 been concerned about if they had reached the public.&#13;
&#13;
VARVARESSOS:     May I ask a question with regard to this publication?      I have seen the first&#13;
&#13;
                 copy that has been distributed, but since then, there have been some modi-&#13;
&#13;
                 fications.     The names of all the authors of articles were mentioned in the&#13;
&#13;
                 first bulletin, am 1 should like to ask if it could again be the custom&#13;
&#13;
                 to name the people who write the articles.      Although the Bank says that an&#13;
&#13;
                 article is not necessarily the Bank I s point of view, I think that i f there&#13;
&#13;
                 is no name or signature to articles, if they are not initialled by people,&#13;
&#13;
                 one might draw the conclusion that they are accepted by the Bank.          I have&#13;
&#13;
                 seen, for example, in some statements on Italy that inflation is aggravated&#13;
&#13;
                 by the fact of unemployment.     Now some people say that unemployment is&#13;
&#13;
                 easing the inflation rather than aggravating it, so I do not want to commit&#13;
&#13;
                 ourselves on anything in the article about Italy.      They say that Italy will&#13;
&#13;
                 not be able to help Europe with the Marshall Plan, but must be helped to&#13;
&#13;
                 develop her economy.     That is not the conception of the Marshall Plan.         Now&#13;
&#13;
                 Ulfe have someone sign this article, we see that it is the personal view of&#13;
&#13;
                  one person, a member of the staff.      Otherwise thereis the danger that the&#13;
&#13;
                  Bank will present the view that our countries must help develop the other&#13;
                  countries in our collaboration with the Marshall Plan which I think is not&#13;
&#13;
                  the policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 131 -&#13;
&amp;#12;               A possible compromise here is that such articles may be signed only by the&#13;
&#13;
               initiator.   It is customary in the Economist also.         A clear si gnature means&#13;
&#13;
               that it is not editorial, but that it is someone else's responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
               Even initials may be of such value.       It is important to determine the real&#13;
&#13;
               author.   This means the institution is not responsible.&#13;
&#13;
VARVARESSOS:   In the Economist the articles are not signed, but then the Economist urxler-&#13;
&#13;
               takes responsibility.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:      There are same articles in the Economist signed by a Special Correspondent,&#13;
&#13;
               or named "By our Own Correspondent", which means something more than Special&#13;
&#13;
               Correspondent.&#13;
&#13;
SUNDARESAN :   As far as this discussion is concerned, all this seems to me important if&#13;
&#13;
               you are going to publish it later.    At the moment, as long asÂ· :it is only&#13;
&#13;
               internal, it seems to me we should not      l'O   rry, because we are not held to&#13;
&#13;
               agree with the views expressed.    I do not know quite why you are worrying&#13;
&#13;
               about it at this juncture.&#13;
&#13;
BEYEN:         And that is apart from the fact that the Bank expressly says that it is not&#13;
&#13;
               responsible.     I do not quite know what we are talking about.        It is stated&#13;
&#13;
               on top of the paper that the Bank is not responsible.&#13;
&#13;
VARVARE5S05:   IDlen the Bank endorses publication, I do not think it is enough to say we&#13;
&#13;
               are not taking any of the responsibility and that the Bank is not responsible.&#13;
&#13;
               Vie do not know when the Bank accepts views arrl when it does not.         I think&#13;
&#13;
               nothing prevents the writers of these articles from initialling them.           It is&#13;
&#13;
               the same procedures as for the old issues; to have articles initialled by&#13;
&#13;
               members of the staff.     I do not see aqy difficulty to that.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIF.liAN :   We had better talk to Woolley about this, because he has been running a check&#13;
&#13;
                on the various comments coming in on this, but I agree with ViI'. Beyen that&#13;
&#13;
               if you have the mast-head that it does not represent the Bankls views as&#13;
&#13;
                such, you are protected.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                               - 738 -&#13;
&amp;#12;'"R,   .Â£SS08 :   Someone must be responsible for the point of view stated; if not the Bank,&#13;
&#13;
                  then someone else is responsible.&#13;
&#13;
ARANSKl:          It is the Reporting Service.&#13;
&#13;
RAIHMAN:          The Heporting Service is responsible for putting the thing together, but not&#13;
&#13;
                  for the content of each article.    It is responsible for the format and&#13;
&#13;
                  presentation.&#13;
&#13;
,RESCIANI:        In any case, it would be useful to show authors, even if articles are for&#13;
&#13;
                  domestic use.   It would increase the responsibility of the author.         other-&#13;
&#13;
                  wise the articles are anonymous.&#13;
&#13;
;1M :IRWlAN :     ite shall probably get more articles written if they are anonymous.         It is&#13;
&#13;
                  easier to get contributions fran    SDme    people if they are anonymous.&#13;
&#13;
3EYEN :           1 do not know whether now- is a good opportunity to express satisfaction by&#13;
&#13;
                  the fact that this Information Bulletin is being circulated.&#13;
&#13;
:HAIRMAN:         I was going to ask what you think about it.&#13;
&#13;
3RESCIANI:        It is very good and very interesting.&#13;
&#13;
3HAIRMAN :        It has been an experiment.     We have made a munber of changes in it, and we&#13;
&#13;
                  only want to do it i f it is worth while.       I hope that as we go along, we&#13;
&#13;
                  can improve it.&#13;
&#13;
BEYEN :           I think it extends also to news on the activities of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:         I spoke already with Mr. Garner about it.        Might it be possible to publish&#13;
&#13;
                  special issues dealing with special countries as a whole?        There are some&#13;
&#13;
                  studies of particular countries.     1'Ie   have seen a good report about Brazil.&#13;
&#13;
                  It may be good to make shorter stuiies am to have special numbers on special&#13;
&#13;
                  issues.&#13;
&#13;
BRESCIANl :       I do not know whether it is possible, as when reports are on the basis of&#13;
&#13;
                  information which has been given by the countries.&#13;
&#13;
BARANSKI:         You might not publish the whole.     Anyhow it is good.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                  - 739 -&#13;
&amp;#12;     .tAN:     We could delete anything confidential.&#13;
&#13;
3ARANSKl :     It is published in the sense of an internal publication.&#13;
&#13;
JARVARESSOS:   Of course the publication is not restricted only to data on facts.        There&#13;
&#13;
               is also the interpretation.     I think it is a great improvement.&#13;
&#13;
~HAIRMAN:      J do not think there is anything I can report on the progress of the European&#13;
&#13;
               Recovery Program that is not already well commented on in the papers.        I&#13;
&#13;
               do not think there are aI'\Y radically new development.   I note the feeling&#13;
&#13;
               that it is going to move with considerable speed in the Senate at least.&#13;
&#13;
               There may be some complexi. ty in the House, but I think the general support&#13;
&#13;
               is really strong.   I went to hear Senator Vandenberg I s speech.    I think he&#13;
&#13;
               made a powerful presentation.     He carries with him a great deal of weight.&#13;
&#13;
               He was listened to very attentively, and the fact that he brought out a&#13;
&#13;
               unanLrnous report indicated that i t vull probably move with considerable&#13;
&#13;
               speed, at least in the Senate.&#13;
&#13;
               J have received an invitation from tt:e President of ilie Republic of Colombia&#13;
&#13;
               to be in Colombia some time during tile course of the cening Bogota Conference.&#13;
&#13;
               J had intended, in any event, to make a trip to S9uth America in the Spring,&#13;
&#13;
               and J accepted that invitation not in any sense as a representative or&#13;
&#13;
               participant in the Bogota Conference.      I thought I would drop in for a few&#13;
&#13;
               days to meet people.   Many of the more important figures of the Latin American&#13;
&#13;
               republics will be there.      It will be an opportunity to meet them, and I would&#13;
&#13;
               then go right on from there to take in my already planned tour.       T   plan to&#13;
&#13;
                ~   to Ecuador, from there to Peru, then to Chile.    I '\\i 11 meet Mr. Moller in&#13;
&#13;
                Chile.   Perhaps Mr. Machado will f!P with me, at least part of the way and&#13;
&#13;
                perhaps to the countries he represents.     In the course of the tour M.r. Moller&#13;
&#13;
                has agreed to go with me to Brazil.      Then I go to Buenos Aires am to Rio,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                - 740-&#13;
&amp;#12;:H  UAN:   perhaps stopping at Uruguay at Montevideo.     I expect to be away most of the&#13;
(Cont'd)&#13;
           month of April and shall probably stop in at Venezuela for a short time&#13;
&#13;
           before returning home.     I look forYlard to this trip.   Vie ha . .re not decided&#13;
&#13;
           yet who will go along, but I would like to have somebody fran the staff of&#13;
&#13;
           tile Bank go with me, someone from the Loan Department, and perhaps one or&#13;
&#13;
           two others.     We have kept acquainted wi. th some of the suggestions that have&#13;
&#13;
           been made in connection with further U.S. aid to the Lati n American countries,&#13;
&#13;
           and the various forms of such aid that have been put fOrYlard, such aS'minor&#13;
&#13;
           to major Marshall plans.     One or two that came forward concerned us ,as being&#13;
&#13;
           in possible conflict with our objectives, or as confusing or complicating&#13;
&#13;
           our position.     I hope that the representations we have been able to make&#13;
&#13;
           have caused elimination or partial elimination.      There is nothing of any&#13;
&#13;
           definite character that I know of that has yet been formulated.          I feel sure&#13;
&#13;
           we rill be kept advised and I really believe that nothing will transpire&#13;
&#13;
           there which would interfere with the interests of the Bank.         On the other&#13;
&#13;
           hand, from the point of view of the Bank, we have already impressed on the&#13;
&#13;
           U.S. Government that everything we can do to cooperate with anw objectives&#13;
&#13;
           they have in mind we would be very glad to do.      Mr. Iliff, have anything to&#13;
&#13;
           report on loans?&#13;
&#13;
ILIFF:     There is not much to report to the Board this week.        I mentioned last week&#13;
&#13;
           that we were conSidering sending a small Bank mission to Belgi llm.         \'Ie have&#13;
&#13;
           now decided to do so, and the mission will leave this week.         It will consist&#13;
&#13;
           of Mr. Penton, of the Loan Department, ltir. Rembert, of the Research Iepart-&#13;
&#13;
           ment, and Mr. laterston, of the Loan Department.       Their purpose is to give&#13;
&#13;
            information that the Belgian Government may require about the kind of&#13;
&#13;
            projects that may be regarded by the Bank as suitable for financing.           There&#13;
&#13;
            is no question or their entering into loan negotiations with the Belgian&#13;
&#13;
            Government at this stage.     Secondly, they will complete a brief study which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                              _.-&#13;
&amp;#12;ILFF:     has already been begun of the various aspects of thf3 Belgian economy.     We&#13;
(C  Id)&#13;
          have also last week despatched a mission to Peru at the request of the&#13;
&#13;
          Peruvian Government, with no other tems of reference than to enter into&#13;
&#13;
          general discussions with the Peruvian Government and to indicate to them the&#13;
&#13;
          sources frem which they might be able to obtain expert and technical advice&#13;
&#13;
          on schemes of development that they themselves are contemplating.    The&#13;
&#13;
          Bolivian Government had also asked us to send a mission to them, and we have&#13;
&#13;
          taken the opportunity of the despatch of this mission to Peru to send them&#13;
&#13;
          across the Continent to look in at Bolivia before they return to Washington.&#13;
&#13;
          I mentioned last week the question of the mission that we had already decided&#13;
&#13;
          to serd to Czechoslovakia.   The date for the arrival of that mission in&#13;
&#13;
          Prague was the 12th of March, and the Board will remember that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
          informed the Czechoslovak Embassy here that while we would still hope to&#13;
&#13;
          work ta.vards that 12th of March date, we would prefer not to send a mission&#13;
&#13;
          away from Washington until we saw how the situation was developing.       Yester-&#13;
&#13;
          day I asked the Czechoslovak Minister to call, and I informed him that while&#13;
&#13;
          in principle the Bank was still willing, and indeed anxious, to send a&#13;
&#13;
          mission to Czechoslovakia, we   thou~t   that we still ought to consider the&#13;
&#13;
          timing of the mission 1 s despatch fran here and its arrival in Prague.     I&#13;
&#13;
          said that there were two points that arose.    First of all, we should like&#13;
&#13;
          a little more time to elapse in order to give the local situation in&#13;
&#13;
          Czechoslovakia a little further time to settle dovm in order that the Bank&#13;
&#13;
          mission could operate under the best possible conditions; and setondly, we&#13;
&#13;
          thought it was perhaps desirable that the U.S. press mould be given a few&#13;
&#13;
          days or weeks to settle dmm and relegate Czecooslovakia to the fifth or&#13;
&#13;
           sixth page instead of the front page news.    I suggested to Hr. Hanc that&#13;
&#13;
           I should gp and see him again in three weeks I time ard discuss the possibi-&#13;
&#13;
           lity of being able to despatch the mission pretty well at once.    The only&#13;
&amp;#12; ,&#13;
&#13;
1L Tl&lt;'p :         other point that I wi sh to mention is the Brazilian negotiations.     We have&#13;
(C     ,'d)&#13;
                   informed the Brazilian Government, or the Brazilian representative, who&#13;
&#13;
                   is negotiating with us here, that the Bank vrill require in the case of a&#13;
&#13;
                   loan to Brazil a negative pledge clause from the Brazilian Government in&#13;
&#13;
                   the usual terms we require from aI13' other goverrunent or country.   He has&#13;
&#13;
                   told us that under his present instructioIlB from his (kJvernment he is not&#13;
&#13;
                   authorized to enter into an agreement that includes a negative pledge clause.&#13;
&#13;
                   He has telegraphed his government for further instructions.      \7e are awaiting&#13;
&#13;
                   a reply from Rio.&#13;
&#13;
CHAIRMAN :          Are there any other matters that al1\Yone has on his mind, or any comments?&#13;
&#13;
                    If not, the next meeting will be at the usual time and place.&#13;
