            Privatizing airports - options and case studies
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Traditionally, the air transport
            sector--airlines, airports, and air navigation services--has
            been in state hands.  The private sector became involved in
            the sector only recently, beginning with the airlines.
            Privatization of airport infrastructure and private sector
            participation in air navigation are also at an early stage.
            The air transport sector will require large capital
            investments over the next fifteen years to modernize
            aircraft fleets, improve airport infrastructure, introduce
            more sophisticated air navigation systems, and meet the
            demand of new markets.  There is no doubt that governments
            will be unable to fund all necessary investments, and that
            the private sector will therefore play an increasing role in
            meeting the sector's needs.  Table 1 in this Note
            presents three options of private sector participation in
            airports.  Table 2 presents two options most suitable for
            transferring airport activities to the private sector.  The
            Note also outlines cases of airport privatization in
            Colombia, Jamaica, Canada, and Northern Ireland.
