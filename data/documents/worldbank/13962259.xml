&amp;#12;ABOUT THIS REPORT&#13;
The IFC Annual Report continues an approach we pioneered&#13;
last year, combining information on our investments and&#13;
advisory services, sustainability, development effectiveness,&#13;
and donor partnerships. The report covers fiscal 2008 (July&#13;
1, 2007, through June 30, 2008) and discusses the year's&#13;
new business as well as the performance and development&#13;
results of our portfolio.&#13;
    Our goal is to provide a full picture of what IFC does&#13;
and how we are performing. We seek to enhance our&#13;
accountability and to articulate our vision, core corporate&#13;
values, purpose, and the way we work for a wide range of&#13;
stakeholders: client companies, governments, partners, local&#13;
communities affected by our activities, advocacy organiza-&#13;
tions, investors, and our staff.&#13;
    The report's Web site, www.ifc.org/annualreport,&#13;
provides several components of our reporting: the fiscal 2008&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT&#13;
2008 has been an important year for the World Bank Group ­ a year of challenges and oppor-&#13;
tunities. IFC has played a critical role in addressing both. I am pleased to introduce a report that&#13;
captures IFC's achievements and outlines the work ahead.&#13;
      This year, the Bank Group has developed six strategic priorities to focus our attention,&#13;
emphasizing the poorest countries, particularly those in Africa; fragile and post-conflict states;&#13;
middle-income countries; global and regional public goods; expanding opportunity for the&#13;
Arab world; and knowledge and learning.&#13;
      IFC is carrying out these initiatives with energy, commitment, and creativity. To catalyze&#13;
investment in Africa and other frontier markets, IFC is working to make it easier for sovereign&#13;
wealth funds to invest equity in these markets. To ease the food crisis, IFC has invested in agri-&#13;
business companies, helping them expand production and mitigate risks. To help firms move&#13;
to cleaner and more efficient technologies, IFC has developed an innovative carbon delivery&#13;
guarantee that helps companies in developing countries sell carbon credits to buyers in the de-&#13;
veloped world. To address the growing needs for infrastructure in developing countries, IFC is&#13;
scaling up investments in transportation, power, and utility projects, and applying best-practice&#13;
approaches to environmental and social issues.&#13;
      I have seen first-hand how the Bank Group can tackle pressing development challenges in the poorest countries by bringing to&#13;
bear its multiple areas of expertise, products, and services. During a trip to Mozambique this year, I visited the Southern Africa Regional&#13;
Gas project, which is financed by IBRD, IFC, and MIGA. The project is enabling the country to monetize its natural gas resources by&#13;
linking up with the South African export market. IFC and IDA, moreover, have cooperated on a groundbreaking risk-sharing initiative in&#13;
Madagascar that is increasing the availability of loans for small and medium enterprises. Increasing this kind of cooperation will allow&#13;
us to reach further with a blend of services.&#13;
      IFC's investments and advice are an essential part of the Bank Group's help to middle-income countries. Despite overall progress,&#13;
these countries are still the home to many poor people, and their companies and markets still face capital constraints. Governments&#13;
also need help to bring in more investment and share the benefits of growth with more people and places. IFC gets involved where&#13;
it can make a difference, not only bringing in private capital but also helping private enterprises meet global corporate governance&#13;
standards, safeguard the environment, and integrate local communities into their supply chains through linkages programs with large&#13;
companies. In addition, IFC clients are promoting development across national boundaries, in the form of South-South investments.&#13;
      The contribution to private sector development is far-reaching. In Liberia and other post-conflict countries, IFC is working on&#13;
facilitating business-climate reforms and strengthening the financial sector. In Africa, IFC is working with its partners to mobilize up to&#13;
$1 billion to support the development of a socially responsible private health sector. In the Middle East, IFC is helping local banks make&#13;
student loans more widely available. IFC's global trade finance initiative has been lending critical support to trade flows with the emerg-&#13;
ing markets and has served as a stabilizing presence in times of credit or liquidity constraints. IFC also has recognized the enormous&#13;
economic and social potential represented by women entrepreneurs in developing countries, and its gender program has introduced&#13;
successful initiatives to promote women-owned businesses.&#13;
      IFC is well suited to the tasks ahead. It has the right mix of capital and expertise. There is strong demand for its services throughout&#13;
the developing world: private initiative is increasingly recognized as an effective and innovative engine of economic growth. When sup-&#13;
ported by sound public policies, it has unparalleled power to boost local economies, create jobs, and unearth opportunities that create&#13;
pathways to inclusive and sustainable development. IFC, with its unique private sector experience and know-how, has the innovative&#13;
spirit and results-oriented culture that are needed to make a difference.&#13;
      I want to thank the dedicated and highly accomplished staff at IFC for their commitment to transforming us into a more dynam-&#13;
ic, flexible, and innovative institution. Whenever I attend a briefing at IFC, I leave with optimism about the ingenuity and drive of the&#13;
IFC staff to empower the private sector in developing countries to improve lives and livelihoods. The accomplishments and spirit of&#13;
IFC are also a testament to the strong and effective leadership of Lars Thunell, who guides an excellent team with judgment, experi-&#13;
ence, and a drive for results. I also thank our Board of Directors, the Governors, and our many contributors and partners, without&#13;
whom we could not be successful.&#13;

&amp;#12;CREATING OPPORTUNITY&#13;
In developing and transition countries around the world, as many&#13;
as 2.6 billion people live on less than $2 a day. Economic growth&#13;
at the national level, often strong in recent years, has barely&#13;
altered the circumstances they face. Most of these people have no&#13;
bank accounts, and many lack telephones. Access to clean water,&#13;
electricity, and basic health care remains unattainable for many.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Their plight illustrates the uneven progress of the global&#13;
drive to reduce poverty. Regional disparities abound: the&#13;
number of impoverished people has dropped sharply in&#13;
East Asia but climbed in Sub-Saharan Africa. Even in the&#13;
more prosperous middle-income countries, more than a&#13;
billion people still live on the economic fringes, struggling&#13;
for basic necessities.&#13;
     IFC aims to help people at the bottom of the&#13;
economic pyramid. We recognize that they constitute&#13;
an important, often untapped market and that a strong,&#13;
sustainable private sector can play a critical role in&#13;
improving their lives. Our investments and advice also help&#13;
tackle the social and environmental problems that impose&#13;
a particularly high burden on the poor. IFC's activities are&#13;
guided by five strategic principles...&#13;

Strengthening the Focus on Frontier Markets&#13;
IFC goes where we are needed most, reaching the underserved wherever they are--in the poorest&#13;
countries, in the poorer regions of middle-income countries, and in industry sectors that have the&#13;
broadest potential to spur development and improve lives. Our priorities in these areas--the frontier&#13;
markets--include strengthening small and medium enterprises; intensifying our effort to promote&#13;
agribusiness; devising innovative solutions to revive the private sector in conflict-affected countries; and&#13;
stepping up our collaboration with other World Bank Group entities to serve the poorest countries.&#13;

Promoting Private Sector Growth in&#13;
Infrastructure, Health, and Education&#13;
Economic growth is easier to achieve when people's basic needs--energy, transportation,&#13;
housing, access to clean water--are met. It occurs faster when people have good access to&#13;
education and health care. But governments in many developing countries invest far less than&#13;
they need to in infrastructure, education, and health care, while private investors could do more&#13;
to help fill the gap. IFC helps increase access to basic services by financing landmark infrastructure&#13;
projects; expanding investment and advisory services in the health and education sectors; and&#13;
collaborating across the World Bank Group to maximize our development impact.&#13;

Developing Local Financial Markets&#13;
A shortage of sophisticated financial services presents a key obstacle to people and private&#13;
enterprises in many developing countries. Businesses, both large and small, are often denied&#13;
loans because they are considered a poor credit risk. IFC has made it a priority to broaden&#13;
access to finance and deepen capital markets by expanding the availability of microfinance and&#13;
credit for small and medium enterprises; introducing new products that help lower financial&#13;
risks, especially through local currency financing; and mobilizing finance from international&#13;
banks and other investors.&#13;

&amp;#12;WHERE WE WORK&#13;
IFC helps the private sector do its part to create opportunity&#13;
and improve lives in emerging markets around the world.&#13;
k In the poorest countries, we work with a wide array of&#13;
  partners to provide the advisory services and financing that&#13;
  allow private enterprises to develop and grow.&#13;
k In middle-income countries, where the majority of the&#13;
  world's poor people live, we help the private sector extend its&#13;
  reach to people and regions that have not yet shared in the&#13;
  benefits of economic growth.&#13;
k In all developing markets we help companies and financial&#13;
  institutions raise operating standards, improve their sustain-&#13;
  ability, and become more globally competitive.&#13;

DEEPENING IFC'S PARTNERSHIP WITH IDA&#13;
IFC has stepped up cooperation with the International Devel-&#13;
opment Association, the World Bank Group's lead agency for&#13;
assisting the world's poorest countries, which together with&#13;
the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development&#13;
forms the World Bank. During FY08 we began a net transfer&#13;
of $1.75 billion to IDA's current three-year funding cycle;&#13;
IFC's funding matches IBRD's contribution for the first time.&#13;
Our greater stake in IDA reflects growing awareness of the&#13;
role the private sector plays in helping the poorest countries&#13;
reduce poverty and improve people's lives--and recognition&#13;
that IFC is uniquely positioned to galvanize private investors&#13;
in these markets. While IDA will continue to focus primarily&#13;
on public sector projects, a new IDA/IFC Secretariat has been&#13;
created to pursue opportunities for increasing joint Bank&#13;
Group efforts that support private sector development in the&#13;
countries IDA serves.&#13;
    Joint projects typically involve an IDA credit or guarantee,       CONNECTING MORE PEOPLE TO&#13;

&amp;#12;WHAT WE DO:&#13;
IFC'S OPERATIONS AND RESULTS&#13;
IFC provides a unique combination of investment and advisory&#13;
services to promote the sustainable growth of private enterprises&#13;
in emerging markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                            In developing countries, the essential ingredients for private&#13;
                            entrepreneurship are often missing. Commercial banks are unable to&#13;
                            provide long-term financing to local businesses. Financing dries up entirely&#13;
                            in times of national crisis. Businesses lack crucial technical know-how.&#13;
                                 IFC delivers what cannot be obtained elsewhere. We offer clients&#13;
                            a unique package of products and services aimed at helping local&#13;
                            businesses grow quickly and sustainably. We call that special edge our&#13;
                           "additionality." It is both the foundation of our decision-making and a key&#13;
                            reason that clients choose to work with us.&#13;
                                 We provide local currency loans at maturities that otherwise would&#13;
                            be unavailable. We provide long-term financing, including equity, even&#13;
                            in crisis situations. We make additional funds available by arranging loan&#13;
                            syndications and structured finance transactions.&#13;
                                 We transfer global expertise to our clients, providing advice that makes&#13;
                            them more competitive and steadily improves their business practices. We&#13;
                            help create a friendly climate for entrepreneurship by working with the&#13;
                            World Bank to advise governments on regulatory reforms.&#13;
                                 Our distinguishing trait, ultimately, is the way we measure our own&#13;
                            performance--by the tangible ways we improve the lives of people in our&#13;
                            client countries.&#13;

                                                   looks at her teenage son, she sees the future. "The&#13;

                                                   "That's why I do all I can for him to finish his profession-&#13;
                                                   al studies." In Mexico, people with university degrees&#13;
                                                   usually earn at least twice as much as those without.&#13;

    LOCAL CURRENCY FINANCING&#13;
    IFC uses local currency financing to help clients mitigate foreign         while the disbursed equity portfolio grew by 46 percent.&#13;
    exchange risk and to develop local capital markets. Including equity,&#13;
    IFC provided about a third of our financing and investment in local&#13;
    currency during FY08. Using market-based instruments, IFC provides&#13;
    local currency debt financing in several forms: loans, risk management&#13;
    swaps that allow clients to hedge foreign currency liabilities back into&#13;
    local currency, and credit enhancement structures that enable clients&#13;
    to borrow in local currency from other sources.&#13;
           IFC has committed more than $5 billion equivalent in local cur-&#13;
    rency using derivatives, for 170 investments in 23 currencies. This form&#13;
    of financing uses long-term derivatives markets, and IFC works closely&#13;
    with market counterparts and government regulators to extend the&#13;
    availability and liquidity of these markets. In FY08, IFC committed its&#13;
    first local currency loans in Argentina, Costa Rica, Ghana, Guatemala,&#13;
    Kenya, and Zambia, and we were particularly active in providing&#13;
    financing in Brazilian reais, Russian rubles, and South African rand.&#13;
           IFC is at the forefront of domestic capital market development.&#13;
    Through participation in the structuring and credit enhancement of&#13;
    transactions, IFC has helped introduce new asset classes. Transactions&#13;
    have not only enabled IFC's clients to secure attractive long-term local&#13;
    currency financing, but have also been catalysts in expanding numer-&#13;
    ous domestic markets. Since 2001, IFC has completed 79 domestic&#13;
    market structured transactions in 25 currencies for an exposure of&#13;
    $1.04 billion equivalent; we have assisted in mobilizing more than&#13;
    $4.5 billion equivalent.&#13;

    We worked in new markets, including Bangladesh, Leba-&#13;
non, Rwanda, Tunisia, the United Arab Emirates, and the&#13;
West Bank and Gaza, as well as with repeat and new clients&#13;
in established markets. IFC has evolved as a leading innovator,&#13;
meeting client needs and promoting development of domestic&#13;
credit markets. Through these products, IFC provides financing&#13;
in underserved markets and priority sectors and mobilizes long-&#13;
term local currency financing. This year in the Middle East, for&#13;
example, we created a novel risk-sharing facility that expanded&#13;
SMEs' access to finance and supported the sector's recovery&#13;
from the conflict in Lebanon, helped students access loans&#13;
through an innovative risk-sharing facility in the West Bank and&#13;
Gaza, and merged Islamic and modern finance to achieve the&#13;
first Sharia-compliant securitization of mortgages in the Persian&#13;
Gulf region.&#13;

TRADE FINANCE&#13;
The IFC Global Trade Finance Program extends and comple-&#13;
ments banks' capacity to deliver trade financing by providing&#13;
risk mitigation in challenging markets. During FY08, IFC issued&#13;
over $1.4 billion in guarantees to support more than 2,000&#13;
individual trade transactions. We have issued $2.5 billion worth&#13;
of guarantees for more than 3,000 individual transactions since&#13;
the program began in 2005. We now provide risk coverage for&#13;
122 banks across 61 countries and territories, including Burundi,&#13;
Gambia, Nepal, Nicaragua, Tajikistan, and the West Bank and&#13;
Gaza. IDA countries--most of them in Africa--accounted              IFC'S CARBON DELIVERY GUARANTEE: A NEW&#13;
for 51 percent of the total volume of guarantees issued in          PRODUCT FOR CLIMATE-FRIENDLY INVESTMENT&#13;

    IFC's paid-in capital, retained earnings, and general loan&#13;

capital serves to support the existing business, accommodate&#13;
medium-term growth opportunities and strategic plans, and&#13;
provide a buffer to withstand shocks or crises in some client&#13;
countries or more general market downturns, while retaining&#13;
capacity to preserve our triple-A rating and play a countercycli-&#13;

    IFC's current and projected capacity over the medium term&#13;
is considered adequate for these purposes.&#13;

&amp;#12;CONNECTING THE DOTS&#13;
WHO BENEFITS FROM IFC PROJECTS AND HOW&#13;
IFC-supported firms make a wide range of contributions in developing countries. Their growth and success benefit employees and&#13;
their families, local communities, suppliers and other business partners, and the customers who buy what they produce. These firms&#13;
also generate significant tax revenues for national and local governments. In many cases they are using IFC's funding and advice to&#13;
upgrade environmental performance, strengthen corporate governance, and improve their management systems and adherence to&#13;
industry standards. Often these firms help broadly stimulate the private sector, benefiting competitors and new entrants as well.&#13;
   For most IFC investments (84 percent), benefits to society exceeded profits to the financiers. In fact, we analyzed a representa-&#13;
tive sample of 63 projects, and for every dollar of project costs (in total $7.75 billion, of which IFC had financed 13 percent), our&#13;
clients generated almost a full extra dollar (about 88 cents) in value added over and above the costs--and these benefits were&#13;
evenly split between investors and other stakeholders. We hope that the projects IFC approved this fiscal year--with total project&#13;
costs of $43 billion--will show similarly strong results.&#13;

&amp;#12;REGIONAL OPERATIONS&#13;
AND RESULTS&#13;
IFC's global expertise allows us to strengthen private enterprises&#13;
and improve the climate for entrepreneurship in emerging markets,&#13;
focusing where the needs are most pressing.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC provides investment and advisory services to clients in 130 countries, including a growing&#13;
number of the least developed countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. More than 40 percent of our&#13;
projects are in the poorest countries--those served by the World Bank's International Development&#13;
Association. We also operate in middle-income countries, aiming to reach many of their people&#13;
who still live on the economic margins.&#13;
     We have transformed IFC to meet our clients' changing needs, moving a growing number of staff&#13;
to field offices nearer our clients. More than half our staff are based in field offices in 81 countries, up&#13;
from 41 percent five years ago. We pursue opportunities where we can make the biggest difference,&#13;
including in higher-risk emerging markets. Our approach has helped us achieve strong development&#13;
results as well as profitability--income that lets us reinvest where the needs are greatest.&#13;
     In fiscal 2008, Latin America and the Caribbean accounted for the largest share of IFC&#13;
commitments for our own account--26 percent. Our advisory services also continued to grow&#13;
throughout the developing regions, with the largest project expenditures going to Europe and&#13;
Central Asia and to Sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;

A new chapter in Africa's development is being written. Fewer conflicts, expanding trade, and growing investments are helping&#13;
reduce poverty and raise living standards. Pockets of conflict and instability remain, but peaceful resolution of disputes and sound&#13;
macroeconomic policies are emerging. The result is strong growth--6.1 percent in 2007--with manageable levels of inflation and&#13;
progress on budget deficits and foreign debt payments across the region. Many nations have begun to make slow, steady progress&#13;
toward a better investment climate. Nonetheless, the region remains a challenge for IFC, requiring a focused strategy and devotion&#13;
of significant resources. IFC has made that commitment, and we have begun to achieve significant results.&#13;

Developing countries in East Asia and the Pacific grew by an average of 10 percent in 2007, consolidating the region's role as an&#13;
anchor for economic growth. The benefits have not been fully shared, however, and over half a billion people still live on less than&#13;
$2 a day. Poorer countries and lagging regions of larger countries, some affected by recent conflict, need a sustained commitment to&#13;
upgrade infrastructure and create an enabling environment for a growing private sector. With two of the world's top three countries&#13;
for greenhouse gas emissions--China and Indonesia--the region is contributing to climate change pressures that have consequences&#13;
for the planet as a whole. During the fiscal year, the region faced many challenges, including macroeconomic instability, particularly&#13;
in Vietnam, and a devastating earthquake in China.&#13;

South Asia is home to more poor people than any other region: more than a billion people here live on less than $2 a day. While&#13;
economic growth has been strong, averaging 8.1 percent a year across the region over the last three years, inequality has been&#13;
rising. India, in particular, presents a complex challenge. Large sections of the population, particularly in rural areas, remain&#13;
untouched by the benefits of growth; 31 of India's 35 states and territories have incomes comparable to those of IDA countries.&#13;
To distribute benefits more evenly, the region's infrastructure development and rural growth--including job creation--are urgent&#13;
priorities. Climate change, which disproportionately affects the poor, is a particularly pressing challenge.&#13;

Europe and Central Asia remains one of the world's fastest-growing regions, with 8.2 percent GDP growth in 2007. Strong exports,&#13;
closer integration with global markets, better access to credit, and high commodity prices are among the drivers. These same forces&#13;
have made the region's countries vulnerable to recent turmoil in financial markets, and the global credit crunch increased demand for&#13;
IFC financing across the region during FY08. The region also has rising inflation, fueled by higher global prices for food and energy&#13;
and greater government spending. Challenges to private sector development include outdated infrastructure, persistent financial&#13;
market weaknesses, cumbersome regulatory regimes, and weak institutions. Because the region accounts for a significant share of&#13;
global carbon emissions, improving its energy efficiency is also a priority.&#13;

The region has grown, with low inflation, for a fifth consecutive year, although this growth has lagged behind that of other emerging&#13;
market regions. The economy has been bolstered by sound macroeconomic policies, high prices for export commodities, and strong&#13;
growth in trade. In many countries, domestic demand stimulates growth, and both investment and private credit have expanded.&#13;
Despite macroeconomic stability, however, poverty and inequality persist, giving rise to social and political tensions in some&#13;
countries. The region also lags behind other emerging regions in its competitiveness. Crucial reforms in the pension, labor, fiscal,&#13;
infrastructure, and financial sectors are needed to sustain its growth.&#13;

                smaller countries, especially IDA countries; this includes a strategic approach   of these in Bolivia, Honduras, and Nicaragua. These efforts are encouraging&#13;
                in the Caribbean islands, which have some of the world's highest income           registration of new small businesses, creating opportunities and reducing the informal&#13;

The region's economies continue to perform relatively well amid the global financial turmoil and economic slowdown. GDP growth&#13;
estimates for 2008 remain at about 6 percent. Liquidity also remains satisfactory. While inflationary pressures have emerged in the&#13;
region along with the increase in world prices for food and other commodities, most countries have maintained macroeconomic&#13;
stability. Despite overall strong performance, however, many countries face challenges of high unemployment (especially among youth),&#13;
conflict and political instability, limited access to finance (especially for poor people, women entrepreneurs, and smaller businesses),&#13;
inadequate physical and financial infrastructure, and weak legal and regulatory frameworks for private sector development.&#13;

                                        We provide global expertise across the spectrum of economic&#13;
                                        activities that make for a robust private sector--from&#13;
                                        agribusiness to finance; from manufacturing and services to&#13;
                                        information technology; and from health and education to&#13;
                                        infrastructure. We help our clients raise their standards to&#13;
                                        become more competitive and sustainable.&#13;
                                            In fiscal year 2008, IFC's industry operations allowed us&#13;
                                        to play a role in alleviating the global food crisis--we helped&#13;
                                        many agribusiness firms get food to world markets. We are&#13;
                                        leading the way in encouraging sovereign wealth funds to&#13;
                                        invest directly in Sub-Saharan Africa. Amid the global credit&#13;
                                        crunch, we improved prospects for private enterprises in&#13;
                                        developing countries by increasing the amount of local&#13;
                                        currency financing we provide.&#13;
                                            Our investments in global financial markets totaled $4.6&#13;
                                        billion in FY08, accounting for 40 percent of our activities.&#13;
                                        IFC investments in infrastructure reached $2.4 billion,&#13;
                                        increasing substantially to 21 percent from 11 percent the&#13;

Financial market development is critical to reducing poverty and improving lives. Sound and efficient financial markets can ensure that&#13;
resources are allocated where they are most productive, creating jobs and spurring economic growth. IFC places a priority on investment&#13;
in the financial sector because it underpins development in all other sectors; it accounts for about 40 percent of IFC's new commitments&#13;
and investments each year. In FY08, financial market instability and higher interest rates slowed global growth and lessened access to&#13;
finance. Tightening credit conditions also present challenges in many markets in which IFC operates. The effect of the credit crunch is&#13;
being closely monitored, and the financial markets strategy may be adjusted to address related challenges.&#13;

Private equity has become a recognized asset class among private sector companies, institutional investors, and capital markets focusing&#13;
on developing countries. Fund managers add value to portfolio companies in far-reaching ways, such as improved technology and&#13;
operations, up-to-date accounting methods and systems, better and more frequent reporting, and better corporate governance. All of&#13;
these value additions translate into stronger, faster-growing companies that are able to generate more and better jobs, pay more taxes,&#13;
and be better corporate citizens. Private equity funds also play an important role in deepening capital markets, as they provide otherwise&#13;
unavailable risk financing and often enable companies to broaden their shareholder base and even list on local stock exchanges.&#13;

Information and communication technologies are critical catalysts of development. They help communities and local businesses access&#13;
information and services and facilitate rural and local market integration with the global economy. There is growing evidence that these&#13;
technologies contribute to economic growth and poverty reduction. A study on the impact of mobile phones in developing countries&#13;
has shown that a 10 percent increase in telephone usage can lead to a direct GDP gain of 0.6 percent and a larger indirect gain. As the&#13;
biggest global platform, with over 3.5 billion users, mobile phones also offer unprecedented opportunities for extending health, education,&#13;
financial, and other basic services to underserved people. Investments in mobile telephony over the last decade have been significant, with&#13;
75 percent of the world's people now covered, although much remains to be done to extend access to rural and less developed areas.&#13;

Infrastructure is basic to economic growth, better living standards, and broader development. Its catalytic role in poverty reduction&#13;
has been widely recognized, yet it remains inadequate in many developing countries. Transport infrastructure (roads, ports, railways,&#13;
airports) and services (shipping, airlines, logistics) are necessary for domestic and international trade. The World Bank estimates that&#13;
infrastructure investment needs in developing countries amount to about $400 billion a year, but only about half that amount is&#13;
being spent. These figures are well beyond what the public sector alone can meet. Engagements in poorer countries also have long&#13;
lead times and require time-intensive structuring. Infrastructure sectors also need efficient management, which is often lacking.&#13;

High commodity prices are substantially increasing revenue, through taxes and profit shares, for governments in mineral-rich&#13;
developing countries; these funds offer them the opportunity for greater spending on development. The key is the management of&#13;
these flows, to ensure that the revenues are well spent for the benefit of local communities. For poorer developing countries that&#13;
are not commodity exporters, on the other hand, the current high oil prices are an added cost that could slow their growth and may&#13;
also have more direct poverty impacts. Concerns about climate change have also deepened, presenting challenges to improve the&#13;
efficiency of energy use in production and processing.&#13;

In many developing countries, local and regional authorities are being entrusted to provide more infrastructure services, including&#13;
water and sanitation, waste disposal, energy, and transportation. As local governments become more self-reliant, they increasingly&#13;
seek financing from commercial sources. Likewise, nationally owned enterprises that deliver key infrastructure services are increasingly&#13;
expected to operate commercially, at arm's length from government regulators, and to raise financing on their own credit. As part of the&#13;
World Bank Group's strategy for middle-income countries, IFC and IBRD in FY07 launched a joint subnational finance initiative to help&#13;
local governments and public utilities improve their creditworthiness and access financing for essential infrastructure.&#13;

DEVELOPMENT RESULTS&#13;
Subnational finance is a relatively new line of business for IFC; most operations are&#13;
not yet sufficiently mature to evaluate results fully. The Bus Rapid Transit system in&#13;
Guatemala City has reduced commuting times and increased the availability and&#13;
safety of public transportation, benefiting about 150,000 passengers per day. The&#13;

Agribusiness comprises many functions in the food supply chain for domestic and international markets: production, marketing,&#13;
logistics, processing, and distribution. Most of the world's poor live in rural areas and are directly involved in agriculture, which&#13;
accounts for 34 percent of GDP and employs 64 percent of workers, on average, in the least developed countries. The demand for&#13;
food and agricultural products in developing countries is increasing along with population growth and better living standards, even&#13;
as high energy prices drive up the demand for biomass and biofuel feedstocks. Food price increases in 2007 and 2008 underline the&#13;
magnitude of the challenge for agribusiness to satisfy an increasing demand for food while safeguarding natural resources.&#13;
&#13;

Manufacturing and services account for 40 percent of developing countries' GDP and receive about 40 percent of total foreign direct&#13;
investment. The sector is growing at about 9 percent a year, three times the rate in high-income countries. Driven by GDP and income&#13;
growth, the demand for manufacturing and services in developing countries has risen significantly. Within this arena, IFC focuses on&#13;
key industries that form the foundation of sustainable growth and that provide affordable goods and services to consumers, create&#13;
jobs, contribute to government revenue, and stimulate the growth of local small and medium enterprises. These sectors include&#13;
construction materials, retail, tourism, and property, which support infrastructure development; pharmaceuticals, as part of ensuring&#13;
affordable health care; and forest products and energy-efficient machinery, to help address the impact of climate change.&#13;

The private health and education sectors continue to grow in most emerging markets, providing services to people from all&#13;
income groups that complement those offered by public systems. Governments increasingly support private provision of health&#13;
and education services along with improved regulations, better licensing and quality controls, and more reliance on public-&#13;
private partnerships. Growth and change also stem from technological innovation, a more commercial focus in these sectors, and&#13;
globalization, with more providers expanding operations across borders. Health and education are increasingly seen as productive&#13;
economic sectors that provide jobs for skilled and unskilled workers, tax revenue for governments, and essential infrastructure to&#13;
support economic development.&#13;

                      payments deferred until the student enters the&#13;

                      repay loans. The facility is expected to serve&#13;
                      about 2,400 students and extend up to $16.9&#13;

&amp;#12;ADVISORY SERVICES&#13;
OPERATIONS AND RESULTS&#13;
IFC paves the way for sustainable development by&#13;
advising businesses and governments on how to&#13;
remove obstacles to private enterprise and improve&#13;
business standards in emerging markets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC's advisory operations constitute one of our fastest-growing businesses. In&#13;
FY08, we approved 299 advisory services projects in 75 countries. This funding,&#13;
in which is IFC is joined by an array of donor partners, represents an increase of&#13;
more than 50 percent over FY07.&#13;
     IFC is addressing a strong appetite in developing countries for advice on&#13;
how to build a robust private sector. Our advisory work is a unique competitive&#13;
advantage for IFC--no other multilateral financial institution offers client&#13;
companies such a range of financing and business advice. We also advise&#13;
governments on how to spur development through partnerships between the&#13;
public and private sectors.&#13;
     IFC increasingly integrates advisory services with investments. The work&#13;
includes advising national and local governments on how to improve the&#13;
investment climate, strengthen basic infrastructure, and raise social and&#13;
environmental standards. We also help investment clients sharpen their&#13;
competitive edge, improve corporate governance, and become more sustainable.&#13;
     In FY08, IFC had advisory projects in 29 conflict-affected countries. Because&#13;
such countries often seem too risky for private investors, our advisory work plays&#13;
an important role in laying the foundation for future investment.&#13;

&amp;#12;WORKING WITH PARTNERS&#13;
IFC's success in fostering private sector development&#13;
reflects our many innovative partnerships with&#13;
governments, foundations, and civil society.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC maximizes the results we can produce by collaborating with others who share our&#13;
objectives. Collaboration helps us achieve what we could not on our own. It allows us to&#13;
pool our resources and capitalize on the competitive advantages of each of our partners. It&#13;
lets us share knowledge and helps improve the design and implementation of programs.&#13;
    In FY08, we teamed with a range of partners to tackle the highest-priority challenges&#13;
on the development agenda--including the food crisis, climate change, and aid to conflict-&#13;
affected countries. Our donor partners helped finance the expansion of IFC's advisory&#13;
operations, making a record $211 million contribution.&#13;
    Corporate philanthropies and foundations also increased their contributions to this&#13;
work, accounting for 5 percent of all donor contributions to IFC's advisory work. And&#13;
we continued to build our cooperation with financial institutions that have adopted the&#13;
Equator Principles for sustainable development.&#13;

    GEMLOC: BUILDING BOND MARKETS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES&#13;
    IFC has a key role in GEMLOC--the Global Emerging Markets Local Currency Bond&#13;
    Fund, which the World Bank Group initiated this year to help develop local currency bond&#13;
    markets so that they can attract more local and global institutional investors. The effort&#13;
    will establish local currency debt markets in developing countries as a separate asset class,&#13;
    measured against a new index of performance. In cooperation with the data and index&#13;
    provider Markit, IFC has developed a transparent index of emerging market local currency&#13;
    bonds. Launched in April 2008, the index offers investors transparent data on 20 countries,&#13;
    and will soon add more. Inclusion in it is based on market size and a set of criteria,&#13;
    developed by the ratings, research, risk, and policy advisory company CRISIL in collabora-&#13;
    tion with IFC, that assess the investment climate. The new index and underlying criteria&#13;
    set out guidelines countries can use to implement reforms that improve their index weight&#13;
    and attract additional investment; the program also offers advisory services to countries&#13;
    with a strong commitment to such reforms. A leading fixed-income investment manager,&#13;
    PIMCO, is also developing strategies to promote investment in these markets. The initiative&#13;
    responds to many governments' requests for help in strengthening bond markets as a way&#13;
    to support sustainable growth. It has a sunset provision of 10 years, when Bank Group&#13;
    involvement will cease and the private sector is expected to be fully engaged.&#13;

&amp;#12;HOW WE WORK&#13;
IFC's accomplishments reflect the shared values of&#13;
our staff worldwide--an emphasis on excellence,&#13;
commitment, integrity, and teamwork helps us make a&#13;
difference for the clients and countries we serve.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
IFC delivers results for clients by pursuing best practice in every aspect of our&#13;
operations--in our governance, our accountability to stakeholders, our focus on&#13;
sustainable development, and our commitment to the people who comprise IFC.&#13;
Our strong corporate culture--articulated this year as The IFC Way--is keeping&#13;
us focused on results amid rapid changes.&#13;
    Our organization is growing fast: about 40 percent of employees joined IFC&#13;
less than two years ago. We have increasingly gone local, with most staff based&#13;
in field offices, close to clients. As we have increased our activities in the poorest&#13;
countries, and the number of IFC staff there has nearly doubled since 2003.&#13;
    We work to ensure that development brings sustainable benefits to people&#13;
in emerging markets. We reach out to our local communities and aim to model&#13;
the high standards we ask of clients: IFC's own operations, for example, were&#13;
carbon-neutral for the first time in fiscal 2008.&#13;

 Note: Because World Bank Group (WBG) staff, other than U.S. citizens, usually are not required to pay income taxes on their WBG compensation, the salaries are set on a net-of-tax basis, which is generally equivalent&#13;
 to the after-tax take-home pay of the employees of the comparator organizations and firms from which WBG salaries are derived. Only a relatively small minority of staff will reach the upper third of the salary range&#13;

 a. Because World Bank Group staff, other than U.S.citizens, usually are not required to pay income taxes on their WBG compensation, the salaries are set on a net-of-tax basis.&#13;
 b. Approximate WBG contribution made to the Staff Retirement Plan and deferred compensation plans from July 1, 2007, through July 1, 2008.&#13;
 c. Other benefits include annual leave; medical, life and disability insurance; accrued termination benefits; and other nonsalary benefits.&#13;
 d. Mr. Zoellick receives a supplemental allowance of $75,350 to cover expenses as part of WBG contribution to other benefits. Because Mr. Zoellick is a U.S. citizen, his salary is taxable and he receives a tax allowance&#13;
 to cover the estimated taxes on his Bank salary and benefits. In addition to his pension, Mr. Zoellick receives a supplemental retirement benefit equal to 5 percent of annual salary.&#13;

&amp;#12;                                          An organization's corporate culture plays a central role in its ability to succeed.&#13;
                                          For IFC, which now has more than 3,000 employees in more than 80&#13;
                                          countries, the need for shared objectives is especially important. In fiscal year&#13;
                                          2008, we undertook the most extensive consultative process in our history in&#13;
                                          an effort to define our corporate culture, conducting 52 consultations in 31&#13;
                                          countries over a 10-week period. About 45 percent of IFC staff participated,&#13;
                                          evenly distributed between headquarters and field offices. We also considered&#13;
                                          recommendations from the 2007 IFC staff survey. The result is The IFC Way, a&#13;

                Our Vision                That people should have the opportunity to escape poverty&#13;
                                          and improve their lives.&#13;
&#13;

            Our Purpose                   To promote open and competitive markets in developing countries;&#13;
                                          to support companies and other private sector partners; to generate&#13;
                                          productive jobs and deliver basic services; and to create opportunity&#13;
                                          for people to escape poverty and improve their lives.&#13;
&#13;
             Our Core&#13;
      Corporate Values                    Excellence, commitment, integrity, and teamwork.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
   The Way We Work                        We help our clients succeed in a changing world&#13;
                                          Good business is sustainable, and sustainability is good business&#13;
                                          One IFC, one team, one goal&#13;
                                          Diversity creates value&#13;
                                          Creating opportunity requires partnership&#13;
                                          Global knowledge, local know-how&#13;
                                          Innovation is worth the risk&#13;
                                          We learn from experience&#13;
                                          Work smart and have fun&#13;
                                          No frontier is too far or too difficult&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Going forward, IFC management has committed to sustaining this focus on IFC's corporate culture and brand&#13;
 so that staff can serve clients better by attuning more closely to their needs, as well as work together more&#13;
                    closely across geographical, sectoral, cultural, and professional borders.&#13;

                                        munities. Staff are given time off each year for volunteer work.&#13;
                                        There is an annual Community Connections Campaign; this&#13;
                                        year, 46 percent of headquarters staff participated and raised&#13;

                                           IFC staff volunteer in their communities in several ways. This&#13;
                                        year, for example, staff in the Dhaka office used funds from an&#13;

                                        several key issues: waste management and air pollution; energy&#13;
                                        conservation; and reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Staff&#13;
                                        stimulated community outreach activities through consulta-&#13;
                                        tions, communications, and promotional activities. In Russia,&#13;

                            ON CERTAIN NONFINANCIAL ASPECTS OF THE REPORT&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
IFC has commissioned Corporate Citizenship to provide IFC's management with external assurance and commentary on certain&#13;
nonfinancial aspects of its 2008 Annual Report, specifically economic, social, and environmental sustainability and development&#13;
effectiveness information contained in this report. IFC's management has prepared the report and is solely responsible for its&#13;
content. Our objectives were to review specific aspects of its content and presentation, to conduct selected checks of underlying&#13;
corporate records, and to provide this statement, for which we have sole responsibility, in accordance with the terms of reference&#13;
with IFC. As part of our assignment, we have examined IFC's Development Outcome Tracking System (DOTS), which measures the&#13;
development effectiveness of IFC's investments and advisory services. In addition, we have reviewed certain development results&#13;
for investments published on IFC's report web site.&#13;
   Corporate Citizenship is a specialist management consultancy advising organizations that seek to improve their economic,&#13;
social and environmental performance around the world. A detailed note describing our relationship with IFC and the assurance&#13;
process we have adopted appears in our full statement online at www.ifc.org/annualreport.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
OUR OPINION&#13;
In our opinion, having reviewed relevant underlying IFC systems, the report provides a fair and balanced representation of the&#13;
progress IFC is making in carrying out its stated commitments as set forth in the text sections on the five strategic pillars and&#13;
"Where We Work" in the "Creating Opportunity" chapter. We have relied entirely on data and information provided by IFC and&#13;
published on IFC's web site, except where we expressly state to the contrary in our note on the assurance process. Where we have&#13;
identified material gaps in the completeness of available performance data and responsiveness to stakeholders, we note these&#13;
below in the Commentary section.&#13;
   In forming our opinion and making our comments, we have referred to the principles underlying the international assurance&#13;
standard AA1000 (www.accountability21.net), notably those concerning materiality, completeness and responsiveness. We have&#13;
also considered the reporting principles for defining content and the reporting principles for defining quality contained in Global&#13;
Reporting Initiative's (GRI's) G3 sustainability reporting guidelines (www.globalreporting.org).&#13;
   In reviewing DOTS, described on page 41, nothing came to our attention to suggest that IFC's methodology, which is consis-&#13;
tent with the good practice standards for private sector evaluation agreed among multilateral development banks, had not been&#13;
applied. Nor did it come to our attention that information had been materially misstated. Our methodology for testing DOTS is&#13;
presented in our full statement online.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   IFC A N N U A L REPORT 2008      129&#13;
&amp;#12;COMMENTARY&#13;
This is IFC's second Annual Report that combines information on its investments and advisory services, sustainability, development&#13;
effectiveness and donor partnerships. We believe this approach to reporting performance to be a good reflection of IFC's commit-&#13;
ment to integrate economic, social, and environmental considerations into its activities around the world. Having pioneered a new&#13;
approach to its reporting last year, we believe that IFC's 2008 Annual Report has been refined on several fronts, marking a step&#13;
forward from last year's report. IFC's report clearly articulates its activities to fulfill its mission through the overview of its opera-&#13;
tions, case studies, human interest stories, and discussion of its development results.&#13;
    Non-financial reports, such as this one, should explain how an organization impacts society, taking account of the key eco-&#13;
nomic, social and environmental concerns of its stakeholders. Reports should show how crucial decisions are made and differing&#13;
interests reconciled. They should be both balanced and honest about shortcomings. Our commentary is designed to assist readers&#13;
in understanding the extent to which this report measures up against that objective.&#13;
    Tackling the world's development challenges in a sustainable manner often raises difficult dilemmas at both the policy and&#13;
project level and requires balancing different stakeholder concerns. A report in line with best practice would illustrate the approach&#13;
to and resolution of dilemmas and challenges and allow stakeholders to see values in action. While the report does address IFC's&#13;
material operations, providing various levels of detail about different activities, it could do much more to explain to readers how&#13;
policy dilemmas and project-level challenges have been managed and resolved, particularly with regard to potentially conflicting&#13;
stakeholder interests.&#13;
    One such specific challenge that IFC faces is the corruption found in some of the countries where it does business. IFC has en-&#13;
hanced practices related to its internal anti-corruption program and has an approach for considering corruption when evaluating&#13;
potential investments. The report would be more complete if it discussed more fully these activities and other steps IFC is taking to&#13;
combat corruption in relation to its activities, both internally and more widely in society.&#13;
    Another major challenge is climate change, and we acknowledge the reference to IFC's climate change strategy in the report&#13;
and the work done to measure its own direct environmental impacts including carbon emissions. We recommend incorporating&#13;
into the report an emissions reduction component, covering targets for direct emissions. More challenging is to measure indirect&#13;
emissions, where work has begun, but reporting is not planned. However, given the importance of the issue and IFC's leadership&#13;
position, we recommend that IFC does report on the progress it is making on defining and measuring indirect emissions, describ-&#13;
ing its approach and providing even partial data when it becomes available.&#13;
    We recognize IFC's efforts in the report to address key findings from stakeholder feedback, including feedback we gathered&#13;
on IFC's Annual Report 2007. Responsiveness to stakeholder concerns would be further strengthened, if the report discussed the&#13;
lessons learned from such engagement and how these lessons were applied to other projects.&#13;
    We commend IFC on its continued efforts to openly assess, clearly quantify and systematically report the development ef-&#13;
fectiveness of its investments and advisory services and on the inclusion of additional information provided on the results mea-&#13;
surement web site. With the implementation of DOTS-2 during FY09, we expect data scope and quality to improve further. The&#13;
comparability of development results for investments across industries and regions would be further enhanced if development&#13;
results reflected varying degrees of challenge and risk associated with different types of investments and recipient countries.&#13;
    Reporting the development effectiveness of advisory services has been challenging for IFC, as the application of the monitoring&#13;
and evaluation framework is still in its early stages. However, efforts to enhance consistent data capture exist, and we expect the&#13;
streamlining of results indicators to enhance data quality and coverage.&#13;

NOTES AND DEFINITIONS&#13;
The fiscal year at IFC runs from July 1 to June 30. Thus, FY08 began on July 1, 2007, and ended on June 30, 2008.&#13;
&#13;
Investment amounts are given in U.S. dollars unless otherwise specified.&#13;
&#13;
On-lending is the process of lending funds from IFC's own sources through intermediaries, such as local banks and&#13;
microfinance institutions.&#13;
&#13;
Loan participants and IFC fully share the commercial credit risks of projects, but because IFC is the lender of record,&#13;
participants receive the same tax and country risk benefits that IFC derives from its special status as a multilateral&#13;
financial institution.&#13;
&#13;
Quasi-equity instruments incorporate both loan and equity features, which are designed to provide varying degrees&#13;
of risk/return trade-offs that lie between those of straight loan and equity investments.&#13;
&#13;
Rounding of numbers may cause totals to differ from the sum of individual figures in some tables.&#13;
&#13;
The World Bank includes both IBRD and IDA. The World Bank Group includes IBRD, IDA, IFC, MIGA, and ICSID.&#13;

            annual report 2008 : creating opportunity
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The International Finance Corporation
            (IFC) annual report continues an approach pioneered last
            year, combining information on the investments and advisory
            services, sustainability, development effectiveness, and
            donor partnerships. The report covers fiscal 2008 (July 1,
            2007, through June 30, 2008) and discusses the year's
            new business as well as the performance and development
            results of the portfolio. In FY08, new investments totaled
            $16.2 billion, rising 34 percent from the previous year. The
            IFC seeks to enhance the accountability and to articulate
            the vision, core corporate values, purpose, and the way the
            IFC works for a wide range of stakeholders: client
            companies, governments, partners, local communities affected
            by the activities, advocacy organizations, investors, and
            the staff.
