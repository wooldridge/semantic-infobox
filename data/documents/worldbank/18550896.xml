&amp;#12;Â·4. Conclusion&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The BSI has taken root in Uganda. A bridge                                      shortcomings of the BSI should be improved&#13;
has been crossed: there is no reason for                                        gradually. The graph below illustrates the&#13;
returning to the old way of executing                                           forecast up until2015, including cost reduction ,&#13;

the poor and local government institutions. The&#13;
BSI has proven to be a good pro-poor                                            Uganda can meet the Millennium Development&#13;
instrument.                                                                     Goals (MDG) if the BSI process continues to&#13;
                                                                                be refined, and Poverty Eradication Action Plan&#13;
The essential elements for effective functioning                                (PEAP) targets are also within reach . The&#13;
of the BSI have been put in place at district                                   outlook for the next 12 years indicates that the&#13;
level, including guidelines, policies, and human                                MDG are indeed within reach, however, targets&#13;
resources. Valuable experience has already                                      set in the Sector Investment Plan (SIP) and&#13;
been gained and must be built upon ; the                                        PEAP appear less attainable .&#13;

     The graph above illustrates the forecast up until&#13;
     2015 , including cost reduction , self supply&#13;
     options, increased funding and with or without&#13;
     systematic O&amp;M.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     The outlook indicates that both the MDGs and&#13;
     the more ambitious SIP targets are indeed&#13;
     achievable if increased funding can be&#13;
     combined with reduced unit costs, self-supply&#13;
     options and systematic O&amp;M . Even the&#13;
     Poverty Eradication Action Plan (PEAP) targets&#13;
     could be within reach. With continued&#13;
     refinement, indications are strong that the BSI&#13;
     process will further enhance accountp.bility and&#13;
     efficacy of Rural Water Supply (RWS) .&#13;
     Continued and improved implementation of the&#13;
     BSI thus offers the optimal approach to meet&#13;
     all these targets.&#13;

            Impact of the budget support instrument on

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This policy note examines the impact of
            the World Bank's poverty reduction support credit
            (PRSC) budget support instrument (BSI) in the context of
            rural water supply (RWS) and sanitation in Uganda. The
            policy note is based on a 2004 study commissioned by the
            World Bank: towards the millennium development goals (MDGs)
            in Uganda: a retrospective study of the impact of three
            years of the BSI on rural water. Uganda can meet the MDG if
            the BSI process continues to be refined, and poverty
            eradication action plan (PEAP) targets are also within
            reach. The outlook for the next 12 years indicates that the
            MDG are indeed within reach, however, targets set in the
            sector investment plan (SIP) and PEAP appear less
            attainable. With continued refinement, indications are
            strong that the BSI process will further enhance
            accountability and efficacy of RWS. Continued and improved
            implementation of the BSI thus offers the optimal approach
            to meet all targets.
