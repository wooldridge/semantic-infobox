ANNEX 1. MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING ON SOCIAL ASSET&#13;
DIVESTITURE AND UNEMPLOYMENT POLICY&#13;
March 25, 1995&#13;
Mr. Gautam Kaji&#13;
Acting President&#13;
World Bank&#13;
1818 H St. N.W.&#13;
Washington, D.C. 20433&#13;
Dear Mr. Kaji:&#13;
1.           As you know, Kazakhstan is implementing a comprehensive structural reform program&#13;
aimed at moving the country toward a market economy. This program has been supported by a&#13;
Rehabilitation Loan from the World Bank and an Upper Credit Tranche Standby Arrangement with the&#13;
IMF. A proposed Structural Adjustment Loan has been designed for Bank-financing.&#13;
2.           The Government's structural reform  agenda is giving priority to: (a) developing&#13;
competitive markets throughout the country; (b) reforming the enterprise and financial sectors; (c) putting&#13;
in place appropriate labor/social policies; (d) resolving bottlenecks in infrastructure and energy; and (e)&#13;
cleaning up the environment. Simultaneous progress on all fronts of the structural reform agenda is&#13;
essential for achieving stabilization.&#13;
3.           Privatization and enterprise reform is a central tenet of the Government's reform strategy.&#13;
In the past, state enterprises in Kazakhstan have owned and operated social facilities. These include&#13;
hospitals, polyclinics, kindergartens, summer camps, sports and recreational facilities, sanatoria, and&#13;
housing and other utilities. This pattern of social service provision is no longer tenable as enterprises&#13;
attempt to compete in the emerging market-based economy. Divestiture of social assets and the&#13;
concomitant reduction of costs and social liability is crucial to the Government's policy of enterprise and&#13;
social reform. It is also crucial to eliminate any incentives for workers to remain in enterprises simply&#13;
because they want to preserve their accessibility to social services provided by them.&#13;
4.           Local governments have to accommodate facilities divested from restructuring enterprises&#13;
in situations where their existing social services are already under-financed. Basic social services have&#13;
experienced budgetary decline of 40% in real terms since 1990, and over 80% of the health budget is&#13;
now allocated to salaries and essential utilities. Many social facilities, both ex-enterprise and municipal,&#13;
are operating at minimal levels due to a severe lack of critical equipment and consumables, and to a&#13;
significant skilled staff shortage, their departure to other countries because of a low prestige of their&#13;
work, low salaries, lack of equipment and supplies. In the short term, the sustainability of social services&#13;
depends more on increasing the availability of operating resources than investment capital. Local&#13;
govermments must also rationalize the structure and delivery of all essential social services, regardless of&#13;
their origin. Some facilities should be merged or closed, and others should be privatized, cost recovery&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 2                                                                               ANNEX 1&#13;
should be increased. Technical and financial support to local governments is critical during this period&#13;
of transition for essential recurrent expenditures, rehabilitation of facilities and rationalization of the&#13;
overall framework for social services.&#13;
5.            Enterprise restructuring and privatization is leading to higher levels of unemployment,&#13;
particularly considering the past excessive staffing in state enterprises. Although only around 100,000&#13;
people were registered as unemployed at the end of 1994, estimates of actual unemployed (including&#13;
hidden unemployment) were around 550,000. The Government recognizes that unemployment could&#13;
reach 1 million over the next two years, and that measures to promote labor adjustment and to establish&#13;
a viable social safety net are urgently needed. This would include programs to protect the unemployed&#13;
as well as a strategy to ensure the delivery of social services.&#13;
Rationalization of Social Services&#13;
6.            The Government will carry out an inventory of enterprise social assets and design a&#13;
comprehensive national strategy for their divestiture throughout the country. The strategy will aim at&#13;
preserving essential priority services to as large.a population as possible, consistent with fiscal constraints.&#13;
The strategy will be based on demographic characteristics, will specify appropriate service levels and&#13;
standards, and will include estimated operating costs. In view of its close involvement with the program,&#13;
the World Bank will be asked to review and comment on the draft National Strategy. The Government&#13;
intends to implement a pilot program in two oblasts (South Kazakhstan and Pavlodar) and has requested&#13;
World Bank financial support for this. The pilot program has been designed to ensure that it is replicable&#13;
throughout the rest of the country.&#13;
7.            Definition of essential services. The Government recognizes that some basic social&#13;
services need to be transferred from enterprises to local authorities in order to facilitate the process of&#13;
enterprise restructuring and to ensure the continued operation of essential social services. However, it&#13;
also believes that some social services previously provided by enterprises should be restructured or&#13;
privatized. The main criteria for the selection of social services, the operation of which should be&#13;
continued by the local authorities, would be those with significant public benefits and social externalities,&#13;
and for which privatization is not considered to be an option at least in the foreseeable future. These&#13;
would include polyclinics (secondary level hospitals) and kindergartens. Excluded would be sports and&#13;
recreational facilities, summer camps, sanatoria, and housing. Some essential social services with large&#13;
public benefits could be operated privately and this would be encouraged where possible, but in the short&#13;
term the scope for this is small and the divestiture needs of the enterprises are imminent. In due course,&#13;
as the private sector develops, opportunities for private management of essential services will be pursued.&#13;
8.            General service standards. The Government recognizes that the standards and norms&#13;
of the divested social services should be unified with those of comparable services run by the local&#13;
authorities, and that in general the standards and norms of social services previously operated by&#13;
enterprises will need to be reduced to fall within expected availability of fiscal resources. For example,&#13;
the ratio of children to teachers in the kindergartens will be expected to increase. Other ways of reducing&#13;
average unit costs and discrepancies in service provision between different localities will also be&#13;
examined. Similarly in the health sector, a review will be undertaken of appropriate levels of staffing&#13;
and infrastructure (including hospital beds), and also of possible reforms in budgeting and accounting to&#13;
facilitate greater efficiency and flexibility in the use of resources. The Government recognizes that there&#13;
is considerable over-utilization of existing health services and that average lengths of stay in hospitals are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1                                                                                Page 3&#13;
too long. Efforts will be made to reduce them. At the same time, the purpose of the national strategy&#13;
is to integrate and rationalize services at the local level, not to undertake comprehensive sectoral reform.&#13;
9.            Delineation of responsibilities. Basic social services are owned and operated by local&#13;
governments, either raion or municipal authorities. Higher level social services, such as regional referral&#13;
hospitals, are operated directly by the oblast governments. Essential social services which are divested&#13;
from enterprises, on the other hand, will be operated by the raions or municipal authority.&#13;
10.           Cost Recovery. The Government is revising a system of health financing. Considerations&#13;
are being given to the introduction of health insurance as an additional source of financing. At the same&#13;
time each group of population will have an access to a guaranteed package of free health services to be&#13;
financed from health insurance revenues. Legal mechanisms for introduction of user charges for health&#13;
services are being developed. The schedule of fees is to be designed; as well as standard fees throughout&#13;
the country. Fee revenue will be kept largely at the point of collection in order to provide maximum&#13;
incentives to the service provider. The effect of the new system of user charges will be monitored&#13;
carefully. In the education sector, fees will be raised for kindergarten attendance. Considerations will&#13;
be given to the design of mechanisms to ensure the continuous access to kindergartens of children of poor&#13;
families.&#13;
11.           Measures for local fiscal autonomy.  Government policy is to mandate local&#13;
administrations to continue the delivery of social services relinquished by enterprises and deemed&#13;
essential. This would be done within a rationalized system of service provision. In some cases, it will&#13;
be possible for enterprises and local authorities to enter into temporary arrangements so that part of the&#13;
incremental cost accruing to the authorities could be met by the enterprises. However, in most cases the&#13;
operation of social services previously run by enterprises will imply additional recurrent costs for local&#13;
authorities, although these will be reduced by rationalization. The local budgets will benefit from&#13;
increased tax revenues arising from enterprises being able to operate more productively as a result of their&#13;
releasee from social sector obligations. Ways will also be explored to allow local authorities greater&#13;
fiscal autonomy and increased revenue sharing to cover the costs of social services provision. In&#13;
addition, consideration will be given to allowing local authorities to retain some of the revenues from the&#13;
sale or rent of non-essential social infrastructure. However, until local governments have an independent&#13;
and sufficient financial base, provision will be made in the central budget to be presented to Parliament&#13;
for the required incremental costs of social services taken over from enterprises.&#13;
Unemployment Policy&#13;
12.           The Government is concerned about the social impact of the increase in open&#13;
unemployment which has already begun and is forecast to accelerate in the months ahead. Labor mobility&#13;
must be increased and workers should transfer from inefficient activities to new opportunities for&#13;
economic growth. The Government is aware, however, that the current system of Unemployment&#13;
Benefits (UB) has several weaknesses: the level of benefits is too low to provide significant relief or an&#13;
effective inducement for employees to accept retrenchment; the administration of benefits is unduly&#13;
complicated; the eligibility for UB overly restrictive in some ways. The structure of UB also needs to&#13;
be reconsidered in ways which will protect those most in need while avoiding work disincentives for other&#13;
groups. To address these concerns, the Government will implement a series of reforms.&#13;
13.           First, the financial administration of the Employment Fund will be changed and its&#13;
financial viability enhanced. Low priority activities (including for any wage subsidies and job creation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Pape 4                                                                           ANNEX 1&#13;
through credit schemes) will be discontinued. The use of the Employment Fund for non-employment&#13;
activities will be discontinued and the expenditure for the Fund will be made in accordance with the&#13;
Republican Program of Employment and the current labor market situation. By 1996 the expenditures&#13;
related to immigration will be completed from the Employment Fund. The revenue base for the Fund&#13;
will be broadened; the standard rates of contribution by employers will be extended to the agricultural&#13;
and budgetary sectors by 1996; and an employee-based contribution will be introduced at the same time.&#13;
The levels of both employer and employee contributions will be determined from time to time after a&#13;
careful and continual monitoring of the Fund, in the light of developments in the labor market, to ensure&#13;
its continuing viability as an independent Fund.&#13;
14.          Second, the systems for calculating UB will be restructured:&#13;
(a)    the basic level of UB will be determined on the basis of the minimum compensation (as&#13;
approved by legislation) paid to employees in the budgetary sector;&#13;
(b)   the structure for the payment of UB will be as follows:&#13;
(i)    school leavers will not be eligible for UB but will instead receive information&#13;
about their prospects and, as far as practicable, undertake further education or&#13;
training or be engaged on Temporary Employment Schemes (TES); participation&#13;
in either training or TES will then enable participants to build up a work history&#13;
and, consequently, eligibility for UB;&#13;
(ii)   students leaving post-secondary education and women returning to the labor&#13;
market after maternity leave will be eligible to receive the basic rate;&#13;
(iii)   unemployed workers in the agricultural or budgetary sectors will receive one or&#13;
two times the basic rate depending on their previous earnings or on other suitable&#13;
employment-related criteria. Guidelines will be prepared to define the criteria;&#13;
(iv)   other than the persons described in (ii) above, no benefits will be paid to people&#13;
who have not worked before, although such people will still be eligible to&#13;
participate in training or TES and, under separate eligibility, could still have&#13;
access to family allowances. Benefits will not be payable to people who separate&#13;
from a job voluntarily (guidelines will be prepared for Employment Service staff&#13;
to determine eligibility);&#13;
(v)    retrenched workers will receive two or three times the basic rate depending on&#13;
their previous earnings or on other suitable employment-related criteria.&#13;
Guidelines will be prepared to define the criteria; and&#13;
(vi)   unemployed workers engaged in training and TES will receive a slightly higher&#13;
amount than their UB entitlement.&#13;
(c)    unemployed people currently have eligibility for UB for only six months. If they have&#13;
been unable to find work within this time, they will be allowed to reapply for a furter&#13;
six months of UB provided they are willing to participate in TES when these are&#13;
available. Extension of benefits will only be granted in areas of particularly high&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 1                                                                           Page S&#13;
unemployment. Guidelines will be prepared to cover the conditions under which an&#13;
extension may be granted including covering the needs of people who are close to&#13;
retirement and the possible application of a means-test.&#13;
(d)   in view of the increases proposed in the level of UB, additional payments for dependents&#13;
would no longer be paid; however, recipients of UB may still apply for payments under&#13;
the separate family allowances provided they meet the income test provisions applying&#13;
in that scheme;&#13;
(e)   the pension rights of retrenched workers will be protected; and&#13;
(f)   the present obligation of employers for severance payments will be discontinued.&#13;
15.          Third, the administration of the ES will be improved. The process of registration and&#13;
application for UB will be strearnlined by changing the functions of the existing Commissions which&#13;
would act in special cases only. Instead, decisions on eligibility for UB would normally be made by the&#13;
ES staff themselves. A "work test" will be introduced to ensure that no one will receive UB if a suitable&#13;
work opportunity arises.&#13;
16.          To support the program of reform for social protection laid out in this letter, the&#13;
Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan has requested a Social Protection Loan from the World Bank&#13;
in an amount of US$41.1 million.&#13;

SOCIAL PROTECTION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 2. EMPLOYMENT SERVICES COMPONENT&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           A project preparation team from the Australian Department of Employment, Education&#13;
and Training (DEET) worked in Kazakhstan for 7 weeks in May-June 1994 to: (i) assist the Government&#13;
to prepare the strategy and action plan for the strengthening of the ES; and (ii) provide some initial&#13;
technical assistance to restructure the operations of the Employment Service (ES). As part of this work,&#13;
the consultants reviewed Unemployment Benefit (UB) administration and current registration procedures&#13;
and practices in the ES, and also examined the nature and extent of existing public works (PS) programs&#13;
and retraining arrangements for the unemployed.&#13;
2.           A number of policy issues were identified during the review regarding the: (i) need to&#13;
simplify and standardize the system of calculating UB; (ii) level and duration of UB (including for the&#13;
long-term unemployed); (iii) the requirement for notification by employers of vacancies to the ES; (iv)&#13;
procedures for registration and entitlement of UB; (v) responsibility of employers for funding severance&#13;
pay and retraining costs of retrenched workers; and (vi) Public Works programs and retraining of&#13;
unemployed workers.&#13;
3.           The preparation team worked with relevant officials in the ES to design a comprehensive&#13;
five-year plan for the ES. Valuable input was received from the Regional Conference of Oblast and&#13;
District Managers held at Pavlodar and the team also conducted a number of workshops with a range of&#13;
ES staff to ensure that extensive consultation and a wide rage of views were incorporated into the&#13;
development phase.&#13;
B. Employment Services&#13;
4.           The Ministry of Labor (MOL) is responsible for the operation of the ES through the&#13;
Department of Employment (DOE). It has a full-time staff of approximately 2,650 and is structured on&#13;
a National (Republic), Regional (Oblast) and District Office (Raion) level. In addition, there are about&#13;
1000 ancillary staff, drivers cleaners, security staff etc., many of whom are employed on a part time&#13;
basis. Apart from the Republic Office based in Almaty, there are offices in each of the 21 Oblasts, and&#13;
300 Raion offices with staffing levels ranging from 4 up to 18.&#13;
Functions of the Employment Service&#13;
5.           The main functions of the ES as described in their regulations are:&#13;
*     to develop and realize state policy in the employment and social protection of the&#13;
unemployed;&#13;
*     to analyze and forecast the labor market situation; develop and implement employment&#13;
programs;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 7                                                                             ANNEX 2&#13;
*      to improve the job placement process, and develop specific programs for the socially&#13;
vulnerable;&#13;
*      to interact with state management bodies, employers and trade unions on the problems&#13;
of employment and social protection of the unemployed;&#13;
*      to develop legislative and policy statements on employment problems;&#13;
*      to work with international cooperation in resolving employment problems;&#13;
Employment Fund&#13;
6.            Until recently, the ES covered its operational, program and unemployment expenditure&#13;
from the Employment Fund (EF), which was generated by a levy on employers. Falling collections and&#13;
a reduction in the levy from 3% to 2% have necessitated a change to the Department's funding&#13;
arrangements and these are now allocated as part of the government budgetary process. There are claims&#13;
by operational and regional managers that this change has already led to a reduction in the level of&#13;
funding provided to the ES and consequently a reduction in their ability to deliver services and programs&#13;
effectively.&#13;
7.            The fund can be used for any of the following:&#13;
*      payment of UB stipends and material aid,&#13;
*      payment during temporary invalidity,&#13;
*      training and retraining of the unemployed or retrenched,&#13;
*      paid public works,&#13;
*      lump sum allowances for the unemployed,&#13;
*      maintaining the state ES,&#13;
*      funding research into employment problems,&#13;
*      international cooperation,&#13;
*      payment of migration costs.&#13;
8.            The Government has a policy of financial support for immigrants returning to Kazakhstan&#13;
but there is no real justification for these costs to be met from the EFV. The most immediate effect of&#13;
the change, which took place when the EF was included in the central budget was the loss of reserves&#13;
to allow immediate responses to increased unemployment, and the loss of the additional revenue from&#13;
interest. Several Oblast (or City Offices) had written to the President asking for his intervention as they&#13;
had no funds to continue supporting the unemployed through benefits. While the situation persisted&#13;
payment of UB was decided by the amount of money available and not the claimant's entitlement. More&#13;
generally, it had also considerable impact on the cost constraints applying on the ES with less flexibility&#13;
than it had under the previous arrangements when the EF was independent. As unemployment grows,&#13;
the issue inevitably facing the Goverrnent will be the extent to which it is willing and able to provide&#13;
direct assistance to the unemployed through welfare payments.&#13;
As part of a policy reform agreed with the Government in the context of the proposed SAL, agreement has been reached with the&#13;
government regarding the non use of EF funds for non employment activities, and the removal of the EF from the centra budgeL&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX  2                                                                               Page 8&#13;
9.            Another area of concern is the level of collections of the EF levy. If the ES is to continue&#13;
to calculate and monitor levy contributions to be made by enterprises then a more structured changes&#13;
should be put in place to identify organizations that understate or avoid the levy and have penalties&#13;
applied to these organizations (see Annex 2C).&#13;
10.           The existing levy assessment procedures need to be reviewed to ensure that enterprises&#13;
are being accurately assessed and the collection of revenue is being maximized. One option would be&#13;
to remove the responsibility for collection from the individual employment offices and concentrate this&#13;
work at the Oblast Office.&#13;
Employment Service Delivery&#13;
11.           The location of raions was determined some time ago, based on circumstances different&#13;
from those likely to be encountered in the future. As conditions have changed in many districts, it is now&#13;
highly desirable that a review of the locations of existing offices be undertaken and that the requirements&#13;
for any additional offices over the next 3-5 years also be established.&#13;
12.           Staffing is allocated to EOs on the basis of fifteen staff per one hundred thousand of&#13;
population. There is minimal assessment of projected workloads nor are any specific local labor market&#13;
factors taken into account when staffing levels are being set. To ensure that staffing levels reflect actual&#13;
workloads and the labor market needs of particular locations, a simple staffing formula needs to be&#13;
developed to provide a more flexible method of setting and reviewing staffing levels for each office.&#13;
The Future&#13;
13.           The first priority is to ensure that the ES is able to effectively deliver its core functions&#13;
of registering jobseekers, receiving vacancies from employers, matching jobseekers with job vacancies&#13;
and the assessment and payment of UB. It is essential that these functions are carried out well if the ES&#13;
is to perform effectively.&#13;
14.           It is considered that refinements can be made and some functions substantially developed&#13;
to improve overall performance and service delivery. There are three key elements which should&#13;
underpin any changes proposed for the ES. These are:&#13;
*      Client Focus;&#13;
*      Self-help for clients; and&#13;
*      "Multi-skilling" of ES staff&#13;
15.           Client Focus means that the first priority for all staff in the office is to provide the best&#13;
possible service to their customers. The client's needs should always come first, whether they be a&#13;
jobseeker, an enterprise, or a person making a general inquiry. Clients visiting EOs have many different&#13;
needs and have differing abilities. Self-help is based on streaming and recognizes that some clients need&#13;
little additional help beyond providing them access to facilities and services which enable them to "short&#13;
cut" some of the conventional ES registration or job matching procedures. Properly introduced, this&#13;
approach enables significant savings in the numbers of staff required to handle growing unemployment&#13;
queues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 9                                                                         ANNEX 2&#13;
16.          Multi skilling means equipping staff with additional skills which would enable them to&#13;
carry out the duties of a number of different functions in the employment office. The objective of multi-&#13;
skilling is to provide staff the capacity to respond to increasing workloads more quickly and at the same&#13;
time to ensure that the qualify of service to the client is not diminished by staff changes. It also provides&#13;
staff with a greater understanding of the overall activities of the office and encourages greater teamwork.&#13;
The multi-skilling of staff would be an important feature in streamlining the ES. In addition, a major&#13;
component of any changes being implemented would be the work done on staff training and development.&#13;
Unemployment Benefit&#13;
17.          Unemployment Benefit was introduced in July 1991 and has been administered by the ES.&#13;
At present, a Comrnission, meeting in the local Employment Office, grants the status of 'unemployed'&#13;
and determines the rate and duration of payment. Arrangements are then made to pay the clients&#13;
fortnightly by cheque. The payment for retrenched workers is calculated as a percentage of their average&#13;
wage over the previous 12 weeks. Other workers, voluntarily unemployed or with no work history in&#13;
the previous 12 months, including former students, are paid at the minimum wage level. There is a&#13;
period of three months' disqualification for those who left their job voluntarily or violated the labor laws.&#13;
Barriers&#13;
18.          There are a number of barriers which unemployed people face when seeking to apply for&#13;
assistance:&#13;
-     Potential clients are unaware of the ES and its activities, particularly the payment of&#13;
Unemployment Benefit;&#13;
-     The admission procedures are cumbersome and the Commission acts as a deterrent to&#13;
claiming;&#13;
-     The level of payment for Unemployment Benefit, particularly for those who would be&#13;
paid at the minimum wage, is near worthless when considering the cost of living;&#13;
3     There appears to be an element of embarrassment associated with registering as&#13;
unemployed and more particularly with receiving Unemployment Benefit;&#13;
*     There appears to be concerns about having the "work book" stamped as having been&#13;
given the status of unemployed; and&#13;
*     The employment offices do not provide an inviting atmosphere. This barrier could be&#13;
a combination of the physical surroundings, the office location and the attitude of staff.&#13;
Unemployment Benefit Policy&#13;
19.          A number of major policy changes have agreed upon with the Government and would be&#13;
implemented through the proposed project: They include:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX  2                                                                           Page 10&#13;
20.           First, the financial administration of the Employment Fund will be changed and its&#13;
financial viability enhanced. Low priority activities (including for any wage subsidies and job creation&#13;
through credit schemes) will be discontinued. The use of the Employment Fund for non-employment&#13;
activities will be discontinued and the expenditure for the Fund will be made in accordance with the&#13;
Republican Program of Employment and the current labor market situation; however, the Fund will be&#13;
used to finalize some expenditure, estimated at xx million tense related to immigration but this will be&#13;
completed by the end of June 1995. The revenue base for the Fund will be broadened; the standard rates&#13;
of contribution by employers will be extended to the agricultural and budgetary sectors by the end of&#13;
1995; and an employee-based contribution will be introduced over the same time. The levels of both&#13;
employer and employee contributions will be determined from time to time after a careful and continual&#13;
monitoring of the Fund, in the light of developments in the labor market, to ensure its continuing viability&#13;
as an independent Fund.&#13;
21.           Second, the systems for calculating UB will be restructured:&#13;
(a)    the basic level of UB will be increased to three times the minimum wage (as approved&#13;
by legislation) which is approximately the minimum level of compensation currently paid&#13;
to employees in the budgetary sector. It will be linked to this arnount and adjusted on&#13;
a quarterly basis. Over time, the system will be based increasingly on insurance&#13;
principles;&#13;
(b)    the structure for the payment of UB will be as follows:&#13;
(i)    school leavers will not be eligible for UB but will instead receive information&#13;
about their prospects and, as far as practicable, undertake further education or&#13;
training or be engaged on Temporary Employment Schemes (TES); participation&#13;
in either training or TES will then enable participants to build up a work history&#13;
and, consequently, eligibility for UB;&#13;
(ii)   students leaving post-secondary education and women returning to the labor&#13;
market after maternity leave will be eligible to receive the basic rate;&#13;
(iii)   unemployed workers in the agricultural or budgetary sectors will receive one or&#13;
two times the basic rate depending on their previous earnings or on other suitable&#13;
employment-related criteria. Guidelines will be prepared to define the criteria;&#13;
(iv)   other than the persons described in (ii) above, no benefits will be paid to people&#13;
who have not worked before, although such people will still be eligible to&#13;
participate in training or TES and, under separate eligibility, could still have&#13;
access to family allowances. Benefits will not be payable to people who separate&#13;
from ajob voluntarily (guidelines will be prepared for Employment Service staff&#13;
to determine eligibility);&#13;
(v)   retrenched workers will receive two or three times the basic rate depending on&#13;
their previous earnings or on other suitable employment-related criteria.&#13;
Guidelines will be prepared to define the criteria; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 11                                                                          ANNEX 2&#13;
(vi)   unemployed workers engaged in training and TES will receive a slightly higher&#13;
amount than their UB entitlement.&#13;
(c)    unemployed people currently have eligibility for UB for only six months. If they have&#13;
been unable to find work within this time, they will be allowed to reapply for a further&#13;
six months UB provided they are willing to participate in TES when these are available.&#13;
Extension of benefits will only be granted in areas of particularly high unemployment.&#13;
Guidelines will be prepared to cover the conditions under which an extension may be&#13;
granted including covering the needs of people who are close to age-retirement and the&#13;
possible application of a means-test.&#13;
(d)    in view of the increases proposed in the level of UB, additional payments for dependents&#13;
would no longer be paid; however, recipients of UB may still apply for payments under&#13;
the separate family allowances provided they meet the income test provisions applying&#13;
in that scheme;&#13;
(e)    the pension rights of retrenched workers will be protected; and&#13;
(f)    the present obligation of employers for severance payments will be discontinued.&#13;
22.           Third, the administration of the ES will be improved. The process of registration and&#13;
application for UB will be streamlined by changing the functions of the existing Commnissions which&#13;
would act in special cases only. Instead, decisions on eligibility for UB would normally be made by the&#13;
ES staff themselves. A "work test" will be introduced to ensure that no one will receive UB if a suitable&#13;
work opportunity arises.&#13;
Claiming Unemployment Benefit&#13;
23.           At present, claiming UB is by invitation only. No application is completed but staff&#13;
submit cases to the Commission for consideration only if there is no possibility of the ES finding a job&#13;
for the client. If a client attends the office looking for work and there are no job available through the&#13;
ES and it is considered unlikely that jobs would become available in the short term, there is no reason&#13;
why the status of unemployed cannot be declared on the first day the client visits the office providing he&#13;
has ceasing working. The commencement of benefit would still be a separate decision but the client&#13;
should still be told about possible entitlement and the process to realize the entitlement.&#13;
Assessment and Approval of the Claim&#13;
24.           Under the present arrangements, a proposal is made by one of the employment officers&#13;
to the Commission seeking approval to grant the status of unemployed. This proposal contains all&#13;
relevant information to determine entitlement, commencement date and the duration of benefit. The&#13;
Commission is made up of a group of specialists from within each office. In some offices, this&#13;
Commission has up to seven members, although generally, the number is much less. In smaller offices,&#13;
a Commission of 4 or 5 would represent the whole staff. The Commission is used to ensure the&#13;
consistency of decisions but, as the number of cases increase, the time required to deal with cases would&#13;
become exorbitant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX  2                                                                           Page 12&#13;
Training and Development of Staff&#13;
25.           The three tiers of management in the DOE have distinct  but complementary&#13;
responsibilities for staff training and development. The Republic Office is responsible for national&#13;
training policies and strategies; development of a national training plan; organization of specialist training&#13;
for management; and monitoring of training activity and standards. The Oblast office is responsible for&#13;
developing strategic training responses to identified needs in Raion offices and providing assistance to&#13;
Raion managers in determining of training needs and evaluation of training activity. The Raion office&#13;
is responsible for these activities within its office and for providing induction training for new staff.&#13;
26.           The need for increased focus on training and development has been a constant theme&#13;
during discussions with executive and operational management. The same message also came from the&#13;
directions paper produced from the Pavlodar regional managers conference in May 1994, from responses&#13;
tot he survey questionnaire developed by the consultants for completion by key managers at all levels&#13;
within the Department and from the seminars with operational staff conducted by consultants.&#13;
27.           There is recognition that greater attention to development and training will lead to&#13;
increased efficiencies, more flexibility to respond to changing workloads, increased job satisfaction and&#13;
an improved image with the general community.&#13;
Staff Training and Development&#13;
28.           A skilled, flexible workforce is an essential requirement for any organization, particularly&#13;
where delivery of decentralized services is involved. The move towards a market economy, increasing&#13;
volumes of job seekers and changing expectations from enterprises and jobseekers, will all present new&#13;
demands on the Department of Employment, especially at the operational level.&#13;
Competency Based Approach&#13;
29.           A first step in the implementation process is the introduction of a basic Competency Based&#13;
Approach (CBA) to staff training and development. The approach can be relatively simple, quick to&#13;
introduce, cost efficient, and effective. Furthermore, it provides the basic for enhancement as the ES&#13;
develops over the coming years. The competencies should become the basis for identifying training needs&#13;
by providing the benchmarks against which individual staff are assessed - the process involves appraisal&#13;
of an individual's competencies against their job(s) requirements. The competencies an individual lacks&#13;
becomes their training needs.&#13;
Training&#13;
30.           The identification of training needs starts with the establishment of standard job&#13;
competencies and the assessment of staff against those competencies. This approach is equally effective&#13;
for identifying the training needs of new as well as experienced staff and it can be applied at all levels&#13;
of staff in the Department of ES.&#13;
31.           The overall training plan needs to be developed through an improved consultative process&#13;
across Oblasts and Raions, coordinated by the Republic Office. It should include identification of the&#13;
training needs of the organization and the individual, and aim to achieve economical and effective use&#13;
of training resources. The plan need not be elaborate but should be prepared to complement the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 13                                                                          ANNEX 2&#13;
operational plan. Forrnal training courses should be short, sharp and relevant, and wherever possible&#13;
should be conducted on site or involve distance learning approaches to reduce expensive travel and other&#13;
associated costs.&#13;
32.          There are many training activities common to staff of ESs wherever they are located.&#13;
Model training programs for the major functions such as induction, effective oral and written&#13;
communication, interpersonal skills, employment skills, and customer service should be developed and&#13;
incorporate a rnixture of formal and on-job training components. Because of the dispersed nature of the&#13;
ES, particular attention should be paid to development of self-teach packages including computer tutorials,&#13;
individual programs, work-books etc.&#13;
33.          An additional factor, necessary to support the training and development strategies, is the&#13;
need to move towards the multi-skilling of staff at the operational level. The importance of this aspect&#13;
cannot be overlooked if the ES is able to effectively respond to the volume of clients likely to be&#13;
encountered in the future. Plans for multi-skilling of staff should be incorporated in the overall&#13;
Departmental training strategy and complemented with a review of organizational arrangements.&#13;
34.          The Model Office will play a vital role in this arena by acting as an induction point for&#13;
new staff, 'benchmarking" performance standards, promoting multi-skilling, reducing staff training costs,&#13;
introducing a client service culture and delivering relevant formal and "on the job" training to staff from&#13;
other offices.&#13;
C. Strengthening Management System&#13;
35.          The DOE is a relatively new organization and during the past three years has implemented&#13;
its own employment laws based largely on those of the former Soviet Union. This legislation established&#13;
some new functions including the provision of ESs and social protection for the unemployed. With&#13;
twenty one Oblasts in Kazakhstan, the management structure is highly decentralized and Oblasts exercise&#13;
considerable administrative delegations.&#13;
36.          The charter of the DOE is defined in broad terms and provides for a range of functions&#13;
to be performed. However, overseeing and directing a large number of geographically dispersed,&#13;
independent regions and employment offices presents many challenges and a clear statement outlining&#13;
priorities, goals and objectives for the ES for each year is necessary if the Service is to become&#13;
increasingly effective. It is vital that this statement reflects the Government's priorities and is clearly&#13;
understood at all levels within the Department.&#13;
Lrabor Market Analysis and Policy Development&#13;
37.          A component of this project is aimed at improving the analysis and understanding of the&#13;
functioning of the labor market and provides for strengthening in the areas of policy development and&#13;
implementation. A major requirement for the future would be the capacity to establish policies based on&#13;
comprehensive and accurate data and to meet this need particular attention should be paid to strengthening&#13;
the labor market collection and analysis functions within the Department.&#13;
38.          The labor market analysis section of the Department has limited resources and capacity&#13;
to provide information and analysis of labor market trends. However, this function is vital and needs to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2                                                                          Page 14&#13;
be strengthened in order to provide accurate analysis and long range forecasts to enable the Department&#13;
to develop appropriate policies and strategies in response to changes in the labor mnarket.&#13;
39.          This function would be considerably enhanced by strengthening the collection and analysis&#13;
methodologies at the Republic, Oblast and Raion level, particularly in relation to the qualitative aspects&#13;
of labor market intelligence. It is imperative that the Department strengthen its capacity to research and&#13;
evaluate economic and other issues impacting on the labor market and delivery of services to enable it&#13;
to formulate relevant policy and program responses.&#13;
Management of the Employment Service&#13;
40.          It is equally important to establish an infrastructure which would ensure that policy is&#13;
effectively translated into operational delivery. For this to be achieved, the ES must have firm&#13;
performance targets to be achieved in all operational areas. Performance monitoring mechanismns should&#13;
also be put in place to measure the effectiveness of program and service delivery. A further consideration&#13;
is the need for 'change management' training to ensure that managers and supervisors at all levels of the&#13;
DOE and ES understand the changes being implemented and give their full commitment to them.&#13;
Assistance is being proposed to establish a national training facility with technical assistance to develop&#13;
and run appropriate training courses.&#13;
41.          It is recommended that clear priorities and performance targets be set for the ES which&#13;
reflect the Government's key objectives for labor market management. Improved operational and&#13;
management information systems should also be introduced to provide for more effective collection and&#13;
analysis of local labor market information and performance monitoring.&#13;
D. Active Intervention Measures&#13;
Training, Retraining and Upgrading of Skills&#13;
42.          The training, retraining and upgrading of the occupational skills of the unemployed is the&#13;
responsibility of the Kazakhstan Republic Center of Vocational Training which is part of the Department&#13;
of Employment. The legislative framework is contained in the Decree of the Cabinet of Ministers of the&#13;
Kazakh SSR of June 19, 1991 (N383). The method of imnplementation of the Decree is contained in the&#13;
Resolution of June 19, 1991 (N383) of the Cabinet of Minister of the Kazakh SSR Establishing the&#13;
System of Training, Retraining and Upgrading the Unemployed and Jobseekers.&#13;
43.          The primary objectives of the retraining program are:&#13;
*     to assess the needs of the labor market and provide relevant training;&#13;
*     to provide unemployed individuals with theoretical and practical training;&#13;
*     to assess the quality of training provided to individuals.&#13;
44.          The Republic Center for Vocational Training is responsible for policy interpretation and&#13;
development; interpretation of the professional training law; reviewing and setting the scholarship rate&#13;
(participant's training allowance); licensing of training establishments and approving course curricular.&#13;
It also maintains communication with other Ministries (e.g. Education) about education and training and&#13;
training policies and works on improving the design of the psychological testing (vocational testing)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 15                                                                          ANNEX 2&#13;
provided in ES and Training Centers. It provides funding allocations for Oblast Training Centers and&#13;
handles the collection of relevant statistical data. The Center has a staff of 38 people.&#13;
45.           Each Oblast is responsible for organizing retraining assistance to the local unemployed&#13;
population. It analyses the local labor market situation and assesses the requirements for skills that are&#13;
in demand from industry. In conjunction with the local Training Center it provides relevant retraining&#13;
courses. The minimum eligibility criteria for a person to participate in training is to be registered as a&#13;
jobseeker with the ES. If, after 8 days of registration, the person has not obtained a job, they may be&#13;
eligible for training on a number of grounds including a lack of sufficient skills for the labor market, a&#13;
need to change their skills, or the loss of ability to perform their current occupation. It is usual for an&#13;
occupational aptitude test to be undertaken at this point. The acceptance of retraining is optional for the&#13;
unemployed person and people can request to participate in a training course at their own initiative&#13;
provided they meet the eligibility criteria.&#13;
46.           Under the proposed project, a review will take place of existing arrangements for&#13;
providing training to the unemployed and efforts made to accelerate the development of courses to meet&#13;
expected skills shortages and to make unemployed people more competitive in the labor market. This&#13;
work would include a review of the approval process, funding arrangements and far greater involvement&#13;
of the private sector in providing input to course design as well as running more training courses. Pilot&#13;
programs should be developed in the selected Oblasts with particular emphasis on assisting unemployed&#13;
women and young people.&#13;
Public Works Programs&#13;
47.           A Public Works program is conducted in Kazakhstan under the auspices of Decree of the&#13;
Cabinet of Ministers of "The Ways of Establishing Paid Public Works in Kazakhstan" which was adopted&#13;
on 22 October 1991 (N624). The program is also contained in the Employment Law. The primary&#13;
objectives of the program are to provide unemployed people with temporary employment activities; to&#13;
provide the disabled, people who are going to be retired, and youth, with job placements; to provide job&#13;
placements for individuals who have not worked for a long period of time (women caring for children,&#13;
people taking care of the aged or disabled, ex-prisoners). the Public Works program involves activities&#13;
of low skill levels which are usually of a basic manual laboring nature.&#13;
48.           The minimum eligibility criteria for a person to participate in Public Works is to be&#13;
registered at the ES, but priority is given to those with the status of unemployed. Placements to Public&#13;
Works are made on an individual basis and the maximum period of placement is 6 months. Participation&#13;
in this program is voluntary and to that extent is largely self targeting with the bulk of the work being&#13;
undertaken in rural areas.&#13;
49.           There is need for review of existing eligibility, approval and wage levels and. There is&#13;
also need for Temporary employment Schemes to be developed to assist people who had become&#13;
unemployed directly as a result of the divestiture of social assets by enterprises. Pilot programs should&#13;
be developed in the two Oblasts, South Kazakhstan and Pavlodar, which would be involved in the Social&#13;
Services component of the project.&#13;

ANNEX 2                                                                           Page 16&#13;
Model Office&#13;
50.          The setting up of Model Offices (MOs) is proposed as the most effective way to achieve&#13;
change in the shortest possible time while at the same time ensuring that high standards are set and&#13;
changes are implemented consistently throughout all offices.&#13;
51.          The concept of a Model Office is not new; many organizations faced with increasing&#13;
competition, new challenges, or changing community and client expectations have used the approach to&#13;
develop and test improved ways to deliver services to clients and spread new ideas and "best practice".&#13;
The establishment of a number of MO is recommended as the most effective method introducing change&#13;
and to demonstrate to staff the effectiveness of the changes.&#13;
The Principles of Model Offices&#13;
52.          The guiding principles for model offices are efficiency and effectiveness. Any proposed&#13;
changes should be tested against these principles. MOs, to be established with financing from the&#13;
proposed project would specifically focus on new and better approaches to:&#13;
*     manage increase number of jobseekers;&#13;
X     improve work practices;&#13;
*     improve assessment and payment of Unemployment Benefit procedures;&#13;
*     simplify and streamline operational procedures;&#13;
*     improve client outcomes - both jobseeker and industry;&#13;
3     improve client satisfaction;&#13;
*     train ES staff;&#13;
*     maximize use of available technology;&#13;
e     select office locations and improve layout, furniture and equipment.&#13;
They would also pay attention to improving management systems and ways of reducing operational costs.&#13;
53.          MOs would provide comfortable surroundings for the client and streamlined procedures&#13;
that would result in client needs being met quickly and efficiently. The first stage of the proposal is to&#13;
establish model offices in five locations. These model offices would trial new procedures and would have&#13;
trained staff with up to date equipment. They would provide convenient and comfortable surroundings&#13;
for clients and would also act as a training centers for staff for surrounding areas. The DOE is keen to&#13;
move quickly on the establishment of Model Offices and has already selected Almaty and Pavlodar as the&#13;
locations for the first two offices.&#13;
E. Strengthening the Employment Service&#13;
Institutional Strengthening&#13;
54.          This sub-component would aim at strengthening the organization's capacity at the national&#13;
and oblast level to provide strong leadership and effective management for the ES. Three elernents would&#13;
be involved.&#13;
55.          Management Improvement. It would be important that managers and supervisors at all&#13;
levels in the organization understand and support the changes being made and provide strong leadership&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 17                                                                       ANNEX 2&#13;
during the implementation of the project. Change management workshops should be run to emphasize&#13;
their role in achieving the changes. Emphasis would also be place on sound financial management and&#13;
accountability for achieving work plans and operating within allocated budget.&#13;
56.          Labor Market Analysis. Analysis of labor market trends and access to up to date&#13;
management information on financial and operational statistics and business levels are also prerequisites&#13;
for sound decision-making and effective management and upgraded computer equipment is needed to&#13;
provide specialist staff at the republic level with enhanced capacity to undertake research on the labor&#13;
market and provide more detailed and timely management information.&#13;
57.          Policy Analysis. Technical Assistance and equipment should be provided to the MOL&#13;
to (a) develop the core policy making, program planning, budget formulation and financial control&#13;
system, including an audit capacity supported by a management information system; (b) develop a modest&#13;
research, evaluation and policy development capacity, as well as a program design and development&#13;
capacity in such areas as job placement, job development, testing and counselling, occupational analysis;&#13;
and (c) develop an employment service oversight and management capacity.&#13;
Unemployment Benefits and Service Delivery&#13;
58.          Unemployment Benefits. The current procedures relating to unemployment benefits are&#13;
cumbersome and complex and can prove to be barriers to unemployed people seeking to apply for&#13;
assistance. A detailed review of existing eligibility and approval criteria, including the level and duration&#13;
of payments, means testing and compliance arrangements should be undertaken. The role of approving&#13;
unemployment benefits should be delegated to individual staff with the Commission dealing only with&#13;
exceptional cases.&#13;
59.          Service Delivery. There is a need to review and streamline existing procedures for&#13;
dealing with jobseekers and employers and to prepare operational manuals and quick reference guides for&#13;
use by managers and supervisors when training new staff on the job. The results of this work need to&#13;
be closely linked with the implementation of model offices.  The establishment of model local&#13;
employment offices and the provision of support for their replication throughout the Employment Service&#13;
is recommended. The model would be developed with input from local employment services staff as well&#13;
as from senior staff in the ES and DOE. the setting up of model offices is proposed as the most effective&#13;
way to achieve changes in the shortest possible time while at the same time ensuring that high standards&#13;
are set and changes are implemented consistently throughout all offices. The first two model offices&#13;
would be established in Almaty and Pavlodar.&#13;
60.          Computerization. All Oblast offices and approximately 100 Raion offices have access&#13;
to computers and the DOE has a team of computer specialists located in Pavlodar. The ES is currently&#13;
using a locally developed software system, the Automated Information System for Job Placement (AIST)&#13;
to maintain basic information on jobseekers, enterprises and vacancy details. This software has recently&#13;
been upgraded to Version 4, however, the hardware limitations of the existing equipment prevent the&#13;
latest version from being used to its potential.&#13;
61.          A major upgrade of hardware and software is proposed to develop appropriate&#13;
enhancements to automate unemployment benefit calculations and payments as well as to accommodate&#13;
changes resulting from work on the standardization and streamlining of operational and procedural&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2                                                                           Page 18&#13;
guidelines in local offices. this would permit automated registration, benefits calculation and delivery&#13;
and record keeping by employment offices. This work would also include a review and update of the&#13;
IT strategy, in the light of emerging technology, to determine the extent and timing of proposals to&#13;
introduce local area networks (LANS) and to develop a national network.&#13;
62.          Mass Layoffs. Attention also needs to be paid to areas of high unemployment. Although&#13;
the ES has TES, it is generally ineffective. The TES needs to be overhauled before it can provide any&#13;
reasonable assistance to areas such as Kentau (one of the pilot cities in the Social Service Component)&#13;
that are virtually one company towns, and which are to be significantly affected by mass layoffs. As&#13;
enterprises divest themselves of social assets and undergo restructuring and privatization, significant&#13;
retrenchments are likely to occur. Specific strategies and responses should be developed to assist local&#13;
staff in the ES to cope with these situations. This would include the establishment of tripartite&#13;
retrenchment response teams (RRT) which would provide assistance to enterprises faced with large&#13;
redundancies.&#13;
Staff Training Development&#13;
63.          Staff Training and Development. There would be a major requirement to strengthen the&#13;
capacity of the ES to provide training and development for staff and to introduce multi-skilling. There&#13;
would be a need to determine the basic competencies required by ES staff and to undertake a training&#13;
needs analysis. Specific training courses should be developed to meet these needs and "train the trainer"&#13;
programs delivered to selected training staff of Republic, Oblast and Model Offices. The transfer of these&#13;
skills would then allow local trainers to take on the responsibility for training other staff in the ES.&#13;
A.           A National Staff Training Center needs to be established within the DOE to provide&#13;
facilities for training staff in the republic office in specialist topics. It would also be used to provide&#13;
general management and development courses for staff from oblast and rayon offices in management and&#13;
supervisory positions in topics such as financial management and accountability, operational planning and&#13;
performance monitoring.&#13;
Pilot Programs for Training and Retraining of the Unemployed&#13;
64.          Retraining. Existing arrangements for providing training to the unemployed would be&#13;
reviewed under the project and steps taken to accelerate the development of courses to meet expected&#13;
skills shortages and to make unemployed people more competitive in the labor market. Pilot programs&#13;
would be developed to be undertaken in three oblasts - Almaty, South Kazakhstan and Pavlodar. While&#13;
limited equipment would be purchased under the project for training institutions run by the Vocational&#13;
Training Centers, the emphasis would be on developing the ability of the centers to encourage and build&#13;
up training capacity in the private sector (paras 3.26 to 3.29 of appraisal report).&#13;

ANNEX 2A. LABOR MARKET TRENDS&#13;
A. Introduction&#13;
1.               The move to a market system is central to the reforms in Kazakhstan. This is as true in&#13;
labor markets as in other parts of the economy. This annex reviews the background to the labor market&#13;
in Kazakhstan and considers the growing problem of unemployment. Frictional unemployment is an&#13;
inevitable feature of a market economy, but increasing structural unemployment is a sign of more deep&#13;
seated problems of labor market adjustment. In Kazakhstan wage rigidity, segmentation and restrictions&#13;
on the mobility of workers are a major source of labor market imperfection. The conclusion is that the&#13;
overriding objective of policy in Kazakhstan must be to create conditions for the efficient operation of&#13;
labor markets. In the short-term some support for active labor market policies is required to assist the&#13;
growing numbers of longer term unemployed, return to work.&#13;
Population and Labor Force Participation&#13;
2.               Tables 1-1 and 1-2 in the following page summarize the most recent data on the&#13;
population and labor force in Kazakhstan.&#13;
3.               Population growth remained positive during the period 1989-1993, although tapered off&#13;
slightly after 1992. Total labor resources available to the economy continued to increase. The proportion&#13;
of the active population in employment fell slightly between 1989 and 1992, from 81% to 78.5%, but&#13;
recovered to 80.2% in 1993.&#13;
4.               An important indicator of recent social change is the proportion of persons above&#13;
retirement age, 60 years for men, 55 years for women, continuing to work. This trend is linked to the&#13;
decline in real value of pension benefits and declining capacity of the state to maintain the wide range&#13;
of welfare payments to which individuals and families are entitled.2 The fiscal strain of welfare&#13;
payments means that this trend is likely to continue in the short to medium term.&#13;
5.               The age and gender composition of the labor force for 1989 is given in table 1-2. The&#13;
age structure is indicative of a relatively young labor force. Twenty five per cent of the total population&#13;
and 37% of the employed population is between 15 and 30 years old. This pattern is widely observed&#13;
in the newly independent Republics of the FSU. The number of persons of pensionable age as a&#13;
proportion of the working-age population is currently around 35 percent, indicating a fairly high level&#13;
of 'old-age' dependency. Although as already mentioned however, a rising percentage of pensioners&#13;
continue to work after their official retirement age has passed.&#13;
2    Pensions are provided to workers reaching the age of eligibility, workers who have disabilities and children of deceased workers&#13;
Early retirement pensions are also provided to individuals in specific occupations such as teachers, doctors, mine workers, pilots,&#13;
performers and athletes. These pensions are intended to reward workers in difficult locations, dangerous occupation or those with&#13;
short career lives. Pension payments are covered by a Pension Fund based on payroll contributions from enterprises (37% tax in&#13;
1993) and a marginal contribution from employees (1% in 1993). Twenty percent of payroll contributions also go to the Social&#13;
Insurance Fund to cover short tenns insurance needs such as sick leave and maternity leave. Pension expenditures in Kazakhstmn&#13;
are estimated to be 7.2 percent of GDP in 1993, approximately three times higher than for countries with comparable per capita&#13;
incomes.&#13;

7.            High rates of female labor force participation in Kazakhstan, as in most Eastem European&#13;
and FSU economies, are directly related to widespread access to education, at least in urban areas, and&#13;
a system of childcare and maternity leave that make raising a family compatible with participation in work&#13;
outside of the home. Longstanding state ideology also emphasized that women should take their place&#13;
alongside men in the productive labor force. Transitional policies now make the future of such high&#13;
levels of female labor force participation somewhat unclear.&#13;
B. Migration&#13;
8.            National emigration figures for 1993 were in the region of 270,000, comnposed mainly&#13;
of ethnic Russians, Germans and Ukrainians. Many of these emigrants are skilled workers, mostly from&#13;
industrial sectors, leading to concerns over skills shortages in the future. The impact of emigration varies&#13;
by region. Areas of high industrial concentration are worst affected, as are areas of recent industrial&#13;
decline. For example, South Kazakhstan, a region that has been badly affected by the exit from the Ruble&#13;
zone, observed net out-mnigration from the ooblast of 15.9% in 1993 and 9.8 % for the first half of 1994.&#13;
Concem is being expressed over the emigration of skilled industrial workers from the oblast.&#13;
9.            National immigration figures for 1992/3 showed approximately 190,000 persons entering&#13;
the country, composed mainly of ethnic Kazakhs returning from neighboring states, but also a fairly large&#13;
inflow of Russians and other nationalities. The net impact of migration on the composition of the&#13;
working age population and the skilled labor force is difficult to determine until more detailed&#13;
demographic data is available, but numbers were sufficiently large in 1993 to offset the natural increase&#13;
in population (Table 1-1). The skill characteristics of migrants entering the country is not known,&#13;
although anecdotal evidence suggests that fewer skilled persons are entering the country than are currently&#13;
leaving.&#13;
10.           Internal migration is not well documented, but observation suggest that the flow of rural-&#13;
urban migrants is gradually increasing, and is likely to increase more rapidly once government finally&#13;
removes residential restrictions on workers (propiska). Most voluntary migrants to urban areas are young&#13;

males, mainly Kazakhs, in search of work in the growing informal trade and services sector of the large&#13;
cities. Some reverse migration from urban to rural areas has also taken place, mainly people made&#13;
redundant in urban services and industries and forced to return to rural areas in the absence of other means&#13;
of support in the large cities.&#13;
C. Economic and Social Prorde of the Labor Market&#13;
11.           The structure of employment by sector shows strong parallels with other transitional&#13;
economies (Figure 1-1). Employment in Kazakhstan is dominated by material sectors - industry, agriculture&#13;
and construction, evidence of its importance as a mineral and raw material producing economy. Compared&#13;
with the more advanced market economies, employment in service sectors is modest, whilst the agricultural&#13;
sector is a much more important employer of labor. This reflects the historically limited development of&#13;
service and service-type industries and the labor intensive production processes associated with agriculture.&#13;
In Kazakhstan, agriculture provides an important source of permanent and seasonal employment in almost&#13;
all regions.&#13;

12.           Employment by sector has also a regional and ethnic dimension to it. The two largest&#13;
ethnic population groups are the Kazakhs and Russians. Kazakhs represent approximately 44% of the&#13;
population and Russians account for about 34%. The remaining 22% of the population consists of&#13;
Ukrainians, Germans, Tatars, Uzbeks and other less numerous nationalities. The south of Kazakhstan,&#13;
with its relatively large rural population, has the largest number of ethnic Kazakhs. Most are occupied in&#13;
agricultural and livestock activities. The more industrial towns in the region tend to have a higher&#13;
proportion of ethnic Russians and Germans than the rural areas. In the more industrialized and urbanized&#13;
north and east of the country, Russians are the most numerous population group, and are mainly emnployed&#13;
in industrial and construction sectors (less than 22% of industrial jobs are occupied by ethnic Kazakhs).&#13;
13.           While the evidence is still weak, regional and ethnic factors indicate that the national labor&#13;
market is not unified but is segmented, leaving some regions in a more or less permanent state of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2A                                                                                       Page 23&#13;
disequilibrium. For example, South Kazakhstan has a long tradition of excess supply of labor, although&#13;
within the region certain industrial towns experience more or less permanent labor shortage. State&#13;
controls on labor mobility and a history of narrow skill definition3 have exacerbated market&#13;
segmentation, probably increasing the vulnerability of some regions and population groups to&#13;
unemployment.&#13;
14.            Recent government reforms to improve the micro-functioning of labor markets in&#13;
Kazakhstan, including removal of the propiska system, removal of wage coefficients and privatization of&#13;
the housing stock, should have a positive effect on labor mobility and market clearing. A shift towards&#13;
demand driven vocational training would also help to increase the relevance and transferability of workers&#13;
skills. Nonetheless, constraints to improved market operation still exist in the form of excess demand&#13;
for housing and the high cost of relocating workers, and institutional barriers to job mobility, particularly&#13;
for women workers. The large number of workers on unpaid and forced leave, retaining their entitlement&#13;
to enterprise facilities, including schools, clinics and sanitoria, adds a further disincentive to worker&#13;
mobility.&#13;
15.            Evidence of other forms of labor market segmentation, particularly occupational&#13;
segmentation, is difficult to confirm without more detailed empirical research. However, qualitative&#13;
evidence does point to some occupational segregation by gender. Women employees are heavily&#13;
concentrated in the social sectors, in light industry, and in sub-sectors of agriculture. All are relatively&#13;
low paying and often, with the exception of education and health sectors, low-skill occupations. This is&#13;
despite the good educational achievement of most women workers in Kazakhstan. Qualitatively, the&#13;
mismatch between education and jobs appears higher for women than men in all sectors, although&#13;
quantitative research on the intensity of gender segregation in Kazakhstan is still needed.&#13;
16.            Empirical studies from two societies with strong parallels in Kazakhstan -Russia and&#13;
Uzbekistan - provide some clues to the pattern of gender segregation in Kazakhstan. Econometric&#13;
analysis of occupational wage data from Russia shows that, controlling for education and age, for the&#13;
sarne occupation women are paid less than men. Tests for discrimination reveal fairly widespread wage&#13;
discrimination by gender. In Uzbekistan, cultural norms about appropriate work for women and men are&#13;
more deeply entrenched than in Russia, especially in rural areas.  Women workers are heavily&#13;
concentrated in low-skill and unskilled occupations with low pay and very few opportunities for job&#13;
mobility.&#13;
17.            One explanation given for lower average female earnings throughout the FSU is the&#13;
disincentive effects on employers created by generous maternity and child care leave. Mothers are&#13;
entitled, in addition to an allowance of 126 days at full pay after 30 weeks of pregnancy, up to two years&#13;
unpaid leave with job security. Pregnant workers are also entitled to sick leave on full pay. This package&#13;
is generous by international standards. Extended leave means that women are treated differently in the&#13;
workplace. They are perceived by employers as non-permnanent or semi-permanent workers, more costly&#13;
than hiring men and less of a worthwhile investment than men. Consequently women are paid less, on&#13;
Vocational and technical training tends to produce highly specialized workers with only limited transferable skills. For example.&#13;
workers are trained as crane drivers, or truck drivers, or tractor drivers. Welders are trained in a highly specific set of welding&#13;
techniques to fit a particular job description. This is one way of enterprises raping the full benefits of trained workers.&#13;
essentially mnaking them less likely to transfer their skills elsewhere. In the context of labor market adjustment it creates a serious&#13;
problem of worker immobility.&#13;

average, than men. The effect of lower wages is to reduce the opportunity cost of time spent by women&#13;
in domestic work, thus reinforcing the domestic division of labor and women's double burden.&#13;
D. Transition and Labor Market Adjustment&#13;
18.             Employment data from the beginning of the reform period show a fairly high degree of&#13;
responsiveness of employment levels to changing market conditions, although overall, employment&#13;
reduction still lags well behind output contraction.&#13;
19.             Employment decline varies sharply by sector. Industrial employment started declining&#13;
in 1988, falling by 4% in 1990 and a further 9% by the first quarter of 1992. The largest absolute&#13;
decline since 1990 occurred in the non-material sectors, shedding almost a half a million workers,&#13;
followed by construction (200,000 workers). Agricultural employment, on the other hand, grew by about&#13;
4% over 1991-2 and continued to grow in 1993. Contrary to the early trend, government employment&#13;
grew in 1993, by 7%  in the first 5 months, after a 13%  contraction in 1992. Tables 1-4 to 1-6 give the&#13;
most recent picture of worker retrenchments by sector.&#13;

20.           Total retrenchments for 1993 were 46,707, 88% of which were in the state sector. By&#13;
June of 1994, the number of retrenchments had already reached the total 1993 figure, with over 84%&#13;
taking place in the state sector. The total for 1994 is likely to be a significant increase on previous years.&#13;
Average monthly lay-offs in industry, construction, transport and agriculture show the largest increase&#13;
over the year. Lay-offs in social sectors and other service sectors stabilized with a slight reduction in&#13;
average monthly layoffs in housing, public utilities and consumer service. The sharp rise in monthly&#13;
retrenchments in material sectors is indicative of the gathering pace of enterprise restructuring in 1994/5.&#13;
21.           In line with the early reform years, the number of women laid-off in industry and in&#13;
social and service sectors exceeds the number of men. A high percentage of these are manual jobs. The&#13;
three fold increase in the number of male workers laid off in industry, agriculture and transport is an&#13;
indication of a new and important trend of increasing male unemployment which will continue as&#13;
restructuring in industry gathers pace.&#13;
22.           The level of open unemployment has risen sharply in 1994. National figures released by&#13;
the Department of Employment for November 1994, show 78,500 persons registered as unemployed,&#13;
compared to 38,000 for the whole of 1993. By the end of 1994 the average unemployment rate for the&#13;
Republic was approximately 1.2%.&#13;
23.           Employment Offices receive on average   7,000 new  registrations per month,&#13;
total although workers finding jobs and those becoming ineligible for assistance make the monthly net&#13;
increase substantially less than this, in the region of 3,000 to 3,500 or approximately 4 percent per&#13;
month. Between 40 and 50 percent of registered job seekers are eligible for unemployment benefit.&#13;
While the flow into unemployment is low relative to OECD countries, the flow out of unemployment has&#13;
also been low. Once workers become unemployed they have great difficulty finding a job. The monthly&#13;
exit rate of unemployed workers into work is low, probably in the region of 3 to 5%. Well below&#13;
comparable rates in the USA in 1992 of nearly 25%. Thus there is a danger that unemployment will&#13;
become like a stagnant pool of labor, with limited turnover into the labor market. Figures on the number&#13;
of long term unemployed workers reveal that was in the beginning primarily frictional unemployment is&#13;
now progressing into a deeper seated problem of structural unemployment (Table 1-7).&#13;

24.            Sixty seven percent of the registered unemployed in 1993 were women, by the second&#13;
quarter of 1994 this had fallen to 58% mainly because of increasing registrations by male workers&#13;
affected by retrenchment. In terms of the educational level of unemployed persons, the majority have&#13;
general secondary education and above. On average 8% of unemployed women and men have higher&#13;
education qualifications. A slightly larger percentage of women have specialized secondary or technical&#13;
education - 31% compared to 23% amongst men - and fewer women have incomplete secondary&#13;
education than do men. On average, unemployed women have a slightly higher level of educational&#13;
attainment than do unemployed men, and unemployed youth have a lightly lower level of educational&#13;
attainment than older unemployed workers. Even though open unemployment rates among women are&#13;
high, it is likely that they would have been even higher if many had not left the labor force completely.&#13;
25.            The regional distribution of open and long term unemployment for early 1994 reveals&#13;
some sharp contrasts between the north, center and south (Map 2646 and Table 1-7). The highest rates&#13;
of open unemployment - between 2.1 % and 4.0% of the economically active population - are currently&#13;
in the far west, specifically Atyrau ooblast. Rates between 1.1% and 2.0% were found in South&#13;
Kazakhstan, and in the eastern ooblast of Semei (Semipalatinsk) Lowest average rates of unemployment&#13;
were recorded in central and northem regions and in Almaty and Leninsk City. Northern regions are&#13;
home to many of the largest industrial enterprises in Kazakhstan, mainly involved in mining and&#13;
processing of ferrous and non-ferrous metals and machinery and equipment manufacture. Restructuring&#13;
in many of these enterprises has been slow, although large numbers of workers in these enterprises are&#13;
currently on part-time or unpaid forced vacation, which is hidden from official unemployment data, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2A                                                                             Page 27&#13;
the most recent data indicate that retrenchments are now on the increase. Recent government measures&#13;
in the area of credit and bankruptcy law are also expected to increase the pace of restructuring in 1995.&#13;
26.           Long-term unemployed has increased virtually everywhere, but as a proportion of those&#13;
out of work in each region the problem is greatest in western and northern Kazakhstan. The reasons for&#13;
growing long term unemployment are various. First is the fact that workers often find new jobs while&#13;
still employed. Employers often prefer job-top-job transitions because they have better information on&#13;
an already employed person than an unemployed person. Second, workers who remain unemployed for&#13;
sometime become discouraged and give up looking for work. Third, imbalances in the distribution of&#13;
unemployed and job vacancies. This geographic mismatch is aggravated by poor mobility and a weak&#13;
housing market.&#13;
27.           Figures 1-2 to 1-4 summarize the latest data on rettenchuments by region and sector and&#13;
show northern and eastern regions taking the brunt of adjustment in industry and in agriculture. The fact&#13;
that this is not fully reflected in open unemployment figures for the two regions reinforces the view that&#13;
retrenched workers are still not registering for unemployment benefit, even when they may be entitled.!&#13;
In almost all regions retrenchments of women exceed those of men. In Kustanay, where the gap is&#13;
greatest, it is retrenchments of women agricultural workers that is largely responsible.  In East&#13;
Kazakhstan and Semipalantinsk, women are being retrenched from industry. The region of heaviest male&#13;
retrenchments is Akmola, an area dominated by heavy and mining industries.&#13;
4The Departnent of Employment estimates that of a total of 80,000 retrenched workers only 12% have registered with the ES.&#13;

28.           Officially registered unemployment is nonetheless just the tip of the unemployment&#13;
problem in Kazakhstan. As already mentioned, large numbers of workers throughout the country are&#13;
presently engaged on part time or on extended unpaid leave. Accurate national estimates are hard to find&#13;
but the current estimnate is that over 500,000 workers are actually unemployed or close to 7% of the labor&#13;
force5. As an illustration of the magnitude of the problem Table 1-8 summarizes the recent estimates for&#13;
the two ooblast participating in the Social Services Component of the Social Protection Project.&#13;

29.           Hidden unemployment in Kazakhstan, as in the rest of the FSU, has a long history. In&#13;
the old employment system it was associated with a regime of excess demand for labor, manifest in the&#13;
mismatching of jobs and skills, low productivity and 'capricious' labor turnover (Barr 1994). In the&#13;
transition period the problem is associated with 'labor hoarding' by enterprise managers adopting a 'wait&#13;
and see' strategy in relation to macroeconomic change. Expectations that transitional policies will mean&#13;
a return to pre-existing levels of employment have not been radically revised, despite evidence of falling&#13;
aggregate demand. More generally, uncertainty over expected improvements in economic relations with&#13;
Russia and other FSU countries has made enterprises reluctant to shed trained and trusted workers. Labor&#13;
5   ILO estimates put this much higher, at close to one million workers out of work, but their estimate includes raembers of the labor&#13;
forcc who would not otherwise be in paid work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 30                                                                                       ANNEX 2A&#13;
retention has also been made possible by real wage cuts6 and relatively easy access to government&#13;
credits. This is anticipated to change in 1995. Employers have also been deterred from severing contracts&#13;
because of obligations to pay 3 months severance pay on termination. Proposed enterprise liquidations&#13;
for 1995 and slight improvements in real wages as inflationary expectations are modified indicates that&#13;
labor hoarding will be less feasible for enterprises in the short and medium term.&#13;
E. Short and Medium Term Labor Market Issues&#13;
30.             The data presented in this annex have, by vecessity, been largely descriptive because of&#13;
an absence of more detailed and analytical material on the labor market in Kazakhstan. Nonetheless from&#13;
these data a number of important trends in the labor market have been identified for the short and&#13;
medium terms.&#13;
(a)     The first and most obvious short term trend is the increase in open unemployment, partly&#13;
due to new redundancies and partly to workers in hidden unemployment switching into&#13;
open unemployment. This can be expected to increase once unemployment benefit levels&#13;
are adjusted to reflect average earnings in the labor market. Industrial layoffs are also&#13;
expected to be compounded by the growing number of unemployed school leavers and&#13;
discharged military personnel;&#13;
(b)     The length of the unemployment period is also rising and is expected to continue to&#13;
increase. This is due to the relatively low rate of turnover amongst the unemployed&#13;
themselves and to geographical mismatching between areas of unemployment and new&#13;
vacancies;&#13;
(c)     Female labor force participation is expected to decline, a reflection of the artificially high&#13;
labor force participation rate of the Soviet period. This has implications for household&#13;
income, dependency ratios and the current structure of state-funded family allowances and&#13;
child support;.&#13;
(d)     Male unemployment as a share of overall unemployment will increase because of&#13;
restructuring in industrial sectors. The magnitude of unemployment depend greatly on&#13;
how rapidly the private sector can respond to new incentives and improvements to labor&#13;
market mobility. Proposed changes in the propiska system will undoubtedly be a catalyst&#13;
to more open and regular rural-urban migration within Kazakhstan, especially amongst&#13;
the youth and rural areas hardest hit by recent employment contraction. However, with&#13;
continuing contraction un urban industrial employment, and with slow growth in the&#13;
establishment of large private sector businesses, a significant proportion of these migrants&#13;
are likely to find work in the informal, private trade and services sectors.  The&#13;
employment and income potential of these sectors will depend greatly on the pace of&#13;
change in local capital markets and the regulatory business environment;&#13;
In 1992 real annual wages averaged about 30% below their 1991 level. By 1993, wage setting mechanisms had begun to adjust&#13;
to high inflation although, due to the lagged and step-wise adjustment of nominal wages to inflation, average annual real wages&#13;
declined by a further 7% in 1993. The dramatic decline in the minimum wage during 1992, when it was reduced to about 20%&#13;
of its end-of 1991 level in real terms and to 10% of the average wage in real terms in 1994, means that the minimulm wage has&#13;
become largely irrelevant to wage setting outside of the government sector (Fig 1-5).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2A                                                                                  Page 31&#13;
31.            Short and medium term labor demand is related to imnproved market responsiveness in the&#13;
former SOE sector, the growth of the commercial services sector and the development of institutions&#13;
capable of supporting flexible, small scale enterprise. Labor market effectiveness is closely linked to&#13;
changes in the market for housing, in the system of land allocation and in the functioning of insurance and&#13;
capital markets.&#13;
32.            The medium and long-term policy objective in Kazakhstan must be to create the necessary&#13;
conditions for efficient labor market functioning. In the transition period, a combination of active and&#13;
reactive labor market measures are necessary to provide some degree of protection to households in the&#13;
face of major income shocks and to assist unemployed workers return to work. Some of these issues are&#13;
pursued in Annex 2b.&#13;

SOCIAL PROTECTION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 2B. GENDER TARGETED TRAINING&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.           The Kazakhstan Government has a commitment to providing vocational  training,&#13;
retraining and upgrading to the unemployed. In 1991 the Government established a Republic Center for&#13;
Vocational and Professional Training under the Ministry of Labor, with a central office in Almaty and&#13;
regional offices in each of the 19 Oblasts. The training centers (TCs) provide information, screening&#13;
facilities and training assistance to registered unemployed persons considered eligible for the scheme.&#13;
Training courses are mainly sub-contracted from public education institutes in the immediate locality,&#13;
including vocational schools, technical colleges and higher education institutes. A limited number of&#13;
training centers offer courses directly, ranging from arts and crafts to auto-mechanics. The capacity to&#13;
offer courses directly depends on the material location and conditions of each of the centers, which varies&#13;
widely. Trainees are provided with allowances to participate in training courses which are based on past&#13;
salary levels and work experience. Trainees without work experience are paid at the level of the&#13;
minimum wage or unemployment benefit, which ever is greater, plus a IOOT transport allowance.&#13;
2.           The present system of vocational training for the unemployed has some strengths and a&#13;
number of weaknesses. On the positive side, training for the unemployed is being handled outside the&#13;
Employment Offices. EOs direct potential trainees to the Centers, but are not involved in either assessing&#13;
or placing trainees in courses. On the negative side, Directors of the TCs report both to the Chief of the&#13;
Oblast EO and the Director of the Republic Training Center, which create tension over the way in which&#13;
the Centers should run. Again on the positive side, the majority of courses offered by the centers are&#13;
sub-contracted. On the negative side the Centers sub-contract only to the state education system which&#13;
is probably the slowest of all state institutions to respond to changes in the economic environment.&#13;
Courses are often out of date, narrowly defined and out of touch with the demand side of the labor&#13;
market. Courses offered to women, for example, tend to reflect stereotypes of the work women are being&#13;
expected to do rather than any understanding of what the market is actually demanding. Some state&#13;
training institutions are beginning to offer business management, and computer training courses, although&#13;
trainers are ill-equipped to provide state of the art curricula in these areas.&#13;
3.           At least two fairly sizable private sector training institutions are operating in Kazakhstan,&#13;
both based in Almaty. These are the Kazakhstan Institute of Management Economics (KIME), established&#13;
in 1992, and the Kazakh-American International Business Institute (KAIBI), established in 1991. KIME&#13;
offers two year degree courses in business administration and economics. KAIBI offers short term&#13;
courses in market economics, business and management. As of November 1994, a further 19&#13;
organizations claimed to provide management training in Kazakhstan, although a USAID report on their&#13;
activities indicated that most were offering only limited seminar-courses on management issues. There&#13;
is nevertheless a general lack of credible training institutions in Kazakhstan. The absence of training&#13;
explicitly for self-employment and small-enterprise is also a problem in Kazakhstan, especially where a&#13;
dynamic and growing small business sector will be crucial not only because of the need to generate&#13;
productive employment opportunities, but because of the critical role of these firms in building a new,&#13;
decentralized market economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
PaRe 33                                                                        ANNEX 2B&#13;
4.           The record on vocational training in the FSU is generally considered to be weak, and&#13;
unresponsive to market forces. This is not something exclusive to FLU however, vocational training&#13;
generally has a mixed record of success also in OECD economies. However, there are many factors to&#13;
be taken into consideration in interpreting this finding. Firstly, numerous evaluations from OECD&#13;
countries show that it is not vocational training per se that is at fault but the institutional arrangements&#13;
under which training is provided, which are not always the most appropriate for responding to rrkrket&#13;
demand. Second, training for the unemployed is always more risky than training in-house or upgrading&#13;
existing employees. Thirdly, training or skilling for self-employment, which is an important branch of&#13;
vocational training in any economy, is associated with a high attrition or failure rate because of other&#13;
factors affecting the viability of businesses - access to finance, markets and infrastructure.  This&#13;
underlines the need to think carefully about training for self-employment and identifying viable demand-&#13;
side opportunities for small business.&#13;
5.           Despite the mixed record of vocational training, the Govermnent of Kazakhstan and the&#13;
Bank remain supportive of training as an active response to the process of labor market adjustment, in&#13;
the belief that to abandon well targeted, selective training would probably be very costly in both human&#13;
and economic terms in the long run. For the unemployed population, a large percentage of whom are&#13;
women, although the immediate monetary returns to training are difficult to demonstrate, the longer term&#13;
benefits of flexible and carefully selected training in terms of job search capability, adaptability,&#13;
confidence and awareness of the business environment are potentially quite large.&#13;
B. The Training Sub-Component&#13;
6.           The training sub-component of the proposed project would have two main components:&#13;
(a)    To strengthen existing institutional capacity for training for the unemployed by improving&#13;
the intermediary role of regional training centers (TCs).&#13;
(b)    To support development of a Business Start-Up Training Program.&#13;
7.           The intermediary role of regional TCs would involve: (a) identifying training and&#13;
retraining courses; (b) negotiating contracts with training providers; (c) providing training assessments&#13;
for training applicants; and (c) screening applicants for technical courses. TCs would be discouraged&#13;
from offering courses of their own,' instead they would focus on their intermediary functions. However,&#13;
this intermediary role needs to be diversified and made more responsive to offer all prospective trainees&#13;
a wider choice and better quality of training courses in areas with sound employment prospects. Many&#13;
of these areas are related to the small scale business or self employment sectors of the economy, poorly&#13;
covered by most public training courses. The TCs would therefore be encouraging private sector training&#13;
institutions and NGOs with an interest in self-employment or micro-enterprise development to bid&#13;
alongside public training providers for training contracts. Given the domninant role of the TCs they&#13;
should be encouraged to 'shop around' for suitable training courses, improve quality control and monitor&#13;
the effectiveness of training outcomes in terms of labor market success. Trainees would also be&#13;
encouraged to participate in financing their own training, at least to a nominal amount, so as to confirm&#13;
their commitment to the program.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2B                                                                          Page 34&#13;
8.           The TCs already have the beginnings of a data base that is of value to employers and&#13;
trainees alike, but with budget cuts, TCs are severely restricted in developing this aspect of their work.&#13;
Information for employers on trainees suitable for in-house training programs, for trainees on where to&#13;
look and shop around for training in non-traditional skill areas, and guidance from trained counsellors&#13;
on where to look for commercial training providers or business schemes is crucial for matching trainees&#13;
with jobs in the changing Kazakhstan economy. This kind of information exchange helps to improve self-&#13;
selection capabilities on the part of trainees and reduces the likelihood of waste in state-funded training.&#13;
Employers also have a clearing house for information on the kinds of trained persons they might wish&#13;
to employ in the future. Information, guidance and publicity services of TCs should be widely available&#13;
to all persons interested in some form of training.&#13;
9.           Under the proposed pilot project, funds would be provided for technical assistance to&#13;
strengthen the intermediary role of two oblast training centers and in Almaty. Technical assistance would&#13;
also be provided for the design of pre-entry screening and orientation courses for unemployed persons&#13;
wishing to become self-employed or establish a small business.&#13;
10.          The Business Start-Up Program would involve training in business plan development for&#13;
self-employment and micro-enterprise development. Unemployed persons above 21 years would be&#13;
eligible for the program, but specific measures would be used to encourage participation by unemployed&#13;
women. This would include promotional campaigns, targeted counseling and advice for women&#13;
completing applications to the program and reserved places for women on the program. A two-day&#13;
orientation course would be an essential prerequisite for joining the program during which time&#13;
prospective trainees are expected to finance their own costs.&#13;
i1.          Training under the program would be sub-contracted to NGOs, independent trainers or&#13;
local business centers who would agree to provide course modules of 4 - 6 weeks to fit into an overall&#13;
package of training lasting 3 - 4 months in total. Training would be oriented towards particular sectors&#13;
based on an assessment of local business opportunities. Trainees would be put in touch with existing&#13;
businesses and encouraged to join or formn associations to share information and expertise.&#13;
12.          Managers on the Start-Up program will be encouraged to make contact with institutions,&#13;
local or international, providing alternative sources of finance for micro-entrepreneurs.  In an&#13;
environment such as Kazakhstan where capital markets are thin and imperfect, micro-enterprises are&#13;
severely short of working capital. Programs such as Trickle-Up, Women's World Banking, WomanKind&#13;
and others have an explicit interest in financing micro-entrepreneurs and would be credible collaborating&#13;
institutions in such a program.&#13;
C. Specific Proposals for Funding&#13;
13.          Funding would be provided to support the following activities:&#13;
(a)    Technical assistance - six months to review and revise the existing procedures for training&#13;
assessment and screening in line with new methods and expected demands in the labor&#13;
market. Strengthen counselling and advisory services for the unemployed seeking&#13;
training. Advise on the preparation and implementation of a Training Needs Assessment&#13;
in each oblast, in collaboration with local research team;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

(b)     Technical assistance8 - six months to advise on the design and development of the&#13;
Business Start-Up Program. Preparation of general orientation programs and training of&#13;
trainers;&#13;
(c)     Supply of basic office equipment and refurbishment of classroom facilities at the TCs to&#13;
run orientation courses for the Start-Up program, plus development/translation of basic&#13;
library materials on training for trainers and business development; and&#13;
(d)     Oblast level workshops would be financed to encourage learning and information&#13;
exchange about training for self-employment and micro-enterprise. Collaboration with&#13;
other training partners would be sought.&#13;
Including EDI and/or International NGOs with a reputation in this area are being explored. Grant assistance for the provision of&#13;
training is also being explored.&#13;

ANNEX 2C. IMPACTS OF EXPENDITURE AND REVENUE PATTERNS&#13;
ON THE EMPLOYMENT FUND&#13;
1.           The attached table and chart illustrate the impacts of different unemployment scenarios&#13;
on the Employment Fund (EF) by the end of 1996. At the end of 1994, the proportion of the labor force&#13;
receiving Unemployment Benefits (UB) was about 1.8% or 100,000 people. All scenarios assume that:&#13;
(a) the growth in the number of unemployment beneficiaries would be constrained by the application of&#13;
strict rules governing eligibility for receipt of benefits after 6 months unemployment; and (b) the&#13;
probability of a person remaining unemployed for 6 months would be about 25% and that half of these&#13;
unemployed would be denied further UB beyond the six-month period. The model, therefore, assumes&#13;
a reasonable turnover among the unemployed, due partly to them finding work and partly to them&#13;
withdrawing their applications for benefits.&#13;
2.           Scenarios 1-3 - high-case unemployment with growth of 6% a month; by the end of&#13;
1996, the number of people receiving UB would increase to about 440,000. Scenario 1 shows what&#13;
would happen to the EF if reasonable revenues were maintained through the employer levy of 2%&#13;
(although at best one could expect only 50% of employers to pay the levy) and the 1% employee&#13;
contribution (again with only 50% of employees actually paying). By December 1996, revenues and&#13;
expenditures of the EF would sustain monthly surpluses though they would be declining; the Fund would&#13;
still have a healthy accumulation of over 3 billion tenge. Scenario 2 illustrates what would happen if less&#13;
revenue were collected due to refusal by the authorities to implement the 1 % employee contribution&#13;
(contributions fall from 50% to 0%), and Scenario 3 illustrates declining revenues due to failure by&#13;
employers to collect the 2% levy (contributions also fall from 50% to 33%, as collection methods fail&#13;
and avoidance rises). Declining collections may well happen as employees switch from larger enterprises&#13;
to smaller businesses or the informal sector.&#13;
3.           Scenarios 4-6 - medium-case unemployment with growth of 4% a month; by the end&#13;
of 1996, the number of people receiving UB would increase to about 280,000. Scenarios 5 and 6&#13;
employ the same alternative revenue shortfall assumptions as Scenarios 2 and 3.&#13;
4.           Scenarios 7-9 - low-case unemployment with growth of 2% a month; by the end of&#13;
1996, the number of beneficiaries would increase to about 175,000. Scenarios 8 and 9 employ the samne&#13;
alternative revenue shortfall assumptions as Scenarios 2 and 3.&#13;
5.           These three sets of scenarios show that by the end of 1996, each percentage point increase&#13;
in the proportion of the labor force receiving UB would reduce accumulated EF funds by 400-500 million&#13;
tenge. Equally noticeable is the impact that declining revenues will have on the assets of the Fund itself.&#13;
The absence of the 1 % employee contribution (Scenarios 2, 5 and 8) would cost the Fund 2 billion tenge&#13;
by the end of 1996; while a decline in employers' contributions from 50% to 33% (Scenarios 3, 6 and&#13;
9) would cost the Fund almost the same amount.&#13;
6.           Opinion in Kazakhstan is divided about the prospects for growth of unemployment. Many&#13;
people believe that it will be no greater than 2% a month. In the absence of reform, this could well be&#13;
the case, but assuming that the reforms take hold, even the 6% scenario may be too low. The low&#13;

~~Fage 37                                                                             ANNEX 2C&#13;
growth in unemployment to date has encouraged some in the Government to consider reducing the 2%&#13;
levy, which has made it difficult to get them to agree to any extension of the base (such as extending it&#13;
from enterprises to the budgetary and agricultural sectors; see Annex 1, paragraph 14). If, however,&#13;
unemployment does not increase (as in Scenarios 7-9) the EF should have a substantial positive balance,&#13;
which could encourage authorities either to divert the revenues to general budgetary use or to sustain&#13;
employment in unattractive enterprises by, for example, making cheap loans available.&#13;

SOCIAL PROTECTION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 3. DETAILED FEATURES OF SOCIAL SERVICES COMPONENT&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.            Traditionally enterprises - especially large ones - have often been responsible for provision&#13;
of social services not only to their employees but also to the general population in their conmmunities.&#13;
These services included housing and related utilities, healthcare, kindergartens, community facilities&#13;
(cultural, recreational and sport), summer camps and dormitories. Local governments provided similar&#13;
municipal services in parallel. The share of municipal and enterprise services varied, depending on the&#13;
local productive profile, and the comparative financial and administrative capacity of local authorities and&#13;
enterprises. For example, in Almaty municipal services dominated, while those provided by enterprises&#13;
were limited and targeted primarily to enterprise employees. In smaller communities, dominated by one&#13;
or several large enterprises, firms have delivered the bulk of services.&#13;
2.            With hardening budget constraints and privatization of state-owned enterprises, firms have&#13;
begun divesting non-productive assets and in many cases have transferred facilities to local governments.&#13;
When a municipality is unable to accommodate additional facilities, case-by-case solutions are being&#13;
sought, including: (a) enterprises transfer ownership of facilities to local administrations, but continue&#13;
financial support for an interim period; (b) enterprises close social services and commercialize the&#13;
premises; and (c) enterprises continue to provide some basic services, including operating costs in the&#13;
costs of general production.&#13;
3.            In order to preserve essential social services, the Govermnent is seeking strategic solutions&#13;
to this problem, including preparing - with project support - a national strategy for dealing with&#13;
divestiture of enterprise social assets, and ensuring continued access to essential social services. As far&#13;
as housing is concerned, the Government believes that the main avenue of discharging enterprises from&#13;
expenditures is to deepen privatization. However, this complex issue is being addressed separately. It&#13;
was agreed at identification that the Project would focus only on selected health facilities (polyclinics and&#13;
hospitals), and kindergartens.  As the first step in developing a meaningful divestiture strategy, local&#13;
governments need to assess the essential facilities which they are able to sustain.  All other services&#13;
would need to be privatized, closed or retained by enterprises without state support. In many cases&#13;
facilities with low rates of occupancy could be amalgamated.&#13;
4.            As a long-term solution for sustained development of social services, broader sectoral&#13;
approaches are needed. Reforms to the health care system have been proposed by MOH in provision,&#13;
financing and management. New operating and financing principles in the health sector would contribute&#13;
to sustainable development of public health services. The Project focuses primarily on restructuring of&#13;
municipal financial mechanisms rather than on broader sectoral changes, though it seeks to facilitate&#13;
implementation of such reforms in the pilot oblasts.&#13;
5.            A clear definition of the social role of kindergartens needs to be developed. In some&#13;
cases they are primarily day care institutions facilitating female employment. In others, they are early&#13;
child development centers, since they provide pre-school education, primary medical care, nutrition,&#13;
inununization etc. Yet the coverage rate nationally is only around 40%, in some cases due to the limited&#13;
capacity of the system. Though more work is being completed under the project on the incidence and&#13;
impact of state-funded kindergartens, a critical minimum of kindergartens should be preserved in each&#13;
project city in the short term. In parallel with Project inplementation, the Government should revise&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 41                                                                            ANNEX 3&#13;
the principles covering access to kindergartens within the framework of a national strategy for social&#13;
services.&#13;
6.            Both national and local governments should also consider the commercial aspects of the&#13;
divestiture process. While most enterprises are keen to divest themselves of social services, they are&#13;
often not keen to divest themselves of the assets which have commercial value as real estate. While&#13;
some flexibility should be given to companies to choose whether to retain social services or not, in cases&#13;
where social facilities are closed and premises are commercialized, local governments may need to&#13;
support divestiture of assets for the benefit of the community, or develop arrangements for allocation of&#13;
leasing revenues.&#13;
7.            The Project assumes that in the context of local budget constraints, the only ways to&#13;
sustain essential social services in a community are to: (a) undertake comprehensive rationalization of&#13;
social expenditures; (b) raise cost effectiveness of services; and (c) bring total social spending into line&#13;
with local budgetary constraints.&#13;
8.            There are various options in developing city-specific rationalization strategies, including:&#13;
(a)    Amalgamation of services. Released assets could be used for commercial purposes, thus&#13;
contributing to modest revenue increases for local budgets;&#13;
(b)    Improved targeting of social services for vulnerable groups;&#13;
(c)    Introduction/increases of userfees, through charges for selected medical services, and&#13;
increased fees in budget kindergartens (with appropriate exemption schedules);&#13;
(d)    Privatization of non-essential services. These services could be targeted to the higher&#13;
end of the consumer market, and provide optional services in education and health care&#13;
of higher quality; and&#13;
(e)    Closure of some facilities in cases where: (i) there is over-supply; and/or (ii) the&#13;
community can not properly finance them.&#13;
B. Project Approach to Individual Types of Social Assets&#13;
Kindergartens&#13;
9.            Kindergartens play a broader role in education and child-care in Kazakhstan and other&#13;
FSU countries than they do in Western countries. Children attend from around 2 years of age until&#13;
primary school (at the age of 6-7). Attendance, however, has never been universal and has recently fallen&#13;
to around 40% of the respective age group. The major coverage is in urban areas.&#13;
10.           In 1992-93 the share of enterprise-owned kindergartens declined from 72% to 60%. The&#13;
decline appears to have accelerated in many regions since that time. Trying to sustain the kindergarten&#13;
system in both the budget and enterprise sectors, the Government has allowed increases in user fees up&#13;
to 30% of food costs. However, a generous fee exemption and reduction schedule has resulted in lower&#13;
than expected fee revenues. The project seeks to support continued kindergarten provision, by promoting&#13;
more cost effective operation (e.g. improved food procurement practices; revision of specialist teacher&#13;
ratios), and support for a more transparent and better enforced fee schedule.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3                                                                            Page 42&#13;
Medical Facilities&#13;
11.          Three types of medical facilities are operated by enterprises: polyclinics, hospitals and&#13;
sanatoria. Polyclinics provide basic health care. Though they offer basic health care services, they are&#13;
staffed by health specialists, since there has traditionally been no general practitioner training in&#13;
Kazakhstan. In developing methods for more effective polyclinic service delivery, a number of issues&#13;
arise which relate also to the operation of hospitals (e.g. referral practices).&#13;
12.          Local governments already run most hospitals, though some enterprises "sponsor"&#13;
facilities, contributing to selected expenditures. In the two oblast capitals (Shymkent and Pavlodar cities),&#13;
there are also a number of oblast hospitals, which perform certain central functions for the whole region.&#13;
These operate to a significant degree in an integrated manner with municipal hospitals (e.g. common&#13;
emergency rosters, centralization of common functions). The size and cost of the health system in&#13;
project cities will not increase to any significant degree as a result of divestiture. The overwhelming&#13;
majority of hospitals and polyclinics are already on the budget, so that the bed/facility increment is&#13;
marginal. The project would support an integrated approach to provision of different levels of healthcare&#13;
in the participating cities.&#13;
C. Features of Project Design and Implementation&#13;
13.          The Social Service Component is of a pilot nature. It would provide support to five cities&#13;
in two oblasts: Shymkent, Kentau, Lenger (South Kazakhstan oblast), Pavlodar and Aksu (Pavlodar&#13;
oblast). The five cities have different economic and demographic conditions, so that models developed&#13;
will provide lessons for replication in various parts of the country.&#13;
14.          While overall implementation responsibility for the project remains with the central&#13;
Government - which has established a PCU in the MOF to coordinate project activities - implementation&#13;
of the Social Services Component will be done predominantly by the administrations of the two oblasts&#13;
and five cities. Local and oblast administrations have been involved in project preparation since its early&#13;
stages. They have developed rationalization proposals, and draft first year work programs have already&#13;
been prepared as a condition of negotiations. The project will finance necessary technical assistance.&#13;
In particular, technical assistance and training will be provided in:&#13;
(a)    financial management;&#13;
(b)    sector-specific mnanagement practices in health care and early education (including&#13;
specialized procurement);&#13;
(c)    strategic and operational planning;&#13;
(d)    monitoring and evaluation; and&#13;
(e)    staff and management training.&#13;
15.          The Project will be carefully monitored, partly to ensure effective implementation, partly&#13;
to identify improvements in social service policy and provision that would inform a national strategy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Pafe 43                                                                                ANNEX 3&#13;
16.           Under the Loan, the following types of expenditures would be financed:&#13;
(a)    modest rehabilitation and upgrading of selected health and kindergarten facilities financed&#13;
by the budget, regardless of their origin (ex-enterprise or existing municipal);&#13;
(b)    purchase of critical supplies and equipment for selected budget medical and kindergarten&#13;
facilities (medical equipment, drugs, vaccines, textbooks, kitchen equipment), regardless&#13;
of their origin; and&#13;
(c)    financing of recurrent costs of divested facilities on a declining basis with a condition of&#13;
local co-financing.&#13;
D. Sustainability of Services&#13;
17.           In the long run sustainability of local social services can only be ensured with general&#13;
increases in productivity and tax revenues which are a direct result of economic growth and strengthening&#13;
of tax administration. This would be a key feature for replicating project models nationwide. However,&#13;
it is also crucial to ensure short term support for social services under the present pilot project. Estimates&#13;
show that while in most localities this is feasible, in Kentau, the financing gap emerging with the increase&#13;
of publicly supported social facilities will be difficult to bridge by rationalization, cost recovery and&#13;
privatization. Such localities with low tax base would require some support from the oblast and/or central&#13;
budget, at least in the medium-term.&#13;
18.           Sustainability requires that cost increases for kindergartens as a result of divestiture are&#13;
offset by the end of the project by: (i) rationalization/cost savings in the health sector on an almost&#13;
constant number of budget hospitals/polyclinics; (ii) fee revenue, from introduction of health care user&#13;
charges and increases in kindergarten fees; and (iii) reduction of inefficiencies within the municipal&#13;
kindergarten system, resulting in savings without affecting quality of service (e.g. more competitive&#13;
procurement practices). Provided these reforms can be introduced in the five cities, the Government&#13;
wil not be required to spend any more in real terms after the project than it does currently on the&#13;
selected services, despite the fact that the transfer of social assets is initially adding an average&#13;
across the five cities of around 20% to local social expenditures.&#13;
19.           Given a health system where initial costs are roughly the same, the project aims to&#13;
facilitate/leverage significant cost reductions and new sources of revenue over project life, to ensure a&#13;
more affordable system (with the caveat that broad sectoral reforms are not the objective of the project).&#13;
Cost reductions could be of several types, including: (a) closure and merger of small specialist facilities&#13;
into departments of general hospitals. This will save substantial amounts in utilities costs (which run up&#13;
to one third of total facility costs), even if all staff etc. are transferred to the other facility. Savings will&#13;
be higher if some staff can be encouraged to set up private practices; (b) centralization of services for&#13;
hospitals (e.g. laboratory; equipment repair/maintenance) which are currently duplicated in inefficient&#13;
ways; (c) revision of treatment protocols nearer to international standards, to reduce high average length&#13;
of stay for non-acute patients; and (d) introduction of revised payment mechanisms, such as capitation&#13;
or fee-for-service. The two main options for new sources of financing are: (i) introduction of user fees&#13;
for selected health services; and/or (ii) introduction of mandatory health insurance (with locally generated&#13;
revenues preferably kept at the local level). The Government in its Memorandum of Understanding&#13;
(Annex 1), has indicated that it is considering introduction of both options as a priority.&#13;

SOCIAL PROTECTION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 3B. RATIONALIZATION PLANS&#13;
A. Background&#13;
1.            The central element in the Social Services Component is development and implementation&#13;
of framework rationalization plans and detailed annual work programs (WPs) for each of the participating&#13;
cities. While the plans and work programs would give clear outlines for efficient social service&#13;
expenditures, there would remain some flexibility in implementation, as rapidly changing economic&#13;
circumstances dictated.&#13;
2.            Detailed 1995 WPs have been prepared for each participating city in both South&#13;
Kazakhstan and Pavlodar oblasts. The WPs detail activities to take place in the cities concerned during&#13;
the first year of the project as restructuring of the enterprise sector continues and social assets are&#13;
transferred from enterprises. The priority facilities included in the project are kindergartens, polyclinics&#13;
and hospitals. The actual pace and magnitude of the divestiture have been assessed and tailored to the&#13;
particular circumstances of each locality. WPs would be prepared and reviewed annually, and an&#13;
assessment made of implementation of the previous years' program.&#13;
3.            The project has already provided assistance to local administrations in development of&#13;
detailed programs for transfer and restructuring of social assets, management improvements and&#13;
implementation of framework rationalization plans. Implementation of AWPs is expected to lead to&#13;
savings and increased efficiency in the management of kindergartens, hospitals, and polyclinics through&#13;
the removal of constraints such as underutilized capacity, duplication of services, weak financial and&#13;
budgetary management, inefficient equipment purchase and maintenance, and uncompetitive food&#13;
procurement practices.&#13;
4.            The detailed AWPs are based on the framework provided by the rationalization plans.&#13;
They are to be prepared annually by ad-hoc working groups within each local administration, which have&#13;
been assisted by external consultants in preparation of first year work programs. The first step for each&#13;
locality was to update the inventory of enterprise and municipal social assets and make an assessment of&#13;
their level of utilization, need for physical rehabilitation, and equipment and supply requirements. Based&#13;
on the information obtained, a first year asset consolidation plan has been prepared, including detailed&#13;
reconmmendations for closing or merging of facilities. A rehabilitation, equipment and supply purchasing&#13;
plan has also been defined. For enterprise assets, discussions have been and will continue to be held with&#13;
enterprise managers to reach agreement on an appropriate timetable for transfer of assets in a manner&#13;
consistent with the capacity of local administrations to manage them and finance resulting incremental&#13;
costs.&#13;
5.            Management Efficiency Improvements. The investments to be financed under the&#13;
project will not produce the desired results if overall management of social assets is not improved. The&#13;
project includes technical assistance to local and national administrators in the areas of financial and&#13;
budgetary management and expenditure control and reporting. Assistance would be directed particularly&#13;
towards developing sector-specific management skills in the health and education sectors, so that, in&#13;
addition to the benefits in facilities supported by the project, there would be efficiency gains in the&#13;
management of primary and secondary education. A number of fellowships and study tours would also&#13;
be provided, in order to give local and national officials exposure to effective management practices in&#13;
other countries. By including national officials in training, the benefits of lessons learnt during project&#13;
implementation can be incorporated into rationalization programs in other parts of the country.&#13;

B. Common Assumptions in Rationalization Plans&#13;
6.           A key element in the definition of transfer and restructuring programs would be&#13;
establishment of operating standards for essential social services that would be uniform within each city&#13;
and would apply to all assets, both existing municipal ones and those previously owned by enterprises.&#13;
As a first step toward definition of uniform operating standards, a set of basic common assumptions have&#13;
been mnade for the component as a whole: (i) unit rehabilitation costs per facility; (ii) unit investment&#13;
costs; (iii) unit supply costs; (iv) the percentage of incremental recurrent cost financing provided by the&#13;
Bank; and (v) the target level of cost recovery expressed as a percentage of recurrent plus supply costs.&#13;
These common general assumptions are summarized in Table 3b. 1:&#13;

7.           Cost Recovery Measures. The difficult financial situation of both enterprises and the&#13;
cities make it unlikely that the latter can meet the incremental recurrent cost financing requirements of&#13;
the project under present circumstances, even with the financing provided by the project. The project&#13;
therefore includes gradual introduction of cost recovery measures for the services covered. User fees&#13;
would be set in a flexible and differentiated manner from sector to sector and in a manner to protect&#13;
socially vulnerable groups. The cost recovery schedules above therefore allow for some exemptions from&#13;
user charges. In the health sector, the ultimate target of 10% cost recovery is consistent with experience&#13;
in a range of middle income countries. For kindergartens, municipalities are already recovering some&#13;
of their costs under the authority of a 1993 Presidential Decree. Although revenues vary regionally&#13;
(according to the proportion of poor families, and fiscal and other factors in the area), current cost&#13;
recovery in municipal kindergartens in South Kazakhstan and Pavlodar oblasts is in the range of 3-6%.&#13;
so that the incremental cost recovery in PY1 would be in the range of 4-7%.&#13;
8.           Cash Flows. Revenues reflect existing fiscal revenues kept constant in real terms over&#13;
five years. This is based on the Bank staff projection of GDP growth becoming positive and staying so&#13;
from 1996. In addition, increased local tax revenues could be expected over project life (assuming at&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 3B                                                                             Page 56&#13;
least constant tax sharing rates between oblast and central Governments), as enterprises divest social&#13;
assets and are able to concentrate on their core productive functions. Tax sharing rates between central&#13;
and oblast governments have been assumed to be constant over project life, which is a conservative&#13;
assumption, given the national pattern of increasing local tax shares in recent years (e.g. Shymkent oblast&#13;
had its sharing rate on profits tax increased from 62% in early 1994 to 100% by mid-year). Existing&#13;
expenditures reflect current levels of spending kept constant over five years. Recurrent costs reflect the&#13;
portion financed by the Government as indicated above.&#13;
C. Overall Inventory of Social Assets&#13;
9.            The five project cities had a total of 372 social facilities of the types supported by the&#13;
project as of April 1995, of which 193 were owned by municipalities and oblast authorities and the rest&#13;
by enterprises. Table 3.b2 below provides the inventory of these assets:&#13;

10.           As a result of the continuing asset transfer, municipalities would have to manage a&#13;
significantly larger number of facilities than they operate currently. This would lead to a serious&#13;
management burden and a substantial increase in their budgetary requirements. The proposals under the&#13;
project provide for the transfer of 89 kindergartens, 5 polyclinics and 1 hospital. The remainder of&#13;
enterprise social assets would continue to be run by enterprises, or be closed, merged with other units&#13;
or privatized. These proposals reflect the ability of the cities to manage the additional facilities. Table&#13;
3b.3 gives a summary of the asset restructuring program.&#13;

D. Detailed City Inventories and Financing Plans&#13;
11.            Detailed proposals for each city in the two oblasts are provided below along with their&#13;
likely impact on finances of individual cities. Further data used in the preparation of the plans is&#13;
available in Working Document 4 for the project.&#13;
12.            Sustainability.  In each of the five localities divestiture of social assets would cause -&#13;
even with project support - emergence of a new financing gap in local budgets. Amounts were analyzed&#13;
and have been compared with several variables, such as: projected total local fiscal revenues; projected&#13;
additional revenues resulting from divestitures only; total recurrent costs of the to-be sustained facilities;&#13;
project financing of recurrent costs. Analysis shows that in the first two years none of the localities&#13;
experience severe difficulties in covering the gap. During Year 3 through Year 5 four of the five cities&#13;
(excluding Kentau) would be in a position to cover the gap without major problems. The deficit&#13;
expressed as a percentage of the total fiscal revenues varies from city to city. On average, it would&#13;
increase from 1 % in the third year to just over 2% in the fifth year. Options to close the deficit gap&#13;
include an increase in the level of cost recovery, an increase in the tax sharing rate of the oblasts, further&#13;
reduction in unit operating costs and more efficiency improvements.&#13;
13.           After the end of the proposed project, when the localities would need to finance not only&#13;
100% of recurrent costs but also critical supplies, two cities - Kentau and Pavlodar - would need to raise&#13;
their revenues significantly. In the case of Pavlodar, this is clearly feasible, due to the large size of the&#13;
city, its broad local fiscal base, and ample opportunities for private sector development. In the case of&#13;
Kentau, the situation is different and requires further analysis.&#13;
14.           Thus, with extensive and systematic rationalization of social services, managerial and&#13;
financial sustainability of services could be attained in all localities (with the possible exception of&#13;
Kentau). In each of the cities, significant net reductions of total social expenditures would take place&#13;
in the course of project implementation, thus diminishing pressure on local and central budgets. The main&#13;
conclusion from the analysis is that, while rationalization proposed under the project would be a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

challenging task, and would require substantial mobilization of additional revenues, sustaining the services&#13;
without the project would be untenable.&#13;
South Kazakhstan&#13;
(i) Shymkent City&#13;
15.           The three cities of South Kazakhstan participating in the pilot project are Shymkent,&#13;
Lenger and Kentau. Shymkent is the seat of the oblast administration and the largest city.  It has a&#13;
population of around 450,000. The city has a relatively diversified revenue base, with a range of large&#13;
manufacturing industries. In addition, it is the closest large town to Tashkent, with potential to benefit&#13;
from growing cross-border trade. Its social assets include 56 enterprise and 57 municipal kindergartens;&#13;
5 enterprise, 9 municipal, and 5 oblast polyclinics; and 15 municipal and 12 oblast hospitals. These&#13;
assets are summnarized in Table 3b.5.&#13;

16.           During the first year of project implementation, 30 enterprise kindergartens would be&#13;
transferred to the budget. It was agreed with local finance and education officials that 20 enterprise&#13;
kindergartens would not be transferred to the municipality as kindergartens (including 10 already closed&#13;
due to enterprise financial constraints). In addition, 6 existing municipal kindergartens in non-standard&#13;
buildings would be closed or converted to use for other purposes during the first year of the project. It&#13;
is estimated that two municipal and one oblast polyclinics, and 2 municipal and 3 oblast small specialist&#13;
hospitals could also possibly be closed and their activities merged with existing facilities by the end of&#13;
the project. Unit recurrent costs for transferred facilities would be standardized at the equivalent of&#13;
US$104/child/year for kindergartens, and US$624/staff/year for polyclinics. Details of these changes are&#13;
outlined in Table 3b.6.&#13;

17.          The investment and recurrent costs (including contingencies) resulting from these&#13;
measures for Shymkent are estimnated at US$13.9 million, of which US$9.5 million would be for&#13;
investments and US$4.4 million for recurrent costs. Details are summarized in Table 3b.7.&#13;

18.           The implementation of the transfer and restructuring program would result in a small&#13;
budget surplus for the city of less than 1 % of projected fiscal revenues for the first two years, a break-&#13;
even in the third year and a negligible deficit of less than 1 % over the last two project years, taking into&#13;
account the cost recovery measures proposed under the project, as shown in Table 3b.8.&#13;

19.          In addition to the assumptions shown in the table, the overall project common assumptions&#13;
have been used (Table 3b. 1). The Shymkent situation therefore appears manageable in the context of the&#13;
present tax sharing and transfer situation between the South Kazakhstan oblast and the central&#13;
government. Further, the average cost recovery rate over the life of the project is only about 8% of the&#13;
total relevant recurrent costs, rising from less than 5% in year 1 to about 13 % in year 5. City&#13;
administration officials are confident that this average is modest and could be increased.&#13;
(ii) Lenger&#13;
20.           Lenger has a population of 25,000. It is effectively a satellite town to Shymkent city.&#13;
Lenger's social assets consist of 2 enterprise and 11 municipal kindergartens; and 2 municipal hospitals.&#13;
These assets are summarized in Table 3b.9 below.&#13;

21.           During the first year of project implementation, the two enterprise-owned kindergartens&#13;
would be transferred to the local administration. Unit recurrent costs for transferred facilities would be&#13;
standardized at the equivalent of US$137/child/year for kindergartens. No facilities are expected to be&#13;
closed or merged.&#13;
22.           Total project costs (including contingencies) resulting from these measures for Lenger are&#13;
estimated at US$0.98 million, of which US$0.7 million would be for investments and US$0.28 million&#13;
for recurrent costs. Details are summarized in Table 3b. 10.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

23.          The impact of added social assets on the budget of the city would be negligible. The&#13;
implementation of the transfer and restructuring program would result in a small budget surplus, almost&#13;
a break-even, of 1-2% of projected fiscal revenues for the city over the life of the project, taking into&#13;
account the cost recovery measures proposed under the project, as shown in Table 3b. 11.&#13;

(iii) Kentau&#13;
24.          Kentau has a population of 66,000. Although it has several significant manufacturing&#13;
plants, the local economy is dominated by the Achpolymetall Combinat, which employs many people in&#13;
Kentau and Achisai, a mining town for which the municipality has administrative responsibility. In recent&#13;
years, the company has experienced financial difficulties, due to costly extraction techniques in the mines,&#13;
and the expenses of attempts to reorientate production. Kentau has 15 enterprise and 6 municipal&#13;
kindergartens, three municipal polyclinics, and 10 municipal hospitals. These assets are summarized in&#13;
Table 3b.12.&#13;

25.           During the first year of project implementation, seven enterprise-owned kindergartens are&#13;
expected to be transferred to the local administration. It is also proposed that at least 2 hospitals be&#13;
closed, privatized or merged over the life of the project. Unit recurrent costs for transferred facilities&#13;
would be standardized at the equivalent of US$137/child/year for kindergartens. Details of these changes&#13;
are sunmnarized in Table 3b. 13 below.&#13;

26.          Total project costs resulting from these measures for Kentau (including contingencies) are&#13;
estimated at US$4.1 million, of which US$2.5 million would be for investments and US$1.6 million for&#13;
recurrent costs. Details are summarized in Table 3b. 14.&#13;

27.           The impact of added social assets on the budget of the city would be significant even&#13;
when the restructuring and cost-saving measures have been implemented. Taking into account the cost&#13;
recovery measures proposed under the project (Table 3b. 15), the implementation of the transfer and&#13;
restructuring program would result in a budget deficit for the city of over 16% over the life of the&#13;
project, rising from about slightly more than 2% in year 1 to 30% of total fiscal revenues in year 5.&#13;

28.           In addition to the assumptions shown in the table, the overall project common assumptions&#13;
have been used. This level of deficit is problematic for a one company town like Kentau, whose&#13;
economic base has been declining. Under the project, a special effort would be made to explore&#13;
possibilities for further reducing the relatively high number of social assets when compared to the total&#13;
population, and cutting unit costs, which are substantially higher than elsewhere. However, these&#13;
measures alone might not be enough to put Kentau on a sound financial footing.9 The possibility of&#13;
budgetary assistance from the central government should be explored, based on the fact that Kentau&#13;
reportedly had approved a direct subvention representing 44% of the planned 1994 fiscal revenues.&#13;
The economic situation in Kentau is unusually difficult to predict in the medium term. The Government has proposed major&#13;
investments in the area to offset declining local mining employment (e.g. the establishment of a cotton ginning plant).&#13;

Pavlodar Oblast&#13;
(i) Pavlodar City&#13;
29.           The two participating cities in Pavlodar oblast are Pavlodar City and Aksu. Overall,&#13;
Pavlodar oblast has significantly higher average per capita incomes than South Kazakhstan, indicated by&#13;
the low share of local tax revenues that are returned to the oblast. Pavlodar City is the seat of the oblast&#13;
administration and the largest city. It has a population of 350,000, and a large and diversified industrial&#13;
base, though some major industries (e.g. the tractor factory) have experienced increasing economic&#13;
hardship in recent years. Its social assets include 84 enterprise and 31 municipal kindergartens; 1&#13;
enterprise, 4 municipal and 4 oblast polyclinics; and 2 enterprise, 6 municipal and 8 oblast hospitals.&#13;
These assets are summarized in Table 3b. 16 below.&#13;

30.           During the first year of project implementation, 23 enterprise-owned kindergartens would&#13;
be transferred to the budget. A further 10 kindergartens would be transferred in year 2. The remaining&#13;
kindergartens would continue to be run by enterprises, or be closed or merged with others during the life&#13;
of the project. There is also scope for reduction in the total number of hospitals, and for the closure of&#13;
at least one polyclinic by the end of the project. Unit recurrent costs for transferred facilities would be&#13;
standardized at the equivalent of US$101/child/year for kindergartens; US$798/staff/year forpolyclinics;&#13;
and US$844/bed/year for the hospitals. Details of these changes are summarized in Table 3b. 17.&#13;

31.          Total project costs (including contingencies) resulting from these measures for Pavlodar&#13;
are estimated at US$11.0 million, of which US$5.7 million would be for investments and US$5.3 million&#13;
for recurrent costs. Details are summarized in Table 3.18.&#13;

32.          The impact of added social assets on the budget of the city would be significant even&#13;
when the restructuring and cost-saving measures have been implemented. Taking into account the cost&#13;
recovery measures proposed under the project (Table 3b. 19), the implementation of the transfer and&#13;
restructuring program would result in a budget deficit of about 2% of projected fiscal revenues over the&#13;
&#13;

life of the project. The first two years would be a break-even. Then there would be a deficit of a just&#13;
over 2% in year 3 rising to more than 4% in year 5.&#13;

33.          In addition to the assumptions shown in the table, the overall project common assumnptions&#13;
have been used. This level of deficit is manageable in view of the present tax sharing and transfer&#13;
situation between Pavlodar oblast and the central government. Further, the average cost recovery rate&#13;
is only about 8 % of the total relevant recurrent costs. City administration officials are confident that this&#13;
average is modest and could be increased.&#13;
0ii) Aksu&#13;
34.          Aksu has a population of 55,000. It is effectively a satellite city to Pavlodar City. Aksu's&#13;
social assets consist of 13 enterprise and 5 municipal kindergartens; 2 municipal polyclinics; and 3&#13;
municipal hospitals. These assets are summarized in Table 3b.20.&#13;
Table 3b.20: Aksu Social Assets.&#13;

35.          During the first year of project implementation, three enterprise-owned kindergartens are&#13;
expected to be transferred to the local administration. An additional three kindergartens are programmed&#13;
to be transferred in year two. The remaining kindergartens would either remain with enterprises or be&#13;
closed/merged. There is also scope to merge the functions of one of the city hospitals into those of one&#13;
other by the later years of the project.  Unit recurrent costs for transferred facilities would be&#13;
standardized at the equivalent of US$137/child/year for kindergartens. Details of these changes are&#13;
summarized in Table 3b.21.&#13;

37.          Taking into account the cost recovery measures proposed under the project (Table 3b.23),&#13;
the implementation of the transfer and restructuring program would result in a budget deficit for the city&#13;
of slightly below 1 % over the life of the project, rising from a break-even in years 1 and 2 to just below&#13;
2% of total fiscal revenues in year 5. This deficit level is manageable.&#13;

E. Detailed city rationalization plans&#13;
Explanatory Notes to Rationalization Tables&#13;
38.           During project preparation, detailed rationalization plans were prepared for each city, to&#13;
assess the short term financing requirements for social services, and longer term fiscal sustainability.&#13;
These are set out in the following pages. The following notes explain the format and content of the tables.&#13;
Column 1:&#13;
Type of asset: kindergartens, polyclinics and hospitals.&#13;
Column 2:&#13;
Previous running costs: the current (before divestiture and rationalization) operating costs of&#13;
enterprises and municipal-owned facilities.&#13;
Column 3:&#13;
Recurrent cost: the cost to local governments, after they have unified the unit costs of ex-&#13;
enterprise and original municipal facilities.&#13;
Column 4:&#13;
Recurrent costs after savings: recurrent costs (column 3) adjusted each year for the effects of&#13;
rationalization (for example, privatization, management improvements) in the previous year. This&#13;
level of costs is used as a departure point for estimates of recurrent costs under the project. The&#13;
starting level of project support for these costs is 90%, declining on a yearly basis (column 9);&#13;
local co-financing (column 10) increases correspondingly.&#13;
Column 5:&#13;
Investment costs: the cost of medical supplies such as medicines, drugs, bandages, and other&#13;
consumables; also learning materials (books and art/music supplies) and medical supplies in&#13;
kindergartens (for immunization and emergency care).&#13;
Column 6:&#13;
Rehabilitation: the costs of rehabilitating of premises.&#13;
Column 7:&#13;
Total: the total of columns 4, 5 and 6.&#13;

Column 8:&#13;
Bank Projectfinancing - total: the share of the Bank's financing - x% of column 4 plus 100%&#13;
of columns 5 and 6.&#13;
Column 9:&#13;
Bank Projectfinancing- recurrent: financing of recurrent costs only, i.e. x% of positions of the&#13;
column 4, representing divested (ex-enterprise) facilities only.&#13;
Column 10:&#13;
Local financing - project: the balance of incremental funding to be provided by the local&#13;
government to help finance additional operating expenditures for the new, divested, facilities:&#13;
(1-x%) of those positions in column 4, representing divested facilities.&#13;
Column 11:&#13;
Local financing - total: total funds to be spent by local governments on operating costs of all&#13;
locally sustained public facilities. (columns 7 minus 8).&#13;
Column 12:&#13;
Fees and charges: cash inflows from fees and user charges.&#13;
Column 13:&#13;
Financing gap: the additional resources to be mobilized by each of the communities to ensure&#13;
sustainability of service delivery (columns 10 minus 12). The sources of financing gap could&#13;
include possible increases in collected taxes, introduction of new local taxes and charges, sales&#13;
of closed premises, leases of vacant lots, introduction of mandatory health insurance etc.&#13;
Column 14:&#13;
Additional revenues: projections of revenue increases, from a range of possible sources, including&#13;
raising of additional local revenues through commercial usage of the closed social facilities, and&#13;
commercial management of other properties.&#13;

SOCIAL PROTECTION PROJECT&#13;
ANNEX 3C. MONITORING AND EVALUATION OF SOCIAL SERVICES&#13;
1.           Project implementation would take place in an experimental setting with many unknown&#13;
factors including the administrative capacity of the cities. It is therefore advisable to provide a simple but&#13;
effective system for monitoring and evaluation so that progress and the effective utilization of project&#13;
resources can be properly followed and when problems are identified, measures can be put in place to&#13;
rectify the situation.&#13;
2.           The design of the monitoring and evaluation system to be used by the project would be&#13;
done by the technical assistance team in close association with the oblast and city administration officials.&#13;
A. Monitoring&#13;
3.           Monitoring would be carried out in four main areas: (i) the procurement and physical&#13;
delivery of goods; (ii) the physical implementation of project activities; (iii) the financial management and&#13;
control of project funds; and (iv) the institutional development under the project. A continuous&#13;
assessment of these activities would be carried out under the context of the implementation schedule and,&#13;
more specifically, the annual work programs.&#13;
4.           The monitoring function would use the project's Management Information System (MIS)&#13;
to be designed by the technical assistance team with the active participation of the implementation&#13;
agencies (oblasts and cities) and more specifically the Component Coordinators. The terms of referene&#13;
of the financial management and accounting experts include helping design the MIS by first malin a&#13;
thorough diagnostic of the existing budgetary and management systems of the cities and then makin&#13;
concrete recommendations on ways to adapt and supplement them.&#13;
5.     .     On the basis of the objectives and the implementation parameters included in the Ammal&#13;
Work Programs (AWP) and Budgets, the project would be monitored through well defined Performance&#13;
Monitoring Indicators (Annex 7) indicators that will be included in the quarterly and annual report to&#13;
be submitted to the oblast administrations, the PCU, the central Government and the Bank.  These&#13;
indicators are consistent with the references defined in the Project Implementation Schedule (Annex 9).&#13;
The following key indicators would be monitored:&#13;
(a)    Asset transfer&#13;
Number of assets or facilities transferred by nature and location&#13;
(b)    Restructuring&#13;
By nature of asset:&#13;
previous unit operating cost&#13;

B. Evaluation&#13;
6.            The relevance, performance, effectiveness, efficiency and impact of the project activities&#13;
within its stated objectives would be periodically evaluated using the monitoring data. The main purpose&#13;
of these evaluations would be to draw lessons from the experience gained and to adjust project design and&#13;
implementation accordingly.&#13;
7.           In addition to the normal on-going evaluation that is normally done in development&#13;
projects, the periodicity of other evaluation would be tailored to the special circumstances of both the&#13;
project and Kazakhstan. The first evaluation would take place six months after the start of effective&#13;
project implementation; the second one after one year; the third would be the mid-term evaluation and&#13;
the final would be ex-post.&#13;
C. Structure&#13;
8.           The data required for project monitoring would be gathered and processed by the&#13;
municipal financial and budgetary service staff with the assistance of the financial management and&#13;
accounting experts financed by the project in close association with the city CCs. There would be no&#13;
need therefore to create a special monitoring unit for the project. The evaluation function would be&#13;
carried out by the oblast CCs and the PCU.&#13;

ANNEX 3D. FLOW OF FUNDS FROM CENTRAL TO LOCAL BUDGETS&#13;
A. Existing Budgetary System&#13;
1.           The current budgetary and financial management system still retains many features of the&#13;
FSU system. Typically, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) requests from the oblasts proposals for the&#13;
coming year budgets in terms of expenditures and possible revenue generation. Based on these proposals,&#13;
the MOF allocates a budget to the oblast with broad guidelines on the allocation between different&#13;
expenditure categories. The oblast council then meets to determine the final make-up of the budget&#13;
among different categories within the ceiling assigned to them by the MOF. The final budget submitted&#13;
to and approved by Parliament has a budget entry only for the oblasts, not the cities.&#13;
2.           The oblast, like the MOF, allocates a budget amount to the cities or raions based on&#13;
proposals received from them. The city and raion councils, in turn, decide on how to allocate the funds&#13;
assigned to them between the different activities of their administration.&#13;
3.           A major aspect of the procedures briefly defined above is that both the cities and the&#13;
oblasts are not consulted on when the final decision is taken to allocate the budget amount to them. It&#13;
is therefore basically a top down approach. Another important feature is that most of the taxes used to&#13;
fund the budget are controlled by the central government which also decides each year the revenue or tax&#13;
sharing rate between the central government and the oblasts. The oblasts in turn determine the level of&#13;
tax sharing for the cities and raions. A third feature is the apparent lack of adequate coordination&#13;
between the process of establishing tax sharing rates on the one hand and the establishment and approval&#13;
of expenditures on the other at the oblast and city level. A final characteristic of the current system is&#13;
that the oblast is the focal point of budgetary and financial management at the regional level. The cities&#13;
have no direct relationship with the MOF and depend entirely on the oblast administration.&#13;
4.            Kazakhstan's budgetary and financial reporting mechanisms are not yet well known but&#13;
appear to be deficient in many ways. This is due in part to the delays in approving the budget and to&#13;
high inflation levels which require repeated budget revisions during the year. The 1994 budget for&#13;
instance was revised at least nine times and was only approved by Parliament in December 1994. Budget&#13;
reports for 1993 were not available at the end of November; it is therefore difficult to assess the budget&#13;
figures provided, a key element in determining how reliable and effective the funds flow mechanisms are.&#13;
B. Municipal Budgets&#13;
5.           The following table provides the 1994 budgets of the five cities under the project.&#13;
Miscellaneous revenues indicate non-recurrent taxes, fees or rates collected by the city. They are&#13;
unpredictable and change in nature from year to year. The figures otherwise show that the bulk of the&#13;
city revenues are from taxes controlled by the central government which are subsequently shared with&#13;
the cities on the basis of a tax-sharing rate set up each year. For most of the cities, these taxes represent&#13;
more than 70% of their revenues.&#13;

6.           The tax sharing rate is determined each year at the time the budget is being prepared and&#13;
voted by Parliament. It refers to the oblasts, not the cities. The oblast in turn sets the rates for the cities&#13;
within its territory. Once the rates have been adopted, the taxes to which they apply are collected locally&#13;
and deposited in a local bank account. Subsequently, a computation is done regularly on the amounts&#13;
collected that have to be transferred to the central budget and those that are to be kept at the oblast level&#13;
based on the tax sharing rates adopted. The same scenario is carried out between the oblasts and the&#13;
cities.&#13;
&#13;

ANNEX 3D                                                                          Page 87&#13;
C. Municipal Payment System&#13;
7.           Each city manages its own payment system. A city budget department accounts for all&#13;
receipts and manages all transfers for city goods and services. The budget department is required to keep&#13;
with the local branch of the National Bank (NBK) separate accounts for each major category of&#13;
expenditure. Below the city budget department are district budget offices whose numbers vary between&#13;
one and at least three depending of the size of the city. Each district office has two accounts with NBK&#13;
for each kindergarten: one for the transfers from the city and one for the payments made by parents.&#13;
Transfers from the city to the district accounts are made each month according to the budget estimates&#13;
made for the year on the basis of costs per kindergarten. These costs are based on the standard costs per&#13;
child.&#13;
8.           Payment for goods and services is effected as follows:&#13;
(a)    orders are placed for goods and services by the unit that needs them (either the&#13;
kindergarten or health facility);&#13;
(b)    after the service is provided or the goods are delivered, the invoices are approved and&#13;
certified;&#13;
(c)   the schools send their invoices for payment to the district budget office and the hospitals&#13;
directly to the city budget office; and&#13;
(d)    after verification for conformity, the district budget office orders a transfer to the&#13;
accounts of the suppliers while the city budget office orders a transfer of funds to the&#13;
account of the hospital.&#13;
D. Proposed Funds Flow Mechanisms&#13;
9.           Activities or items financed by the Bank would be paid in accordance with Bank&#13;
disbursement procedures utilizing the Special Account mechanism.&#13;
Special Accounts&#13;
10.          The difficult financial and budgetary situation of the Republic of Kazakhstan justifies the&#13;
need to ensure an adequate flow of foreign and local currency funds for the financing of the Bank's share&#13;
of eligible expenditures with a minimum of administrative delay. To that effect, provisions for advance&#13;
disbursements would be put in place as described below.&#13;
11.          To facilitate disbursements under the proposed loan, a Special Account (SA) has been&#13;
established in the National Bank of Kazakhstan in Almaty by the Ministry of Finance to cover the Bank's&#13;
share of eligible expenses in both local and foreign currencies. The PCU will be responsible for the&#13;
management of the SA. Project accounts will be opened at the NBK branches in Shymkent and Pavlodar&#13;
City, where the administration of project activities would be concentrated. Advances from the SA&#13;
equivalent to 90 day projected expenditures would be deposited in these branches to cover only the local&#13;
eligible Bank financed expenditures of the project. In deciding to employ the use of advances from the&#13;
SA, the following considerations would have to be taken into account:&#13;
(a)    as the implementing agencies will be scattered across the country, the location of the SA&#13;
in Almaty may create logistical problems for the smooth transfer of funds;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Page 88                                                                        ANNEX 3D&#13;
(b)   the borrower is unable to provide adequate working capital to project entities to&#13;
prefinance the Bank's share of expenditures; and&#13;
(c)   the borrower has the needed authority to enforce accounting controls over the advances&#13;
as well as the administrative capacity to manage the financial aspects of the project. This&#13;
capacity will be reinforced through the provision of technical assistance.&#13;
12.          The SA has been established and held in US dollars. The funds advanced to the project&#13;
accounts from the SA will be in local currency for the following reasons:&#13;
(a)    although the currency of the Republic of Kazakhstan is fully convertible, it is not a stable&#13;
currency and there is a significant foreign exchange risk;&#13;
(b)    advances into the project accounts will be exclusively for local expenditures;&#13;
(c)    NBK can provide daily, weekly or monthly statements.&#13;
13.          At the request of the Borrower, after Loan effectiveness, an amount equivalent to three&#13;
months of the Bank's share of the financing of eligible expenditures, mainly incremental recurrent costs,&#13;
would be deposited into the SA. Transfers in the local currency from the SA to the project accounts in&#13;
the oblasts would be made on the basis of approved estimated local expenditures for a 90 day period.&#13;
Project Accounts (PA)&#13;
14.          Simple local currency PAs would be opened at the city/district/MOL levels with 90 day&#13;
advance funds provided from the SA, thorough the 90-day accounts to be opened in each of the two&#13;
participating oblasts. These 90 day advance deposits would be made only upon presentation of a&#13;
statement of estimated amounts due based on current invoices and/or contractual provisions.&#13;
15.          Disbursements from the SA for the advances would be supported by a 90 day statement&#13;
of estimated expenditures. Replenishment of the SA would be supported by an SOE for those&#13;
expenditures agreed by the Bank or summary sheets for fully documented expenditures. Supervision&#13;
missions would inspect documentation retained by the borrower in the field. If ineligible expenditures,&#13;
including those not justified by the evidence furnished, or for amounts in excess of agreed disbursement&#13;
percentages, are financed from the SA, the Bank has the right to withhold further deposits into the SA.&#13;
The Bank may exercise this right until the borrower has: (a) refunded the amounts involved, or (b) (if&#13;
the Bank agrees) submitted evidence of other eligible expenditures that the Bank can use to offset the&#13;
ineligible amounts.&#13;
16.          After funds have been withdrawn from the SA, replenishment applications can be&#13;
submitted to the Bank at monthly intervals. Replenishments are requested by submitting Form 1903 with&#13;
the SOE and a statement of the SA from NBK, along with a reconciliation statement of the SA.&#13;
Statements of Expenditures (SOEs)&#13;
17.          For this loan, the Bank has agreed to accept SOEs for expenditures relating to all&#13;
incremental recurrent costs, expenditures under contracts for goods valued at less than $300,000&#13;
equivalent and expenditures under contracts for works valued at less than $100,000 equivalent.&#13;
Withdrawal applications, supported by SOEs, would be certified by the PCU and acceptable to the Bank&#13;
in form and content.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 3D                                                                         Pare 89&#13;
18.          The District office would submit SOEs to the city budget office after these statements had&#13;
been certified by the district office chief and head of the school department. The city budget office would&#13;
consolidate the SOEs from the districts and have them certified by the head of the city administration&#13;
before they are forwarded to the oblast where they would be certified by the head of the oblast and&#13;
transmitted to the PCU. The PCU would provide the official certification to the Bank when requesting&#13;
the replenishment of the SA.&#13;

request, review and consolidate the draft annual work programs and budgets from the oblast employment&#13;
services directors and the Almaty and Pavlodar city coordinators as appropriate for each of the main areas&#13;
of project activities. The Head of ES would clear these drafts before they are submitted to the PCU for&#13;
transmission to ministry where the PCU is located) and subsequently to the Ministry of Finance. They&#13;
would also request and review and consolidate progress and annual reports before sending them to the&#13;
Minister of Labor and the PCU.&#13;
7.           Social Services Component. The focal point of this component implementation would&#13;
be the city CCs. They would be responsible for the preparation of the annual work programs and budgets&#13;
and their implementation by the health and education services. The CCs would also help ensure that&#13;
adequate project accounts are established and that quarterly and annual progress reports are prepared.&#13;
At the oblast level, the CCs would be responsible for coordinating the planning and implementation of&#13;
project activities at the city level, consolidating the annual work programs and budgets and ensuring that&#13;
the project financing requirements are incorporated in the oblast budgets before they are sent to the PCU&#13;
and subsequently to the Ministry of Finance during the annual budget preparation process. They would&#13;
also review and consolidate the progress and annual reports before they are sent to the PCU.&#13;
C. Annual Work Programs and Budgets&#13;
8.           The project would be implemented through annual work programs (AWP).  The&#13;
preparation of the annual work program would follow the same timetable as the government budget cycle&#13;
(January Ist- December 31). The MOL CC would be responsible for coordinating the preparation of the&#13;
ES annual work programs and budgets by the directors of ES of the oblasts. These programs and budgets&#13;
would be submitted through the appropriate channels to the PCU.&#13;
9.           The city CCs would be responsible for the preparation of the AWP for the social assets&#13;
program of the city. This AWP would be submitted to the city council as part of the city budget for&#13;
approval. In the budget proposals, project activities would be clearly identified and set aside for easy&#13;
follow-up. The AWP approved by the city council would be forwarded to the oblast admninistration&#13;
through the oblast CCs who would consolidate all the AWPs from the cities reporting to that particular&#13;
oblast. The oblast council would then approve the consolidated AWP and forward them to the PCU.&#13;
The budget for the oblast would thus include two separate distinct broad sections: the normal budget&#13;
based on its current operations not taking project activities into consideration, and the budget specifically&#13;
related to project activities. This latter section would include the program of capital investments&#13;
(rehabilitation, equipment, supplies), and incremental recurrent costs for the project with a clear&#13;
indication of the financing sought for the incremental recurrent costs. The budget request would include&#13;
the additional budget required for current operations and the incremental recurrent costs.&#13;
10.          The PCU would review, approve and consolidate the AWPs received from MOL and the&#13;
oblasts. It would be responsible for submitting the consolidated AWP to the MOF for inclusion in the&#13;
national budget to ensure that appropriate allocations are made for the financing of the share of the project&#13;
incremental costs both for the ES and the Social Services components.&#13;
&#13;

estimation of the costs necessary to carry out the social assets program broken down into incremental&#13;
recurrent costs, non-incremental recurrent costs and rehabilitation, equipment and supplies costs per social&#13;
facility; (d) the proposed financing plan for the activities including local financing, World Bank financing&#13;
and, in the case of the social services program, revenues from user's fees.&#13;
12.          The AWPs would be submitted to the Bank for review and conmments at the same time&#13;
they are submitted to the PCU. The Bank would carefully review the submitted AWPs and make&#13;
commnents and recommendations as appropriate. The AWPs would the basis for the implementation of&#13;
project activities in any given year.&#13;
13.          Reporting requirements under the project would be as follows: quarterly progress reports&#13;
would be prepared and submitted not later than 30 days after the end of the quarter. They would include&#13;
information on the following:&#13;
(a)    a summary by component of project activities undertaken during the quarter;&#13;
(b)    a description of the main achievements and problems;&#13;
(c)    progress in the implementation of corrective measures identified the previous quarter;&#13;
(d)    a presentation of the financial situation of the project in terms of actual versus budget for&#13;
the major expenditure categories and the financing of the categories; and&#13;
(e)    a presentation of the financial situation of each component.&#13;
14.          At the end of the fiscal year, an annual report would be likewise prepared along the same&#13;
lines as the quarterly progress reports except that it would be more detailed and submitted no later than&#13;
45 days after the end of the year. The quarterly and annual reports would be prepared by the CCs for&#13;
each component. Their reports would in turn be consolidated with an introduction describing the major&#13;
achievements and problems being submitted to the PCU for final clearance. The reports cleared by the&#13;
PCU would be forwarded to the Bank.&#13;
15.          Separate accounts would be kept of project activities. At the end of the fiscal year, these&#13;
accounts would be audited by an independent auditing firm and forwarded to the Bank not later than six&#13;
months after the end of the fiscal year.&#13;

            Kazakstan - Social Protection Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Social Protection Project seeks to:
            1) develop the capacity of the Employment Service in the
            Department of Employment (DOE) of the Ministry of Labor
            (MOL) to manage the expected increase in the number of
            registered unemployed and attendant benefit claims following
            the restructuring and privatization of enterprises; and 2)
            ensure continued delivery of essential social services, by
            promoting orderly divestiture of social assets from
            enterprises, and efficient management by municipalities of a
            unified system of social services. To meet these objectives,
            the project has two main components: 1) an Employment
            Service (ES) Component to be implemented at both national
            and regional levels; and a Social Services Component, to be
            implemented in selected cities of South Kazakstan and
            Pavlodar oblasts. The Employment Service (ES) Component will
            strengthen the institutional capacity of the ES to register
            the unemployed and calculate and pay unemployment benefits;
            provide a more effective service to unemployed jobseekers;
            and analyze labor markets and formulate labor market
            policies. The Social Services Component will facilitate the
            transfer of essential social services from restructuring
            enterprises to local governments, and rationalize management
            of all basic services in five selected cities : Shymkent
            City, Kentau, Lenger, Pavlodar City, and Aksu.
