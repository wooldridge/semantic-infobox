OLIVER:    May   we begin our conversation by   my   asking you to say a word      Bank's A building.     At that time the Fund was in the same building.&#13;
&#13;
about how you heard about the Bank and came to the Bank in the first               The Bank was expanding very rapidly then, although most of the concern&#13;

place.    Perhaps you would say a bit about your background in economics.          was with with reconstruction loans to European countries that had been&#13;
&#13;
GILMARTIN:    Well my background in economics was primarily at the                 devastated by the war.&#13;
&#13;
University of California where I studied as a graduate student and                 OLIVER:     I assume your background of working in Japan was a factor in&#13;
&#13;
received a Ph.D.      From there, I went into the Army.       I was in the Army    their being interested in you.&#13;
&#13;
for about 3 years with the anti-aircraft artillery until I was                     GILMARTIN:     Well. it may have been.    I had the impression that anybody&#13;
&#13;
transferred to milit8ry government and. after the-Armistice, was sent              who had spent any time in any part of Asia qualified for being in that&#13;
&#13;
to Japan where I was involved in same economics work.          I was in the        part of the Bank.     This was before Japan became involved with the Bank.&#13;

&#13;
on the faculty at Ann Arbor suggested that I try the World Bank. end so            all the economic missions that the Bank sent to Japan,&#13;
&#13;
I came to Washington and applied and in October 1946 began as a Junior             OLIVER:     Were you in the beginning concerned primar1ly with loans --&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
GILMARTIN:     My function was mainly that part of operations concerned          operations talk very much with people who were left in the Economics&#13;
with assessments of Japan's creditworthiness. which wasn't as clear              Department--people like Paul Rosenstein-Roden who were concerned with&#13;

OLIVER:    Were you ever in the Research Department under Leonard Rist7          GILMARTIN:     At least in my experience. I don't th1nk there was too much&#13;

one was the Research Department and the other was the Loan Department.           been familiar to people--such things as "terms of trade" which many&#13;
These departments were later re-constituted        into regional and country     bank economists had never heard of at that point.      He was&#13;
departments and divisions.        At that point. I was assigned to the Asia      instrumental in that sort of thing.      There was something called the&#13;
Department.     I was involved first with India and Pakistan and then            Staff Economic Committee. which at that time consisted of economists&#13;
later mainly with Japan and Thailand.                                            representing the regional departments.      Every economic report at that&#13;
OLIVER:    After the Reorganization of '52. I assume. even                       time had to be reviewed by the Economic Committee. and that comm1ttee&#13;
creditworthiness studies were done by economists in the various area             also heard from people like Rosenstein-Roden and others who were&#13;
departments.                                                                     involved in broader economic considerations.      It got a good deal of&#13;
GILMARTIN:     Right.     The loan functions and the economic functions had      guidance from them in that respect.&#13;
been separated.       Then they were consolidated into regional divisions.       OLIVER:   One of the things that Rosenstein-Roden was famous for in the&#13;
which included "all aspects" of dealings with a particular country.              Bank was arguing for more lending that might be categorized as balance-&#13;
(When I say all aspects. I mean essentially the loan functions. the              of-payments as distinct from project lending. but he was never&#13;
technical project functions. and the economic functions.          Of course.     successful while at the Bank in making that stick.&#13;
the legal aspects and some other aspects were separate.)          That was the   GILMARTIN:     That's right.   He did develop a concept that was known as&#13;

&#13;
GILMARTIN:   Oh. yes. that's right. but with quite a difterent              World Bank's representative;       I had access to the Minister and the&#13;

rationale.                                                                  Ministry of Finance and met with them frequently.       We talked about&#13;

GILMARTIN:   I lived in Thailand for about two and a half years at a        one of its so-called economic survey missions.        The Bank did several of&#13;
&#13;
time when the Bank was first starting to operate there.    We had           those in the early days.       They involved large teams of people to assist&#13;

friendly relations with the Thais.    They were very much interested in     countries in the formulation of their development plans.       Host of these&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
to put conditions on lending in Thailand which probably today no            mission was there for a little over a year.      These mission reports were&#13;

OLIVER:   So policy recommendations made by the Bank about macroeconomic    As soon as it began to prepare these country reports. which implied&#13;

issues such as interest rates and rates of savings. that sort of th1ng.     certain policies that ought to be carried out. the Bank was       becomin~&#13;

really go back quite a long time in the Bank don't they?                    concerne~    with development and using its own facilities to recommend&#13;
&#13;
GILMARTIN:   Yes.   I think that in some of the East Asian countr1es.       policies consistent with development.&#13;
&#13;
these sorts of recommendations were fairly common.    Not all of them       GILMARTIN:     That's right.   These reports did emphasize macroeconomic&#13;
&#13;
were as receptive as the Thais. but I recall that the Bank in its early     policies. mainly in finance to the eXtent that information and&#13;
&#13;
days ran a lengthy seminar in Washington for the Phillipines at which       expertise were available in that area.      They were also very much&#13;

OLIVER:   When you were concerned with Thailand. were you a major           OLIVER:     In the early days of the bank. there was some dichotomy&#13;
&#13;
advisor on these kinds of issues?                                           between people like Rosenstein-Roden. on the one hand. and economists&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
like yourself who were engaged in operations. on the other hand.        Did     GILMARTIN:     Well. I think they did that anyway.   Black was quoted at&#13;
&#13;
this dichotomy continue in the Bank over the years?                             one time as feeling that economists were necessary for some reason. but&#13;

GILMARTIN:     Yes, very much so.   This was all background to the Bell       and Investment Corporation of India.     He made several trips to India&#13;

OLIVER:     Before I ask you specifically about the Bell Mission. let me      is that India was certainly a major thrust of the Bank.     Prior to the&#13;

how the Bank's concern with India compared with the Bank's concern          Steel was a big area of Bank financing, and almost all of the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
about some of the South American countries. Brazil for instance. which      loans had conditions about debt-to-equity limits that Japan had agreed&#13;
&#13;
were also problems. but it was a pretty major concern of the Woods'         to observe, but every year when there would be a delegation from Japan&#13;

&#13;
OLIVER:   I think. perhaps. I shifted our coaversation too soon to          more in keeping with Japan's practices.    Almost always the Bank gave in&#13;
&#13;
India. Are there things you want to add to what you already have said       on that subject, which I think speaks well of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
about Thailand or Japan from your own personal experiences1                 OLIVER:   Well. the Japanese economy is a somewhat different economy.&#13;
&#13;

concern that Japan itself would ever be creditworthy.    They were          with connections with the banks and so on.&#13;
&#13;
considered eligible for Bank financing mainly on the strength of the                  The other big disagreements that the Bank always had with Japan&#13;
&#13;
fact that the u. S. stood behind them, but the prospects didn't look        was over international competitive bidding.    The Japanese would always&#13;
&#13;
very good at all.    Then of course things moved along, and. from almost    insist that contracts had to be given to Japanese contractors.     Even&#13;
&#13;
the mid '50s on, there was no question about Japan's credicworthiness.      after they backed down on that, they would usually make sure that even&#13;

It was obvious where they were going.    In fact, from the time of the      though they had international competitive bidding, Japanese contractors&#13;

disagreements between the Bank and Japan on project problems.    The        also.&#13;

should.     In the second place. they didn't like the idea of foreigners           CLIVER:    His presidency ended April 1st. 1968. so perhaps very early in&#13;
coming in and developing their fertilizer industry. As a result. th1s              1&#13;
                                                                                       68.&#13;
&#13;
fertilizer idea never really got off the ground.      Woods was quite put          GILMARTIN:      Well. this was at a time when UNCTAD was having its&#13;
&#13;
out that the Indian government was not more receptive. so th1s was                 five-year conference in India.      I guess it was in the spring of '68. I&#13;
&#13;
another aspect of ill feeling on his side. as well as the Indian                   know it was at a time when Woods was about to leave the Bank. and&#13;
&#13;
government's ill feeling about devaluation and foreign aid.                        McNamara would be taking over.     Woods was to give an address to the&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    I take it that. at least in the case of India. George Woods as          UNCTAD conference. which he did. and the Indian government took great&#13;
&#13;
President Â·of the Bank became personally involved in a fair number of              umbrage with what he had to say.      It didn't seem to me that their&#13;
negotiations so that it was almost as if he were his own loan officer?             attitude was justified.&#13;
&#13;
GU.MARTIN:      Well. he was certainly much involved in details of Indian                       His speech was one in support of more aid to developing&#13;
&#13;
operations.      I don't know whether he actually became involved in loan          countries. and be referred especially to India and said that. because&#13;
&#13;
negotiations. but he certainly gave any activity in India more                     of the decline in aid India was getting fran abroad. ''Hope was turning&#13;
&#13;
attention than probably he gave most other countries.                              to despair.â&#128;¢â&#128;¢     The Indian government took great objection to this&#13;
OLIVER:    Did you ever have an opportunity to talk to Woods personally            statement on the grounds that India was not so dependent on aid that&#13;
&#13;
about his attitudes toward India and the Indian government?                        they would despair without it. That India would "despair" over aid&#13;
&#13;
GU.MARTIN:      Well. only at second hand.   It was after his second India         levels from one year to another was ridiculous,&#13;
&#13;
mission that Bernie Bell was telling Woods about the mission and the                          I was the representative from the Bank in India at the time,&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  19                                                                                20&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
and I went to the Finance Ministery to discuss this problem.     I told      OLIVER:   The fertilizer plant incident occurred in something like '66,&#13;
&#13;
them I thought they were making a huge fuss out of a matter that I           I take it, at least two years before the UNCTAD meeting that you had&#13;
&#13;
couldn't see had that much significance and that certainly no dig was        been describing. The dates are not crucial. but I'm trying to establish&#13;
&#13;
intended.     I mentioned what a good friend Woods had been to India over    that there was a hiatus during which this ill will continued.          It&#13;
&#13;
his whole period from the time he     was involved with the iron and steel   wasn't a continual thing:     the fertilizer business happening one month&#13;
&#13;
loan and so ono                                                              and the UNcrAD speech happening the next month, so to speak.&#13;
&#13;
          Tbe Indians were simply adamant and said that they noticed that    GILMARTIN:   Well, let's see.    It was in   1   65 and in '66 that the big&#13;
&#13;
Woods never missed a chance to make a slighting remark about India.          droughts took place.    It was in that period that India was on the&#13;
&#13;
This wasn't true.     It was true that. at that particular time. he had      short-leash policy of the U. s. as far as AID was concerned.          I'm not&#13;
&#13;
gotten pretty sour on India over this agriculture business. but over         too clear on this.     I think there was first the Bell Mission report.&#13;
&#13;
the long run he bad been one of their strong supporters.     I tried to      then the Bechtel fertilizer business, and then the fact that India&#13;
&#13;
persuade them that they were being rather childish on this. but I got        didn't get a continuation of the consortium aid they had been&#13;
&#13;
no place. and in the printed version of the speech. they insisted that       expecting.   (Woods said that he had never committed himself to more&#13;
&#13;
some kind of disclaimer by Woods be added to the printed copy.               than one year of increased consortium aid.)         Finally there was the&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Was that done?                                                   drought and the shortage of aid from the U. S. which some Indians&#13;
&#13;
GILMARTIN:     Yes. I think it was.                                          thought Woods had a band in.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Would you guess that this was really due to his words. or was    OLIVER: Â· Did relations between the Bank and India subsequently improve?&#13;
&#13;
it in part because he had had some personality differences with some         Or is India to this day still slighty sour about the Bank?&#13;
&#13;
people in the Indian government at an earlier time--perhaps at the time      GILMARTIN:   Well, I went there in '67 at a time when feelings were&#13;
&#13;
of the Bechtel fertilizer plant business?                                    rather strained. We were subject to their being very sensitive about&#13;
&#13;
Gll.HARTIN:    My impression was that a number of people in the government   anything we might say or that we might report with their knowledge to&#13;
&#13;
were looking for same reason to take a shot at Woods. which I think          the Bank, but that sort of ill will didn't appear to last very long.&#13;
&#13;
simply reflected a continuing ill feeling about him.     They seemed to      It was fed a bit at that time by a particular project that the Indians&#13;
&#13;
have the feeling that Woods had turned against them, and they certainly      were putting great stock in--a project to build a lot of tube wells in&#13;
&#13;
had turned against Woods.                                                    Northern India.   They felt the Bank was pretty well set to go ahead on&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  21                                                                           22&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
this. and then. somewhere along the line. the Bank decided to pull out       India than the Indians expected.     A delegation came to Washington from&#13;
of the business.     That didn't help relationships for awhile.   I th1nk    India for some other reason--! forget whether it was an Annual Meeting&#13;
from. say. '69 on. Bank-Indian relations got to be reasonably good.          or for some other purpose--but, anyway, they came back to report that&#13;
OLIVER:   Maybe you'll comment about Mr. McNamaraâ&#128;¢ s relations with the      they were going to get all that they had hoped for at the beginning:&#13;
Indian government.                                                           they said that when they discussed this with McNamara. it was like&#13;
GILMARTIN:   Yes.    He was always very sympathetic toward India and         leaning against an open door.&#13;
toward their programs.     He caae in after the all-out heavy                OLIVER: That leads me to ask an organizational question about the Bank.&#13;
industralization program had been dropped.     He also came in after the     Does it often happen that the President of the Bank negotiates&#13;
droughts were over and the Green Revolution was going ahead very             personally with member governments, that his personal decision has a&#13;
favorably.   There wasn't as much for him to be too upset about in India     great deal to do with whether the Bank decides to be lenient or&#13;
except that the Bank has always been upset about India's restrictive         friendly, so to speak, on the one hand, or tough, on the other hand1&#13;
policies toward private enterprise and trade.                                GILMARTIN:     I think that is not at all uncommon in the Bank.   It was&#13;
OLIVER:   For their part. the Indian negotiators. when they called upon      probably particularly true with McNamara. who really operated a highly&#13;
Hr. McNamara, found him sympathetic1                                         centralized organization.    With his capacities, he could take an&#13;
GILMARTIN:   Yes, they did find him sympathetic.    He set what really was   interest in an enormous amount of detail, which he did.     This was&#13;
a ne.w policy for the bank:    that the Bank would be willing to make        certainly the case in India.     I think it was also the case in a number&#13;
loans to government enterprises, which had not been a Bank practice.         of other countries.     Of course, he had to be concerned with the&#13;
OLIVER: Government enterprises in industry1                                  reactions of the Board, and they were never vety enthusiastic about&#13;
GILMARTIN:   Yes.    He was also sympathetic to their need for free          non-project lending.&#13;
exchange and for non-project loans.     There was a limit to how far you     OLIVER:    I should have thought that he would have been concerned about&#13;
could go in that respect, I guess, because of the considerations of the      the reaction of the staff, too.     The staff spends a long time worrying&#13;
Board, but India did get away with more non-project financing with           about projects and doing the analysis necessaty to go into development&#13;
fewer conditions than was true of most other countries.     I remember one   work.     I should have thought it would be discouraging suddenly to&#13;
occasion when the Bank concluded because of policy differences, that         discover that the President had either vetoed what they had&#13;
there was going to be a much smaller amount of financing available to        recommended, on the one hand, or gone over their heads to approve&#13;
&amp;#12;'&#13;
&#13;
                                                                      23                                                                                24&#13;

&#13;
    GILMARTIN:   Well, in this particular case, I think the staff found     th~s             There is another aspect of this which is that somewhere along&#13;
&#13;
    somewhat awkward.    They had told the Indians what the situation was,         the line--! guess this was in the McNamara period--the Bank decided to&#13;
&#13;
    and then McNamara decided otherwise.    On the whole, the operational          finance the local currency parts of some projects.       That meant free&#13;
&#13;
    staff was fairly sympathetic toward non-project lending.      This was less    exchange for the country concerned. but this was done on a fairly&#13;
&#13;
    true of the Projects Department.    At that time, the Projects Department      limited scale and on a case-by-case basis.     I don't   th~nk   there has&#13;
&#13;
    and the area departments were separate.    The Projects Department never       been any strong move in the free-exchange direction until recently with&#13;
&#13;
    took too kindly to the notion of non-project lending while the area            the structural adjustment type of operations.&#13;
&#13;
    depar~ents   on the whole were favorable to it.                                OLIVER:     I can think of one other question about India and the period&#13;
&#13;
    OLIVER:   It seems to me as a generalization, going back over the              we are talking about.     I think it is true that in the middle '60s the&#13;
&#13;
    history of the Bank, that most non-project lending has been to                 Congress of the United States was somewhat critical of IDA&#13;
&#13;
    countries which have a track record of managing their development              replenishment requests. in part of the grounds that a large part of IDA&#13;
&#13;
    programs reasonably well.    This was certainly true of the                    money was going to India and India seemed to be a country which was&#13;
&#13;
    reconstruction lending to France and countries like that.      It was true     not exactly pro American in its attitudes.     Did this consideration&#13;
&#13;
    of Australia early in the history of the Bank. and. I take it. it must         about IDA come to your attention and    pl~   any part in the thinking of&#13;
&#13;
    have been true of Japan. so that the emphasis on project      lending~!!       the Bank people involved in dealing with the Indian govertunent'l&#13;
&#13;
    is probably more important in the case of countries that do not have an        GILMARTIN:    Well. it certainly came to my attention. but I think the&#13;
&#13;
    established development pattern.                                               Bank stood fairly independent of Congress in this respect.         I know&#13;
&#13;
    GILMARTIN:   With regard to Japan. I don't think the Bank ever made any        every time the IDA replenishment came up. one of the main objections&#13;
&#13;
    non-project loans.    They were all for projects.   The amount of non-         was that too much money was going to India.     At one time. there was a&#13;
&#13;
    project financing that the Bank has done has been a very small part of         wag's remark that IDA stood for the Indian Development Association.&#13;
&#13;
    the total. and it's been the policy (rather leniently applied to India)        But I think the IDA replenishment. after considerable negotiation.&#13;
&#13;
    to limit this to cases in which there are clear and satisfactory               until very recently. usually came through and that India got what it&#13;
&#13;
    conditions that the Bank bas reviewed and has found acceptable.        Then    expected out of it. which came to be established at 40 percent.&#13;
&#13;
    is willing to make available some small part of their financing in free        OLIVER:     It is of course well less than 40 percent today.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                  25                                                                         26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GILMARTIN:   Oh. yes.                                                     about that we   haven't talked about?&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Do you know today how the Indian government feels about th1s?   GILMARTIN:   It seems to me that we have pretty well covered what I&#13;
&#13;
Are the Indians now over the hump. so to speak. so that they don't need   might have to say.   1 1 m sorry that 1 1 m not more familiar with the&#13;
&#13;
a large percentage of the IDA total?                                      details of Woods 1 regime. which is your primary interest.     It was only&#13;
&#13;
GILMARTIN:   I only know about this from hearsay. which is that they're   when I got involved with India. because of his considerable&#13;
&#13;
not very happy about the fact that they are getting a greatly reduced     involvement. fairly late in his term as far the East Asia is concerned.&#13;
&#13;
proportion of a smaller IDA. but that's about as much as I know about     I don't remember any problems or any aspects of the relationship of the&#13;
&#13;
that.                                                                     East Asia Department with Woods and with his regime that were notable.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   How about the implication that the Indian development program   OLIVER:   I was told a story about Thailand which is worth repeating&#13;
&#13;
is doing well.   The Indians do not have a heavy foreign debt relative    and inducing you to comment on.    During the Viet Nam War. when&#13;
&#13;
to exports the way the Brazilians do.   They are in better shape with     Thailand had a great deal of foreign exchange and was in some sense. on&#13;
&#13;
respect to development now than they were twenty years ago.               that account. less eligible for Bank or IDA loans than it had been&#13;
&#13;
GILMARTIN: Well. I think. as I have been told of the situation now.       earlier. a person from the Bank was in Thailand to talk to Thai&#13;
&#13;
that what you state is true.   Let me put it another way.   The           officials; and one of the Thai officials said. "Even though we may not&#13;
&#13;
financial markets now consider India a fairly good credit risk since      be eligible for loans. we very much hope that-you will continue to&#13;
&#13;
its foreign debt is small. it's repayment record is very good. and I      make them. because the   w~   in which the Bank supervises its operat1ons&#13;
understand that India doesn't have any trouble borrowing in the market.   in Thailand is very instructive to the Thai government.      It would be&#13;
&#13;
In that sense. India is less dependent on concessional aid than they      deleterious from the point of view of our having standards for our own&#13;
&#13;
were at one time.   I don't think this makes the Indians any happier--    operations if the Bank were to cease its lending all together."          Can I&#13;
&#13;
having to pay commercial rates for money as compared to the rates that    make a question out of that story?&#13;
&#13;
they might have gotten if IDA money were more plentiful.                  GILMARTIN:   Well. that's true.   I'm trying to remember the details.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:   Well. sir. I have been very selfish in my questions.    I've    Thailand persuaded the Bank to make a loan even though it didn't&#13;
&#13;
been asking things that happen to fit in with mf own frame of             involve any net transfer of funds.      I guess Thailand agreed to buy an&#13;
&#13;
reference.   Let me ask you in general. What kinds of things you would    equivalent amount of Bank bonds or something of that sort.&#13;
&#13;
like to have me ask you?   What kinds of things would you like to talk    OLIVER:   I think that's right.    I think it is very interesting that the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                      27&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
credibility of Bank operations was so high that the Thai government&#13;
&#13;
wanted to continue to have the Bank involved in Thailand even though.&#13;
&#13;
in some sense. Thailand didn't need Bank money.&#13;
&#13;
Gn.MARTIN:     I think the Batik was very pleased about that operation.&#13;
&#13;
but. as I mentioned earlier. the Bank's relations with Thailand have&#13;
&#13;
always been extreaely good.         Like most developing countries. the Th&amp;l.&#13;
&#13;
administration ianâ&#128;¢ t all that cohesive.        Thailand is a country with an&#13;
&#13;
accepted standard of corruption. and so iaportant people in the&#13;
&#13;
government liked the idea of the Bank's exercising some kind of&#13;
&#13;
influence for greater cohesion among the agencies of the government and&#13;
&#13;
also to keep the corruption down to a reasonable level.&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     I think that is a happy story with which to end our&#13;
&#13;
conversation today. unless there is something you are particularly&#13;
&#13;
anxious to add.&#13;
&#13;
GILMARTIN:     No.   I've enjoyed this very much.&#13;
