ABSTRACT&#13;
With the input-output tables of the U.N. world model, by&#13;
themselves and in conjunction with data derived from regression equations&#13;
for production in an average country, it is possible to elicit some average&#13;
patterns of employment associated with rising levels of per capita income.&#13;
These average patterns neglect differences in country size, resource&#13;
endowment, foreign trade, and development strategy. They nevertheless&#13;
can provide some indication of the effect of investment in a given&#13;
sector on employment in that sector and in the entire economy.&#13;

OVERVIEW&#13;
In what sector will a given investment generate the most employment? Because&#13;
the resources for investment are very-limited in many developing countries,&#13;
the question has been impcortant to planners, economists, and policymakers for&#13;
some time. The method typically used in an attempt to answer this question&#13;
has been to estimate ratios of labor to output, capital to output, and labor&#13;
to capital for various incdustrial sectors or subsectors. What these measures&#13;
lack, however, is the ability to capture the impact of investment on employ-&#13;
ment elsewhere in the ecornomy. This shortcoming is significant, because the&#13;
expansion of one sector's output calls for increases--often substantial&#13;
increases--in the output and employment of other sectors supplying inter-&#13;
mediate inputs.&#13;
Input-output anULlysis is one method that enables estimating the&#13;
economywide effects of an expansion in output by a given sector. It requires,&#13;
however, fully articulated tables of interindustry transactions, and these&#13;
exist for only a small nutiber of developing countries. It will be a long time&#13;
before such tables are constructed for all developing countries. In the mean-&#13;
time the fully articulatecl tables of the U.N. world model are available for&#13;
thirty industrial sectors, fifteen regions, and eight levels of per capita&#13;
income. These data present an opportunity to show some of the applications of&#13;
input-output analysis to the problems of employment in a developing economy.&#13;
With these tables, by themselves and in conjunction with data&#13;
derived from regression equations for production in an average country,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
it is possible to elicit some average patterns of employment associated with&#13;
rising levels of per capita income. The patterns are, it must be stressed,&#13;
average patterns that neglect differences in country size, resource endowment,&#13;
foreign trade, and development strategy. They nevertheless can provide some&#13;
indication of the effect of investment in a given sector on employment in that&#13;
sector and in the entire economy.&#13;
Four findings are of particular interest. First, because of the&#13;
changing composition of production at rising levels of per capita income, the&#13;
share of labor becomes greater in the technologically advanced sectors, and&#13;
capital also shifts toward those sectors. Second, the generally held belief&#13;
is confirmed that labor requirements decline in relation to capital require-&#13;
ments and to output as an economy moves to successively higher levels of per&#13;
capita income. Third, because of the interindustry linkages arising from&#13;
increases in the demand for intermediate inputs, the requirements of labor&#13;
outside a sector called upon to expand output are in many instances substan-&#13;
tial. It thus is possible that a given investment in a capital-intensive&#13;
sector will generate more employment throughout the economy than will invest-&#13;
ment in a labor-intensive sector. Fourth, the strengthening of interindustry&#13;
linkages offsets to an increasing degree the adverse effect on employment of&#13;
the declining labor requirements in relation to output--at least for the most&#13;
technologically advanced sectors at the higher levels of per capita income.&#13;
That adverse effect is greatest in the metals, chemicals, and machinery&#13;
sectors, precisely the sectors whose output expansion causes the sharpest&#13;
increase in the requirements for labor elsewhere in the economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
Economic development has historically been accompanied by a relative shift of&#13;
employment from agriculture to manufacturing (Kuznets 1966). This pattern&#13;
reflects many simultaneous effects.   The abundant supply of labor, in part&#13;
released from the agricultural sector, permits industrial output to expand&#13;
rapidly. Concurrently the higher productivity in the various manufacturing&#13;
sectors raises the wages of those employed in the modern sector, and these&#13;
higher wages draw labor from agriculture (Madison 1970; Stern 1976).&#13;
In manufacturing, development is accompanied by changes in the&#13;
output composition of various industries and by changes in technology, which&#13;
influence the labor intensity of various processes. At rising levels of&#13;
per capita income, the relative contributions of various manufacturing&#13;
activities to the economy's output change, reflecting changes in the demand&#13;
for finished and intermediate products. For example, the relative demand&#13;
by consumers for textiles may decline as incomes rise, but an increase in&#13;
the demand by other producers for textiles may offset this decline. 1/ In&#13;
addition, there is a general trend for industrial activities to become less&#13;

1/ This pattern assumes i:hat the elasticity of the demand for textiles in&#13;
relation to the level of per capita income is less than one, but that&#13;
sufficient interindust:ry demand for textiles is created through rapid&#13;
input substitution, through the expansion of production by textile-&#13;
using producers, or through both.&#13;

labor-intensive: that is, to require less labor per unit of output (Leontief&#13;
and others 1977; Stern 1976). Thus the growth and changing structure of&#13;
industrial employment are consequences of many factors. Some of these factors&#13;
increase the demand for labor; others reduce it.&#13;
In this paper we attempt to analyze the changing structure of indus-&#13;
trial employment associated with increasing levels of per capita income and&#13;
to identify the various sources of growth of employment in a simulated eco-&#13;
nomy that is moving to successive levels of per capita income. The analysis&#13;
illustrates some of the uses of input-output techniques in manipulating data&#13;
related to the factors presumed to cause changes in industrial employment.&#13;
The results of this analysis, however, are at best an indication of average&#13;
patterns, given the rather strong assumptions on which the data and analysis&#13;
are based.&#13;
The first section, intended for readers not familiar with input-&#13;
output analysis, presents some basic terms and concepts. The second section&#13;
describes the sources and manipulations of data used in this study. The&#13;
third section analyzes changes in the economywide structure of employment and&#13;
capital use. The fourth section examines the sources of change in employment&#13;
in relation to final demand, sector by sector, at successive levels of per&#13;
capita income. The fifth section summarizes the findings and speculates about&#13;
the direction input-output analysis must follow if it is to become a more&#13;
useful tool for determining the employment impact of alternative investments.&#13;
I.  CONCEPTS AND TERMS OF INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS&#13;
An input-output table of an economy summarizes the transactions of goods and&#13;
services by origin and by destination. To summarize the transactions by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
origin, the value of output by each industry is separated into three basic&#13;
categories: the value of intermediate inputs purchased from various indus-&#13;
tries, the payments to primary factors of production (labor and capital),&#13;
and the payments to government (indirect taxes less subsidies). To summarize&#13;
the transactions by destination, the supply of goods and services by each&#13;
industry is separated into deliveries to industries as intermediate inputs&#13;
(intermediate demand) and deliveries to exports, investment, and private and&#13;
government consumption (final demand). 1/&#13;
The part of the input-output table showing each industry's purchases&#13;
from and deliveries to other industries constitutes a table of interindustry&#13;
transactions. It reveals the linkages created by purchases (in columns) and&#13;
deliveries (in rows) between industries: that is, the interindustry linkaRes.&#13;
From the interindustry table it is a simple matter to calculate the amounts&#13;
of various intermediate inputs an industry must purchase from itself and from&#13;
other industries to produce a unit, or dollar's worth, of output.&#13;
The relative amount of inputs directly required in an industry by a&#13;
unit increase in its outpult is described by the direct input-output coeffi-&#13;
cient, which is obtained by dividing the value of each intermediate input by&#13;
the value of output. When an industry expands output, it usually requires&#13;
additional intermediate inputs from other industries that supply it. The&#13;
output and corresponding intermediate input requirements of those industries&#13;
increase as well, as do the output and corresponding input requirements of&#13;
industries supplying inputs to those industries, and so on. Those additional&#13;
1/ The algebra associated with the general statements in this section is&#13;
presented in appendix A. For an introduction to interindustry analysis,&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
input requirements are construed as inputs indirectly required by the industry&#13;
first expanding its output in response to an increase in final demand. The sum&#13;
of all these repercussions is described by a matrix of inverse coefficients--&#13;
the Leontief inverse matrix--which shows the adjustments in output each&#13;
industry must make directly and indirectly (through interindustry linkages) in&#13;
response to a unit increase in final demand for some industry's output. The&#13;
coefficients constituting that matrix consequently can be called total input-&#13;
output coefficients: that is, direct-plus-indirect input-output coefficients.&#13;
With the interindustry matrix and data on employment and capital&#13;
stock by industry, it is possible to calculate, for a given increase in an&#13;
industry's output, the additional amounts of labor and capital directly&#13;
required by that industry (the direct effect) and by all industries (the&#13;
direct-plus-indirect effect or the total effect). The direct labor and&#13;
capital requirements are described by the direct labor and capital coeffi-&#13;
cients, which are the conventional labor-output and capital-output ratios.&#13;
The total labor and capital requirements are the sum of additional labor and&#13;
capital requirements in all industries that make adjustments in output in&#13;
response to an increase in the output of a given industry. The total labor&#13;
and capital coefficients are obtained by multiplying the inverse coefficients&#13;
by the direct labor and capital coefficients, industry by industry, and then&#13;
summing over all industries. The differences between the total and direct&#13;
labor and capital requirements are the indirect effects, which arise from&#13;
interindustry linkages. Naturally, as interindustry linkages increase, the&#13;
indirect effect of a given increase in output increases commensurately.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
We define Lj as the total (direct-plus-indirect) labor coefficient,&#13;
which indicates the additional labor required in all sectors by a unit&#13;
increase in the final demand for the output of sector j:&#13;
m&#13;
(1)      =          r&#13;
where   9i is the direct labor coefficient of sector i and r     is an element&#13;
i                                                    ij&#13;
of the Leontief inverse matrix, which measures the direct-plus-indirect inputs&#13;
required per unit. of production in sector j. 1/ We define Kj as the total&#13;
(direct-plus-indirect) capital coefficient, which indicates the additional&#13;
capital required in all sectors by a unit increase in the final demand for the&#13;
output of sector j:&#13;
m&#13;
(2)  K;  =     E kirii,&#13;
where ki is the direct capital coefficient of sector i and rij is an element&#13;
of the Leontief inverse matrix.&#13;
The use of total labor and capital coefficients makes it possible&#13;
to explore the economywide impact of an increase in final demand (in par-&#13;
ticular, investment) of a given industry on employment and capital require-&#13;
ments. By using the direct labor coefficient, it is possible only to&#13;
estimate the effect of an expansion in output of a particular industry on the&#13;
employment of that same industry. But by using the total labor coefficient,&#13;
it is possible to estimate the change in employment of the entire economy&#13;

(I - A ) , where I i.s an identity matrix.&#13;

arising from, say, a given investment in a particular industry. By compar-&#13;
ing the total labor coefficients among various industries, it is possible&#13;
to determine the sectors in which a given amount of investment would generate&#13;
the most employment in the economy. Similarly, by comparing the total&#13;
capital coefficients among industries, it is possible to find out the&#13;
sectors in which a given expansion of output would result in a greater&#13;
increase in the capital requirements of the economy.&#13;
Two points are worth noting about the concepts just discussed.&#13;
First, the total labor and capital coefficients capture the effect of&#13;
total (direct-plus-indirect) interindustry linkages on labor and capital&#13;
requirements, but that effect reflects only the backward linkages induced&#13;
by the needs of each industry for intermediate inputs. There is no con-&#13;
sideration of the forward linkages: that is, of the effect of a sector's&#13;
increased domestic supply capability on the growth prospects of sectors that&#13;
use its product as intermediate inputs. Put differently: forward linkages&#13;
are related to the expansion of supply and the effect on product-using&#13;
sectors; backward linkages are related to the expansion of final demand and&#13;
the induced changes in the requirements of all sectors for intermediate&#13;
inputs. For such backward linkages, moreover, the increased demand for&#13;
intermediate inputs is assumed to be automatically met through the propor-&#13;
tional expansion of domestic production and imported supply. Thus the&#13;
backward linkages considered here ignore supply constraints originating in&#13;
limitations of capacity or the scarcity of foreign exchange.&#13;
Second, the input-output coefficients used in deriving the total&#13;
labor and capital coefficients should include only the domestically supplied&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
component of intermediate inputs. An expansion of a sector calls for&#13;
additional intermediate inputs, but a part of them must often be supplied&#13;
by imports because of the economy's inability to produce all the required&#13;
inputs. The part supplied by imports--that is, the leakages to imports--&#13;
generates no further production by domestic industries and no further effects&#13;
on the labor and capital requirements of the economy. Thus the imported com-&#13;
ponent of input-output coefficients is irrelevant for an analysis of total&#13;
labor and capital requirements and should be excluded from consideration.&#13;
II. SOURCES AND APPLICATIONS OF DATA&#13;
Leontief and others (1977) recently developed, under auspices of the United&#13;
Nations, a set of interindustry tables specific to different levels of per&#13;
capita income--tables complete with labor, capital, and value-added coeffi-&#13;
cients for each income level. In addition, other available studies--Chenery&#13;
and Taylor (1968), for example--provide a series of regression equations that&#13;
can be used to estimate the level and composition of both production and&#13;
demand for specific levels of per capita income. The availability of such&#13;
data inspired the analysis of employment patterns in this study.&#13;
Interindustry Matrices&#13;
The interindustry matrices of the U.N. world model--for thirty&#13;
sectors, fifteen regions, and eight average levels of per capita income--are&#13;
based on an analysis of a, number of individual country tables. 1/ Normally it&#13;
1/   The eight ranges of per capita income have means of $200, $500, $750,&#13;
$1,550, $1,850, $2,550, $2,800, and $4,600 in 1970 prices. The fifteen&#13;
regions are distinguished by region-specific coefficients which relate&#13;
primarily to trade, such as import coefficients. The combination of&#13;
region-specific coefficients with eight income-specific input-output&#13;
tables generates data that cover fifteen regions and eight ranges of&#13;
per capita incomes.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
would take years of analysis and data refinement before country tables--&#13;
compiled by different statistical agencies on the basis of domestic prices&#13;
that are distorted to varying degree--could be placed on a comparable basis&#13;
in a consistent manner to represent the interindustry structures for various&#13;
income levels. Because this analysis and refinement proved to be impossi-&#13;
ble, Leontief and others (1977) estimated many coefficients on the basis of&#13;
regressions of available coefficients on per capita income. They then used&#13;
these regression equations to generate input-output, labor, and capital&#13;
coefficients for selected levels of per capita income. An inevitable con-&#13;
sequence of this procedure is that changes in coefficients appear to be&#13;
smooth as per capita income., rises, whereas there may in fact be sharp discon-&#13;
tinuities.  Moreover, the estimates are only crude approximations of the&#13;
general trend and should not be considered applicable to any specific country&#13;
at a specific stage of development.&#13;
The input-output coefficients estimated in the world model reflect&#13;
the requirements of imported and domestically produced intermediate inputs.&#13;
As mentioned earlier, however, the use of domestic input-output coefficients,&#13;
which exclude imported componenets, is more appropriate in an analysis of&#13;
employment creation through interindustry linkages. To obtain these domestic&#13;
input-output coefficients required an adjustment of the (domestic plus&#13;
imported) input-output coefficients of the world model.&#13;
The world model provides import coefficients--that is, ratios of&#13;
imports to total domestic supply-for each industry, separately for the&#13;
fifteen regions and for the eight levels of per capita income. These import&#13;
coefficients showed little relation to the level of income but clearly dif-&#13;
fered by regional resource and factor endowments. Thus the fifteen sets of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
region-specific import coefficients were averaged irrespective of per capita&#13;
income to yield a set of average import coefficients by industry. This&#13;
set was then used to adjust all eight income-specific interindustry tables.&#13;
This procedure of course neglects the effect of changing trade patterns on&#13;
growth and sectoral produLction. Changes in domestic coefficients reflect&#13;
the changing product mix and technology, but they do not reflect import&#13;
substitution--as captured. by a decline in the ratio of imported to total&#13;
supply--because that ratio is assumed to be the same at each income level.&#13;
The tables thus understate the extent to which interindustry linkages increase&#13;
with economic development, but it is not known by how much. This point is&#13;
significant in the interpretation of findings and will be brought up again in&#13;
the fourth section.&#13;
The matrices of domestic input-output coefficients thus obtained&#13;
were used to estimate the total labor and capital coefficients. The results&#13;
are shown in appendix tables B.1-B.4 for each level of per capita income,&#13;
as are the direct labor and capital coefficients.&#13;
Estimates of Sectoral Production&#13;
The average variation in industrial structure associated with&#13;
differences in size, reso;urce endowment, and per capita income was examined&#13;
by Chenery and Taylor (19,58) on the basis of a statistical analysis of a large&#13;
number of countries. The regression equations they developed describe average&#13;
growth patterns of three aggregate sectors and twelve manufacturing subsectors&#13;
for "large" and "small" countries. Because of the large size of their sample,&#13;
we applied these regression equations to obtain estimates of sectoral pro-&#13;
duction for an average country at different levels of per capita income.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
Chenery and Taylor used a population figure of 15 million as the dividing&#13;
point between "large" and "small" countries. We used their large-country&#13;
regression equations and set the population of our "average" country at 20&#13;
million to avoid selecting a country size at the break-point of their sample.&#13;
The Chenery-Taylor equations were used to derive the shares in gross&#13;
national product of primary production (agriculture and mining), industry&#13;
(manufacturing and construction), and services (all other sectors). 1/ Data&#13;
on the shares of gross fixed-capital formation and trade, which are called&#13;
for by those equations, were estimated from data and regression equations&#13;
in Chenery and Syrquin (1975). Because the sample of countries used in&#13;
the Chenery-Taylor study does not adequately cover countries at the top end&#13;
of the range of per capita income, estimates generally were not made beyond&#13;
$2,550 per capita.&#13;
Separate regression equations, again specific to a typical "large"&#13;
country, were then used to estimate the shares in total value added of&#13;
twelve principal industrial sectors (Chenery and Taylor 1968, p. 406). When&#13;
a further disaggregation was required to match the value-added estimates to&#13;
the definitions of sectors in the interindustry tables, the 1970 levels of&#13;
output shown in the study by Leontief and others (1977) were used. The&#13;
estimates of value added for each level of per capita income were converted&#13;
to gross value of production by applying the value-added coefficients from&#13;
the appropriate income-specific interindustry table derived by Leontief and&#13;
others (1977). The estimates of the gross value of production were then&#13;
1/ Gross national product was determined by multiplying 20 million by each&#13;
level of per capita income.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
used with the income-specific labor and capital coefficients to derive the&#13;
patterns of employment and capital use consistent with successive levels of&#13;
per capita income in an average "large" economy.&#13;
Applications of Data&#13;
In section three the labor and capital coefficients from the world&#13;
model are used in conjunction with the estimates of sectoral production. In&#13;
the first part of that section, the total labor and capital coefficients&#13;
are used to show relative changes in the economywide factor intensity associ-&#13;
ated with output expansion by a given sector. The estimates of the gross&#13;
value of sectoral production are then used with the income-specific labor&#13;
and capital coefficients to derive the patterns of employment and investment&#13;
consistent with increases in per capita income in a typical economy. In&#13;
section four both the direct and total labor coefficients are used in an&#13;
analysis of the sources of change in total labor coefficients as an economy&#13;
moves to successively higher levels of per capita income. Although all&#13;
computations were carriecd out for the thirty sectors of the world model, the&#13;
results were aggregated 1:o either twelve or twenty sectors for most purposes&#13;
of presentation and discussion. 1/&#13;
Before turning to the results the following should be noted.&#13;
Because country size and foreign trade create important differences in&#13;
the industrialization pai:h of large and small countries, the results pre-&#13;
sented here are not directly applicable to all countries at a particular&#13;
1/   For a description of the thirty sectors, see Leontief and others (1977)&#13;
and Stern (1977). The weights used to aggregate coefficients are the&#13;
gross values of production estimated from the cross-country regression&#13;
equations of Chenery and Taylor (1968), plus the 1970 levels of output&#13;
for subsectors from Leontief and others (1977).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
level of per capita income. For example, although the share of the pri-&#13;
mary sector (agriculture and mining) in GNP declines for all countries&#13;
as development proceeds, Chenery and Taylor (1968, p. 395) note that for&#13;
large countries the "industrial share rises at a rapid rate during the early&#13;
phases of growth, but then reaches a peak at a per capita income of $1,200."&#13;
By contrast, their small-country regression equations show a lower income&#13;
elasticity for industrial activites in the early phases of development but&#13;
no tendency for the share of industry to decline at higher income levels.&#13;
Such differences are, of course, reflected in employment patterns, which&#13;
naturally differ for countries of different size. Moreover, because popula-&#13;
tion is held constant in our analysis, we are in effect looking at snapshots&#13;
of an economy that has 20 million persons at each income level. As a result,&#13;
the size of the industrial sector is underestimated at lower levels of per&#13;
capita income, and the decline in the share of the industrial sector is more&#13;
pronounced at higher levels of per capita income, given the omission of the&#13;
effect of increasing population on demand.&#13;
III. IMPACT OF CHANGES IN PRODUCTION ON EMPLOYMENT AND CAPITAL&#13;
The income-specific interindustry matrices make it possible to analyze changes&#13;
in capital-labor ratios, which in this section are defined as the ratios of&#13;
total capital coefficients to total labor coefficients. The ratios thus&#13;
pertain to the total (direct-plus-indirect) requirements of capital and labor&#13;
per unit of final demand for a given sector's output. In addition, the&#13;
interindustry matrices, the labor and capital coefficients, and the estimates&#13;
of the gross value of sectoral production yield data on the average levels of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
employment and capital st:ock associated with rising levels of per capita&#13;
income. These data allow an analysis of changing structures of employment,&#13;
capital stock, and invest:ment flows.&#13;
Changes in Capital-Labor Ratios&#13;
Because capital. is considered to be the scarce resource in a typical&#13;
developing economy, while labor is relatively abundant, there is a strong&#13;
tendency to assume that employment maximization can be achieved by using a&#13;
single criterion: choosing activities that have the lowest capital-labor&#13;
ratio. This obviously is an oversimplification, because capital intensity&#13;
is only one of many factors that policymakers would want to keep in mind. 1/&#13;
But it is important to note that consideration of the capital-labor ratio&#13;
does bring to the fore the implications of any investment choice for the&#13;
requirements of capital and labor.&#13;
In table 1 we tiring together the direct-plus-indirect requirements&#13;
of fixed capital per unit of direct-plus-indirect employment created. The&#13;
data show that the capital-labor ratios associated with an expansion of each&#13;
industry rise with development and that the rankings among them change. As&#13;
would be expected, expansion of the construction sector is relatively labor-&#13;
intensive at all income levels; expansion of the chemicals sector is rather&#13;
capital-intensive. It is important to note that the capital-labor ratios&#13;
of sectors do not apply to all activities in those sectors. For example,&#13;
within the chemicals sector, the capital-labor ratio is by far the highest for&#13;
output expansion by petroleum refining, followed by industrial chemicals,&#13;

fertilizers, and other chemicals. 1/ If petroleum refining is excluded,&#13;
output expansion by the chemicals sector generates a capital-labor ratio&#13;
close to that associated with output expansion by the nonmetallic minerals&#13;
sector. The rather high and rising ratio for output expansion by the food-&#13;
processing sector reflects that this sector is defined to include processing&#13;
margins only, while food agriculture is regarded as the direct deliveries&#13;
from agriculture to final demand. 2/ The share of total expenditure devoted&#13;
to food declines as per capita incomes rise, but the processing of food&#13;
increases and the relatively high capital intensity of such processing activi-&#13;
ties is reflected in the capital-labor ratios. An expansion of output by the&#13;
nonmetallic-minerals sector becomes more capital-intensive as development&#13;
proceeds. The capital-labor ratio associated with the expansion of the&#13;
metal-products sector also increases at successive levels of per capita&#13;
income, even though the production of transport equipment included in this&#13;
sector is relatively labor-intensive.&#13;
The rise in capital-labor ratios associated with output expansion&#13;
by aggregations of sectors, shown in the top part of table 2, reflects the&#13;
1/   The findings for subsectors are based on computations using data in&#13;
appendix tables B.2 and B.4.&#13;
2/   Because of this definition, capital-output and labor-output ratios&#13;
of this sector tend to be significantly overestimated (since gross&#13;
output is underestimated by the value of intermediate inputs from agri-&#13;
culture). In turn, the link between food processing and agriculture&#13;
through intermediate inputs is ignored, so that total labor and capital&#13;
requirements corresponding to an expansion of the food processing sector&#13;
are underestimated. Because food processing activities are relatively&#13;
capital-intensive while agriculture is generally labor-intensive, the&#13;
effect of defining the output of food processing sector net of inter-&#13;
mediate inputs from agriculture Ls to overestimate substantially the&#13;
total capital-labor ratio for this sector. Thus the results for the&#13;
food-processing sector should be interpreted with caution.&#13;

increases in capital-labcr ratios attributable to output expansion by&#13;
individual sectors and the shifts in the composition of production as per&#13;
capita income increases from $200 to $2,550. The capital-labor ratios&#13;
attributable to output expansion by individual sectors rise continuously&#13;
for all industrial sectors except miscellaneous manufacturing; they con-&#13;
tribute to the increases in the capital-labor ratios associated with output&#13;
expansion by aggregations of sectors. But changes in the composition of&#13;
production have a more varied on the aggregate ratios at different levels&#13;
of per capita income, as can be seen by comparing the figures in the top&#13;
part of table 2 with those in the bottom part, where the composition of&#13;
production at $200 per capita is used for all income levels in calculating&#13;
the aggregate capital-labor ratios. The result of eliminating the effect&#13;
of changes in the composition of production in this way is a lower capital-&#13;
labor ratio for the manufacturing sectors until an income of $750 is reached.&#13;
Beyond $750, however, the effect reverses; at $2,550 per capita, the capital-&#13;
labor ratios, for the constant compositLon of production exceed those for the&#13;
changing composition by about 8 percent. Thus, although changes in the&#13;
structure of industrial output clearly affect the capital-labor ratio for the&#13;
aggregations of sectors, the effect dose not appear to be pronounced or to&#13;
operate monotonically.&#13;

position of employment and capital in manufacturing is shown in figure 1,&#13;
as is the composition of output.&#13;
In general, employment shifts to the more technologically advanced&#13;
activities at successive levels of per capita income, given their rising&#13;
shares in industrial output. The primary metals, metal products, and machin-&#13;
ery sectors, which together account for only about 15 percent of industrial&#13;
employment at the lowest levels of per capita income, account for more than a&#13;
third of manufacturing employment at the highest level of per capita income&#13;
examined ($2,550). By contrast, the employment shares of paper and printing&#13;
show relatively little change; such consumer-goods industries as food process-&#13;
ing and textiles lose their predominant share in manufacturing employment.&#13;
The shares of chemicals, machinery, and metal products in the total&#13;
stock of manufacturing capital all increase as income rises. By contrast,&#13;
the shares of the traditional sectors--including textiles, food processing,&#13;
and rubber products-decline. Changes in the composition of the capital stock&#13;
by subsectors are worth noting. 1/ In the chemicals sector, the largest&#13;
increments in capital occur first in fertilizer and subsequently, when an&#13;
income of $1,550 per capita is reached, in industrial chemicals and petroleum&#13;
refining. In the metal-products sector, transport equipment remains rela-&#13;
tively insignificant in relation to its share in total capital stock at income&#13;
levels below $1,550 per capita; beyond that level an increasing proportion of&#13;
the economy's capital stock is devoted to creating capacity in this subsector.&#13;
1/ The findings for subsectors are based on computations using data in&#13;
appendix table B.3 and the sectoral production levels derived by apply-&#13;
ing the Chenery-Syrquin (1975) regression equations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
The increase in the capital stock of the machinery sector is the result of&#13;
an increase first in the capital stock of nonelectrical machinery and at&#13;
later stages of income growth in the capital stock of electrical machinery.&#13;
In the nonmetallic-minerals sector, the cement industry expands its capital&#13;
stock first and the other industries in that sector expand their capacity&#13;
subsequently.&#13;
Increases in Capacity and Flows of Investment&#13;
Given the capital stock associated with each sector at each level&#13;
of per capita income, we can derive the investment flows consistent with the&#13;
terminal per capita income of each income interval. To derive the investment&#13;
required in each sector, we must use a stock-flow conversion formula, which&#13;
expresses the investment in the terminal year--that is, the year in which&#13;
the target rate of income is reached--as a function of the sectoral growth&#13;
rate and the increment in, capacity created. 1/ That enables us to look at&#13;
changes in the structure of investment at different levels of per capita&#13;
income.&#13;
Suppose that each sector grows at a constant rate, gi.   If there&#13;
is no lag between investment and new output, the following relation must&#13;
hold:&#13;
t                                  t+1&#13;
3) 1i(t)/ E    I1 ( T) - g (U + gi ) /M[( + 8l     - 11 - f(gi ; t).&#13;
.r-0&#13;
where Ii is the net investment in sector i, gi is the rate of growth in&#13;
sector i, and t is the number of years, or planning horizon, needed to reach&#13;
1/   See Taylor in Blitzer and others (1975) and Porter (1970).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
the terminal income level. This relation shows that, under the foregoing&#13;
assumptions, the investment profile of a sector over time is determined by&#13;
the sectoral growth rate (gi) and the time horizon (t).   The sum of the&#13;
investment between year 0 and year t should just equal the increment in&#13;
capacity, which is assumed to be proportional to increments in sectoral&#13;
output:&#13;
t&#13;
(4)        i ( I   ) T  hi[Xi(t) - Xi(O)],&#13;
T0O&#13;
where h is the incremental capital-output ratio and X. is the gross&#13;
value of production in sector i. Thus:&#13;
(5) Ii(t) = f(g ; t) hi[Xi(t) - Xi(0)].&#13;
The sectoral investment level for the terminal year of each income interval&#13;
can be estimated from equation 5. Note that because of the differences in&#13;
sectoral growth rates, the sectoral composition of investment in the terminal&#13;
year will be different from the composition of the change in capital stock&#13;
between the initial and terminal year. They are equal only when all sectors&#13;
grow at the same rate.&#13;
The sectoral growth rates can be determined from the number of&#13;
years, t, required for an economy to move from one level of per capital income&#13;
to another, because the sectoral production levels at each income level&#13;
are already known. But to determine the time horizon, t, the rate of growth&#13;
of per capita income must be set exogenously. We have arbitrarily chosen a&#13;
growth rate of 3.75 percent a year in per capita income. 1/ Many developing&#13;
1/   This growth rate implies that an economy will require twenty-five years&#13;
to move from an income of $200 per capita to $500 per capita.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
countries have achieved such a rate of growth in per capita GNP, but it&#13;
clearly is near the upper range of the growth experience of most developing&#13;
countries. 1/ Given thatt many developing countries have population growth&#13;
rates of more than 2.25 percent a year, the assumed growth rate of per capita&#13;
income translates into a! rate of growth of about 6 percent a year in total&#13;
national product. Having settled on a 3.75 percent annual rate of growth for&#13;
income per capita, we can define the time horizon, t, required to move an&#13;
economy from one level of per capita income to the next. Given this specific&#13;
time period, we can then. calculate the growth rates, gi, for sectoral value&#13;
added. 2/ These growth rates naturally will differ. 3/ Once the variables&#13;
t and gi have been determined, we can use them to convert the estimated&#13;
changes in capital stock into an investment flow. The sectoral composition of&#13;
investment is shown in table 3.&#13;
The shares in industrial investment of food processing, textiles,&#13;
and rubber products decline; the shares of machinery, metal products, and&#13;
chemicals rise. On balance the ranking of sectors by their shares in invest-&#13;
ment does not show any dramatic variation, though the investment in various&#13;
sectors shows considerable variation. Note also that the share of industrial&#13;
1/   See the growth rates shown in the World Bank Atlas, World Bank, 1976.&#13;
2/   Strictly, growth rates of output should have been used, but for practical&#13;
convenience, growth rates of value added were used, thereby implicitly&#13;
assuming that value-added coefficients do not change much as an economy&#13;
moves to successive income levels.&#13;
3/   Using a higher or lower growth rate for total income would of course&#13;
change the growth rates for sectoral value added. This would in turn&#13;
change sectoral investment levels. But the stock-flow conversion for-&#13;
mula is relatively insensitive to alternative assumptions of the rate&#13;
of growth. Using a growth rate of 2.65 percent a year for per capita&#13;
income did not significantly change the investment level for most sec-&#13;
tors.&#13;

IV. CHANGES IN LABOR COEFFICIENTS AND INTERINDUSTRY RELATIONS&#13;
The direct labor coefficients of the U.N. world model reveal that for nearly&#13;
all sectors the estimated direct labor coefficients--or conventional labor-&#13;
output ratios--decline as income levels rise (see appendix table B.1).&#13;
Because the rate of decline of the direct labor coefficients differs among&#13;
sectors, the relative labor intensity of various sectors changes as develop-&#13;
ment proceeds; this effect underlies the results shown in table 1 in the&#13;
preceeding section. For example, of the manufacturing sectors, the furniture-&#13;
and-fixtures sector has the highest direct labor coefficient at an income of&#13;
$200 per capita, but it ranks only in the middle third at an income of $2,800&#13;
per capita. By contrast, of all thirty sectors, the paper sector ranks&#13;
twenty-first at an income of $200 per capita, but it ranks fifth at an income&#13;
of $2,800 per capita, evea though the absolute level of its direct labor&#13;
coefficient declines as income rises.&#13;
Two related phenomena underlie these observed changes in the direct&#13;
labor coefficients. First, capital is substituted for labor as labor costs&#13;
rise relative to capital costs, resulting in a decline of the direct labor&#13;
coefficient. Second, the product mix in each sector changes as development&#13;
proceeds: products that are relatively more intensive in capital replace&#13;
labor-intensive products, a phenomenon that is in part induced by shifts in&#13;
the wage-rental ratio.&#13;
It was pointed out earlier that although the direct labor coeffi-&#13;
cients decline as per capita income rises, a sector's employment may increase&#13;
in response to increases Ln the total demand for its output. In addition, the&#13;
expansion of that sector's output may lead to additional increases in total&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
employment in the economy because of the    increased production required in&#13;
other sectors supplying intermediate inputs. Thus the direct plus indirect&#13;
effects of output expansion on economywide employment can be substantial&#13;
even if the initial impetus for expansion is in a relatively capital-intensive&#13;
sector (compare the total labor coefficients in appendix table B.2 with the&#13;
direct labor coefficients in appendix table B.1). 1/&#13;
As sectors become more specialized, there is a tendency for the&#13;
linkages between sectors to become more pronounced. In addition, inputs&#13;
previously imported become domestically produced as industries using more&#13;
advanced technologies and supplying domestic intermediate inputs are estab-&#13;
lished, and that further increases the interindustry linkages. Thus, although&#13;
the reduction in direct labor coefficients works to reduce the employment&#13;
effect of output expansion, the increasing interindustry linkages that charac-&#13;
terize a more developed economy serve to increase that effect. Our earlier&#13;
caveat should be restated here. Because of the way we derived the domestic&#13;
input-output tables, the increased employment attributable to increasing&#13;
interindustry linkages reflects changes in input-output coefficients originat-&#13;
ing only in changes in product mix and technology. It does not reflect&#13;
changes in the structure of production that originate in import substitution.&#13;
What, then, are the effects on total employment of changes in the&#13;
labor coefficients and in interindustry relations?&#13;
1/   A fuller description of direct and total labor (and capital) coeffi-&#13;
cients is in Krishnamurty (1975).&#13;

Sources of Change in Tolial Labor Coefficients&#13;
We have defined L   as the total (direct-plus-indirect) labor&#13;
coefficient:&#13;
m&#13;
(6)  L   -       Â£irijV&#13;
i-l&#13;
where Q   is the direct labor coefficient of sector i and r      is an element&#13;
of the domestic inverse matrix. If we denote by presubscripts an initial and&#13;
a subsequent level of irncome, the change in total labor coefficients between&#13;
two income levels is:&#13;
(7)     AL    -   2L       L.j&#13;
( )     j      2 j      ILJ&#13;
Given a set of distinct interindustry matrices for different income levels,&#13;
together with sets of-direct labor coefficients, we can express equation&#13;
7 as:&#13;
m                  m&#13;

Equation 8a can be rewritten to yield:,&#13;
m&#13;

The expression in the first set of brackets measures the change in the total&#13;
(direct-plus-indirect) labor coefficient (L) resulting from changes in the&#13;
direct labor coefficients (Q1), holding the interindustry structure constant.&#13;
This expression has two parts:    (2Qj 2  l%)1rjj captures the effect of change&#13;
m&#13;
in the direct labor coefficient of sector j;    E (2Qi- 1ki)1ri. captures the&#13;
effect of changes in the direct labor coefficients of all other sectors.&#13;
The expression in the second set of brackets measures the change in the total&#13;
labor coefficient (L ) brought about by changes in the interindustry rela-&#13;
tions of the economy (rij), holding the direct labor coefficients ( ki)&#13;
constant. The expression in the third set of brackets shows the result of&#13;
interaction between changes in direct labor coefficients and changes in inter-&#13;
industry relations.&#13;
Data on the various sources of change in the total labor coeffi-&#13;
cients (L ) are shown in table 5. For each sector the reduction of&#13;
the total labor coefficient, in moving from an income per capita of $200 to&#13;
that of $4,600, is taken as 100 percent. Also for each sector, the contri-&#13;
butions of the various sources-the effect of change in the direct labor&#13;
coefficient of sector J, the effect of changes in the direct labor coeffi-&#13;
cients of other sectors, the effect of changes in interindustry relations,&#13;
and the interaction effect of these three factors--are shown as percentages&#13;
of the reduction in the total labor coefficient. Because the total labor&#13;
coefficients are declining, a negative contribution by any source indicates&#13;
that the source of the change in L contributed to increasing the employment&#13;
impact of increases in demand for the sector's output and offset the other&#13;
sources of change to some extent. The analysis was carried out by using the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
full thirty-sector tables available, but because a number of these sectors&#13;
were small, the results hiave been aggregated to twenty sectors. Because&#13;
this aggregation submerged some interesting results, we also show the analysis&#13;
for six subsectors (table 6). That table also gives a breakdown of changes&#13;
between the six income levels identified. 1/&#13;
For all the sectors shown in table 5, the effect of the decline in&#13;
direct labor coefficients (shown in the first two columns) outweighs, and&#13;
indeed overwhelms, the effect of the increasing interindustry linkages. 2/&#13;
For almost all sectors, between half and three-quarters of the change in&#13;
total labor coefficients takes place between $200 per capita and $1,550 per&#13;
capita (see appendix table B.6), a pattern that applies equally to the sub-&#13;
sectors; shown in table 6.&#13;
Changes in Direct Labor Coefficients. We first turn to the contribu-&#13;
tion of changes in the direct labor coefficients (Q i) to changes in the total&#13;
(direct-plus-indirect) labor coefficient (Li). This contribution has two&#13;
parts. The first, shown in the first column of tables 5 and 6, measures the&#13;
contribution of a change in the labor coefficient of sector j ( IQ). The&#13;
1/   The agricultural sector has been omitted because labor coefficients&#13;
were not available for this sector for income below $1,550 per capita,&#13;
given the presumed difficulty in defining a fixed labor-output ratio&#13;
for agriculture in a surplus-labor situation. In addition, two income&#13;
levels have been omitted so as to focus on larger changes between&#13;
income levels.&#13;
The absolute changes in the total labor coefficients and the con-&#13;
tribution of changes in the direct labor coefficient, the interindustry&#13;
structure, and their interactions, are shown in appendix table B.5; the&#13;
percentage changes, in appendix table B.6.   The total labor coefficients&#13;
anid direct labor coefficients are shown in appendix tables B.1 and B.2.&#13;

which has been aggregated with the metal-products sector.&#13;

second part, shown in the second column of those tables, measures the con-&#13;
tribution of changes in the labor coefficients of all other sectors. 1/ A&#13;
comparison of the two parts reveals the importance of the change in labor&#13;
coefficients of other sectors in the decline of the total (direct-plus-&#13;
indirect) labor coefficient of any one industrial sector. Put differently:&#13;
for each of the industrial sectors, the dominant factor contributing to&#13;
changes in total labor coefficients is the effect of changes in the direct&#13;
labor coefficients of other sectors. Moreover, the contribution of that&#13;
effect is highest at the lower level of per capita income; it becomes less&#13;
important as per capita income rises. In addition, that effect invariably&#13;
contributes to the decline in the total labor coefficient, greatly over-&#13;
shadowing the effect of change in a sector's own labor coefficient, even when&#13;
the effect of that change would otherwise have increased its total labor&#13;
coefficient--as for paper, metal products, and miscellaneous manufacturing.&#13;
By contrast, the effect on the total labor coefficients of changes&#13;
in a sector's own direct labor coefficient is predominant for the nonindus-&#13;
trial sectors-construction, trade, transport, communications, and services,&#13;
n.e.s.-whereas the effect of changes in the direct labor coefficients of&#13;
other sectors is relatively moderate. This contrast between the industrial&#13;
and nonindustrial sectors reflects the greater contribution of intermediate&#13;
input-supplying sectors to the expansion of industrial output than to the&#13;
expansion of services.&#13;
1/   It should once again be made clear that the total labor coefficient&#13;
(L ) estimates the effect of output expansion by sector j on employment&#13;
throughout the economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- :37 -&#13;
Changes in Interindustry Relations. We now turn to the effect&#13;
that changes in interindustry relations have on employment. The increased&#13;
interindustry linkages that accompany development serve to increase the&#13;
impact on employment of output expansion in most sectors, as is shown in the&#13;
third column of tables 5 and 6. Although interindustry linkages generally&#13;
are stronger at higher income levels, thereby serving to increase the total&#13;
employment generated as a consequence of output expansion, this effect on the&#13;
whole is relatively wea:k. Part of the reason is that the data base neglects&#13;
the potential effect of import substitution on domestic intermediate demand.&#13;
Allowance for import substitution would generally increase the relative&#13;
importance of this effect on the change in total employment.&#13;
The interindustry effect is stronger for output expansion in such&#13;
technologically advanced sectors as chemical products, motor vehicles, and&#13;
electrical and nonelectrical machinery-but it still is very small. Among the&#13;
strongest interindustry effects are those arising from output expansion in the&#13;
construction sector and the motor vehicle sector, both of which tend to have&#13;
stronger linkages with other sectors at higher income levels. For a few&#13;
sectors, including food processing, the effect of changes in interindustry&#13;
relations across the ent:ire income range fails to offset, and in fact rein-&#13;
forces, the effect of declining direct labor coefficients.&#13;
The changing extent of interindustry linkages is reflected by the&#13;
extent of intermediate inputs used by various industries per unit of output.&#13;
Experiences of a number of countries show that for nearly all industries the&#13;
ratio of domestic intermediate inputs to output rises as income rises. 1/&#13;
1/   Such trends have been observed in, for example, the input-output tables&#13;
compiled for nine countries in the "Sources of Industrial Growth and&#13;
Structural Change" research project of the World Bank.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
These increasing linkages between sectors increase the indirect demand for&#13;
labor. *This increase in indirect demand, which occurs when output expands,&#13;
is important in determining the relative impact various sectors will have on&#13;
employment creation. 1/&#13;
V. CONCLUSION&#13;
The foregoing analysis has tried to identify some patterns of industrial&#13;
employment and investment using a data base that specified the interindustry&#13;
structure for economies at different levels of per capita income. It is&#13;
well known that the share of employment in the primary sector falls as an&#13;
economy develops, while that in the industrial sector rises. In the indus-&#13;
trial sector, however, the pattern of employment does not necessarily follow&#13;
the pattern of structural change in output, primarily because investment and&#13;
technological advances are concentrated in the so-called modern branches of&#13;
manufacturing, such as chemicals, basic metals, metal products, and machinery&#13;
(see figure 1 on pages 18 and 19).&#13;
The changing level and composition of production naturally have&#13;
important influences on the employment pattern. When production is explicitly&#13;
considered, it is possible to depict in a model the structure of industrial&#13;
employment at different income levels. As would be expected, the share of&#13;
employment in the traditional consumer-oriented sectors declines as per capita&#13;
income rises. The impact of capital-labor substitution begins to reduce the&#13;
1/   Following Moore (1955), the effect of coefficient changes on production&#13;
levels and hence on employment and investment could be directly meas-&#13;
ured. Such a measurement, which Moore calls coefficient-by-coefficient&#13;
parametric variation, was not carried out here.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
shares in employment of some of the technologically advanced sectors after&#13;
an income of $1,550 per capita has been reached. But the shares in indus-&#13;
trial employment of some modern sectors, such as machinery and metal products,&#13;
increase from about 15 percent at $200 per capita to more than a third at&#13;
$2,550 per capita, the highest income level considered.&#13;
In all industrial sectors the direct labor coefficients, or labor-&#13;
output ratios, decline as an economy dievelops. This decline, associated with&#13;
technological progress and the substitution between capital and labor, will&#13;
tend to reduce the employment impact of an expansion in output.   At the same&#13;
time, however, the increasing interindustry linkages that accompany economic&#13;
growth serve to increase the employment impact of output expansion. This&#13;
interindustry effect is relatively small, however, at least as measured by&#13;
using input-output matrices that do not capture the changes caused by import&#13;
substitution. The interindustry effect is strongest in the construction sector&#13;
and in the chemicals, motor vehicles, and machinery sectors. 1/ In general,&#13;
it was observed that the employment imapact of increased interindustry link-&#13;
ages was strongest for industries which had the sharpest declines in the&#13;
direct labor coefficients and hence the most rapid increases in labor produc-&#13;
tivity. Thus, for the technologically most advanced sectors, the increased&#13;
indirect effect of their output expansion on economywide employment tended on&#13;
the whole to mitigate the adverse direct effect on employment, as reflected in&#13;
their direct labor coefficients.&#13;
1/   We note again that the changes in interindustry coefficients reflect&#13;
changes in technology and product mix but neglect import substitution.&#13;
The explanation resides the manner in which the matrices of domestic&#13;
coefficients were derived (see pp. 8-9).&#13;

fies the general patterns of employment which others have commented on (Kuznets&#13;
1966; Maddison 1970). 1/ Nevertheless the available data base and method&#13;
probably are not robust enough to allow further inferences to be drawn. The&#13;
patterns elicited here need not be inevitable or applicable to all countries&#13;
regardless of size, resource endowment, or external policies. The analysis&#13;
of significant differences in development patterns, rather than an analysis&#13;
of assumed uniformity, will eventually yield more powerful insights.&#13;
Some general conclusions can nevertheless be drawn from this&#13;
analysis of average patterns of employment associated with rising levels of&#13;
per capita income. Such often-used measures of employment creation as the&#13;
labor-output ratio or the capital-labor ratio provide meaningful indices of&#13;
technological characteristics only under highly restrictive assumptions. In&#13;
reality these measures are often misleading guides of the true employment&#13;
potential of various sectors. Most obviously, they neglect the indirect&#13;
employment that arises in sectors supplying inputs to the sector where the&#13;
original expansion occurs. Perhaps equally important, the relative attrac-&#13;
tiveness of specific sectors in their employment-creating potential changes&#13;
as per capita incomes rise. Thus discussions of the labor intensity of&#13;
various activities must take account not only of the indirect production&#13;
effects on employment but also of the relative state of development as mea-&#13;
sured by per capita income levels. Both these factors affect the simple&#13;
1/   To paraphrase Kuznets (1966):   the share of the labor force employed&#13;
in industry rises in every country studied although the extent of the&#13;
absolute and relative increase varies, depending on changes in demand&#13;
and supply patterns, and on the effect of innovation and technological&#13;
change on productivity.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
indices of employment creation often used to buttress arguments about the&#13;
best strategy for employment creation. While the analysis carried out is too&#13;
crude to provide sector- or country-specific guidance on employment creation,&#13;
it does demonstrate the matrix of factors that serve to determine the level&#13;
and composition of employment.&#13;
The available data are too weak and are inappropriately constructed&#13;
to test a number of hypotheses concerning employment creation. First,&#13;
because of the treatment of trade, we have not been able to analyze the&#13;
impact of strategies for import substitution or export promotion on employ-&#13;
ment. Country case studies indicate that policies for foreign trade are&#13;
important in increasing an economy's Labor-absorptive capacity, but cross-&#13;
section studies to test this hypothesis are still lacking. Second, the&#13;
analysis neglects the dynamic aspects of development. Consideration of&#13;
such variables as savings rates by factor income recipients and the poten-&#13;
tial relation between the rate of innovation and the degree of capital&#13;
intensity would unddoubtedly change our results. Third, the analysis assumes&#13;
that labor is a homogenous commodity. In reality labor markets are differen-&#13;
tiated by skill categories. Labor-intensive techniques that place a high&#13;
demand on managerial talent may be eschewed if managerial skills are scarce.&#13;
Clearly, a more precise analysis of the determinants of employment needs to&#13;
consider different qualities of labor. Finally, the pattern of employment&#13;
creation has a *bearing on the distribution of income. To the extent that&#13;
equity as well as output growth are legitimate objectives, the desired employ-&#13;
ment pattern may differ from that shown here.&#13;
The necessarily tentative character of the explanations offered&#13;
for the observed patterns and the anaLytic omissions noted above may be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
simply summarized by saying that our observed employment patterns fail to&#13;
reflect important differences in the quality of economic growth. The observed&#13;
trends are too incomplete to be a safe guide to the problem of employment&#13;
creation. These qualifications place the study in its proper perspective as&#13;
providing a necessarily partial contribution to the complex question of&#13;
employment determination.&#13;

APPENDIX A. THE ALGEBRA OF INPUT-OUTPUT ANALYSIS&#13;
Consider an economy disaggregated into n sectors or industries, each comprising&#13;
enterprises producing similar products. 1/ For ease of exposition we assume&#13;
no foreign trade. Let the physical output of sector i be represented by Xi,&#13;
and let Xij represent the amount of the output of sector i absorbed by sector&#13;
j as an input. 2/   In acldition we define Yi as the quantity of sector i is&#13;
product delivered to final demand. The balance between production and sales&#13;
is defined by the following accounting identities:&#13;
(1)            Xli + X1,&gt; + X13+ Â°    + Xln + Y1     X1&#13;
X21 + X22 + X23 +      + X2n + Y2     X2&#13;
X31 + X3! + X33 +   .+ X3n + Y3       X3&#13;
xnK  + Xn:2 + Xn3+     + XT  + Yn     Xn&#13;
Assume that the production function for each sector permits no substitution&#13;
so that the general procluction function of the form:&#13;
1/   For a more precise statement of the conditions that should characterize&#13;
the industries-included in each sector, see for example W. Duane Evans&#13;
and Marvin Hoffenberg, "The Interindustry Relations Study for 1947,"&#13;
The Review of Economics and Statistics, vol. 34, no. 2 (May 1952),&#13;
pp. 97-142.&#13;
2/   Most interindustry tables are of course expressed in value rather than&#13;
physical units. UnrLder certain assumptions the transformation from physi-&#13;
cal to value units is straightforward. If relative prices change, in-&#13;
cluding exchange raLtes, the representativeness of coefficients expressed&#13;
in value terms is called into question. It also is difficult to compare&#13;
value coefficients across countries with differing relative price struc-&#13;
tures.&#13;

(2a)                   Xj      f (X ;, X2;, ..., X n)&#13;
takes the form of minimum requirements for each input:&#13;
(2b)                       X    &lt;  X_   ai&#13;
If efficiency is assumed, no more than the limitational amount of any input&#13;
would be used, so that the partial relation of (2b) reduces to:&#13;
(2c)                       Xij   =  aij Xi,&#13;
where aij is the direct input coefficient of industry i into industry j.&#13;
Thus aij measures the quantity of the output of industry i required by&#13;
industry j per unit of output.      Substituting (2c) into (1) we obtain:&#13;
(3)        a   X   +a    X + aa2  X3   +... + aln Xn + Y1        X1&#13;

If it is assumed that the levels of final demand (Yi) are exogenously given,&#13;
these n equations can be solved for the n unknown production levels. The gen-&#13;
eral solution can be presented as:&#13;
(4)         X    =  r11 Y1 + r2 Y     + r13 Y3+       + rln Yn&#13;
X2  =   r21 YI+ r22 Y2+ r23 Y      +    .+ r2    Y&#13;
X3   =  r31 Y1 + r32 Y2+ r33 y3 +.        + r3   Y&#13;
X n     r   Y  + r    Y  + r    Y  +   .+ r      Y.&#13;
n       nl  1     n2  2     n3  3            nn  n&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
The rij coefficients are the direct-plus-indirect coefficients, which meas-&#13;
ure the direct and indirect output of sector i needed to increase the delivery&#13;
made by sector j to final users.    In general each rij in solution (4) depends&#13;
on all the input coefficients aii.&#13;
Once the production levels, X1, X2, X3, ..., Xn, in each sector*cor-&#13;
responding to each compconent of final demand are known, the corresponding&#13;
factor requirements are easily determined from factor input coefficients.&#13;
Assume that the employment requirements of an industry are proportional to&#13;
its output. Then if Li denotes the total employment in industry i, its&#13;
labor-input coefficient, Qi' is defined as:&#13;
(5a)                      ti  =   i, or                        (i = 1,2, ..., n)&#13;
i&#13;
(5b)                       Li =  Qi X1&#13;
Employment in each industry can be related to the components of&#13;
final demand by substituting the values given for Xi in (4) into (5b):&#13;
(6)  Li  = 2.irilY1 + Z Iri2Y2 + ... + 2ir inYn        (i = 1,2, ..., n)&#13;
Thus when final demand for the product of sector j increases by one unit,&#13;
employment in sector i Increases by   Qi rij (i = 1, 2, ..., n) and the&#13;
employment in the economy increases by    Z.   Qi ri    The latter is the&#13;
total (direct-plus-indirect) labor coefficient (L) corresponding to a unit&#13;
increase in final demand for the output of sector j.&#13;
The foregoing can be more succinctly summarized in matrix notation.&#13;
Let A be the matrix of coefficients aL J and let I be an identity matrix, with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
ones down its diagonal and zeros elsewhere. The column vectors X and Y stand&#13;
for arrays:&#13;
xl                 y1&#13;
x2                 y2&#13;
X  'X3             Y  = y3&#13;
x2                 y&#13;
Rewrite equation set (1) as:&#13;
(7a)                            AX + Y = X,&#13;
which can be rewritten as:&#13;
(7b)                          (I - A) X   Y.&#13;
Let the inverse, (I - A)   , be defined as matrix R.   Multiplying (7b) by&#13;
the inverse, solve for X as follows:&#13;
(8a)                       X  -  (I - A)  Y&#13;
(8b)                          = RY,&#13;
where each element of R is rij. Multiplying a row vector of direct labor&#13;
coefficients (L) by R yields the total, or direct-plus-indirect, labor coeffi-&#13;
cients.&#13;
It is important to realize that the indirect effects on domestic&#13;
resources, labor and capital, are moderated through leakages to imports.&#13;
To estimate the total employment effect of output expansion, the coefficient&#13;
matrix, A, should relate only to domestic intermediate inputs purchased per&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
unit of output. Thus if A denotes a matrix of technically determined inpwt-&#13;
output coefficients, including both imported and domestically produeed inter-&#13;
Ad&#13;
mediate inputs, it is poosible to define Ad, the matrix of domestically&#13;
produced intermediate inputs, as:&#13;
d  =m&#13;
(9)                     IA      A - A&#13;
where Am is a matrix of import coefficients. The import coefficients&#13;
reflect purchases from ncondomestic suppliers per unit of output. As the&#13;
economy's structure becomes more developed, the relative importance 6f&#13;
imported supply will decline for some inputs. The inverse matrix, R, required&#13;
to calculate direct-plus--indirect labor coefficients is now given by:&#13;
(10a)                      X  =  (I - A )  Y&#13;
(lOb)                      X  = Rd Y&#13;
Put in its simplest terms, the above formulation recognizes that imported&#13;
intermediate inputs do not generate domestic employment.&#13;

Note:     Because the total labor coefficients are declining, a negative value&#13;
indicates a contribution to an increase in those coefficients. In&#13;
addition, agriculture has been excluded for reasons specified in&#13;
the text. Subtotals may not reconcile with totals because of rounding.&#13;

            With the input-output tables of the U.N.
            world model, by themselves and in conjunction with data
            derived from regression equations for production in an
            average country, it is possible to elicit some average
            patterns of employment associated with rising levels of per
            capita income. These average patterns neglect differences in
            country size, resource endowment, foreign trade,and
            development strategy. They nevertheless can provide some
            indication of the effect of investment in a given sector on
            employment in that sector and in the entire economy.
