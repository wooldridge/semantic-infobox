Description&#13;
This Annex shall be applicable to and form an integral part of all administration agreements for the&#13;

Agreement") between the Bank and any entities that provide any funds to the Trust Fund&#13;
(collectively, the "Donors").&#13;
1. Objectives&#13;
SABER-UF will enhance and extend the SABER initiative, which was formulated to help&#13;
developing countries accelerate learning for all by strengthening education system policies and&#13;
institutions using innovative, standardized, and comparable analytics built on research, evidence,&#13;
and cross-country experience within a public goods framework. SABER is designed to assist&#13;
countries to identify the policy constraints that limit the performance of their education systems as&#13;
well as the policy actions that they may take, or that comparator countries have taken, to improve&#13;
performance. The SABER initiative covers a number of key areas of education policy, referred to as&#13;
"policy domains." SABER-UF is intended to deepen or add to the policy domains already&#13;
incorporated in SABER, such as:&#13;
- Teachers,&#13;
- Student Assessment,&#13;
- Early Childhood Development,&#13;
- Workforce Development,&#13;
- Education Management Information Systems,&#13;
- Engaging the Private Sector,&#13;
- School Autonomy and Accountability,&#13;
- School Finance, and&#13;
- School Health and School Feeding.&#13;
With SABER-UF support, the Bank will be able to develop one or more additional policy domains&#13;
into the SABER initiative, which may include Equity and Inclusion, Education Resilience&#13;
Approaches (for education and fragility), Tertiary Education Systems, Information and&#13;
Communication Technologies, and Student Learning Standards.&#13;

this Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the&#13;
Donors, including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a&#13;
fiduciary or trustee under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration&#13;
Agreement shall be considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its&#13;
Articles of Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2   Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in&#13;
accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from&#13;
time to time, including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard&#13;
policies, its framework to prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to&#13;
prevent the use of Bank resources to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to&#13;
give effect to the relevant decisions of the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of&#13;
Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this provision does not create any&#13;
obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules&#13;
and executive orders of an individual member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.    Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1   The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall&#13;
be kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may&#13;
be commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as&#13;
trustee, has legal title to the funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2   The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States Dollars (the&#13;

respective Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency&#13;
other than the Holding Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying&#13;
Deposit Instructions, the Bank shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the&#13;
exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be&#13;
insufficient to complete activities as a result of exchange rate fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the&#13;
Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any additional financing.&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

disbursement in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment&#13;
of trust funds administered by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment to&#13;

Installment, an amount equal to five percent (5%) per Installment as an administrative fee for the&#13;
Trust Fund.&#13;
3.3   Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust&#13;
Fund Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual&#13;
Contributions significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of&#13;
the first Administration Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs&#13;
change, the Bank reserves the right to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and&#13;
Costs section, which would be effectuated by amendments made to the Administration Agreements&#13;
of all Donors and which would thereafter be applicable to all new Contributions that are provided&#13;
either as amendments to supplement existing Administration Agreements or from new Donors&#13;
under new Administration Agreements.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿cash-based trust funds as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial statement for all cash-based trust&#13;
funds together with the Bank's external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of the single audit shall&#13;
be borne by the Bank.&#13;
4.4   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the&#13;
Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether&#13;
such an external audit is necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope&#13;
and terms of reference of such audit. Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the&#13;
Bank shall arrange for such external audit. The costs of any such audit, including the internal costs&#13;
of the Bank with respect to such audit, shall be borne by the requesting Donor.&#13;

within the limits of the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including&#13;
any costs incurred by the Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is understood that any such review&#13;

after such date to the extent such date is changed in accordance with amendments made to the&#13;
Administration Agreements of all the Donors. Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank&#13;

manner specified in its respective Administration Agreement on a pro rata basis with regard to the&#13;
total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by such Donor relative to the total funds deposited in the&#13;
Trust Fund by all Donors, all calculated as Holding Currency amounts.&#13;
