1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1  Investigations of the Shule River Basin in Hexi Corridor for irrigated agriculture&#13;
development and land settlement were carried out by Gansu in the early 1950s, followed&#13;
by decades of project planning, ad hoc and increasingly better planned implementation,&#13;
and review. The Gansu Provincial Study conducted by the Bank Group in 19851&#13;
concluded that irrigation development in Hexi Corridor would be a logical means of&#13;
alleviating poverty and significantly reducing provincial food deficits. Since then,&#13;
various Bank Group missions, while supervising the ongoing Gansu Provincial&#13;
Development Project (Agriculture Component) Ln. 2812/Cr. 1793-CHA of FY87, had&#13;
discussed the project and guided Gansu in project preparation for ultimate Bank Group&#13;
financing. The proposed project in Shule River Basin has been identified to have high&#13;
developmental potentials and has long been supported by the Bank Group. However, due&#13;
to Gansu's counterpart funding constraint, the proposed project was only finally accepted&#13;
by the central government for Bank Group financing in the FY96 lending program as the&#13;
earlier poverty-oriented project approached completion. The project was prepared in&#13;
September 1994, preappraised in May 1995, and appraised in September 1995.&#13;
B. SECTORAL OBJECTIVES AND BANK LENDING&#13;
1.2   China's agriculture feeds a population of about 1.2 billion. Land resources are&#13;
scarce (about 0.1 hectares-ha-per capita). Water resources, although abundant in the&#13;
south, are scarce in the north and northwest, limiting expansion and development of&#13;
agriculture. Agricultural reform, begun in 1978, has helped to reduce the incidence of&#13;
rural poverty by about 170 million people, from 270 million to about 100 million people&#13;
by 1985. However, since 1985 there has been only a small decline in the incidence of&#13;
absolute poverty. The earlier gains in rural incomes have come mainly from areas&#13;
endowed with favorable natural resources, whereas the mountainous regions of southwest&#13;
and northwest China remain poor due to harsh natural elements and relative&#13;
overpopulation. China's poverty reduction strategy is now focused on raising incomes&#13;
and living standards of people in these poor regions through investment in agriculture and&#13;
land development, rural works and enterprises, provision of basic social services, and&#13;
facilitation of emigration to better favored areas.&#13;
See World Bank Country Study entitled "China-Growth and Development in Gansu Province," World&#13;
Bank, Washington DC, 1988.&#13;

1.3   Bank Group lending for agricultural projects with direct poverty alleviation&#13;
interventions include:   Northern  Irrigation  (Cr. 1885-CHA), Gansu Provincial&#13;
Development Project (Ln. 2812/Cr. 1793-CHA), Loess Plateau Project (Cr. 2616-CHA),&#13;
Southwest Poverty Reduction Project (Ln. 3906/Cr. 2744-CHA) and Shanxi Poverty&#13;
Alleviation Project (FY96). Other agricultural projects that include poverty reduction&#13;
subprojects in numerous extremely poor counties are:   Shandong Agricultural&#13;
Development Project (Cr. 2017-CHA), Shaanxi Agricultural Development Project&#13;
(Cr. 1997-CHA), Henan Agricultural Development Project (Cr. 2242-CHA), Tarim Basin&#13;
Project, Xinjiang (Cr. 2294-CHA), Guangdong (Cr. 2307-CHA) and Sichuan (Cr. 2411-&#13;
CHA) Agricultural Development Project.  These projects have made a real and&#13;
sustainable contribution to poverty reduction, with the Northem Irrigation Project doing&#13;
so in part by assisted emigration of poor upland peasants to newly irrigated areas (para.&#13;
1.9)&#13;
C. IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE IN CHINA&#13;
1.4   China achieved rapid expansion of irrigated farmland from the early 1950s to the&#13;
mid-1980s. Through expansion in irrigation, the effective irrigated area increased from&#13;
about 20 million ha in 1952 to 33 million ha in 1965, 45 million ha in 1976 and 48.5&#13;
million ha in 1984. However, after 1985 the area declined and stagnated at about 45&#13;
million ha due to a net loss of cultivated land to nonagricultural use (including some land&#13;
which should never have been developed, now reverted to grassland) and reduced&#13;
investment in water resources development by both central and local governments. The&#13;
productivity of irrigated land is about twice that of rainfed land as irrigation allows both&#13;
higher cropping intensities and higher yields. Irrigated agriculture accounts for about two&#13;
thirds of total grain production and three quarters of commercial crop production.&#13;
1.5   Despite past successes, China continues to face problems in the irrigated&#13;
agriculture sector. Continued depletion of water resources, coupled with degradation of&#13;
water quality by industrial pollution and chronic uneven regional distribution of water&#13;
resources, continues to constrain irrigated agriculture development and expansion. Many&#13;
of the large schemes constructed in the 1950s and 1960s in haste are aging fast and need&#13;
rehabilitation. Operation and maintenance in many areas are still inadequate due to the&#13;
insufficient resources allocated. The government's short-term strategy is to selectively&#13;
improve and rehabilitate some of the more urgent and priority areas that would provide&#13;
quick returns with minimum investment, while the long-term plan calls for interbasin&#13;
transfer of water to resolve regional water shortages. There is still potential for increasing&#13;
production from existing irrigated farmland through better water management and higher&#13;
irrigation efficiency. New irrigated agriculture development would be limited and&#13;
confined to smaller river basins with adequate water resources.&#13;
D. IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE AND POVERTY IN GANSU PROVINCE&#13;
1.6   Gansu, located in the northwest arid region, is a resource poor province with a&#13;
population of 22.6 million, 84 percent of which is rural. Agricultural production is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
largely affected by harsh natural elements (topography, climate, land and water) and a&#13;
weak production infrastructure. The province is deficit in food grain production. Over&#13;
the last two decades the province had to import grain to feed its increasing population,&#13;
especially those in the upland areas of central and southeast Gansu where the harsh&#13;
climate and marginal land and water resources cannot sustain an increasing population.&#13;
Of the 3.5 million ha of cultivated land, only about 1.07 million ha are irrigated. It is&#13;
planned to increase the total irrigated land to about 1.25 million ha by 2000 and 1.33&#13;
million ha by 2010.&#13;
1.7   The province has 41 officially identified absolute poor counties with about 4.26&#13;
million people living below the absolute poverty line and depending on government relief&#13;
for food, clothing and fuel. Although some progress has been achieved under the poverty&#13;
reduction programs of the "Two Xi"2 Commission since 1983, much more needs to be&#13;
done. The province has formulated a seven-year plan to reduce the incidence of poverty&#13;
for about 4 million people. The 1,000 kilometer (km) long Hexi Corridor in the&#13;
northwest region of the province (the route of the ancient Silk Road), with its favorable&#13;
climate and better resources, offers a long-term solution to reducing the province's deficit&#13;
in food grain and alleviating poverty.&#13;
E. RATIONALE FOR BANK GROUP INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.8   The project would directly address two of the Bank Group's main operational&#13;
priorities in China-poverty alleviation, and environrnental enhancement and protection.&#13;
The project is also consistent with the current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) and the&#13;
Progress Report of March 26, which supports in-situ income-generation programs in&#13;
lagging provinces, upgrading of marginal agricultural lands, major water storage, and&#13;
irrigation and drainage development. This is in line with the strategy jointly developed&#13;
by the government and the Bank for reducing absolute poverty in the 1990s.3 It&#13;
complements the government's Ninth Five-Year Plan and addresses two of the key&#13;
challenges facing rural development in China: relative stagnation of income growth in&#13;
rural area, and large-scale water shortages in the north and west.  Bank Group&#13;
participation in the project will play a key role in developing a prototype large-scale&#13;
settlement project integrated with irrigated agriculture in the Hexi Corridor of western&#13;
Gansu Province where large tracts of land exist for potential future development, for&#13;
example, the Corridor's Hei River Basin has potential of similar settlement development&#13;
for poverty reduction for 80,000 to 100,000 people. The project would also serve as a&#13;
development model for rational use of limited land and water resources in small self-&#13;
contained river basins in the water scarce regions of Northwest China. In addition, Bank&#13;
2 The two Xis refer to Dingxi Prefecture and Hexi Corridor.&#13;
3 Close collaboration was established resulting from the 1992 sector study "China: Strategies for&#13;
Reducing Poverty in the 1990s" and the "International Conference on Poverty Issues in China" held in&#13;
Beijing, November 1992.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
Group involvement would provide access to the Bank Group's (and international&#13;
consultants') experience and technologies in development of irrigated agriculture for arid&#13;
regions, settlement planning and management, and environmental protection and&#13;
management.&#13;
F. LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
1.9   The Bank Group has assisted China in financing various agricultural projects&#13;
aimed at raising incomes and living standards in the rural areas. These projects have been&#13;
or are generally being implemented efficiently with benefits and performance exceeding&#13;
appraisal estimates. In Northwest China, the Yinan component of the Northern Irrigation&#13;
Project (Cr. 1885-CHA), in neighboring Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and the&#13;
agricultural  component  of  the   Gansu   Provincial  Development  Project&#13;
(Ln. 2812/Cr. 1793-CHA) have direct poverty reduction programs to settle a total of&#13;
135,000 people from resource-poor areas to newly developed irrigated land. Settlement&#13;
of 55,000 people in the Yinan component has been successfully completed and that for&#13;
the Yindaruqin component (Gansu) with 80,000 people has just begun due to belated&#13;
completion of the irrigation facilities, involving construction of major civil works over&#13;
mountainous terrain (90 km of Feeder Channel comprising 39 tunnels, pipe siphons,&#13;
aqueducts and lined canals). The relative success of these Bank-financed agricultural&#13;
projects can be attributed to a high degree of commitment by local governments at all&#13;
levels, effective project planning, design and management, and active participation by&#13;
local communities and project beneficiaries.&#13;
1.10 A recent Bank mission4 to assess the results and impacts of poverty-reduction-&#13;
through-voluntary-resettlement programns in Ningxia implemented under the Bank-&#13;
financed Yinnan Component of the Northern Irrigation Project (Cr. 1885-CHA) found the&#13;
results to be very positive in reducing absolute poverty and providing greater level of&#13;
incomes after resettlement on newly irrigated land. The investment has been cost-&#13;
effective with quick realization of benefits. The mission also found that the large number&#13;
of Hui minority people resettled have not only maintained their cultural and religious&#13;
integrity, but further rebuilt and strengthened them with their increased incomes, which&#13;
they could not afford in their former villages. Key issues identified by the mission&#13;
include: (a) newly irrigated land to be provided to each settler should be allocated to&#13;
achieve either high incomes or a greater number of beneficiaries; and (b) programs should&#13;
not exceed the carrying capacity of the existing available resources. Gansu's project staff&#13;
planning the settlement component have visited and studied the successful voluntary&#13;
resettlement programs completed for 55,000 people under this Bank-financed project in&#13;
Ningxia.&#13;
4 The Bank mission comprising Alan Piazza (EA2RS), Zou Youlan (EA2CH) and Lin Zongcheng&#13;
(Consultant Anthropologist) visited Ningxia November 5-10, 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
1.11   Gansu's own experience in poverty alleviation through land settlement were both&#13;
negative and positive. The failures5 of earlier settlement in Hexi Corridor implemented in&#13;
the late 1950s and 1960s were attributed to the involuntary nature of settlement,&#13;
inadequate planning, lack of supporting services and infrastructure, and settlers not able&#13;
to adapt to the new environments. The more successful poverty reduction programs were&#13;
those carried out by the Two Xi Commission since 1983 with better planning and&#13;
resources. Some 337,000 people have been settled since 1983, the majority of them in&#13;
the Hexi Corridor. Local community leaders and project planners are still mindful of the&#13;
initial settlement failures in Hexi and the inherent risks involved without adequate&#13;
planning and provision of essential support services. Experience and lessons learned&#13;
under the Two Xi Commission poverty reduction programs carried out over the last&#13;
decade have been reflected in the planning and design of the voluntary settlement model&#13;
for the proposed project.&#13;
1.12 From Bankwide experience, the OED's review (No. 72, September 1994) of five&#13;
completed transmigration projects in Indonesia provides useful guidelines for the&#13;
planning and design of the Hexi Corridor settlement component. Though socioeconomic&#13;
conditions, project designs and programs are somewhat different, some of the findings&#13;
and lessons identified by OED are relevant. These include: (a) security of guaranteed&#13;
incomes for settlers is more important than levels of income, (b) proper and thorough&#13;
field investigations should be undertaken prior to settlement, (c) greater settler&#13;
participation in project development and more opportunities for income-generation&#13;
activities for women are required, (d) a strong and stable institution is needed with a clear&#13;
settlement strategy and plan to ensure successful implementation, (e) there must be a&#13;
gradual buildup of local capacity, supported by adequate resources, to absorb the large&#13;
transmigrating society, and (f) more attention should be paid to protection of the&#13;
environment. The above relevant OED findings and lessons have been reviewed with&#13;
Gansu project planners whose voluntary emigration and settlement plan has already taken&#13;
most the above findings and lessons into consideration.&#13;
5 During the Great Leap Forward period (1958-59), a large number of settlers from densely populated&#13;
agricultural areas of Southeast China were settled in the Hexi Corridor as a means of reducing&#13;
population in southeast China and increasing labor availability in Hexi Corridor. However, many of the&#13;
settlers left and returned to their home areas by the early-1960s. A similar failure occurred in the late&#13;
1960s when a number of youths from Tianjin were sent to the Hexi Corridor; they were only permitted&#13;
to return to Tianjin in the early 1980s.&#13;

2. THE PROJECT AREA&#13;
A. LOCATION&#13;
2.1   The proposed project area, located in the Shule River Basin in the farthest western&#13;
corner of the Hexi Corridor in Gansu Province, is administered by Anxi County and&#13;
Yumen City of Jiuquan Prefecture. It is bordered on the west by Hami District of&#13;
Xinjiang Autonomous Region, on the north by Inner Mongolia and on the south by the&#13;
Qilian Mountains in Qinghai Province. IBRD Map No. 27591 shows the general location&#13;
of the project area.&#13;
B. CLIMATE, TOPOGRAPHY AND SOILS&#13;
2.2   The project area has an inland arid continental climate with short hot summers&#13;
and long cold winters. Annual total rainfall ranges from 50 to 70 millimeters (mm)&#13;
against annual total evaporation of 3,000-3,200 mm. The frost-free period ranges from&#13;
117 to 182 days, averaging about 140 days. This restricts agriculture to only one main&#13;
crop per year.  However, long sunshine hours (2,960-3,260 hours annually) and&#13;
abundance of solar energy are very conducive for vegetative growth during the planting&#13;
season. More detailed climatic data are given in Annex A, Table 1.&#13;
2.3   The total proposed Shule River watershed area is about 4,130 square kilometers&#13;
(kmtn) with about 1,330 km2 located above the proposed Changma Dam site. The middle&#13;
reach (1,200 knm) and the lower reach (1,600 km2) contain three existing partially&#13;
developed irrigation districts with ground elevation ranging from El. 1,100 to 1,600 m.&#13;
The proposed project area is generally flat, consisting of alluvial, deluvial and alluvial fan&#13;
plains with higher relief sloping from south to north. Ten south-north gullies of 4-10 m&#13;
deep intersect the plains. Fringing the project area are the Gobi Desert and permanent&#13;
and semipermanent sand dunes. Strong wind, sand storms and scorching heat waves are&#13;
common occurrences, especially in Anxi County located in the west of the project area.&#13;
2.4   Primary soil materials are of alluvium and silt with secondary materials of aeolian&#13;
and red clay of the Tertiary Period. The various soils are classified in Annex A Table 2.&#13;
Soil nutrients are low in nitrogen, deficient in phosphorous and relatively low in organic&#13;
content. Appropriate soil improvement and dressing would be required for optimum crop&#13;
production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
C. WATER RESOURCES&#13;
Surface Water&#13;
2.5   There are two major rivers in the project area: Shule and Chejin Rivers. The&#13;
average long-term runoff of Shule River, measured at Changma Station, is about 1,031&#13;
million cubic meters (Mm3) and that of Chejin River, measured at Shiyou Gorge Station,&#13;
is about 51 Mm3. Yearly and seasonal distributions are not even, with about 53 percent&#13;
of annual quantity occurring during July-September, about 8.5 and 10 percent during&#13;
winter and spring for the Shule River. The total annual runoff varies from 536 Mm3 for&#13;
dry years (1956-57) to 1,507 Mm3 for abundant water years (1972-73). The long-term&#13;
(1952-89) average flow per second is 32.8 cubic meters per second (cms), with a&#13;
maximum annual average of 47.8 cms and minimum of 17.0 cms. Presently, the main&#13;
Shule River is not fully regulated and only about 42 percent of its annual runoff is&#13;
diverted for agricultural and domestic use. Chejin River has been fully used with its flow&#13;
in the upper reaches, the Shiyou River, extracted for industrial and urban uses. Only a&#13;
limited quantity in the lower Chejin River flows into the existing Chejinxia Reservoir&#13;
used for irrigation.&#13;
2.6   Water quality of Shule and Shiyou Rivers has been monitored by four sampling&#13;
stations on each river. Their results are presented in Annex D Table 5. For the Shule&#13;
River, despite a relatively high concentration of zinc, the water quality is generally&#13;
suitable for irrigation purposes. The water quality deteriorates somewhat after entering&#13;
and leaving the Shuangta Reservoir with a higher concentration of mercury and&#13;
mineralization, but still conforming to the irrigation water quality standard.6 The Shiyou&#13;
River, upper stretch of Chejin River, is presently polluted by 36 points of industrial and&#13;
urban effluent discharges. Actions are in hand to control and abate this water pollution.&#13;
Due to natural dilution while flowing downstream, the water quality improves somewhat&#13;
before entering the Chejinxia Reservoir. With the proposed diversion of 61 Mm3 per year&#13;
from the proposed Changma Trunk Canal to augment the water supply in Chejinxia&#13;
Reservoir, the water quality would be further improved through dilution.&#13;
Groundwater&#13;
2.7   Total groundwater resources are estimated at about 704 Mm3 per year, with&#13;
65 percent from river seepage, 21.5 percent from canal seepage, 11 percent from&#13;
irrigation' infiltration, and the remaining from subterrain flow, storm and rainfall&#13;
infiltration. Present extraction and use of groundwater is rather limited (40 Mm3) due to&#13;
availability of cheaper surface water and the lack of electric energy. Mineralization of&#13;
groundwater varies from 1 to 3 grams/liter and is generally suitable for crop irrigation.&#13;

D. POPULATION, LABOR, FARM SIZE AND LAND USE&#13;
2.8   The 1993 total population in the project areas under Yumen City, Anxi County&#13;
and local State Farms was estimated at about 124,320, with rural population of 105,890&#13;
(85 percent). This includes an immigrant population of 13,150 people. The population&#13;
density at 7.1 persons/km2 is low compared to the provincial average of 49.3 persons/&#13;
km2. Total rural labor force is only about 53,100 and there is a general shortage of labor.&#13;
Landholding per family is comparatively large with an average 0.31 ha cultivated land&#13;
per capita (0.6 ha per capita in state farms). Farming is mechanized to a large extent in&#13;
view of large farm size and labor shortage. The large tracts of potentially arable land are&#13;
capable of absorbing additional immigrant population without affecting the economic&#13;
holdings of the existing population. The basic statistics of the project area are given in&#13;
Annex A Table 3.&#13;
2.9   The present land use of the middle and lower reaches of Shule River is low as&#13;
shown in Annex A Table 4. Out of the total area of 1,932,400 ha, 146,800 ha (7.6&#13;
percent) is used for agriculture and forestry, 150,000 ha (7.8 percent) under pasture,&#13;
6,500 ha (0.3 percent) for residential and industrial use.  Some 1,645,600 ha (85.3&#13;
percent) remain unused, of which 228,500 ha (11.8 percent) is barren arable land suitable&#13;
for reclamation and agricultural development.&#13;
E. RURAL INCOMES AND POVERTY&#13;
2.10  Per capita rural income of the project area (average Y 1,400) exceeds the&#13;
provincial average (Y 430) and the 11 emigrating counties (Y 220-Y 320) in central and&#13;
southeast Gansu. Higher per capita incomes are mainly due to better utilization of&#13;
resources through irrigated agriculture and cultivation of larger landholdings.  The&#13;
200,000 persons proposed for voluntary settlement under the project are now living in&#13;
absolute poverty with per capita income less than Y 300 due to poor resources, degrading&#13;
environment and increasing population. Voluntary emigration and settlement in Shule&#13;
River Basin under the project would alleviate their absolute poverty within three to four&#13;
years and thereafter rapidly enhance their economic well-being to the same level of the&#13;
existing farmers in the project area. Annex A Table 7 compares the demographic and&#13;
socioeconomic situations of Gansu Province, the project areas, and the 11 emigrating&#13;
counties.&#13;
F. PRESENT DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRAINTS&#13;
Irrigation and Drainage&#13;
2.11  Irrigation development in the Shule River Basin dates back to the early Qing&#13;
Dynasty, some 350 years ago. Due to scanty population, large expanse of land and&#13;
primitive irrigation facilities, only about 17,300 ha were irrigated prior to the 1950s.&#13;
Through major reconstructions carried out during 1956, 1966 and 1984, the total area&#13;
irrigated has now been expanded to about 43,300 ha under three irrigation command&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
areas-Changma (25,500 ha), Shuangta (14,500 ha) and Huahai (3,600 ha). The&#13;
irrigation facilities constructed to-date are tabulated in Table 2.1 below&#13;
TABLE 2.1: EXISTING IRRIGATION FACILITIES&#13;
Facilities                         Changma          Shuangta         Huahai&#13;

Lateral Canals (no/kn)             179/341          180/335          88/132&#13;
2.12   The existing Changma Intake diverts about 430 Mm3 annually or about 42 percent&#13;
of the long-term average annual flow of Shule River. About 340 Mm3 is used for&#13;
irrigation in the Changma Irrigation Area, 40 Mm3 is sent to augment the Shuangta&#13;
Reservoir in the Shuangta Irrigation Area and 10 Mm3 for Chejinxia Reservoir in the&#13;
Huahai Irrigation Area. About 40 Mm3 is used for domestic and industrial water supply.&#13;
Other supplementary water sources used include 180 Mm3 from springs and 36 Mm3&#13;
from groundwater.&#13;
2.13   The main constraints confronting the present irrigation system are: (a) due to lack&#13;
of upstream flow regulation of the Shule River, only about 42 percent of the annual&#13;
average is being effectively used with the remaining running to waste, resulting in&#13;
frequent water shortages during the irrigation peak demand periods; (b) the main canal&#13;
systems are aging fast and in poor condition, resulting in low canal system efficiency of&#13;
43 percent to 49 percent; (c) lack of adequate on-farm facilities, leading to poor water&#13;
control and management; (d) lack of drainage facilities for soil salinity control in some&#13;
areas; (e) the West Main Canal in Changma Irrigation Area is a temporary earth channel&#13;
without proper canal control structures and suffers from serious bank erosion and seepage&#13;
losses, and poor water conveyance; (f) the East Main Canal is poorly aligned in its upper&#13;
reaches and needs to be realigned for better water conveyance; (g) problems of frost&#13;
damage to canal concrete-linings need to be resolved; and (h) the overall water&#13;
management standard is low and needs to be improved. The proposed project would&#13;
address the above deficiencies.&#13;
Crop Production&#13;
2.14   Currently, the project area has 43,300 ha of irrigated land. During the 1993&#13;
season, 32,900 ha was planted with various crops with a total output value of Y 235&#13;
million, which represented about 49 percent of the total agricultural output value for 1993&#13;
(see Annex A Table 5). The production came from 13 townships and 4 state farms&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
supporting a total population of 124,320 people (rural population of 105,890). Per capita&#13;
cultivated land by farmers is 0.62 ha (1.00 ha by state farm worker). Cultivation is&#13;
mechanized to a high degree:  plowing 89-100 percent, sowing 77-100 percent and&#13;
harvesting 37-75 percent. Due to the high solar radiation energy and where irrigation&#13;
water supply is assured, the average unit yields7 achieved have been consistently well&#13;
above the province's average yields for various crops (see Annex A Table 6). The&#13;
present production systems are well managed and supported by a satisfactory basic&#13;
agrotechnical extension and support services system at county and township levels (a&#13;
similar system also exists in the State Farm hierarchy). The characteristics of production&#13;
systems are summarized in Annex A Table 8.&#13;
2.15   Crop production models and experience already exist in the project area, including&#13;
that of land settlement by immigrant settlers.  This would undoubtedly facilitate&#13;
reclamation and development of 54,600 ha of new land for irrigated agriculture and&#13;
settlement. The main constraints currently confronting increased crop production are:&#13;
(a) lack of irrigation facilities and water; (b) saline and salinized soils requiring&#13;
amelioration; and (c) frequent sand storms and scorching heat waves. The proposed&#13;
project would attempt to minimize the impacts of these physical constraints.&#13;
Livestock&#13;
2.16   The project area is an important livestock production base in the Province. It has&#13;
large tracts of natural grazing grounds and abundant supply of cultivated pastures and&#13;
crop residues from the irrigated cropland. Current production is mainly by specialized&#13;
households and small household production. The holding stock at the end of 1993 were:&#13;
large animals 31,800 heads, sheep 127,700 heads, pigs 65,000 nos. and poultry 352,500&#13;
birds. Per capita production of meat, egg and milk in 1993 were: 40.6 kg, 10.3 kg and&#13;
1.75 kg. Except for milk (lower by 2.5 kg), the per capita production of meat and egg&#13;
exceeded the province averages by 17.9 kg and 5.9 kg, respectively. However, due to&#13;
increasing demands by tourism and major mining industries and urban centers in the Hexi&#13;
Corridor, the present production can only meet 70 to 75 percent of the demands for meat,&#13;
eggs and milk. It is projected that production would have to increase by 2.03-, 3.2- and&#13;
9.4-fold by the end of 1990s. The processing of feed and forage is generally of small&#13;
scale and low quality. Efficiency of feeds could be improved through appropriate&#13;
blending with fine feeds and concentrates. The Animal Husbandry Department maintains&#13;
a satisfactory veterinary services and technical extension system at county and township&#13;
level to support the production.&#13;
7 The average unit yields for wheat and corn reported for Anxi County and Yumen City for 1989-93&#13;
were higher than those of the state farms. This is due to more intensive cultural practices adopted by&#13;
small family farms, higher inputs and better established on-farm windbreaks that provided oasis effects,&#13;
which are more conducive for crop growth.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Forestry&#13;
2.17  Gansu Province has forest cover of about 8 percent, which is below the national&#13;
average of 12.3 percent. Historically, the Shule River Basin was covered with lush forest&#13;
and pasture, but through years of wars and destruction by man, these endowments have&#13;
long been destroyed. Since the 1950s, the State and provincial government have&#13;
launched campaigns of afforestation, closing off desert for reforestation, controlling large&#13;
tracts of desert and sandy soil areas against grazing for purpose of conserving vegetation.&#13;
The project area has also benefited from the national "Three North" Shelter Belt&#13;
Programs completed under two phases to control desertification in Northeast, North and&#13;
Northwest China. Currently, the project area has 9,971 ha of protective forest, 2,645 ha&#13;
of agroforestry and 2,153 ha of border windbreaks, providing a forest cover of&#13;
4.2 percent. Forestry development and production is generally low cost, labor intensive&#13;
and of simple technology specially adapted for the project area.&#13;
G. INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT&#13;
2.18  Overall, the present agricultural production systems in the project area have&#13;
satisfactory basic institutional support that, however, would need to be upgraded and&#13;
expanded to cope with increased demand under the project. Present status of various&#13;
sectors are summarized below:&#13;
(a)   Irrigation and Drainage Research. Research and experimentation topics&#13;
investigated in the past by various provincial and national units in the&#13;
project area included canal seepage, damage to canal linings by frost&#13;
action and swelling of clayey soil, irrigation application rates, soil&#13;
amelioration methods, and feasibility of subsurface pipe drainage. Results&#13;
of some of the more successful experiments have been used and promoted.&#13;
However, due to lack of resources, these studies have been scaled down&#13;
considerably. Currently, the Shule River Water Conservancy Management&#13;
Office (SRWCMO) still maintains a small experimental station near&#13;
Yumen Township, doing experiments on irrigation techniques as to&#13;
number of irrigation applications, timing, quantity, for different crops with&#13;
the aim to economize use of irrigation water. The project would support&#13;
and strengthen the research and experiment facilities with provision of&#13;
equipment and staff training.&#13;
(b)   Agriculture. Support services for crop production are provided by the&#13;
existing agrotechnical extension centers in Anxi County and Yumen City,&#13;
which have laboratory facilities for soil analysis and other analytical work,&#13;
agrimachinery service stations and seed companies. The Gansu Academy&#13;
of Agricultural Sciences maintains a research station at the prefecture&#13;
center of Jiuchuan and this station serves the needs of the project area.&#13;
Under the leadership and guidance of county, prefecture and province, the&#13;
townships and farms have been able to obtain quality seeds, extension of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
new technology, pest control, and production techniques for high-yielding&#13;
and high-value crops.&#13;
(c)   Animal Husbandry. The project area has 177 technical staff; 14 of which&#13;
are professional and 53 senior and middle level staff. The veterinary and&#13;
technical extension services system consists of two county centers and 19&#13;
township stations. Supporting production are two pasture stations, five&#13;
quality stock breeding farms, two livestock products trading companies&#13;
and two processing enterprises. Further institutional support is provided at&#13;
Jiuchuan Prefecture and provincial levels for research, technical support&#13;
and staff training.&#13;
(d)   Forestry. The Forestry Bureau maintains a total of 157 staff and workers&#13;
in the project area, of which 45 are technical staff. Services are provided&#13;
through the two county forestry technical extension, disease and pest&#13;
control, and seedling centers. The Bureau also operates I forestry farm, 2&#13;
nurseries and 20 township forestry stations.  Research is mainly&#13;
undertaken by the national "Three North" Shelter Belt Program and the&#13;
results disseminated to the project area for application.&#13;
H. INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
2.19 The project area is well served by the existing Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and the&#13;
National Highway No. 312, supplemented by a comprehensive network of roads at&#13;
prefecture, county, township and village levels. Domestic flights from Lanzhou land&#13;
regularly at Jiayuguan and Dunhuang, both fringing the project area.  With the&#13;
completion of the multitrack Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and the provincial fiber-optic&#13;
telecommunication system, transport and communication capacity for the project area&#13;
will be further expanded, thereby facilitating industrial, rural enterprise and agricultural&#13;
development.&#13;
&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1   The main objectives of the project are to: (a) alleviate poverty of some 200,000&#13;
poor farmers from the resource poor areas of central and southeast Gansu Province by&#13;
emigrating and settling on newly developed irrigated land in the Hexi Corridor;&#13;
(b) increase agricultural production in Gansu Province, especially in food grains and&#13;
commodity crops; and (c) protect and restore degraded environments.&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.2   The principal project components are:&#13;
(a)   Changma Dam (55 m high) on Shule River to provide effective storage of&#13;
about 100 Mm3 of water for irrigation and water supply;&#13;
(b)   Irrigation and Drainage-improve facilities for 43,300 ha existing and&#13;
develop 54,600 ha new irrigated land in three irrigation districts;&#13;
(c)   Agriculture-crop production, support services, agrimachinery services&#13;
and livestock production;&#13;
(d)   Land Settlement for 200,000 immigrant farmers from resource-poor areas&#13;
on newly developed irrigated land in 16 new townships and 160 villages;&#13;
(e)   Environmental Protection  and  Management through  afforestation,&#13;
monitoring, soil and water conservation practices; and&#13;
(f)   Institutional Strengthening and Support through provision of staff training,&#13;
technical assistance, equipment, vehicles and essential facilities.&#13;
C. PRINCIPAL FEATURES&#13;
Changma Dam&#13;
3.3   The proposed Changma Dam would be 55 m high with a crest length of 365 m&#13;
and a zoned earthfill embankment with a central clay core. A side channel regulated&#13;
spillway, with three gates (10 x 7.7 m), would have discharge capacity of 1,655 cms. An&#13;
8.0 m diameter concrete-lined 300 m long diversion tunnel on the left abutment to be&#13;
built during the construction stage would be used later for silt flushing purposes. The&#13;
water intake concrete-lined tunnel (5.5 m in diameter x 500 m long), located on the right&#13;
abutment, would divert water for irrigation downstream after passing through a surface&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14-&#13;
powerhouse with a total installed capacity of 14.25 MW (3 Francis turbines; 2 x 6.5 MW&#13;
and 1 x 1.25 MW). Some 8,320 m of buildings and 53 km of access roads will also be&#13;
constructed to facilitate operation and maintenance.&#13;
2&#13;
3.4   The Changma Dam would create a reservoir covering about 12 km of area with a&#13;
total storage capacity of 194 Mm3, out of which 80 Mm  is dead storage. The dead&#13;
storage for siltation is projected to last for 37 years with silt flushing carried out during&#13;
the annual high stage flow, commencing from July to early August. A flow simulation&#13;
study carried out serially using 41 years of flow records (1952-93) of Shule River shows&#13;
that for 34 out of 41 years the surface water resources alone are insufficient to meet the&#13;
projected water demands. Thus, groundwater would be required for supplement. Only&#13;
17 years show a net water deficit over the conjunctive supply of surface and groundwater.&#13;
In 14 years, the net deficit is less than 5 percent of the total projected demand, in 2 years&#13;
about 10 percent, and only in one very dry year (1956) does the deficit reach 30 percent&#13;
of the demand. The overall water balance situation is satisfactory. However, the risk of&#13;
drought does exist and a drought crisis management contingency plan would have to be&#13;
included in the operation of the irrigation system (see para. 4.12). On completion, the&#13;
Changma Dam would provide better regulation of flow in the Shule River, thereby&#13;
increasing annual irrigation supply from 430 Mm3 to 926 Mmn3 and the flow utilization&#13;
rate from 42 to 90 percent.&#13;
3.5   Reservoir Resettlement. The Changma Reservoir would require involuntary&#13;
relocation and resettlement of 131 families (566 persons) and acquisition of 172 ha of&#13;
cultivated land. A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been prepared in accordance with&#13;
the provisions of Bank OD 4.30 and submitted to the Bank/IDA (see paras. 3.48-3.49 and&#13;
Annex E for more details). The RAP has been reviewed and accepted by the Bank for&#13;
implementation. A summary of the RAP is given in Annex E.&#13;
3.6   Dam Safety. An international panel of experts (appointed in accordance with&#13;
Bank OMS 3.80) has reviewed the safety aspects of the dam design in April 1995. The&#13;
panel considered the layout and structural design of the dam to be basically safe and&#13;
recommended further refinements to the design, which have now been incorporated in the&#13;
design.' The panel will be retained to review safety aspects of the dam during its&#13;
construction stage. The panel has also reviewed the safety aspects of the two existing&#13;
reservoirs, Shuangta and Chejinxia, and found them to be basically safe for operation&#13;
subject to recommended remedial works being carried out. Gansu has agreed to complete&#13;
these recommended remedial works not later than December 31, 1998. At negotiations,&#13;
assurances were obtained from Gansu Province that it would (a) complete remedial&#13;
works to Shuangta and Chejinxia Reservoirs not later than December 31, 1998; and&#13;
(b) carry out periodic safety inspections of the completed Changma Reservoir, and the&#13;

existing Shuangta and Chejinxia Reservoirs in the project area, according to practices&#13;
and procedures9 acceptable to the Bank/lIDA.&#13;
Irrigation and Drainage&#13;
Irrigation&#13;
3.7   Irrigation facilities would be improved on an existing 43,300 ha and expanded to&#13;
54,600 ha new land to be reclaimed under the following three irrigation areas:&#13;
(a)   Changma Irrigation Area.  The existing Trunk Canal Main Intake&#13;
Complex would be shifted 6 km upstream towards the Shule River Gorge&#13;
and a new trunk canal constructed to connect with the existing one. This&#13;
would reduce the seepage losses in the river channel located between the&#13;
new and existing intake sites. The existing pair of trunk canals (total&#13;
capacity of 65 cms) will continued to be used, but the first 19.4 km of the&#13;
older trunk canal will have its lining of conglomerate stones replaced with&#13;
concrete for better efficiency. A new bifurcation gate is required for the&#13;
East/North Main Canals. A new 49.5 km long lined-canal along a new&#13;
alignment complete with proper canal control structures will replace the&#13;
existing West Canal earth canal which is in very poor condition.&#13;
Connecting to this new canal, four existing and two new submain canals,&#13;
totaling 105.6 km, would be improved and constructed. The East Main&#13;
Canal will have its capacity increased to 7.6 cms, serving ultimately a total&#13;
of 8,020 ha. Part of the canal will be improved by canal realignment and&#13;
replacement of canal lining and control structures. The North Main Canal&#13;
will have its capacity increased to 9.1 cms to increase irrigated area from&#13;
5,467 ha to 10,500 ha. The canal will be extended by about 0.95 km and&#13;
about 10 km of the existing canal will have its damnaged lining replaced.&#13;
The South Main Canal, basically in good condition, will have its capacity&#13;
increased from 4.6 to 6.2 cms to serve 5,800 ha. A total of 196 branch&#13;
canals, totaling 653 km, will be improved and constructed. To take&#13;
advantage of the available hydraulic head, one minihydro power station&#13;
each will be incorporated into the New Trunk Canal (Extension) Intake&#13;
(12 MW installed capacity) and the New West Main Canal Intake (6 MW&#13;
installed capacity). Some 24,600 m 2 of offices and buildings, and 288 km&#13;
of rural roads complete with bridges and culverts will also be constructed&#13;
to facilitate operation and maintenance of the irrigation area. With the&#13;
improved and expanded facilities, Changma Irrigation Area will increase&#13;
from the present 25,500 ha to 56,870 ha.&#13;
9 Periodic safety inspections would be carried out in accordance with Regulation No. 77 on&#13;
"Management of Reservoirs and Large Dams" enacted by China State Council on 3/22/1991.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
(b)   Shuangta Irrigation Area. Primary irrigation works completed include&#13;
the Shuangta Reservoir, Anxi Trunk Canal, South and North Main Canals,&#13;
and 32 branch canals totaling 275 km, 35 percent of which are lined. The&#13;
Shuangta Reservoir, strengthened in 1984 to correct foundation and&#13;
seepage problems, has now a total capacity of 170 Mm3. The reservoir&#13;
will be augmented with 216 Mm3 annually from the Changma Trunk&#13;
Canal with completion of the new Changma Reservoir. The 32.8 km Anxi&#13;
Trunk Canal will have its present capacity increased from 24.5 cms to&#13;
28 cms to serve about 31,070 ha. The South Main Canal will have its old&#13;
intake at the end of the Anxi Trunk Canal replaced and the downstream&#13;
stretch realigned for 18.5 km. Included in the improvement and extension&#13;
are various canal control structures, bridges and flood spillways. The&#13;
North Main Canal, totaling 35.2 km, will have 13.5 km improved, 10.4 km&#13;
expanded, and 11.4 km newly constructed, complete with canal lining and&#13;
ancillary structures. To reduce seepage losses in conveyance, a new&#13;
43.2 km Xihu Submain Canal, starting at the end of the North Main canal&#13;
will be constructed to replace the existing Shule River used to convey&#13;
water to Xihu cotton-growing area. The existing 29 branch canals in&#13;
Shuangta area will be improved for 108 km out of 145 km and some&#13;
97 km will be extended or newly constructed, complete with canal lining&#13;
and control structures. Some 7,500 m2 of offices and buildings, and 40 km&#13;
of rural roads complete with bridges and culverts will also be constructed&#13;
to facilitate operation and maintenance of the irrigation area.  On&#13;
completion, the total irrigation area will be increased from 14,500 ha to&#13;
30,670 ha.&#13;
(c)   Huahai Irrigation Area. Irrigation water is diverted from the Changma&#13;
Trunk Canal via the 43.3 km Shule-Hua Main Canal into the Shiyou River&#13;
and regulated in the downstream Chejinxia Reservoir. The present Huahai&#13;
Irrigation Area intake is located 11 km downstream of the Chejinxia&#13;
Reservoir and about 10.4 Mm3 of water is lost annually through seepage&#13;
along the river channel above the intake. Under the project, it is proposed&#13;
to shift the intake further upstream 5.5 km with a designed capacity of&#13;
7.55 cms. The Huahai Trunk Canal will be expanded for 1.1 km up to&#13;
Chainage 8+650, from there a new 12 km trunk canal of 5.9 cms capacity&#13;
running parallel to the existing trunk canal would be constructed. The&#13;
East Main Canal, 5.25 km long and commanding about 2,000 ha, will have&#13;
its capacity expanded to 1.75 cms. Canal lining, control structures and&#13;
bridges would be improved and added. The West Main Canal will be&#13;
improved for 2.0 km and extended 5.7 km with its capacity increased to&#13;
2.9 cms to serve 3,300 ha. The North Main Canal, 7.7 km long and&#13;
serving 4,646 ha, will have its capacity increased to 4.1 ems.&#13;
Improvement and expansion would include downstream canal bank raising&#13;
and lining replacement. A total of 20 branch canals would be improved&#13;
(37 km) and constructed (57.6 km). Some 3,200 m2 of offices and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
buildings, and 40 km of rural roads complete with bridges and culverts&#13;
will also be constructed to facilitate operation and maintenance of the&#13;
irrigation area. The improved and expanded facilities will increase the&#13;
irrigation area from 3,600 ha to 10,670 ha.&#13;
Canal System Efficiency&#13;
3.8   The present overall canal system efficiency is only estimated at 50 percent&#13;
(Changma 54 percent, Shuangta 43 percent, Huahai 54 percent) due to aging of the canal&#13;
system and incomplete lining of the canal systems. The project designed efficiency is&#13;
62 percent, although somewhat high, but achievable due to the extensive canal linings&#13;
being proposed for the canal network, improved system operation and maintenance, and&#13;
establishment of a computerized system for monitoring, simulation and dispatch of&#13;
irrigation water.  The projected canal system  efficiency would be affected by a&#13;
combination of factors:  soil and topography conditions, size and length of canal&#13;
networks, quality of system construction and canal linings, and standard of operation and&#13;
maintenance. The system efficiency would be progressively built up with completion of&#13;
the irrigation works and, therefore, this would need to be progressively monitored for the&#13;
canal system in each of the three irrigation areas. Project risk and sensitivity analyses&#13;
(para. 6.20) were carried out using a range of lower efficiency (60 and 55 percent)&#13;
evaluated against project benefits (area irrigated and the number of settlers) and the actual&#13;
efficiency achieved and monitored.&#13;
Canal Lining&#13;
3.9   Due to porous and sandy soils, adequate and extensive lining of the canal system&#13;
would be required to achieve the desired canal system efficiency. Most of the lining in&#13;
the existing irrigation areas would be improved or replaced, and new ones constructed in&#13;
the new irrigation areas. Damnage to canal lining caused by frost action and upheaval of&#13;
clayey soil supporting concrete lining during cold winter seasons is a serious problem in&#13;
the project area. Based on past experience learnt and studies carried out, Gansu has&#13;
evolved designs of canal lining to meet different soil and water table conditions. These&#13;
designs have been reviewed by the Bank/IDA and found to be technically sound and cost&#13;
effective. The designs include use of precast concrete panels and slabs, in-situ concrete,&#13;
large conglomerate stones set in concrete, geomembranes and replacement of clayey soil&#13;
materials with gravely and sandy soils of low moisture retention capacity under the&#13;
concrete linings to minimize swelling and upheaval during cold weathers. Details of&#13;
these designs are given in Annex I Appendix 6.&#13;
Drainage and Salinity Control&#13;
3.10  Reclamation of Salinized and Saline Soils. Of the 54,600 ha of new lands to be&#13;
reclaimed, there are about 39,000 ha (71 percent of total) salinized and or having saline&#13;
soils, with area distribution as follows:&#13;

3.11   The reclamation of saline lands will be implemented through leaching of saline&#13;
soils in combination with drainage and agricultural measures. According to experiments&#13;
carried out in the state farms and experience in areas with similar conditions, the leaching&#13;
quotas required for reclamation of soils with different salinity levels are as shown in&#13;
Table 3.1 below.&#13;

3.12   On-farm Drainage Systems. For the reclamation of salinized and saline soils,&#13;
on-farm drainage systems consisting of lateral, sublateral and field drains will be&#13;
constructed. Generally, two layout schemes of irrigation and drainage systems are to be&#13;
adopted: (a) with sublateral drains constructed adjoining to sublateral irrigation canals;&#13;
and (b) with sublateral drains built in between sublateral irrigation canals. For scheme (a)&#13;
the spacings of both sublateral irrigation canals and drains are 250-400 m, while for&#13;
scheme (b) the spacing is 400-600 m. Field drains with depth varying from 1.7-2.2 m and&#13;
spacing of 70-150 m, depending upon the texture and hydraulic conductivity of soils, are&#13;
temporarily constructed during reclamation to accelerate leaching. These field drains will&#13;
be leveled at the maintenance stage. For nonsalinized and light soils, based on the&#13;
experience of state farms and irrigation districts with similar conditions, only sublateral&#13;
drains are required with spacing of 250-400 m. In areas where groundwater of low&#13;
salinity is used conjunctively with surface water, only lateral and sublateral drains are&#13;
necessary to supplement the vertical drainage provided by tubewells. The reclamation of&#13;

54,600 ha wastelands will be implemented over a period of 10 years from 1996 to 2005 (see&#13;
Annex H Table 2).&#13;
3.13 Main and Branch Drains, and Drainage Outlets. In addition to the main Shule&#13;
River and Beishi River carrying drainage to the wastelands lying to the west and north of&#13;
the project area, the existing primary and secondary drainage systems will be&#13;
supplemented with construction of the following additional drains in the three irrigation&#13;
districts to cope with increased drainage from the expanded irrigation area:&#13;

3.16   With the completion of the project, the surface runoff will be regulated by the&#13;
Changma Reservoir and groundwater recharge will come mainly from seepage losses of&#13;
irrigation canals and deep percolation of irrigation water in the field, which are more or&#13;
less uniformly distributed. Therefore, the extraction of groundwater, the number and&#13;
location of tubewells in different areas will be planned according to the groundwater&#13;
recharge in those areas. The groundwater drafted would be used conjunctively with&#13;
surface water. Tubewells would be constructed adjoining to surface irrigation canals to&#13;
augment irrigation canal supply. During periods when canal water is not available, the&#13;
ground water is used for irrigation of vegetables, tree crops and other crops, especially&#13;
during drought when surface canal water supply is limited. Some 730 tubewells would&#13;
be constructed under the project, mostly in the Changma Irrigation District, to&#13;
supplement the surface irrigation water.  The locations and spacing of these new&#13;
tubewells would be subject to detailed investigations.'°&#13;
Water Resources-Supply, Demand and Quality&#13;
3.17   The total water resources available annually in Shule River Basin has been&#13;
estimated at 1,220 Mm 3; 1,082 Mm3 surface water and 138 Mm3 groundwater. Based on&#13;
the demands for ultimate development under the project, the total demand would be about&#13;
1,071 Mm3; 969 Mm3 for agricultural use and 102 Mm3 for industrial and domestic use.&#13;
Table 3.4 below shows the breakdown of use, demand and supply for a normal year&#13;
(P=50%). The surface supply would only be made possible through regulation of the&#13;
Shule River by the proposed Changma Reservoir.&#13;
10 The present groundwater regime will be changed as a result of increased Shule River flow regulation&#13;
and diversion for irrigation to the expanded areas. The future extraction of groundwater should&#13;
preferably be based on results of groundwater model simulation.&#13;

3.18  The overall water quality of the main Shule River" supplying the main bulk of&#13;
water for irrigation is within China's standard GB 3833-88 Grade II for surface water for&#13;
irrigation. As part of the lower stretch of the Shule River is being used to convey water&#13;
to the Shuangta Reservoir for irrigation of Shuangta Irrigation Area, it would be&#13;
necessary to monitor the potential increase in salinity in the Shuangta Reservoir water&#13;
due to planned reclamation of some 10,100 ha of salinized soils drained by this stretch of&#13;
the Shule River.&#13;
Agriculture&#13;
Agricultural Support Services&#13;
3.19 With the immigration of new settlers, the population of Yumen Township would&#13;
be increased by about 30 percent and that of Anxi County doubled. Therefore, the&#13;
investment for agricultural support services would reflect these population changes.&#13;
Moreover, the design and delivery mechanism of agricultural support services would be&#13;
made flexible to meet emerging needs of the migrant settlement development over the&#13;
course of time. Consideration would also be given to promote competitive markets in&#13;
most types of services to be provided by enterprises, companies and specialized&#13;
households. New migrants settled on State Farm administered land would enjoy existing&#13;
support services under the State Farm system which is self-sufficient in most of the&#13;
The water in the smaller Shiyou River has been extensively used by industries and Yumen City and is&#13;
polluted, but only an insignificant quantity is used for irrigation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
services. The proposed agricultural support services under the project are summarized in&#13;
the following subcomponents:&#13;
3.20 Agrimachinery Services. A total of 16 township/subfarm agrimachinery service&#13;
stations would be built progressively over the project implementation period to provide&#13;
agrimachinery services on fee basis to the new migrant farmers. The size and capacity of&#13;
these stations would take into consideration the small-size farm holdings, existing&#13;
capacity of agrimachinery specialized households from adjoining townships, and&#13;
migrants using own machinery and draft animals to meet their needs. The composition of&#13;
the proposed machinery and equipment for each station is summarized in Annex B&#13;
Table 7. It consists mainly of 4 medium-size bulldozers, 1 each scraper and land leveler,&#13;
3 55-hp tractors, 4 plows, 2 harrows and 3 sowing machines for each station. To&#13;
maximize use of machinery, the bulldozers, scrapers and land levelers would also be used&#13;
in land reclamation work, and the tractors for general transportation. Each station will&#13;
have a built-up area of 300 m2 and be equipped with workshop repair facilities. Four fuel&#13;
depots will also be built to serve these stations and the public. These stations will be&#13;
operated and managed by the Provincial Agrimachinery Service Bureau.&#13;
3.21   Seed Production and Processing. Quality seeds are available in the project area&#13;
for all crops, including most of the secondary crops. County seed companies produce and&#13;
sell most of the seeds to farmers; 100 percent of the hybrid corn seeds and 20-25 percent&#13;
of wheat with the remaining being produced by farmers. Only sugarbeet and vegetable&#13;
seeds are imported from outside the county. State farms in the project area produce and&#13;
process their own seeds. To meet increased demands for seeds under the project, it is&#13;
proposed to expand storage, processing and transportation capacity of the existing Yumen&#13;
Township Seed Company, and to equip a seed analytical laboratory. Similar expansion is&#13;
also proposed for the Anxi County Seed Company in addition to setting up a&#13;
multiplication system for quality cotton seed, including 227 ha of seed production farm&#13;
and processing facilities. The county seed companies would be encouraged to contract&#13;
with farmers to produce quality seeds rather than expanding development of their own&#13;
seed farms. In line with the national policy, county seed companies would also be&#13;
encouraged to review and increase their subsidized seed prices so as to make their&#13;
operations more viable and efficient, and as a measure to discourage farmers from&#13;
overseeding when seeds are priced too cheaply. Optimal seeding rate for various crops&#13;
would also be promoted through farmer extension programs and field adaptive research&#13;
and demonstrations. Further support for quality seeds will be provided through a seed&#13;
processing subproject being prepared under the proposed FY96 Seed Sector&#13;
Commercialization Project. This will be located in the project area's Huanghua State&#13;
Farm, with an annual capacity of 12,500 tons, mainly for wheat, hybrid corn and barley.&#13;
3.22  Extension. Yumen Township and Anxi County each have one existing extension&#13;
center with offices for some 15 technicians, soil analysis and plant protection&#13;
laboratories, and classrooms for training activities. The organization setup of the existing&#13;
Anxi County Agrotechnical Extension Center is shown in Chart 4. These two centers&#13;
would be expanded on the basis of number of new migrants coming into the township and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
county. Existing townships have an extension station each staffed with 2 to 4 technicians&#13;
per station making the farmer/technician ratio about 1,000 under Anxi County and 500&#13;
under Yumen Township (compared to 45 under the State farms). Transportation has been&#13;
identified as a major constraint facing county centers and township stations. Therefore,&#13;
sufficient vehicles would be provided under the project. For each of the proposed new&#13;
settlement townships/subfarms, an extension station would be established. Extension&#13;
staff would be trained to man these new stations with appropriate skill-mix and&#13;
experience. The extension programs to be undertaken by the county centers and township&#13;
stations would be based on the integrated training programs planned for the new migrants&#13;
(see Anncex).&#13;
3.23   Research. Research activities to support the agricultural production would focus&#13;
on on-farm applied research for the new settlement areas. This would be undertaken&#13;
mainly by the Jiuchuan Prefecture Agricultural Research Institute, Gansu Provincial&#13;
Academy of Agricultural Sciences located at Jiuchuan on contract with the Project&#13;
Management Office. Topics suggested by the Jiuchuan Research Institute for applied&#13;
research, subject to evolving needs and further detailed investigations, include the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a)   selection and breeding of improved varieties,&#13;
(b)   adaptive research on water-saving irrigation techniques,&#13;
(c)   adaptive research on soil fertility improvement in newly reclaimed areas,&#13;
(d)   follow-up of pest, diseases and weeds,&#13;
(e)   adaptive research on vegetable production,&#13;
(f)   screening of crops and species tolerant to salt and climatic risks,&#13;
(g)   adaptive research to increase the efficiency of agricultural inputs (seeds,&#13;
fertilizer and irrigation water), particularly on wheat, both in the existing&#13;
and the new irrigated areas,&#13;
(h)   cotton pest integrated management, and&#13;
(i)   selection of early, quality wheat varieties.&#13;
The Jiuchuan Research Institute would use existing facilities of the existing county&#13;
extension centers as no new research facility would be provided under the project, except&#13;
for funding of some essential equipment to supplement those to be provided by the&#13;
Jiuchuan Research Institute. Results of successful applied research would be extended to&#13;
farmers through the county extension system.&#13;
3.24  Cost Estimates.  The cost estimates for the above four subcomponents are&#13;
summarized in  ex B Table 9.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
Livestock Development&#13;
3.25  The livestock component would initially focus on strengthening existing&#13;
veterinary and technical-extension services and production of poultry and pigs through&#13;
family farms and specialized households. As the new project areas are developed and&#13;
settled, village (or farm) technical-extension and veterinary service stations would be&#13;
established. At the later stage, commercial livestock production would be undertaken&#13;
through establishment of various demonstration bases in the project area. The main&#13;
subcomponents are summarized as follows:&#13;
(a)   Establishment and Improvement of Livestock Extension Network:&#13;
(i)   expansion and equipping of city/county animal husbandry and&#13;
veterinary service centers for training and extension;&#13;
(ii)   replication of animal husbandry and veterinary stations for the 16&#13;
new townships and subfarms.&#13;
(b)   Included under Overall Project Management:&#13;
(i)   training of city, county and township staff;&#13;
(ii)   training of existing farmers and new  settlers in livestock&#13;
production techniques.&#13;
(c)   Production and Supply of Improved Livestock:&#13;
(i)   layer fertile egg/chick production farm in Yumen City;&#13;
(ii)   broiler fertile egg/chick production farm in Anxi County;&#13;
(iii)   egg hatching facilities in 33 townships/subfarms;&#13;
(iv)   lean boar production farms in Yumen and Anxi;&#13;
(v)   lean sow production farms in 33 townships/subfarms.&#13;
(d)   Fodder Production and Feed Processing:&#13;
(i)   feed and fodder processing in 33 townships;&#13;
(ii)   pasture seeds for farmers;&#13;
(iii)   pasture seed production farms;&#13;
(iv)    grassland fencing of key areas for rehabilitation/protection;&#13;
(v)    watering points to improve utilization of grasslands;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
(vi)   complete protection of temperate deserts (rangeland).&#13;
(e)   Credit for Production: The following credit facilities would be made&#13;
available through the Y 15 million revolving fund provided under the&#13;
Voluntary Settlement Component (para. 3.32):&#13;
(i)   credit for the procurement of improved livestock (specialist&#13;
farmers);&#13;
(ii)   credit for small farmers to procure livestock.&#13;
The cost estimates for each subcomponent and the investment activities for each of the&#13;
existing and new townships are summarized in Annex B Table 10.&#13;
Afforestation&#13;
3.26  The proposed afforestation is primarily to: (a) protect the fragile land from wind&#13;
erosion and enhance eco-environments for crop production and human habitation;&#13;
(b) provide a source of fuelwood energy for the new settlers; and (c) provide soil and&#13;
water conservation measures in the catchment area of the Changma Dam. Upon&#13;
completion, the vegetative cover in the project area would be increased from 4.2 percent&#13;
to 8.5 percent, thereby enhancing the primitive and fragile arid eco-environments in the&#13;
project area. The typical technical designs of afforestation for the project area are given&#13;
in Annex I Table 5. The various proposed subcomponents are summarized below:&#13;
(a)   Eco-environment Protective Forest Belts: To protect and improve the&#13;
fragile eco-environments of the project area, three fringe forest belts&#13;
totaling 236.6 km covering 290 ha in area would be planted. The northern&#13;
project boundary running to the west would have a belt of 115.2 km&#13;
covering 138.2 ha. Planting will be four rows at spacings of 1.5 x 2 m and&#13;
I x 2 m. The northern Anxi County boundary will have a similar four-row&#13;
belt of 86 km covering 103.2 ha. The third belt is located along the East&#13;
Main Canal with a length of 35.4 km and 180.7 ha. In addition, forest&#13;
belts will be planted along three main roads with a total length of&#13;
112.9 km covering an aggregate area of 84.2 ha. The vegetative cover of&#13;
some 109,080 ha of sandy areas and sand dunes would be conserved and&#13;
protected to prevent livestock grazing, thereby helping prevent ingress of&#13;
sand dunes and desertification into the cultivated areas.&#13;
(b)   Wind Protection and Agroforestry: For wind protection of the project&#13;
area, primary and secondary windbreaks, based on main and branch canal&#13;
networks, would be planted. A total of 98 lines of windbreak forest,&#13;
covering 704.7 km and 504.7 ha, would be planted. The 56 primary&#13;
windbreaks, in a south-north direction in line with the prevailing wind,&#13;
would cover a total length of 428.6 km and an aggregate area of 394.7 ha&#13;
with tree planting spacing at 1.5 x 2 m. The secondary windbreaks,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
running generally in east-west direction, total 42 lines of 276.1 km and&#13;
area of 110 ha. In addition, it is planned to plant on-farm single-row tree&#13;
borders based on 5 percent of newly reclaimed area and 2.5 percent of&#13;
existing cultivated area. The total area covered by on-farm tree borders&#13;
would amount to 3,820 ha. Agroforestry would consist of planting of fruit&#13;
trees in residential areas and development of an orchard covering&#13;
3,333.3 ha.&#13;
(c)   Fuelwood Forestry:  As a supplementary source of energy to coal,&#13;
fuelwood trees would be planted at spacing of I m x 2 m along Gully&#13;
No. I to No. 10 with an aggregate area of 1,000 ha. This fuetwood forest&#13;
would provide sustainable harvesting of fuelwood for the new settlers.&#13;
(d)   Soil and Water Conservation Forest: An aggregate area of 3,330 ha&#13;
would be planted with shrubs and trees in gullies and along river banks&#13;
and slopes located upstrearn of the Changma Reservoir area in the vicinity&#13;
of Tien Shen Chiao and Er Tao Chuan so as to reduce soil erosion caused&#13;
by surface runoff, thereby reducing the silting of the Changma Reservoir.&#13;
The dam catchment area has been declared a protected forest area by the&#13;
Gansu Provincial Government. At negotiations, assurances were obtained&#13;
from Gansu that the Changma Dam catchment area in the Qilian&#13;
Mountain Range would be maintained and protected as a protectedforest&#13;
area by December 31, 1998 and at all times thereafter.&#13;
D. VOLUNTARY EMIGRATION AND LAND SETTLEMENT&#13;
3.27  As a means to reduce the incidence of absolute poverty in the province, 200,000&#13;
people will emigrate voluntarily from 11 of the poorest counties in central and southeast&#13;
Gansu and settle on the newly developed irrigated land under the project. At the same&#13;
time, the new migrant settlers would also provide the labor force required for project&#13;
construction and economic development of the project area. Presently, the per capita&#13;
grain production and income in these 11 counties are less than half of the national&#13;
average, and well below the average of Gansu's 41 officially identified poor counties (see&#13;
Table 3.5 below). The land in these upland regions is steep, badly eroded, nonirrigated&#13;
and inaccessible. With increasing population, these counties run large deficits of grain in&#13;
each year and many of the absolute poor in the remote valley villages and townships have&#13;
to rely on annual governnent relief for food, fuel, clothing, etc.&#13;

aLa Figures are for rural population only.&#13;
3.28   A master land settlement plan has been prepared to relocate 200,000 people over a&#13;
period of 10 years. In all, 95 townships with planned quota of emigrants for each&#13;
township have been selected for the emigrating 11 counties (see details in Annex F Table&#13;
2). Within them, prospective settlers would be filly informed of the benefits and risks of&#13;
migration and settlement, their obligations and right to refuse.  Applications for&#13;
emigration would be strictly voluntary, systematically processed (screened by the&#13;
respective village committee, reviewed by township government and approved by county&#13;
government). Selection of settler households would need to meet the criteria'2 established&#13;
by Gansu Government. Some 10 percent of settler households with moderate income and&#13;
education level would also be selected for settlement. Past experience shows that these&#13;
moderate-income settlers would readjust and succeed very quickly in the new settlement&#13;
areas and would be useful to serve as models or lead farmers to others.&#13;
12 The two-stage selection criteria for settler households are:&#13;
First Stage:&#13;
(a) per capita income of less than Y300 and grain production &lt;150 kg;&#13;
(b) at least two workers in the household with head of household between 18 and 50 years of age;&#13;
(c) at least two years of primary education or acceptable literacy level (relaxed for minority applicants);&#13;
(d) experience in agricultural production;&#13;
(e) willingness and positive attitude towards emigration; and&#13;
(f) in good health and mentally sound, not physically handicapped.&#13;
Second Stage:&#13;
(a) per capita income less than Y150 and grain production &lt;50 kg;&#13;
(b) demonstrate intensive desire to emigrate;&#13;
(c) 75 percent of the existing cultivated land is on above 25 degrees slope;&#13;
(d) possess junior middle school education, technical skill and vocational trade training; and&#13;
(e) demonstrate pioneering spirit and leadership.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
3.29 During the first year of emigration, only working members of family would move&#13;
to the new settlement areas to take part in the project construction. Dependents will only&#13;
emigrate during the second or third year after a household head has decided to stay on (he&#13;
would have the option of returning to his original residence within the first two years).&#13;
Each family will contract for at least 30 years 2 mu (0.13 ha) per capita of irrigated land&#13;
for cultivation without any form of repayment. In addition, each family can lease, with&#13;
rent payment13, an additional 1.5 to 2.0 mu per capita, depending on their economic well-&#13;
being and availability of family labor. The lease is subject to renewal after 10 years.&#13;
Each settler family will also be allotted 534 m2 for housing and 667 m2 for planting&#13;
vegetables and fruit trees. Based on a family of five persons, the per capita land allocated&#13;
would be 0.157 ha. Large family farrns, with maximum land holding of 10 ha, would&#13;
also be promoted; but the number would be limited to 150 farms.&#13;
3.30   Each settler will cost about Y 1,100: comprising Y 750 for relocation expenses&#13;
and housing materials, Y 100 for basic water and electricity supplies, Y 100 fuel supply&#13;
for the first two years, and Y 150 for purchase of agricultural tools and production inputs&#13;
during the first year of settlement. New migrant settlers will also be exempted from&#13;
payment of land and agricultural taxes for the first three years of their settlement. The&#13;
new settlers would be placed in 16 new townships to be established in the three irrigation&#13;
districts. Each township will encompass 10 administrative villages, each village will&#13;
have 5 to 10 residential sites with 250-300 families in each residential site, and a&#13;
population of 12,500-13,500 people in each township. During the initial settlement, basic&#13;
education (primary and secondary schools) and health facilities would be provided by the&#13;
project to each township and village. Later, as the settlements stabilize and grow, the&#13;
local governments would provide the other necessary amenities and services.&#13;
3.31   About 25 percent of the emigrant settlers will be from minority groups, mostly&#13;
Islamic Hui and Dongxiang. Although no separate settlement plan has been proposed for&#13;
the minority groups, the relevant provisions of Bank OD 4.20 on Indigenous Peoples&#13;
have been taken into consideration. To maintain their cultural and religious integrity,&#13;
these minority groups will be settled together (as will the majority Han), following as&#13;
much as possible their earlier residential groupings.  This would help the rapid&#13;
reconstruction of social networks in the new settlement areas. The current settlement&#13;
master plan provides for one Dongxiang minority township, and 16 Hui minority&#13;
administrative villages to be established. The minority migrants would also enjoy&#13;
preferential policy incentives, such as relaxation on selection criteria (literacy level),&#13;
priority for employment, credit facilities, and exemption for payment of primary school&#13;
fees and textbooks.&#13;
13 Rent payment for leased land:&#13;
I st-3rd year- zero.&#13;
4th-6th year-Y 75 per 0.1 ha or Y 50 per mu.&#13;
7th-IOth year-Y 150 per 0.1 ha or Y 100 per mu.&#13;

3.32 Under the project, Gansu will use its own funds to establish a revolving fund of&#13;
Y 15 million to provide credit to migrant farmers to assist them in purchasing production&#13;
inputs, operating small rural enterprises and family business. The credit will be of low&#13;
interest (0.24 percent per month) and for short-term period (2-3 years) with a maximum&#13;
amount of Y 2,000 per household so that a large number of migrant households can be&#13;
benefited. Preference would be given to women and minority migrants. The revolving&#13;
fund would be managed by the Agricultural Bank of China and the Rural Credit&#13;
Cooperatives for the Project Office on a fee basis. At negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtained from Gansu that a revolving fund would be established not later than&#13;
December 31, 1996 to provide credit to migrant farmers under arrangements acceptable&#13;
to the Bank/IDA.&#13;
3.33  The existing County Settlement Offices (CSOs) in each of the 11 emigrating&#13;
counties and the host Anxi County and Yumen City will implement, administer and&#13;
manage the emigration and settlement programs entrusted to them by the Project&#13;
Management Bureau (PMB). The CSOs will be responsible to the respective County&#13;
Emigration and Settlement Leading Group (CESLG). A Settlement Advisory and&#13;
Coordination Committee will be established to advise and coordinate with PMB in&#13;
drawing up the annual settlement programs and budgets for implementation by CSOs.&#13;
The Settlement and Social Services Division under the PMB will oversee the&#13;
implementation by CSOs. More details of the organizational and management structure&#13;
are given in para. 4. 10. The Population Research Institute of Northwest China, Lanzhou&#13;
University will monitor the settlement over the project implementation period,&#13;
establishing a database to track the social and economic status and progress of settlers.&#13;
3.34 At negotiations, assurances were obtained from Gansu Province that Gansu&#13;
Province would (a) implement the emigration and settlement plan based on annual&#13;
programs and budget reviewed and agreed by the Bank/IDA, monitor annually the&#13;
progress of implementation and furnish the results to the Bank/IDA not later than&#13;
March 31 of the following year; (b) lease all land distributed to settlers rent free for a&#13;
minimum of 30 years, and (c) lease up to an additional 2.0 mu per capita to settlers on&#13;
1 0-year renewal lease with acceptable rates of rent.&#13;
E. INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT AND STRENGTHENING&#13;
3.35  Training. Staff training would be focused on improving technical competence&#13;
and acquiring technical skills in (a) drainage and water and soil salinity control,&#13;
(b) operation, maintenance and management of large irrigation areas, (c) water resources&#13;
monitoring, simulation and dispatch in Shule River Basin, (d) management of large-scale&#13;
human settlements, and (e) optimization of agricultural production in arid regions,&#13;
covering crops, livestock and forestry. This would be achieved mainly through study&#13;
tours, attendance at international seminars and workshops, and training courses conducted&#13;
by subject specialists. The training programs and estimated costs are given in Annex B&#13;
Table 6. At negotiations, assurance were obtained from Gansu that training would be&#13;
carried out according to a time-bound action plan acceptable to the Bank/IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
3.36  Technical Assistance. Technical assistance in the form of consultant services,&#13;
totaling about 100 person-months of foreign and local specialists as detailed in Annex B&#13;
Table 7, would be provided to assist the Project Management Bureau in: (a) supervision&#13;
of civil works construction of the Changma Dam by ICB contract; (b) planning, design&#13;
and implementation of a basinwide system network for monitoring, simulation, control&#13;
and dispatch of surface irrigation water integrated with the extraction and use of&#13;
groundwater; (c) planning, design and implementation of a basinwide environmental&#13;
monitoring of land and water resources impacted by the project's activities; and&#13;
(d) monitoring and evaluation of new migrant settlers as to their socioeconomic well-&#13;
being.&#13;
3.37 Building, Vehicles, Equipment. The project would build an office complex at&#13;
Yumen Township to house the Project Management Bureau and supporting facilities.&#13;
One county training center each would be built at Anxi and Yumen City for use to train&#13;
project staff at lower levels for all sectors, local leaders and lead farmers in participatory&#13;
aspects of the project development. To ensure and facilitate smooth implementation of&#13;
the project, sufficient quantities of office equipment and vehicles would be provided to&#13;
the PMB, and the county implementing agencies. Details of equipment and vehicles are&#13;
given in Annex B Table 3.&#13;
F. STATUS OF PROJECT DESIGNS&#13;
3.38  Detailed designs complete with bill of quantities for the Changma Dam, the new&#13;
conveyance canal and main intake, and the main canal systems in the three irrigation&#13;
areas have been completed by Gansu Water Resources Design Institute. Further&#13;
refinements to the Changma Dam design, incorporating the recommendations of the&#13;
international dam safety review panel and Bank missions, have also been completed for&#13;
preparation of international competitive bidding (ICB) bid documents to begin in early&#13;
1996. Designs for the main, secondary and tertiary canal systems in the three irrigation&#13;
areas are being undertaken simultaneously by the Yumen Water Conservancy Department&#13;
and Jiuquan Prefecture Water Conservancy Department. They will be completed&#13;
progressively in time for the scheduled construction. Design for the development of the&#13;
resettlement site for relocation of households affected by the Changma Reservoir has&#13;
been completed.&#13;
G. IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
3.39  Due to its physical size, and the need for proper phasing and sequencing of&#13;
various components, the project will be implemented over a period of 10 years between&#13;
July 1996 to June 2006. Major items of construction work would be substantially&#13;
completed and disbursed within the first seven years. The Changma Dam and the&#13;
primary irrigation systems in the three irrigation districts are scheduled to be substantially&#13;
completed within the first four years. However, land development and settlement, on-&#13;
farm irrigation works, livestock and afforestation would be phased out over a period of 10&#13;
years. The project's detailed implementation schedule is shown in Figure 1. At&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained from Gansu Province that a detailed annual&#13;
budget and programs of works would be prepared and furnished to the BanklIDA by&#13;
November 30 of each year, for project implementation in the following year.&#13;
3.40 Reviews of the project implementation in meeting the development objectives and&#13;
target benefits would be conducted at the beginning of 2000 and 2003. The reviews&#13;
would include assessment of expenditures, revised project cost estimates, physical works&#13;
completed and outstanding, and targets achieved. The reviews would recommend&#13;
changes deemed necessary to complete the project. At negotiations, assurances were&#13;
obtained that Gansu Province would prepare and furnish information and data for&#13;
implementation reviews to be jointly conducted by Gansu and the Bank/IDA at the&#13;
beginning of 2000 and 2003, and Gansu would implement the measures agreed after&#13;
each review.&#13;
H. WOMEN IN DEVELOPMENT&#13;
3.41  The female population in the host counties (Anxi and Yumen City) and among the&#13;
200,000 people from the 11 emigrating counties is estimated to be about 47 percent and&#13;
48.5 percent, of which those within the working age group of 15 to 59 years is 74 percent&#13;
and 63 percent. In both cases, the female population has a lower literacy level than the&#13;
male, especially the migrant females who have an illiteracy rate of about 90 percent&#13;
compared to 77 percent of the females in the host counties. Recent surveys show that&#13;
most of the females are engaged in simple and unskilled work, unable to compete with&#13;
males in the skilled and professional fields. Steeped in traditional social prejudice and&#13;
low self-esteem resulting from traditional culture, they are generally not motivated for&#13;
change, less adaptive to new environments, and deprived of social and economic&#13;
development opportunities unless special interventions are made to improve their status.&#13;
3.42  Under the project, special interventions targeted at the migrant female population&#13;
have been designed to change their social and economic status by promoting their&#13;
participation in social and economic development. These interventions include specific&#13;
targets for employment in the public and service sectors, construction industry, township&#13;
and village enterprises, and assistance in the development of small family-run businesses&#13;
and cottage industries. Women migrants will be given preference in obtaining credit&#13;
under the project's revolving fund specially created to assist new migrants (see para.&#13;
3.32). Details of targeted interventions are given in Annex F Table 6.&#13;
3.43  To equip the females for their participatory role in development, emphasis would&#13;
be laid on raising their literacy level through education and vocational training. Primary&#13;
and secondary schools would be built in the new settlement villages and townships to&#13;
ensure that migrant children (including girls) complete the fundamental education. Adult&#13;
females would be encouraged to attend adult education or vocational training classes to&#13;
learn practical skills or techniques so as to broaden their opportunities for work or&#13;
effective self-employment. About 4,000 females or one third of the migrant females to be&#13;
trained are expected to attend vocational training classes. The migrant females would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
also be encouraged to join the Women's Federation (WF) to be established in each&#13;
village. The WFs would organize various socioeconomic activities for their members,&#13;
such as thrift and saving, home science, knowledge learning, literary and art groups, to&#13;
promote members' participation in social activities. This would gradually motivate the&#13;
females, give them more self-confidence, self-respect and decision-making in matters&#13;
affecting them.&#13;
I. ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT&#13;
3.44  The environmental assessments were jointly completed by the Northwest&#13;
Investigation Design and Research Institute of the Ministry of Electric Power and the&#13;
Gansu Provincial Hydroelectricity Investigation and Design Institute of the Ministry of&#13;
Water Resources for Gansu Provincial Government, and reviewed and endorsed by the&#13;
National Environmental Protection Agency in July 1993. Based on the Bank's review&#13;
and recommendations during project preparation (September 1994) and preappraisal&#13;
(May 1995), the assessment reports were further refined and improved into a full&#13;
Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) and an Environmental Impact Summary (EIS)&#13;
submitted to the Bank in July 1995. The Gansu Provincial Government has released&#13;
these two environmental assessment documents to the public.&#13;
3.45  The environmental impact assessment studies have identified both adverse and&#13;
positive impacts. Due to its small component of involuntary resettlement of 131 families&#13;
involving 566 persons affected by the proposed Changma Reservoir, the project has been&#13;
classified a Category A project. A Resettlement Action Plan has been prepared in&#13;
accordance with the provision of Bank OD 4.30 (see paras. 3.48-3.50). The potential&#13;
negative impacts identified are: (a) the reclamation of some 10,100 ha of salinized soils&#13;
for cultivation upstream of the existing Shuangta Reservoir may increase the salinity&#13;
level of water in the reservoir as a result of draining the leachage into the reservoir;&#13;
(b) the interim changes to the groundwater regime (water levels, recharge, yield, quality)&#13;
resulting from higher regulation of the Shule River flow and water diversion for&#13;
irrigation. Other impacts are those associated with construction activities, public health&#13;
and fuel-energy demands for new migrant settlers. The positive impacts identified&#13;
include protection and enhancement of the existing fragile ecosystem through&#13;
afforestation, better and more rational use of land and water resources, and creation of&#13;
''oasis" effects leading to microclimate improvement.&#13;
3.46  Environmental rehabilitation of the source areas in the 11 emigrating counties&#13;
would be carried out by local governments after permanent emigration of selected&#13;
households to the new settlement areas. The rehabilitation measures, mainly related to&#13;
soil and water conservation, would include freezing and prohibition of cultivation of&#13;
steep slope land given up, afforestation, land terracing, planting of shrubs and grass, and&#13;
changing of cropping pattern with less emphasis on grains. Engineering measures, which&#13;
are more expensive, would be avoided or kept to a minimum. The proposed programs of&#13;
works and estimated costs for the 11 emigrating counties are summarized in Annex D&#13;
Table 4. A total of Y 13.5 million (base cost) has been provided under the project based&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
on an average estimated cost of Y 50,000 per km2 for similar works currently carried out&#13;
in Gansu.&#13;
3.47  Based on the discussion between the Bank and the project authority, an&#13;
Environmental Action Plan (EAP) has been prepared to mitigate the negative impacts and&#13;
to provide measures for both short- and long-term environmental protection and&#13;
management of the Shule River Basin. Details of the EAP are given in Annex D. The&#13;
EAP also includes basinwide environmental monitoring of land and water resources, and&#13;
institutional support and strengthening through provision of staff training, monitoring and&#13;
laboratory equipment, and vehicles.   During Bank supervision of the project&#13;
implementation, particular attention would be paid to the monitoring results of land&#13;
reclamation and salt leaching of salinized lands located upstream of the Shuangta&#13;
Reservoirs and it effect on the salinity level of water in the reservoir. At negotiations,&#13;
assurances were obtainedfrom Gansu Province that project activities will conform with&#13;
appropriate environmental practices; and Gansu Province would carry out the&#13;
Environmental Action Plan, monitor the annual programs and furnish the results&#13;
annually to the Bank/lIDA not later than March 31 of the following year.&#13;
J. LAND AcQuISITION AND INVOLUNTARY RESETTLEMENT&#13;
3.48  Land Acquisition. Except for the acquisition of 172 ha of cultivated land to be&#13;
inundated by the proposed Changma Reservoir, there will be no land acquisition for work&#13;
construction in the new proposed irrigation area as the land is currently wasteland, barren&#13;
and uninhabited, belonging to the State. For improvement works in the existing irrigation&#13;
areas, some land would be required for the improvement and expansion works, but this&#13;
would be minimal as most of the canals and drains already have adequate reserves. No&#13;
houses or families will be affected as people only reside in villages, away from canals and&#13;
drains. The 172 ha of land in the Changma Reservoir will be acquired and compensated&#13;
under the RAP (para. 3.50 and Annex.E). Part of the compensation will be used by the&#13;
Yumen City government to develop alternative land for distribution to the relocatees for&#13;
cultivation in the settlement area located in the Huahai Irrigation Area.&#13;
3.49  Involuntary Resettlement. Construction of the proposed Changma Reservoir&#13;
will affect 131 families with a total population of 566 persons. The affected people&#13;
would be relocated and resettled on a 5,580 mu (373 ha) site in the Huahai Irrigation&#13;
Area. A Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) has been prepared in accordance with the&#13;
provisions of Bank's OD 4.30. A summary of the RAP is given in Annex E. The total&#13;
cost for compensation, relocation, resettlement and rehabilitation is estimated at Y 17.5&#13;
million (base cost) or about Y 30,900 per capita.'4 Under the RAP, each relocatee will&#13;
get 4.5 mu of land for cultivation and participate in the joint development and&#13;
management of 2,000 mu of commodity crops (fruits, hops, licorice, etc.). Each&#13;
14 This compares very favorably to compensation paid under other Bank-financed agricultural projects in&#13;
China.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
household will get a housing plot of 635 m2 in the planned resettlement village complete&#13;
with basic infrastructure and amenities. The stakeholders participated in the selection of&#13;
various resettlement sites and general consensus was reached by the relocatees and the&#13;
host village nearby on the site selected. The relocation and resettlement will be carried&#13;
out in two phases; starting in 1998 and completing before the end of 1999 ahead of the&#13;
flooding of the Changma Reservoir in 2000. The socioeconomic well-being of the&#13;
relocatees will be monitored by the National Research Center for Resettlement (NRCR),&#13;
Hehai University, Nanjing for four to five years or until they are satisfactorily&#13;
rehabilitated.&#13;
3.50 At negotiations, assurances were obtained that Gansu Province would carry out&#13;
the relocation and resettlement of people affected by the Changma Reservoir according&#13;
to the Resettlement Action Plan approved by the Bank/lIDA, monitor annually the&#13;
progress and performance, and furnish the results to the Bank/IDA not later than March&#13;
31 of each year.&#13;
K. COST ESTIMATES&#13;
3.51  The total cost of the project is estimated at $259.2 million, of which the foreign&#13;
exchange component is $147 million, or 57 percent. Table 3.6 shows the project cost&#13;
summary and detailed cost estimates of various components are given in Annex B Tables&#13;
1 (a) to I (d).&#13;
3.52  Cost estimates have been derived by applying current unit prices to detailed&#13;
quantity estimates for the main components. Unit prices are based on recent prices for&#13;
similar works carried out in Gansu Province. Equipment costs are based on recent price&#13;
quotations and inquiry. Base costs are estimated with September 1995 prices. For costs&#13;
expressed in US dollars, the expected average price increase is estimated at 2.6 percent&#13;
for 1996-2005, and when the costs are expressed in Yuan the annual rates are&#13;
10.5 percent, 8.5 percent, 7.0 percent, 6.5 percent and 6.2 percent for 1996, 1997, 1998,&#13;
1999 and 2000-05. Physical contingencies of 5 percent have been applied to all items&#13;
except for the Changma Dam, for which 10 percent is allowed.&#13;

La Allocations from Ministry of Water Resources and State Planning Commission.&#13;
3.54   China is eligible for single currency loans under the Bank's expanded program. The&#13;
Government of China and Gansu Province have selected LIBOR-based US dollar single&#13;
currency loan terms for the project in order to facilitate management of the foreign&#13;
exchange risk of their borrowing by more closely matching the currency of their liabilities&#13;
with their net trade flows, about 75 percent of which are US dollar denominated. They&#13;
selected the LIBOR-based product in order to preserve the full maturity of this loan,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36-&#13;
compared to the fixed-rate option that would have resulted in a 15-year loan. The Borrower&#13;
judges that it can manage any interest rate risk. This loan ($60 million), together with other&#13;
already approved FY loans, represents about 2.4 percent of the fiscal year 1996 IBRD&#13;
expected lending to China, and is well within the 50 percent volume guidelines approved by&#13;
the Bank's Board.&#13;
3.55   The loan of $60 million would be for 20 years, including a 5-year grace period at&#13;
the standard interest rate for LIBOR-based US dollar single currency loans. The credit of&#13;
SDR 61.8 million ($90 million equivalent) would be on standard IDA terms with 35&#13;
years' maturity. The proceeds of the loan and credit would be made available to Gansu&#13;
Province for 20 years, including 5 years' grace for the Loan and 7 years' grace for the&#13;
Credit, with interest at the same rates charged by the Bank/IDA for the Loan and the&#13;
Credit.&#13;
M. PROCUREMENT&#13;
3.56   Project procurement will be based  on  the  Bank  Group's latest guidelines&#13;
"Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits, January 1995" (revised January&#13;
1996). Gansu has retained the services of the International Tendering Company of the&#13;
China National Machinery Import and Export Corporation to carry out procurement&#13;
activities for the project. Table 3.7 summarizes the procurement arrangements.&#13;

3.57 Works. Civil works costing $10 million equivalent or more per contract will be&#13;
awarded under ICB. This will involve only one contract for the construction of Changma&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37-&#13;
Dam with an estimated cost of $22.6 million. Qualified domestic bidders competing&#13;
under ICB civil works will be eligible for a 7.5 percent preference in bid evaluation, in&#13;
accordance with Bank Group guidelines on procurement. Contracts costing less than $10&#13;
million and more than $200,000 equivalent per contract will be awarded under NCB&#13;
procedures acceptable to the Bank/IDA. These civil works (estimated $77.3 million in&#13;
total value) comprise numerous packages of small structures, earthworks for canals and&#13;
drains, and buildings spread throughout the project area and would likely not be of&#13;
interest to foreign contractors who, however, will be allowed to bid in these NCB bids.&#13;
The remaining works with an estimated value of $93.9 million, mostly on-farm&#13;
earthworks for tertiary canals and drains, small structures, access roads, land reclamation,&#13;
afforestation, basic water and electric supplies, etc., are scattered over a wide area, labor&#13;
intensive and to be implemented over a 10-year timeframe. As such, they will be best&#13;
procured under contracts awarded on the basis of simplified procedures similar to&#13;
national shopping procedure with at least three price quotations (with less than $200,000&#13;
per contract and aggregate value of $45 million) and, with the prior agreement of the&#13;
Bank/IDA, force account works (up to $48.9 million total) using beneficiary labor&#13;
organized by local governments to participate in the project construction. Progress&#13;
payments for force account works would be based on unit prices and quantities agreed&#13;
annually with the Bank/IDA. Prequalification of bidders for all civil works costing $5&#13;
million or more per contract will be required. Prequalification of bidders for ICB bidding&#13;
of the Changma Dam will be advertised as a specific procurement notice in the United&#13;
Nations Development Business and/or well-known technical magazines, newspapers and&#13;
trade publications of wide international circulation.&#13;
3.58  Goods. All contracts for goods costing $200,000 equivalent or more will be&#13;
awarded under ICB. To the extent practicable, contracts for goods shall be grouped in&#13;
bid packages to cost $200,000 or more each. These contracts include construction and&#13;
agricultural  machinery,  vehicles,  turbine/generators,  transformers,  steel  bars,&#13;
communication and monitoring equipment, with an estimated total cost of $8.6 million.&#13;
Qualified domestic bidders competing under ICB will be eligible for a preference in bid&#13;
evaluation of 15 percent of the c.i.f. price or the actual custom duties and import tax,&#13;
whichever is less. The remainder, mostly small items of office machinery, laboratory and&#13;
workshop equipment, cement and timber would be procured through NCB procedures&#13;
acceptable to the Bank/IDA with an estimated total value of $6.0 million. Building&#13;
materials and production inputs for settlers spread out in 160 new villages (aggregate&#13;
value $13.7 million), a small quantity of machinery, equipment, miscellaneous&#13;
instruments (aggregate value $2.0 million), and livestock and forestry production&#13;
materials (aggregate value $2.5 million) will be procured using national shopping (with at&#13;
least three price quotations) for procurement under $50,000 per contract and international&#13;
shopping (with at least three quotations from at least two different countries) for&#13;
procurement between $50,000 and $100,000 per contract. The aggregate value for&#13;
national and international shopping will not exceed $3.0 million and $1.5 million,&#13;
respectively, for livestock and forestry production materials, machinery, equipment and&#13;
instruments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
3.59 Design, Supervision and Management. Engineering surveys and designs would&#13;
be carried out by local design institutes at provincial and prefecture levels on direct&#13;
contract basis. In addition to department supervision, individual engineering consultants&#13;
would be employed to assist in the supervision of major works. The project management&#13;
element will cover operating costs for office facilities and equipment, vehicles,&#13;
monitoring and evaluation systems. The aggregate cost has been estimated at $5 million&#13;
for surveys and designs, consultant supervision $1 million, and project management $3.7&#13;
million. Only $6.7 million of the total $9.7 million will be Bank-financed.&#13;
3.60 Review of Bid Documents and Contracts. Bid documents"5 for all civil works&#13;
in excess of $2.0 million and goods in excess of $200,000 will be subject to prior review&#13;
by the Bank/IDA. This will cover the ICB contract for the Changma Dam (para. 3.58)&#13;
and 17 NCB contracts for works ($54 million in value), and 15 contracts for goods ($14.4&#13;
million in value). The prior review of bid documents will cover 77 percent of all contract&#13;
value for civil works and more than 90 percent of contract value for goods. The slight&#13;
lower review coverage than the target 80 percent for works is due to large number of low&#13;
value packages of earthworks and small structures normally associated with irrigation&#13;
project. These small packages would be more efficiently carried out by small local&#13;
contractors at county and township levels. Beside supporting and promoting local&#13;
construction industry and participatory work by project stakeholders, the timely&#13;
completion of these small packages of works would bring project benefits on stream with&#13;
completion of each package of works. Standard Bidding Documents with standard&#13;
Special Conditions prepared and issued by the Ministry of Finance, in consultation with&#13;
the Bank/IDA, would be used for ICB and NCB. All other contracts will be subject to&#13;
selective review after bid awards. Annex B Table 2 shows procurement packaging and&#13;
scheduling of major items of works and goods by ICB and NCB contracts.&#13;
3.61  Technical Assistance and Training.  The selection and engagement of&#13;
consultants to carry out the technical assistance programs will be based on the Bank's&#13;
"Guidelines for Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency-August 1981." The World Bank's Standard Form of Contract for&#13;
Consultants' Services will be used and prior review of consultant service contracts by the&#13;
Bank/IDA would be required for contracts with an estimated cost of $100,000 or more for&#13;
firms and $50,000 or more for individuals. In addition, terms of reference and sole-&#13;
source selection of consultants, regardless of the value of the consultancy contract, are&#13;
subject to the Bank's prior review. All reimbursable training will be based on programs&#13;
agreed with the Bank/IDA.&#13;
N. DISBURSEMENT&#13;
3.62  The proceeds of the Bank Loan/IDA Credit would be disbursed as follows:&#13;
I5 Including prequalification, notice of invitation to bid, bid documents, bid evaluation and&#13;
recommendations, and contracts.&#13;

3.63   To  accelerate and facilitate construction  of the main  Changma Dam, and&#13;
involuntary resettlement of households affected by the Changma Reservoir, retroactive&#13;
financing of construction works effective from October 1, 1995 will be required for the&#13;
following: (a) construction of temporary works and facilities covering access roads,&#13;
electricity and communication to the dam site; (b) improvement and expansion of the&#13;
irrigation facilities in the Huahai Irrigation Area of the 5,580 mu resettlement site so that&#13;
relocation and resettlement of families affected by the Changma Reservoir can be carried&#13;
out early; and (c) construction of two branch canals, and a portion of Anxi North Main&#13;
Canal, to serve pilot settlement areas. The total disbursable amount would be SDR 3.43&#13;
million ($5.0 million equivalent) as detailed in the work programs in Annex B Table 4&#13;
reviewed and approved by the Bank/IDA.&#13;
3.64   Statements of Expenditures (SOEs) will be used for disbursements to be made&#13;
against (a) works under contracts costing less than $2,000,000 equivalent each (which&#13;
includes all force account works); (b) goods under contracts costing less than $200,000&#13;
equivalent each; (c) training and study tours; (d) consultants' services under contracts&#13;
awarded to firms costing less than $100,000 equivalent each and consultants' services&#13;
contracts awarded to individuals costing less than $50,000 equivalent each; and&#13;
(e) operating costs for design, supervision and management. SOEs for force account&#13;
works are to be supported by progress reports showing physical quantities and unit prices,&#13;
the latter to be reviewed and updated annually and agreed by the Bank/IDA.&#13;
3.65   To facilitate disbursement, a Special Account, to be operated by the existing&#13;
Gansu World Bank Projects Implementation Office (GPIO) under the Gansu Bureau of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
Finance, will be established in a bank acceptable to the Bank/IDA. The Special Account&#13;
will have an initial authorized allocation of $6 million equivalent, which will be increased&#13;
to $10 million when the cumulative disbursement amount reaches SDR 30 million. GPIO&#13;
will prepare and submit applications for disbursement and replenishment of the Special&#13;
Account monthly or whenever the account is drawn down to half its initial amount,&#13;
whichever comes first. The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2006 and to&#13;
close on December 31, 2006. The estimated schedule of disbursements is given in Annex&#13;
a Table 5. The disbursement schedule is slower than the historical profile for water&#13;
resources and agricultural projects in China, due to the nature of the project. It is closer&#13;
to that of land settlement projects in China and other competent borrowing countries.&#13;
0. ACCOUNTS AND AUDITS&#13;
3.66 The Shule River Basin Project Management Bureau (PMB) will maintain records&#13;
of all project expenditures. These records will be forwarded regularly to GPIO, which&#13;
will review and consolidate the accounts of expenditure and submit them to the&#13;
Bank/IDA for disbursement. GPIO has proposed that the State Audit Administration&#13;
through its Gansu Provincial Bureau of Audit will audit the project accounts; this&#13;
auditing arrangement is acceptable to the Bank/IDA. The audited accounts will also&#13;
include the Special Account and the details on withdrawals from the Loan/Credit account&#13;
made on the basis of SOEs, and the auditor's opinion as to whether such withdrawals&#13;
were made against expenditures eligible for disbursement by the Bank/IDA. At&#13;
negotiations, assurances were obtained from Gansu Province that it will maintain&#13;
consolidated project accounts, which will be audited by an independent auditor, and&#13;
submit such audited accounts to the Bank/lIDA within six months of the close of each&#13;
financial year.&#13;
&#13;

4. ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT&#13;
A. PROJECT ORGANIZATION&#13;
4.1   The Shule River Basin Project Management Bureau (PMB), established at Yumen&#13;
Township, will have overall responsibility for project implementation and management&#13;
under the guidance of the existing Gansu World Bank Projects Implementation&#13;
Commission (GWBPIC), and Gansu Bureau of Water Resources (GBWR) which has&#13;
been designated as the owner and principal agency to oversee the project implementation&#13;
and provide technical guidance. A Vice Governor in charge of agriculture has been&#13;
designated to oversee the Hexi Corridor Project. The existing Gansu World Bank&#13;
Projects Implementation Office (GPIO) in the Gansu Bureau of Finance, serving as an&#13;
executive arm of GWBPIC, will assume overall financial responsibility in project&#13;
funding, including applying for reimbursement of project expenditures from the&#13;
Bank/IDA. The general organization of the project is shown in Chart 1.&#13;
4.2   PMB, with status of a provincial bureau, will have eight departments: general&#13;
administration; finance; engineering and infrastructure; settlement and social services;&#13;
agroeconomic development; monitoring and evaluation; procurement and supplies, and a&#13;
representative office in Lanzhou. The total staff establishment is estimated at 100&#13;
persons. Three advisory or consultative bodies would also be established to advise PMB&#13;
on project implementation specifics. These bodies are:&#13;
(a)   Panel of Experts.  The panel would consist of senior experienced&#13;
technical experts, reputed institutions of higher learning, and research&#13;
centers, within Gansu Province or in the country, of various disciplines to&#13;
advise PMB on specific technical issues or problems as the needs arise.&#13;
PMB would maintain a list of panel experts and institutions updated&#13;
periodically.&#13;
(b)   Local Government Consultative Committee (LGCC).  Comprising&#13;
local government representatives from Jiuquan Prefecture, Yumen City&#13;
and Township, and Anxi County, LGCC will meet regularly with PMB for&#13;
consultation on project proposals for their respective constituents, exercise&#13;
the participatory role and provide the contribution required by and of the&#13;
constituent governments in project implementation. The LGCC will also&#13;
liaise closely with county/city project leading groups and project&#13;
management offices on the land settlement programs.&#13;
(c)   Settlement Advisory and Coordination Committee (SACC). The land&#13;
settlement of 54,600 ha newly irrigated land with 200,000 persons would&#13;
involve 11 emigrating counties from central and southeast Gansu and the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
hosts-Yumen City and Township, Anxi County and Jiuquan Prefecture.&#13;
To ensure a participatory role of the stakeholders in the successful&#13;
emigration and settlement, SACC, comprising representatives from&#13;
provincial bureaus of Civil Affairs, Ethnic Affairs, Poverty Alleviation&#13;
and State Farms, Lanzhou University, local governmnent representatives&#13;
from Jiuquan, Ganan, Dingxi, Linxia and Longnan prefectures, the 11&#13;
emigrating counties and the host Anxi County and Yumen City&#13;
governments in Hexi, will advise PMB and its Settlement and Social&#13;
Services Department on the detailed planning, design and program&#13;
implementation of the land settlement component. For impartiality, the&#13;
SACC would be chaired by a person nominated by Gansu Provincial&#13;
Government, and assisted by two vice chairmen, one representing the&#13;
emigrating county governments and the other the host governments in&#13;
Hexi. Each chairman of the 11 County Emigration and Settlement&#13;
Leading Groups (CESLG) will be a member of the SACC.&#13;
(d)   County Emigration and Settlement Leading Group (CESLG). Each of&#13;
the 11 emigrating counties would establish a CESLG chaired by the&#13;
county or deputy county chief with heads of the township emigration/&#13;
settlement groups as members. The CESLGs would: (i) plan and oversee&#13;
implementation of the emigration/settlement programs carried out by the&#13;
county Settlement Offices; (ii) approve settler households processed and&#13;
recommended by the Village Settlement Groups and township&#13;
governments; (iii) coordinate, through SACC, with PMB the annual&#13;
budgets and programs for emigration and settlement, and the follow-up on&#13;
the welfare of those emigrated and settled; and (iv) plan and oversee&#13;
rehabilitation and restoration of the environmentally degraded areas after&#13;
the people have emigrated.&#13;
(e)   Project Implementation Leading Groups (PILGs). At city, county and&#13;
state farm level, PILGs would be established to organize and oversee&#13;
implementation of project works and activities contracted with PMB. The&#13;
PILGs would liaise closely with LGCC and SACC on their needs in&#13;
formulating the annual plan and work programs to be prepared by PMB.&#13;
The PILGs would be assisted by respective project management offices to&#13;
be established.&#13;
4.3   The PMB, Panel of Experts, LGCC, SACC, CESLGs and PILGs were established&#13;
prior to project negotiations. During negotiations, assurances were obtained from&#13;
Gansu Province that these entities would be maintained with terms of reference, staffing&#13;
and other resources acceptable to the Bank/IDA.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
B. FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.4   Flow of Bank/IDA Funds. Assurances were obtained at negotiations that the&#13;
Borrower would make the proceeds of the Bank Loan and IDA Credit available to Gansu&#13;
Province for 20 years including 5 years' grace for the Loan and 7 years for the Credit&#13;
with interest at the same rates charged by the BanklIDA for the Loan and the Credit.&#13;
Gansu Provincial Government has designated Gansu Provincial Bureau of Water&#13;
Resources (GBWR) as the "owner" of the project to be responsible for the cost recovery,&#13;
repayment of Bank loan and credit, and the foreign exchange risk. Part of the Bank/IDA&#13;
funds will be paid directly to contractors for civil works and suppliers of goods under&#13;
ICB contracts on request by GPIO. A small portion of funds will be used to cover the&#13;
costs of training and technical assistance. The remaining funds will be disbursed against&#13;
local expenditures for civil works, on-farm works, land reclamation and settlement,&#13;
livestock, afforestation and goods procured locally through NCB, force account works&#13;
and shopping.&#13;
4.5   Sources and Flow of Domestic Funds. Domestic funds, which will finance&#13;
about 42 percent of the project costs, will be contributed by various sources as&#13;
sunmmarized in Annex B Table 11. Project beneficiaries will also contribute both self-&#13;
raised funds and labor for earthwork construction. Understandings were obtained from&#13;
the Borrower and Gansu Province that these sources of domestic funds are firm and&#13;
committed.&#13;
4.6   Terms and Conditions of Bank Loan/IDA Credit. A Project Agreement will be&#13;
signed between the Bank/IDA and Gansu Province incorporating the above agreements.&#13;
C. EXECUTION AND SUPERVISION OF PROJECT WORKS&#13;
4.7   Execution. Planning, designs and execution of major civil works contracts on&#13;
Changma Dam, New Trunk Canal and the main canal extension and improvements in the&#13;
three irrigation areas will be undertaken by Gansu Bureau of Water Resources (GBWR)&#13;
through a full-time unit responsible to PMB. Other civil works including on-farm&#13;
facilities will be executed by Yumen Township Water Conservancy Department&#13;
(YTWCD) coordinated by this unit.  Similarly, crop production, livestock and&#13;
afforestation will be executed by the provincial/prefecture/county technical bureaus and&#13;
departments concerned and coordinated by project units under PMB. The land settlement&#13;
will be executed by the respective existing county settlement offices in the I I emigrating&#13;
counties, Anxi County and Yumen City, and coordinated by the Settlement and Social&#13;
Services Division (SSSD) under PMB.&#13;
4.8   Supervision. Day-to-day supervision of project works will be accomplished by&#13;
implementing departments.  For Changma Dam, GBWR will engage consultants&#13;
acceptable to the Bank/IDA to assist GBWR in the supervision of civil works&#13;
construction under ICB contract. To supplement the Bank/IDA supervision, PMB will,&#13;
from time to time, engage local experts from the Panel of Experts to supervise the&#13;
progress of various project components.  PMB  will furnish the findings and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
recommendations of these experts to the Bank/IDA. The respective provincial technical&#13;
bureaus/departments will undertake supervision of works based on annual work programs&#13;
planned and agreed by PMB. SSSD, in collaboration with CESLGs, will supervise the&#13;
annual emigration and settlement programs to be executed by the county settlement&#13;
offices.&#13;
D. PROJECT LAUNCH WORKSHOP&#13;
4.9   To facilitate project implementation, the Bank/IDA in collaboration with the&#13;
Ministry of Finance will conduct a project launch workshop in Lanzhou in May 1996 for&#13;
the staff of GPIO, PMB and project county/city implementing agencies. The objectives&#13;
of the workshop will be to clarify the role and responsibilities of PMB and its various&#13;
departments, and entities of local governments in project implementation. Other topics to&#13;
be included will be: (a) procurement (based on the new guidelines of January 1995) and&#13;
disbursement; (b) project accounts and annual auditing; (c) monitoring and evaluation;&#13;
and (d) recordkeeping and reporting.  Experienced staff from other Bank-financed&#13;
projects would be invited to the workshop to share their experience.&#13;
E. EMIGRATION AND LAND SETTLEMENT MANAGEMENT&#13;
4.10  Effective and efficient management will be needed to ensure successful&#13;
emigration and settlement of the planned 200,000 people. PMB, in consultation with&#13;
SACC, CESLG and LGCC, will plan detailed annual emigration and settlement programs&#13;
based on the approved Land Settlement Master Plan for approval by GWBPIC. The&#13;
approved programs will then be suballocated to the respective emigrating counties for&#13;
execution by the county settlement offices. PMB, through its SSSD and the Monitoring&#13;
and Evaluation Division, will supervise and monitor the implementation progress. For&#13;
implementation coordination between the 11 emigrating counties and the host county/city&#13;
of Anxi and Yumen, PMB will resolve any issues jointly through meetings held at regular&#13;
intervals with SACC, CESLG and LGCC. To strengthen SSSD under PMB, some&#13;
experienced staff from the Two Xi Commission will be seconded to SSSD to form its&#13;
core staff. The overall organizational and management structure for emigration and land&#13;
settlement is shown in Chart 2.&#13;
F. OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF PROJECT WORKS&#13;
4.11  A new Shule River Basin Water Resources Management Bureau (SRWRMB) will&#13;
be established at Yumen Township not later than December 31, 1998 to be responsible&#13;
for the overall basinwide water resource planning, development, operation and&#13;
management in the Shule River Basin. SRWRMB will be established by Gansu&#13;
Provincial Government and given appropriate regulatory power under the Water Laws.&#13;
This is to ensure efficient water control and dispatch of the main and secondary irrigation&#13;
systems transcending county administrative boundaries. The existing three operation and&#13;
maintenance (O&amp;M) offices, the Anxi County Water Conservancy Office operating and&#13;
maintaining the Shuangta Irrigation Area, the Yumen City Office for the Huahai&#13;
Irrigation Area, and the Shule River Irrigation Management Office operating the trunk&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
canals and the Changma Irrigation Area, will be consolidated and placed under&#13;
SRWRMB. The proposed new organizational structure for operation and maintenance is&#13;
shown in Chart 3. SRWRMB will prepare a plan for the overall O&amp;M of the completed&#13;
irrigation works covering the three irrigation areas and submit the plan to the Bank/IDA&#13;
for review not later than December 31, 1999, and carry out O&amp;M of the irrigation works&#13;
based on the operation and maintenance plan reviewed and agreed by the Bank/IDA.&#13;
4.12  To provide an effective means for efficient irrigation water control, dispatch and&#13;
management, a monitoring system will be constructed with a network of telemetricJ&#13;
communication stations covering the whole irrigation area to collect and transmit data to&#13;
the center in SRWRMB for computerized simulation (or optimization) of control and&#13;
distribution of irrigation water. This monitoring system would play a major role in&#13;
assisting management in deriving decision rules for operation of the irrigation system and&#13;
for drought crisis management. Details of the system are summarized in Annex G.&#13;
4.13  To sustain the required operation and maintenance of irrigation works, annual&#13;
water fees will be collected from the users in the project area. Current irrigation water&#13;
rates range from Y 0.015 to Y 0.03 per m3. Based on the projected production cost per&#13;
unit of water, these rates would be revised after 1999, taking into consideration the&#13;
inflationary increase in cost, and to be imposed upon completion of irrigation facilities in&#13;
each main canal command area. The revenue collected is expected to cover at least the&#13;
full annual operation and maintenance costs, but not the depreciation costs.&#13;
4.14  At negotiations, assurances were obtainedfrom Gansu Province that SRWPMB&#13;
will (a) be established not later than December 31, 1998 with terms of reference, staffing&#13;
and other resources acceptable to the Bank/IDA; (b) prepare and submit to the Bank/IDA&#13;
a plan for operation and maintenance of the whole irrigation area for review not later&#13;
than December 31, 1999 and carry out the required annual operation and maintenance&#13;
for the completed irrigation works, taking into account the Bank's/IDA's comments;&#13;
(c) collect irrigation water rates upon completion of irrigation facilities in each main&#13;
canal command area at levels adequate to meet at least the full annual operation and&#13;
maintenance costs of completed irrigation works and the cost of replacing their&#13;
structures; and (d) furnish to the Bank./IDA not later than December 31, 1999, the&#13;
proposed schedule of such water rates to be established and collected.&#13;
G. MANAGEMENT OF PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES&#13;
4.15  Technical supervision of livestock, forestry and agroforestry production would be&#13;
provided by supervising units or groups to be established within the bureaus concerned at&#13;
county and township levels under the guidance of prefecture and provincial departrnents.&#13;
PMB would oversee and monitor the progress and performance of the agreed annual&#13;
programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
H. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REPORTING&#13;
4.16 The monitoring of project performance and impact has been discussed with Gansu&#13;
Province. A Monitoring and Evaluation Division (MED) will be established under PMB&#13;
to coordinate the monitoring and evaluation of the project's progress, performance and&#13;
impacts of various subcomponents to be carried out by assigned technical departments.&#13;
There will be three subprograms for monitoring and evaluation (see below) by assigned&#13;
technical departments. In addition, MED will undertake the overall monitoring of&#13;
physical and financial progress of project implementation and prepare consolidated&#13;
reports for submission to project management and the Bank. Project staff in MED would&#13;
be trained on the collection of data, their analysis and evaluation, and reporting.&#13;
(a)   Involuntary Resettlement for Changma Reservoir:  The National&#13;
Research Center for Resettlement (NRCR) of Hehai University in&#13;
Nanjing, in collaboration with Gansu Design Institute, will monitor and&#13;
evaluate annually the socioeconomic well-being of 131 families (566&#13;
persons) relocated by the construction of the Changma Reservoir and&#13;
resettled in the Huahai Irrigation Area. The monitoring and evaluation&#13;
would be initially for four to five years or until the relocatees have&#13;
achieved at least current livelihood levels. MED will coordinate with&#13;
NRCR for the timely monitoring and dissemination of findings, which will&#13;
be forwarded directly to the Bank, and recommendations for any follow-&#13;
up action required by the project management.&#13;
(b)   Voluntary Emigration and Land Settlement: Over a 10-year period of&#13;
settlement implementation, the Population Research Institute of Northwest&#13;
China, Lanzhou University will undertake the monitoring and evaluation&#13;
of the new migrants settled in the project area. An aggregate of 10 percent&#13;
of the migrant households will be surveyed each year. Results will be&#13;
forwarded directly to MED and the Bank. More details of the monitoring&#13;
parameters and targets are given in Annex F. The monitoring and&#13;
evaluation would not only establish a comprehensive database of the&#13;
migrant settlers and provide valuable information on socioeconomic&#13;
impacts, but also identify any specific deficiencies in the settlement&#13;
programs affecting the settlers.   This would enable the project&#13;
management to take timely remedial actions or to design improvements to&#13;
the programs for the coming years.&#13;
(c)   Environmental Monitoring of Land &amp; Water Resources: A long-term&#13;
basinwide eco-environmental monitoring will be carried out by existing&#13;
county, city and prefecture environmental protection agencies in the Hexi&#13;
Corridor, supported by local specialist consultants, to evaluate the long-&#13;
term impacts on land and water resources, and the ecosystem, resulting&#13;
from implementation of the project. Details of the monitoring are given in&#13;
Annex D on the Environmental Action Plan.  The project would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
strengthen and support the institutional capacity and capability of various&#13;
local environmental units to carry out the monitoring and analytical work.&#13;
(d)   Physical and Financial Progress of Project Implementation: MED will&#13;
collate progress reports from the respective technical bureaus and units&#13;
implementing the project components to compile into the overall physical&#13;
and financial progress report for the project. Physical reports will include&#13;
quantities of work completed, as well as machinery, equipment and&#13;
materials procured and used. Financial reports will detail all project&#13;
expenditures, amount and value of contributed labor, and supporting&#13;
documents for disbursement from Loan/Credit proceeds. MED will&#13;
compile the progress report semiannually for review by PMB and&#13;
subsequent submission to the Bank through GPIO by July 31 and January&#13;
31 of each year, for the previous half-year periods.&#13;
4.17  The monitoring of performance indicators and impacts for the above four&#13;
monitoring programs are given in Annex H. At negotiations, assurances were obtained&#13;
from Gansu Province that it would: (a) carry out periodic monitoring of project&#13;
performance and impacts based on indicators discussed, and furnish the results to the&#13;
Bank/IDA at agreed intervals; and (b) prepare andfurnish to the Bank/IDA semiannual&#13;
reports of the project's physical and financial progress by July 31 and January 31 of&#13;
each year, for the previous half-year periods.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

5. PRODUCTION, MARKETS AND PRICES&#13;
A. PRODUCTION&#13;
5.1   Crop production is expected to increase significantly by the time the project&#13;
reaches its full development year (beginning Year 18) due to improved and expanded&#13;
irrigation and drainage facilities, increase in irrigated area and improved agricultural&#13;
support services. The incremental cropped areas and production of various crops are&#13;
given in Annex C Table 3(a) to 3(d).&#13;
5.2   The total grain production is projected to increase from 111,040 tons (without&#13;
project) to 315,480 tons (with project) with an increment of 204,440 tons or 184 percent&#13;
of the without-project scenario. Major increases in commodity crop production projected&#13;
include: 6,875 tons cotton, 8,220 tons oil crops, 46,800 tons sugarbeet, 2,635 tons black&#13;
melon seed, 42,100 tons melons, 34,230 tons various vegetables, and 1,010 tons hops.&#13;
The total incremental production value is estimated at Y 584 million; Y 313 million for&#13;
grain crops and Y 271 million for commodity crops. The increased production of various&#13;
crops would also provide substantial increase in crop residues and forage (Y 72 million in&#13;
value), which would be used as coarse feed for livestock production.&#13;
5.3   The main incremental annual livestock products projected at full development&#13;
(beginning Year 22) are: 40 tons alfalfa seed, 126,650 tons alfalfa hay, 820,680 broiler/&#13;
layer chicken, 1,010 tons commercial egg, 676,000 egg for hatching layer chicks, 2.1 tons&#13;
wool, and seed stock of 32,600 chicks, 124 calves, 686 sheep, 3,010 breeding pigs and&#13;
20,100 piglets. The total output value is estimated at about Y 59.3 million.&#13;
5.4   The forestry and agroforestry component would produce annually about 14,440&#13;
tons of fuelwood during Year 1-10, 16,220 tons (commencing about year 15) and 24,780&#13;
tons at full development (Year 26), 2 million saplings for nursery, 71,230 poplar poles,&#13;
25,000 m3 of timber (commencing about Year 20) and about 62,670 tons of fruits&#13;
(commencing about Year 10), with a total value of Y 99.6 million against current output&#13;
value of about Y 3.0 million.&#13;
B. MARKETS&#13;
5.5   As Gansu Province is deficit in grain production, the increased grain production&#13;
will be absorbed by local markets within the province to offset about three fifths of the&#13;
projected foodgrain deficit. Currently, China produces only about 4.0 million tons of&#13;
cotton to meet her demand of about 5.0 million tons, and Gansu produces 18,000 tons&#13;
against demand of 23,000 tons. The increased production of 6,875 tons cotton under the&#13;
project would be completely procured by the State. The increased production of 46,800&#13;
tons of sugarbeet would be processed by the surplus processing capacity within the&#13;
province to meet national and provincial shortages of sugar, currently estimated at about&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
700,000 tons. Hops (particularly in pelletized form) is in big demand by overseas and&#13;
local beer breweries. The increased production of hops will be readily absorbed by the&#13;
local and national markets. The increased production of livestock and forestry products&#13;
would be absorbed mainly by local markets in the project area and within the province.&#13;
5.6   The existing marketing channels operated by the national commerce departments,&#13;
supply and marketing cooperatives, supplemented by cooperatives, household groups and&#13;
individual traders, offer very competitive markets for agricultural produce. Farmers&#13;
would be able to obtain market prices, and this would provide incentives for increased&#13;
production. The future market in the project area is expected to expand with the&#13;
improvement of the transportation network, especially the National Highway No. 312 and&#13;
the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Dual-track Railway passing through the project area.&#13;
C. PRICES&#13;
5.7    At present the prices of agricultural products in the project area, except for cotton&#13;
and tobacco, are free-market prices or coexist with a free-market price.  State&#13;
procurement prices consist of a ceiling and floor guaranteed price. In general, all direct&#13;
government subsidies have been eliminated.&#13;
5.8   In Hexi Corridor output prices have risen steadily for the past several years. From&#13;
1985 to 1993, the crop purchasing price index rose 73, 74, 82 and 117 percent for grain,&#13;
oil, cotton, and vegetables, respectively. From 1993 to 1994 the official guaranteed price&#13;
rose about 25 percent for grain (Y0.8/kg to Y 1/kg), and 21.1 percent for cotton&#13;
(Y 6.6/kg to Y 8/kg). The unit prices of vegetables, fruits, and meats also increased.&#13;
Recent increases brought the official grain price close to the local open-market price, and&#13;
also close to world prices adjusted to the farm level. Local market prices in 1995 have&#13;
been increased about 23 percent for wheat (Y 1.3/kg to Y 1.6/kg), 50 percent for cotton&#13;
(Y 8/kg to Y 12/kg), 30 percent for melon seed, and 30 percent for beets from 1994.&#13;
Prices are expected to continue rising due to the higher incomes and demand in the&#13;
project area and surrounding industrial and urban growth centers.&#13;
5.9   Presently, farrners procure inputs at market prices. These prices are about 15-25&#13;
percent higher than the formerly subsidized prices. From 1993 to 1994 the price rose&#13;
about 29 percent for urea, 14 percent for phosphate fertilizer, and 30 percent for&#13;
agricultural chemicals. In 1995 the price for nitrogen fertilizer increased by about 29&#13;
percent from 1994 in the project area.&#13;
5.10  Prices Used in Analysis. Input and output prices used in the crop budgets for&#13;
financial analysis of the project components are either 1995 average free-market prices or&#13;
official prices, and are based on data provided by the project authorities. These prices are&#13;
summarized in Annex C Table 1. For economic analysis, World Bank commodity price&#13;
projections have been used to calculate the farm-gate value of wheat, maize, soybean,&#13;
cotton, chicken, pork, and urea, with appropriate adjustments for domestic and&#13;
international transport and handling costs. The economic value of most other farm inputs&#13;
and outputs was considered either equivalent to the financial price or adjusted by the&#13;
standard conversion factor. Detailed calculations are shown in Annex C Table 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
6. BENEFITS, JUSTIFICATION AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
6.1   The most important of all benefits is the alleviation of absolute poverty of&#13;
200,000 poor farmers from subsistence farming to self-sufficiency in food and basic&#13;
needs, and then ultimately to become moderate- to high-income farmers. The migrant&#13;
households would also enjoy better standards of living and higher quality of life in the&#13;
new settlements.'6&#13;
6.2   The increased production of foodgrain, commodity crops and livestock products&#13;
(Annex&amp;..  Table 3a-3e) will ease current shortages in the Province, especially of&#13;
foodgrain, import of which will be reduced by three-fifths. With emigration and&#13;
settlement on the newly irrigated land, the 200,000 poor farmers would be self-sufficient&#13;
in food and basic needs, and no longer dependent on government relief. With the out-&#13;
migration there would be reduction of population pressure on marginal land in source&#13;
areas and this would facilitate more rational use of natural resources and higher&#13;
productivity per capita. The other significant intangible benefit is the protection and&#13;
enhancement of the fragile eco-environmental system of the projec, area through the&#13;
planned afforestation and rational use of land and water resources.&#13;
6.3   The project would generate a total of about 112.3 GWh/year hydroelectric power,&#13;
which would be fed into the local grid to alleviate the current power shortages. The&#13;
Changma Reservoir would increase the industrial water supply to 83 Mm3/year. The&#13;
project would also stimulate and promote economic growth in the two project counties&#13;
through creation of 16 new townships and 160 villages to accommodate the 200,000&#13;
migrant population. The projected agricultural production, including that of livestock and&#13;
forestry, would turn the project area into a major grain and commodity crops production&#13;
base in the province, providing the essential raw materials for township and village&#13;
enterprises, and generating employment opportunities in the service sector as well.&#13;
B. EMPLOYMENT AND INCOMES&#13;
6.4   Employment. During project implementation, some 29.6 million worker-days&#13;
would be required for the construction of Changma Dam and the irrigation systems; 17.5&#13;
million for land settlement; 1.7 million for agricultural development; and 3.0 million for&#13;
other activities. The required labor would be provided mainly by the new migrant settlers&#13;
16 While all costs of migration and settlement have been included in rate of return calculations of the&#13;
project, no benefits of improved housing and social services for settlers have been quantified.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
and the local population, and the rest from other neighboring counties and within the&#13;
province. Some skilled workers will be provided by construction contractors from&#13;
outside the province. After the project is completed, some 14 million worker-days of&#13;
regular employment would be created; 12 million in crop production and agricultural&#13;
support services; 0.7 million in livestock production; 1.0 million in forestry and&#13;
agroforestry; 0.3 million in operation and maintenance of irrigation and power systems.&#13;
Numerous undetermined jobs would also be created by rural, township and village&#13;
enterprises in the new 16 townships and 160 villages to be created by land settlement.&#13;
6.5   Incomes. Per capita incomes of the majority of the households from the 11&#13;
emigrating counties are currently below the poverty line (Y 400 per capita income),&#13;
varying from Y 188 to Y 365 (see Annex F Table 2) with an overall average of Y 290 for&#13;
the 11 counties, below the absolute poverty level of Y 300. The farm model analysis&#13;
shows substantial increase in migrants' income with the comprehensive improvement in&#13;
irrigation and drainage, crop, livestock and forestry production, and agricultural support&#13;
and agrimachinery service. Several items have been considered to calculate and assess&#13;
the impacts on typical household income, such as various incremental taxes (agricultural&#13;
tax, special product tax and fee, etc.); the project loan repayment (including farmer labor&#13;
contribution requirement allocated to each household); and an incremental water charge&#13;
that will cover the full operation and maintenance costs for the new and rehabilitated&#13;
irrigation and drainage system. Charges for additional (1.5 to 2 mu per capita) leased&#13;
cultivated land will be waived for the first three years. It will be charged at Y 50/mu in&#13;
the fourth through sixth years and Y 100/mu following the seventh year after&#13;
immigration. The standard charge for these items is presented in the typical household&#13;
farm model (see Annex C Table 4).&#13;
6.6    Many farm households were surveyed in the project area to represent typical&#13;
beneficiary families. The representative farm households were selected in three irrigation&#13;
areas based on specialized livestock production, and crop production technologies with&#13;
different cropping area. Three counties were selected among the 11 emigrating counties&#13;
to derive detailed income and expenditure data in the model: Jishishan, representing a&#13;
minority area, cold climate, high altitude, and a relatively high income; Lixian, also&#13;
representing a cold climate and high altitude but with mid-level income for this poverty&#13;
area; and Yongjin, representing an arid, centrally located, relatively poor area. The net&#13;
incomes of migrant households who adopted improved or new technologies under the&#13;
project would increase substantially. The farm models indicate that the project would&#13;
increase farm household income from Y 729-1,382 currently to Y 4,884-4,897 in year 10&#13;
in Changma, Y 1,600 to Y 6,500 in Shuangta, and Y 12,000 to Y 15,900 in Huahai."7 In&#13;
addition, migrant household income with specialized livestock production will increase&#13;
from Y 1,357 to Y 8,144 with cattle production, and Y 12,592 with sheep production&#13;
17 The higher incomes referred to relocatees from Changma village to Huahai new irrigation area affected&#13;
by the construction of the Changma Reservoir. Their present incomes are comparatively high due to&#13;
incomes derived from rearing of large herds of livestock.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

6.7    The summary table of migrant household net incomes in each subproject area is&#13;
presented in Annex C Table 5.   It shows the annual average real growth rate of&#13;
household income at 3 to 25 percent through year 10, and 3.3 to 14 percent through year&#13;
20 for various forms of specialized production.&#13;
C. COST RECOVERY AND REPAYMENT&#13;
6.8    Cost recovery for the project will take several forms. Farners will pay the full&#13;
cost of some agricultural inputs and services, i.e., seeds, tree saplings, livestock,"8&#13;
agricultural machinery services. The investment cost in irrigation will be recovered&#13;
through labor contributions for construction, operation and maintenance, and through&#13;
increases in irrigation water charges (para. 4.13) to meet at least the full annual O&amp;M&#13;
costs.&#13;
6.9    The Gansu Government proposes to recover some capital costs from the migrant&#13;
settlers through rent for lease of an additional 1.5 to 2 mu per capita of newly developed&#13;
irrigated land (para. 3.27). The rent amount is estimated at Y 1.5 billion for 370,000 mu&#13;
over a 20-year period. The net increase in agricultural taxes'9 (comprising normal&#13;
agricultural tax plus 8 percent tax of local product value) at full development is projected&#13;
to be about Y 23.65 million/year. Part of this additional revenue (60 percent) will be&#13;
used for project repayment. The estimated Y 60/year/person saving by provincial&#13;
government on reduction of poverty interventions and providing grain and other social&#13;
relief to 200,000 people as a result of emigration and settlement would amount to about&#13;
Y 120 million over a 10-year period. This amount would also be used for loan/credit&#13;
repayment.&#13;
D. FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC ANALYSES&#13;
Financial Analysis&#13;
6.10   Financial analyses for the principal components were based on detailed crop&#13;
budgets prepared for the annual and perennial crops, reflecting representative scenarios in&#13;
each component and subproject. Selected crop budgets for wheat, corn and cotton are&#13;
given in Annex C Table 6a to 6e. Given the price and cost structures in each subproject&#13;
area, as well as the objective of the project, rates of return for all components are&#13;
acceptable. The FIRRs on individual components ranged from 12.1 (Changma Irrigation&#13;

(a) Epidemic Prevention: Sheep/goat Y 1.50/head, pig Y 1.0/head, chicken Y 0.10/bird;&#13;
(b) Diagnosis/Treatment: Large animal Y 1.50/head, Small animal Y 1.0/head;&#13;
(c) Castration: Horse Y 20/head; Cattle Y 15/head; Sow/Boar Y 1.5-Y 1.0/head; Sheep/Goat Y 1.0/head;&#13;

Area) to 26.2 percent (Parent Layer Chicks Farm). The overall irrigation/drainage&#13;
component FIRR is 15.6; ranging from 12.1 in Changma to 17.2 in Shuangta and to 12.3&#13;
percent in Huahai.&#13;
6.11  The FIRR on forestry components ranged from 12.5 to 21 percent, depending on&#13;
the kind of trees. The fuelwood forest is 13.3 percent, nursery 16.6 percent, and orchard&#13;
21 percent, while the lowest rate, 12.5 percent, occurs for planting of protection forestry.&#13;
The latter does not always pay in the short run, although it is a critical element in the&#13;
comprehensive protection and conservation of the ecosystem.&#13;
6.12  The FIRR for the grassland and livestock subproject is 19.6 percent, 18.7 percent&#13;
is for pasture improvement, 17.9 percent for forage seed production base, 24.4 percent for&#13;
the livestock production base, 12.5 to 16.2 percent for lean pork and sow breeding farms,&#13;
and 26.2 to 14.3 percent for poultry (layer/broiler) breeding farms. The detailed tables&#13;
showing financial rates of return are attached in Annex C Table 7a and 7b.&#13;
Assumptions for Economic Analysis&#13;
6.13  Economic analysis was done on the major components (irrigation and drainage,&#13;
forestry, grassland and livestock) and for the project as a whole. World Bank price&#13;
projections or export prices actually realized in China were used to estimate farm-gate&#13;
prices in 1995 constant terms for traded inputs and outputs. The standard conversion&#13;
factor of I was applied to all nontraded items. Conversion factors for investment cost&#13;
items are listed in Annex C Table 8. All economic values were converted to local&#13;
currency at the prevailing official exchange rate of Y 8.4 to $1.0, and a discount rate of&#13;
12 percent was used to approximate the opportunity cost of capital in China. All project&#13;
costs, including project investment and production costs, working capital and physical&#13;
contingencies, have been considered in estimating the economic costs of the project, but&#13;
price contingencies, interest, and taxes were omitted.&#13;
Economic and Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
6.14  Based on the above assumptions and comparing costs and benefits over a period&#13;
of 30 years, the economic internal rates of return (EIRRs) for selected components range&#13;
between 18.2 percent (for irrigation and drainage component) to 29.1 percent (for&#13;
livestock development component), depending on the assumed cropping and activity&#13;
pattern, the size of the irrigation and planted area, and the investment cost.  The&#13;
estimation of economic costs and benefits of the project accounted for  project&#13;
investment, migrants' subsidies, farm production cost, and all incremental migrant&#13;
household income from crop, forestry, and livestock production. The overall project&#13;
EIRR is 18.8 percent with a net present value of about Y 774.1 million (Annex C&#13;
Table 9). The results of the economic analysis are summarized in Table 6.1. If the&#13;
assumed crop yields take 10 years (instead of 7 years) to reach stable stage, the overall&#13;
EIRR will be reduced to 17.1 percent with a net present value of Y 587.4 million (see&#13;
Table 6.2).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
6.15  Sensitivity analysis of the ERRs for each of the project components was carried&#13;
out with switching values to identify levels at which the project would become&#13;
economically nonviable, and how far the total costs including the operation input cost and&#13;
investment cost could rise or benefits (the yield or output price) could fall. Table 6.1&#13;
shows that the overall project is not rendered unprofitable by significant changes in cost&#13;
or benefits. Benefits will need to be 26 percent lower than estimated or incremental&#13;
costs 34 percent higher before the EIRR will fall to 12 percent. The detailed&#13;
sensitivity analyses can be found in the project files.&#13;
E. RIsKS&#13;
6.16  The project risks have been identified and analyzed. Measures have also been&#13;
incorporated in the project to minimize their effect. The major risks associated with the&#13;
project are:&#13;
(a)   potential increased salinity in the Shuangta Reservoir water due to&#13;
leaching and drainage from accelerating upstream reclamation of salinized&#13;
land;&#13;
(b)   natural disasters of drought, scorching heat waves and sand storms;&#13;
(c)   delay in achieving the stable crop yields assumed at the eighth year for&#13;
reclaimed land;&#13;
(d)   reduced benefits from lower canal system efficiency; and&#13;
(e)   delay of project implementation due to slow and poor performance of land&#13;
settlement, and lack of inadequate institutional and financial support.&#13;
These risks were evaluated with sensitivity analyses on a variety of data and assumptions&#13;
required for the estimation of EIRR. The results shows that, even with consideration of&#13;
the risks mentioned above, the estimated EIRRs are higher than the assumed minimum&#13;
rate (12 percent). Further, measures have been taken to reduce these risks. Table 10&#13;
(AnnexC) summarizes the sensitivity analysis for the risks that were quantified.&#13;

6.17    Increased  Salinity in Shuangta Reservoir.  There is a potential increase in&#13;
salinity in the Shuangta Reservoir water due to planned upstream reclamation of salinized&#13;
soils drained by the stretch of the Shule River from Qiduntang to Bulunji of Changma&#13;
Irrigation  District.   The water quality, as defined  by  mineral content, deteriorates&#13;
somewhat after leaving the Shuangta Reservoir. A forecast of water quality, based on a&#13;
linear mixing basic model with a water balance regulation calculation, shows that the&#13;
mineralization level of Shuangta Reservoir can meet acceptable standards for farm&#13;
irrigation water (less than 2 grams/liter) only if the period of land reclamation is more&#13;
than 10 years (8-, 10- and 12-year periods were considered). If the period of land&#13;
reclamation is less than 10 years, the water quality will have some impact on crop yield,&#13;
mainly affecting wheat, barley, beans, and vegetables during July-August irrigation.&#13;
Local experimental data shows that crop yields will be reduced by about 5 percent on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
average. The risk from high mineralization (over 2 grams minerals/liter) has been&#13;
estimated to reduce crop yields by 5 percent (for crops mentioned above) in Shuangta&#13;
Area for a 10-year reclamation period in Changma Irrigation Area. The analysis shows&#13;
that the EIRR for the Shuangta component would fall from 23.4 in the base model to 18.1&#13;
should this actually occur. However, the PMO has proposed the following measures to&#13;
ensure Shuangta Reservoir will conform to the irrigation water quality standard:&#13;
(a)   adopt a phased 10-year plan (1996-2005) for land reclamation and salt&#13;
leaching;&#13;
(b)   timing of land reclamation and salt leaching with high stage flow of Shule&#13;
River;&#13;
(c)   closely monitor the mineral content of leaching water flowing into and out&#13;
of the reservoir, and adjust land reclamation accordingly.&#13;
6.18  Natural Disasters. According to the water balance calculation over the 41 years&#13;
of available hydrologic data (1952-93), and local meteorological statistics from the&#13;
agricultural department of Yumen and Anxi, there is a drought (P=75%) every four to&#13;
five years, and localized scorching heat waves or damaging sand storms about once in&#13;
five to six years. During the drought years, the area (about 60,000 ha) may face water&#13;
deficit (annual average about 73.6 million mi3) between April and June. This would&#13;
reduce mainly yields of wheat and barley by 5 to 10 percent through reduced irrigation&#13;
water supplied. Impact on other crops will be minimum. The scorching heat waves&#13;
would also mainly reduce crop yield of wheat and barley by about 5 to 10 percent in&#13;
average, although the effect on barley is somewhat less. Reduced yields of 8 and 7&#13;
percent for wheat and barley once every four years for drought, and every five years for&#13;
heat waves have been adopted in the risk analyses over the 30-year life span for the&#13;
project. This reduces the EIRR of the irrigation and drainage component from 18.2&#13;
percent of the base model to 17.2 percent, and net present value from Y 619.7 million to&#13;
Y 525 million. The measures adopted to minimize the risks would include:&#13;
(a)   establishing primary protecting forestry belts at the fringes of irrigation&#13;
districts and on-farm shelter belts and windbreaks;&#13;
(b)   promoting and extending water-saving irrigation technology;&#13;
(c)   conjunctive use of available groundwater with surface water, and&#13;
(d)   using computerized optimization modeling techniques provided for the&#13;
irrigation system for drought crisis management.&#13;
6.19  Stable Yields Delayed. There is also a risk that crop yields assumed in the base&#13;
model would not be stabilized within eight years of land reclamation and cultivation.&#13;
Delay might arise due to lack of experience of new migrant farmers with irrigated&#13;
agriculture, slow improvement of land reclaimed and soil amelioration, compounded by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
the harsh natural elements. The EIRR is recalculated for this risk by assuming a&#13;
conservative crop yield, which increases gradually in the first 3 years, and reaches the&#13;
stable path after 11 years based on the yield decrease of 5 to 20 percent for different crops&#13;
in the stable year. This reduces the EIRR of the irrigation and drainage component from&#13;
18.2 percent to 16.3 percent.&#13;
6.20  Reduced Benefits from Lower Canal System Efficiency. With the irrigation&#13;
improvement and new construction the overall canal system efficiency would increase&#13;
from 50 percent to 62 percent, which is the designed efficiency used in determining the&#13;
irrigation supply and demand under the project. Given the importance of land settlement&#13;
in this project, the efficiency is a key factor in determining the amount of new land that&#13;
can be developed for irrigation and, therefore, the number of settlers. Since canal system&#13;
efficiency is influenced by the size of the irrigation scheme, topography and soil&#13;
conditions, extent of canal lining, quality of construction, and standard of operation and&#13;
maintenance, the risk of not achieving the designed 62 percent efficiency exist. Risk and&#13;
sensitivity analyses have been conducted for a range of lower efficiency values (55&#13;
percent and 60 percent) evaluated against the projected benefits and the actual efficiency&#13;
achieved and monitored. The EIRR was recalculated by assuming a set of lower&#13;
irrigation efficiency value (55 percent and 60 percent), which would reduce irrigation&#13;
water supply by 121.8 and 31.9 Mm3, respectively. An optimal cropping pattern (based&#13;
on 55 percent efficiency), which jointly optimized irrigation and settlement benefits (to&#13;
minimize the benefits lost in agricultural production while ensuring self-sufficiency for&#13;
the 200,000 settlers), would retain the irrigation area for all single-cropped areas (grain,&#13;
fruit and cash crops), and reduce the irrigation area for pasture (from 11,060 ha to&#13;
4,000 ha) and some multiple cropping areas. This would reduce the EIRR of the&#13;
livestock component from 29 percent of the base model to 13.6 percent, and net present&#13;
value from about Y 58 million to Y 5 million. For the whole project, the results are less&#13;
sensitive to the reduced canal system efficiency. At 55 percent canal efficiency, the&#13;
EIRR would fall from 18.8 percent to 18.3 percent, and the net present value from Y 774&#13;
million to Y 721 million. Impact of 60 percent canal efficiency would be even less.&#13;
However, the risk of reduced efficiency would be minimized through the extensive&#13;
construction of canal linings throughout the canal network, improved system operation&#13;
and maintenance, and establishment of a computerized system for monitoring, simulating&#13;
and dispatching of irrigation water. In addition, the canal efficiency would also be&#13;
progressively monitored and evaluated with completion of the irrigation facilities. The&#13;
results would be reviewed during the interim project implementation review to be carried&#13;
out in 2000 and 2003, and changes would be made to project design, if deemed necessary.&#13;
6.21  Resources and Institutional Capacity. The other substantial risks that could&#13;
delay implementation of land settlement are:&#13;
(a)   lack of timely and adequate counterpart funds to finance project activities;&#13;
(b)   inadequate institutional capacity for project implementation; or&#13;
(c)   settlers give up and return to their original place.&#13;
&#13;

Financial requirements for voluntary emigration and land settlement of 200,000 persons&#13;
would be very large and concentrated in a few later years due to rapid implementation.&#13;
Any shortages of counterpart funds would substantially slow implementation and delay&#13;
benefits. The associated risks arising from delay in project implementation have been&#13;
reflected in the economic analysis. A two-year delay in the implementation will reduce&#13;
irrigation and drainage benefits by 5.2 percent, forestry development benefits by 4.4&#13;
percent, and livestock components by 16 percent, with an overall benefit reduction of 5.8&#13;
percent. To ensure provision of timely and adequate counterpart funds, Gansu Province&#13;
has confirmed that counterpart funds have been committed and agreed to submit annual&#13;
budgets and work programs to the Bank/IDA for review (see paras. 3.39 and 4.5). To&#13;
further assist Gansu Province in facilitating implementation of the land settlement&#13;
component, part of the local expenditures incurred under land settlement would be&#13;
disbursed against the loan/credit.&#13;
6.22  As for institutional capacity for project implementation, Gansu has many years of&#13;
successful experience in carrying out voluntary settlement in Hexi Corridor under the&#13;
"Two Xi" poverty reduction programs. Currently, voluntary settlement of 80,000 people&#13;
is in progress under the Yindaruqin Irrigation Scheme being completed under the Gansu&#13;
Provincial Development Project. Experienced staff from the Two Xi Commission and&#13;
Yindaruqin will train and guide other new project staff. The risk with implementing&#13;
capacity would be further reduced through systematic planning of settlement programs to&#13;
be carried out in stages and well integrated with the progress of land reclamation and&#13;
infrastructure construction. An effective institution would also be established to oversee,&#13;
manage and monitor the settlement programs. The possibility of large numbers of settlers&#13;
returning to their origins would be minimized by selecting settlers with positive attitudes,&#13;
motivated for emigration to improve their economic well-being, and trained to adapt to&#13;
the new environments. Overall institutional support and strengthening would be included&#13;
in the project to ensure that the operation, maintenance and management of completed&#13;
works and production activities would be sustained. Satisfactory agricultural production&#13;
models and systems are already in place in the existing irrigated areas. The agricultural&#13;
yields and production projections are based on existing models and systems, and are&#13;
therefore realistic and sustainable, and would provide both safety and adequate incomes&#13;
for new settlers.&#13;

Sumarv of Environmental Action Plan&#13;
General&#13;
A comprehensive environmental impact assessment study was jointly&#13;
carried out by China Northwest Design and Research Institute of Ministry of&#13;
Electric Power and Gansu Design Provincial Hydropower Investigation and Design&#13;
Institute of Ministry of Water Resources. The study report has identified both&#13;
adverse and positive impacts as a result of project activities and development,&#13;
and recommended appropriate measures to mitigate the adverse effects. Beside the&#13;
normal impacts resulting from construction activities, the most significant&#13;
adverse impacts are:&#13;
(a) potential increase of salinity level in the existing Shuangta Reservoir&#13;
as a result of land reclamation and salt leaching to be carried out under&#13;
the project in the Changma Irrigation Area located upstream of the&#13;
reservoir;&#13;
(b) changes to the regime of groundwater along the middle reaches of Shule&#13;
River as result of flow regulation by the Changma Dam and diversion of&#13;
water to new irrigated land developed;&#13;
(c) demand for energy by new migrants may lead to cutting of trees and&#13;
shrubs for fuelwood; and&#13;
(d) the Changma Reservoir will inundate about 131 households (566 persons)&#13;
and would require resettlement elsewhere.   (This impact has been dealt&#13;
with separately through the preparation of a Resettlement Action Plan).&#13;
Plan for Mitigation and Management&#13;
In close consultation with the design institutes who carried out the&#13;
impact study and the Bank missions, Gansu Government has drawn up a plan for&#13;
mitigation and management of the environmental impacts. The plan (see Annex D&#13;
Table 1) covers short-term and long-term impact as follows:&#13;
Short-Term: The short-term plan cover mainly mitigation of adverse effects&#13;
arising from project construction activities, sanitation, waste disposal, air and&#13;
noise pollution abatement. Disease control and treatment among the new voluntary&#13;
migrants and relocatees resettled from the Changma Reservoir area is also&#13;
included. Industrial and urban effluent polluting the Shiyou River, currently&#13;
under the implementation, will be continued with funding from the Yumen City&#13;
Government and polluting enterprises concerned.&#13;
Long-Term: The long-term plan covers monitoring of impacts on land and&#13;
water resources, including biota of plant and animals. Surface and ground water&#13;
quality, groundwater level, and salinity level in the Shuangta Reservoir will be&#13;
monitored at regular intervals up to year 2005 and beyond where necessary. Micro&#13;
climate changes and induced earthquake by the Changma Dam will also be monitored.&#13;
Implementation Schedule&#13;
The plan will be carried out through the project implementation&#13;
period from 1996 - 2005.  Some long-term plan items will be continued after&#13;
completion of the project construction in 2005. The implementation schedule is&#13;
shown in Annex D Table 2.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Estimated Costs&#13;
The total cost is estimated at Y46.2 million as summarized in Annex&#13;
D Table 3.  The main items and their estimated costs are as follows:&#13;
(a) Data collection &amp; monitoring                         Y12.5 million&#13;
(b) Equipment &amp; instruments                               19.3&#13;
(c) Installation and commissioning                         2.4&#13;
(d) Staff training                                         2.0&#13;
(e) Design, supervision and management                    10.0&#13;
Total                                       Y46.2 million&#13;
Management&#13;
The physical activities - data collection, monitoring and analytical&#13;
work will be contracted out to local environmental agencies and universities who&#13;
have the necessary capacity and competence to carry out such activities. This&#13;
would avoid the Project Office of setting up of its own establishment, leading&#13;
to duplicating staff and equipment. The Monitoring and Evaluation Division under&#13;
the Project Management Bureau will be responsible to oversee the contracted&#13;
environmental agencies, with assistance from technical specialists, if necessary.&#13;
Monitoring&#13;
A comprehensive environmental monitoring system will be established&#13;
to monitor the long-term impacts on land and water resources in the Shule River&#13;
Basin.   Technical assistance has been sought  from the International  Land&#13;
Improvement and Reclamation (ILIR) of Netherlands to plan and design the system.&#13;
Key monitoring stations will be set up prior to start of the main project work&#13;
in order to collect baseline data for comparison. The proposed system network&#13;
is generally shown in the attached sketch map to the Annex D. Key parameters to&#13;
be monitored would include: water quality parameters for both surface and&#13;
groundwater, meteorological data, water table, terrestrial and aquatic biota, and&#13;
soil salinity.&#13;
Rehabilitation of Source Areas after Emigration&#13;
Environmental rehabilitation of the source areas in the eleven&#13;
emigating counties would be planned and carried out by the local governments&#13;
after permanent emigration of the people.   Priority would be given to the&#13;
environmentally degraded areas on hilly land and cultivated land on steep slopes.&#13;
The rehabilitation would be mostly through soil and water conservation measures&#13;
which are well-tested locally and cost efficient. The measures would include&#13;
afforestation, planting of shrubs and grass, closing of hilly land and steep&#13;
slopes for cultivation, terracing and benching, and change of cropping patterns&#13;
with less emphasis on food grain cultivation. The itemized works items and cost&#13;
estimates are given in Table 4. A total of 25,000 ha would be rehabilitated in&#13;
the eleven counties at a total cost of Y13.5 million (base cost).&#13;

CHINA&#13;
GANSU HEXI CORRIDOR PROJECT&#13;
Summary of Involuntary Resettlement Action Plan'&#13;
for Chanqma Reservoir&#13;
General&#13;
1.           The planning of a dam (Changma Dam) on the Shule River to store water&#13;
for irrigation and hydropower generation dated back to the early 1960s.&#13;
Inhabitants along the Shule River valley were aware of the proposed Changma Dam&#13;
and the local government has since restricted much of the economic development&#13;
in the valley to be affected by the reservoir. The proposed Changma Dam, 55 m&#13;
high with a crest length of 350 m, would create a reservoir covering about 12 km2&#13;
of water surface area with a total storage capacity of about 194 million m3.&#13;
The reservoir would provide irrigation water to improve and develop a total of&#13;
about 98,000 ha of cropland on the Shule River alluvial plain.  Some 200,000 poor&#13;
farmers would be emigrated from upland resource poor regions in central and&#13;
southeast Gansu and settled on the 54,000 ha newly developed irrigated land. A&#13;
total of 131 families  (566 persons)  will have to be moved from the Changma&#13;
Reservoir area and resettled on a 5580-mu new resettlement site in the Huahai&#13;
Irrigation Area&#13;
Assessment of Land, People and Assets Affected&#13;
2.           Based on the latest detailed engineering survey and investigation and&#13;
(based on 1 in 5,000 topographic map), computation of backwater curve, a total&#13;
of 172 ha existing cropland and 131 families involving 566 persons in the&#13;
following three Shuixia village groups will be affected by inundation of the&#13;
proposed reservoir.&#13;

Policies, Laws and Regulations&#13;
The main policy objectives adopted by Gansu for the involuntary&#13;
resettlement are: (i) productive level and standard of living of relocatees&#13;
should not be lower than before relocation; and (ii) the rate of economic&#13;
development and improving standard of living should be comparable to that of the&#13;
local residents in the resettlement area. These policy objectives are in line&#13;
with that of the Bank's OD 4.30 on Involuntary Resettlement.&#13;
The principal laws and regulations governing the process of land&#13;
acquisition and resettlement under the project are:&#13;
(a) The Land Management Law of PRC&#13;
(b) Implementation Regulations of the Land Management Law of PRC, State&#13;
Council Document No. 73 promulgated on January 4, 1991 and effective in&#13;
February 1992.&#13;
(c) State Council Document No. 74 on Regulations on the Land Acquisition&#13;
Compensation and Resettlement for Large and Medium-sized Water Conservancy&#13;
and Hydro-electric Power Projects effective from May 1, 1991.&#13;
Consultation Processes and Participation&#13;
The inhabitants of the Changma Valley were aware of the proposed&#13;
Changma Reservoir as early as 1960s when planning of the Changma Dam was carried&#13;
out. The local government has planned and controlled development in the valley&#13;
so as to minimize acquisition of cultivated land and relocation of people when&#13;
the project is launched.&#13;
Close consultation was maintained between the Project Authority,&#13;
Gansu Design Institute, Yumen City Government, Agricultural Commission, local&#13;
governments of Changma Village and Huahai Township, and representatives of&#13;
affected village groups. Over the period three alternative sites (Bijiantan,&#13;
Nanqu Jiudui Dong and Xiahuizhuang) were considered jointly by the stakeholders&#13;
and beneficiaries for the resettlement. Xiahuizhuang was finally chosen for its&#13;
better land and water resources, and closer access (5 km) to existing community&#13;
and services in Huahai Township.&#13;
Resettlement Strategies and Alternatives&#13;
The main strategy is to ensure that living standard of the affected&#13;
people is not lower than prior to resettlement and that there will be&#13;
opportunities for further enhancement of their economic well-being comparable to&#13;
that of the host population.   To achieve this, affected households will be&#13;
resettled on land-for-land basis (4.56 mu per capita) and given housing lots for&#13;
building of their new houses.  To further develop their economic well-being,&#13;
affected households will participate in the collective production and management&#13;
of 2,000 mu commodity crops (licorice, orchards, livestock, etc), small-scale&#13;
enterprises and services. The resettlement village will be operating as a basic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 140 -&#13;
unit sharing profit and losses, thereby minimize risk in the production and&#13;
economic development activities.&#13;
Compensation Standards and Norms&#13;
Based on the "Design Specifications of Inundation Treatment of water&#13;
Conservancy and Hydro-power Projects (SD130-84)" full replacement costs have been&#13;
considered for compensation of land acquisition, relocation, infrastructure,&#13;
services, housing and moving expenses. In addition, a multiplier of 4 has been&#13;
applied in determining the compensation for land acquisition based on the average&#13;
annual output values of the last three years, and a multiplier of 3 for&#13;
resettlement compensation in accordance with the provisions of "Regulation of&#13;
Compensation for Land Acquisition and Resettlement in the Construction of Large&#13;
and medium-sized Water resources and Hydro-power Projects". The average value&#13;
of three years output value (1992-94) is Y462.86 per mu as shown in Annex E Table&#13;
1. This average value has been used in determining the compensation for land&#13;
acquisition (x4) and resettlement (x3) per mu.&#13;
Evaluation for Compensation&#13;
The amount of compensation evaluated for land acquisition,&#13;
resettlement, replacement for infrastructure and services are itemized in Annex&#13;
E Table 2. The total amount is Y17.5 million, including expenses for training&#13;
of relocatees, management and contingencies.&#13;
Compensation and Use of Funds&#13;
The total amount of Y17.5 million compensation assessed will be used&#13;
for the following purposes:&#13;
(a) Development of resettlement site       Y8,370,000  (Table 3)&#13;
(b) Payment to local government for&#13;
reconstruction of infrastructure&#13;
and services affected in the&#13;
Changma Reservoir area                 Y  467,800&#13;
(c) Cleaning of reservoir area             Y   15,000&#13;
(d) Direct compensation payment&#13;
to affected households resettled       Y5,750,000&#13;
(e) Transportation in relocation, and&#13;
compensation for loss of earning       Y  191,200&#13;
(f) Management, training, monitoring&#13;
and physical contingency               Y2,720,000&#13;
Total                          Y17,513.000&#13;
Policy Incentives&#13;
Subject to government approval, the policy incentives proposed for&#13;
the relocatees are as follows:&#13;
(a) supply of building materials at State-controlled prices;&#13;
(b) 50% subsidy for production fertilizer for the first four years;&#13;
(c) exemption from or reduced payment of taxes on land, housing lot,&#13;
special agricultural and forestry products for an initial period of years;&#13;
(d) subsidized tariff for electricity supply;&#13;
(e) exemption or reduced irrigation water charges for the initial period&#13;
of years; and&#13;
(f) preference for employment in enterprises and enrollment in school for&#13;
children.&#13;
Implementation Schedule&#13;
Initial development of the resettlement site will begin in 1996 and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 141 -&#13;
the actual physical relocation and resettlement of the affected households will&#13;
be carried out in two phases, 1998 and 1999, to be completed before flooding of&#13;
the Changma Reservoir in December 2000. The implementation schedule is shown in&#13;
Annex E Table 4.&#13;
Management and Supervision&#13;
The Yumen City Government through its Resettlement Office will be&#13;
primarily responsible for the implementation and management of the resettlement&#13;
program under the direction of the Project Management Bureau (PMB) . One station&#13;
each will be established in Changma Village and the Huahai Township to carry out&#13;
the relocation and resettlement, and ultimate rehabilitation in the resettlement&#13;
area. The organization structure is shown in Annex E Chart 1. Funds will be&#13;
allocated by PMB to the Yumen City Government based on the planned programs&#13;
approved. The planned annual expenditures are shown in Annex E Table 5. The&#13;
funds will be administered by the Yumen City Government according to normal&#13;
government financial procedures and regulations.&#13;
Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
Monitoring and evaluation of the people resettled will be carried out&#13;
by National Research Center for Resettlement (Hehai University) in collaboration&#13;
with Gansu Design Institute for a period of five years or until they are&#13;
satisfactorily rehabilitated.  The scope and content of M&amp;E are given in the&#13;
Appendix to the main RAP. Periodic M&amp;E reports will be submitted to the Project&#13;
Management Bureau and the Bank/IDA for review and follow-up actions.&#13;

Poverty Background&#13;
1.          Gansu Province has about 4.2 million people living below the&#13;
threshold of poverty in 41 officially identified poor counties, mostly located&#13;
in central and south Gansu. These counties are located in resource poor areas&#13;
with an increasing population to support in a much degraded environment. In&#13;
some of the remote townships, the poor people are unable to feed themselves&#13;
and have to rely on government for relief annually. The economic situations&#13;
of the 41 poor counties are summarized in Table 1. Since 1983, with the&#13;
establishment of Two Xi Commission in Gansu, poverty reduction programs have&#13;
been undertaken to help these poor people. The programs included out-&#13;
migration and settlement in better resource areas in Hexi Corridor and other&#13;
regions of the province. To-date, a total of 337,000 people have settled in&#13;
Hexi Corridor and other irrigated areas in the Yellow River valley. Although&#13;
the Two Xi poverty reduction programs have been successful, but the scale was&#13;
quite modest due to limited resources. Therefore, Gansu has proposed a major&#13;
10-year program to settle 200,000 poor people from central and south Gansu to&#13;
Hexi Corridor and at the same to develop large tract of cultivable land for&#13;
production of grain and commodity crops to ease current deficits faced by the&#13;
province.&#13;
Selection Criteria&#13;
2.          The selection criteria used are as follows:&#13;
(a) County/Township Counties and townships planned for emigration are&#13;
based essentially on their poor economic situations (per capita income of less&#13;
than Y300 and grain production of less than 150 kg), have not benefitted or&#13;
substantially benefitted from the Two Xi poverty reduction programs, degraded&#13;
environments with most of the cultivation on steep land, and high density of&#13;
population. To achieve maximum impact, preference has also been given to&#13;
those counties and townships that would form a contiguous group.&#13;
(b) Emigrants Emigration will be strictly voluntary by application from&#13;
rural people residing within the planned townships. Selection of prospective&#13;
emigrants will be based on a two-stage selection criteria established below:&#13;
First Stage:&#13;
(i) per capita income of less than Y300 and grain production &lt;150 kg;&#13;
(ii) at least two workers in the household with the head of the&#13;
household between the age of 18 and 50 years;&#13;
(iii) at least two years of primary education or acceptable literacy&#13;
level (relaxed for minority applicants);&#13;
(iv) experience in agricultural production; and&#13;
(v) in good health, mentally sound, and not physically handicapped.&#13;
Second Stage:&#13;
(i) per capita income less than Y150 and grain production &lt;50 kg;&#13;
(ii) demonstrate intensive desire to emigrate;&#13;
(iii) 75% of the existing cultivated land is on slope above 25 degree;&#13;
(iv) possess junior middle school education, technical skill and&#13;
vocational training; and&#13;

project files.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 156 -&#13;
(v) demonstrate pioneering spirit and leadership.&#13;
3.          The second stage criteria will only be used in the event the&#13;
number of applicants far exceeded the number of places available. Some 101 of&#13;
the emigrants with higher incomes and possessing high motivation and technical&#13;
skills will also be specially selected for early settlement to serve as lead&#13;
or demonstration farmers to other migrants. Preference will be given to&#13;
minority applicants to fill the planned number of minority emigrants for each&#13;
township. The literacy level requirements for minority applicants will also&#13;
be somewhat relaxed in view of their lower literacy level.&#13;
Counties/Townships Selected for Emigration&#13;
4,          The selected eleven counties covering 95 townships with the&#13;
numbers of planned emigrants and minority emigrants for each township are&#13;
shown in Table 2. The number of emigrants indicated for each township is&#13;
strictly for planning purposes only. The actual numbers of emigrants and the&#13;
village groups will only be determined after emigration applications have been&#13;
received and processed. However, flexibility will be maintained in the final&#13;
determination of number of emigrants between village groups under each&#13;
township, and also between townships in the event the planned number of&#13;
emigrants cannot be filled. The total number of emigrants planned is 200,000&#13;
persons with 50,000 (25%) from minority groups.&#13;
Consultation and Participation Processes&#13;
5.          There is over-whelming enthusiasm to emigrate to Hexi Corridor in&#13;
view of the better economic prospects. The planned 200,000 people represent&#13;
the optimum number of new migrants that Hexi Corridor will be able to&#13;
accommodate with the resources to be developed under the project. The&#13;
stakeholders in the source areas (county and township governments) as well as&#13;
the host governments (Anxi County and Yumen City) have been closely consulted&#13;
in the planning and design of the emigration and settlement plan. The&#13;
stakeholders will also be represented in the advisory and consultative&#13;
committees and groups to work closely with the project implementation&#13;
authorities. At the grassroots level, village emigration/settlement groups&#13;
will be formed to inform and receive applications from intending emigrants.&#13;
Representatives of emigrants, including local community and religious leaders,&#13;
will be included in these village groups.&#13;
6.          A systematically planned participatory process will be used to&#13;
inform and involve the people in the source areas. The village&#13;
emigration/settlement groups will use mass media to inform the people of the&#13;
planned emigration and settlement programs. This will include radio&#13;
broadcast, public meeting, notification, handouts, visits to settlement areas&#13;
by emigrant representatives, and talks by successful immigrants in their own&#13;
original villages.&#13;
7.          Each emigration applicant will receive an information package,&#13;
informing him of the emigration and settlement programs, prospects, risks,&#13;
government assistance in emigration and settlement, land allocation and lease,&#13;
infrastructure and services provided in the settlement areas, incentives and&#13;
policy preferences for immigrants, returns expected by government, emigrant's&#13;
responsibility, default and penalty. Details of application, processing and&#13;
selection procedures will also be included in the information package.&#13;
New Settlement Planned in Project Area&#13;
8.          Sixteen new townships/sub-farms have been planned in three&#13;
irrigation areas (Changma, Shuangta and Huahai) in Shule River Basin under the&#13;
project. Details are given in Table 3. Under these 16 townships/sub-farms&#13;
160 administrative villages will be established, each with 5 to 10 residential&#13;
village groups containing 250 - 300 families each. Each township/sub-farm&#13;
will have a population of 12,500 - 13,500 people.  During the initial stage of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 157 -&#13;
settlement, basic education (primary and secondary schools) and health&#13;
facilities will be provided by the project to each township and village.&#13;
Later, as the settlement areas stabilize and grow, the local governments will&#13;
provide other necessary amenities and services.&#13;
Minority Emigrants&#13;
9.          The main minority groups in Central and Southeast Gansu are the&#13;
Dongxiang, Islamic Hui and Tibetans. No separate settlement plan has been&#13;
proposed for the minority emigrants, but they will enjoy the same economic&#13;
benefits as the Hans. However, provisions of the Bank OD 4.20 on Indigenous&#13;
Peoples have been considered in the settlement programs to ensure that the&#13;
minority groups will have their socio-cultural traditions retained as far as&#13;
possible. For this purpose, major minority groups will be settled in one&#13;
community according to their wishes. One township will be exclusively&#13;
established for the Dongxiang minority emigrants and 10 villages for the&#13;
Islamic Hui emigrants. Minority community and religious leaders will serve on&#13;
the local township and village settlement groups to help to resolve any issues&#13;
relating to minority groups. Minority migrants will also enjoy the same&#13;
incentives as the Han migrants in addition to the current government policy&#13;
preference given to minority people in employment, enrollment in schools for&#13;
minority children, and exemption for payment of school fees and text books.&#13;
The demographic and socio-economic comparisons between the main minority&#13;
groups and the Chinese Hans, represented by typical emigrating counties, are&#13;
summarized in Table 4.&#13;
Settlement Subsidies&#13;
10.         For each emigrant, the government will provide the following&#13;
subsidies over the period of two years:&#13;
Direct subsidy to emiqrants&#13;
(a) Relocating expenses                                Y350&#13;
(b) Construction of house                                400&#13;
(c) Purchase of production inputs                         90&#13;
(d) Purchase of agricultural tools, etc                   60&#13;
(e) Purchase of coal for heating, cooking                100&#13;
(f) Water supply                                          60&#13;
(g) Electricity                                           40&#13;
Sub-total                                 Y1.100&#13;
Indirect subsidy for amenities and services&#13;
(h) Primary and secondary schools                      Y272&#13;
(i) Health facilities                                     42&#13;
(j) Tubewells                                             19&#13;
Sub-total                                  Y333&#13;
Total                                     Y1.433 oer capita&#13;
11.         In addition, the cost for management and monitoring of the&#13;
emigrants is estimated at Y31.5 per capita, excluding the cost of new migrants&#13;
training estimated at YB.5 million for 7,200 migrants in about 300,000 person-&#13;
sessions. The overall total settlement base cost is estimated at Y292.9&#13;
million for 200,000 people or Y1,465 per capita. In addition to the above&#13;
financial subsidies, all migrants will be exempted from payment of taxes&#13;
(land, agricultural and forestry products) and rent for the first three years&#13;
of their settlement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 158 -&#13;
Land Distribution &amp; Lease to Settlers&#13;
12.         In the settlement areas, each migrant will be allocated basic 2.0&#13;
mu irrigated land on land use contracts for 30 years without payment (about 10&#13;
mu or 0.67 ha per household of five) for crop cultivation, beside 534 m2 for&#13;
housing and 667 m2 for fruit tree and vegetable gardens. In addition, each&#13;
migrant will also be eligible to lease additional 1.5 to 2.0 mu (0.1 - 0.133&#13;
ha) of land with phased rent payments; zero for 1st - 3rd year, Y75 per mu for&#13;
4th - 6th year, and Y150 for 7th - 10th year. After the 10th year, the lease&#13;
is subject to negotiations and renewal. Larger family farms at 10 ha per&#13;
household will also be promoted, but the number will be limited to 150&#13;
households.&#13;
Training of New Migrants in Settlement Areas&#13;
13.         New migrant farmers from central and southeast Gansu settling in&#13;
Hexi Corridor will have no experience in irrigated agriculture, multi-cropping&#13;
systems integrated with livestock and forestry in a totally new environment.&#13;
They will need training in irrigation techniques, multi-cropping, livestock&#13;
and forestry production systems. An integrated training plan has been&#13;
prepared by a special working group appointed by the Project Management Bureau&#13;
(PMB). The detailed training program is given in Table 5. It will cover&#13;
7,200 township and village technical staff and lead farmers, and about 300,000&#13;
person-sessions for general farmers on various topics. The total estimated&#13;
cost is Y8.44 million over the a 10-year period. The working group has been&#13;
retained to supervise and monitor the implementation and performance of the&#13;
training plan.&#13;
Women Migrants in Development&#13;
14.         Women migrants would be encouraged to participate in the project&#13;
development activities. Special interventions have been designed to cater to&#13;
their specific needs. These are summarized in Table 6. The programs include&#13;
specific targets for employment in the public sector and service sectors,&#13;
construction, rural enterprises, and financial assistance in the development&#13;
of small family-run business and cottage industries. Women migrants would be&#13;
given preference in obtaining credit under the project' revolving fund of Y15&#13;
million. It is projected that by the end of the project implementation period&#13;
some 4,000 women migrants or about one third of the total women migrants would&#13;
have received vocational training.   The performance and impact of women&#13;
participation in project development would be monitored based on the program&#13;
indicators in Table 6.&#13;
Estimated Costs for Settlement&#13;
15.         The total base cost for settlement is estimated at Y292.9 million&#13;
(Y489.9 million including physical and price contingencies). The itemized&#13;
costs and the planned investment over a 10-year period are summarized in Table&#13;
7.&#13;
Settlement Management&#13;
16.         The annual emigration and settlement programs, approved by the&#13;
Project Management Bureau, will be implemented and managed by the existing&#13;
County Settlement Offices (CSOs) in each of the eleven emigrating counties in&#13;
central and southeast Gansu and the two host county/city responsible for the&#13;
new settlement areas in Hexi Corridor. The respective County&#13;
Emigration/Settlement Committee will sign annual contracts with the PMB and&#13;
supervise the CSO for the implementation. Funds for the emigration and&#13;
settlement based on approved programs will be allocated annually to the&#13;
county/city governments by the PMB. The overall organization structure for&#13;
the implementation and management is shown in Chart 3 of the SAR.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 159 -&#13;
Monitoring &amp; Evaluation&#13;
17.         A comprehensive monitoring system will be established under the&#13;
project to be operated by the Demographic Research Institute of the Lanzhou&#13;
University in Gansu Province. The system will be used to screen and select&#13;
emigrant applicants based on weighted criteria and to create a data base of&#13;
the emigrants selected. A 10% sample size of the migrant households will be&#13;
tracked annually to monitor their socio-economic progress and compare their&#13;
performance against the planned targets. The annual monitoring and evaluation&#13;
results will be used by the project management authorities in the planning of&#13;
programs for the subsequent years and also for the Mid-Term Review exercise to&#13;
be conducted for the project in 1999. More details of performance targets and&#13;
impact monitoring are given in Annex H.&#13;

1.0   PROJECT BACKGROUND&#13;
The Gansu Hexi Corridor Project is a multi-purpose water resources development project&#13;
to accommodate an increase in population of 200,000 being relocated from extreme poor&#13;
areas of Gansu Province. The Project requires the construction of the Changma&#13;
Reservoir on the Shule River, approximately 540 km of diversion canals and 970 km of&#13;
irrigation canals and 450 km of drainage ditches. The design flows within the main&#13;
diversion canals are between 30 to 42 m3/s, and between I - 9 m3/s for the secondary&#13;
canals. The joint operation of the Changma Reservoir with the exiting Shuangta&#13;
Reservoir, located downstream on the Shule River, and the Chijinxia Reservoir on the&#13;
Shiyou River, would be able to regulate as much as 90.40 of the surface runoffs. The&#13;
cultivated areas within the Changma, Shuangta and Huahai irrigation command areas&#13;
could be increased by 54,600 ha, from the current value of 43,600 ha to 98,200 ha. Other&#13;
usage within the project area include industrial and domestic consumptions. Ground&#13;
water augmentation will be required for all three irrigation command areas with the use&#13;
of about 900 wells.&#13;
Four hydroelectric power stations are planned to be installed at the Changma Reservoir,&#13;
14.25 MW, the Changma Dam intake of the new trunk canal, 12 MW, the west main&#13;
canal, 6 MW, and the Shuangta Reservoir, 2.4 MW. In order to ensure the efficient use&#13;
of the water resources and the effective distribution of available water, and a sustainable&#13;
extraction of ground water, an integrated monitoring, simulation and dispatch system&#13;
will be required.&#13;
2.0   SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES&#13;
The integrated monitoring, simulation and dispatch system will be able to monitor the&#13;
state of operation of the entire project, including the operation of all three reservoirs, the&#13;
flow conditions of all hydroelectric stations, discharges at key locations along the&#13;
diversion and irrigation canals, discharges at the drainage ditches, quantity of ground&#13;
water extractions and meteorological variables. Automatic monitoring should be&#13;
provided for water levels and discharges of all three reservoirs, and flow conditions of&#13;
the trunk, main, and sub-main canals. Other variables should be observed manually at&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 175 -&#13;
proper intervals or obtained through interfacing with the environmental monitoring&#13;
database.&#13;
The integrated monitoring, simulation and dispatch svstem will have the capability to&#13;
simulate the operation of the entire system to evaluate system operation strategy, for&#13;
irrigation diversion as the primarv objective and hydroelectric power generation and to&#13;
forecast short term system behaviour. It is noted that the daily load variations may be&#13;
incorporated into short term diversion operation.&#13;
The monitoring of the svstem will ensure a smooth and efficient operation for water&#13;
distribution within the svstem. To provide effective control of the distribution and to&#13;
eliminate potential human operational errors, flows control gates to the trunk canals, the&#13;
main canals, and to the sub-main canals could be controlled automatically. Therefore,&#13;
as many as 26 gates can be included, among which 17 are located in Changma, 5 at&#13;
Shuangta, and 4 at Huahal imgation areas. While the releases at the hydropower stations&#13;
are regulated by system diversion operations, flood control procedures of individual&#13;
reservoir, whenever necessary, will take precedence.&#13;
The monitoring system will also provide a database on the system operation, so that the&#13;
dynamics of the entire system can be examined, and system operation strategy can be&#13;
refined towards a more optimal conjunctive use of the available water resources within&#13;
the Shule-Shiyou River Basin. Manual input of data will be necessary for manually&#13;
observed variables. Interface with the environmental monitoring database will probably&#13;
be required. The use of GIS can be considered if its use is shown necessary to enhance&#13;
the usability and to simplify the user interface.&#13;
In order to provide the planning staff with a complete view of the agnrcultural&#13;
productions from the operation. periodic data on cultivated areas from all three irrigation&#13;
command areas can be considered as part of the database, if these information has not&#13;
been included in other component of the project. The production data can be surveyed&#13;
and entered to the database manually.&#13;
3.0   SYSTEM STRUCTURE AND COMPONENTS&#13;
a.    Monitoring and Management Information System&#13;
The operation of the entire Hexi Corridor Project will be monitored from a&#13;
control centre located at the Project Management Office in Yumen Township.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 176 -&#13;
Both spatial and temporal state variables of major components of the Project and&#13;
meteorological data, such as precipitation, air temperature, evaporation and wind&#13;
speed. will be monitored, stored and archived with the use of a database.&#13;
Sampling frequency or observation intervals will depend on the dynamics of the&#13;
variables. Sampling of the state variables, which are monitored automatically,&#13;
mav be performed at source or at the control centre. A list of variables to be&#13;
included in the svstem database will be required together with their&#13;
corresponding characteristics, which will include, but not limited to, the&#13;
following: name, location, data format, and sampling frequency or interval.&#13;
Basic data processing, such as error checking, checking of data range, basic&#13;
statistics, and basic data presentations, should be provided.&#13;
b.    Transmission and Communication&#13;
Remote sensing sites can be linked to several sub-stations, located at the&#13;
Management Offices of the three irrigation command areas. These sub-stations&#13;
will then be linked to the control centre at the Hexi Corridor Project Management&#13;
Centre. via a proven and reliable mode of data transmission. A microwave&#13;
communication system is planned for the project to link all operational units.&#13;
This system can be considered and adopted for data transmission. Other&#13;
alternatives, such as linking the monitoring stations directly to the Project&#13;
Management Centre, can be considered if shown to be more efficient.&#13;
Transmission frequency and the amount of data transmitted will depend on the&#13;
design of the monitoring system.&#13;
c.    Computer Modelling&#13;
A computer model will be requtired to simulate the operation of the entire system&#13;
covering all major system components for flow regulations, diversions, ground&#13;
water extractions, drainage, and hydroelectric generations. This model should&#13;
be capable of evaluating different operation strategies for decision making, and&#13;
should considered the temporal and spatial variations of discharges within the&#13;
system. Development of the computer model should be based on proven&#13;
computer codes and interface to the system database should be provided.&#13;
As the combined length of the main diversion canal and the west main canal is&#13;
over 80 km, it may be necessary to have the computer model, or perhaps a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 177 -&#13;
dynamic flow routing model, to verify the short term diversion schedule. The&#13;
computer model(s) should be versatile enough for future updating.&#13;
d.    System Interface&#13;
User interface should be provided for ease of use of the various components of&#13;
the computer system. The development of the user interface can be considered&#13;
as a separate component, or be partially integrated with the system database and&#13;
the modelling software.&#13;
4.0   EQUIPMENT AND METHODOLOGY&#13;
4.1    Office Space&#13;
The control centre can be housed in the building of the Administration Bureau of the&#13;
Shule River Basin located in Yumen Township. Approximately 300 m2 of office space&#13;
will be required.&#13;
4.2   Hardware&#13;
Equipment for the control and monitoring of the hydroelectric power stations will be&#13;
included with the installation of the power stations. Only hardware required for&#13;
monitoring the canals, simulation and automatic gate controls are included here. The&#13;
monitoring, simulation, and dispatch system will probably be a micro-computer based&#13;
system. It is anticipated that the following hardware will be required:&#13;
a micro-computer system, which will be used as the server,&#13;
a micro-computer system, which will be used at the control centre;&#13;
micro-computers for sub-stations;&#13;
pnnters;&#13;
a tablet;&#13;
communication system hardware,&#13;
UPS's,&#13;
water level sensors with interface:&#13;
flow meters with interface.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 178 -&#13;
4.3   Software&#13;
General commercial software should be used if possible. for the operating system,&#13;
database, networking, and supporting utilities. Efficient exchange of data with other&#13;
project components should be considered in their selection.&#13;
Simulation model of the svstem should be developed from proven computer codes, and&#13;
should be easilv portable among operating platforms. Proprietary models or models for&#13;
which source codes are not disclosed should not be selected, unless their usability and&#13;
functionalitv are overwhelmingly superior.&#13;
5.0   TECHNICAL INPUTS&#13;
The integrated monitoring, simulation and dispatch system is not expected to be very&#13;
complicated. The monitoring system of state variables is straight forward. However, the&#13;
development of the simulation computer model for operational decision making require&#13;
thorough understanding of the dynamic relationships among various components of the&#13;
system and numerical simulation techniques. Therefore, two expert advisors, either&#13;
intemational or domestic, on telemetry in water resources, and water resources system&#13;
simulation are recommended. Perhaps, a hardware specialist on computing and&#13;
communication hardware should be consulted.&#13;
6.0   IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE&#13;
As the diversion canals are not expected to be completed until the 7th year of the project,&#13;
the hardware system selection and acquisition should be conducted the earliest in the 4 dh&#13;
year of the project, in order to take advantage in the latest technological developments&#13;
and to provide a relatively continuous therefore more efficient, execution of this project&#13;
component. The following implementation schedule is provided based on a seven-year&#13;
project implementation period. If the implementation period is scheduled to be longer,&#13;
all activities from vear 4 on should be postponed accordingly. The development of the&#13;
simulation model for the svstem should be carried out at the beginning of the project.&#13;
a.    Planning and Design&#13;
Planning and design of the simulation model for the system should begin&#13;
immediatelv with no conflict with other components of the project. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 179 -&#13;
simulation modelling software should be developed first and preliminary runs&#13;
should be conducted with the current available data to verify the system&#13;
configuration. Then the monitoring network should be established, which would&#13;
be followed by the design of the database and the monitoring and control system&#13;
during year 5 of the project.&#13;
The computer modelling software of the system can be developed together with&#13;
the simulations of the system with the currently available data, within the first&#13;
year of the project implementation. The planning of the monitoring network and&#13;
the database can then follow.&#13;
b.    Equipment Acquisition&#13;
A svstem of micro-computer, such as a PC-Pentium- 100, together with adequate&#13;
accessories, should be acquired for the computer modelling software&#13;
development and model simulations at the beginning of the project&#13;
implementation. Other equipment can be acquired at the beginning of year 6.&#13;
C.    Installation and Implementation&#13;
The first micro-computer system for the development of the simulation software&#13;
should be installed at the beginning of the project implementation phase. The&#13;
development of the simulation model and the preliminary runs should be&#13;
conducted within year 1, with limited activities in the following years.&#13;
The design of the monitoring and automatic control system and the database&#13;
should begin in year 5. Acquisition of required hardware should commence in&#13;
the second half of year 5.&#13;
The development of the database should follow as soon as the server computer&#13;
is installed (in mid-year 6). The installation of automatic monitoring devices and&#13;
computer system as sub-stations should begin as soon as the civil structures are&#13;
ready (year 6). The installation of the data communications devices will follow&#13;
as soon as the microwave system and the communication hardware are installed&#13;
(late vear 6 to eariv year 7). The installation testing of the complete monitoring,&#13;
simulation and dispatch system should be concluded by mid-year 7.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 180 -&#13;
7.0   Training of Operation Staff&#13;
Training of operation staff is a important part of the monitoring, simulation and dispatch&#13;
system, particularly operation and planning personnel responsible for the execution of&#13;
the simulation, database maintenance, and computer system operations. Other training&#13;
should include gate operators, well operators, canal inspectors and maintenance crew.&#13;
User manuals for the execution of the simulation model, database, and svstem operations&#13;
should be produced, which can be used as training materials for the operation and&#13;
planning personnel. Operation manuals for gate and well operations should be provided&#13;
for the field operators.&#13;

Gansu's Experience in Canal Lining&#13;
1.          Located in northwest China, Gansu has a dry and cold climate.  The&#13;
Project area in Hexi Corridor has annual average rainfall of 47 - 160 mm,&#13;
evaporation of 2,000 - 3,050 mm, average monthly low temperature of -8.1 to -&#13;
16.7 degree C, with absolute low temperature of -24 to -29.3 degree C. The&#13;
ground freezing depth ranges from 0.8 to 1.8 meters. Therefore, canal lining&#13;
works for preventing seepage and their damages by frost heave during winter&#13;
are of particular importance in Gansu. In this respect Gansu has accumulated&#13;
considerable years of successful experience. Types of canal lining, based on&#13;
materials to be used, are as follows:&#13;
(a) dry stone blocks&#13;
(b) block in cement pitching (conglomerates or cut stone blocks)&#13;
(c) concrete (precast and in-situ)&#13;
(d) plastic membrane&#13;
The type of canal lining used depends on the availability of local materials,&#13;
swelling characteristics of the base soil materials, water table level, and&#13;
flow velocity in canals. Canal lining cross-sections are mostly stepped&#13;
trapezoidal and also some with parabolic base, vertical sides, and U-shaped.&#13;
Cross-sections with parabolic base and U-Shaped are more resistant to frost&#13;
heave caused by swelling of soil. But U-shaped sections are generally of&#13;
precast concrete units or cast in-situ concrete, mostly used on smaller canals&#13;
below branch canal with lower flow velocity.&#13;
Dry Block Conglomerate Lining:  Mainly used in areas where local&#13;
conglomerate stones are available at site. Roughness factor is about 0.0275&#13;
to 0.03. Lining thickness is less than 20 cm and can stand up to velocity of&#13;
3 m/sec. Although economic but less effective in seepage prevention,&#13;
averaging with 2.6% per km canal seepage losses.&#13;
Cut Blocks in Cement Pitching:  The roughness factor is about 0.0275 and&#13;
lining can stand flow velocity up to 4 m/sec. Resist frost heave better than&#13;
concrete lining.&#13;
Concrete Lining: This is the main type of lining used in Gansu. It has&#13;
been extensively used in mid- and down-stream areas of Shule River and Hedong&#13;
Loess Area where conglomerate stones are scarce. Due to difficulty in&#13;
repairing cracks of in-situ concrete lining caused by frost heave, more&#13;
precast concrete linings have been used instead. Seepage loss is about 0.4%&#13;
per km canal with seepage rate of 0.12 to 0.14 cu.m./m2/day.&#13;

Polyvinal Plastic Membrane:  There two methods of use.  First, the&#13;
membrane is used together with concrete lining.  The concrete panels prevent&#13;
scouring and damages to plastic membranes and its ageing through weathering.&#13;
This method is used mostly on canals with larger flow velocity. Second, the&#13;
membrane is covered with a layer of protective soil or gravel. This method&#13;
can only be used in area with high water table and low velocity flow in canal&#13;
(generally less than 1 m/sec). Seepage prevention by plastic membrane is&#13;
effective with seepage losses at 0.01' per km canal or seepage rate of 0.12 to&#13;
0.14 cu.m./m2/day.&#13;
Frost Heave Prevention Measures&#13;
2.          Based on Gansu's several years of experiment and operation&#13;
experience, the main method is to replace the silty or clayey sub-soil&#13;
supporting canal linings with a more sandy and gravely soil materials. The&#13;
thickness of sub-soil replacement layer depends on natural site conditions.&#13;
In areas with lower water table, thin layer of light soil with sandy gravel&#13;
soil beneath, the thickness of sub-soil replacement layer, including the&#13;
thickness of concrete lining, should be not less than half of the maximum&#13;
freezing depth. This would basically eliminate damages caused by frost heave.&#13;
In areas with higher water table, canal bed with clayey or heavy loam soils,&#13;
the thickness of replacement layer should be 70% to 80% of the maximum&#13;
freezing depth to be effective against frost heave.&#13;
Proposed Canal Lining for Gansu Hexi Corridor (Shule River) Project&#13;
3.          Gansu Hexi Corridor (Shule River) Project will cover 98,200 ha of&#13;
irrigated land in Changma, Shuangta and Huahai Irrigation Areas. The canal&#13;
system includes trunk, main, sub-main, branch, lateral, sub-lateral and field&#13;
canals with varied soil conditions and water table levels. The maximum&#13;
freezing depth also varies. Therefore, the types of canal lining described&#13;
above will be encountered. The five types of canal lining proposed for the&#13;
Hexi Project is further clarified below:&#13;
(a) Type I: The canal bed is constructed with either in-situ or precast&#13;
concrete with side slopes in precast concrete slabs or panels without sub-soil&#13;
sandy gravel replacement layer. This type of canal lining is to be used for&#13;
canals running over gravely soil and without the need for frost heave&#13;
prevention, and with flow velocity less than 3.5 m/sec. The precast units can&#13;
be mass produced and installed with flexibility in work schedule. The Type I&#13;
lining will be used mostly on the branch canals of the New West Main Canal and&#13;
the connecting canals to the Old West main Canal in Changma Irrigation Area,&#13;
most of the Xihu sub-main canals, and the first 4.6 km of the Sub-main Canal&#13;
No. 1 of the Changma Trunk Canal.&#13;
(b) Type II: The canal bed and slopes will be constructed with in-situ&#13;
concrete without the sub-soil replacement layer. This type of lining is to be&#13;
used in area with sandy/gravely soils with no frost heave conditions. It can&#13;
stand up to flow velocity of 3.5 to 5.0 m/sec. This type of lining is&#13;
structurally good with little seepage losses, but less flexible in&#13;
construction scheduling than Type I. It will used mainly on improvement of&#13;
&#13;

the Changma Trunk Canal, Changma New West Canal, Sandaoguo Conveyance Canal,&#13;
and others.&#13;
(c) Type III: The canal bed is laid with block pitching and side slopes&#13;
with precast concrete units with 40 cm of sub-soil replacement layer. This&#13;
type of lining is used on canals with steeper gradient, higher flow velocity,&#13;
higher degree of material movement and scouring due to soil upheaval. The&#13;
block pitching is generally 25 to 30 cm and side slope precast units of 8 cm&#13;
thickness. The sub-soil replacement layer will depend on the soil upheaval&#13;
characteristics, freezing depth, sub-soil conditions, and cross-section of&#13;
canals. This type of lining will be used at the end stretch of the Changma&#13;
East Main Canal and the upper stretch of Huahai Trunk Canal (Ch. 7+750 and&#13;
above).&#13;
(d) Tvye IV: The canal bed is laid with in-situ concrete with side&#13;
slopes in precast concrete units of 8 cm (6 cm for branch canals), with sub-&#13;
soil replacement layer of sandy/gravely soil of 60 to 80 cm thick. This type&#13;
of lining is used for canals with flow velocity up to 3.5 m/sec and higher&#13;
degree of frost heave is expected. It will be used for Changma North Main&#13;
Canal, Anxi North and South Main Canals, and part of Xihu Sub-main Canal&#13;
Improvement.&#13;
(e) Tvye V: This type uses plastic membrane of 0.18 to 0.2 mm and a&#13;
cover protective soil layer. The soil protective layer consists of a top&#13;
layer 40 to 50 cm of gravel and a bottom layer of loam soil. This type of&#13;
lining is suitable for canals with severe frost heave, flatter gradient and&#13;
lower flow velocity. For higher flow velocity, the top protective layer will&#13;
need to be protected by a layer of coarser gravely materials to prevent&#13;
scouring of the protective layer. This type of lining will be used in the new&#13;
stretch of the Anxi North Main Canal, Changma North Sub-main Canal, and middle&#13;
stretch of the existing Changma East main Canal, and branch canals with low&#13;
flow velocity.&#13;
Typical Designs&#13;
4.          The five typical designs proposed and their respective estimated&#13;
construction cost is summarized in the attached technical characteristics&#13;
table.&#13;
Construction, Operation and Maintenance&#13;
5.          It is important to consider the following:&#13;
(a) In-situ concrete-lined canals are difficult to maintain and repair&#13;
after damaged. Therefore, its quality of construction for the foundation base&#13;
and in-situ concrete should be high to avoid deformation and consequent frost&#13;
heave damages.&#13;
(b) For precast concrete-lined canals, the high quality of precast&#13;
concrete units should be ensured and the mortar jointing should be tight and&#13;
firm to prevent cracking and falling of the jointing materials, leading to&#13;
&#13;

seepage.  The seepage water will carry clayey soil materials and contaminate&#13;
the sub-soil sandy/gravely replacement layer, thereby inducing frost heave of&#13;
the replacement layer and causing damages to the lining.&#13;
(c) Expansion/contraction joints should be properly constructed,&#13;
otherwise seepage will lead to contamination of the replacement layer and its&#13;
subsequent frost heave.&#13;
(d) The clayey soil content of the sandy/gravely sub-soil replacement&#13;
layer should confirm to design specifications, otherwise the replacement&#13;
layers will not achieve its swelling/upheaval prevention functions.&#13;
(e) All canals with linings should stop operation before freezing to&#13;
prevent damages by icing action.&#13;
(f) All canals with linings should be inspected according to timed&#13;
schedule and repaired in time to avoid major problems occurring.&#13;

            China - Gansu Hexi Corridor Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The main objectives of the Gansu Hexi
            Corridor Project are to: 1) alleviate poverty of some
            200,000 poor farmers from the resource poor areas of central
            and southeast Gansu Province by emigrating and settling on
            newly developed irrigated land in the Hexi Corridor; 2)
            increase agricultural production in the Gansu Province,
            especially in food grains and commodity crops; and 3)
            protect and restore degraded environments. The principal
            project components are: 1) Changma Dam on Shule River to
            provide effective storage of about 100 million cubic meters
            of water for irrigation and water supply; 2) irrigation and
            drainage; 3) agriculture, including crop production, support
            services, agrimachinery services and livestock production;
            4) land settlement for 200,000 immigrant farmers; 5)
            environmental protection and management through
            afforestation, monitoring, soil and water conservation
            practices; and 6) institutional strengthening and support
            through provision of staff training, technical assistance,
            equipment, vehicles and essential facilities.
