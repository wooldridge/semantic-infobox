Economic, political, and social changes underway in key economies&#13;
in Africa bode well for building the foundation for the sustainable&#13;
private sector development that has long eluded the region. Many&#13;
countries continue to face problems that stifle development, but as&#13;
IFC's regional strategy matured in economies with favorable environ-&#13;
ments, new investment approvals hit record levels during FY 2000.&#13;
Some countries made dramatic progress toward stable government over the past year.&#13;

in a new generation of leadership in Africa's largest stride toward democratic rule. In&#13;
Nigeria, the newly elected civilian government strengthened the rule of law by attacking&#13;

Poised between sustained private sector-led growth and threats to&#13;
that growth, the Latin America and Caribbean region is at a crossroads.&#13;
On the positive side, the region is recovering from a recession, which, although not&#13;
nearly as severe as that caused by the Tequila crisis in 1 995, hit many economies hard.&#13;
In the year 2000, the regional economy is expected to grow at around 3 percent, and the&#13;
unemployment rate is leveling off. A decade of reform and liberalization has made the&#13;
region's economy more resilient, providing the basis for a faster-than-expected recovery&#13;
and acceleration in growth. Moreover, increased activity in the private sector has raised&#13;

            International Finance Corporation (IFC)
            annual report 2000 : building business, creating opportunity
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This is the International Finance
            Corporation (IFC) annual report for FY2000, which outlines
            its increased gross approvals, led by a record of new
            investments in Sub-Saharan Africa; the realization of its
            second-highest-ever annual net income; and, the significant
            resurgence in commercial bank lending through its
            syndications program. However, during the period IFC also
            felt the push of reformers, and critics, and the effects of
            a changing market place. Responsive to changing needs, IFC
            looks at how to bridge the digital divide which threatens
            the developing world; at ways to strengthen domestic
            financial markets; at how to address basic infrastructure;
            and, at how to improve access to health care and education,
            as well as how to improve environmental, and social
            sustainability. IFC's single largest sectoral focus
            remains the financial sector, which amounted to 46 percent
            of new approvals, though strategic priorities were further
            refined to align its activities with market realities, by
            building business, and creating job opportunities. Moreover,
            it has pioneered corporate environmental and social
            responsibility, by moving the private sector to actively
            promote economic development. IFC activities during FY2000
            are presented, and, through case studies, shows the range of
            projects, by region and investment type. Finally, IFC's
            financial review describes performance, funding management,
            capital earnings, as well as risk management, and credit risk.
