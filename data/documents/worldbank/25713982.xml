Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;
under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement shall be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any&#13;
applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2   Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time,&#13;
including its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to&#13;
prevent and combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources&#13;
to finance terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of&#13;
the Security Council taken under Chapter VII of the of Charter of the United Nations. The Donors&#13;
acknowledge that this provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist&#13;
financing and asset control laws, regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual member country&#13;
that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be&#13;
kept separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be&#13;
commingled with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee, has&#13;

additional financing.&#13;

3.1    The Bank shall deduct and retain for its own account, as a deduction from each Installment, an&#13;

covered by the percentage deduction specified above as an administrative fee; and (ii) not included under&#13;
Annex 1 of the Administration Arrangements in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and&#13;

Fund's aggregate contributions from all donors, costs directly attributed to such activities in an amount&#13;
not to exceed zero point nine three percent (0.93%) of Donor contributions. This allocation reflects the&#13;
current requirements for enhanced supervision for the management and coordination of GEQIP, including&#13;
the Trust Fund. It may be amended, from time to time, in agreement with all Trust Fund Donors to address&#13;
any additional requirements for program supervision.&#13;
3.3    Each Donor acknowledges and agrees that the percentage deductions for fees in this Trust Fund&#13;
Fees and Costs section are estimated on the basis of anticipated Contributions. If actual Contributions&#13;
significantly differ from what was originally anticipated at the time of signature of the first Administration&#13;
Agreement, or if other circumstances affecting Trust Fund fees or costs change, the Bank reserves the right&#13;
to request a change to the terms of this Trust Fund Fees and Costs section, which would be effectuated by&#13;
amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all Donors and which would thereafter be&#13;

Administration Agreements or from new Donors under new Administration Agreements.&#13;

the Trust Fund and disbursements made therefrom.&#13;

of the Bank's applicable policies and procedures. All associated costs, including any costs incurred by the&#13;
