  This case study summarizes the responses to the questionnaire on The Nuts and Bolts of the Program Expanding&#13;
Health Coverage to the Poor, developed within the framework of the World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s UNICO â&#128;&#147; Universal Challenge&#13;
Program. The authors are grateful for the inputs provided by HÃ©ider AurÃ©lio Pinto, Allan Nuno Alves de Souza,&#13;
Dirceu Ditmar Klitzke, and other members of the Primary Care Department of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. We&#13;
would also like to acknowledge the contributions of Christopher Lovelace, Jack Langenbrunner, and Somil Nagpal,&#13;
who reviewed an early draft, and Charles Griffin and Magnus Lindelow, who served as peer reviewers of the final&#13;
version. The authors would also like to thank Daniel Cotlear for his leadership in steering this effort, which involved&#13;
more than 20 task team leaders across all regions of the World Bank; and Joana Godinho for the guidance and&#13;
support she provided to the nine case studies covering the Latin America and the Caribbean region.&#13;
&amp;#12;           The World Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Universal Health Coverage Studies Series (UNICO)&#13;
All people aspire to receive quality, affordable health care. In recent years, this aspiration has&#13;
spurred calls for universal health coverage (UHC) and has given birth to a global UHC&#13;
movement. In 2005, this movement led the World Health Assembly to call on governments to&#13;
â&#128;&#156;develop their health systems, so that all people have access to services and do not suffer&#13;
financial hardship paying for them.â&#128;? In December 2012, the movement prompted the United&#13;
Nations General Assembly to call on governments to â&#128;&#156;urgently and significantly scale-up efforts&#13;
to accelerate the transition towards universal access to affordable and quality healthcare&#13;
services.â&#128;? Today, some 30 middle-income countries are implementing programs that aim to&#13;
advance the transition to UHC, and many other low- and middle-income countries are&#13;
considering launching similar programs.&#13;
The World Bank supports the efforts of countries to share prosperity by transitioning toward&#13;
UHC with the objectives of improving health outcomes, reducing the financial risks associated&#13;
with ill health, and increasing equity. The Bank recognizes that there are many paths toward&#13;
UHC and does not endorse a particular path or set of organizational or financial arrangements to&#13;
reach it. Regardless of the path chosen, successful implementation requires that many&#13;
instruments and institutions be in place. While different paths can be taken to expand coverage,&#13;
all paths involve implementation challenges. With that in mind, the World Bank launched the&#13;
Universal Health Coverage Studies Series (UNICO Study Series) to develop knowledge and&#13;
operational tools designed to help countries tackle these implementation challenges in ways that&#13;
are fiscally sustainable and that enhance equity and efficiency. The UNICO Studies Series&#13;
consists of technical papers and country case studies that analyze different issues related to the&#13;
challenges of UHC policy implementation.&#13;
The case studies in the series are based on the use of a standardized protocol to analyze the nuts&#13;
and bolts of programs that have expanded coverage from the bottom upâ&#128;&#148;programs that have&#13;
started with the poor and vulnerable rather than those initiated in a trickle-down fashion. The&#13;
protocol consists of nine modules with over 300 questions that are designed to elicit a detailed&#13;
understanding of how countries are implementing five sets of policies to accomplish the&#13;
following: (a) manage the benefits package, (b) manage processes to include the poor and&#13;
vulnerable, (c) nudge efficiency reforms to the provision of care, (d) address new challenges in&#13;
primary care, and (e) tweak financing mechanisms to align the incentives of different&#13;
stakeholders in the health sector. To date, the nuts and bolts protocol has been used for two&#13;
purposes: to create a database comparing programs implemented in different countries, and to&#13;
produce case studies of programs in 24 developing countries and one high-income â&#128;&#156;comparator,â&#128;?&#13;
the state of Massachusetts in the United States. The protocol and case studies are being published&#13;
as part of the UNICO Studies Series, and a comparative analysis will be available in 2013.&#13;
We trust that the protocol, case studies, and technical papers will provide UHC implementers&#13;
with an expanded toolbox, make a contribution to discussions about UHC implementation, and&#13;
that they will inform the UHC movement as it continues to expand worldwide.&#13;

&amp;#12;Executive Summary&#13;
&#13;
Since the return to democracy in the 1980s, Brazil has embraced a development model that&#13;
promotes inclusive growth through substantial investments in social programs aimed at&#13;
alleviating poverty and improving the quality of life of poor families. This was achieved through&#13;
targeted social programs, such as the conditional cash transfer program, Bolsa FamÃ­lia, and&#13;
through broad reforms such as the overhauling of the health system and the creation of a tax-&#13;
financed national health system, the Unified Health System (Sistema Ã&#154;nico de SaÃºde, SUS). The&#13;
SUS embodies the principles laid out in the 1988 constitution that establishes universal and&#13;
egalitarian access to health care as a right of the citizen and an obligation of the state.&#13;
&#13;
The SUS unified the existing disparate contributory and public subsystems (Social Security, the&#13;
Ministry of Health, states and municipalities) into one coordinated national system to which the&#13;
entire population is entitled. It also invested heavily in primary care, fundamentally changing the&#13;
existing hospital-based curative care medical model. The Primary Care Strategy, principally&#13;
through its flagship programâ&#128;&#148;the Family Health Strategy (FHS), established multidisciplinary&#13;
teams of health professionals who are responsible for a defined territory and population with&#13;
whom they establish contact and share responsibility for health care. The family health teams are&#13;
the point of entry into the health system, including through home visits, and are responsible for&#13;
health promotion activities, as well as sectoral and intersectoral actions to control risk factors in&#13;
the community.&#13;
&#13;
The following important reforms where introduced through the FHS: (a) federal transfers to&#13;
municipalities to finance primary health were made on the basis of a per-capita fixed amount&#13;
plus a variable amount, which incentivized expansion of the program (for example, population&#13;
coverage, number of health teams); (b) explicit agreements were signed between the spheres of&#13;
government outlining roles and responsibilities, program indicators, and targets; (c) continuous&#13;
monitoring of performance indicators and increasingly greater transparency by making results&#13;
available to the public to promote accountability; and (d) municipalities that implement the&#13;
program were able to alleviate human-resource constraints by using contract workers,&#13;
circumventing budgetary restrictions to enlarge the civil servant payroll. Although the program&#13;
did not formally target the poor, its expansion prioritized extension of coverage and improved&#13;
access for low-income and vulnerable groups. By identifying at home and in the community&#13;
those in need of care who were not previously seeking services, it also de facto targeted this&#13;
vulnerable group.&#13;
&#13;
A number of studies point to the effectiveness of the FHS and its success in reaching the poor.&#13;
However, a few challenges remaining going forth. First, the program appears to have reached a&#13;
plateau, covering approximately 100 million people. The government is implementing programs&#13;
to strengthen horizontal and vertical integration across levels of the service delivery network, and&#13;
to improve the quality of primary care, which may resolve current shortcomings and eventually&#13;
lead to increased utilization of lower-level services. However, the role of publicly provided&#13;
primary care in some areasâ&#128;&#148;for instance, where the private sector covers over 30 percent of the&#13;
populationâ&#128;&#148;may need to be revisited. The issue of complementarity of the public and private&#13;
subsystems goes well beyond primary care and will need to be addressed from a broader&#13;
perspective. Other broad system issues that are unresolved and impact primary care are the lack&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   v&#13;
&amp;#12;of transparent processes for inclusion or exclusion of interventions provided under the SUS and&#13;
the use of contracted health professional, an issue that has come under increasing legal and&#13;
political scrutiny.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             vi&#13;
&amp;#12;1. Introduction&#13;
&#13;
The last two decades have been a period of healthy growth accompanied by marked&#13;
improvements in living standards in Brazil. While economic growth, which averaged 3.2 percent&#13;
per year during this period, may not have matched the pace of the 1960s and 1970s (when the&#13;
economy grew at an average annual rate of 6.6 percent), gains in many socioeconomic indicators&#13;
have been unprecedented (World Bank 2012). The proportion of the population living in extreme&#13;
poverty (US$1 a day) was reduced by nearly two-thirds from 17.2 percent in 1990 to 6.1 percent&#13;
in 2009; an even greater decline occurred in the under-five child mortality rate (from 58 deaths&#13;
per 1,000 live births to 16 deaths per 1,000 live births); the prevalence of underweight children&#13;
was halved (from 4.5 percent to 2.2 percent); and the proportion of the population without access&#13;
to improved drinking water sources declined by three-quarters, from 11 percent to less than 3&#13;
percent (United Nations 2012). After a period of stagnation, possibly due to improvements in&#13;
reporting, maternal mortality is once again on the decline. Life expectancy at birth was 73.5&#13;
years in 2010, which compares favorably with countries in its income group (see Annex 1).&#13;
&#13;
This progress has been achieved, in part, through development strategies focused on investments&#13;
in the social sectors, including during periods of austerity or financial crisis when key health and&#13;
education programs were protected from severe budget cuts. 2 These investments included&#13;
implementation of targeted social programs, such as the conditional cash transfer program, Bolsa&#13;
Familia, and broad overarching reforms such as those witnessed in the health sector. Since the&#13;
1988 constitution, which established access to health care as a citizen right and an obligation of&#13;
the state, this principle has been gradually translated into practice through a series of successive&#13;
reforms, starting with creation of the Unified Health System (Sistema Ã&#154;nico de SaÃºde, SUS), a&#13;
national health system financed by general taxes to which the entire population is entitled. The&#13;
Primary Care Strategy (PCS), which is the subject of this case study, has been a cornerstone of&#13;
the SUS.&#13;
&#13;
A number of assessments of the SUS have been carried out over the years. They generally point&#13;
to significant achievements in improving access and contributing to bringing Brazil from lagging&#13;
behind its peers in terms of health indicators to being a good performer. The studies also point to&#13;
shortcomings regarding persistent inefficiencies, particularly in hospital care, remaining gaps in&#13;
coverage, and fragmentation of the system (Gragnolati et al. 2012). There is a broad consensus,&#13;
however, that the PCS has been successful.&#13;
&#13;
This case study assesses the key features and the achievements and challenges of Brazilâ&#128;&#153;s PCS&#13;
and analyzes the contribution of this strategy to the establishment and implementation of&#13;
universal coverage. Section 2 provides context for the discussion by summarizing key reforms&#13;
and the impact of the PCS and describes Brazilâ&#128;&#153;s health care delivery and financing system. The&#13;
institutional architecture and interaction of the health care program (HCP), in this case the PCS,&#13;
is discussed in section 3. Sections 4 through 8 outline the main features of the strategy, including&#13;
the identification and targeting of beneficiaries, management of public funds, services covered,&#13;
and the information environment. The case study concludes with a discussion of lessons learned&#13;
(section 9) and the pending agenda (section 10).&#13;

    The Family Health Strategy and Community Health Program were among the protected programs.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  1&#13;
&amp;#12;2. Background on Health System Reforms&#13;
&#13;
Universal health coverage in Brazil is a feature borne out of the pursuit of democracy and social&#13;
rights. The political struggle to re-democratize Brazil was accompanied by a struggle to reclaim&#13;
social rights (to health, education, better living conditions, and a community voice), which had&#13;
been alienated or neglected under the military regime (1964â&#128;&#147;85). Universal coverage and&#13;
decentralization were flagship principles of the politically influential â&#128;&#156;public health movementâ&#128;?&#13;
and a central claim of many pro-democracy social movements (Faletti 2006).&#13;
&#13;
In the early 1980s, the public system was fragmented into several independent and parallel&#13;
subsystems (figure 1). The Instituto Nacional de AssistÃªncia MÃ©dica da PrevidÃªncia Social&#13;
(INAMPS) (the medical care arm of the Social Security Institute) was the main player, providing&#13;
coverage for curative services to employees of the largely urban formal sector, although efforts&#13;
were made to expand coverage, for example, to rural and domestic workers. The Ministry of&#13;
Health (MOH) focused on public health (mostly through national immunization â&#128;&#156;campaignsâ&#128;?)&#13;
and vertical disease programs that were not integrated with the service delivery system. The&#13;
MOH managed a few hospitals, concentrated in the formal capital Rio de Janeiro, while state&#13;
governments and larger municipalities operated their own facility networks, which were open to&#13;
everyone but catered mostly to the poor, who also relied on the services provided by a large&#13;
number of nonprofit institutions. The Ministry of Education ran a number of university hospitals,&#13;
which were managed as departments of the universities. This uncoordinated nonsystem left large&#13;
segments of the population uncovered, such as the unemployed and informal sector workers, and&#13;
resulted in important duplications and inefficiencies, namely a centralized medical model&#13;
focused on curative care that did not adequately respond to the needs of the population; cost&#13;
escalation due to the increasing complexity of the hospital-centered delivery system and payment&#13;
mechanisms to private providers on a fee-for-service basis; and redirection of resources to cover&#13;
deficits elsewhere in the social security system as well as other federal expenditures (CONASS&#13;
2011).&#13;
&#13;
Health reforms, which were started in the 1980s and ensconced in the 1988 constitution, were&#13;
aimed at addressing these shortcomings. The constitution, which defined health as a citizenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
right and an obligation of the state, created the Unified Health System (Sistema Ã&#154;nico de SaÃºde,&#13;
SUS), whose main objective and achievement was to unify these disparate subsystems into one&#13;
national health system to which the entire population is entitled, under MOH coordination. The&#13;
constitution, and subsequent amendments, municipalized health services, established social&#13;
control through community participation, and codified financial contributions for health at each&#13;
level of government (see Annex 2 for a graphic depiction of the decentralized national health&#13;
system). Today, nearly 70 percent of the Brazilian population uses either only or mainly the SUS&#13;
for health care (figure 1).&#13;

Primary care and public health had always been a major weakness of the Brazilian health system,&#13;
mostly characterized by a heavy bias toward curative and hospital, care as stated earlier. Starting&#13;
in the early 1990s and consolidated in the second half of the decade, a subsequent phase of&#13;
reforms reorganized and strengthened primary care through the Family Health Program&#13;
(Programa SaÃºde da FamÃ­lia, later renamed as the Family Health Strategy [FHS]) 3 and the&#13;
Community Health Agents Program (Programa de Agentes ComunitÃ¡rios de SaÃºde [PACS]),&#13;
including financing mechanisms to fund this reorganization. Public health activities and&#13;
programs were also significantly strengthened and improved: immunization coverage doubled, to&#13;
reach 98 percent in 2000; disease control and sanitary surveillance were greatly improved, the&#13;
latter through the creation in 1998 of a strong national agency, the National Health Surveillance&#13;
Agency (AgÃªncia Nacional de VigilÃ¢ncia SanitÃ¡ria). The success of the Brazilian strategy against&#13;
HIV/AIDS was based to a great extent on widely disseminated and effective media campaigns&#13;
(the other pillar being the early free distribution of antiretroviral therapy).&#13;
&#13;
In the current phase of reforms, starting in the 2000s, new regulations and guidelines were issued&#13;
that sought to strengthen care management through regionalization of the SUS to address&#13;
challenges in coordination across levels of care, a downside of decentralization of service&#13;
delivery, and to strengthen management, efficiency, and accountability through the establishment&#13;
of explicit management contracts and results-based payment mechanisms, specifying coverage&#13;
targets, among other performance indicators. 4&#13;
&#13;
While the â&#128;&#156;public health movementâ&#128;? strongly supported public financing and provision of health&#13;
care, there was the counterbalancing force of the private health sector lobby. The 1988&#13;
constitution, which foresees both public and private provision and financing, represents a&#13;
political compromise (Faletti et al.). The Brazilian system today remains pluralistic, with reliance&#13;
3&#13;
 For consistency, we will use only the current name, Family Health Strategy, throughout this document.&#13;
4&#13;
 Some management and payment models had been designed and implemented earlier at the state level, such as the&#13;
Social Organizations of SÃ£o Paulo, in the late 1990s.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                           3&#13;
&amp;#12;on SUS or private providers varying significantly depending on the type of service needed. It is&#13;
higher at the two extremes of the service spectrum: public health and preventive care, and&#13;
complex, expensive services.&#13;
&#13;
While technical questions regarding the interface between the subsectors were never explicitly&#13;
addressed, a review of implementation of the SUS, and particularly of the Primary Care Strategy,&#13;
reveal a pragmatic approach of prioritizing public resources to expand access to the lower-&#13;
income segments of the population. The scaling up of the FHS, a flagship program of the broader&#13;
PCS, illustrates how poor municipalities were given preference over wealthier ones (figure 2).&#13;

&#13;
Several studies point to the effectiveness of the FHS. Macinko et al. (2006) state that a 10&#13;
percent increase in coverage of the program was associated with a statistically significant 4.5&#13;
percent decrease in the infant mortality rate, controlling for other determinants. Rocha and&#13;
Soares (2010) show that the program had a positive impact on reducing mortality throughout the&#13;
age distribution, and was associated with reduced fertility, improved school enrolment, and&#13;
increased labor supply of adults. Macinko (2011) demonstrated that higher coverage rates of the&#13;
FHS were associated with a greater reduction in avoidable hospitalizations for a number of&#13;
important chronic diseases, although not diabetes or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease&#13;
(figure 3). 5 Further, Almeida et al. (2012) document a decrease in inequality and inequity in&#13;
health care utilization since implementation of the SUS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

 A figure lower than 1 represents a reduction in primary care sensitive hospitalizations. The increase in diabetes&#13;
hospitalization could be attributable to better detection rates in areas with high program coverage.&#13;

&#13;
It is the success of the FHS in reaching the poor, and its overall effectiveness, that makes it of&#13;
interest to other countries implementing universal coverage policies and, hence, the subject of&#13;
this case study. It is, however, important to understand the program as part of the broader system.&#13;
The next section provides this context.&#13;
&#13;
3. Health Care Delivery and Financing&#13;
&#13;
Brazil has a mixed health system, with a broad variety of financing and provision arrangements.&#13;
Supply of health services is split into three main subsystems:&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢   A publicly financed and provided subsystem, which accounts for 65 percent of medical&#13;
        consultations and 35 percent of inpatient care&#13;
    â&#128;¢   A publicly financed but privately provided subsystem, which account for 10 percent of&#13;
        medical consultations and 27 percent of inpatient care&#13;
    â&#128;¢   A privately financed and provided subsystem, which accounts for 25 percent of medical&#13;
        consultations 6 and 38 percent of inpatient care; most of these services are funded through&#13;
        private insurance schemes.&#13;
&#13;
Primary care and public health services are mostly the responsibility of the public systemâ&#128;&#148;the&#13;
Unified Health System (SUS), although a significant number of nonspecialized outpatient care&#13;
visits are provided by the private sector (though it is not, strictly speaking, organized as primary&#13;
health care). Following the decentralization of health care provision under SUS, most primary&#13;
care (84 percent) is now provided by municipal governments. Some primary care services are&#13;
6&#13;
  Private ambulatory care does not include medical consultations provided under solo practice, for which no&#13;
information is available.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                      5&#13;
&amp;#12;insufficiently supplied by the SUS; as much as 70 percent of dental care, for instance, is privately&#13;
financed.&#13;
&#13;
Specialist care and diagnostic services, though covered under the SUS, are services for which&#13;
the population relies heavily on the private sector. This is in part due to availability, which is&#13;
concentrated in larger municipalities and urban centers, particularly for highly specialized care.&#13;
Tapping into the delivery capacity available in the private sector is constrained by the SUS&#13;
payment schedule, which is considered insufficient. Weak gatekeeping and poor referral and&#13;
counterreferral systems contribute to ineffective access to public services, with some patients not&#13;
able to meet their medical needs while others, who do not have a medical indication, avail&#13;
themselves of the services.&#13;
&#13;
General hospital care is mostly supplied by the private sector, under contract with SUS (51&#13;
percent of hospital beds and 27 percent of inpatient admissions) or under private financing (14&#13;
percent of beds and 38 percent of admissions). The public sector accounts for 35 percent of beds&#13;
and admissions. 7 Under the SUS, secondary care is usually the responsibility of state&#13;
governments and larger municipalities; the MOH and the Ministry of Education retain about 100&#13;
large referral and teaching hospitals.&#13;
&#13;
At the other end of the service spectrum, expensive and complex tertiary care is provided&#13;
mainly by the SUS, with a few private hospitals (mostly under private financing) also providing&#13;
tertiary-level services. The SUS is almost the sole provider of services such as organ transplants&#13;
and HIV/AIDS treatment. However, tertiary-level diagnostic services are provided mostly by&#13;
private providers and public teaching hospitals.&#13;
&#13;
A good example of SUS presence in the high-end scope of services is InCor (the Heart Institute&#13;
in SÃ£o Paulo), the most renowned cardiac surgery hospital in the country. InCor is owned and&#13;
operated by the state government of SÃ£o Paulo as part of the large Hospital das ClÃ­nicas&#13;
complex, formerly attached to the Medical School of the University of SÃ£o Paulo. It is funded&#13;
from the state governmentâ&#128;&#153;s budget; SUS federal transfers; and supplementary income from&#13;
private patients, research grants, and donations. This diversification of funding sources was made&#13;
possible by the creation of a supporting foundation (the Zerbini Foundation), which allowed for&#13;
significant autonomy in revenue raising and resource allocation and was instrumental in ensuring&#13;
excellence and financial sustainability of the hospital.&#13;
&#13;
The structure of health care delivery and financing in Brazil must be understood in the context of&#13;
decentralization, which started with the democratization process of the 1980s, was consolidated&#13;
in the 1988 constitution, and was further refined through administrative rules issued in the early&#13;
1990s. The municipalization of the public health system in this period is apparent (figure 4);&#13;
while the federal and state network shrank, the municipal network quadrupled between 1989 and&#13;
2005, outstripping the rate of growth of the private sector (Mori Sarti et al. 2012). Although most&#13;
of the country and its population is now within reach of a public health facility, access problems&#13;
remain in some remote areas, especially in the Amazon region and remote rural areas. Overall,&#13;
only 5 percent of the population report not being able to obtain the care they needed (IBGE,&#13;
&#13;
7&#13;
  It would be erroneous to make efficiency inferences about public or private hospitals, either publicly or privately&#13;
funded, based on these figures due to differences in case mix, among other factors.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                   6&#13;
&amp;#12;PNAD 2008), and fewer still report physical and geographic access obstacles as the main&#13;
reason. 8&#13;

&#13;
Over the same period, investments in new infrastructure have favored the ambulatory care&#13;
network, leaving the overall number of hospitals unchanged. This has led to a decline in density&#13;
of hospitals and hospital beds relative to ambulatory facilities (Gragnolati et al. 2012). These&#13;
changes are not accidental. They reflect a move away from the existing hospital-centric, curative&#13;
care model toward one that promotes the use of primary care. Also, since the early 1980s, the&#13;
contribution of the publicly financed but privately provided subsystem has decreased steadily in&#13;
favor of public finance and provision. Nonetheless, the private sector remains an important&#13;
player both within the SUS (mostly in its not-for-profit modality) and in the privately funded&#13;
subsector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

  Several recent programs have focused on bridging this gap, including the Health in Frontier Areas and Health in&#13;
Indigenous Areas programs, and a World Bank-supported project to set up health care networks in the Western part&#13;
of the Amazon region.&#13;

The financing pattern of the Brazilian health sector is rather complex, because of the multiple&#13;
financing and provision arrangements in place. In spite of its size, the SUS accounts for less than&#13;
50 percent of total health expenditure in Brazil; private insurance represents about 24 percent and&#13;
household out-of-pocket expenditure 31 percent (figure 6). The SUS is fully and jointly funded&#13;
by taxes from the three levels of government, through constitutionally defined contributions for&#13;
health from the federal (6 to 7 percent of gross revenues), and state and municipal governments&#13;
(12 and 15 percent of net revenues, respectively). The federal government is the largest funder of&#13;
SUS, but its contribution has been declining since the early 1980s, from around 70 percent to less&#13;
than 50 percent in recent years (figure 7). It finances a few large referral hospitals directly owned&#13;
by the MOH (in addition to 45 teaching hospitals belonging to the Ministry of Education), and&#13;
cofinances primary and secondary care through transfers to state and municipal governments. 9&#13;
The share of the federal budget spent on subnational transfers has increased dramatically, from&#13;
less than 8 percent in 1995 to nearly 60 percent today (split 40/60 between state and municipal&#13;
transfers). States and municipalities contribute similar shares to financing the SUS, around 27 to&#13;
28 percent each. Given this joint funding responsibility, financial flows acquire additional&#13;
complexity to ensure that mostâ&#128;&#148;if not allâ&#128;&#148;activities and programs are cofunded by all three&#13;
levels of government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
9&#13;
 Direct payments to private providers, once a major part of the MOH budget, are now mostly financed by state and&#13;
municipal governments, out of their own budget and federal transfers.&#13;

Total health expenditures in Brazil today amount to approximately 8.8 percent of gross domestic&#13;
product (GDP). This share has been increasing over time, driven by the rise in public&#13;
expenditures and spending on private insurance. While out-of-pocket payments for health overall&#13;

&amp;#12;have not changed substantially during this period, it is notable that the burden on households in&#13;
the lower end of the income distribution have been significantly reduced (figure 8). Only 2.2&#13;
percent of households in Brazil incur catastrophic health expenditures (at the 30 percent&#13;
threshold), which is lower than all but one of the 12 Latin American and Caribbean countries&#13;
analyzed by Knaul et al. (2012).&#13;

4. Institutional Architecture and Interaction of HCP with the Rest of the Health System&#13;
&#13;
Beginning in the early 1990s and strengthened after 1994, a new strategy for reorganizing&#13;
primary care centered on a family health approach, and outreach activities were gradually but&#13;
swiftly deployed. This strategy was based on four main integrated components:&#13;
&#13;
                            â&#128;¢     The deployment of a new, outreach-based approach to primary care, through the&#13;
                                  Community Health Agents Program (PACS) from 1991â&#128;&#148;which was rapidly expanded&#13;
                                  from the pilot areas in the Northeast to the rest of the country (reaching 100 million&#13;
                                  people or 53 percent of the population by 2009)â&#128;&#148;and, starting in 1994, of the FHS.&#13;
                            â&#128;¢     The adoption of innovative payment mechanisms to finance primary care, partially linked&#13;
                                  to coverage targets and other performance indicators. These new provider payment&#13;
                                  mechanisms provided strong incentives for state and municipal governments to rapidly&#13;
                                  expand primary care services.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                                                      10&#13;
&amp;#12;     â&#128;¢   The definition of a comprehensive package of services, including the provision of&#13;
         essential drugs through the Basic Drugs Program (FarmÃ¡cia BÃ¡sica) and the more recent&#13;
         Popular Pharmacy Program (FarmÃ¡cia Popular, which requires copayment), and dental&#13;
         care.&#13;
     â&#128;¢   Specific programs focusing on particularly vulnerable populations, such as indigenous&#13;
         groups, at-risk youth, and inmates.&#13;
&#13;
The SUS invested heavily in the expansion of the network of public facilities as part of the&#13;
strategy for extending access to primary care (see the previous section).&#13;
&#13;
The PCS is grounded on the SUSâ&#128;&#153;s principles of universality, integrality, equity, and social&#13;
participation, and implemented in the context of decentralization; that is, responsibility for its&#13;
execution is shared among the three spheres of government. The key features of the PCS, and&#13;
particularly of the FHS that is at its center, are (a) delineation of a defined territory for&#13;
programmatic and planning purposes and for the development of sectoral and intersectoral&#13;
actions that impact risk factors and health determinants at the community level; (b) designation&#13;
of family health teams as the preferred point of entry into the health system, responsible for&#13;
resolving the bulk of health care needs or following the patient as he or she is referred to higher&#13;
levels of care; (c) delineation of the population with whom the family health team is to establish&#13;
direct contact, creating a co-responsibility between health professionals, individual users, and the&#13;
community for health care; (d) organization based on multiprofessional and interdisciplinary&#13;
family health teams charged with delivering patient-centered care, under integrated management,&#13;
coordinating health care, health promotion, public health, and surveillance activities; and (e)&#13;
family health teams responsible for promoting user and community participation in resolving&#13;
health problems and in shaping health services that are responsive to their needs (Administrative&#13;
Rule NÂ° 2.488/October 21, 2011).&#13;
&#13;
The PCS has a much broader objective than coverage or access expansion. It is a fundamental&#13;
change in the delivery model away from the curative-, disease-, and procedure-centered&#13;
approach, segmented across vertical programs, health professions, and specialties, that passively&#13;
relied on patients to come to the facility, to one that actively seeks the population in need of care,&#13;
through community outreach and home visits. It aimed at identifying and treating common&#13;
diseases affecting the population, identifying and managing health risks, monitoring health&#13;
status, and providing timely preventive or curative care and expanding access to essential&#13;
services.&#13;
&#13;
The centerpiece of the strategy is the FHS, which became the key program to reorganize and&#13;
strengthen primary care. It is based on multiprofessional family health teams of usually six to 10&#13;
professionals (a family health physician or generalist, a nurse, nursing assistant, four to six&#13;
community health workers, 10 and in some cases dentist health professionals) operating from a&#13;
health center or family health center but providing mostly outreach activities through regular&#13;
home visits to every family in the teamâ&#128;&#153;s coverage area. Family health teams are responsible for&#13;
providing first contact, comprehensive, and whole-person care coordinated with other health&#13;
services. Each team is assigned around 1,000 households (or up to 4,000 people, with the&#13;
&#13;
10&#13;
  The number of community health workers varies depending on the size and needs of the population or territory&#13;
but cannot exceed 12 per family health team. Each community health worker is responsible for at most 750 people.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                             11&#13;
&amp;#12;recommended average being 3,000 per team) 11 within a given geographic area, and should&#13;
register every family in the area; assess and monitor living conditions, health risks, and health&#13;
status; and provide first-level preventive and curative care. Upon the need for additional health&#13;
services, the team interacts with other health professionals at the facility or refers the patient to&#13;
higher-level services.&#13;
&#13;
Another fundamental change brought about by the reform to the primary care system was the&#13;
manner in which the program was financed. Regulations enacted in 1996 replaced the fee-based&#13;
schedule for federal reimbursement of primary care interventions delivered by states and&#13;
municipalities with a capitation system (the Piso da AtenÃ§Ã£o BÃ¡sica fixo [fixed PAB]) and an&#13;
incentive-based payment (the variable PAB) to promote implementation of priority programs&#13;
such as the FHS and PACS among othersâ&#128;&#148;although these two programs account for the lionâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
share of resources. This explains the rapid expansion of the FHS, particularly since 1999 when&#13;
new norms established that the variable PAB amount would be based on the FHSâ&#128;&#153;s population&#13;
coverage (figure 9). Expansion was also facilitated by the fact that family health teams could be&#13;
hired under contract, alleviating the human resources bottleneck that would have existed had&#13;
municipalities been constrained to hiring civil servants. 12 Importantly, it also allowed the MOH&#13;
to maintain stewardship over a highly decentralized system. Section 6 discusses management&#13;
arrangements in greater detail.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
The PCS also had an impact on the way the overall health system operates. By changing the way&#13;
primary care is organized and provided, and substantially shifting the country away from the&#13;
11&#13;
   The number of individuals covered per FHS team is left to the discretion of the municipality, but the PCS&#13;
recommends that vulnerability of the population be used as a criterion, with teams having responsibility for fewer&#13;
people where their degree of vulnerability is greater.&#13;
12&#13;
   This was particularly true in the late 1990s, when Brazil was undergoing a period of increased fiscal austerity,&#13;
including contraction to recurrent public spending, in an effort to stabilize macroeconomic indicators (the Plano&#13;
Real).&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                12&#13;
&amp;#12;curative, hospital-centric approach to care previously prevalent in Brazil, the PCS had&#13;
repercussions elsewhere in the system (for example, the reduction in density of hospitals and&#13;
hospital beds discussed in the previous section). However, its impact on the higher levels of care&#13;
has been limited by the weak integration between the FHS and secondary and tertiary services.&#13;
&#13;
In spite of progress over the last decade in reorganizing and strengthening primary care&#13;
provision, coordination of care still represents an important weakness of both the SUS and the&#13;
private sector. The SUS has put in place several mechanisms to ensure health planning&#13;
coordination, but efforts to promote care coordination itself are recent and of limited&#13;
effectiveness thus far. Health committees and councils have been formed at all levels of the&#13;
system; regional or local bed and referral management units (Centrais de RegulaÃ§Ã£o) have been&#13;
established, and referral guidelines are in place. But these regulations are not very effective or&#13;
enforcedâ&#128;&#148;though there is variation across the country, with some states making considerable&#13;
progress (for example, SÃ£o Paulo and Santa Catarina). There is no gatekeeping mechanism,&#13;
although FHS is supposed to play that role. Moreover, with few exceptions, (for instance, in&#13;
Minas Gerais, Curitiba, AracajÃº), effective, integrated health care networks are not in place. In&#13;
December 2010, the MOH launched a policy to address existing weaknesses and establish&#13;
horizontally and vertically integrated regional networks, with primary care at its center. Progress,&#13;
however, has been slow in view of the complexity of the task.&#13;
&#13;
5. Targeting, Identification, and Enrolment of Beneficiaries&#13;
&#13;
The goal of expanding and improving coverage to the poor was a key element of the 1980s&#13;
reforms leading to the establishment universal coverage and the SUS in the 1988 constitution.&#13;
The broader political aim was to reduce inequalities and ensure the universal right to health.&#13;
Differently from many other developing countries, coverage expansion was built as a&#13;
fundamental objective into the main public health system rather than the focus of separate&#13;
programs. However, several programs have been instrumental in extending or improving access&#13;
to essential services: the FHS and the more recent Popular Pharmacy Program.&#13;
&#13;
The SUS does have several programs focusing on or prioritizing the poor or vulnerable,&#13;
including the Program for Health in Frontier Areas and the Program for Health of Indigenous&#13;
Peoples. In these cases and others, the poor are targeted by focusing on specific, previously&#13;
underserved, geographic areas with a high level of poverty. The same is true for the PCS (and its&#13;
FHS component); this is a national, nontargeted program that has prioritized the poor by&#13;
focusing on expanding first in rural and poor urban areas of the Northeast and Northern regions,&#13;
where most of the population is low income (see figure 2, above). But there is no intention of or&#13;
mechanism for discriminating among users based on income or other criteria; primary care is a&#13;
universal program accessible to everyone irrespective of income or socioeconomic status. As&#13;
will be discussed in greater detail in the next section, federal transfers to finance primary care did&#13;
take into account the level of vulnerability of municipalities.&#13;
&#13;
Studies have provided substantial evidence of the propoor focus of FHS (Macinko 2011). FHS&#13;
was also deployed in middle-income neighborhoods of urban areas (although these have not been&#13;
prioritized). Another way in which the FHS indirectly targets the poor is through its actions at&#13;
the community and household level by identifying medically at-risk individuals who were not&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   13&#13;
&amp;#12;previously seeking care, and who are more likely to be poor, and bringing them into the care&#13;
network. Prioritizing the poor may also happen indirectly, by self-selection: higher-income&#13;
families are unlikely to use the program because they may not want to be identified as poor or&#13;
â&#128;&#156;SUS users.â&#128;?&#13;
&#13;
There are, however, a number of social programs in Brazil, some with health components, such&#13;
as the Bolsa FamÃ­lia, that do directly target the poor. At the end of the 1990s, the Brazilian&#13;
government began to give financial transfers to low-income families, conditional on children&#13;
attending school. This original school grant (Bolsa Escola), together with other focused grants&#13;
(for cooking gas, for example), were later merged into the well-known Bolsa FamÃ­lia, which was&#13;
greatly expanded to the point of covering about 13 million families (40 million individuals). The&#13;
benefit goes to families earning less than R$140.00 (US$80) per capita per month. Cash transfers&#13;
are conditional on utilization of defined health, education, and social services. The program has&#13;
been regarded as very successful in reducing poverty, having managed or contributed to raising&#13;
millions of people out of poverty.&#13;
&#13;
Linked to Bolsa FamÃ­lia, a national registry of low-income families (those with a total income&#13;
below three minimum wages or per capita income below one-half the minimum wage),&#13;
CadÃ&#154;nico has been developed and is used by the federal and subnational governments for&#13;
targeting social programs. It is the only national register of poor families, and is used for&#13;
determining and monitoring cash transfers within Bolsa FamÃ­lia, and targeting of other social&#13;
programs (for example, the low-income housing program Minha Casa Minha Vida).&#13;
&#13;
Although Bolsa FamÃ­lia has specific conditionalities linked to health, there is no formal linkage&#13;
between that program and health care provision within the SUS, and no evidence that this system&#13;
has been used for targeting health services to the poor. Poor families are identified in the MOH&#13;
information system only within the scope of the health services that are a conditionality for cash&#13;
transfers under Bolsa Familia (vaccination of children under age 7, growth-monitoring visits,&#13;
pre- and postnatal visits, well-baby visits, and breastfeeding and nutrition educational activities).&#13;
Outside of this narrow scope, the MOH does not use the CadÃ&#154;nico, and its own information&#13;
systems do not identify individuals by income level. In particular, PCS (including FHS) does not&#13;
use the existing CadÃ&#154;nico for identifying the poor, nor does it target poor households directly.&#13;
As will be explained below, a change was introduce in 2012; the percentage of the population in&#13;
the municipality that are beneficiaries of Bolsa Familia or are extremely poor, whichever is&#13;
lowest, is now used as a criterion to determine the size of the fixed PAB, with poor&#13;
municipalities receiving a larger per capita transfer.&#13;
&#13;
Identification of low-income or vulnerable families can be done in two ways in Brazil. Regular&#13;
household surveys conducted by the Brazilian Institute for Statistics and Geography (IBGE)&#13;
allow characterization and general identification of low-income families. These surveys include&#13;
Pesquisa Nacional por Amostra de DomicÃ­lio (PNAD), a yearly national survey of&#13;
socioeconomic conditions, employment, and income of Brazilian households; and Pesquisa de&#13;
OrÃ§amento Familiar (POF), a household budget survey conducted every four to five years.&#13;
However, these surveys are not used to identify the poor individually. Insofar as they are used by&#13;
IBGE to identify the extremely poor and the municipalityâ&#128;&#153;s per capita income, they do enter into&#13;
the calculation of the fixed PAB as of 2012.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                  14&#13;
&amp;#12;6. Special Topics Related to the Management of Public Funds in the HCP&#13;
&#13;
Since 2002, SUS expenditure has increased significantly, both in constant value and in&#13;
proportion of GDP, which grew from 3.2 percent in 2002 to over 4 percent in 2010 (figure 10).&#13;
As a proportion of total government spending, however, SUS spending has oscillated without a&#13;
clear trend, mostly because total government expenditure has also grown rapidly over the period.&#13;
This steady and sustained increase in public expenditure on health since 2002 represents a&#13;
significant change from the 1990s, when SUS spending oscillated widely following economic&#13;
cycles, but increased little in real terms. 13&#13;

&#13;
This recent increase in the SUS is reflected in the funding of most of its programs; primary care&#13;
benefited especially, since its prioritization is reflected in a larger proportion of public budgets&#13;
allocated to it (table 1). As a proportion of GDP, PCS spending increased over 50 percent, to&#13;
nearly 1.5 percent.&#13;

&#13;
Similarly to the SUS as a whole, PCS is cofunded by the federal, state, and municipal&#13;
governments (table 2). Municipalities are the main financial contributors and are responsible for&#13;
its execution. The MOH contributes about one-quarterâ&#128;&#148;much more in the case of FHS&#13;
specificallyâ&#128;&#148;through federal transfers to municipal and state governments. The World Bank has&#13;
supported the FHS, but the amount provided was small compared to the programâ&#128;&#153;s total&#13;
expenditure. For nearly all SUS programs, there are no copayments or financial contributions&#13;
from patients or users. 14&#13;

     Note: a. Included in central government.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Most federal funding for the PCS is in the form of transfers to states and municipalities; state&#13;
governments also make substantial transfers to municipalities to finance FHS. Federal transfers&#13;
include two broad components: a fixed per capita amount (the fixed PAB) and a variable part&#13;
(variable PAB) linked to achieving program targets agreed in the intergovernmental Agreement&#13;
on Primary Care (Pacto de AtenÃ§Ã£o BÃ¡sica), including population coverage of the FHS. Today,&#13;
the variable PAB is based on the number of FHS teams implemented in each municipality or&#13;
state.&#13;
&#13;
In 2012, the variable PAB, which is the largest share of federal transfers to municipalities, was&#13;
set at approximately US$3,500 to US$5,400 per family health team per month for 12 months,&#13;
&#13;
14&#13;
  The only exception so far is the Popular Pharmacy Program, where copayments are an integral feature of the&#13;
program.&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                          16&#13;
&amp;#12;US$1,100 to US$1,500 per dental health team per month for 12 months, and US$430 per&#13;
community health worker per month for 13 installments. Whether a municipality receives the&#13;
higher or lower amount depends on its size and level of vulnerability, which is determined by its&#13;
score on the Human Development Index; more vulnerable municipalities receive the larger sum.&#13;
The fixed PAB was between US$9.00 and US$11.50 per capita per year in 2012. An important&#13;
change was introduced that year: the amount transferred was set at four different levels. The per&#13;
capita amount a municipality receives now depends on its composite score on four measures: (a)&#13;
per capita income (normalized on a scale from 0 to 10, with higher income corresponding to a&#13;
higher score), (b) share of population that is not a Bolsa FamÃ­lia beneficiary or is not classified as&#13;
extreme poverty (whichever is lowest), (c) percentage of the population with private insurance&#13;
coverage, and (d) population density (normalized similarly to income per capita). Higher scores&#13;
translate into a lower per capita fixed PAB. The inclusion of private insurance coverage as a&#13;
criterion is particularly interesting; it could be interpreted as recognition of the complementarity&#13;
of the public and private subsystems.&#13;
&#13;
The PAB is transferred from the National Health Fund to the Municipal Health Fund (see Annex&#13;
2). Before the variable PAB can be transferred, municipalities must develop a proposal for&#13;
implementation or expansion of the FHS, which has to be approved by the Municipal Health&#13;
Council (which includes representatives from civil society) and the State Health Secretary, and&#13;
evaluated by the Bipartite Management Committee prior to being validated by the Ministry of&#13;
Health. Municipalities must also register the family health teams and populate the health&#13;
management and information system with data. Failure to do so can lead to suspension of&#13;
transfers. Fund utilization must also comply with federal and state public financial management&#13;
rules.&#13;
&#13;
A number of issues have been generating tension between the SUS and the economic ministries&#13;
(Planning and Finance) regarding financing of the public system as a whole, although not&#13;
specifically of the PCS. The first issue has been simmering for a long timeâ&#128;&#148;since before 1988â&#128;&#148;&#13;
and relates to the necessary funding for the health system. SUS authorities and supporters&#13;
consistently point to the insufficiency of funds as the main source of the systemâ&#128;&#153;s limitations and&#13;
difficulties. Several initiatives have been undertaken to significantly expand SUSâ&#128;&#153;s financing&#13;
base. During the 1980s, the SUS attempted to earmark 30 percent of the Social Security budget&#13;
to finance health; this proposal was never passed into law. In the mid-1990s, a new federal tax on&#13;
financial transactions, the ContribuiÃ§Ã£o ProvisÃ³ria sobre MovimentaÃ§Ã£o ou TransmissÃ£o de&#13;
Valores e de CrÃ©ditos e Direitos de Natureza Financeira (CPMF), was created to finance the&#13;
SUS; however, it was never fully allocated to health and was partly negated by a decrease in&#13;
other sources. In 2000, a constitutional amendment (Imenda Constitutional 29) was passed&#13;
requiring state and municipal governments to spend a minimum 12 percent and 15 percent,&#13;
respectively, of their budget on health. Though the amendment was only regulated by norms that&#13;
defined what could be counted as health expenditures in 2011, it managed to induce a significant&#13;
increase in subnational funding (which was, however, partly counteracted by a reduction in&#13;
federal funding). Over the last year, debate has raged in congress on the institution of a new tax&#13;
to finance health, but the tax was ultimately not approved.&#13;
&#13;
Economic authorities are reluctant to support new taxes for health or to increase allocation to&#13;
health, partly because SUS has an image of being inefficient and wasteful, and health authorities&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                   17&#13;
&amp;#12;find it difficult to make a strong case for increased funding. As a consequence, economic&#13;
authorities have been pushing for the development of payment mechanisms and governance&#13;
arrangements that would improve the incentives for greater efficiency in the health system and&#13;
link funding to some evidence of performance and impact. This has been resisted by a significant&#13;
portion of SUS authorities and supporters, which often see these initiatives and models as&#13;
privatization in disguise, and thus contrary to what they see as SUS fundamental values. And in&#13;
something of a reversal of positions, health authorities and managers are arguing for greater&#13;
flexibility in budget allocation and management, while the Finance Ministry insists on enforcing&#13;
current budgetary systems and controls. Ensuring value for money in public spending and greater&#13;
accountability to the public across all sectors has been a priority of the current administration,&#13;
and one that is likely to influence the direction of this debate.&#13;
&#13;
7. Management of the HCPâ&#128;&#153;s Benefits Package&#13;
&#13;
The PCS provides a comprehensive list of primary care services that are defined based on health&#13;
conditions (for example, hypertension or deliveries), clinical and nonclinical procedures (for&#13;
example, immunizations, home visits, health education, nursing care), and target groups (for&#13;
example, mothers, children, the elderly) (table 3). The list of services provided has evolved over&#13;
time, with the recent inclusion of treatment and control of hypertension and diabetes. It is&#13;
defined by the MOH, state and municipal health secretariats, and the National Council of State&#13;
Health Secretaries (Conselho Nacional de SecretÃ¡rios de SaÃºde), based on nonexplicit criteria&#13;
loosely related to cost-effectiveness and health benefits (though no systematic cost-effectiveness&#13;
assessment is performed). In the case of FHS, the initial cost of the services was estimated at the&#13;
time when the program was launched, though the methodological approach used was unclear.&#13;
This cost has not been systematically updated since, although limited costing studies have been&#13;
undertaken. For primary care as a whole, no costing studies have been undertaken.&#13;
&#13;
No maximum expenditure ceiling is specified for any SUS program, except for a ceiling in the&#13;
number of hospitalizations per state. However, contracts with hospitals are increasingly being&#13;
based on target indicators and/or global budgets, although these still apply to a minority of SUS&#13;
providers (social organizations in SÃ£o Paulo, teaching hospitals, nonprofit hospitals). Except for&#13;
the social organizations, in most cases financial ceilings are not rigorously enforced and bailouts&#13;
of private nonprofit hospitals have been common. No explicit cost-containment approaches are&#13;
used for the PCS, apart from the availability of funds. As primary health care and FHS grew,&#13;
funding also expanded and, therefore, did not represent a major restriction. An important&#13;
restriction, however, was imposed by the Fiscal Responsibility Law, passed in 2000, which&#13;
regulated the proportion of the budget that could be spent on personnel. As noted earlier, the&#13;
hiring of contracted employees allowed municipalities to circumvent this constraint to the&#13;
expansion of the FHS.&#13;

8. The Information Environment of the HCP&#13;
&#13;
In general, SUSâ&#128;&#153;s existing information systems are organized by level of care. The Sistema de&#13;
InformaÃ§Ã£o da AtenÃ§Ã£o BÃ¡sica (SIAB) collects information on FHS enrollee health status and&#13;
use of primary care services, using indicators for specific services and diseases (for example,&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                                    19&#13;
&amp;#12;maternal and child care, tuberculosis, hypertension, diabetes, and some heart diseases). Separate&#13;
systems record use of inpatient services (Sistema de InformaÃ§Ãµes Hospitalares, SIH) and&#13;
specialized ambulatory and diagnostic services (Sistema de InformaÃ§Ãµes Ambulatoriais, SIA).&#13;
However, these systems are not connected and do not allow tracking of patients across facilities&#13;
or services. Nor does the SIAB record use of hospital or referral services, except when the FHS&#13;
teams specifically refer patients to higher levels. SIAB is also used for monitoring achievement&#13;
of program and coverage targets negotiated and agreed between the three levels of government.&#13;
These targets are outlined in the Agreement on Primary Care, the Agreement for Health (Pacto&#13;
pela SaÃºde), and other annual or multiyear plans. Both SIAB and the pactos define and monitor&#13;
outcome indicators including, for example, infant mortality, hospitalization rates for stroke and&#13;
diabetes, cure rate for tuberculosis and Hansenâ&#128;&#153;s disease, and AIDS incidence among children&#13;
under five. Data from these information systems are publicly available on the MOH website.&#13;
&#13;
The many separate information systems in Brazil reflect a high level of fragmentation in health&#13;
care itself. They are not linked and do not allow for a comprehensive view or tracking of&#13;
individual patients or population groups across levels and types of services. The SUS card, under&#13;
implementation, is supposed to resolve the problem by recording every use of SUS facilities or&#13;
services; however, implementation of the card has been lagging, is limited to certain areas or&#13;
municipalities and, thus far, it is not clear to what extent it has helped reduce fragmentation in&#13;
services and information systems.&#13;
&#13;
SUS has over the years built mechanisms to ensure transparency. SIAB and overall FHS&#13;
information is made publicly available through the MOH and health secretariats websites, and&#13;
used for social marketing and information campaigns through leaflets and other public&#13;
documents. The MOH website presents and describes several of its programs, including FHS, for&#13;
public viewing and use. Most SIAB information is available through online databases, reports&#13;
and documents, and transparency laws require governments to publicize information. Additional&#13;
information requests to institutions or departments responsible for particular data are usually&#13;
answered in a timely fashion. In addition, â&#128;&#156;transparency portalsâ&#128;? have been set up in several&#13;
ministries and subnational secretariats; however, they are usually of little use, and most&#13;
information is best available from data portals. More recently, SUS has started scoring&#13;
municipalities according to a performance index, the Ã?ndice de Desempenho do SUS (IDSUS),&#13;
which measures access and quality of services in primary care, specialized ambulatory care and&#13;
hospital care, urgency, and emergency. Indicators include coverage of the FHS, and several&#13;
primary care service indicators such as proportion of newborns with mothers who had seven or&#13;
more prenatal visits, uterine cancer screening, and cure rates for new tuberculosis cases. The&#13;
index, which will be published every three years, is widely available and is a tool to promote&#13;
greater transparency. The FHS plans to eventually publish performance indicators per family&#13;
health team.&#13;
&#13;
9. Lessons from a Two-pronged Approach to Universal Coverage&#13;
&#13;
The Brazilian Unified Health System was created in the wake of a re-democratization process to&#13;
resolve three central limitations of the health system in the early 1980s, characterized by&#13;
fragmentation (several parallel and uncoordinated systems), focus on personal curative care, and&#13;
large inequalities in coverage and access to care. Twenty years after its establishment in the 1988&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                20&#13;
&amp;#12;constitution, the health system is quite different from its predecessor and much improved in its&#13;
three main goals. The SUS consolidated all the existing parallel public systems (MOH, Social&#13;
Security, states, and municipalities) into one coordinated system.&#13;
&#13;
The SUS has managed to balance, though still imperfectly, the decentralized federal structure of&#13;
the country with the need for system coordination and national policies and priorities through a&#13;
complex but functional system of intergovernmental negotiation, planning, and financing. It has&#13;
significantly reorganized and strengthened primary care, thus reversingâ&#128;&#148;although not fullyâ&#128;&#148;the&#13;
long-term curative bias of the Brazilian health system through a consistent set of coordinated&#13;
programs and innovative payment mechanisms centered on the successful FHS. Finally, it has&#13;
significantly reduced existing inequalities in access and health status, in a country known for its&#13;
historically high level of socioeconomic inequities. As a result of this process, Brazil has moved&#13;
from a laggard in health indicators to a good performer in recent years. Although the SUS itself&#13;
should not get all the credit for this achievement (improved nutrition, water and sanitation, high&#13;
income, and lower poverty have played an important part), it has certainly contributed&#13;
significantly.&#13;
&#13;
Universal coverage lies at the core of SUS design and values, and was a fundamental aspiration&#13;
of the health reform of the 1980s. However, after 20 years, more than two-thirds of the Brazilian&#13;
population relies on it for most of their health care needs; almost 25 percent are covered by&#13;
private insurance, and 10 to 15 percent rely on out-of-pocket payments. Has the SUS failed to&#13;
achieve the goal of universal coverage? This question has many different answers.&#13;
&#13;
First, from the point of view of the right to health care, every Brazilian is entitled to obtain health&#13;
care under the SUS, and nearly all of those who seek it are treated (less than 5 percent have a&#13;
problem obtaining care). 15 Second, those who do not use SUS as their main source of care are&#13;
likely to use the public system eventually for certain services (such as highly specialized tertiary&#13;
care), and generally when they do not use the SUS, it is by choiceâ&#128;&#148;most users of private health&#13;
insurance or those who make out-of-pocket payments for health prefer not to use SUS services&#13;
because they believe quality and/or access is better in the private sector (for example, long&#13;
waiting times is a source of dissatisfaction for SUS users, although there is little rigorous&#13;
evidence on how long patients wait for various services). Third, the SUS has prioritized&#13;
extension of coverage and improving access for low-income and vulnerable groups, without&#13;
targeting them formally. Every SUS program is open to everyone, but many of the programs,&#13;
such as the FHS, have prioritized underserved regions and areas, where they were most needed.&#13;
As a result, variation in public expenditure and health status indicators was greatly reduced&#13;
across states.&#13;
&#13;
Differently from many countries whose strategy toward universality centered on specific&#13;
programs targeting previously uncovered population groups, Brazil started by legislating the&#13;
right to health within a unified public system, and then went on with gradually designing and&#13;
implementing empirical strategies to operationalize universal coverage and make it effective.&#13;
The SUS has consistently resisted the idea of targeted programs on the grounds that they would&#13;
conflict with the fundamental principle of universal coverage. While targeted programs might be&#13;
&#13;
15&#13;
  A growing proportion of these do not obtain care because of weaknesses in service management rather than&#13;
economic or distance barriers (IBGE, PNAD 2008).&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                                       21&#13;
&amp;#12;more effective in reaching specific population groups, the SUS approach of prioritizing&#13;
vulnerable groups within a single, universal system has proved reasonably successful, and it has&#13;
avoided or limited one frequent and important downside of targeting, which is system&#13;
fragmentation. About one-third of Brazilians do not use the SUS as their regular source of care,&#13;
but it is more a matter of choice than of coverage. Levels of satisfaction with the SUS are fairly&#13;
low and quality of care is a constraint (Gragnolatti et al.). Although data on quality of care are&#13;
limited, studies such as La Forgia and Couttolenc (2008), and the MOHâ&#128;&#153;s own assessment,&#13;
highlight important shortcomings in hospital care.&#13;
&#13;
Regarding primary care, however, a number of studies indicate that the SUS outperforms the&#13;
traditional facility-based approach (Macinko 2011; Macinko, Almeida and Sa 2007) and point to&#13;
the effectiveness of the FHS (Macinko et al. 2006; Rocha and Soares 2010) and its efficiency in&#13;
reducing costly hospitalizations (Macinko 2011). Nonetheless, important inequalities remain in&#13;
the quality of care accessed by different population groups. For example, Mori Sarti et al. (2012)&#13;
show that prevalence of chronic disease went from having a propoor pattern to having a prorich&#13;
pattern when the survey question changed to specify only a medically confirmed diagnosis,&#13;
indicating that the poor are not being diagnosed at the same rate despite reduced inequality and&#13;
increased utilization of health services. This is one of the main challenges facing the SUS in the&#13;
years to come.&#13;
&#13;
10. Pending Agenda&#13;
&#13;
The SUSâ&#128;&#153;s substantial achievements were not without difficulties, and are not without&#13;
qualifications. The SUS still faces a number of challenges, old and new, to its consolidation and&#13;
further improvement. The pending agenda is likely to include the following issues:&#13;
   â&#128;¢   Further expansion of the PCS: The strategy was successful in many aspects, but its core&#13;
       component, the FHS, appears to have reached a plateau at a little over 100 million people,&#13;
       and has been growing much more slowly in recent years. This is partly to be expected&#13;
       since it is harder to make further gains at higher levels of coverage. Expansion in large&#13;
       urban and metropolitan areas has been especially slow. This is likely to be associated&#13;
       with the broader choice of providers patients have in larger urban areas (including, but&#13;
       not limited to, hospital emergency rooms and specialists), and the importance of private&#13;
       health insurance in these areas. The role and features of publicly provided primary care in&#13;
       areas where the private sector covers over 30 percent of the population, as is the case in&#13;
       many large cities, may need to be revised. The recent change to the resource allocation&#13;
       formula, which now favors areas with lower private insurance coverage, is a step in this&#13;
       direction.&#13;
   â&#128;¢   The FHS teams hiring regime: Expansion of the program has relied heavily on&#13;
       contracting FHS teams outside the civil service, through short-term contracts with&#13;
       individuals or organizations. In 2006, 75 percent of municipal spending on FHS staff was&#13;
       through such contracts. Since the issue has been of growing concernâ&#128;&#148;and these unstable&#13;
       arrangements, with high turnover linked to election cycles, have been increasingly&#13;
       challenged politically and legallyâ&#128;&#148;changes were introduced in the contracting of teams&#13;
       and this proportion dropped to 59 percent in 2010 (Municipal Public Healthcare Budget&#13;
       Information System [known as SIOPS)] data). However, the issue remains to a large&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                               22&#13;
&amp;#12;    extent unresolved, and may hamper the programâ&#128;&#153;s future sustainability and expansion&#13;
    until a long-term solution is found. Many different contracting arrangements have been&#13;
    implemented throughout Brazilâ&#128;&#153;s 5,000-plus municipalities. Evidence on the relative&#13;
    performance of alternative arrangements should be a critical input to inform policy&#13;
    decisions in this area.&#13;
â&#128;¢   Care coordination and integration: PCS and its core program, the FHS, have been&#13;
    successful in expanding coverage and improving the effectiveness of primary care;&#13;
    however, its effectiveness has been hampered by difficulties in horizontal and vertical&#13;
    integration. FHS teams are not currently able to monitor or follow their patients through&#13;
    secondary or tertiary care, in part due to limitations in the information system and patient&#13;
    records. Referrals to those levels have been recognizably difficult to operationalize and&#13;
    the situation is unlikely to change until referral systems are improved and more robust&#13;
    patient records are implemented. In the end, this relates to the broader issue of the&#13;
    absence of strong integrated health care networks in Brazil. Existing efforts in this&#13;
    direction are still incipient and scattered, with no rigorous process of evaluation; they&#13;
    need to be amplified, strengthened, and coordinated. The MOH recognizes this as a&#13;
    challenge and has accelerated its efforts in this direction, as reflected in the SUS&#13;
    Healthcare Network Policy launched in late 2010.&#13;
â&#128;¢   Quality of care: While the quality of services provided at the primary level has clearly&#13;
    improved, important weaknesses and gaps remain, especially at the secondary-care level,&#13;
    and in the integration across levels of care. In the absence of a vigorous push toward&#13;
    better quality, this is becoming the main source of inequalities in health, since different&#13;
    groups cannot access standard-quality services. Regarding quality in primary care, the&#13;
    MOH launched an important effort in 2011, the National Program for Improvement in&#13;
    Primary Care Access and Quality. Interested municipalities joined the program by&#13;
    signing a contract among the family health team, municipal health administrators, and the&#13;
    MOH, defining explicit commitments and quality improvement targets. Based on these&#13;
    contracts, action plans aimed at improving management and patient care were developed,&#13;
    which include components on self-assessment, monitoring, continuing education, and&#13;
    institutional support. After 18 months, an external evaluation will be conducted to assess&#13;
    whether access and quality have improved. In a final phase, a new agreement for quality&#13;
    improvement is negotiated. The program includes an incentive payment that varies&#13;
    depending not only on the teamâ&#128;&#153;s performance over time but on how it fairs relative to its&#13;
    peers. The base incentive, which is added to the variable PAB, is approximately&#13;
    US$4,250 per month per family health team and US$1,250 per month per oral health&#13;
    team.&#13;
â&#128;¢   Benefits package: The SUS provides a full range of free services and does not exclude&#13;
    any service from coverage. Such an open-ended approach and the absence of clear&#13;
    criteria for offering and specifying services has made it possible for patients and families&#13;
    to demand in court services that are not yet on the SUS list of services and may not even&#13;
    have been proven effective. These legal demands are posing an increasing financial&#13;
    burden on the system. This is also true for the PCS: there is no explicit approach to define&#13;
    which services are offered under primary care and which are not. While changes to the&#13;
    program over time, for example, the inclusion of chronic diseases such as hypertension&#13;
    and diabetes, do appear to be rational and justified from a primary care perspective, the&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                             23&#13;
&amp;#12;    definition of transparent and stable criteria for inclusion and exclusion would strengthen&#13;
    the program. For instance, the existing drug supply efforts appear insufficient to seriously&#13;
    dent the financial burden associated with out-of-pocket payments for drug purchases,&#13;
    especially among poor households. Current funding for the Basic Pharmacy and Popular&#13;
    Pharmacy programs represent a small part of out-of-pocket spending on drugs, though&#13;
    this spending may be unnecessarily high due to the prescription of off-list drugs,&#13;
    irrational use of over-the-counter drugs, and so forth. Further research on out-of-pocket&#13;
    payments for drugs would be needed to understand its composition and, hopefully, shed&#13;
    light on an expenditure that absorbs a nontrivial share of total health spending.&#13;
â&#128;¢   The relative role of the public and private systems is a growing concern as the two&#13;
    systems become more and more intertwined, especially in large cities where private&#13;
    health insurance covers 25 to 50 percent of the population. Brazilians seem to use either,&#13;
    depending on the particular health care need they experience. The SUS has established a&#13;
    system by which private insurers must reimburse the SUS for the cost of care provided at&#13;
    SUS facilities, but the system has been systematically challenged in court based on the&#13;
    constitutional right of all citizens to use SUS services. In recent years, the National&#13;
    Agency of Supplementary Health (AgÃªncia Nacional de SaÃºde Suplementar), which was&#13;
    not created until 2000, has ramped up its efforts to incorporate private insurance in the&#13;
    MOHâ&#128;&#153;s initiatives to improve transparency and accountability to the public by publishing&#13;
    data on customer complaints and waiting times to schedule appointments for&#13;
    consultations and surgeriesâ&#128;&#148;even decertifying plans that exceed maximum time limits.&#13;
    As noted above, in a limited way, the MOH resource allocation formula for primary care&#13;
    has been changed to include private insurance coverage as a variable, a small but&#13;
    significant step. Tertiary care, however, is the elephant in the room. Even those with&#13;
    private health insurance revert back to the public sector for these services, which absorbs&#13;
    a large share of public resources and are concentrated in urban centers, where the&#13;
    relatively well-off live and can gain preferential access, challenging the SUSâ&#128;&#153;s ability to&#13;
    implement its principle of equitable access.&#13;

&amp;#12;The World Bank supports the efforts of countries to share prosperity by&#13;
transitioning toward universal health coverage (UHC) with the objectives of&#13;
improving health outcomes, reducing the financial risks associated with ill&#13;
health, and increasing equity. The Bank recognizes that there are many paths&#13;
toward UHC and does not endorse a particular path or set of organizational or&#13;
financial arrangements to reach it. Regardless of the path chosen, the quality of&#13;
the instruments and institutions countries establish to implement UHC are&#13;
essential to its success. Countries will face a variety of challenges during the&#13;
implementation phase as they strive to expand health coverage. With that in&#13;
mind, the World Bank launched the Universal Health Coverage Studies Series&#13;
(UNICO Studies Series) to develop knowledge and operational tools designed&#13;
to help countries tackle these implementation challenges in ways that are&#13;
fiscally sustainable and that enhance equity and efficiency. The UNICO Studies&#13;
Series consists of technical papers and country case studies that analyze&#13;
different issues related to the challenges of UHC policy implementation.&#13;
&#13;
The case studies in the series are based on the use of a standardized protocol&#13;
to analyze the nuts and bolts of 27 programs in 25 countries that have&#13;
expanded coverage from the bottom up, starting with the poor and vulnerable.&#13;
The protocol consists of 300 questions designed to elicit a detailed&#13;
understanding of how countries are implementing five sets of policies to&#13;
accomplish the following:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   Manage the benefits package&#13;
â&#128;¢   Manage processes to include the poor and vulnerable&#13;
â&#128;¢   Nudge efficiency reforms to the provision of care&#13;
â&#128;¢   Address new challenges in primary care&#13;
â&#128;¢   Tweak financing mechanisms to align the incentives of different stakeholders&#13;
    in the health sector&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The UNICO Studies Series aims to provide UHC implementers with an expanded toolbox.&#13;
The protocol, case studies and technical papers are being published as part of the Series. A&#13;
comparative analysis of the case studies will be available in 2013.&#13;

            Brazil's primary care strategy
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This case study summarizes the responses
            to the questionnaire on The Nuts and Bolts of the Program
            Expanding Health Coverage to the Poor, developed within the
            framework of the World Bank's UNICO - Universal
            Challenge Program.  By so doing, it assesses the key
            features and the achievements and challenges of Brazil&#146;s
            Primary Care Strategy (PCS) and analyzes the contribution of
            this strategy to the establishment and implementation of
            universal coverage. Section 2 provides context for the
            discussion by summarizing key reforms and the impact of the
            PCS and describes Brazil&#146;s health care delivery and
            financing system. The institutional architecture and
            interaction of the health care program (HCP), in this case
            the PCS, is discussed in section 3. Sections 4 through 8
            outline the main features of the strategy, including the
            identification and targeting of beneficiaries, management of
            public funds, services covered, and the information
            environment. The case study concludes with a discussion of
            lessons learned (section 9) and the pending agenda (section 10).
