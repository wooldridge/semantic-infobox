1. TRANSPORT SECTOR&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1   Eritrea's struggle for independence began in earnest in 1961 following the&#13;
annexation of Eritrea by Ethiopia, and further intensified following the military coup in&#13;
Ethiopia in 1974. The Eritrean Peoples Liberation Front (EPLF), which had begun to&#13;
control parts of the country since the mid- 1970s, finally managed to fully liberate Eritrea&#13;
in May 1991. This coincided with the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic&#13;
Front's victory over the military regime in Ethiopia. Following an internationally&#13;
supervised referendum, Eritrea formally gained its independence on May 24, 1993.&#13;
Ethiopia was among the first nations to recognize Eritrea' s independence, and the two&#13;
countries have established a close relationship. Eritrea became the 178th member of&#13;
IBRD and the 157th member of IDA on July 6, 1994. In October 1995, it became a&#13;
member of IFC.&#13;
1.2   Eritrea is strategically located in the northeast of Africa, with a 1000 km coastline&#13;
on the Red Sea. It is a land of varied topography, climate and rainfall, and it lies in the&#13;
Sahelian rainfall zone. There is good potential to extract petroleum from the Red Sea.&#13;
The country's coastal waters are also believed to be among the most potentially&#13;
productive fishing grounds in the Red Sea. Eritrea's population is estimated to be in the&#13;
range of 3-3.5 million, including nearly 500,000 Eritrean refugees in Sudan.&#13;
1.3   The Eritrean economy has a relatively diverse productive base. In comparison to&#13;
other African countries, agriculture accounts for a lower share of the GDP - 15 to 25&#13;
percent depending on the rainfall. Industry accounts for 20 percent of GDP and its&#13;
contribution varies less. Services accounts for the bulk of national output at 50 to 60&#13;
percent of GDP. The rehabilitation and expansion of these sectors will increase growth in&#13;
the medium term. In the long-run, growth will be boosted by the fruits of the on-going&#13;
private investments in mining, fishery and tourism sectors. These sectors have made&#13;
progress in attracting direct foreign investment.&#13;
1.4   The return to peace, the recovery and the rehabilitation efforts, institutional&#13;
reforms, and policy developments, have contributed to reviving a run-down economy.&#13;
After contracting by more than one percent per annum during the period 1985 to 1993,&#13;
real GDP grew by almost 8 percent per annum on average during 1994 and 1996.&#13;
Industrial production as well as service activities have continued to expand in the recent&#13;
past due primarily to a growing private micro-enterprise sector, the partial rehabilitation of&#13;
a few large-scale industrial enterprises, a strong pick-up of construction activity, and a&#13;
good harvest. Sustaining such high growth rates will require maintaining the momentum&#13;
towards improving macroeconomic policies and further strengthening sectoral policies to&#13;
encourage investment, as well as substantial external assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
1.5    One of the initial successes of the Government's reform and recovery program has&#13;
been the growth and some diversification in foreign trade. Exports have recovered&#13;
significantly, starting from an extremely low base, and have increased by almost 50 percent&#13;
per annum in US dollar terms in the last two years. Preliminary data show that exports to&#13;
the non-Birr area have risen from US$1 million in 1992 to US$29 million in 1994 while&#13;
those to the Birr area (Ethiopia) rose from US$14 million to US$26 million. Merchandise&#13;
imports also increased substantially and it is estimated that in 1994, they amounted to&#13;
US$41 million from the Birr area and US$348 million from the non-Birr area. Salt is&#13;
currently the most important export item, follow by beverages and tobacco. Broader&#13;
efforts are required to put Eritrea's export sector on a sustainable path of growth with the&#13;
assistance of private investment, improvement in the macroeconomic framework, and&#13;
strengthening of the enabling environment at the micro-level.&#13;
B. THE ERITREAN TRANSPORT SYSTEM&#13;
1.6   More than thirty years of war have left Eritrea's transport infrastructure in a&#13;
severely dilapidated state. The road network and port facilities require extensive&#13;
rehabilitation. Failure to rectify these deficiencies will impede the flow of goods and&#13;
services, hamper the development of export-oriented agriculture and industry, increase&#13;
transport costs and ultimately retard economic growth.&#13;
1.7   The road network in Eritrea is small, under 6000 km of main and rural roads, of&#13;
which less than 1000 km can be considered all-weather. At one time, they represented a&#13;
well developed road system. A complete absence of even routine maintenance, due mainly&#13;
to the prolonged war situation, has led to severe deterioration of the system Some&#13;
important improvements are under way, particularly the rehabilitation and widening of the&#13;
Asmara - Massawa road, and the detailed design of the Nefasit - Tera Imni road is&#13;
expected to start in the near.future.&#13;
1.8   The land transport previously included railways which ran between Bisria and&#13;
Massawa via Asmara - Keren - Agordat, and a shorter line which ran between Mersa&#13;
Fatma and Colluli in the Eastern part of the country. Eritrea was also the site of the&#13;
teleferrica, the longest overhead tramway in the world which carried freight between&#13;
Massawa and Asmara. The railways had ceased operations by the early years of the&#13;
Dergue regime while the teleferrica was dismantled at the end of the British trusteeship in&#13;
1952.&#13;
1.9   The commercial trucking fleet is currently underutilized, although there is some&#13;
indication that some rural areas are not well served because drivers refuse to take their&#13;
trucks over the existing poor roads and, as a result, farmers find it difficult to market&#13;
crops. In contrast to the trucking fleet, there is shortage of commercial passenger&#13;
vehicles, which has led the Government to regulate the sector to prevent a concentration&#13;
of services around Asmara. Currently, the sector is performing reasonably well in terms of&#13;
cost recovery.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1.10  Eritrea has two outlets to the sea located at Massawa and Assab. The port of&#13;
Massawa developed its present facilities between 1885 and 1940. The port of Assab was&#13;
constructed in 1959 and serves as the major gateway for Ethiopia, and is also important in&#13;
that the refinery is located there. As with the road infrastructure, both ports suffered from&#13;
damage and lack of maintenance during the Liberation War.&#13;
1.11   Civil aviation is presently focused on the international airport of Asmara and to a&#13;
lesser extent the commercially important airport of Assab. There are currently a number&#13;
of regional air services operated by Egypt, Yemenia and Ethiopian Airlines. Ethiopian&#13;
also operates Asmara-Assab-Addis services twice a week, and daily regional and&#13;
European services are provided by Ethiopian as well as Lufthansa. The passenger and&#13;
freight terminals at Asmara International Airport have recently undergone a major&#13;
rehabilitation and expansion program, although it still would require substantial investment&#13;
in navigational aids and communications in order to meet ICAO standards. Nonetheless,&#13;
operations are currently carried out on a 24-hour basis.&#13;
C. ROLE OF TRANSPORT IN THE ECONOMY&#13;
1.12  The transport system is essential for the domestic economy and is also one of the&#13;
most important sources of foreign exchange earnings. The once well developed&#13;
infrastructure of Eritrea has been severely damaged by the war. This is currently a major&#13;
constraint on growth, especially by limiting access of producers to the markets. Ports and&#13;
roads in particular are constraints in need of immediate attention.&#13;
D. CRITICAL TRANSPORT ISSUES IN ERITREA&#13;
1.13   Transport conditions are major constraints to economic and social development in&#13;
Eritrea. Under the emergency RRPE, some initial and urgent support has been provided&#13;
by the IDA and other donors for the purpose of essential equipment and material to repair&#13;
and rehabilitate the most important roads (particularly the Asmara - Massawa road) and&#13;
some bridges.&#13;
1.14   A coherent transport strategy for Eritrea is under development with EU funding.&#13;
A consultant was appointed in January 1996 to assist the Government to carry out a study&#13;
with the following objectives:&#13;
*   carry out a base-line survey of the transport sector identifying its main&#13;
characteristics, main problems and opportunities in all areas including policy,&#13;
strategy, infrastructure, institutions, and management capability,&#13;
*  to set out and assess options for the development of the transport sector&#13;
covering reforms, investments, and donor mobilization; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
* to make recommendations and a plan of action for developing the transport&#13;
sector to the benefit of Eritrea covering policy reforms, investments, and&#13;
donor mobilization; and including the ranking and prioritization of both&#13;
reforms and investments within the transport sector as a whole and between&#13;
sub-sectors.&#13;
1.15  The draft findings and recommendations of the study, which has been looking into&#13;
the sub-sectors of roads, ports and shipping, aviation and railways, are presently under&#13;
discussion within the Government.&#13;
1.16  Without a significant increase in effective port capacity in the country, Massawa&#13;
and Assab would not be able to handle the base traffic forecasts, which are predicted to&#13;
grow at a relative modest rate but with a significant shift to containers and general cargo.&#13;
E. BANK STRATEGY&#13;
1.17 Country Assistance Strategy: The long-term goal of Eritrea, once recovery and&#13;
reconstruction tasks have been completed, is to build a modern, technologically advanced,&#13;
export-oriented economy, which will capitalize on its strategic position and natural&#13;
resources, and based on self-reliance, technology transfer, and private investment. Private&#13;
investment has been identified as the engine of growth and development, although Eritrea&#13;
has not inherited a working private sector. The strategy seeks to accomplish this objective&#13;
by:&#13;
*   creating an environment in which the private sector will develop and flourish,&#13;
in partnership with foreign investors;&#13;
*   reducing infrastructure constraints; and&#13;
*   investing in human resources.&#13;
1.18  In order to build a strong partnership with Eritrea, the Bank Group's assistance&#13;
strategy will continue to be governed by the principle of maintaining clear government&#13;
ownership of the programs.&#13;
1.19  The once well developed infrastructure of Eritrea has been severely damaged by&#13;
the war. This is currently a major constraint on growth, especially limiting access of&#13;
producers to the markets. Ports, roads, energy, and telecoms are constraints in need of&#13;
immediate attention.&#13;
1.20  Critical issues now facing the port industry are being addressed through the&#13;
proposed project (see Sections 2 and 3), and in the preparatory works for Phase II and III&#13;
of the development of the sector.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
F. PREVIOUS BANK GROUP INVOLVEMENT IN THE ERITREA PORT SECTOR&#13;
1.21  This will be the first IDA operation in Eritrea's port sector involving substantial&#13;
rehabilitation. However, the expansion of facilities at Assab Port to provide the port with&#13;
the capacity and ability to handle containerized traffic was a component of the Ethiopia&#13;
Transport Project, Credit 2002-ET. The construction of two new container berths had&#13;
just started in 1991/92, when control of the port changed and the project was terminated.&#13;
G. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.22  The rationale for IDA involvement is based on: (i) the importance of the port&#13;
sector to a successful economic recovery program; (ii) IDA's previous involvement in the&#13;
port sector in Ethiopia (Assab); and (iii) the contribution IDA can make to the reform&#13;
process based on its experience in taking the lead role in formulating port modernization&#13;
programs in neighboring countries along the east coast of Africa.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

2. THE PORT SUB-SECTOR&#13;
A. ORGANIZATION&#13;
2.1    With the end of the war in May 1991, the Provisional Government of Eritrea&#13;
established the Department of Ports and Maritime Transport (DPMT) by proclamation&#13;
No. 23/92, Art. 7 No. 1.17. The department was established to develop, improve,&#13;
maintain, operate and regulate the port and shipping industry in Eritrea. The DPMT,&#13;
under the President's Office, was legally responsible for: (i) all port activities in Massawa&#13;
and Assab; (ii) a ship repair yard in Massawa; and (iii) Eritrea Shipping Transit Agencies&#13;
Services (ERSTAS - the sole ship's agent, and major freight forwarding agent), and the&#13;
Eritrea Shipping Lines'. In May, 1993 the DPMT was re-established as the Ports &amp;&#13;
Maritime Authority (PMTA), and in early 1994 when the headquarters was relocated to&#13;
Massawa, the PMTA was re-established as the Eritrea Ports Authority (EPA), still&#13;
reporting to the President's Office. In 1995 the Government decided to organize the ports&#13;
within a Department of Maritime Transport (DMT) under the Ministry of Transport and&#13;
Communication, and the two ports were established as autonomous commercial entities&#13;
under the supervision of a sector board chaired by the Minister of Transport and&#13;
Communication.&#13;
2.2   The port of Massawa serves as the major port for import/export of Eritrean cargo,&#13;
and for an increasing volume of traffic for northern Ethiopia (Tigray), while Assab is&#13;
primarily a transit port for Ethiopian trade, accounting for about 85 percent of Ethiopia's&#13;
total external trade. Over 95 percent of the dry cargo passing through port of Assab is&#13;
Ethiopian trade.&#13;
2.3   The organizational structures of two ports, employing the following staff, are&#13;
shown in Annex 16:&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-7-&#13;
2.4   Lack of maintenance and damages by the war have left the infrastructure of the&#13;
two ports in a dilapidated shape, and it has been with great difficulty that the ports have&#13;
managed to handle the increasing traffic. The two ports suffer from slow cargo handling&#13;
rates (especially for containers) and shortage of suitable equipment.&#13;
2.5   Problems and weaknesses in the Customs Administration include outdated and&#13;
inefficient operational systems and procedures, and lack of skilled staff. Specific&#13;
weaknesses include an antiquated import declaration system, characterized by inefficient&#13;
and superfluous formalities and procedural steps, and lack of selectivity in checking the&#13;
goods. This results sometimes in cumbersome and slow goods clearance process, which&#13;
in turn increases the cargo dwell time in the ports. The Government has started to address&#13;
the shortcomings and to simplify documentation and procedures, and has also decided to&#13;
install the customs computerized system ASYCUDA at the two ports and the airport.&#13;
This component, originally planned to be part of the project, will be implemented&#13;
simultaneously with the project under Italian funding. Included in the project, however, is&#13;
the construction of a customs building in Massawa.&#13;
2.6   In order to transform the two ports into modern, efficient, commercially-oriented&#13;
and profit-generating enterprises, higher and middle management staff will need to be&#13;
trained in leadership, personnel management planning and decision-making techniques,&#13;
information and communication, economics and financial management, and safety and&#13;
environmental aspects. The port management staff in Eritrea is highly motivated and&#13;
determined to succeed. The ports are already enjoying technical assistance from the&#13;
Federal Republic of Germany within the scope of bilateral technical cooperation. This&#13;
Eritrean-German Port Development Project (EPDP) started in early July 1995 and&#13;
comprises a total of 48 man-months (mm) of technical assistance including 12 mm in the&#13;
field of training with a clear emphasis on train-the-trainer programs. Additional training,&#13;
particularly in the fields of port operations and equipment maintenance, will be provided&#13;
under the project (para. 3.8).&#13;
B. PORT OF MASSAWA&#13;
2.7   Massawa port was founded in 1665 by the Turks and took its present shape during&#13;
the Italian rule (1885-194 1). The port is situated on the northern shore of Massawa&#13;
Island, and consists of six general purpose berths with a port area inside a customs wall&#13;
with sheds, warehouses and open storage facilities. The exact timing of developments and&#13;
the order of berth construction are not known as there are no reliable records available. It&#13;
is believed that the most recent construction was that of Berths 5 (half) and Berth 6&#13;
around 1940, and that all the present berths were constructed in the period 1926 to 1940.&#13;
2.8   The enclosed harbor is given additional protection by short breakwater arms&#13;
extending south from Abd-el-Kader Peninsula and north from Massawa Island. Both&#13;
breakwaters were constructed in 1926 and are rubble mound constructions protected by&#13;
armor stones or concrete capping. The breakwaters are both in relatively good condition.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8-&#13;
2.9 The commercial port consists of six general purpose berths, aprons, warehouses,&#13;
open sheds and open storage areas. Other facilities at Massawa are:&#13;
* Bulk salt loading jetties located on the south shore of Gherar Peninsula;&#13;
* Ship repair facilities administered by the DMT and located west of the salt&#13;
jetties;&#13;
*  An oil termninal and a jetty at Taulud Bay. The terminal is operated by Total&#13;
and Mobil Oil;&#13;
* Another oil terminal at Hargigo Bay, towards the south operated by Agip Oil;&#13;
and&#13;
* A naval base at the southern part of the Abd-el-Kader Peninsula.&#13;
2.10  The approaches to Massawa port are without major difficulties. The port is&#13;
covered by Admiralty Chart No. 460. The channels used are north and south. The&#13;
entrance to the commercial port is navigational 24 hours a day, and is lighted with green&#13;
and red lights. There are two leading marks with red lights to assist maneuvering day and&#13;
night. The Massawa port is in charge of eight lighthouses in the Red Sea, of which only&#13;
one, Mdote, vAth a light range of 13 nautical miles, is functional. The main Massawa&#13;
Light House (Risi Midri), with a light range of 16 miles, is also run by Massawa port.&#13;
2.11  There are no significant currents inside the harbor, and the tidal range of spring&#13;
tides is 1.5 meters at the maximum. The port provides pilotage from dawn to dusk, and&#13;
the pilotage is compulsory for all ships over 100 GRT. Calling ships should give seven&#13;
days notice of arrival. Tug and pilot boats are available.&#13;
2.12  The port is served by five rail mounted quay cranes. The cranes cover berths 3, 4&#13;
and 5. A sixth quay crane is not working. The cranes, built in 1975, are in a poor&#13;
condition due to lack of maintenance. The lifting capacity is 5 tons at 20 meters and 6&#13;
tons at 16 meters. The cranes can be mounted with grabs for discharging bulk cargo.&#13;
2.13  The port fleet of lifting equipment also includes seven mobile cranes. Most of&#13;
these are in a bad condition. A 50-ton crane lacks spare parts and has thus not been in&#13;
operation since November 1994. A 100-ton crane is the only one in a good condition.&#13;
The mobile cranes are used for discharging and loading general cargo onto vessels, and&#13;
are also often used for loading and unloading cargo onto trucks in the storage areas.&#13;
2.14  In April 1997 the port acquired cargo handling equipment worth US$2.0 million&#13;
under a Japanese Grant, including a reach stacker for handling of 40 foot containers, 10&#13;
fork lift trucks, and 4 tugmasters with trailers.&#13;
2.15  The port handled 610,000 tons of cargo at its own berths in 1996. In addition,&#13;
local oil terminals handled a further 160,000 tons, giving a total of 770,000 tons.&#13;
International cargo accounted for 97% of the total handled at the port, and almost 97% of&#13;
the cargo was imports. Cargo volumes have fluctuated erratically since independence in&#13;
1991, mainly because food aid cargoes have varied. The total cargo (excluding petroleum&#13;
products) at the main port are detailed in Table 2.1:&#13;
&#13;

1996           610,000&#13;
2.16  Dry cargo traffic handled through Massawa in 1994 is the highest on record, and&#13;
the aid cargo for the year accounted for well over half of the total.&#13;
2.17  The traffic projections for the years 1994 to 2005 indicate that the aid cargo will&#13;
decline, but non-aid cargo rise rapidly, following trends since independence. The overall&#13;
growth rate forecast for the period is 4.5% p.a., and can be summarized as in Table 2.2.&#13;

p.a. 1994-2005&#13;
2.18  The traffic forecast has been complicated by: (i) the limited statistical information&#13;
available; and (ii) the little relevance to long term growth rates that can be drawn from the&#13;
five years growth rates after the end of the war.&#13;
2.19  The average berth occupancy rate for 1994 was just over 70%. Without&#13;
investment in additional quay length, berth occupancy is forecast to rise to 92% in 2000&#13;
and 106% in 2005 (which is not feasible and would theoretically result in infinite berthing&#13;
delays) and traffic at the port would be suppressed. Even with 90 percent berth&#13;
occupancy, there would be very substantial delays and ships would spend as much time&#13;
waiting for a berth as being worked.&#13;
2.20  The traffic forecast and analysis by handling methods indicate a rapid growth in&#13;
container traffic. The total containerized traffic in 1994 was 4,646 TEU's, and the&#13;
forecasts for year 2000 and 2005 are 16,570 and 28,198, respectively. Without the&#13;
rehabilitation and expansion of berth 6, including additional stacking areas, it would be&#13;
impossible for the port to handle forecast containerized traffic. A more detailed&#13;
description of Massawa port is given in Annex 1.&#13;

C. PORT OF ASSAB&#13;
2.21   The present commercial port was completed in 1959 and consists of two jetties&#13;
which extend SSE from the shore forning a basin 300 m wide. The general cargo berths&#13;
are aligned to the predominant wind direction on the inner faces of the jetties. The berths&#13;
are protected from waves generated by SE winds by a detached breakwater.&#13;
2.22   The North Jetty provides a total berth length of 490 m which is divided into 3&#13;
berths (berths 1, 2 and 3). All berths provide 11.0 m depth of water alongside. The South&#13;
Jetty provides a total berth length of 530 m which is divided into 4 berths (Berths 8 to 1 1).&#13;
The available depths of water alongside are between 5.8 m (Berth 8) to 10.0 m (Berths 10&#13;
and 1-1). The berths on both jetties are of concrete block construction, and the overall&#13;
width of the jetties is around 100 m. At the outer end of the South Jetty is a small&#13;
concrete Ro/Ro ramp for berthing Ro/Ro vessels with either stern or bow ramp. To the&#13;
south of the port is the Assab Oil Refinery and a number of marine oil terminal facilities&#13;
for discharging/loading of crude oil and refined products.&#13;
2.23   The port of Assab is Ethiopia's primary access to the sea, accounting for about 85&#13;
percent of its total external trade. Ethiopia dominates dry cargo traffic at the port (over 95&#13;
percent). Port traffic increased very substantially in the early 1980's (primarily growth in&#13;
relief cargo but 'with some increase in commercial cargo), fell significantly in the early&#13;
1990's, after the change in regime, and has subsequently recovered to previous levels.&#13;
Port traffic for the last four years is detailed in Table 2.3.&#13;

2.24   Dry cargo traffic handled during 1996 was approximately equal to the maximum&#13;
handled during the 1980's but was achieved without the major congestion previously&#13;
experienced.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2.25   Major increases in the total volume of dry cargo traffic are not expected but very&#13;
substantial shifts in the commodity distribution are probable:&#13;
*  the high level of 1996 fertilizer imports is expected to continue, even if donor&#13;
assistance is reduced;&#13;
*  grain production in Ethiopia will expand significantly and there will be a&#13;
gradual decline in the average level of food imports, although there will still be&#13;
marked fluctuations depending upon rainfall and domestic production;&#13;
*  economic growth in Ethiopia will result in a continued increase in imports of&#13;
raw materials, vehicles and machinery and other general cargo. The growth&#13;
rate is expected to be approximately equal to the growth in GDP, i.e. about 6&#13;
percent per annum; and&#13;
*  coffee and other agricultural exports have increased since 1992, and this&#13;
growth is expected to continue.&#13;
2.26   The central forecast for traffic through Assab in 2000 is provided in Table 2.4,&#13;
together with the impact of forecasts based on rather more optimistic and pessimistic&#13;
forecasts for the Ethiopia economy. In terms of port tonnage, both the optimistic and&#13;
pessimistic forecasts could result in higher port traffic but with veiy different commodity&#13;
flows:&#13;

2.27   The shift in commodity distribution will increase pressure on present port capacity&#13;
as handling productivity for general, break-bulk cargo is only 25 percent of the level for&#13;
bulk and bagged commodities.&#13;
2.28   In addition to the changes in commodity distribution brought about by economic&#13;
growth in Ethiopia, the trend toward containerization is also likely to continue. The&#13;
inward and outward movement of containerized cargo has increased very rapidly since the&#13;
&#13;

since 1993, now totaling over 250,000 tons, between 30 - 40 percent of non-bulk/bagged&#13;
traffic.&#13;
2.30   The trend toward containerization has yet to be reflected in inland movements and&#13;
most containers continue to be stripped/stuffed in Assab, with traffic carried on trucks as&#13;
conventional cargo. The shift to full container movement is only a matter of time,&#13;
however, and the development of inland container facilities has high priority within&#13;
Ethiopia.&#13;
D. STRATEGY FOR THE PORT SECTOR&#13;
2.31   To some extent, important issues facing the Eritrean port sector are policy-related,&#13;
and the Government has started to address these through regulatory reform and&#13;
restructuring. Recognizing that major changes were required, the Government in 1995&#13;
restructured the DMT as a department within the Ministry of Transport and&#13;
Communication, to be responsible for policies and regulatory matters including the&#13;
responsibility for planning and programming of the development of maritime transport&#13;
capacity, safety, environment and other supporting services. The two ports were in this&#13;
restructuring established as autonomous commercial entities under the supervision of a&#13;
sector board chaired by the Minister of Transport and Communication. Government policy&#13;
with regard to the port sector at large is set out in a Letter of Port Sector Policy (Annex&#13;
4).&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. IDENTIFICATION AND PREPARATION&#13;
3.1   Following the Government's request in January 1995 for World Bank assistance in&#13;
the ports sector, an identification mission was launched in February 1995 to discuss the&#13;
strategies and key issues, and to start preparatory works. A study was commissioned in&#13;
late May 1995 under Danish Trust Fund financing to: (i) prepare an overall port&#13;
development program for Massawa (Phase I for the year 1995 to 2005) including traffic&#13;
forecasting and engineering works for the rehabilitation of Berths 5 and 6; (ii) prepare a&#13;
program for improvements in port operations; and (iii) recommend appropriate&#13;
improvements in administrative and management systems. The project was pre-appraised&#13;
in January 1996, appraised in April 1996, and post-appraised in April 1997.&#13;
B. OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.2   The proposed project is the first phase of the Government's program for&#13;
development of the port sector. (The second and third phases wi]l be the subject of a&#13;
Development Study to be carried out under the project.) It supports the economic and&#13;
recovery program contained in the Government's Policy and Sector Strategy Papers&#13;
(Macro-Policy), and in the Country Assistance Strategy (Report # 15324-ER, February 5,&#13;
1996). The aim is for Eritrea to be an outward oriented and trading nation, and ports will&#13;
therefore play a critical role in the future expansion of the economy.&#13;
3.3   To address the urgent capacity requirements up to the year 2005, the proposed&#13;
project is designed to increase substantially the productivity and capacity of the two ports&#13;
of Massawa and Assab. To this end, the project would provide the financial and technical&#13;
assistance required to rehabilitate and upgrade the two ports, optimizing the use of&#13;
existing facilities, and to raise the quality and level of services to international standards.&#13;
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
3.4   In addition to the changes which are needed in the institutional set-up and in the&#13;
management and operation of the two ports, investments in the infrastructure are&#13;
necessary to provide the capacity necessary to meet the forecast traffic demands. The&#13;
overall composition of the proposed project is as follows:&#13;
Project Components&#13;
3.5    Civil Works (US$18.65 million)'. This component consists of repair,&#13;
rehabilitation and extension of berths 5 and 6, dredging in front of the new berth 6 to 12 m&#13;
Amounts shown are basc costs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
depth, reclamation of land behind berth 6, and heavy duty pavement for the new container&#13;
stacking yard. Also included under this component are clearing of the apron and storage&#13;
areas adjacent to berths 5 and 6, rehabilitation of the electrical and storm drainage&#13;
systems, a building for the port administration and customs authorities, a workshop, an&#13;
equipment shed and improvements to warehouses in the port.&#13;
3.6   Cargo Handling Equipment (US$22.65 million). Most of the equipment&#13;
included in this component is for handling of containers. Investment in Massawa is for a&#13;
mobile container handling crane, tugmasters and trailers, a 20 ton mobile crane, a fire&#13;
fighting truck, shore cranes and cargo handling and communication equipment. A&#13;
provisional sum for spare parts for repairs of old fork lift trucks and shore cranes, and a&#13;
pilot boat is also included. For Assab are included two mobile cranes to carry out ship-to-&#13;
shore handling of containers, reach stackers for full and empty containers at the stacking&#13;
yard, tugmasters and trailers, small fork lift trucks for stripping and stuffing containers and&#13;
for operating in the ship's hold, a 50 ton mobile crane and a fire fighting truck. A&#13;
replacement tugboat for Assab has also been included under this component.&#13;
3.7   Environment (US$1.6 million). Facilities and equipment, estimated at&#13;
US$800,000 for each of the two ports, have been included in the project to improve&#13;
operating practices regarding handling of hazardous cargo, as well as control of discharge&#13;
of bilge water and solid waste from ships, and oil spill combat equipment including&#13;
support in institutional building and training for the two ports to comply with a National&#13;
Oil Spill Contingency Plan, presently under preparation with assistance from the&#13;
International Maritime Organization (IMO).&#13;
3.8   Training (US$0.6 million). The project will provide funds for training programs,&#13;
particularly in the fields of port operations and equipment maintenance, including overseas&#13;
training at recognized international institutes, and/or at overseas ports with similar&#13;
facilities and operational constraints and systems. The training component will be closely&#13;
coordinated with the ongoing EPDP program (para. 2.6). Included in this component is&#13;
also equipment and non-wage operating costs for the Project Coordination Unit (PCU,&#13;
para. 4. 1).&#13;
3.9   Consultancy Services (US$4.5 million). The project will include financing of&#13;
consultancy services for: (i) supervision of the civil works in Massawa; (ii) short term&#13;
experts to assist in drafting technical specifications and bidding documents for equipment&#13;
and spare parts procurement, evaluation of bids and recommendations for award of&#13;
contracts; (iii) specific studies in the field of maritime and port legislation, MIS, cost&#13;
accounting, tariff analysis and commercialization of port activities; (iv) a study of the long&#13;
term development of the port sector (Phases II and III); and (v) short term technical&#13;
assistance in port management and operations, and equipment maintenance.&#13;

3.11   The estimates are based on 1996 price levels. Price contingencies have been&#13;
calculated on an average annual international inflation rate of 2.6 percent. This inflation&#13;
rate has been used for both foreign and local costs as it has been assumed that any&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16&#13;
differences between local and international price inflation will be offset by equivalent&#13;
adjustments in Eritrea's foreign exchange rate. Physical contingencies of 10 percent have&#13;
been added to the base cost of civil works. Price and physical contingencies total US$9.6&#13;
million, or 20 percent of the total project cost.&#13;
E. FINANCING&#13;
3.12  IDA's contribution will be US$30.3 million, or 53 percent of the total project cost&#13;
net of taxes. Italy has agreed to co-finance US$21.0 million of the cost of the Massawa&#13;
component under an untied grant. The Grant Agreement was approved by the Board of&#13;
Italian Cooperation on July 26, 1996, and a Trust Fund Agreement was signed between&#13;
Italy and IDA on October 22, 1996. An Agreement between Eritrea and IDA on purposes&#13;
and terms and conditions for withdrawal of the Italian Grant was signed on June 9, 1997.&#13;
The State of Eritrea will finance the local component of the project, estimated at the&#13;
equivalent of US$6.3 million.&#13;

3.13  The Government's policy is that commercial entities like the ports would be&#13;
required to generate at a minimum revenues sufficient to cover working capital&#13;
requirements and debt service obligations. The intention is therefore that the proposed&#13;
IDA Credit of US$30.3 million, as well as the Italian Grant of US$2 1.0 equivalent, will be&#13;
on-lent to the two ports at an interest rate equivalent to a commercial loan, and that the&#13;
ports would bear the foreign exchange risk.&#13;
3.14  Subsidiary loan agreements between the Government and each of the ports of&#13;
Massawa and Assab will be signed as soon as the new maritime and port legislation has&#13;
been completed, and the two ports have been granted their own financial autonomy. As&#13;
indicated in the Letter of Port Sector Policy, it is estimated that subsidiary loan&#13;
agreements with the ports will signed and effective as of December 3 1, 1999.&#13;

4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES&#13;
4.1   Implementation of the project will be the responsibility of the Ministry of&#13;
Transport and Communication (MTC) through its Department of Maritime Transport&#13;
(DMT). A Project Coordination Unit (PCU) has already been established for the life of&#13;
the project and is located at the Port Liaison Office in Asmara. The unit is headed by a&#13;
Project Coordinator, and includes financial and procurement expertise. The functions of&#13;
the unit will include:&#13;
*  Overall coordination of project activities&#13;
*  Supervision of short-term consultants&#13;
*  Project monitoring and evaluation:&#13;
Keeping project records&#13;
Preparing project accounts&#13;
Monitoring of procurement&#13;
Monitoring of key performance indicators&#13;
Preparing project reports (quarterly and annually)&#13;
-  Disbursements&#13;
Preparing withdrawal applications&#13;
Monitoring disbursements&#13;
Opening letters of credit&#13;
Special Account&#13;
3  Procurement (either directly or through supervision of consultants)&#13;
4.2   To clarify the roles and responsibilities of each entity involved in project&#13;
implementation, a Project Implementation Plan (PIP) has been prepared. The content of&#13;
the PIP was discussed and agreed during negotiations. Annex 7 gives a summary chart of.&#13;
the key project implementation steps; detailed implementation plans for the project as a&#13;
whole and specific components are included in the PIP (copy in the Project Files).&#13;
4.3   A meeting of port users (port authorities, customs, representatives of the trucking&#13;
industry, shipping agencies, etc.) will be convened regularly (once every quarter) at each&#13;
port to report on project progress and discuss issues which may affect the port users in the&#13;
course of project implementation.&#13;

administration, as well as a workshop, an equipment shed and improvements to&#13;
warehouses in the port of Massawa, estimated at less than US$500,000 equivalent per&#13;
contract up to an aggregate amount of US$4.6 million, will be awarded on the basis of&#13;
National Competitive Bidding (NCB) procedures acceptable to IDA. This would include&#13;
advertising the works, public opening of bids, clearly stated evaluation criteria and award&#13;
to the lowest bidder. Foreign bidders, if interested, would not be precluded from&#13;
participation. Assurances to this effect have been obtained and the NCB documents,&#13;

procured through competition among qualified short-listed firms in which selection will be&#13;
based on Quality-and Cost-Based Selection (QCBS). For short term assignments&#13;
(assistance in drafting bidding documents, specific studies in port legislation, MIS, cost&#13;
accounting, tariff analysis and commercialization of port activities, technical assistance in&#13;
port management and equipment maintenance) estimated to cost less than US$75,000 per&#13;
contract up to an aggregate of US$500,000, the selection would be based on the&#13;
Consultants' Qualifications. Single-Source Selection will be exceptionally used for&#13;
very small (short term) assignments estimated to cost less than US$25,000 per contract up&#13;
to an aggregate of US$150,000, where a rapid selection is required and/or only one&#13;
firm/individual is qualified.&#13;

4.10  Short-lists for contracts (estimated at less than US$200,000 per contract) for the&#13;
design and site supervision of buildings to be constructed in the port of Massawa (port&#13;
administration, customs, workshop, equipment shed, warehouses) may be comprised&#13;
entirely of national consultants if a sufficient number of qualified firms (at least three) are&#13;
available at competitive costs. However, if foreign firms have expressed interest for those&#13;
contracts, they will not be excluded from consideration. The standard Letter of Invitation&#13;
and Form of Contracts as developed by the Bank will be used for appointment of&#13;
consultants. Simplified contracts will be used for short-term assignments, i.e. those not&#13;
exceeding three months, carried out by firms or individual consultants. The Government&#13;
has been briefed about the features of the new Consultants Guidelines (January 1997), in&#13;
particular with regard to advertisement and public bid opening.&#13;
4.11  Training: Selection of consultants and firms providing services for lectures and&#13;
training, estimated to cost less than US$100,000 per contract up to an aggregate of&#13;
US$700,000 will be based on the Consultants' Qualifications among those expressing&#13;
interests in the assignment or approached directly. Single Source Selection, estimated at&#13;
less than US$25,000 per contract up to an aggregate of US$100,000, will be exceptionally&#13;
used for the training of management staff.&#13;
4.12  All IDA and Italian grant financed contracts for goods and works above&#13;
US$100,000 would be subject to prior review by IDA, as would all consultancy contracts&#13;
for firms above US$100,000 and for individuals above US$75,000. A General&#13;
Procurement Notice (GPN) was initially published in the Development Business Forum on&#13;
June 16, 1996, and an update of the GPN was published in issue 464 of June 16, 1997.&#13;
An invitation for prequalification of civil works contractors was published on June 16,&#13;
1997. Specific procurement notices will be published as per the Guidelines.&#13;
4.13  The PCU established for the project has already sent two of its key staff to attend a&#13;
Bank sponsored seminar in procurement of Goods and Equipment. The same staff are&#13;
scheduled for similar training in Procurement of Works and Consulting Services, to be&#13;
completed by March 31, 1998. In preparing TORs, technical specifications and bidding&#13;
documents, as well as for evaluating proposals and negotiating contracts, the PCU will&#13;
also have access to expertise from DMT's Engineering Department, and short term&#13;
Consultants from specialized firms. The importance of having PCU adequately staffed for&#13;
carrying out procurement efficiently during the implementation of the project was&#13;
discussed and agreed with the Borrower during post-appraisal.&#13;
4.14  At negotiations, standard procurement processing time for key activities were&#13;
agreed with the Borrower, and are reflected in the PIP.&#13;

under the SOE procedures will be retained for review by IDA supervision missions. To&#13;
facilitate the availability of funds for the Project, a Special Account would be established&#13;
and maintained on terms and conditions satisfactory to IDA. An initial deposit of&#13;
US$500,000 will be replenished on the basis of satisfactory documentary evidence,&#13;
provided to IDA, of eligible payments made from the account for goods and services&#13;
required for the Project. An estimated schedule of disbursement of the proceeds from the.&#13;
IDA Credit and the Italian Grant are in Annex 8.&#13;
D. REPORTING AND AUDITING&#13;
4.19 The PCU (DMT) will be responsible for accounting, audit and financial reporting&#13;
activities. Funds accounts will be maintained in accordance with Generally Accepted&#13;
Accounting Standards (GAAS) on a PC-based accounting program. Training will be&#13;
provided to the PCU staff to familiarize them with the accounting and MIS programs&#13;
before the beginning of project implementation. The annual financial statements will be&#13;
audited in accordance with International Standards of Auditing by independent auditors&#13;
acceptable to the Government and IDA.&#13;
4.20  The Project's audited financial statements with the auditor's report thereon, and&#13;
the auditor's management letter covering internal control and any accounting procedures&#13;
weaknesses discovered as a result of the audit, will be sent to IDA within six months of&#13;
the end of the period audited.&#13;
4.21   The DMT will also have the financial statements of Massawa and Assab ports&#13;
audited by independent auditors acceptable to the Government and IDA. The audited&#13;
accounts of the two ports will be sent to IDA not later than six months after the end of the&#13;
fiscal year.&#13;
4.22  DMT through the PCU will be responsible for overall Project reporting and will&#13;
provide quarterly progress reports. DMT will also be responsible for the preparation of an&#13;
evaluation report on the project's execution and initial operation, which will be annexed&#13;
unedited to the Implementation Completion Report (ICR) to be finalized within six&#13;
months of the closing date of the proposed project.&#13;
E. MONITORING AND SUPERVISION&#13;
4.23  To facilitate control and monitoring, the PCU will maintain a project&#13;
implementation schedule which is being prepared using computerized network software.&#13;
This will enable the PCU to monitor and track project progress in procurement,&#13;
disbursements and implementation, and to take remedial action where necessary.&#13;
4.24  The PIP includes an agreed format of a quarterly progress report, which IDA&#13;
should receive from the PCU on implementation progress of the project. The quarterly&#13;
report will also include port statistics including operational performances of the two ports.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
A set of key performance indicators on improvements in cargo handling capacities and&#13;
operational productivity to be attained during the implementation of the project have been&#13;
agreed with DMT and are included in Annex 6.&#13;
4.25  IDA would monitor project implementation through field visits, implementation&#13;
support missions, reviews of progress reports and consultations with the borrower and the&#13;
two ports. Estimates of timing of IDA missions, areas of focus, skills requirements and&#13;
inputs are outlined in Annex 5. On or around November 30, 1999, the Government would&#13;
convene a mid-term review mission. The objective of the mission would be to review the&#13;
overall status of project implementation, adherence to the implementation plan, and&#13;
determine any required changes in design or implementation arrangements needed to&#13;
ensure achievement of the project's development objectives. Specifically, the review&#13;
meeting would focus on the status of progress in: (i) revise and enact the country's&#13;
maritime legislation; (ii) revise and enact legislation to establish the two ports as separate&#13;
juridical authorities; (iii) establish the minimum return the Government expects the ports&#13;
to generate from their operations; (iv) establish a capital structure for each port authority,&#13;
including the terms and conditions of long-term debt in this structure; and (v) establish a&#13;
policy for the financing of future investments in the port sector.&#13;

5. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
5.1    The ports of Massawa and Assab perform substantially different roles for the&#13;
Eritrean economy:&#13;
Massawa: the port is the land-sea interface for Eritrean overseas trade. The port&#13;
has been used quite extensively for food relief to Northern Ethiopia but transit&#13;
traffic now forms only a small part of total port traffic. The port has little&#13;
competition for Eritrean cargo as both Assab and Port Sudan are very inadequate&#13;
substitutes.&#13;
Assab: the main transit port for Ethiopian trade which handles very little Eritrean&#13;
dry cargo. The oil refinery does supply Eritrea but oil traffic will be little affected&#13;
by the proposed project. The port could be characterized as a revenue and&#13;
employment generating enterprise for the Eritrean economy. While Assab&#13;
presently handles 85 percent of Ethiopia's overseas trade, Djibouti is a potential&#13;
alternative and increasing efforts are being made to improve its links with Ethiopia.&#13;
5.2   These rather different roles have important implications for the distribution of&#13;
benefits generated by the proposed port investments. Such benefits are normally&#13;
distributed between the port operator and the port users. In the case of Assab, many of&#13;
the port user benefits will accrue to the Ethiopian economy and this, together with the&#13;
potential competition from the port of Djibouti, has to be factored into the analysis in&#13;
order to obtain the likely benefits to the Eritrean economy.&#13;
5.3   The proposed investments have been evaluated using standard port appraisal&#13;
methodology and techniques, assessing the implications of port traffic, cargo handling&#13;
rates and berth capacity on berth occupancy, shipping delays and thus user costs. The&#13;
analysis is based on queuing theory with a random arrival pattern for ships and 'Erlang 2'&#13;
distributions for ship service times'. These statistical distributions were validated by&#13;
comparison to the actual arrival and service patterns at the two ports. The costs and&#13;
benefits of the proposed investments are estimated net of indirect taxes and other transfer&#13;
payments. Shadow pricing of unskilled labor and other local costs was not considered&#13;
relevant to the analysis because:&#13;
*  a very high proportion of the costs (almost 90 percent) and all the benefits&#13;
(reduced shipping costs) will be in foreign exchange; and&#13;
*  unskilled labor will form a very small proportion of total construction costs and an&#13;
even smaller proportion of changes in port operating costs, given the type of&#13;
equipment used.&#13;

B. MASSAWA PORT INVESTMENT2&#13;
The Demand for Port Services&#13;
5.4   Traffic at the port of Massawa has undergone very substantial changes since 1994&#13;
with a major decline in food imports and increases in cement and general cargo imports.&#13;
There is an extremely limited database upon which to forecast future traffic and,&#13;
consequently, forecasts must be treated with caution and additional weight given to the&#13;
project sensitivity analysis.&#13;

5.5   In terms of port services, there is relatively little difference in the handling rates for&#13;
bulk and bagged cargo. The important differences are with respect to break bulk and&#13;
container traffic which presently have very low handling productivity at Massawa.&#13;
2 The analysis of the Massawa Port Component is detailed in Annex I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
Operational Impact of Proposed Investments&#13;
5.6   Without a significant increase in effective port capacity, Massawa will not be able&#13;
to handle the base traffic forecast. The total forecast tonnage grows at a relatively modest&#13;
rate but there is a significant shift to containers and general cargo. Berth occupancy will&#13;
be 92 percent in 2000, with very long berthing delays, and 106 percent in 2005, which is&#13;
not feasible (100 percent berth occupancy would theoretically result in an infinite berthing&#13;
delay). Some expansion in port capacity is thus urgently required, if Massawa is to service&#13;
the expanding Eritrean economy.&#13;
5.7   The investment proposed for the port of Massawa can be conceptually considered&#13;
as three distinct and separable components:&#13;
* Clearance and rationalization of cargo handling and storage areas, combined with&#13;
improved handling operations and management;&#13;
* New general cargo handling equipment which will only become fully effective with&#13;
the rationalized cargo working areas; and&#13;
* Repair of berths Nos. 5 &amp; 6, extension of berth 6, deepening of the berth draft to&#13;
12 meter, and the provision of specialized ship-to-shore container handling&#13;
equipment.&#13;
5.8   The expected impact of the investment on cargo handling productivity, berth&#13;
occupancy.and berthing delays is detailed in Table 5.2. The effects of each component are&#13;
assessed sequentially, in order of their cost.&#13;

5.9    The clearance and rationalization of the cargo working areas would allow&#13;
Massawa to handle 2005 traffic but with long berthing delays. Combining this investment&#13;
with new cargo handling equipment would provide adequate port capacity for 2005,&#13;
though with some delays. The extension of Berth No. 6 will reduce delays to very modest&#13;
levels and allow the introduction of specialized container equipment as well as direct&#13;
services by container liner shipping. The berth repairs and extension will, during&#13;
construction, reduce berth capacity and, to minimize the costs to port users, it is essential*&#13;
that the increased productivity from the rationalized cargo handling areas and new&#13;
equipment is obtained as soon as possible.&#13;
Economic Impact of Investments&#13;
Rationalization of Cargo Working Areas: estimated total cost US$1. 80 million&#13;
5.10   The cost of the clearing and rationalizing the cargo working areas is very modest,&#13;
but the impact on cargo handling productivity is significant. The economic returns from&#13;
the investment are thus very substantial: the NPV (12%) is estimated at US$21.7 million,&#13;
and the IRR at 407.8 percent. These very large economic returns are the result of the&#13;
reduction in ship berthing delays; at very high berth occupancy rates, small changes in&#13;
occupancy have an exponential impact on berthing delays.&#13;
General Cargo and Shore Handlling Equipment: estimatedl total cost US$4.70 million&#13;
5.11   The economic returns from the investment are lower than from rationalizing the&#13;
cargo, as berth occupancy will have been reduced by the prior investment. The returns&#13;
are, however, still substantial; the NPV (12%) is estimated at US$10.8 million, and the&#13;
IRR at 61.8 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Berths 5 &amp; 6 and Container Tower Crane: estimated total cost US$17. 65 million&#13;
5.12   The repair and extension of the berths will effectively add another berth and thus&#13;
substantially increase port capacity. The construction will allow the introduction of&#13;
specialized container ship-to-shore handling equipment and the deepening of the draft to&#13;
12 meters will allow Massawa to handle container liner ships. The analysis of the benefits&#13;
from direct liner services is based on the very modest assumption that 25 percent of&#13;
inbound containers will be landed from direct services. The overall economic returns, for&#13;
the period to 2005, are modest; the IRR is estimated at 12 percent, and the NPV(12%) is&#13;
zero.&#13;
5.13   Benefits increase substantially in the later years of the appraisal period (the annual&#13;
rate of return is over 25 percent in 2005) and a longer appraisal period, rather than the use&#13;
of a residual value, would increase estimated returns significantly. Postponing&#13;
implementation of the component is not justified as the increased congestion costs during&#13;
the construction period, when there will only be five operational berths, are greater than&#13;
the increase in benefits from postponement.&#13;
Total Massaiva Investment: estintated total cost US$29.45 million&#13;
5.14  In addition to the specific investments, technical assistance, training and some&#13;
expansion in administrative facilities are also required to achieve the overall improvement&#13;
in port performance. These complementary activities are expected to cost approximately&#13;
US$5.30 million. It is not feasible to assign specific benefits to these inputs and they are&#13;
thus treated as an essential project overhead.&#13;

5.15  Overall, the project generates a high economic rate of return which is not&#13;
unexpected given that, without the investment, the port will become totally congested by&#13;
the year 2005 and Eritrea does not have a satisfactory alternative access to the sea trade.&#13;
5.16  The project also includes an investment of US$1.25 million for pollution and fire&#13;
control. The investment will improve facilities for the discharge of pollutants and for&#13;
combating minor oil spills. In view of the very limited investment and the major&#13;
improvement in environmental protection, this investment is considered very cost-effective&#13;
and fully justified.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
5.17  Port Traffic Levels: The benefits from the proposed improvements are very&#13;
sensitive to the volume and type of commodity handled by the port. The Eritrean&#13;
economy is emerging from a very long period of conflict and major changes may take&#13;
place in the next few years. Consequently, there must be considerable uncertainty&#13;
regarding any precise traffic forecast. The economic returns from both the high and low&#13;
traffic forecasts indicate that, under these alternative scenarios, the investment is still&#13;
justified, Table 5.4.&#13;

5.18  The overall port investment is justified even under the low growth scenario,&#13;
although most benefits are generated by the rationalization of the cargo handling areas.&#13;
Higher growth does not change substantially the overall economic returns but it shifts&#13;
benefits to the Berths 5 &amp; 6 component as, the other investments have a proportionally&#13;
lower impact on port congestion. The apparent anomalies in the results of the individual&#13;
components in the sensitivity analysis (for example, the higher NPV for cargo area&#13;
rationalization under the low growth scenario) are the result of placing a limitation on the&#13;
ship waiting: service time ratio.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
5.19   Project Investmeint Costs: The project is relatively insensitive to plausible&#13;
changes in investment costs. Under the base level estimates, project costs would have to&#13;
increase by over 150 percent to reduce the economic return to 12 percent. Under the low&#13;
growth scenario, a 40 percent increase in project costs would reduce the economic return&#13;
to 12 percent. Such cost escalation is unlikely as the costs of the equipment (30 percent&#13;
of project costs) are known, and detailed engineering studies have been undertaken.&#13;
5.20   Cargo Handling Rates: If the improvements in cargo handling rates are reduced&#13;
to 50 percent of their expected levels, project benefits will be reduced significantly. The&#13;
project is still, however, justified as the addition of the additional berth provides the&#13;
additional capacity required. The economic returns under the base and high growth&#13;
scenarios remain over 30 percent but, under the low traffic scenario, the economic returns&#13;
fall to a rather marginal 12.2 percent. The estimated gains in cargo handling rates at&#13;
Massawa will, however, only bring rates for bulk, bagged and break bulk cargo to levels&#13;
already achieved at Assab and are considered fuilly feasible.&#13;
5.21   Overall Assessment of Project Sensitivity: the proposed project is justified as a&#13;
relatively short-term capacity enhancing investment, irrespective of the traffic scenario.&#13;
Even under the low traffic scenario (considered highly unlikely by the Government and the&#13;
Port Authority), a satisfactory rate of return is generated and it would require almost a 40&#13;
percent increase in project costs to reduce the rate of return to a marginal 12 percent.&#13;
Under the high traffic scenario, additional port capacity would become desirable toward&#13;
the end of the project period, justifying the inclusion of a longer term planning component&#13;
within this project.&#13;
C. ASSAB PORT INVESTMENT3&#13;
The Demand for Port Services&#13;
5.22   Over 95 percent of dry cargo transiting the port are Ethiopian imports or exports.&#13;
Traffic demand is thus determined by the development of the Ethiopian economy and, in&#13;
the longer term, by Ethiopia's development of alternative transit routes4. During the&#13;
period 1994 - 1996, overall port tonnage changed little but there was a major shift from&#13;
food imports to fertilizer and other imports. Economic growth in Ethiopia is still heavily&#13;
dependent on agriculture which, in turn, depends on rainfall. Marked fluctuations in the&#13;
volume and composition in Ethiopian cargo are thus likely until the economy becomes less&#13;
dependent on agriculture. Traffic forecasts have been based on three scenarios for the&#13;
Ethiopian economy, Table 5.5. The most marked change in Assab traffic in recent years&#13;
For more detailed analvsis of the Assab Port Investment, see Anne.N 2&#13;

scale traffic diversion may not be a possibility. In the longer-terii. xvith the development of a more&#13;

deteriorate seriously.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31l -&#13;
has been the growth in containers. Total container traffic has grown from 4,400 TEU in&#13;
19915 to 32,700 TEU in 1996; a container penetration rate of 30 - 40 percent for general&#13;
cargo imports and about 50 percent for exports. Full inter-modal transport to Ethiopia&#13;
has not yet developed and most containers are stripped/stuffed at the port. Inland&#13;
container handling facilities are being planned, in Ethiopia, and inland container movement&#13;
is expected to increase rapidly in the next few years. On the basis of the past growth in&#13;
container traffic, and estimated future overall port traffic, unconstrained container traffic&#13;
would be around 47,000 TEU by 20006.&#13;

Operational Impact of Proposed Investmeiit&#13;
5.23   The traffic forecasts for Assab do not indicate very rapid growth in total traffic,&#13;
average annual growth of only about 2.7 percent from 1995 levels. There will be,&#13;
however, a substantial shift from bulk and bagged cargo to containers and break bulk&#13;

In 1990. container traffic was 8.400 TEU.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
general cargo. This shift in traffic will have important implications as the handling&#13;
productivity is high for bulk and bagged cargo, but low for break bulk cargo and&#13;
containers, Table 5.6.&#13;
Table 5.6 - Assab Port: Cargo Handling Productivity&#13;
(tonnes per berth hour)&#13;
Cargo Type           1994          1995&#13;
Bulk                 60.4           67.5&#13;
Bagged               46.7           59.2&#13;

Break-Bulk           13.2           16.5&#13;
5.24 Unless cargo handling productivity is further increased, berth occupancy will reach&#13;
89 percent by 2000 and serious berthing delays will be experienced. Assab has no&#13;
specialized ship-to-shore container handling facilities and containers are either handled by&#13;
the heavy mobile crane or, more frequently, by the ship's own gear. Container handling&#13;
productivity is, therefore, very low at 4 - 5 TEUlhour. The proposed investment in&#13;
container handling equipment and introduction of modem container management systems&#13;
is designed to:&#13;
* raise substantially container handling rates, from about 4 to 15 TEU/hour;&#13;
- reduce the berth time for container ships, and thus reduce overall berth occupancy;&#13;
and&#13;
* reduce average ship berthing delays, through the reduction in berth occupancy.&#13;
5.25  The investment is thus both capacity and quality enhancing. Through the&#13;
introduction of the equipment, the overall berth occupancy rate for 2000 is expected to be&#13;
reduced to 75 percent, Table 5.7.&#13;
Table 5.7 - Assab Port: Project Impact on Operations in 2000&#13;

With Project      1,915          75%          421           2,336&#13;
5.26 Berth occupancy will remain relatively high, and new berth capacity must be&#13;
planned for the near future. Container traffic is at the threshold for direct container liner&#13;
services, but such services are unlikely until handling productivity is substantially increased&#13;
and potential berthing delays reduced. The investment has thus, to some extent, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33&#13;
nature of a short-term emergency measure, until additional container berth capacity is&#13;
provided. None of the equipment will become redundant, however, with the provision of&#13;
specialized container berths.&#13;
5.27  While berth occupancy is the primary source of ship delays, ships wait 20 hours&#13;
longer for a berth than is theoretically expected. Inadequate tug capacity (both the&#13;
number and pulling power) combined with the high prevailing winds, during the period&#13;
October - May, is a major factor in these additional delays, although poor communications&#13;
are also a contributing factor. The project will provide Assab with an additional powerful&#13;
tug and this should substantially reduce the delays presently caused by inadequate tug&#13;
capacity.&#13;
Economic Impact of lnvestment&#13;
Potential Economic Returns on Container Handlling Equipment&#13;
5.28  If project benefits are calculated using the conventional methodology for port&#13;
projects, the returns from the investment are extremely high. Based on expected&#13;
reductions in ship berth time and berthing delays, port user costs will be reduced by almost&#13;
US$9.0 million in 2000. This must be compared with the component cost of US$1 1.1&#13;
million (US$10.6 million for equipment and US$0.5 million for associated technical&#13;
assistance to improve operating systems). Even if it assumed that benefits remain constant&#13;
thereafter, an economic return of over 50 percent is generated, Table 5.8.&#13;

5.29   The overall analysis is estimated on the basis of investment in 1998 and full&#13;
benefits being achieved in 2000. It is assumed that additional berth capacity will be&#13;
completed by the beginning of 2003. The potential value to port users of a switch from&#13;
container feeder services to direct liner services has not been estimated, as the extent and&#13;
timing of such a change is too uncertain.&#13;
Economtc Return to Eritrea from Equipment Component&#13;
5.30   The economic returns, estimated above, are based on benefits to port users and&#13;
assumes that Assab will handle the projected flow of traffic, even without additional&#13;
handling equipment. However, changes in port user costs will largely benefit Ethiopia,&#13;
although changes in port pricing could transfer some of the benefits to Eritrea. More&#13;
problematic is whether Assab would, in fact, handle the forecast levels of traffic, without&#13;
investment:&#13;
(a)    Djibouti is not an attractive alternative for bulk and bagged cargo, but it&#13;
has a well equipped and under-utilized container terminal. Severe&#13;
congestion at Assab could result in container diversion, although this&#13;
would only be possible with a major improvement in the road transport&#13;
system between Ethiopia and Djibouti.&#13;
(b)   It is unlikely that the port of Assab would be able to handle 47,000 TEU,&#13;
even at present service levels, without additional container handling&#13;
equipment. Conventional terminal planning parameters indicate that Assab&#13;
should have a capacity of about 28,000 TEU, but the port handled almost&#13;
O &amp; M costs are overstated as they do not take into account the niniiig costs of equipimienit which&#13;
would have been used without the investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
33,000 TEU in 1996. It is very doubtful, however, whether the port could&#13;
handle the 40 percent growth forecast for 2000, without investment.&#13;
5.31  The overall rate of return for the Eritrean economy will depend partly on the&#13;
potential level of diversion to Djibouti, if no investment is made at Assab, and partly on&#13;
decisions on raising port charges on containers, to reflect the improved level of service. It&#13;
is clear, however, that adequate returns for the Eritrean economy can be generated, Table&#13;
5.9. An increase in port charges of US$25/TEU (about 10 percent of existing rates)&#13;
would be sufficient to generate a 12 percent return on the investment, even if Assab could&#13;
handle as many as 42,500 TEU, without any investment.&#13;
Table 5.9 - Port of Assab: Potential Economic Rates to Eritrea&#13;

42,500           2.6%           8.5%            12.5%&#13;
5.32  The realistic commercial capacity of Assab is probably in the range 37,500 -&#13;
40,000 TEU, beyond which shippers would use alternative routes. An economic rate of&#13;
return for the Eritrean economy of at least 15 percent could be easily generated.&#13;
Economic Return on thte Environmental Protection Contponent&#13;
5.33  The project includes an investment of US$0.8 million for pollution control&#13;
equipment, mainly for combating minor oil spills. Assab handles a substantial flow of both&#13;
crude oil and refined products, and the investment is considered very cost-effective and&#13;
fully justified on environmental grounds.&#13;
Econontic Return on thte Tug Component&#13;
5.34  The present inadequate level of tug capacity raises considerable problems for&#13;
vessels above 5,000 GRT. Particularly vulnerable to the strong winds (28 - 40 knots&#13;
during October - May) are the crude oil tankers, half laden bulk carriers, and car carriers.&#13;
The US$3.35 million investment in a tugboat of 2,000-2,400 BP is considered to be fully&#13;
justified on both safety and environmental grounds. The pollution control equipment&#13;
provided under the project could not handle a major incident with a crude oil carrier.&#13;
5.35  The tug investment will not only provide much needed security for the port but&#13;
will also assist in reducing berthing delays and thus port user costs. Without the required&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36&#13;
tug capacity, larger vessels often have to wait for winds to diminish before berthing.&#13;
Unfortunately the port authority does not keep the detailed records necessary to assess the&#13;
precise potential reduction in berthing delay. Average berthing delays are, however, 20&#13;
hours higher than can be explained by berth occupancy. The tug would be economically&#13;
justified, if this 'unexplained' berthing delay was reduced by 25 percent (i.e. an average 5&#13;
hours per vessel) with an economic rate of return of 1 1.8 percent. If the 'unexplained'&#13;
berthing delay was reduced by 50 percent, to 10 hours per vessel, the economic rate of&#13;
return on the tug component would rise to almost 32 percent.&#13;
5.36   Assab Port management considers that a realistic estimate of the reduction will lie&#13;
somewhere between these two estimates: the economic rate of return from a 7.5 hour&#13;
reduction in berthing delays is 22.4 percent, with an NPV (12%) of US$1.77 million.&#13;
Sensitivity Analysis for Container Handling&#13;
5.37  On the basis of the central forecasts of traffic and cargo handling rates, the&#13;
investment generates a high rate of return as a short-term measure before additional berth&#13;
capacity is constructed. The sensitivity of the economic feasibility of the project was&#13;
assessed by testing the analysis to the following changes in the underlying parameters:&#13;
(a)    Port traffic: at high rates of berth occupancy, relatively small changes in&#13;
port traffic have significant impacts on berthing delays and thus overall port&#13;
user costs; and&#13;
(b)   Cargo handling rates: the cargo handling rates for the new container&#13;
equipment have been estimated on an extremely conservative basis (50&#13;
percent of the potential). Much less certain are the cargo handling rates for&#13;
other cargo categories and these will substantially affect overall berth&#13;
occupancy and delays. To test the sensitivity the central rates were varied&#13;
by +1- 15 percent.&#13;
5.38   Over 95 percent of the investment is for standard container handling equipment;&#13;
the cost of this equipment is well known and, consequently, such costs were not included&#13;
in the sensitivity testing, Table 5.10.&#13;

5.39  The investment appears less than justified with high cargo handling rates, although&#13;
it is still essential under the optimistic traffic scenario. The investment appears particularly&#13;
unattractive with a combination of high cargo handling rates and pessimistic traffic&#13;
growth. Berth occupancy under this scenario would be reduced to 63 percent by the&#13;
project and the investment would allow the creation of a dedicated container facility&#13;
without any investment in berth capacity. The substantially improved container handling&#13;
productivity, combined with very low berthing delays and total container traffic of over&#13;
33,000 TEU would very probably result in the introduction of direct container liner calls&#13;
with potential benefits of US$500/TEU. Overall the investment generates high returns for&#13;
both the port and the port user and continues to be justified under much less favorable&#13;
scenarios;&#13;
D. OVERALL PROJECT ECONOMIC RETURNS&#13;
5.40  The economic returns for the overall project, including investments at both&#13;
Massawa and Assab, are very high and fully justify the project, Table 5. 1 1.&#13;
Table 5.11 - Eritrean Ports Project: Ecoitomic Returns&#13;

5.41  The investment generates an overall economic rate of return of 45 percent and a&#13;
net present value of US$43 million.&#13;
5.42  Given the nature of the proposed investment, with a high equipment component,&#13;
and the high rates of return, the project's economic feasibility is insensitive to any plausible&#13;
increase in project costs. The project is, however, sensitive to the rate of growth in port&#13;
traffic. If the low traffic forecasts were to materialize and the additional tug at Assab only&#13;
reduced average berthing delays by 5 hours, the economic returns would be reduced&#13;
substantially, but would still justify the investment, Table 5. 12.&#13;

5.43  Even with the pessimistic assumptions for both the Ethiopian and Eritrean&#13;
economies, the overall project generates an economic rate of return of over 17 percent.&#13;
As the performance of the two economies are not perfectly correlated, this pessimistic&#13;
scenario is unlikely. Overall, the Eritrean Ports Project should be considered as having a&#13;
high and robust economic return.&#13;
5.44  In addition to the sensitivity analysis, the project was also subjected to formal&#13;
'Monte Carlo' risk analysis, with 10,000 simulation iterations. The details of this risk&#13;
analysis, together with distribution of the results, are provided in Annex 15. The overall&#13;
project generates an expected economic rate of return of 48 percent, and there is less than&#13;
a 10 percent probability that the rate of return will fall below 30 percent.&#13;

6. FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
A. SECTOR FINANCIAL ISSUES&#13;
6.1   Tariffs and Costing System: The current structure and levels of tariffs for ship&#13;
services and cargo handling were established in May 1993. Both MPA and APA apply&#13;
the same tariffs, which are quoted in US dollars. Eritrean and Ethiopian nationals and&#13;
ships can make payments in Birr, while others are required to pay in hard currency; it is&#13;
estimated that about 40 percent of the port revenues are paid in hard currency.&#13;
6.2   The level and structure of tariffs are based on APA's operational costing system,&#13;
which was developed in 1987 with financing under a World Bank Credit. According to&#13;
APA, its operational costing system captures most of its operating costs, including the&#13;
depreciation charges of its operational fixed assets at replacement cost. Although APA&#13;
has carried out asset revaluation and implements an operational costing system, MPA has&#13;
not conducted an asset evaluation and does not have a costing system. APA has not&#13;
applied the re-valued assets in its financial statements. Since MPA and APA differ in&#13;
revenue pattern, cost structure and level of capital investment, MPA may need to&#13;
establish its own tariffs under the new institutional setup. Assistance for tariff reviews&#13;
and asset revaluation for MPA and APA is to be provided under the project.&#13;
6.3   Audit: The Audit Service Corporation has recently completed the auditing of&#13;
APA's accounts for 1994 and 1995, and will complete the 1992 to 1995 accounts for&#13;
MPA during the first quarter of 1998. It is estimated that the audit of MPA's and APA's&#13;
accounts for 1996 will be completed by June 30, 1998. During project implementation,&#13;
financial statements, project accounts, special accounts and statements of expenditures for&#13;
the project as well as for MPA and APA will be audited in accordance with International&#13;
Standards of Auditing by independent auditors acceptable to the Government and IDA,&#13;
and will be submitted to the IDA within six months from the closing of the financial year.&#13;
6.4   Future Financial Restructuring of Port Authorities: The Government's&#13;
policy, as outlined in the Letter of Sector Policy (Annex 4), is to develop a framework for&#13;
the efficient commercial management and operation of the ports of Assab and Massawa.&#13;
To implement this policy, the Governent plans to take the following measures:&#13;
(i)   enact legislation to re-establish the port authorities as separate&#13;
juridical and commercially autonomous enterprises;&#13;
(ii)   define a capital structure and set overall financial performance&#13;
goals for the re-established entities; these measures would set, in&#13;
effect, the financial terms and conditions under which the existing&#13;
capital employed in the ports would be inherited by the new&#13;
entities; and&#13;
(iii)  establish the terms and conditions under which the Government&#13;
would provide financing for investments by the ports in the future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
During negotiations, it was confirmed that, consistent with the above performance&#13;
fiamework, all IDA financing under this project would be on-lent to the ports on&#13;
commercial terms.&#13;
6.5   The implementation of the measures envisage by the Government would require&#13;
substantial preparatory work including: (a) confmrmation of the existing assets and&#13;
liabilities of the ports; (b) revaluation of the fixed assets of the ports to set an appropriate&#13;
economic measure of the value of capital employed by the entities; (c) assessments of the&#13;
performance potential of the ports authorities given evolving competitive conditions and&#13;
their plans for investments, training and modernization of their business planning and&#13;
control systems. Much of this preparatory work is already under way and would be&#13;
further supported by assistance to be provided under the project. The Government has&#13;
confirmed in the Letter of Port Sector Policy (Annex 4) that all the required activities&#13;
would be completed by December 31, 1999, and that the policy framework, including the&#13;
terms and conditions for on-lending IDA funds (among other resources), would also be in&#13;
place by that date.&#13;
B. PORT OF MASSAWA&#13;
Financial Performance of the Massawa Port Administration during 1992-19%&#13;
6.6   MPA's summary financial performance for 1992-96 is as follows; detailed&#13;
financial statements are in Annex 11:&#13;
............ . .                             .......... ...., &#13;

6.7   Revenues and Operating Margin: MPA's revenue and operating margin have&#13;
been steadily increasing. From 1993 to 1994, MPA's revenue increased by 80 percent&#13;
from Birr 35.6 million to Birr 64.5 million because of the over 90 percent increase in&#13;
cargo volume (mainly due to a surge of aid cargo). For the period of 1995 and 1996, the&#13;
annual revenue amounted to some Birr 50 million, which seems to be the intrinsic level&#13;
for MPA.&#13;
6.8   Over the past five years, cargo handling charges accounted for over 45 percent of&#13;
total revenue, followed by storage penalty (20 percent) and equipment hire (15 percent).&#13;
6.9   Over the period 1993-96, MPA's operating margin (which equals its profits, since&#13;
MPA has no debt service obligations) increased 60 percent from Birr 18.7 million to Birr&#13;
30.8 million. Its profit margin has been consistent at around 50-60 percent throughout&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
the period 1993-96. The return on MPA's total assets (on historical cost basis) were 13&#13;
percent for the same period except for 1994.&#13;
6.10 Profitability and Financial Viability: Although MPA shows a high financial&#13;
surplus, its financial viability needs further review. First, salary, wages and benefits,&#13;
which amount to some 50 percent of total operating expenses, have long been suppressed.&#13;
A major revision of pay scale for the Government and parastatals is expected for 1998&#13;
and MPA's expenses on salaries, wages and benefits are expected to increase by at least&#13;
20 percent once the new scale is introduced. Its annual depreciation charges, which&#13;
account for approximately 30 percent of operating expenditures, are significantly&#13;
understated. The depreciation charges are based on historical costs of fixed assets and,&#13;
unlike APA (see APA financial performance), a revaluation of replaceable assets has not&#13;
been carried out. A significant portion of MPA's operational equipment has exceeded its&#13;
operational life, and replacement or major rehabilitation of its assets are urgently&#13;
required. Under the proposed project, an asset revaluation is to be carried out and the&#13;
results will be reflected in MPA's financial reporting during project implementation. A&#13;
committee has been established and started its work in late 1997. The asset revaluation&#13;
exercise will be completed by June 30, 1998.&#13;
6.11   Assets and Capital Structure: MPA's total assets were Birr 244 million at end-&#13;
1996, based on historical costs. MPA's fixed asset value is understated; it is based on&#13;
historical costs and most of its replaceable assets are old and fully depreciated. Its current&#13;
assets amount to Birr 182 million, some 75 percent of the total assets, because of the&#13;
extremely high outstanding balance of accounts receivable (Birr 98 million). MPA is&#13;
currently in the process of reducing the outstanding balance of its accounts receivable and&#13;
branch account to around 12 months equivalent by June 30, 1998 and 4 months&#13;
equivalent by end-1998 and thereafter. MPA does not have any long-term debt since&#13;
Ethiopia took over all debts incurred prior to 1991. Its state and donated capital of Birr&#13;
116 million, accumulated profits of Birr 118 million, and a small balance of current&#13;
liability (Birr 10 million) comprise MPA's capital structure.&#13;
Projections of Financial Performance of MPA&#13;
6.12 MPA's financial performance is tentatively projected from 1998 to 2005, based on&#13;
the assumptions used in the economic analysis. MPA's projected financial statements&#13;
and assumptions are in Annex 12 and are summarized as below:&#13;

.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ .....&#13;
6.13  MPA would be able to continue to generate strong cash flows throughout the&#13;
project period to finance anticipated capital expenditures and any debt service obligations&#13;
arising from funds on-lent under the project. However, its profit margin will decline&#13;
because the revenue growth will be reduced by the reduction in berthing time and cargo&#13;
dwell time, while the expenses, including,wages and salaries and annual depreciation&#13;
charges, are expected to increase. Assuming that the IDA Credit is wholly on-lent to it,&#13;
MPA's financial leverage (debt to total assets) is projected to increase to some 14 percent&#13;
once the investments under the Project are initiated. With effect from December 31, 1999&#13;
and throughout the project period, MPA will be required to generate at a minimum&#13;
revenues that cover working capital requirements and its debt service obligations.&#13;
C. PORT OF ASSAB&#13;
Financial Performance of Assab Port Administration (APA) during 1991 -1996&#13;
6.14  APA's summary financial performance for 1991-1996 is as follows; detailed&#13;
financial statements are in Annex 13:&#13;
Revenues (Birrmnillion)       22    119    176   152    155   195&#13;

. X..."-"'-   P~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~......&#13;
6.15 Revenues and Operating Margin: APA's revenue has been fluctuating in the&#13;
range between Birr 150 and 200 million during 1993-96: Bir 176 million for 1993, Bi5&#13;
152 million for 1994; Birr 155 million for 1995 and Birr 195 million for 1996. The&#13;
fluctuation is due to changes in traffic volume and the revision of tariffs. APA's total dry&#13;
cargo traffic volumes were 1.2 million tonsAfor 19  1 in tons for 1993, 1.3&#13;
million tons for 1994, 1.4 million tons for 1995 and 1.3 million tons for 1996. Tariffs&#13;
were reduced for Eritrean cargoes in May 1993 and for Ethiopian cargoes in mid-1994.&#13;
6.16 Among all the revenue items, cargo handling charges are the dominant source of&#13;
revenue, amounting to over 50 percent of total revenue; storage penalties comprised some&#13;
14 percent, and equipment hire was 16 percent for 1994-96.&#13;
6.17 APA's profit margin has been high, although it has been slightly reduced since the&#13;
revision of tariffs in 1993 and 1994. APA's operating margins were around 70 percent&#13;
during 1992-96. Returns on assets were 39 percent for 1992, 38 percent for 1993, 22&#13;
percent for 1994, 18 percent for 1995 and 20 percent for 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
6.18 Assets and Capital Structure: APA's current assets are inflated by a high&#13;
outstanding balance of accounts receivable and inter-office receivable accounts (Birr 41&#13;
million and Birr 527 million, respectively, at end-December 1996) amounting to 80&#13;
percent of its total asset value. A significant portion of the accounts receivable was&#13;
accumulated during the period right after independence and is mostly owed by ERSTAS,&#13;
which collects shipping and cargo handling charges on behalf of APA. Because the&#13;
country's banks lacked proper bank correspondence agreements with international banks&#13;
at the time of independence, the Ministry of Finance established a liaison office for&#13;
ERSTAS in Italy to receive deposits for shipping charges from shipping lines. The&#13;
charges collected by the liaison office were finally transferred to APA in late 1997. APA&#13;
is presently in the process of reducing the outstanding balance of its accounts receivable&#13;
to around 12 months by June 30, 1998 and 4 months by end-1998 and thereafter.&#13;
6.19 APA's fixed asset value is understated in its financial statements; however, its&#13;
replaceable assets in operation have been re-valued at replacement cost during the past&#13;
tariff revisions. The total book value of its fixed assets (before depreciation) was Birr&#13;
186 million as of end-December 1996. At replacement cost, its fixed assets could be&#13;
worth more than Birr 700 million before depreciation; for example, major infrastructure,&#13;
including the breakwater and jetties, is estimated at some Birr 340 million, compared&#13;
with the historical cost of Birr 21 million; tug boats and pilot boats are estimated at Binr&#13;
54 million, vis-a-vis Birr 13 million at historical cost; and port equipment, which includes&#13;
shore cranes, mobile cranes, lift trucks, trailers and grain handling equipment, is&#13;
estimated to cost Birr 200 million at replacement cost, compared with Biff 49 million at&#13;
historical cost.&#13;
6.20 APA has no outstanding balance of loans since all past debt service obligations&#13;
prior to independence were taken over by Ethiopia. Ninety nine percent of its total assets&#13;
(Birr 711 million) is financed by capital contributions from the Government and donors&#13;
and its accumulated profits.&#13;
6.21   Expenditures and Financial Sustainability: Although APA's current financial&#13;
profitability seems to be sustainable by the continuing implementation of cost-based&#13;
tariffs and its costing system, its future financial sustainability still requires further&#13;
review.&#13;
6.22 First, APA's salaries, wages and benefits, which amount to some 60 percent of&#13;
total operating expenses, have long been suppressed. A major revision on pay scale for&#13;
the Government and parastatals is expected for 1998 and APA's expenses on salaries,&#13;
wages and benefits are expected to increase by at least 20 percent once the new scale is&#13;
introduced.&#13;
6.23   Second, since APA's fixed asset value is understated in its financial statements,&#13;
its annual depreciation charges do not reflect real capital requirements for replacement of&#13;
its operational assets. Since APA has carried out a revision of the tariff, including&#13;
revaluation of its operational fixed assets, annual depreciation charges of its replaceable&#13;
operational fixed assets at replacement cost would be reflected in its financial reporting&#13;
and be monitored during project implementation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44-&#13;
6.24   Third, the current costing system does not necessarily reflect the costs of APA's&#13;
future capital investments in timely manner. APA's major future capital investments&#13;
would be incorporated into the tariff revision schedule.&#13;
Projections of Financial Performance of APA&#13;
6.25   APA's financial performance is tentatively projected from 1998 to 2003, based on&#13;
the assumptions used in the economic analysis. APA's projected financial statements and&#13;
assumptions are in Annex 14 and are summarized as below:&#13;
...~~ ~~~~~~~~~~         ...........  .....&#13;

6.26 APA would be able to continue to generate strong cash flows for its investments,&#13;
replacement of existing infrastructure and debt service obligations throughout the project&#13;
period. However, its profit margin will decline because revenue growth will be reduced&#13;
by the reduction in berthing time and cargo dwelling time, and the expenses, including&#13;
wages and salaries and annual depreciation charges, are expected to increase. Contrary to&#13;
MPA, APA's debt equity ratio will remain low, in the range of 10% to 13%. With effect&#13;
from January 1, 1999 and throughout the project period, APA will be required to generate&#13;
at a minimum revenues sufficient to cover working capital requirements and its debt&#13;
service obligations.&#13;

7. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT, PROJECT&#13;
SUSTAINABILITY AND RISK&#13;
A. ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
7.1   The project is rated "A" as it comprises dredging and reclamation of some&#13;
50,000m3 in front of berth 6, and handling of potentially hazardous material. The&#13;
environmental impact assessment, however, revealed that the material to be dredged is&#13;
free from contamination, and is suitable for the land reclamation required behind berth 6.&#13;
Final design and bidding documents for the rehabilitation of berths 5 and 6 will ensure that&#13;
appropriate measures are taken by the contractor to mitigate potential adverse&#13;
environmental impact of the dredging activities, including disposal of dredged material. A&#13;
summary of the environmental assessment is attached in Annex 10. In light of the&#13;
regulations stipulated under the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution&#13;
from Ships (MARPOL 73/78), a review has been carried out of the port of Massawa's&#13;
operating practice regarding control of discharge of pollutants in the port, including oily&#13;
ballast, bilge water and sewage, as well as their contingency plans in case of oil spillage&#13;
and fire. The review has assessed what kind of facilities and operating adjustments that&#13;
would be required for Eritrea to sign and ratify the MARPOL Convention.&#13;
Environmental Impacts During Construction&#13;
7.2   The project is expected to have a neutral impact on the environment. The project&#13;
includes repairs and realignment of Berths 5 and 6, dredging of material in a turning basin&#13;
outside the rehabilitated Berth 6, and reclamation of land behind the rehabilitated Berth 6.&#13;
The principal environmental impacts and the mitigation proposed are outlined below:&#13;
*  The realignment of Berths 5 and 6 is assumed to lead to a slight increase in&#13;
water circulation within the port and may therefore have a minor positive&#13;
impact on the marine environment.&#13;
*  Construction of Berths 5 and 6 (sheet pile installation etc.) will cause minor&#13;
temporary impacts. These, however, are not considered serious and will not&#13;
cause lasting damage to the marine environment.&#13;
*  The project includes dredging of approximately 50,000m3'. Analysis of the&#13;
material to be dredged has shown that it is suitable for r eclamation purposes,&#13;
and free from contamination of heavy metals. The dredged material will be&#13;
used for reclamation of land behind the extension of Berth 6.&#13;
7.3   In order to reduce the impact of dredging and reclamation the following working&#13;
methods will be adhered to:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46-&#13;
*  Dredging works shall be carried out by suitable equipment, i.e. a cutter&#13;
suction dredger.&#13;
*  Dredging and reclamation will be carried out after the sheet pile wall has been&#13;
installed in front of the lagoon to be reclaimed, thereby creating a closed basin&#13;
where sedimentation can take place. The content of solid material shall be&#13;
below 2-3 % before water is let back to the harbor/sea.&#13;
*  A survey of unexploded ordnances in the area to be dredged shall be&#13;
performed before the works start.&#13;
7.4   Some 40 port staff (ex-fighters) who were given shelter in the port after the&#13;
Liberation War, as well as a number of staff from the Customs Authority and the&#13;
Ministries of Finance and Health (about 120 people in total), were during the preparation&#13;
of the project living in government-owned houses in the port of Massawa. Both the Port&#13;
and the Massawa Municipal Authority had already determined that for safety and security&#13;
reasons no-one should be living within the port boundaries. Steps have therefore been&#13;
taken through the DMT and the Municipality of Massawa to ensure alternative&#13;
accommodation for these people, with houses being set aside for them in new housing&#13;
developments. As of September 1997 suitable alternative accommodation had been&#13;
arranged for 90 people; the remaining 30 will be housed before the end of November,&#13;
1997.&#13;
Treatment of Hazardous and Noxious Cargo&#13;
7.5   The port has very limited facilities and guidelines for handling and storage of&#13;
hazardous and noxious cargo. Under the project the ports will set new procedures and&#13;
elaborate on emergency plans in case of accidents. The procedures to be introduced will&#13;
be based on IMO guidelines.&#13;
Handling of Ships Waste&#13;
7.6   Facilities in the two ports for collection, storage, and treatment of ship's waste are&#13;
very limited. Oily waste is collected only from the ports own tug boats. The oily waste&#13;
from these vessels is stored in a small tank truck until it is full, when the waste is dumped&#13;
outside the port area. For all other vessels calling at the two ports there are no facilities&#13;
offered to discharge oily waste. The two ports' operational practices regarding control of&#13;
discharge of pollutants, including collection of garbage and oily ballast, bilge water and&#13;
sewage, will be improved under the project as a first step for Eritrea to eventually sign and&#13;
ratify the MARPOL 73/78 Convention.&#13;
National Oil Spill Contingency Plan&#13;
7.7   Eritrea has decided to develop and implement a National Oil Spill Response Plan in&#13;
conjunction with the local and international oil industry. This plan will:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-47-&#13;
*  assess the risk of oil spills from all sources that could threaten the coastline&#13;
and its associated islands and coral reefs;&#13;
*  identify sensitive areas, socio-economic as well as environmental, that would&#13;
need protection; and&#13;
*  develop response strategies suitable for the region.&#13;
7.8   The project will provide funds to finance equipment needs consistent with the&#13;
response strategies, and to finance training programs for oil spill contingency planners and&#13;
responders. In developing the component DMT, will work closely with the IMO and with&#13;
the International Petroleum Industry Environmental Conservation Association (IPIECA)&#13;
and benefit from their expertise in the field. The marine environment pollution prevention&#13;
assessment for Eritrea is part of a larger study on navigation risk assessment and plan for&#13;
the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, to be funded under a Norwegian Trust Fund.&#13;
Maritime Safety&#13;
7.9   Assab is very exposed to winds; the area is heavily influenced by the north east&#13;
monsoons in the Indian Ocean, particularly during the winter months of October to may&#13;
when winds reach Beaufort Force 7 (28 to 33 knots) and frequently Force 8 (34 - 40&#13;
knots). During berthing and unberthing, vessels must rely almost entirely on the tugs to&#13;
counteract the wind effect.&#13;
7.10  The port has presently two tug boats, one in a reasonably good condition (built&#13;
1987 - 1,600 HP), and one in very poor condition (built 1980 - 1,400 HP). The shortage&#13;
of adequate tug services is increasingly causing great concern regarding safe ship handling&#13;
in the port, particularly during berthing/unberthing of crude oil tankers to the mooring&#13;
buoy, and to the oil jetties for refined products.&#13;
7.11   To arrange for the minimum requirement of 2 suitable tug boats, and for adequate&#13;
bollard pull requirement and safe ship handling, the project will provide for an additional&#13;
powerful tugboat of around 2,000 to 2,400 HP.&#13;
B. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
7.12  The Government's commitment in the Letter of Port Sector Policy would ensure&#13;
adequate tariffs and cost containment measures to maintain port profitability and&#13;
competitiveness with comparable ports in the region. Restructuring of the ports, the&#13;
provision of training and TA and placing them within a commercial framework will&#13;
enhance project sustainability.&#13;
C. PROJECT RISK&#13;
7.13  During implementation of the civil works component (a period of about two&#13;
years), berths 5 and 6 in Massawa will at different times be out of commission and handed&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-48-&#13;
over to the civil contractor. There is a risk during this time that the port area will be so&#13;
heavily congested that the contractor's work will be hampered. To minimize the risk of&#13;
delays and cost escalation of the civil works, the bidding/contract document(s) will include&#13;
specific and detailed clauses on phasing of the works, and modalities for coordination and&#13;
liaison between the contractor and the operations department. There are also risks and&#13;
uncertainty as to the local capacity and lack of experience of DMT and the two ports to&#13;
implement and manage the project. Flexible overall project design, the early establishment&#13;
of a Project Coordination Unit, technical assistance and training, and frequent project&#13;
supervision and reviews have been included to manage these risks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-49-&#13;
8. AGREEMENTS AND RECOMMENDATION&#13;
A. AGREEMENTS REACHED DURING NEGOTIATIONS&#13;
8.1   At negotiations, agreement was reached on:&#13;

2.    Forecasting future traffic flows through the port of Massawa on the basis of&#13;
precise statistical trends and relationships is not possible and the forecasts should be&#13;
treated with due caution:&#13;
*  The statistical database for the Eritrean economy is still rudimentary; for example,&#13;
there are still no national income accounts nor sectoral estimates of GDP;&#13;
*  The economy is very small and is recovering from many years of civil war. Given&#13;
the small size of the economic base, change can be rapid and the implementation of&#13;
a few major projects, such as a large cement factory, would have a major impact&#13;
on port traffic;&#13;
*  A large proportion of port traffic has traditionally been food imports but their level&#13;
varies very substantially with the size of the harvests in Eritrea, Northern Ethiopia&#13;
and Ethiopia generally. In 1992 and 1994, over 350,000 tonnes of basic foodstuffs&#13;
were imported through Massawa, but in 1993 and 1995 food imports fell to&#13;
150,000 tonnes and to 120,000 tonnes in 1996. However, neither the 1995 nor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -                             ANNEX 1&#13;
Page 2 of 11&#13;
1996 harvests in Eritrea were good and it is assumed that food was imported from&#13;
Ethiopia rather than from overseas;&#13;
The substantial proportion of Eritrea's foreign exchange is derived from aid and&#13;
remittances from Eritreans living abroad; visible export earnings are very limited.&#13;
The levels of both these foreign exchange sources may fluctuate significantly.&#13;
The traffic forecasts, made by consultants in 19941 based on 1992-94 flows, require major&#13;
re-assessment to take into account the impact of (i) the continuing decline in food imports;&#13;
and (ii) the major increases in cement and general cargo imports.&#13;
3.    With the return of stability, marked increases in both GNP and agricultural&#13;
production are expected. These increases will have offsetting effects on port traffic -&#13;
increasing GNP will generate additional imports, while increasing agricultural production&#13;
will reduce the import of basic foods. The central forecasts for the years 2000 and 2005,&#13;
have been based on: (i) annual GNP growth of 7.5 percent to 2000 and 5.0 percent&#13;
thereafter; (ii) population growth rate of 2.7 percent; and (iii) annual agricultural growth&#13;
of 6 percent. The demand for individual commodities is based on forecasts from&#13;
Ministries (for example, demand for cement), and assumed GNP elasticities. Given the&#13;
limited database, traffic forecasts on both high and low income and production&#13;
assumptions were also developed, Table 2.&#13;

4.    Total port traffic is expected, under the central forecast, to rise from 633,000&#13;
tonnes in 1994, to 870,000 tonnes in 2000, and 1,005,000 tonnes in 2005. The proportion&#13;
of grain wiMl fall from 38 percent (1994-1996), to 23 percent in 2000 and 18 percent in&#13;
2005. Very rapid growth in containerized traffic is expected, 15.5 percent annually under&#13;
the central scenario, but from a very low base.&#13;
Cargo Handling Pattern&#13;
5.    The forecast growth in trade will change cargo handling patterns and thus the&#13;
demand for port services. There has already been a major shift in handlng pattems in&#13;
recent years, Table 3.&#13;
Table 3 - Port of Massawa: Cargo Handling Patterns 1994 - 1996&#13;

A large proportion of basic foods (60 percent) will continue to be imported in bulk but&#13;
other basic commodities (sugar and cement) will be imported as bagged cargo. The&#13;
volume of fertilizer is insufficient to justify bulk imports. There is considerable uncertainty&#13;
whether the traffic pattems of 1995-96 reflect a long-term shift in demand or simply the&#13;
reflection of a short-term boom in construction and consumption. Cargo handling patterns&#13;
vary substantially with the forecasts, Table 4.&#13;

Cargo Handling Productivity&#13;
6.    The proposed project is expected to improve cargo handling productivity very&#13;
substantially through the clearance of the cargo working areas, the introduction of&#13;
improved operational practices and the provision of additional handlng equipment. The&#13;
expected cargo handling rates are detailed in Table 4.&#13;

7.    The project will increase handling productivity for all traffic except the Red Sea&#13;
ferries. The project will have its most marked impact on container handling rates, which&#13;
are presently extremely low. The impacts of the expected traffic growth, the proposed&#13;
investments in handling equipment, and the extension to Berth No. 6 on expected berth&#13;
occupancy rates are shown in Table 5.&#13;

8.    While the clearance and rationalization of the cargo handling areas, and the&#13;
provision of additional handling equipment will assist in reducing berth occupancy, they&#13;
are not sufficient to provide the effective port capacity and container handling efficiency&#13;
required. Under the central and high growth scenarios, berth occupancy rates would still&#13;
result in significant ship berthing delays by 2005 (central growth scenario) or 2000 (high&#13;
growth scenario). The extension of Berth 6 will effectively provide the port with an&#13;
additional berth and allow the introduction of high capacity ship-to-shore contaimer&#13;
handling equipment; these will meet capacity needs until, at least, 2005.&#13;
Methodology for Economic Analysis2&#13;
9.    The economic benefits of the proposed investments are derived from: (a) the&#13;
reduced time that ships spend at berth; (b) the reduced time that ships have to wait for a&#13;
berth; and (c) the introduction of some container liner services for existing container&#13;
feeder services. The reduction in berthing time delays are calculated on the basis of&#13;
queuing theory with a random ship arrival pattern and an Erlang 2 distribution for ship&#13;
service times3. The reduced ship berth and berthing time is expected to result im reduced&#13;
freight rates (or avoidance of congestion surcharges) and thus benefit the Eritrean&#13;
economy. The increased container handling productivity of the port, combined with the&#13;
increased flow of containers and the deeper draft at Berth 6, should result in some direct&#13;
container services, replacing the present feeder services from Jeddah and Djibouti. Such&#13;
substitution should result in a substantial fall (in the order of US$500/TEU) in container&#13;
freight rates.&#13;
10.   The economic analysis of the project was undertaken on an incremental basis i.e.&#13;
the economic viability of each individual component was assessed on the basis of its&#13;
incremental costs and benefits. The components were assessed in order of their&#13;
investment cost:&#13;
(i)    Clearance and rationalization of the cargo handlng areas and introduction&#13;
of operational improvements;&#13;
(ii)   Provision of additional handling equipment; and&#13;
(iii)   Repairs to Berths 5 &amp; 6, the extension of berth 6, and deepening the draft&#13;
to 12 meter.&#13;
In the analysis, the ship waiting: service time ratio was limited to 1.0 in order to ensure a&#13;
rather conservative estimate of benefits. The costs of ship delay time were estimated on&#13;
the basis of the following shipping costs:&#13;
2   The economic analysis of the Consultants has been adjusted for: (i) the change in port traffic&#13;
forecasts; (ii) delay in project implementation; (iii) inclusion of berthing delays for cargo area&#13;
rationalization and equipment components; (iv) exclusion of truck waiting time benefits.&#13;
3   The Consultants analyzed past ship arrival and service patters and verified that these distributions&#13;
were appropriate&#13;

The economic retums on the investment are extremely high, as would be expected given&#13;
the very low capital costs and the significant impact on handling productivity. The decline&#13;
in benefits appears counter-intuitive; it results from the upper limit placed on the&#13;

The investment in the additional berth capacity and ship-to-shore container handling&#13;
equipment appears marginal, generating only a 12 percent rate of return. The rate of&#13;
return in the first full year of operation is 9.2 percent (rising to 26.5 percent by 2005) and&#13;
this would suggest the desirability of postponing the investment. Postponement of the&#13;
berth extension would, however, substantially increase costs as one berth has to be closed&#13;
during the construction period, creating additional congestion and berthing delays which&#13;
more than offset the increase in benefits. In view of their impact on port operations during&#13;
the construction period, repairs to Berth No. 5 and extension of Berth No. 6 should be&#13;
completed at the very earliest opportunity.&#13;
(d) Total Massawa Project&#13;
In addition to the specific physical investments, technical assistance, training and some&#13;
investment in administrative buildings will be required. These items are expected to cost&#13;
approximately US$5.3 million and are necessary to achieve the overall improvement in&#13;
port performance and capacity. It is not possible, however, to estimate specific benefits&#13;
for these elements and they are thus treated as a project overhead. The results of the&#13;
overall analysis are detailed in Table 6.&#13;

The total project generates an economic return of 45 percent with a net present value&#13;
(12%) of US$28 million. On the basis of the central traffic forecasts, the proposed&#13;
investments in the Port of Massawa are clearly justified.&#13;
12.    Sensitivity Analysis&#13;
(a) Sensitivity to Traffic Growth&#13;
The economic retums estimated for port investments, when based on berth occupancy and&#13;
berthing delays, are normally very sensitive to traffic growth: shipping delays and thus&#13;
benefits tend to infinity as berth occupancy approaches 100 percent.&#13;
High growth scenario: Berth occupancy would reach 100 percent by 2000 and there&#13;
would be very long shipping delays and some suppression of port traffic. Even with the&#13;
rationalization of the cargo areas and new equipment, berth occupancy in 2005 would be&#13;
over 90 percent and there would still be very substantial average berthing delays. Berth&#13;
occupancy is only brought down to reasonable levels with the extension of Berth No. 6.&#13;
Overall economic benefits would be much higher than under the central growth scenario&#13;
but these are not filly reflected in the economic analysis as an upper limit was imposed on&#13;
the ship waiting:service time ratio, Table 7.&#13;

The overall rate of return is little changed but the return from the major civil works rises&#13;
substantially, indicating the more limited impact of the other investments on relieving the&#13;
overall port congestion.&#13;
Low growth scenario: Lower traffic would result in substantially reduced benefits but it&#13;
is clear from the analysis of berth occupancy that some additional increase in port capacity&#13;
is still required. Despite the lower economic benefits, the overall project still generates an&#13;
acceptable rate of return, Table 8.&#13;

The economic benefits returns are generated primarily by rationalizing the cargo handling&#13;
areas and improving cargo handling productivity.&#13;
Assessment of sensitivity: The project is relatively insensitive to changes in the&#13;
assumptions regarding traffic growth. Economic rates are high for the central growth&#13;
scenario; if growth is higher than the central forecasts, the port will still be able to provide&#13;
adequate service levels; and, if growth is rather lower than the central forecasts, an&#13;
acceptable rate of return is still generated.&#13;
(b) Sensitivity to Project Costs&#13;
13.   The project is also relatively insensitive to plausible changes in project costs:&#13;
Central growth scenario: Project costs would have to increase by rather more than 150&#13;
percent to reduce the economic rate of return to 12 percent.&#13;
Low growth scenario: An increase in project costs of about 40 percent would reduce the&#13;
economic rate of return to 12 percent. A 50 percent increase would reduce the IRR to&#13;
10.7 percent. Such cost increases are very unlikely given: (i) market prices for equipment&#13;
are well known; and (ii) detailed engineering studies and construction costs have been&#13;
prepared for the civil works component.&#13;

(c) Sensitivity to Productivity Assumptions&#13;
14.   Substantial increases in cargo handling productivity are foreseen by the clearance&#13;
of the cargo handling areas and the additional handling equipment. If the productivity&#13;
gains were reduced to 50 percent of the forecast levels, the overall investment would still&#13;
be justified, irrespective of the traffic scenario, Table 9.&#13;

IRR                      12.2%          32.2%        32.1%&#13;
The benefits from the rationalization of the cargo handling areas and investment in&#13;
equipment are reduced. The reduction in these benefits are, however, partially offset by&#13;
increased benefits to the berth repairs and extension as a result of the increased residual&#13;
congestion which would remain after the impact of the other investments.&#13;
(d) Overall Assessment of Sensitivity and Project Risks&#13;
15.   The project generates very high rates of return and is insensitive to plausible&#13;
changes in project parameters. The overall level of economic returns is sensitive to the&#13;
growth in port traffic but, even with low growth and a substantial reduction in&#13;
productivity benefits, the investment is still justified. The Eritrean Ports Authority and the&#13;
Government believe that the central traffic forecast is rather conservative and they expect&#13;
a much faster rate of growth. Though the investment will allow the high traffic forecast to&#13;
be accommodated, the evolution of traffic at Massawa will need to be kept under review&#13;
to ensure that future capacity is provided at the appropriate time.&#13;

PORT OF ASSAB&#13;
Present and Forecast Port Traffic&#13;
1.    The port of Assab is Ethiopia's primary access to the sea, handling about 85&#13;
percent of its total external trade. Ethiopia dominates dry cargo traffic at the port (over&#13;
95 percent). Port traffic increased very substantially in the early 1980's (primarily growth&#13;
in relief cargo but with some increase in commercial cargo), fell significantly in the early&#13;
1990's after the change in regime, and has subsequently recovered to previous levels. Port&#13;
traffics for the last four years are detailed in Table 1.&#13;

Total Dry Cargo      1,046       1,280      1,400      1,331&#13;
2.    Dry cargo traffic handled during 1995 was approximately equal to the maximm&#13;
handled during the 1980's but was achieved without the major congestion previously&#13;
experienced. Improved port performance reflects a shift to direct delivery for bulk and&#13;
bagged commodities, increased inland transport capacity, upgraded storage areas, and&#13;
more efficient port operations.&#13;
3.    Major increases in the total volume of dry cargo traffic are not expected but very&#13;
substantial shifts in the commodity distribution are probable:&#13;
*  the high level of fertilizer imports is expected to continue, even if donor assistance&#13;
is reduced;&#13;
*  grain production in Ethiopia will expand significantly and there will be a gradual&#13;
decline in food imports, although there will still be marked fluctuations in annual&#13;
flows, depending upon rainfll and domestic production;&#13;
*  economic growth in Ethiopia will increase imports of raw materials, vehicles,&#13;
machinery and other general cargo. The growth rate is expected to be&#13;
approximately equal to the growth in GDP, i.e. about 6 percent per annum; and&#13;
*  coffee and other agricultural exports have increased since 1992, and this growth is&#13;
expected to continue.&#13;

4.    The central forecast for traffic through Assab in 2000 is provided in Table 2,&#13;
together with the impact of rather more optimistic and pessimistic scenarios for the&#13;
Ethiopia economy. In terms of port tonnage, both the optimistic and pessimistic forecasts&#13;
could result in higher traffic, but with very different commodity flows:&#13;

5.    The shift in commodity distribution will increase pressure on present port capacity&#13;
as handling productivity for break-bulk cargo is only 25 percent of the rate for bulk and&#13;
bagged commodities.&#13;
Cargo Distribution&#13;
6.    In addition to the changes in commodity distribution, brought about by economic&#13;
growth in Ethiopia, the trend toward containerization is also likely to continue. The&#13;
inward and outward movement of containerized cargo has increased very rapidly since the&#13;
late 1980's, although the pattern was disrupted by the decline in general cargo traffic in&#13;
the early 1990's, Table 3.&#13;

7.    Containerized cargo imported/exported through Assab has doubled since 1993,&#13;
now totaling about 250,000 tonnes, between 30 - 40 percent of non-bulk/bagged traffic.&#13;
8.    Most containers continue to be stripped/stuffed in Assab, but the shift to inland&#13;
container movement can only be a matter of time; the development of inland container&#13;
facilities has high priority within Ethiopia. Containerization has been particularly rapid for&#13;
export traffic, almost all of which is containelizable. This rapid increase in&#13;
containerization is expected to continue, but the total flow will be dependent on the&#13;
pattern of economic growth in Ethiopia, Table 4.&#13;

9.    The central container forecast, for the year 2000, exceeds the likely threshold for&#13;
direct container liner calls but such services are unlikely, unless handling productivity is&#13;
raised substantially. The impact of containerization and the change in the distribution of&#13;
cargo handling is shown in Table 5.&#13;

2  The forecasts are based on 38 percent containerization of non-bulk import dry cargo, and 75 percent&#13;
containerization of exports. Average weight of import TEU assumed at 10.5 tonnes, export TEU&#13;
13.5 tonnes, some containers will remain in Ethiopia and some empty TEUs will be imported to&#13;
balance seasonal shipping line demands.&#13;

10.   Under the pessimistic 2000 scenario, the proportion of bulk and bulk cargo&#13;
remains similar to present levels, otherwise the proportion fails significantly. Under all&#13;
traffic scenarios there is a significant shift to containers, although there is still an absolute&#13;
increase in break-bulk tonnage.&#13;
Shipping Patterns&#13;

12.   There has been a significant increase in the number of container vessels calling at&#13;
Assab, and this has been accompanied by a reduction in the proportion of container&#13;
tonnage carried by multi-purpose ships (primarily Ethiopian Shipping Line) from 41&#13;
percent to 33 percent. Lash shipping is declining, a trend confirmed by the shipping line.&#13;
Handling productivity rose significantly for all cargo categories in 1995 but it is difficult to&#13;
determine the extent to which operational efficiency contributed to this change, rather than&#13;
the increasee in the average consignment size.&#13;
13.   Shipping and handling pattems for the year 2000 are based on the forecast levels&#13;
of traffic detailed in Table 2, and the following assumptions:&#13;
The trend toward specialized container shipping continues, by 2000 it is assumed&#13;
that 75 percent of containers are carried by such vessels;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Lash shipping is phased out by 2000;&#13;
Cargo productivity is equivalent to the 1995 handling rates.&#13;
Bagged cargo accounts for 20 percent of food imports.&#13;
* Ro-Ro shipping maintains its share of the non-bulk market&#13;
On the basis of these assumptions, the shipping and handling patterns for the year 2000 are&#13;
detailed in Table 7.&#13;

14.   Berth occupancy reached 79 percent in 1994 but fell to about 70 percent in 1995&#13;
with increased handling productivity. By 2000, berth occupancy under the base traffic and&#13;
cargo handling scenario would reach 89 percent and extensive berth delays could be&#13;
expected. Without increased handling productivity, the optimistic traffic scenario could&#13;
not be accommodated. Table 8 indicates the sensitivity of 2000 berth occupancy rates to&#13;
both traffic and handling scenarios (high = +15 percent of the central rate; low = -15&#13;
percent or the 1994 rate, whichever is the higher).&#13;

15.   Forecast berth occupancy in 2000 is uniformly high, with the exception of the&#13;
pessimistic traffic combined with high handling productivity. Significant ship berthing&#13;
delays are thus likely and, under some scenarios, traffic will have to divert to other ports.&#13;

Ship Berthing Delays&#13;
16.   Berthing delays are normally modeled on the basis of a random ship arnival pattern&#13;
and a ship service time approximated by an "erlang" distribution. It appears, however,&#13;
that berthing delay times at Assab are significantly higher than the theoretical expectation&#13;
for a port with 7 berths, Table 9.&#13;

17.   There are a number of factors contributing to the higher than expected berthing&#13;
delays:&#13;
*  Berth No. 8 has limited draft and its occupancy is always very low (&lt;10 percent in&#13;
1994); effectively, therefore, Assab has 6 main berths although there is also Berth&#13;
No. 1 lA for smaller Ro-Ro vessels;&#13;
*  The seasonalty of traffic results im very high berth occupancy July - September,&#13;
and low occupancy January - April;&#13;
*  Communication difficulties results in ships waiting at anchor for berthing&#13;
formalhies to be completed; and&#13;
*  Inadequate tug capacity and high prevailing winds, October - May, creates&#13;
berthing delays for larger vessels, as well as creating environmental risks&#13;
18.   The relationship between waiting time and service time at Assab can be explained&#13;
very accurately, however, if it is assumed that:&#13;
(a)   There is an average waiting time per vessel of 20 hours, irrespective of&#13;
berth occupancy; and&#13;
(b)   Assab has only six effective cargo berths.&#13;
The closeness in the correspondence between the actual and expected delays, after taking&#13;
into account these adjustments, is demonstrated in Table 10.&#13;

On the basis of the central traffic forecast, ships will wait, on average, almost four days for&#13;
a berth, when the 20 hour standard waiting delay is included. This average delay may be&#13;
sufficient to divert some traffic, particularly containers, to Djibouti.&#13;
Proposed Project&#13;
20.   To accommodate the forecast traffic without extensive berthing delays, an increase&#13;
in effective berth capacity is required. The provision of additional berths is not feasible&#13;
before 2002 and hence improved cargo handling productivity is the only alternative. A&#13;
total investment in new handling equipment of US$10.60 million is envisaged. It is&#13;
assumed that technical assistance and training, equivalent to US$0.5 million, will be&#13;
required to modify the present container handling systems to take full advantage of the&#13;
new equipment. As in Massawa, the Assab component of the project also includes an&#13;
investment of US$0.8 million in pollution control equipment; primarily to improve&#13;
facilities for the discharge of pollutants and for combating minor oil spills. A new tug,&#13;
costing about US$3.35 million, is also proposed to reduce berthing delays and improve&#13;
berthing safety.&#13;
21.   The project is designed to raise very substantially the level of container handling&#13;
capacity and productivity through the provision of:&#13;
* ship-to-shore tower cranes (US$6.0 million)&#13;
* reach stackers (US$2.3 million)&#13;
* tugmasters and trailers (US$1.35 million)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;

. small forklifts (US$0.55 million)&#13;
* mobile crane (US$0.4 million)&#13;
While this equipment will primarily increase container handling rates, the increased number&#13;
oftugmasters, trailers and forklift trucks, as well as the mobile crane will also result in&#13;
modest increases in handling productivity for other cargo.&#13;
22.   The new equipment should raise ship-to-shore container handling productivity to&#13;
30 TEU/hour, compared to the present productivity of about 5 TEU/hour. The mobile&#13;
cranes would be used primarily on container ships and it is probable that containers&#13;
arriving on multi-purpose vessels will continue to be handled mainly by present methods.&#13;
The extent of the productivity gain will depend upon:&#13;
(i)   The extent to which the shipping lines increase the size of their vessels to&#13;
meet the increased level of traffic.&#13;
(ii)   The extent to which the increased traffic encourages the shipping lines to&#13;
shift container services from unscheduled to scheduled services with&#13;
arrivals on a predictable basis.&#13;
(iii)  The dedication, by the port, of a particular berth for container vessels, and&#13;
the stationing of one of the tower cranes at that berth.&#13;
23.   It is assumed that the tower cranes will only handle containers on full container&#13;
ships (75 percent of all containers in 2000), have an average availability of 85 percent&#13;
(certainly attainable during its first five years of service), and vessels will normally be&#13;
worked with only a single tower crane. Average container handling rates could rise to&#13;
over 30 TEU/hour but, given the time required to adjust to new handling systens, a very&#13;
conservative estimate of 15 TEU/hour has been adopted, equivalent to about 125&#13;
tonnes/hour. The overall impact of the project on berth occupancy in 2000 is shown in&#13;

Overall Economic Benefits&#13;
24.   The primary benefit of the proposed project will be the increased handling&#13;
productivity for containers carried by container ships. Handling rates are conservatively&#13;
expected to increase from about 4.5 TEU/hour to 15 TEU/hour. This improvement in the&#13;
container handling rate will:&#13;

(i)    Reduce the berth time for container ships;&#13;
(ii)    Reduce overall berth occupancy, thus reducing berthing delays for all ships,&#13;
as well as allowing the port to handle increased cargo; and&#13;
(iii)   Increase the likelihood that the container lines will shift from feeder&#13;
services to direct liner calls. This shift in the container service could reduce&#13;
the container freight rates by, at least, US$500/TEU.&#13;
25.    In view of the high berth occupancy rates, even with the investment, the shift to&#13;
direct liner services is uncertain and these benefits, which could be very substantial, have&#13;
not been included in the economic analysis. Based on the conventional methodology used&#13;
for estimating economic benefits from port investment, the project's economic benefits are&#13;

26.   On the basis of the central traffic and cargo handling forecasts, the investment will&#13;
generate almost US$8.5 million of net benefits in 2000 (operations and maintenance will&#13;
cost approximately US$0.50 million), a very high return on an investment of US$11. 10&#13;
million, Table 14. The primary benefit from the investment is the reduction im berthing&#13;
delays and, at high berth occupancy rates, these delays are very sensitive to relatively small&#13;
changes in the underlying parameters. It would be unrealistic to assume the berthing delay&#13;
benefits will continue throughout the life of the equipment. The Government of Eritrea&#13;
gives high priority to the implementation of Phase II of the Port Development Program,&#13;
and it is assumed that berth 13 and possibly 14 will be constructed by the end of 2002, as a&#13;
specialzed container terminal. The equipment under this project will be incorporated into&#13;
the operations of the new terminal.&#13;

short-term benefits by reducing berth occupancy and ship waiting delays. The economic&#13;
returns are, however, very sensitive to the underlying assumptions regarding cargo flows&#13;
and handling rates. To test the sensitivity of the analysis, the economic returns were&#13;
estimated on the basis of other assumptions regarding traffic and cargo handling&#13;

* The scenario is not fiasible as Assab %ould have reached saturation by 2000&#13;
28.   The proposed investment only becomes marginal under a scenario of substantially&#13;
increased bulk and general cargo handling rates, even without the investment. The&#13;
economic returns on these scenarios are underestimated, however, as berth occupancy in&#13;
2000 would be reduced to below 70 percent, which would allow the creation of a&#13;
dedicated container facility within the existing port, thereby attracting direct liner calls and&#13;
postponing the need to construct the planned new berths.&#13;
29.   The productivity of the ship-to-shore tower cranes has yet to demonstrated at&#13;
Assab. It is, however, very unlikely that their productivity will fall substantially below the&#13;
central estimate used in this analysis, 50 percent of their potential handling rate. Under the&#13;
central traffic and cargo handling forecasts, the Port of Assab has reached such a critical&#13;
state by 2000 that even if the equipment improved handling productivity to only 8&#13;
TEU/hour, the investment would still be justified. In terms of total economic retums,&#13;
therefore, the proposed investment in container handling equipment is justified.&#13;
Economic Returns to Eritrea&#13;
30.   The economic benefits discussed and estimated in the previous section will accrue&#13;
to the port users (vessel and cargo owners) rather than to the port authority. In most&#13;
situations such analysis is sufficient to justify the investment, as competition within the&#13;
shipping sector will transfer most of the benefits to the domestic economy through lower&#13;
freight rates. The same process may be substantially true in Assab except that the&#13;
domestic economy is effectively Ethiopia rather then Eritrea. On a regional basis, the&#13;
investment is justified but, in terms of the Eritrean economy, few benefits have been&#13;
demonstrated.&#13;
31.   The benefit of Assab port to the Eritrean economy is basically the net surplus&#13;
generated by the port. The proposed investment could thus be justified by a reduction in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-72-                                ANNEX2&#13;
- 72 - -                       Page 12 of 16&#13;
the operating costs of the port and/or an increase in port revenues paid by ship owners,&#13;
cargo consignees and consignors. It could be argued that, given the level of benefits to&#13;
port-users, the port should be able to transfer sufficient of the benefits, through&#13;
adjustments to the port tariff to justify the investment. Much of the benefit from the&#13;
investment is in the form of avoided berthing delays in future years and these benefits may&#13;
not be perceived by port users and tariff increases could appear arbitrary.&#13;
32.   The economic analysis implicitly assumes that, if berth capacity is not exceeded,&#13;
the forecast level of.traffic could be handled in the 'without investment' scenario. In&#13;
reality, it is unlikely that the level of container traffic could be handled without additional&#13;
investment in on-shore container handling equipment. Moreover, the analysis assumes&#13;
that increased berth congestion and berthing delays will not result in traffic diversion to&#13;
other ports. For bulk, bagged and conventional break-bulk cargo, this assumption may be&#13;
reasonable as Djibouti has a poor reputation for such cargo. For containers, however,&#13;
Djibouti has a fully equipped and under-utilized container terminal. Djibouti is also&#13;
directly served by the conference lines and container freight rates to Djibouti are&#13;
substantially lower than to Assab which is served by multi-purpose ships and container&#13;
feeder vessels.&#13;
33.   The role of Djibouti in the container trade to Ethiopia has been constrained by the&#13;
very limited capacity of the rail link to Ethiopia, the restrictions on the road movement of&#13;
commercial cargo, and road links constrained by either security problems or poor&#13;
operating conditions. While major improvements to the railway are unlikely, efforts are&#13;
being made by both the Dfibouti and Ethiopian Governments to remove the road and road&#13;
transport constraints. As a consequence, Assab will soon face greater competition from&#13;
Djibouti and must increase its effective capacity and improve its level of service, if it is to&#13;
maintain its share of the container market.&#13;
34.   Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to estimate precisely the level of container&#13;
handling capacity at Assab. Based on the equipment parameters conventionally used in&#13;
terminal planning, Assab has a capacity of about 28,000 TEU. But, the port handled&#13;
32,700 TEU in 1996, though with some problems. These handling problems will increase&#13;
substantially with the growth in container traffic, and other general cargo (some of the&#13;
equipment is employed for container and break-bulk cargo e.g. the smaller forklifts and the&#13;
tugmasters and trailers).&#13;
35.   To meet the central traffic estimate for containers in 2000, at existing standards, a&#13;
minimum investment of about US$ 3.1 million would be required:&#13;
3 container lifting trucks (US$1.35 milion)&#13;
5 tugmasters and 15 trailers (US$1. 15 million)&#13;
9 small forklifts (US$0.63 million)&#13;
This very basic capacity investment would account for 30 percent of the proposed&#13;
investment and would neither improve the level of service nor reduce berthing delays.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
- 73 -                          Page 13 of 16&#13;
36.   Some of the traffic and handling rate scenarios indicate that Assab, without&#13;
investment, will have exceeded berth capacity by 2000, and some traffic would have been&#13;
suppressed or, more likely, diverted to Djibouti. Even under the central traffic and cargo&#13;
handling estimates, berthing delays in 2000 would average about 4 days per vessel, at a&#13;
cost of over US$100/TEU and this would be in addition to the penalty which Assab&#13;
already faces from being served by feeder vessels. With these cost and service penalties, it&#13;
is almost inevitable that some container traffic will divert to Djibouti. The problem is&#13;
forecasting the potential level of diversion, combining the increased accessibility of&#13;
Pjibouti (through improved land transport) and deteriorating conditions at Assab.&#13;
37.   To test the potential financial benefits of the investment for the Port of Assab, a&#13;
number of scenarios of potential capacity limits, and increased container handling charges&#13;
(to reflect improved quality of service) were tested, Table 16. These scenarios are&#13;
underestimates of the total financial benefits to the Port as they exclude the benefits to&#13;
other traffics of the investment, and the reduced shipping revenue, if container shipping is&#13;
reduced. The estimates are based on the central forecast for container traffic.&#13;

38.   Even if the container handling capacity of Assab was as high as 42,500 TEU/year,&#13;
which is veiy unlikely, the investment would be financial viable with an additional charge&#13;
of US$25/TEU, an increase of about 10 percent increase on existing charges. The&#13;
investment would be justified, without any additional handling charge, if capacity was only&#13;
37,500 TEU/year, which is already 33% higher than the capacity calculated with&#13;
conventional container terminal equipment planning parameters.&#13;
39.   The investment will maintain overall service standards at the Port of Assab, and&#13;
provide considerably enhanced container handling facilities. The investment is essential to&#13;

40.   As in Massawa, the Assab component of the project also includes an investment of&#13;
US$0.8 million in pollution equipment; primarily to improve facilities for the discharge of&#13;
pollutants and for combating minor oil spills. In view of the very limited investment and&#13;
major improvement in environmental protection, this investment is considered to be very&#13;
cost-effective and fully justified.&#13;
41.   Assab is very exposed to winds; the area is heavily influenced by the north east&#13;
monsoons in the Indian Ocean, particularly during the winter months of October to May,&#13;
when the wind reaches Beaufort Force 7 (28 to 33 knots) and frequently Force 8 (34 to 40&#13;
knots). The problems of ship handling during these windy conditions have been increasing&#13;
with the increased number of large vessels with greater windage areas4/. During berthing&#13;
and unberthing, vessels must rely almost entirely on the tugs to counteract the wind effect.&#13;
The number and size of ships calling at Assab in 1992 - 1995, and the forecast for 2000&#13;
are shown in Table 17.&#13;
Table 17 - Port of Assab: ship Arrivals&#13;

42.   The tug requirement varies according to ship size, location of berth within the port&#13;
area and prevailing weather conditions. For the purposes of assessing tug needs in 2000,&#13;
the following assumptions are considered realistic:&#13;
Category A: One-third (133) of this group require no tugs at all, one-third (133) requires 1&#13;
tug on arrival only, and one-third (133) require 1 tug on arrival and 1 tug on departure;&#13;
Category B: Two-thirds (93) of this group require 2 tugs on arrival and 1 tug on&#13;
departure, and one-third (47) require 2 tugs on arrival and 2 tugs on departure;&#13;
4 / Particularly sensitive are the crude oil tankers mooring at the crude oil terminal (a conventional buoy&#13;
mooring at sea, around 1000 m from the shoreline), half laden bulk vessels, and car carriers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX 2&#13;
- 75 -                             Page 15 of 16&#13;
Category C: Two-thirds (67) of this group require 2 tugs on arrival and 2 tugs on&#13;
departure, and one-third (33) require 3 tugs5/ on arrival and 2 tugs on departure.&#13;
43.   As a general requirement, each tug should be capable of exerting a straight bollard&#13;
pull of not less than 15-18 tons. The tugs should be highly maneuverable and built and&#13;
maintained to a standard equivalent to Lloyd's Register of Shipping Class 100 Al Tug. In&#13;
addition, the tugs should be equipped with fire fighting equipment and storage facilities for&#13;
oil pollution control equipment.&#13;
44.   The port has presently two tug boats, one in a reasonably good condition (built&#13;
1987 - 1,600 HP), and one in a very poor condition ("Nakfa" - built 1980 - 1,400 HP).&#13;
"Nakfa" was recently taken out of operation6/ for major overhaul of the hull, but she is&#13;
still not suitable for the services required. According to the Classification papers upon&#13;
delivery in 1980 the original speed was 11.73 knots at 750 rpm, today's speed is around 6&#13;
knots at 500 rpm. The maneuverability is severely hampered, and due to its design and&#13;
propulsion system the tug boat can only be used for pushing during berthing activities.&#13;
The shortage of adequate tug services in the port of Assab is increasingly causing great&#13;
concern regarding safe ship handling in the port, particularly during berthing/unberthing of&#13;
oil tankers to the mooring buoy, and to the oil jetties for refined products. The deficiency&#13;
in tug boat services is also causing concern to the shipping lines, and it is reported that&#13;
vessels have refused to enter the port and instead called at Djibouti to discharge cargo.&#13;
45.   To provide for the minimum requirement of 2 suitable tug boats, and for adequate&#13;
bollard pull requirement and safe ship handling, it is considered of utmost importance to&#13;
replace the smaller tugboat with a tugboat of around 2,000-2,400 HP, at an estimated cost&#13;
of around US$3.35 million. This investment is considered to be filly justified on safety&#13;
and environmental grounds. In addition to the safety and environmental safeguards&#13;
provided by the tug, a significant source of berth delays will be reduced. As discussed in&#13;
paras. 16 and 17, berthing delays at Assab are substantially greater than would be&#13;
expected from the level of shipping; there is a 20 hour delay which cannot be explained by&#13;
berth occupancy rates. A significant proportion of this delay is caused by ships' waiting&#13;
for either tugs and/or reduced wind speeds (to compensate for the lack of tug capacity).&#13;
Precise details of the composition of these berthing delays are not available; consequently,&#13;
it is not possible to calculate a definite economic rate of return on the investment in the&#13;
tug. It is, however, possible to calculate the reduction of berthing delay which would be&#13;
necessary to justify the investment, Table 17.&#13;
5 / It would be necessary to accept some delays to the berthing of around 30-35 vessels per year to await&#13;
calm weather conditions necessary to berth those ships with only 2 tugs.&#13;
61 The tug Awet, delivered in 1992 to the port of Massawa as a grant from WFP, was chartered during&#13;
the period of maintenance. This was made possible as Massawa in 1995 received a new (1,800 HP)&#13;
tug boat under the RRPE project.&#13;

The analysis assumes a 15 year life for the tug, and an annual O&amp;M cost equivalent to 5&#13;
percent ofthe capital costs. The investment in the tug would be justified on solely&#13;
economic criteria, if it reduced berthing delays by 5 hours/ship, 25 percent of the&#13;
'unexplained' berthing delay. In view of the fact that 240 ships should be maneuvered by&#13;
at least two tugs, these time savings should probably be considered as a minimum&#13;
estimate. Assab Port management consider that the likely savings in average berthing time&#13;
will be somewhere between 5 - 10 hours. There is thus a strong economic justification for&#13;
the tug, as well as undoubted environmental and safety justifications.&#13;

ERITREAN PORTS AUTHORITY&#13;
PORT SECTOR DEVELOPMENT STUDY&#13;
DRAFT TERMS OF REFERENCE&#13;
L     Background to the Assignment&#13;
1.    Eritrea has two national ports, Massawa Port and Assab Port, which presently&#13;
serve both Eritrea and neighboring countries.&#13;
2.    Massawa Port is located on the southern shore of the Red Sea, to the north of&#13;
Eritrea. The port has quite good natural conditions and a long history. In the past the&#13;
port played an important role in trading, economic development, communication and&#13;
exchange with foreign countries. In recent years, its activities have been constrained by&#13;
war, outdated facilities, inadequate and obsolete equipment and lack of maintenance. The&#13;
port has six commercial berths, constructed between 1918 - 1941, which have lengths of&#13;
137 - 176m, and depths of 4.9 - 9. lI. The port handled almost 650,000 tons of dry cargo&#13;
in 1994 with:&#13;
65 percent berth occupancy&#13;
-   122 hour ship tum-around time&#13;
-   40 hour ship anchorage time&#13;
-   82 hour ship berth time&#13;
i   21 tons per ship-berth hour&#13;
3.    Assab Port is a modern port, constructed in early 1960, located in the south of&#13;
Eritrea. Ethiopian cargo accounts for over 95 percent of its traffic and the port has to&#13;
compete for this traffic with neighboring countries. Compared.to Massawa, the port is&#13;
well equipped but is experiencing constraints for container handling. The port has seven&#13;
commercial berths, which have lengths of 80 - 160m and depths of 5.5 - 1 1.Om. These&#13;
berths handle over one million tons of dry cargo with:&#13;
73 percent berth occupancy&#13;
155 hour ship turn-around time&#13;
42 hour ship anchorage time&#13;
113 hour ship berth time&#13;
*   28 tons per ship-berth hour&#13;
4.    The Government of Eritrea has embarked on a three phase Port Development&#13;
Program to make the sector modern and competitive so that it can play a key innovative&#13;
role in the reconstruction of the country and the promotion of its foreign trade:&#13;

5.    As part of the Development Program a rehabilitation study was conducted for&#13;
Massawa Port. The study prepared a development and rehabilitation program for the&#13;
period 1995 - 2004. The study recommended the following:&#13;
*   Rehabilitation of berths 5 &amp; 6&#13;
3   Extension of berth 6&#13;
* : Increasing draft for berths 5 &amp; 6 to 12 meter&#13;
- ItReclamation of the lagoon behind the breakwater for container&#13;
stacking&#13;
-   Rationalization of the cargo working areas, including demolition of&#13;
buildings between the warehouses and the open shed&#13;
* New cargo handling equipment&#13;
6.    The implementation of the proposed project will commence in late-1997. The&#13;
traffic forecasts indicate, however, that further capacity expansion will be needed in the&#13;
very near fiuture and it is thus necessary to plan for Phases II and HI as their&#13;
implementation is clearly inevitable. This plannig will run concurrently with the&#13;
execution of Phase I of the Development Program.&#13;
IL    Objectives of the Assignment&#13;
7.    The basic objective of the assignment is to prepare a Master Plan for the port&#13;
sector in Eritrea, within the context of the Port Development Program. To meet this basic&#13;
objective the following will be necessary:&#13;
(a)   Full feasibility study for the potential expansion of both Massawa and&#13;
Assab Ports (Phase 11), including the construction of specialized berths&#13;
together with their equipment and associated facilities. The study should&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
-   -                             ANNEX3&#13;
Page 3 of 8&#13;
prepare preliminary engineering designs for the container terminal at&#13;
Massawa and a detailed review of the existing designs for the container&#13;
terminal at Assab. The study should provide terms of reference for the&#13;
further detailed engineering studies that will be required.&#13;
(b)   Full feasibility study for the revitalization and upgrading of the ship repair&#13;
yard in Massawa, emphasizing the development of ship repair facilities&#13;
(slipways, dry docks and/or floating docks) on the basis of different vessel&#13;
capacity scenarios i.e. 1000, 5000, and 10000 DWT vessels. In&#13;
determining the economic and financial feasibility for the ship repair&#13;
facilities, the study will assess the demand for such repair facilities from&#13;
both the Eritrean and regional shipping fleets, and identify the existing&#13;
supply of such facilities within the region.&#13;
(c)   Master Plan study for the implementation of Phase HI of the Port&#13;
Development Program, focusing on requirements for:&#13;
Berths&#13;
Storage areas&#13;
Equipment and facilities&#13;
. -Manpower&#13;
8.    The study will identify the potential locations for the new port, prepare outline&#13;
engineering designs for each location and provide cost estimates for their likely&#13;
development costs in terms of both port infrastructure and facilities, and associated land&#13;
transport infrastructure. The Master Plan will prepare recommendations for the scope and&#13;
timing of the development of the new port on the basis of the prospective demand for the&#13;
facility and the estimated costs. The study will also assess potential financing&#13;
arrangements for the development of the new port, including both public and private&#13;
funding sources.&#13;
(a)   Review of potential industrial developments at Massawa to determine&#13;
medium and longer-term demands for port capacity and facilities. The&#13;
study will assess the potential feasibility for the establishment for such&#13;
activities as:&#13;
heavy port-based industries, such as cement&#13;
*   exporting processing zones (EPZ) and free trade zones (FTZ)&#13;
*   transshipment and transit facilities&#13;
9.    The review will assess the potential demand for such activities taking into account&#13;
similar existing or proposed facilities within the region, the services offered and the tariffs&#13;
and rates charged. On the basis of the review, the Consultant will estimate both the nature&#13;
and capacity of port facilities required to meet the demand from these new activities.&#13;

goods, and transit cargo) and the facilities available for such cargoes.&#13;
*   Review existing port services including the loadig/unloading of cargo,&#13;
storage, and transport through the ports, and assess the performance of these&#13;
services in terms of ship service and waiting times, cargo detention times,&#13;
and cargo loss and damage.&#13;
*   Review past trends and present port traffic by vessel category (coastal,&#13;
regional, international), type (bulk cargo, tanker, general cargo, container,&#13;
ro-ro), and size, as well as by the tonnage of different commodities imported&#13;
and exported.&#13;
Prepare reasonable forecasts of port traffic and utilization for the period to&#13;
the year 2010, by commodity and mode of cargo handling (bulk, bagged,&#13;

Dear Madam:&#13;
Re: 1RrrREA - Letter of Port Sector Policy&#13;
1. Eritrea's Macro-Economic policy states that this country aims to become&#13;
a trading nation, the future prosperity of the people will depend on Eritrea's&#13;
international trade. As a matter of pre-condition to achieving this aim, there&#13;
is need, alongside other indispensable measure, to rehabilitate the facilities&#13;
of the ports of Masswa and Assab, to improve their perforrmance, and make&#13;
them competitive as well as addressing environmental issues.&#13;
2. During thirty years of war and deliberate negligence of the Derg&#13;
Govemrnment, the port of Masswa had its capacity drastically reduced; part of&#13;
its berth capacity collapsed, main equipment &amp; supporting facilities were&#13;
destroyed or worn out and skilled manpower depleted. Today all primary&#13;
indicators like berth throughput, labour productivity, transit time, shore&#13;
handling practices, cargo tracking, etc. are by intemational standards either&#13;
low or very low depending on the cargo handled. Assab compare favorable&#13;
with Masswa, though by international standards its performance is low.&#13;
3.  In order to tun development plans into reality the Government is&#13;
adhering to a policy of encouraging domcstic and foreign investnent with the&#13;
participation of the private sector in the overall maritime transport services.&#13;

4. In 1955 the Government decided to organize the ports within a&#13;
Department of Maritime Transport (DMT) under the Ministry of Transport &amp;&#13;
Communication, and the two ports as well as the Eritrean Shipping and&#13;
Transit Agency Services (ERSTAS) were established as commercial entities&#13;
under the supervision of a sector board chaired by the Minster of Transport&#13;
and Communication (Proclamation No. 83/1995).&#13;
5. For the ports, the Government's policy is to continue to develop the&#13;
fr-amework for the efficient commercial management and operation of the&#13;
ports of Assab and Masswa. To this end the Government intends to take the&#13;
following actions:&#13;
* revise and enact the country's maritime legislation to meet current IMO&#13;
conventions on maritime safety and environment;&#13;
a revise and enact legislation to establish the port as separate juridical&#13;
authorities under a revised ports act; this act would affirm the ports'&#13;
powers to act commercially as well as their obligation to achieve&#13;
performaance objectives consistenq with the Government's overall&#13;
development goals;&#13;
* establish the minimum return it expects the port authorities to generate&#13;
from their operations:&#13;
* establish a capital structure for each port authority, including the terms&#13;
and conditions of long-term debt in this structure;&#13;
X establish a policy for the financing of future investments in the port by&#13;
the Government, including their terms and conditions of any debt provided&#13;
under this policy;&#13;
* Strengthen the frame work for the periodic reporting by the port&#13;
authorities to the DMT on their performance.&#13;
6. These actions will be implemented progressively over the cgmtog.1&#13;
wa. The implementation will rcquire the introduction of new or revised&#13;
systems and procedures for conducting and monitoring the operation of the&#13;
ports, assessment of the ports assets and potential operating capacity, and&#13;
extensive training of the workforce. In this regard, the Government's aim is to&#13;
continuc to draw as much as possible upon best practices for ports&#13;
operations and managemcnt worldwide.&#13;

7.  In addition to financing specific equipment and infrastructure, the&#13;
Government envisages that the proposed IDA financed Ports Rehabilitation&#13;
Project would be an important step in its effort to acquire lmowledge of such&#13;
best industry practices.&#13;
8   With regard to the  project, and consistent with the sector strategy&#13;
outlined in this Policy Letter, the Government intends to take the following&#13;
actions:&#13;
a) all IDA financing for investments in the ports will be on-lent to the ports on&#13;
commercial terms. These terms will be defined by December 31. 1999 within&#13;
the framework of the financing policy as outlined in this Policy. Letter;&#13;
b) in relation to the Government's policy with regard to the financial returns&#13;
from the operations of the ports. it is the government's intention to ensure to&#13;
the extent possible that the ports will generate, at minimum, cash flows from&#13;
their operations that are sufficient to cover their working capital&#13;
requirements and debt service obligations. It is the Governments intention to&#13;
specify these terms by December 31.1999 after completion of all actions&#13;
necessary to establish a capital structure for the ports. Subsequent to&#13;
establishing financial objectives for the ports, the Government will expect, as&#13;
currently, that the management of the ports will take all actions necessary to&#13;
achieve such objectives, including maintaining appropriate levels of accounts&#13;
receivable.&#13;

BORROWER'S CONTRIBUTION TO SUPERVISION&#13;
1.    The Borrower's supervision activities would be carried out by the Department of&#13;
Maritime Transport (DMT) within the Ministry of Transport. A Project Coordination&#13;
Unit (PCU) will be established for the life of the project and located at the Department's&#13;
Port Liasion Office in Asmara. The unit will be headed by of a Project Coordinator, and&#13;
will include financial and procurement expertise. The supervisory functions of the unit will&#13;
involve the following:&#13;
(a) Submission to IDA of quarterly progress reports on all Project components,&#13;
including operational performances for the two ports, and statistical information;&#13;
(b) Submission to IDA of all consultant's reports produced in connection with project&#13;
activities;&#13;
(c) The audits of project accounts and the Special Account, as well as financial&#13;
accounts of the two ports of Massawa and Assab, will be sent to IDA within six&#13;
months of the close of each fiscal year; and&#13;
(d) PCU will be responsible for coordinating arrangements for Bank supervision&#13;
missions and for providing information required by missions.&#13;
Bank Supervision&#13;
2.    In addition to regular supervision missions to be carried out by IDA, in accordance&#13;
with the schedule set out below, IDA staff would spend time at Headquarters dealing with&#13;
correspondence, reviewing and approving procurement documents, disbursement requests,&#13;
quarterly reports, and audited accounts. The amount of time required for supervision of&#13;
the project in Washington is estimated to be as follows:&#13;
Project   Year 1   10 staffweeks&#13;
Year 2    10 staffweeks&#13;
Year 3    6 staffweeks&#13;
Year 4    4 staffweeks&#13;
Year 5    4 staffweeks&#13;

SUMMARY OF ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT&#13;
ASSESSMENT&#13;
1.    Rehabilitation of berths 5 &amp; 6 in Massawa includes repair of a collapsed section of&#13;
the existing quay, establishment of a new quay section with 12 m waterdepth, dredging&#13;
and reclamation. The project further includes clearing of part of the port area and&#13;
provision of new cargo handling equipment. The components for Assab include container&#13;
handlng equipment, facilities and equipment for reception of ship's waste, and a&#13;
replacement tug boat.&#13;
2.    An environmental assessment of the project and the following operation of the&#13;
ports have shown the following potential environmental impacts:&#13;
*  The realignment of berths 5 &amp; 6 is assumed to lead to a slight increase in the water&#13;
circulation within the port and may therefore have a minor positive impact on the&#13;
marine environment.&#13;
* Construction of berths 5 &amp; 6 (pile installation etc.) will cause minor temporary&#13;
impacts. These, however, are not considered seriously and will not cause lasting&#13;
damage to the marine environment.&#13;
*  The project includes dredging of approximately 50,000 n3. Analysis of the&#13;
material to be dredged have shown that this is suitable for reclamation purposes&#13;
and free from contamination of heavy metals.&#13;
- It is recommended that the dredged material shall be used for reclamation.&#13;
*  The dredging work should preferably be executed by a cutter suction dredger in&#13;
order to reduce the spill during the implementation.&#13;
*  Dredging and reclamation should not be initiated before a sheet pile wall has been&#13;
installed in front of the lagoon, thereby creating a closed basin where&#13;
sedimentation can take place. The content of solid material shall be below 2-3%&#13;
before the pumping water is let back to the harbour/sea.&#13;
*  A survey of unexploded ordnances should be performed before construction works&#13;
start. If the survey detects possible unexploded ordnances, these should be&#13;
removed before the dredging works start.&#13;
&#13;

Resettlement&#13;
3.    Some 40 port staff (ex-fighters) who were given shelter in the port after the&#13;
Liberation War, as well as a number of staff from the Customs Authority and the&#13;
Ministries of Finance and Health (about 120 people in total) are currently living in&#13;
government-owned houses in the port of Massawa. Both the Port Authority and the&#13;
Massawa Municipal Authority have determined that for safety and security reasons no-one&#13;
should be living within the port boundaries. Steps are being taken through the Port&#13;
Authority and Municipality of Massawa to ensure alternative accommodation for these&#13;
people, with houses being set aside for them in a new housing development currently&#13;
under construction.&#13;
Treatment of Hazardous and Noxious Cargo&#13;
4.    The ports have very limited facilties and guidelines for handling and storage of&#13;
hazardous and noxious cargo. Currently the ports normally require such materials to be&#13;
handled as direct delivery in order to avoid storage of materials such as explosives and&#13;
very toxic cargo.&#13;
5.    The existing procedures for handling and storage of hazardous cargo are&#13;
inadequate and do not meet international standards. -Likewise the -equipment for&#13;
combating accidents are insufficient.&#13;
6.    The ports will under the project establish procedures for handling and storage of&#13;
this kind of cargo, as well as establishing emergency plans in case of accidents for the&#13;
different cargo types. The procedures would be in accordance with guidelines developed&#13;
by IMO.&#13;
7.    Establishment of improved procedures for handling and storage of dangerous&#13;
cargo and the subsequent compliance with these procedures will have a positive&#13;
environmental impact.&#13;
Handling of Ship's Wastes&#13;
8.    At present facilities in the ports of Massawa and Assab for collection, storage and&#13;
treatment of ship's waste are very limited.&#13;
9.    The project will provide for improvements of equipment and facilities for reception&#13;
of ship's waste, including bilgewater, sludge from oily separators and used lubricants, and&#13;
solid waste. Treatment of oily waste wil be done at the refinery in Assab, while chemicals&#13;
have to be taken to Jeddah or other places for final treatment.&#13;
10.   The system to be established for reception of solid waste will be closely&#13;
coordinated with the Municipalities of Massawa and Assab, as the solid waste will have to&#13;
be dumped at the existing dumping site.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -                           ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 3 of 4&#13;
11.   Implementation of the above facilities should reduce the amount of waste dumped&#13;
by sea and wil therefore have a positive environmental impact.&#13;
Maritime Safety&#13;
12.   Assab is very exposed to winds; the area is heavily influenced by the north east&#13;
monsoons in the Indian Ocean, particularly during the winter months of October to may&#13;
when wind reaches Beaufort Force 7 (28 to 33 knots) and frequently Force 8 (34 to 40&#13;
knots). During berthing and unberthing vessels must rely almost entirely on the tugs to&#13;
counteract the wind effect.&#13;
13.   The port has presently two tug boats, one in a reasonable good condition (built&#13;
1987 - 1,600 HP), and one in a very poor condition (built 1980 - 1,400 HP). The&#13;
shortage of adequate tug services in the port is increasingly causing great concern&#13;
regarding safe ship handling in the port, particularly during berthing/unberthing of crude&#13;
oil tankers to the mooring buoy, and to the oil jetties for refined products.&#13;
14.   To arrange for the minimum requirement of 2 suitable tug boats, and for adequate&#13;
bollard pull requirement and safe ship handling, the project will provide for an additional&#13;
powerful tug boat of around 2,000 to 2,400 HP.&#13;
National Oil Spill Contingency Plan&#13;
15.   The State of Eritrea has no National Oil Spill Response Plan developed, and the&#13;
two ports have no equipment for combating potential oil spills. The project, in&#13;
conjunction with local and International oil industry interests, will provide for equipment&#13;
and facilities for Eritrea to develop a National Oil Spill Response Plan. Draft Terms of&#13;
Reference for the final design the component has been agreed with the Borrower.&#13;
Draft TOR&#13;
16.   The objective of this component is to ensure the structured development of&#13;
adequate and tested National Oil Spill Response Plans for the State of Eritrea. The&#13;
consultant should visit the country and, in conjunction with local and International oil&#13;
industry interests, lay out a program in agreement with the appropriate local and national&#13;
Eritrean Government agencies that will:&#13;
(a)   assess the risk of oil spills from all sources that could threaten the coastline&#13;
and its associated islands and coral reefs;&#13;
(b)   identify sensitive areas, socio-economic as well as environmental, that&#13;
would need protection;&#13;
(c)   develop response strategies suitable for the region;&#13;

- 100 -                         ANNEX 10&#13;
Page 4 of 4&#13;
(d)   identify any additional equipment needs consistent with those response&#13;
strategies and having due regard to the financial and infrastructure&#13;
constraints of the country;&#13;
(e)   define a training program for oil spill contingency planners and responders;&#13;
(f)   define an oil spill exercise program that will ensure the gradual&#13;
development of local expertise in this field; and&#13;
(g)   In carrying out this task the consultant should take into account:&#13;
(i)   the need for the ownership of the program to be vested in the&#13;
appropriate National Authorities and the substance of the program&#13;
to be based on partnership with industry at both national and&#13;
intemational levels;&#13;
(ii)  the IMO Consultant report "Assessment of the Ability of The State&#13;
of Eritrea to respond to Marine Pollution Emergencies"&#13;
(M.S.Dillon m, 15 - 28 Oct, 1995);&#13;
(iii)  the present arrangements put in place by government and industry&#13;
locally and nationally;&#13;
(iv)  the various IMO and Industry publications and Guidelines on Spill&#13;
Response matters;&#13;
(v)   the need to integrate key plan holders into the planning cycle,&#13;
especially in respect of plan ownership, training and&#13;
implementation;&#13;
(vi)  the need to ensure that the arrangements recommended will create a&#13;
viable and sustainable response plan;&#13;
(vii)  the current organizational arrangements in place regarding the&#13;
allocation of roles and responsibilities for oil spill policies, practices&#13;
and response strategies within the State and if necessary and&#13;
appropriate make recommendations for improvement; and&#13;
(viii)  the need to allow for ongoing support and guidance from the&#13;
consultant to achieve the objectives set for the development of the&#13;
necessary spill response capacity within the country.&#13;

RISK ANALYSIS&#13;
Assumptions&#13;
1.    The rationale and assumptions made for the calculation of the Internal Rate of&#13;
Retum (IRR) are identical to those made in the deterministic economic analysis (number&#13;
of berths, savings amount per vessel type, etc.).&#13;
2.    The statistical assumptions on characteristics of the distributions used were chosen&#13;
rather subjectively because of the lack of detailed data. They have nonetheless been&#13;
deemed accurate enough to represent the overall likelihood that the project will reach its&#13;
economic targets.&#13;
On growth&#13;
3.    The normal distribution used for simulating the growth of traffic is based on the&#13;
high-medium-low scenarios elaborated for the growth of the overall Eritrean economy.&#13;
Because the medium scenario seems to be a somewhat easily achievable target, the&#13;
distribution is biased to allow 20% more chance for the growth rate to be within the&#13;
medium-high interval than for it to be within the low-medium interval.&#13;
4.    On the grounds that there is no particular reason for the Eritrean economy to&#13;
perform either extremely successfilly or extremely poorly, the shape given to the&#13;
distribution provides for 80% of the simulated values to gather within the interval medium&#13;
scenario plus 40% and medium scenario minus 20%.&#13;
5.    Because the economy growth rate between 2000 and 2005 and the rate between&#13;
now and the year 2000 will most likely follow similar patterns, the simulations are linked.&#13;
6.    It is most probable that not all cargo types will follow the general growth at the&#13;
exact same pace. The analysis is therefore designed to provide relative flexibility among&#13;
the growth rates applied to each cargo type.&#13;
On delays&#13;
7.    A fairly pessimistic normal distribution whose characteristics imply a 40% chance&#13;
for the project to be delayed by one year and a 10% chance for it to be delayed by two&#13;
years provide for possible delays in implementation of the project. The delays at each of&#13;
the ports are assumed to be independent because problems in implementation are expected&#13;
to arise mainly from local difficulties.&#13;
On handling capacity&#13;
8.    The expected handling rates will depend not only on the equipment provided under&#13;
the project but also on the management improvements. Therefore, they cannot be&#13;
&#13;

deterministicly defined and an uniform distribution allows them to fluctuate around the&#13;
technically designed capacities.&#13;
Results&#13;
9.    Each of the investments show very good prospects. The project in Massawa is&#13;
significantly more secure (virtually 100% chance to reach an internal rate of return higher&#13;
than 20%) than that of the project in Assab (90% to achieve the same goal). This&#13;
difference lies (i) in the short period over which the Assab's project is being assessed (until&#13;
year 2002) and, therefore, the significantly greater impact that delays could have, and&#13;
(ii) in the concept of the two components, at Assab the project essentially focuses on&#13;
improving facilities for the container traffic, whereas the Massawa investment covers all&#13;
types of cargo.&#13;
10.   The pattern of results for the overall project, with 95% chance to reach a rate of&#13;
return higher than 35%, shows how well the project provides for current needs. A very&#13;
positive aspect shown by this analysis, is that it is almost four times more probable that the&#13;
project achieves a rate of return superior to 50% (probability of about 22%) than it is for&#13;
the project to reach a rate of return below 30% (probability of less than 5%),&#13;
demonstrating the extent to which the "12%" traditional hmit for acceptance is surpassed.&#13;
11.   The model's simulation was computed on the software Palisade  ,Risk Version&#13;
1.12 running it for 10,000 iterations. The rate of return has been estimated for the year&#13;
1997.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The Ports Rehabilitation Project is
            designed to increase substantially the productivity and
            capacity of the two ports of Massawa and Assab. To this end,
            the project will provide the financial and technical
            assistance required to rehabilitate and upgrade the two
            ports, optimizing the use of existing facilities, and to
            raise the quality and level of services to international
            standards. The project components are: 1) civil works for
            Massawa, such as repairs, rehabilitation, extension of
            berths; 2) cargo handling equipment for Massawa and Assab;
            3) environment component comprising facilities and equipment
            to improve the operating practices at the two ports; 4)
            training in port operations and equipment maintenance; and
            5) consultancy services, such as supervision of the civil works.
