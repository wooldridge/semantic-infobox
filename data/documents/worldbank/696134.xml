1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.1   Hungary has experienced a major public finance crisis starting in 1994. An excessively&#13;
gradualist approach to the public sector reform, based on the desire to ensure social stability&#13;
during the transition, has led to unsustainable levels of expenditures and fiscal deficits. The large&#13;
budget deficits have expanded Hungary's public debt. With gross external debt of 70 percent of&#13;
GDP, and a debt service of 8 percent of GDP, Hungary is one of the most heavily indebted&#13;
countries.&#13;
1.2   Faced with large internal and external macro imbalances, the Hungarian authorities&#13;
announced in March 1995 a package of stabilization measures, including: (a) significant cuts in&#13;
fiscal expenditures; (b) strict wage controls in the public sector; (c) increases in fiscal revenues;&#13;
and, (d) an up-front devaluation of 9 percent and introduction of a pre-announced crawling peg.&#13;
The stabilization efforts continued in 1996 and included a strict budgetary policy. This policy has&#13;
led to significant improvements. The consolidated government deficit (excluding privatization&#13;
revenues) is expected to be reduced to 4 percent of GDP in 1996 from a record level of 8.4&#13;
percent in 1994. The estimated revenues and expenditures of the general government in 1996, at&#13;
46 percent, and 50 percent respectively, are 7 and 11 percent, respectively, lower than in 1994.&#13;
The primary balance of the general government (excluding interest revenues and expenditures)&#13;
shows an even more radical improvement, from a deficit of 2.7 percent in 1994 to an expected&#13;
surplus of 3.7 percent in 1997. These measures and further fiscal corrections are needed to&#13;
maintain the budget and current account deficits at sustainable levels. Moreover, major structural&#13;
reforms in the public sector and in the banking and enterprise sectors are necessary to reduce the&#13;
size of the State, release resources for the private sector, and thus to ensure a high and sustainable&#13;
growth.&#13;
1.3   To address the most severe structural weaknesses in the public sector, the Government&#13;
has prepared a plan for a comprehensive public finance reform. The reform of the public sector is&#13;
expected to be fully implemented over a period of about four years, starting in 1996. The public&#13;
finance reform program emphasizes institutional improvements that yield the largest budgetary&#13;
savings, promote transparency of actions, while simultaneously increase the efficiency of public&#13;
services and of the allocation of public resources. The program concentrates on restructuring and&#13;
reforming: (a) the welfare system; (b) tax policy and tax administration; (c) public administration&#13;
and public finance management; and (d) intergovernmental finances.&#13;
1.4   The reform of public finance management is necessary to improve the allocation of public&#13;
resources. The organization and financial management of government operations face several&#13;
major problems. First, widespread earmarking of revenues reduces the flexibility in reallocating&#13;
scarce public resources to priority needs. Second, anticipated budget management practices&#13;
hamper effective expenditure control. Third, public debt management is inefficient and suffers&#13;
from too fragmented responsibilities with independent borrowing authority granted to various&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2&#13;
agencies. Fourth, the government financial information system is inadequate for budget planning&#13;
and execution.a&#13;
1.5   The Government has launched a three-year plan, starting in 1996, to improve financial&#13;
planning, budget execution and a better coordination in financing government deficits. This plan&#13;
involves major changes in institutional arrangements, including the budgeting process. Budgetary&#13;
institutions at the central level are being rationalized; number of extrabudgetary funds reduced;&#13;
skills required in public administration redefined; and the employment management and structure&#13;
in the public sector reformed. In January 1996, the Government undertook a critical step to&#13;
ensure budgetary control by establishing a Treasury, and introducing an interim Government&#13;
Financial Management Information System (GFMIS). According to the 1996 Budget Law&#13;
approved by Parliament in December 1995 and the amendment to the Law on Public Finances&#13;
approved in November 1995, all central budgetary institutions and most extrabudgetary funds&#13;
have been absorbed into the Treasury system. A Council of Treasury consisting of representatives&#13;
from the MOF, the NBH and the Treasury has been established as a decision-making body to&#13;
coordinate the monetary, fiscal and debt policies.&#13;
1.6   The IMF has been advising the Government on setting up the Treasury and on key aspects&#13;
of budget preparation and expenditure management over the last two years. The US Treasury and&#13;
the UK Know How Fund are also rendering advice to the Government on budget and treasury&#13;
matters. The Bank has been collaborating with both the IMF and the bilateral providers of&#13;
technical assistance to assist the Government in its reforms and in preparing a Public Sector&#13;
Adjustment Loan (PSAL).&#13;
1.7   The Government has approached the Bank to finance the development and implementation&#13;
of new systems, processes, procedures and methodologies required for the implementation of the&#13;
new institutional structure and processes of public finance, associated with the revised budgetary&#13;
processes and treasury operations and management. The Bank has evaluated the proposals and&#13;
has found the proposed project justified for financing because it:&#13;
-     addresses priority problems (chapter 2);&#13;
-     fits within an overall program for public sector reform (chapter 3);&#13;
-     takes into account lessons from prior Bank experience and is in accord&#13;
with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) (chapter 4);&#13;
-     has priority objectives and needed content (chapter 5);&#13;
-     has reasonable costs and a feasible implementation plan (chapter 6 &amp;7);&#13;
-     would confer important benefits in public finance management (chapter 8);&#13;
the risks are limited and worth taking (chapter 8).&#13;

Following an explanation of the current system in chapter 2, these points are elaborated in&#13;
sequence in subsequent chapters.&#13;
2.    THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM AND ITS SHORT COMINGS&#13;
2.1   Previous analyses by the Hungarian Authorities and by the LIMF and the World Bank staff&#13;
highlighted significant weaknesses in the budget system and the financial management of&#13;
government operations. These have been reported on in previous Bank and IMF reports (e.g.&#13;
Hungary--Strengthening the Financial Management of Government Operations--IMFJFAD, July&#13;
1994, PSAL Concept Paper -January 1996- World Bank). The features of the previous system&#13;
that hindered effective financial management in the central and local governments are summarized&#13;
below.&#13;
Structure of Government&#13;
2.2   The structure of the Hungarian Government and the nature of the general government&#13;
financial flows could be characterized as extremely decentralized, which significantly hindered&#13;
effective budget preparation and execution, as well as cash and debt management. Lack of&#13;
control over Central Budgetary Institution (CBI) activities also retarded potential efficiency&#13;
improvements in resource allocation. CBIs, in addition to performning state tasks as specified in&#13;
their enabling legislation, could supplement their resources by engaging in additional tasks, some&#13;
of which are clearly commercial in nature. However, given the implicit subsidies on the inputs&#13;
they used (equipment, labor, utilities), the prices charged for the goods and services sold by CBIs&#13;
did not reflect the cost to society of the resources used. In addition, widespread earmarking of&#13;
revenues reduced the flexibility in reallocating scarce public resources to priority needs.&#13;
Budget Preparation&#13;
2.3   Under the previous information system (para 2.7), the final data on budgetary chapter&#13;
revenues and expenditures, including activities of the CBIs and Extra-Budgetary Funds (EBFs)&#13;
that they supervise, were often not available. One result of this was a persistent underestimation&#13;
of budgetary chapter revenues, generally the own revenues of CBIs. The unavailability of timely&#13;
and sufficiently disaggregated data on CBI revenues and expenditure made it difficult to reallocate&#13;
budgetary resources among CBIs both within budgetary chapters and among chapters. Moreover,&#13;
limitations in the data reporting system hindered chapters and the MOF in examining the&#13;
efficiency with which these programs are administered. Finally, although data on end-year cash&#13;
balances for each budgetary institution (chapters, CBIs, FBFs) were available, the lack of detailed&#13;
data on revenues and expenditures did not allow the MOF to adjust annual budgetary transfers in&#13;
light of previous year's own revenue performance. Given the CBIs' ability to collect, retain and&#13;
spend own revenues, a right explicitly given in the Law on Public Finance, the total revenue and&#13;
expenditure levels proposed by the Government and approved by Parliament were in fact not rigid&#13;
limits, but were instead indicative targets.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
4&#13;
Budget Execution&#13;
2.4   The decentralized nature of central government operations, and the absence of a central&#13;
Treasury, posed difficulties in effective and efficient cash and debt management. Budgetary&#13;
institutions in Hungary had individual bank accounts. Because the CBIs have independent&#13;
responsibility for own revenues and total expenditures, and because of limitations on the&#13;
timeliness of information generated by the previous system, the MOF and the NBH had&#13;
difficulties in forecasting net government credit.&#13;
2.5   The State Insurance Funds (SIFs) were separated from the state budget in 1989 and split&#13;
into separate pension and health care funds in 1993. However, for some important aspects of&#13;
debt and cash management, they were for all intents and purposes still part of the state budget.&#13;
They had access to the state budget's Liquidity Fund to cover revenue shortfalls. Their revenue&#13;
and expenditure accounts were separate from the Liquidity Fund accounts, however, and the&#13;
MOF was not aware of their projected cash flows. This of course hindered efficient cash and&#13;
debt management, and posed difficulties in formulating and executing effectively monetary&#13;
policy.&#13;
2.6   The SIFs, as well as particular EBFs, are granted, in the context of the annual budget,&#13;
authority to borrow independently of the state budget. Allowing decentralized borrowing powers&#13;
makes macroeconomic control difficult as it is more difficult to convince the independent&#13;
borrowers of the need for adjustments in their activities consistent with changing economic&#13;
circumstances.&#13;
Fiscal Information System&#13;
2.7   As mentioned above, the fiscal information system was inadequate in providing timely&#13;
and sufficiently detailed data on government operations in a form that is useful for policy&#13;
making, execution and control. It should be noted that, following the adoption of the Law on&#13;
Public Finance (LPF), detailed semi-annual reports were required from all budgetary institutions&#13;
at the central government level, as well as aggregated data at the local level. In addition, less&#13;
detailed "flash" reports were required at the end of each quarter. In spite of these improvements,&#13;
budget preparation, execution and control continued to be hobbled by the system. Without&#13;
adequate time to analyze detailed data by institution and by program, the Government was not&#13;
able to use public money efficiently. The budget continued to be prepared with less than&#13;
appropriate knowledge of the present circumstances.&#13;
2.8   The lack of timely information also did not allow adequate expenditure verification and&#13;
control. Moreover, without an effective on-line system, it was not possible to effect rapidly&#13;
cutbacks in budgeted expenditures that became necessary in the face of changing macroeconomic&#13;
circumstances or revenue shortfalls. Finally, the lack of information did not allow appropriate&#13;
consolidation of government revenues and expenditures.&#13;
Debt Management&#13;
2.9    Weaknesses were also present in the management of the public debt. Specifically these&#13;
included: (a) fragmented institutional responsibilities for debt management; (b) independent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
5&#13;
borrowing authority granted to certain government agencies; (c) government financing by the&#13;
National Bank of Hungary (NBH); (d) excessive diversification of government debt instruments&#13;
and of issuing techniques which hindered the deepening of the secondary market; and (e)&#13;
insufficient emphasis on creating institutional conditions (in particular a strengthened legal and&#13;
regulatory framework and adequate supervision) for the smooth functioning and development of&#13;
this market.&#13;
2.10  Shortcomings of the system highlighted in the foregoing paragraphs led to the&#13;
development of the Government's reform program for fiscal management described below.&#13;
3.  REFORM STRATEGY AND PROGRAMS&#13;
A.   IMF Recommendations&#13;
3.1   The main reform measures recommended by a series of IMF (Fiscal Affairs Department)&#13;
missions are summarized below.&#13;
3.2   The Budget Process The central government budget should include the detailed budgets&#13;
of: the state, including the budgetary chapters; each of the CBIs and extra-budgetary funds. The&#13;
approved expenditures for each budgetary chapter and each of the other central government&#13;
agencies should represent mandatory limits for the budget year. Modifications to the approved&#13;
budgets should, in principle, be authorized by Parliament through supplementary budgets.&#13;
3.3   The current classification scheme for the budget should be revised, with a view to&#13;
improving its usefulness for economic analysis and to allow accurate consolidation of&#13;
intragovernmental flows of revenues and expenditures.&#13;
3.4   Government agencies should be required to maintain records of (and once a computerized&#13;
financial information system has been set up, register in it) all phases of expenditures, namely the&#13;
commitment of funds, verification of the obligation to pay, issuance of the payment order, and&#13;
actual disbursement of funds.&#13;
3.5   Financial Management of Government Operations. As a matter of priority, and in line&#13;
with the practice of most western economies, a State Treasury should be established within the&#13;
Ministry of Finance. The Treasury should have as primary responsibilities: (a) planning and&#13;
ensuring the orderly financial execution of the budgets of the central government, including the&#13;
CBIs and the extra-budgetary and social insurance funds; and of the transfers between central&#13;
and local governments; and (b) planning and coordinating the financing of government deficits.&#13;
3.6   The Liquidity Fund of the state and the bank accounts of budgetary chapters, CBIs, extra-&#13;
budgetary funds and social insurance funds should be consolidated into a Treasury Single&#13;
Account (TSA) at the NBH. This step needs to be accompanied by the development and&#13;
progressive implementation of a computerized, on-line government financial management&#13;
information system (GFMIS), the main features of which are outlined below. The consolidation&#13;
of the bank accounts of the above-mentioned entities into a single Treasury Account would be&#13;
accompanied by the creation of ledger accounts for these agencies in the GFMIS. All revenues&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
6&#13;
would be deposited in the T'SA, but would also be credited simultaneously to the appropriate&#13;
account in the GFMIS. Transfers between agencies would be registered in the GFMIS, but&#13;
would not affect the TSA. Only payments to entities outside the system would be debited to the&#13;
TSA. This, of course, would help reduce the financing requirements of the Treasury, and&#13;
consequently the interest charges to the budget.&#13;
3.7   The financial consolidation of government balances would be compatible with the&#13;
continuation of a decentralized execution of the budgets of government agencies. The Treasury&#13;
would continue to ensure an orderly flow of transfers from the state budget to the other agencies.&#13;
The agencies would be able to effect (within the limit of the relevant budgetary allocation) any&#13;
payment for which they had sufficient balance in their GFMIS account.&#13;
3.8   An overview of the proposed GFMIS structure and functions is given at Annex I.&#13;
B.   The Government's Reform Program&#13;
3.9   The Government has now prepared, in association with Bank staff and following the IMF&#13;
recommendations, a plan to address the most severe structural weaknesses in the public sector.&#13;
Some initial measures have been implemented as part of the 1995 stabilization package and&#13;
further measures were planned for 1996. The public sector reform program involves expenditure&#13;
reforms, including a major reform of the local government and pension system; reductions in&#13;
cash benefits combined with better targeting of transfers to the poorest households; and a plan to&#13;
reduce employment in the civil service; revenue system reforms, including gradual reductions in&#13;
payroll taxes; a realignment of the personal income tax structure; and improvements in tax&#13;
administration; and reforms in budgetary institutions and the budgeting processes, including the&#13;
establishment of a Treasury.&#13;
3.10  The proposed reform program will introduce changes in the institutional structure of&#13;
public finance and in the budgeting process. The program will focus as a priority on institutional&#13;
improvements that yield the largest budgetary savings, promote transparency of actions and&#13;
simultaneously reduce waste of state resources and increase the efficiency of public services.&#13;
Complementing these measures, the Government is launching a three year program to establish a&#13;
Treasury, to improve financial planning, budget execution and better coordination of the&#13;
financing of government deficits generated by the various subsystems of public finance.&#13;
3.11  Establishment of a Treasury. rhe Government has established a central Treasury to&#13;
improve: (a) financial planning; (b) financial execution of the budgets of budgetary chapters,&#13;
autonomous central budgetary institutions, extra-budgetary funds and Social Security funds and&#13;
of transfers between central and local governments; and (c) planning and coordination of the&#13;
financing of government deficits. The separate accounts of central budgetary institutions and,&#13;
particularly, the liquidity fund -- the central MOF account, which is the net balance of many credit&#13;
and debit accounts maintained by NBH -- have been progressively consolidated into a Treasury&#13;
Single Account (TSA) maintained by NBH. This consolidation took place with effect from January&#13;
1, 1996. This will be complemented by the development of a GFMIS, incorporating ledger&#13;
accounts for both budget preparation and implementation and a system to monitor financial flows.&#13;
As a result, all government revenues would be deposited in the TSA and simultaneously credited to&#13;
the GFMIS. Transfers between agencies would be registered in the GFMIS but would not affect&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
7&#13;
the TSA position. Only payments outside of the TSA system would be debited. In this way, the&#13;
Treasury system is expected to lead to a more efficient cash management and savings in financing&#13;
of the Government.&#13;
3.12  The Treasury has been structured into central and regional directorates. The central&#13;
directorate would concentrate on policy, regulation and control over the Treasury operations, the&#13;
execution of national cash and debt management, and would provide the executive and&#13;
parliamentary bodies with financial management information for decision making. The regional&#13;
directorates would perform the day-to-day Treasury and accounting services to the government&#13;
agencies in their geographical areas, interface with the local branches of the National Bank of&#13;
Hungary for access to the TSA, and with the central directorate for information exchange.&#13;
3.13 Under a decree of July 1995 and an Amendment of the Act on Public Finance of November&#13;
1995, the Treasury is expected to: (a) enforce a strict relationship between the budget appropriation&#13;
and payments; (b) implement new systems for cash and debt management; (c) eliminate the transfer&#13;
of cash in transactions between government agencies; (d) implement a homogenous accounting&#13;
system and GFMIS to increase the transparency of budget execution and the quality of financial&#13;
information available to government agencies; (e) implement a centralized TSA at the NBH; (f)&#13;
ensure that all government receipts and payments to non-governmental agencies are transacted&#13;
through the TSA; and (g) carry out detailed accounting for agencies connected to the system.&#13;
3.14  The Government has set up a task force in the MOF, headed by a Deputy Secretary of State&#13;
having the rank of Ministerial Commissioner, to fully implement the establishment of the central&#13;
Treasury system. Implementation of the Treasury systems and of the GFMIS is expected to take&#13;
place during 1996-98 with the following major actions:&#13;
*     January 1, 1996 - Adjust legal framework for government financial management;&#13;
adopt required budget and accounting nomenclatures; start operation of the Treasury Single&#13;
Account; absorb all central budgetary institutions and extra budgetary funds into the&#13;
Treasury circle; eliminate cash payments between government agencies, including&#13;
collection of social security tax for public employees; start effecting payments against&#13;
payment orders generated by the CBIs in response to specific vendor invoices, rather than&#13;
by pre-financing agencies in anticipation of such payments. Government institutions would&#13;
maintain detailed accounting records but would assure that accounting is based on the new&#13;
classification system and Treasury management regulations.&#13;
*     January 1, 1997 - Extend the above mentioned measures to other central budgetary&#13;
organizations and public bodies, including the social security institutions; start providing&#13;
detailed GFMIS based accounting and management reporting to the central government and&#13;
its agencies. Government institutions would still retain parallel accounting as a security&#13;
measure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
8&#13;
3.15  According to the original decree, Treasury operations were to be extended to local&#13;
government (municipalities) and public bodies outside the central budget. However, due to the&#13;
legislative complexity involved in the incorporation of local governments into the treasury circle,&#13;
and the specialized nature of the local government financial systems, Government has&#13;
subsequently decided that this issue required more examination. The above-mentioned decree&#13;
was accordingly modified in April 1996, postponing the incorporation of the local governments&#13;
into the Treasury.&#13;
C.   Progress To Date&#13;
3.16 Reforms have progressed substantially since the government decision of July 4, 1995,&#13;
with a number of initiatives proceeding in parallel. These are summarized below.&#13;
3.17  Treasury Operations. The January 1996 actions have been accomplished. The legal and&#13;
policy steps have been implemented according to the timetable. The necessary high level&#13;
amendments to the legal framework have been developed. The changes were approved by&#13;
Parliament in November, 1995. The detailed regulations and procedures necessary for the day-&#13;
to-day operation of a treasury system have been developed.&#13;
3.18 An interim Treasury Ledger System (TLS) has been developed by the Treasury to&#13;
accommodate appropriation accounting for the CBI's and EBF's (absorbed into the Budget) at an&#13;
aggregate level. This system has been implemented from January 1, 1996. Some of the main&#13;
conceptual elements of the treasury system, namely a single account for government operations,&#13;
a centralized ledger system, and a payment system based on payment orders rather than advance&#13;
funding are in place. However, the interim system does not include a number of important&#13;
functions required in a full GFMIS and further conceptual design work is necessary.&#13;
3.19  Budgeting. Work has commenced, with the assistance of the US Treasury, to classify the&#13;
Budget consistent with GFS methodology, and develop a chart of accounts for use in the final&#13;
Treasury System. The central budget preparation process is already well formalized and logical in&#13;
approach.&#13;
3.20  The budget preparation process is supported by a computer-based system capable of&#13;
rapidly collating the figures from ministries (supplied by email, on diskette or on paper) and&#13;
performing re-calculations where necessary. The system is also connected directly to the&#13;
Parliament building to allow changes required by Parliament to be incorporated immediately into&#13;
the database. The Budget Department is in the process of upgrading considerably the IT&#13;
capability (the database software will be significantly enhanced with a move from MICROSOFT&#13;
ACCESS to ORACLE).&#13;
3.21  However, the fiscal information system must be upgraded, so that the final data on&#13;
budgetary chapter revenues and expenditures, including central budgetary institutions and extra-&#13;
budgetary fimds, are made available for the preparation of the annual budget and for effective&#13;
budget execution and control. The Budget Department needs to improve its access to necessary&#13;
information from local governments and from the Social Security Funds. Ultimately, not only the&#13;
Treasury, but also local governments will need to update their information technologies to be able&#13;
to support a proper budget preparation process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9&#13;
3.22 Following recommendations developed under PSAL, the government program also&#13;
acknowledges the need to improve coordination between the budget preparation and budget&#13;
execution areas. This will involve bringing together the development of a budget preparation&#13;
system with the work on the Treasury system. The databases of both budget preparation and&#13;
budget implementation will be constructed on one identical chart of accounts and at the same level&#13;
of detail. Thus, under the Public Financial Management Reform program, the existing databases&#13;
will be consolidated, and compatible operating software systems will be developed and harmonized&#13;
across the Budgeting Department and the Treasury.&#13;
3.23 The IMF has been advising the Government on setting up the Treasury and on key aspects&#13;
of budget preparation and expenditure management over the last two years. The US Treasury&#13;
and the UK Know How Fund are also rendering advice to the Govermment on budget and&#13;
treasury matters. The Bank has been collaborating with both the IMF and the bilateral providers&#13;
of technical assistance to assist the Government in its reforms and in preparing a Public Sector&#13;
Adjustment Loan.&#13;
3.24 Debt Management. The Debt Management Office of the Treasury manages the issue and&#13;
recording of domestic debt. The NBH is currently responsible for external debt management. The&#13;
current set of systems used for management of the issue and recording of domestic debt&#13;
instruments is fragmented. It includes five different groups of information systems to assist in the&#13;
processes of public trading, auction of treasury bills, over-the-counter trading of government&#13;
issues, and to assist in record keeping and analysis of domestic debt data. The Treasury has&#13;
recently completed an analysis of the deficiencies of the current set of information systems to&#13;
assist in the management of domestic debt and has developed a statement of overall functional&#13;
requirements. The Treasury is examining proposals for the design and implementation of an&#13;
integrated system for the management of domestic debt.&#13;
4.    LESSONS OF EXPERIENCE AND BANK STRATEGY&#13;
Lessons Learned&#13;
4.1   Sector experience of the Bank and the Tax Administration Modernization Project (3635-&#13;
HU) in Hungary indicates that projects with a sizable amount of technical assistance and&#13;
information systems investment should: (a) be carefully focused, particularly to provide adequate&#13;
attention to functional design issues prior to computerization issues to ensure effective and efficient&#13;
implementation; (b) have the active support of government and ministry officials, to ensure&#13;
properly considered and timely decision-making on crucial issues; and (c) have a well-defined&#13;
procurement plan including terms of reference for consultants and studies, drafted and agreed with&#13;
the Borrower prior to negotiations.&#13;
4.2   Based on these lessons the Public Finance Management Project will focus on four specific&#13;
areas for which govermnent commitment and financing have been secured. A procurement plan,&#13;
including terms of reference for consultants and studies were drafted and agreed with the Borrower&#13;
prior to negotiations, and finalized during negotiations. Also, given the importance of institutional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
10&#13;
capacity building and information systems in the project, the project team will closely supervise&#13;
handling of the design, procurement and implementation challenges.&#13;
Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
4.3   The project is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Hungary which&#13;
was discussed by the Executive Directors on June 15, 1995. The objectives of the CAS are to&#13;
help Hungary maintain macroeconomic stability and accelerate its growth to facilitate EU&#13;
accession; reform public finance and social policy and strengthen the human resource base; and&#13;
strengthen and privatize Hungary's financial and enterprise sectors. The PFMP will focus on&#13;
reforming the institutional structure of public finance and on the budgeting process. By&#13;
designing and implementing the necessary tools, the project will assist the Government in both&#13;
implementing and monitoring the required measures of the public finance reform. The project&#13;
will also complement the Public Sector Adjustment Loan, which is currently under preparation&#13;
and aims at restructuring Hungary's social expenditures, particularly pension and health care.&#13;
5.    THE PROJECT&#13;
Objectives&#13;
5.1   The overall objective of the project is to assist the Government to optimize the deployment&#13;
and use of its financial resources through changes in the institutional structure of public finance&#13;
and in the budgeting process by:&#13;
(a)   introducing improved methods, guidelines and systems for budget preparation,&#13;
macroeconomic forecasting and, particularly, preparation of forward estimates;&#13;
(b)   ensuring smooth and timely execution of the budget, while minimizing the cost of&#13;
government financing through the newly established Treasury;&#13;
(c)   optimizing the management of public debt; and,&#13;
(d)   designing and setting up coordinating mechanisms, policies, procedures and&#13;
standards that would ensure that the different elements of the Government's Public&#13;
Finance Management (PFM) network can function as an integrated whole.&#13;
5.2   This project would assist the Government in designing and implementing a set of tools to&#13;
enable it to move forward in the implementation of planned changes in the institutional structure&#13;
ofpublicfinance and in the budgeting process.&#13;
Project Description&#13;
5.3   The project focuses on the key initiatives of the Government's program of Public&#13;
Financial Management Reform. The proposed project is organized into four components and&#13;
will provide technical assistance, computer equipment and software to assist the authorities to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
I1&#13;
design, develop and implement processes, procedures, systems, related regulations and training&#13;
programs for:&#13;
(a)   Budget Preparation;&#13;
(b)   Treasury Operations;&#13;
(c)   Debt Management; and,&#13;
(d)   Policies, procedures and standards for the PFM information systems network.&#13;
(a) Budget Preparation (base cost US$0.978 million)&#13;
5.4   For this component, technical assistance would be provided to: (i) develop improved&#13;
methods and guidelines for budget preparation, macroeconomic forecasting and preparation of&#13;
forward estimates; (ii) review the existing budget coding structures, and, if necessary develop&#13;
and design a revised structure and chart of accounts conforming with the GFS and the EU&#13;
classification methodologies and suitable for both budget preparation and implementation; and&#13;
(iii) develop a functional design of systems, processes and procedures for budget preparation.&#13;
The project would then provide technical assistance, computer hardware and software during&#13;
implementation to:&#13;
(a)   implement the revised budget coding structure and chart of accounts for the&#13;
central government;&#13;
(b)   develop detailed regulations and operating manuals;&#13;
(c)   develop the technical design and implement an information system to assist the&#13;
Government in the budget preparation process. This would include incorporating&#13;
modifications to the existing information system for budget preparation so as to ensure&#13;
that it is able to record the budget appropriations in the same form including the use of an&#13;
identical chart of accounts and level of detailed breakdown that is used during the budget&#13;
implementation phase by the treasury system; and&#13;
(d)   design and develop a training strategy and plan for the implementation of the&#13;
revised budget preparation system.&#13;
(b) Treasury Operations (base cost US$3.97 million)&#13;
5.5   Technical assistance is being provided under a PHRD grant to build on prior work done&#13;
by the Govermnent towards the development and implementation of the interim treasury system&#13;
which is now operational. Technical assistance will also be provided to develop the full&#13;
functional design of systems, processes and procedures for expenditure control and treasury&#13;
operations to complete the design of a full function Treasury Ledger System (TLS). Particular&#13;
attention would be paid to incorporating all elements of the expenditure control process,&#13;
including checking for budget appropriations, prior commitment and verification for receipt of&#13;
goods and services, prior to authorizing payment. The necessary detailed regulations and&#13;
operating manuals would also be developed. It is critical that work under the Treasury&#13;
Operations component be closely coordinated with that of the Budget Preparation component and&#13;
that the databases for both systems use an identical chart of accounts to provide for the proper&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
12&#13;
functioning of the budget execution processes. This will be ensured during the design of the&#13;
Treasury system. During implementation, the project would provide technical assistance,&#13;
computer hardware and software to enable the Government to complete the technical design of&#13;
the system and implement the system at the Central Treasury and the Regional Treasury Units.&#13;
(c) Debt Management (base cost US$1.63 million)&#13;
5.6  In this area, technical assistance would be provided to enable the Government to develop&#13;
improved methods, regulations and guidelines for debt recording, reporting and issuance. The&#13;
work would be carried out in close cooperation with the agencies responsible for both domestic&#13;
and foreign debt management to:&#13;
(a)   develop improved methods and functional design of systems for ledgers of&#13;
domestic, foreign and the aggregate public debt, and government sureties and advances;&#13;
(b)   design an appropriate standardization of debt instruments, auction rules and&#13;
calendar of issuance and refunding, for both the foreign and domestic debt; and,&#13;
(c)   develop an action plan that would assist the government debt management offices&#13;
coordinate and optimize their debt policies vis-a-vis the government securities market,&#13;
including further institutional development of the central registries of dealers and&#13;
investors, and surveillance of dealers and audit.&#13;
(d) Public Finance Management Information Systems (PFM-IS) Network&#13;
(base cost US$2.17 million)&#13;
5.7   A number of different systems modules are required to cover the full functionality of a&#13;
Government Financial Management Information System. Figure 1, below, shows the possible&#13;
core elements of a PFM systems network for Hungary and the main information flows between&#13;
elements. This Information Systems Architecture for PFM has been derived by analyzing data&#13;
from a number of countries on public financial management processes and the information&#13;
systems required to support these processes and applying the results to the Hungarian situation.&#13;
The Y-axis lists the main functional processes associated with PFM and the X-axis the&#13;
organizations normally responsible for these processes. Each box in this diagram lies at the&#13;
intersection of the functional process and the organization(s) normally associated with the&#13;
process and may be seen as a information support system for that process. Each such system&#13;
could in practice comprise a number of subsystems. The main information flows between the&#13;
systems modules are also shown in the diagram.&#13;
5.8   More often than not, these systems are implemented as components of separate projects,&#13;
responding to specific needs, with little appreciation of requirements in other areas and little&#13;
thought given to critical interrelationships. The resulting information systems are often disparate&#13;
and segmented with little or no capacity for sharing data. They have overlapping and sometimes&#13;
conflicting functionality and provide incomplete coverage, particularly for managerial&#13;
information requirements, which normally span several functional areas. Once the initial&#13;
framework has been set up and the pre-requisites and criteria for integration have been spelled&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
14&#13;
out and incorporated in the implementation plan, the actual implementation of systems modules&#13;
would be carried out as part of individual projects for respective areas.&#13;
5.9   For this component the project would provide technical assistance to develop policies,&#13;
procedures and standards necessary for ensuring integration between the different elements of the&#13;
information systems network and finance any hardware/software requirements for the&#13;
implementation of these policies, procedures and standards (e.g., implementation of data&#13;
administration standards, acquisition of tools for introducing formal systems development&#13;
methodologies, communication technology for defining and implementing appropriate methods&#13;
of communications between systems modules; etc.). The project would also finance the design&#13;
development and implementation of those items/elements (e.g., common reference files) of the&#13;
network that would need to be developed centrally and the design, development and&#13;
implementation of interfaces, as required, between modules.&#13;
Project Administration Support&#13;
5.10  A unit in the NBH, responsible for coordination of Bank projects, and already staffed&#13;
with personnel trained in Bank procedures for procurement and disbursement, will assist the MOF&#13;
during project execution. Funds have been allocated under the project for additional short-term&#13;
administrative support.&#13;
IMF Coordination&#13;
5.11  The IMF has been extensively involved in advising the Government in the areas&#13;
addressed by the project and the Government has designed its reform program based on these&#13;
recommendations. The Government has expressed a desire to ensure IMF involvement in the&#13;
implementation phases of its reform program. The IMF would accordingly continue to advise&#13;
the MOF/Treasury on the substantive aspects of the Budget Preparation, Treasury Operations and&#13;
Debt Management Systems. A PHRD Grant has been providing funding during the preparation&#13;
and functional design phases to finance technical assistance in budget preparation, accounting&#13;
design, expenditure control, treasury operations and debt management, and for the design and&#13;
development of the computer systems. PHRD grant and project financing would be available to&#13;
the Government for the acquisition of specified services from normal sources of technical&#13;
assistance, including the IMF, subject to contractual arrangements satisfactory to the Bank. The&#13;
Bank would retain the overall supervision responsibilities as well as the supervision of project&#13;
implementation, procurement and disbursement.&#13;
Items to be Financed&#13;
5.12 For each of the components described above, the project would provide financing for&#13;
consultant services, computer equipment, software, telecommunications, support services, and&#13;
technical contract staff capacity for the development and implementation of the budget preparation,&#13;
the Treasury GFMIS and debt management application systems. Details of technical assistance,&#13;
computer hardware and software, services and training are described in the Schedules attached at&#13;
Annexes II and III.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
15&#13;
5.13  Information technology goods consisting of computer hardware (UNIX-type computers,&#13;
PC-type work-stations, associated systems software and telecommunications devices) would be&#13;
contracted as part of an ICB package. Additional areas of contracting would include: (a)&#13;
acquisition of application development tools and DBMS; (b) acquisition/development of&#13;
application software for the budget preparation, treasury operations and debt management&#13;
systems; (c) contract staff for systems development and implementation activities and for initial&#13;
operation of the system; (d) systems integration and auditing services; and (e) training courses, site&#13;
visits for Treasury/MOF finance and information technology staff.&#13;
6.    IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS, ACTIVITIES AND SCHEDULES&#13;
Project Implementation Arrangements&#13;
6.1    A detailed implementation schedule is given at Annex VIII. Implementation arrangements&#13;
related to each project component are described below. These components are expected to be fully&#13;
implemented over a four year period with most activities completed over three years. The Ministry&#13;
of Finance would administer the funds under the project and coordinate project activities. The MOF&#13;
has appointed the Deputy State Secretary, MOF, to serve as the Bank's counterpart for and&#13;
coordinate the activities under this project. A unit in the NBH, responsible for an overall&#13;
coordination of Bank projects, and already staffed with personnel trained in Bank procedures for&#13;
procurement and disbursement, will assist the MOF during project execution and will coordinate&#13;
periodic reporting requirements on project progress (Annexes V and VI). Four teams have been set&#13;
up to implement the reforms in the areas of Budget Preparation, Treasury Operations, Debt&#13;
Management, and to develop and implement policies, procedures and standards across the PFM-IS&#13;
Network, respectively:&#13;
(a)   the MOF Department of State Budget would lead the efforts related to the&#13;
development of the policies, methods, guidelines for budget preparation, including&#13;
methodology and functional requirements for preparing in-advance budgets, revision of the&#13;
chart of accounts, in coordination with the Treasury Department, and the functional design&#13;
of the computer systems required for budget preparation;&#13;
(b)   the Treasury would coordinate the activities related to the development of the&#13;
detailed regulations and the specifications of the processes, procedures and the functional&#13;
design of the systems for expenditure control, cash management and treasury operations;&#13;
(c)   the Debt Management Unit of the Treasury, would direct the Bank assistance in&#13;
developing and implementing policies and information technology for public debt&#13;
management; and&#13;
(d)   activities related to setting up coordinating mechanisms, policies, procedures and&#13;
standards to ensure that the different elements of the PFM systems network interface&#13;
seamlessly would be coordinated from the office of the Deputy State Secretary, MOF.&#13;
6.2   It is recognized that substantive coordination is required in a project of this sort to ensure&#13;
that the new processes, procedures and methodologies for PFM, designed under the project, are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
16&#13;
introduced across government in a coordinated and consistent manner. This type of coordination&#13;
can only be achieved by pro-active participation and guidance from officials at the highest levels&#13;
who are part of the overall government reform effort and are responsible for implementing the&#13;
Government's financial reform program. This type of coordination and guidance is expected&#13;
from the Deputy State Secretary (MOF) in his capacity as the overall project counterpart.&#13;
Project Sustainability&#13;
6.3   The sustainability of the project would largely depend upon the commitment by the&#13;
authorities to the project objectives. As mentioned above, the Government has indicated its&#13;
commitment to the public financial management reform, and set an explicit timetable for the&#13;
implementation of the GFMIS and the treasury system. Work under this project builds on efforts&#13;
already underway in the budget preparation, treasury operations and debt management areas. These&#13;
efforts also give a strong indication of Government commitment.&#13;
6.4   Another critical condition for project sustainability is that the Treasury be able to&#13;
assimilate and retain the transfer of technology. As mentioned above, considerable progress has&#13;
already been achieved by the Government on interim information systems in several areas and&#13;
staff in the MOF/Treasury are familiar with the use of information technology. The project&#13;
would build on existing efforts and supplement technological skills as required.  To&#13;
institutionalize the technology changes smoothly, the PFMP would recruit foreign and local&#13;
specialists and structure training programs for the staffs. The major investment in information&#13;
technology would occur as part of the Treasury Operations component. The project would also&#13;
rely on the Treasury's Information System Project Group to provide the technical skills required&#13;
for systems development and maintenance in this area. For other areas where suitable skills are&#13;
found lacking, the PFMP would permit the MOF/Treasury to recruit and finance technical staff&#13;
from the market, on a consultancy basis. By developing long-term training strategies, the project&#13;
would also ensure sustained institutional support and would extend relevant elements of the&#13;
training program to budgetary chapters, central budgetary institutions and other agencies&#13;
associated with the implemented systems. The increased participation of the local private sector&#13;
in the systems development process would also help ensure sustainability.&#13;
Project Launch, Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
6.5   Tracking key monitoring indicators is necessary to measure the inputs, key process&#13;
milestones, track outputs and assess the impact of the project inputs on the project's major&#13;
development objectives. A comprehensive set of project milestones and performance indicators&#13;
have been developed (Annex VII). These will be used as a basis for monitoring and evaluating&#13;
the project. A project launch work shop would be held in January 1997. A mid-term review&#13;
(June 1998) has been incorporated to assess performance achieved and to review the&#13;
appropriateness and continuing relevance of the project design. The project implementation&#13;
schedule developed along with the Government appears at Annex VIII. Quarterly progress&#13;
reports would be provided to the Bank describing the status of implementation and procurement&#13;
activities. For maximum efficiency, project follow up will be managed from the resident mission&#13;
in Budapest.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
17&#13;
6.6  In view of the significant complexity and difficulty of technical assistance projects of this&#13;
nature, Bank staff and consultant supervision inputs are expected to be high compared to the&#13;
average but comparable to other similar projects. It is estimated that the requirements,&#13;
summarized in the Table 1, will be in the range of 20-25 staff weeks/year. Supervision would&#13;
include: (a) general portfolio management - review of procurement and consultant contracting&#13;
documents, progress reports and correspondence; and (b) formal reviews- participation in the&#13;
mid-term and other reviews; (c) supervision missions. Two supervision missions would be&#13;
necessary annually each for a period of two weeks on average.&#13;

7.    PROJECT FINANCING AND COSTS&#13;
Financing Plan&#13;
7.1   The project cost is estimated at US$10.70 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange&#13;
component of US$6.67 million. The proposed Bank loan of US$7.75 million will finance 72&#13;
percent of the total project costs, 85 percent of foreign exchange and 41 percent of local costs.&#13;
The MOF will finance the balance of project investment costs (about US$2.95 million)&#13;
equivalent, including duties and taxes which are estimated at US$1.91 million equivalent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
18&#13;
Recurrent incremental costs, which comprise equipment operations and maintenance and&#13;
facilities service costs, estimated at US$0.391 equivalent, will be financed entirely by the&#13;
Government. The financing plan is summarized in Table 2. A more detailed breakdown of the&#13;
financing is shown in Annex IV.&#13;
Project Costs&#13;
7.2    Total project costs by project component and by expenditure category are given in Annex&#13;
IV. Total costs, including investment and recurrent costs for the project period, are estimated as&#13;
base costs, plus physical and price contingencies, taxes and duties. Base costs were estimated in&#13;
April 1996, using the experience of other Bank projects in the region, similar activities in&#13;
neighboring countries and detailed input from various Hungarian counterparts (See Annex IV&#13;
for the detailed estimates). Project costs include a physical contingency for unforeseen physical&#13;
variations (US$0.468 million) equivalent to about 5 percent percent of the base cost of all&#13;
project items. Price contingencies are calculated at US$0.865 million. The following rates were&#13;
used to cover expected price escalation: local costs 11 percent for CY 1996-2000; foreign costs&#13;
2.5 percent for CY 1996-2000.&#13;

Shopping may be used for sundry items not exceeding $25,000 per contract up to an aggregate amount of $0.1&#13;
million. Direct contracting for proprietary, time critical or special compatible equipment may be used up ta&#13;
aggregate amount of $0.03 million equivalent subject to Bank's prior review.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
20&#13;
7.4   Procurement of Goods. Equipment contracts which are estimated to cost more than&#13;
US$300,000 equivalent per contract will be procured following international competitive bidding&#13;
(ICB) procedures in accordance with the Bank's "Guidelines for Procurement Under IBRD Loans&#13;
and IDA Credits" January 1995. Equipment procurement has been packaged according to related&#13;
specialized fields. Computer Hardware and Standard Software procured through ICB will&#13;
account for about 85 percent of the total equipment value (US$3.2 million out of a total&#13;
equipment cost of US$3.82 million (excluding duties and taxes). Taxes are estimated at US$1.91&#13;
million equivalent. The remaining 15 percent of the equipment value will be in packages&#13;
suitable for procurement other than ICB. In the comparison of bids for equipment to be procured&#13;
through ICB, local manufacturers, which have established to the satisfaction of the Borrower and&#13;
the Bank that: (i) labor, raw materials and components from within the country of the Borrower&#13;
will account for more than 30 percent of the ex works price of the product offered, and (ii) the&#13;
production facility in which the goods will be manufactured or assembled has been engaged in&#13;
manufacturing/assembling such goods at lease since the time of bid submission, would receive a&#13;
preference in an amount equal to: (i) the amount of duties and other related import charges which&#13;
a non-exempt importer would have to pay for the importation of the goods offered; or&#13;
(ii) 15 percent of the CIF or CIP bid price of such goods if said duties and charges exceed&#13;
15 percent of such price. Appropriate Bank standard bidding documents will be used for&#13;
procurement of goods and equipment. (The General Procurement Notice for the project appeared&#13;
in the July 1996 edition of Development Business Forum).&#13;
Methods other than ICB&#13;
7.5   Limited International Bidding (LIB) &amp; International Shopping (IS). Contracts for&#13;
application software purchase/customization, estimated to cost US$1.50 million equivalent,&#13;
would be awarded under Limited International Bidding procedures in view of the fact that they&#13;
would require specialized software and associated services available from a few sources.&#13;
Procedures for International Shopping will be used for small amounts of equipment where the&#13;
cost of ICB would clearly outweigh possible price advantages. Contracts for equipment not to&#13;
exceed an aggregate amount of US$0.45 million equivalent, and contracts for custom&#13;
development of application software estimated to cost US$0.26 million, will be awarded under&#13;
International Shopping procedures, based on comparing price quotations obtained from at least&#13;
three suppliers from two eligible countries, in accordance with Bank procurement guidelines.&#13;
7.6   National Shopping (NS).  Minor sundry items, such as small lots of information&#13;
technology and office equipment, not exceeding US$25,000 per contract, up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$0.1 million equivalent, could be purchased on the basis of prudent national&#13;
shopping by comparing price quotations obtained from at least three local suppliers, in&#13;
accordance with Bank procurement guidelines.&#13;
7.7   Direct Contracting (DC). Goods and technical licenses which the Bank agrees: (i) are of&#13;
proprietary nature; (ii) the timely supply thereof is critical for efficient project execution; or&#13;
(iii) need to be compatible with other installed equipment, may be procured through direct&#13;
negotiations with property and/or copyright owners, on terms and conditions acceptable to the&#13;
Bank. Such items include contracts for intellectual property such as books, technical journals,&#13;
training materials, audio-visual materials, computer applications software, including annual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
21&#13;
upgrading and licensing arrangements, copyrights, translation and reprinting rights for training&#13;
materials, are estimated to cost under US$30,000 equivalent in the aggregate.&#13;
7.8   Civil Works. Civil works to upgrade facilities to accommodate the information systems&#13;
coming under the project represent an estimated value of US$0.086 million equivalent. These&#13;
will be financed entirely by the Government. Table 1 of Annex VI shows the major procurement&#13;
packages for goods.&#13;
Technical Assistance&#13;
7.9   Qualified firns will be invited to submit proposals for foreign technical assistance (TA)&#13;
in accordance with the "Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by&#13;
the World Bank as Executing Agency", August 1981. Terms of reference for major TA&#13;
components have been drafted and agreed with the Borrower. To keep the evaluation process&#13;
manageable, no more than six (but at least three) proposals will be invited from a shortlist&#13;
acceptable to the Bank. It is anticipated that technical assistance will be procured in packages at a&#13;
total cost of US$1.98 million equivalent. As needed, the services of individual specialists for&#13;
advisory services will be contracted on the basis of shortlists of eligible candidates. Out of the&#13;
total TA, it is anticipated that about US$0.10 million equivalent of the aggregate for technical&#13;
assistance would be for individual specialists.  Table 2 of Annex VI shows the major&#13;
procurement packages for technical assistance.&#13;
7.10 Bank Review. For goods, the Bank shall review the Borrower's procurement plans,&#13;
decisions and procedures in accordance with Appendix 1 of the Guidelines for Procurement&#13;
under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits (January 1995). In particular: (i) each contract estimated to&#13;
cost US$300,000 or more, which will cover all ICB contracts; and (ii) all LIB and all direct&#13;
contracts; shall be subject to prior review, in accordance with paragraph 2 of Appendix 1 of the&#13;
Guidelines. Other goods contracts costing less than US$300,000, shall be subject to post review&#13;
in accordance with paragraph 4 of the Appendix 1 of the Guidelines. For technical assistance&#13;
contracts, the applicable review procedures are discussed in various sections of the Guidelines&#13;
Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by The World Bank as Executing Agency&#13;
(August 1981). Terms of reference for all consulting contracts would require prior review by the&#13;
Bank. Consultants contracts above $100,000 for firms and above $50,000 for individuals would&#13;
require prior review by the Bank. However, for technical assistance contracts under US$100,000&#13;
for firms and under US$50,000 for individuals, the Bank will require prior review of only the&#13;
terms of reference and short-lists of potential consultants.&#13;
Disbursement and Financing Schedules&#13;
7.11  Disbursements. To enable early start-up of the project, retroactive financing up to US&#13;
$775,000 is provided to cover eligible expenses incurred from September 16, 1996, but not later&#13;
than one year from the signing of the loan agreement. Disbursements against contracts for goods&#13;
less than US$300,000 equivalent would be made on the basis of statement of expenditures&#13;
(SOEs). Statement of Expenditures would also be used for all consulting firm contracts less than&#13;
$100,000 and individual consultants contracts less than US$50,000 and for all expenditures on&#13;
training, fellowships and studies. All related SOE documentation would be retained by NBH, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
22&#13;
implementing agency, and made available for subsequent examination by independent auditors&#13;
and Bank supervision missions. The proposed Project is expected to be disbursed over a period&#13;
of five years, which is considerably shorter than the relevant profile in the Region (about seven&#13;
years). The shorter implementation period is possible due to the strong commitment of the MOF&#13;
and generally high level of technical and organizational competency in the relevant agencies.&#13;
The closing date will be June 30, 2001. A summary of the disbursement plan is shown in Annex&#13;
VI (Table 3). Disbursements of World Bank Funds will be made as shown in Table 4.&#13;

Special Account&#13;
7.12 The Borrower will establish and maintain a Special Account (as specified in the Loan&#13;
Agreement) with an authorized allocation of US$700,000. This will be exclusively for making&#13;
payments from the proceeds of the Bank Loan. The initial deposit of the authorized allocation&#13;
will be limited to US$350,000 until the aggregate amount of withdrawals from the Loan Account&#13;
plus the total amount of all outstanding special commitments entered into by the Bank shall be&#13;
equal or exceed the equivalent of US$ 1,000,000:&#13;
(i)   all applications for direct payment or special commitments must be for an amount&#13;
not less than 20 percent of the initial deposit of the authorized allocation to the special&#13;
account or not less than 20 percent of the full authorized allocation once available; and&#13;
(ii)  applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted on a&#13;
monthly basis or when one third of the amount deposited has been withdrawn, which ever&#13;
occurred earlier. Submission of replenishment applications takes precedence over the&#13;
minimum size application as stated in (i) above.&#13;
Audit Timetable&#13;
7.13  Project Audits. Project Accounts and the Special Account will be audited in accordance&#13;
with the Guidelines for Financial Reporting and Auditing of Projects Financed by the World&#13;
Bank (March 1982). The Borrower will provide the Bank (within six months of the end of each&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
23&#13;
fiscal year), an audit report of such scope and detail as the Bank may reasonably request,&#13;
including a separate opinion by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank, on disbursements&#13;
against certified statements of expenses (SOEs). The separate opinion should mention whether&#13;
the SOEs submitted during the fiscal year, together with the procedures and internal controls&#13;
involved in their preparation, can be relied upon to support the related withdrawal applications.&#13;
7.14 Reporting and Annual Reviews. NBH will prepare semi-annual descriptive and financial&#13;
reports on each project component, objective and activity (beginning from the date of Loan&#13;
Effectiveness). The reports will describe: (i) current status; (ii) deviations, if any, from the&#13;
implementation plan; and (iii) the reasons for deviations and corrective actions being taken.&#13;
Reporting and Bank supervision will focus on in-depth reviews of: (i) the emerging policy&#13;
framework; (ii) the effectiveness of component and sub-component activities and their&#13;
consistency with agreements reached at negotiations; (iii) performance of the implementing&#13;
groups and institutions; (iv) emerging needs for adjustments to project parameters; and&#13;
(v) possible follow-up operations which could be supported by the Bank. Bank supervision will&#13;
be based on the semi-annual progress reports and the annual evaluation of project activities by&#13;
the NBH. This will be supplemented by a review of project expenditures and availability of&#13;
financial resources, in addition to substantive discussions with technical assistance groups&#13;
implementing and/or assisting in the implementation of various components, and discussions&#13;
with responsible authorities. A mid-term review of the project is planned for June 1998. This&#13;
Technical Annex will provide the basis for supervision and reporting.&#13;
8.    BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
Benefits&#13;
8.1   The PFMP would lead to substantial financial and economic benefits. By developing the&#13;
central Treasury system and optimizing the budgeting process and debt management, the project&#13;
would contribute to reducing the Government's borrowing needs and costs. Tools and skills&#13;
developed under the project would enable access to timely, accurate and consistent financial&#13;
information to improve resource planning, cash management, budgeting, macroeconomic&#13;
forecasting, and public expenditure management and control. Development and implementation of&#13;
policies, procedures and standards for the PFM-IS network would enable the Government to&#13;
obtain anticipated benefits from the substantial Information Systems/Information Technology&#13;
(IS/IT) investments that are being made in the PFM area.&#13;
8.2  Improvements in the public finance management would promote the capacity to properly&#13;
formulate and execute fiscal policies. Particularly, the consolidation of various information&#13;
databases, consistency in the classification of expenditure items, and an effective system to control&#13;
expenditure and monitor cash flows would enhance transparency and accountability in the fiscal&#13;
processes. Since these are within the direct purview of the state machinery, no alternate approaches&#13;
to reforms appear feasible. The project would, however, explore alternative design strategies to&#13;
enable the Government to decide on the most suitable configuration for the system. The project is&#13;
crucial to the Government Public Financial Management Reformn and to transparency and&#13;
accountability in government operations and its benefits would therefore be far-reaching.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
24&#13;
Risks&#13;
8.3   On the general level, in introducing an improved system of public finance, it may be&#13;
difficult to overcome entrenched positions, attitudes and the many interests, which have benefited&#13;
from financial uncertainties and lack of control. The enactment of the government decree setting&#13;
up the Treasury and the adopted adjustments in the legal framework for government financial&#13;
management have, however, significantly reduced these risks.&#13;
8.4   Among the more specific risks, the project would need to cope with the organizational&#13;
capacities of the MOF to manage the reforms under an extremely tight schedule and coordinate the&#13;
inter-agency activities.  Other risks relate to the technological changes and the subsequent&#13;
requirement on technical skills. To ameliorate these risks the PFMP will provide for: (a) the phased&#13;
implementation of financial systems in a few key areas and building on work already accomplished&#13;
by the Government in these areas; (b) structured development of new systems under the control of&#13;
internationally experienced experts; (c) employment of technically proficient staff within the MOF&#13;
and from the private sector for the technical design, development and implementation of the&#13;
information systems; and (d) training and technical assistance for financial staff within&#13;
Government. There is also a risk that a central organization established with the limited function of&#13;
setting up policies, procedures and standards would interfere with or take over actual project&#13;
implementation for the various information systems projects currently underway in the PFM area.&#13;
This risk would be mitigated by restricting activities under this component to the scope outlined in&#13;
the project documents.&#13;

Page 1 of 12&#13;
Public Finance Management Project&#13;
Design and Implementation of the Government Financial Management Information System&#13;
(GFMIS)&#13;
Structure of the System&#13;
1.  In its ultimate physical configuration, the proposed system would consist of a network of&#13;
computer units of varying capacity, linked by dedicated telecommunication lines. At the core of&#13;
the system would be a central computer unit, located in Budapest within the Ministry of Finance,&#13;
and supported by a few smaller units attached to regional branches of the proposed Treasury. To&#13;
these units would be linked, through the telecommunication network, microcomputers located in&#13;
the government agencies whose funds would be held in the TSA, and whose ledger accounts&#13;
would be kept in the GFMIS. These agencies would include the budgetary chapters, the&#13;
remaining extra-budgetary funds, the social insurance funds and those among the CBIs whose&#13;
volume of operations funded by the budget would appear to justify a direct linkage to the system.&#13;
Over time, the system could be extended to process the operations of the larger local&#13;
governments, even if they were not required to keep their funds in the TSA.&#13;
Functions of the system&#13;
2.   A key characteristic of the proposed system would be that no operation involving a&#13;
movement of public funds could be effected by any government agency linked to the system&#13;
without registering the operation into it. This would ensure that the system provide a&#13;
continuously updated and accurate picture of government financial operations, as they were&#13;
being executed.&#13;
3.   The system could also be designed to process in a speedy and efficient manner the various&#13;
steps for the preparation of the budget. Once the budget had been approved by Parliament, the&#13;
spending limits for each line item of each agency would be registered into the system. The&#13;
system would then control the conformity of each proposed expenditure with the relevant budget&#13;
allocation.&#13;
4.   The implementation of the system would permit a more active and flexible financial&#13;
planning and cash management by the Treasury. The Treasury would prepare rolling at least&#13;
monthly (and preferably more frequent) financial plans, utilizing updated information received&#13;
through the system from the tax and the customs authorities about expected collection of taxes&#13;
and customs duties, and from the other agencies linked to the system about projected own&#13;
revenues and expenditures. On the basis of this information, the Treasury would: prepare and&#13;
execute a program of state budget transfers to each agency's account in the system, within the&#13;
limit approved in the budget and in accordance with the cash needs of the agency; and design and&#13;
update regularly, in close cooperation with the NBH, a program of government debt issues, with&#13;
a view to ensuring that projected net outflows from the TSA (including for the payment of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 2 of 12&#13;
26&#13;
maturing debt) could be financed without excessive and abrupt changes in the balance of the&#13;
TSA.&#13;
5.   The system would control the execution of the budget, ensuring the conformity of payment&#13;
orders registered into it with the relevant budgetary allocation, the prior commitment and&#13;
verification of the expenditure, and that the balance in the agency's ledger account would be&#13;
sufficient to cover the payment.&#13;
6.   The system would be programmed to effect automatically the accounting of each operation&#13;
registered into it. Thus the system would generate complete and up-to-date reports and accounts&#13;
of government operations, for the use of budget managers and of economic policy makers.&#13;
7.   Access to the information generated by the system would, of course, be differentiated&#13;
appropriately, according to the nature of the agency and the level of authority of the individual&#13;
involved. The development of the system would include a careful design of internal controls and&#13;
security routines.&#13;
A possible implementation strategy for the system&#13;
8.   The design of the logical structure of the system; the development and testing of its&#13;
software; the specification, acquisition and installation of the required computer hardware and&#13;
telecommunications lines; and the training of officials in the Ministry of Finance and the&#13;
spending agencies in the use of the system, would require considerable time. The IMF&#13;
recommended a progressive strategy of implementation of the system, beginning with linking to&#13;
it the budgetary chapters, and the extra-budgetary and social insurance funds. The coverage of&#13;
the system could be subsequently expanded progressively to: the main CBIs in Budapest; central&#13;
government spending agencies in other regions; and the larger local governments.&#13;
The Logical Operation of a Treasury Ledger System Within a Government Financial&#13;
Management Information System&#13;
9.    The objective of this section is to illustrate the methodology of a Treasury Ledger System&#13;
(TLS) concept. A full functional analysis and system definition is required to articulate an&#13;
operational system which can be computerized. A full implementation of treasury operations&#13;
will require; first, the development of a TLS to be maintained and operated by the MOF; and&#13;
second, the establishment of a Treasury Single Account (TSA) at the National Bank to&#13;
consolidate the government's monetary assets. In this system the TSA is a government bank&#13;
account to which all receipts are ultimately credited and all payments debited.&#13;
10.   The central Treasury Ledger System serves as the key component, or data base, of the&#13;
Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS), upon which other&#13;
components of a public expenditure management (PEM) process can be built. This modular&#13;
approach to PEM is illustrated in Chart 1. The TLS combined with the Budget Implementation,&#13;
Fiscal Reporting and Debt Management modules is often referred to as a Treasury System, to be&#13;
operated by a Treasury Department.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
Page 3 of 12&#13;
27&#13;
Thus, the TLS will be used by the:&#13;
a.    Budget Preparation Department and subordinate branches, in the course of&#13;
budget preparation; and,&#13;
b.    Treasury Department and subordinate branches, in the course of budget&#13;
implementation (including, particularly, cash and debt management).&#13;
11.   A basic underlying principle is that the system will be built along functional rather that&#13;
organizational lines and will provide support to all organizational units involved in the PEM&#13;
process. This approach has the advantage that it enables the creation of integrated systems and&#13;
data bases in which the primary responsibility for the timely provision of a particular subset of&#13;
data resides with the agency responsible for that function. However, all data in the system data&#13;
bases are accessible by all relevant agencies (subject to appropriate authorizations). This design&#13;
eliminates duplication in data gathering and, more importantly, enables all agencies entrusted&#13;
with financial tasks to work with the same set of data, thereby ensuring consistency of data, a&#13;
frequent deficiency when data are gathered and recorded separately.&#13;
12.   The implementation of these processes could be effected in two ways, depending on the&#13;
linkage of the spending units to the system--direct or indirect.&#13;

13.   Thus, each of the sectors mentioned above will be responsible for the integrity and&#13;
accuracy of the information data base that it maintains within the system. In return each will&#13;
have access to information provided by the other MOF units. The information contained in the&#13;
data bases would also be available to other ministries and government agencies on an "as&#13;
required/approved" basis, to enable them to better manage their financial activities connected&#13;
with approved programs.&#13;
14.   To become a credible source of information for users, such an integrated system would&#13;
need to be comprehensive in terms of coverage and be a source of reliable and timely data. The&#13;
system's data bases would provide the MOF and other central agencies with a foundation for a&#13;
comprehensive management information system related to the State's financial resources.&#13;
15.   The GFMIS, including the TLS database, can also be viewed on a time line. Chart 2&#13;
shows this relationship with year zero (YRO) as the year of budget execution. The GFMIS can&#13;
be designed to contain data relating to a number of years: for historical analysis purposes, for&#13;
budget preparation (including future year estimates called forward estimates) and for budget&#13;
execution. YRO is further expanded in the chart to show key control fields after used in budget&#13;
execution.&#13;
16.   This section addresses in detail only the budget implementation process (those&#13;
components specified under the Budget Implementation Box) and also addresses only&#13;
expenditures in a detailed manner. The budget preparation process can be developed in a similar&#13;
manner, to reflect the operation of the Budget Preparation Module, using the TLS as a database.&#13;
Revenues collected by the tax and customs administration would be recorded at an aggregate&#13;
level in the TLS, I/ and would be reconciled with deposits made in the TSA.&#13;
Execution of budgetary expenditure&#13;
17.   The various budget implementation activities (identified in Chart 1) are summarized in&#13;
information flow terms in Chart 3. The process begins with the MOF recording the approved&#13;
budget (and any amendments thereto) in the TLS by individual appropriation item or revenue&#13;
estimate. Using this as a basis, commitment limits may also be determined, against which&#13;
spending units can make commitments (the commitment stage). A funds allocation limit will be&#13;
determined periodically on the basis of cash availability, to reflect an assessment of budget&#13;
priorities for implementation and entered by the MOF against a suitable aggregation of&#13;
appropriation items. When goods and services deliveries have been made, and bills received, the&#13;
spending unit acknowledges the fulfillment of the commitment and confirms an obligation to pay&#13;
(the verification stage). In the final stage, the spending unit makes (or authorizes) the payment.&#13;
The revenue recording would be at a level of aggregation consistent with the estimates&#13;
presented in the budget documentation.&#13;

Information flow&#13;
18.   The Budget Sector prepares and registers in the TLS the detailed allocation of budgetary&#13;
appropriations by ministry and advises ministries accordingly (flow 1). This process would be&#13;
automatically completed within the system once the Budget Preparation module is fully&#13;
functioning. This would be done within the limits of the appropriation approved by the&#13;
Parliament. The sector may also set and register quarterly limits on commitments by ministry&#13;
(flow 2) and by category of spending (at the level of aggregation deemed appropriate).&#13;
Ministries would then advise their respective spending units of the budgetary appropriations and&#13;
commitment limits and enter the limits in the system).(flow 3).&#13;
19.   Registration of actual commitments would be made in the treasury system by the&#13;
ministries and spending units directly linked (Sud) to the system (flow 4), or by the spending&#13;
units indirectly linked (Sui) in a parallel system through a Regional Treasury Office (RTO) (flow&#13;
5). The Sui will be periodically informed by the RTO of their limits (flow 6).&#13;
20.  In the verification stage, once all the requirements for a particular obligation have been&#13;
met, the spending unit should confirm that the commitment is ready for payment (flow 4, Sud,&#13;
and flow 5, Sui).&#13;
21.  It should be noted that the process outlined above can be simplified for certain types of&#13;
expenditure, either administratively or by automated procedures in the operation of the Treasury.&#13;
For example, salary commitments may be entered only once a year on an estimated basis and&#13;
adjusted as necessary during the year. The commitment (and verification) of small expenditures&#13;
(up to a predetermined limit) could be entered into the system simultaneously with the order for&#13;
their payment. However, the system must know in advance which expenditure items allow such&#13;
simplification, to prevent misuse.&#13;
22.   Commitment control for the current component of the budget can be operated&#13;
satisfactorily on a within year basis, primarily as an aid to sound cash management activities.&#13;
However, in the case of the capital component and major contracts, where the financial life of&#13;
many contracts is more than one year, it is often useful to maintain an accurate record of the&#13;
forward expenditure commitment generated by undertaking the project. If this is done, the&#13;
Government has a better understanding of the flexibility concerning future expenditure decisions.&#13;
This process can be accommodated in the TLS by extending the commitment control stage&#13;
against each capital appropriation line item to cover 2 years beyond the budget year. As long&#13;
term commitments are entered their financial impact is recorded, for the current budget and&#13;
following years.&#13;
23.   To encourage advance planning of larger expenditures, it may be appropriate for the&#13;
MOF to propose limits on cash availability against spending unit expenditure items. These&#13;
would be communicated to ministries by the Treasury Sector (flow 7) in accordance with the&#13;
financial plan, specified by category of spending. Ministries would, in turn, advise spending&#13;
units (flow 7). The advance knowledge of indicative cash limits, as well as of quarterly&#13;
commitments limits, would allow agencies to make the best arrangements (including&#13;
development of appropriate payment schedules within contracts) and to set priorities in a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
AnnexI&#13;
34                                Page 10 of 12&#13;
situation of scarce resources, so that any necessary cuts in planned expenditures could be made in&#13;
a more orderly and effective way. (The proposed cash limits component of the process (flow 7)&#13;
is not shown in the TLS control fields in Chart 2.)&#13;
24.   After taking into account both the balance in the TSA and the balance in spending units'&#13;
expenditure items in the system, the Treasury Sector would make funds allocations (set cash&#13;
limits) to ministries for each category of spending (flow 8), thereby allowing them to distribute&#13;
these financial releases (limits) among their respective spending units and enter the limits in the&#13;
system (flow 9).&#13;
25.   Under ideal circumstances, the allocation of funds would be consistent with the proposed&#13;
cash limits communicated to the ministries earlier (flow 7). Quarterly limits would also be&#13;
consistent with the quarterly commitment levels and the budget appropriation made on an annual&#13;
basis, thereby minimizing the necessity to replan activities. The degree of consistency in the&#13;
process would largely depend on the quality of the initial financial planning process and the&#13;
revenue collection outcome.&#13;
26.   Following the verification for a given expenditure, ministries and spending units directly&#13;
linked to the system (Sud) would record the corresponding payment order in the system (flow&#13;
10). The system would automatically check that the order falls within the funds allocation limit&#13;
set for that Sud by the Treasury Sector. Spending units indirectly linked to the system would&#13;
process a payment order through the RTO (flow 11). The latter would check the payment order&#13;
issued by SUi and register it in the TLS (flow 12).&#13;
Payment arrangements&#13;
27.   At the same time as payment orders are registered in the TLS, the banking system must&#13;
be advised in order to make the necessary payment (that is to transfer funds from the TSA&#13;
account to the creditor). In a fully developed system this can be done automatically. At the end&#13;
of each day, the TLS would structure a file with complete information on the creditors and&#13;
payments to be made, as advised by ministries and spending units. This file would be sent to the&#13;
National Bank, which holds the Government account (flow 13). The National Bank would&#13;
transmit the relevant information (and funds) to each commercial bank (flow 14), to credit to the&#13;
appropriate account (flow 15), and debit the TSA. The National Bank would confirm to the TLS&#13;
the debits in the Government account (flow 16).&#13;
28.   One category of payment is worthy of special mention--namely Civil Service salaries. In&#13;
theory each payment of each civil servant could be treated as a discrete payment and processed in&#13;
the manner already described. However, given the number of individual payments involved, the&#13;
similar structure of each payment, the regular occurrence of payments, and the additional&#13;
personnel issues which need to be considered, it is preferable to develop a separate sub-system for&#13;
processing salary payments-usually referred to a payroll system-in a manner compatible with the&#13;
overall expenditure process.&#13;
&#13;

Computerization aspects&#13;
29.   Computerization of such a budget implementation system through a centrally operated&#13;
TLS needs to take into account the following factors:&#13;
The accounting structure of the TLS should directly reflect the structure of the&#13;
central government budget appropriation items approved by the Parliament. That&#13;
is, there should be a common database and a one-to-one relationship. It should&#13;
contain one item for each head of expenditure (appropriation) in the annual&#13;
Budget Law, each head of receipt, and each refund of receipts;&#13;
*     In many situations, the budget appropriation items will not be detailed enough for&#13;
day-to-day operations and management, and ministries (or spending units) may&#13;
wish to expand the central chart of accounts to allow proper expenditure control&#13;
and transaction processing at a more detailed level. This can be achieved in one&#13;
of two ways. First, the central TLS chart of accounts can be expanded to&#13;
accommodate ministry and spending unit accounting requirements, with all&#13;
transactions carried out as described above. Alternatively, ministries may utilize&#13;
their own accounting (ledger) system, which can be connected to the TLS. This&#13;
would allow much of the detailed transaction processing to take place on the&#13;
ministry system, with only aggregate data consistent with the budget&#13;
appropriation structure transmitted to the TLS; and&#13;
e     The level of existing (or proposed) computerization at the ministries and spending&#13;
units and the associated communication systems will determine the capability of&#13;
units to be directly or indirectly linked to the central TLS. This aspect must be&#13;
addressed early in the system development process.&#13;
Incorporating control processes in the system&#13;
30.   Control and/or certification of the actions of those implementing expenditure proposals&#13;
and making payments is a recognized attribute of any public expenditure management system.&#13;
The Attachment to this paper provides an outline of a control model which would be suitable for&#13;
implementation in the context of a computerized Financial Ledger System described here. Once&#13;
computerized, the TLS is clearly capable of undertaking many of the routine arithmetic checks&#13;
necessary in the process, and can be utilized to 'intervene' at critical points, such as to ensure&#13;
payments from the Government's account do not exceed budget appropriations, or some other&#13;
determined limit, at the line item level. However, there still remains a requirement to confirm&#13;
that certain actions have been performed properly, before any data are registered in the system.&#13;
Control Process in Public Expenditure Management&#13;
31.   The commitment to expend public money should be governed by an explicit set of rules&#13;
and procedures to ensure that expenditures correspond to the amounts and purposes decided in&#13;
the budget--and of course to prevent fraud and abuse. Included in this set of procedures is a&#13;
requirement that a person independent from the preparation stages of the procurement/payment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Annex I&#13;
36                                  Page 12 of 12&#13;
process confirm that correct actions have been taken. This confirmation process should be&#13;
efficient and contain no redundant steps. In the commitment/payment/reporting process three&#13;
clear stages can be identified:&#13;
a.    Before the commitment is made (financial control--commitment stage):&#13;
At this stage, it is necessary to confirm:&#13;
that the proposal to spend money has been approved by an authorized person;&#13;
that the budget has appropriated money for the purpose and sufficient money&#13;
remains available in the proper appropriation category;&#13;
that the expenditure is proposed under the correct category.&#13;
b.    Before payment is made (accounting control--verification stage):&#13;
Before money is withdrawn from the TSA it is necessary to confirm that:&#13;
a valid obligation exists (established after the commitment stage);&#13;
an authorized person has certified that the service has been performed as&#13;
expected;&#13;
the invoice or other document requesting payment is correct and suitable for&#13;
payment; and&#13;
the creditor is correctly identified.&#13;
32.   Other requirements, such as confirmation that staff recruitment intentions are within&#13;
approved limits, or that other specific administrative or special instructions have been complied&#13;
with, may also be added to the control process at the first stage, or may be left to the&#13;
responsibility of the spending agency concerned.&#13;
c.    After final payment is made (audit):&#13;
In the context of certifying the financial reports relating to the financial year in question,&#13;
the Court of Audit would:&#13;
*     examine and scrutinize any or all expenditures or transactions to the extent it&#13;
chooses; and&#13;
*     report any irregularities, in a manner and to whom it considers appropriate.&#13;
33.   To protect against the risk of major fraud or abuse, in addition to application of the&#13;
procurement regulations in force, a special committee can be established to review, before&#13;
commitment, contracts of a value greater than a value set in law or regulation.&#13;

Project Administration Activities to be performed by the MOF/ Treasury&#13;
-     Coordinate day-to-day implementation of tasks under the project by the various&#13;
implementing teams and agencies, as specified in the Project Technical Annex (TA).&#13;
-     Organize monthly meetings with the various project component teams, to review&#13;
progress on project implementation.  Organize and circulate agenda and other&#13;
communications for the meetings. Record the minutes of these meetings. Convey the&#13;
minutes in English, to the World Bank.&#13;
-     Ensure that the Project Teams and evaluation committees have the necessary&#13;
knowledge and expertise to conduct their work, including, for example to draft technical&#13;
specifications and evaluate technical bid proposals. Procure necessary ad hoc TA to&#13;
support these project groups. Also help organize study tours for selected group members&#13;
as appropriate.&#13;
Project Monitoring / Administration Responsibilities to be Performed by the NBH&#13;
The tasks to be performed by the NBH for the project would include:&#13;
-     In accordance with World Bank Procurement Guidelines: Consolidate requests&#13;
for procurement of goods and services. Prepare, in conjunction with project teams,&#13;
procurement documents (e.g., invitations to bid, standard bid documents, technical&#13;
specifications, bid clarification, bid evaluation reports, etc.).  Obtain timely MOF&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The overall objective of the Public
            Finance Management Project (PFMP) is to assist the
            Government to optimize the deployment and use of its
            financial resources through changes in the institutional
            structure of public finance and in the budgeting process.
            The PFMP will focus on the key initiatives of the
            Government's program of public financial management
            reform and will be organized into four components. The
            budget preparation component will assist in development and
            implementation of improvements for budget preparation,
            macroeconomic forecasting and preparation of forward
            estimation, and training staff for the revised budget system
            implementation.  The treasury operations component will
            introduce the Treasury Ledger System, develop effective cash
            management methodologies, and establish revised budget
            execution processes and a new treasury system.  Work under
            the debt management component will involve the development
            of improvements for the recording, reporting and issuance of
            government debt, and a training strategy for the
            implementation of the revised debt management system.  The
            public finance management information systems network will
            put in place policies, procedures and standards that will
            ensure coordination among efforts.
