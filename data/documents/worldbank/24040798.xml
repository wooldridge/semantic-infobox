Box 1.1 What does the input-output table reveal about Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s economy?&#13;
The input-output (I-O) framework provides a comprehensive picture of the flows of goods and services in an&#13;
economy for a given year. Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) constructed the I-O&#13;
framework for 2011 when it rebased the national account in 2014.&#13;
&#13;
The I-O framework reveals the link between the production and expenditure accounts (Box table 1.1.1). On the&#13;
supply side, total output by the agriculture sector was Rwf 1,327 billion, including intermediate inputs of Rwf&#13;
82 billion. Total value added was thus Rwf 1,245 billion. On the demand side, of total output value of Rwf&#13;
1,327 billion, Rwf 414 billion was used as intermediate inputs (including Rwf 32 billion for the agriculture&#13;
sector). Total final demand was thus Rwf 913 billion, of which Rwf 881 billion was domestic and Rwf 26&#13;
billion net external demand. Of total production of Rwf 1,327 billion, Rwf 414 billion (31 percent) was used&#13;
as intermediate inputs; the remaining Rwf 913 billion (69 percent) was for final demand. In the industry sector,&#13;
about 70 percent of total outputs were used for intermediate inputs (including for the industry sector). The share&#13;
of final demand was 31 percent.&#13;

Input coefficients show the shares of intermediate materials of a sector per output (Box table 1.1.2). For the&#13;
economy as a whole, the share of intermediate inputs was 40 percent. This means that out of the total output value,&#13;
40 percent was intermediate inputs and 60 percent gross value added. These ratios differ widely across sectors. The&#13;
intermediate input ratio was high in industry (68 percent) and low in agriculture (6 percent). These figures reflect&#13;
the fact that industry requires many inputs, including imported materials. These figures indicate that an increase in&#13;
agriculture outputs would directly contribute to GDP.&#13;

        In REU-6 the team relied on data published by the National Institute of Statistic Rwanda (NISR) in March 2014. Those data indicated that&#13;
        domestic demand slowed and external demand led the economy in 2013. The September 2014 revision revealed that external demand only&#13;
        marginally contributed to economic growth and domestic demand fully led the economy in 2013.&#13;

1.2 The External Sector: Widening Trade Deficits&#13;
&#13;
Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s formal trade balance in goods deteriorated in 2014, as a result of weak performance in&#13;
traditional export products (primarily coltan) and stronger import demand. Weak export performance&#13;
mainly reflected the sharp fall in international commodity prices. The tourism sector remained the&#13;
largest single source of foreign currency. Strong import demand caused the level of gross international&#13;
reserves to fall in the first half of 2014.&#13;

T    rade in Rwanda is characterized by a highly&#13;
     concentrated export basket and a chronic&#13;
large trade deficit. Goods exports averaged 8.3&#13;

 Box 1.2 Diversifying the export base would reduce the impact of volatility of export prices&#13;
 The growth of goods export slowed to just 4.9 percent in the first 11 months of 2014, down from 18.7 percent in&#13;
 2013. Export values declined in tea, coltan, and wolfram. The declines in tea and wolfram exports were led by&#13;
 price drops; for coltan, both price and volume fell. Coffee, tea, and minerals accounted for 53 percent of goods&#13;
 exports (73 percent excluding reexports). Performance of goods exports thus depends on the export prices of&#13;
 traditional commodities.&#13;

1.3	 Inflation, the Monetary Sector, Exchange Rate Policy, and Financial Sector Development:&#13;
     Growing Credit after a Prolonged Deceleration&#13;
&#13;
Inflation remained low in 2014, as a result of lower import prices, especially for energy and food&#13;
products. Although the Rwandan franc continued to depreciate moderately throughout 2014, Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
import prices remained low, thanks to lower global commodity prices. Economic recovery in the first&#13;
three quarters of 2014 and subsequent improvement in financial sector soundness resulted in the slow&#13;
but steady recovery of credit growth to the private sector since the first quarter of 2014.&#13;

  Box 1.3 What is driving low inflation in Rwanda?&#13;
   Inflation measures changes in the prices of the consumer basket in an economy over time. The consumer basket&#13;
   represents consumption by an average household in a country. Goods and services included in the basket and their&#13;
   weights are determined from the Household Expenditure Survey (commonly known as the EICV).&#13;
   Goods and services in the consumer basket and their weights are revised based on information from the latest&#13;
   EICV. Revisions help avoid potential biases that might otherwise develop over time as a result of new goods and&#13;
   services in the basket or shifts in consumption.&#13;
   The latest revision of the consumer basket of goods and services was made in June 2014. The content and weights&#13;
   were revised based on the EICV-3 and prices rebased at February 2014 prices. These procedures help ensure that&#13;
   the index reflects long-term trends in consumer spending patterns. For instance, the latest revision saw a shift in&#13;
   weights from food and nonalcoholic beverages to imported products (Box table 1.3.1).&#13;

Box 1.3 What is driving low inflation in Rwanda? (continued)&#13;
Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s consumer price index (CPI) contains 1,022 items, grouped into 12 main divisions and classified by origin&#13;
(local or imported). Price information is collected from a variety of places, including shops, markets, hospitals, and&#13;
schools. More than 25,392 prices in urban areas and 8,329 in rural areas are collected every month. In line with&#13;
international practices, the CPI is calculated using modified Laspeyres methods, which allow direct comparison of&#13;
indexes in subsequent years to the base year.&#13;
&#13;
The pace of inflation in Rwanda has been slowing. Box Figure 1.3.1: Movement in Consumer Price Index,&#13;
Headline inflation fell sharply, from more than 2008â&#128;&#147;14&#13;
22 percent in December 2008 to 0.2 percent in       25&#13;
November 2010, before rebounding to nearly 8.5&#13;
percent by end-2011. It has been on a downward path&#13;
                                                    20&#13;
since mid-2012. It fell to 1 percent between August                  Average rate of the&#13;
                                                                      latest 12 months&#13;
and November 2014, hitting a low of 0.2 percent in&#13;
September (Box Figure 1.3.1).&#13;

The 2014 deflationary spiral is not unique to Rwanda:                   10&#13;
most of its major trading partners are experiencing a&#13;
slowdown in inflation (Box Figure 1.3.2). Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
                                                                             Year-on-year&#13;
headline inflation began to decline after most of its                    5   monthly rate&#13;
major trading partners, but its inflation rate has fallen&#13;
substantially since mid-2014, becoming the second                        0&#13;
lowest after the Euro area. Rwanda seems to have                         2008    2009       2010       2011     2012     2013    2014&#13;

&#13;
Although most price indexes fell in 2014, the Box Figure 1.3.2: Inflation in Rwanda and&#13;
main driver of drop in inflation was food products, select trade partners&#13;
particularly vegetables (Box Figure 1.3.3). In October&#13;
2013 food inflation was 8.2 percent and accounted                    Rwanda&#13;
&#13;
for 45.2 percent of headline inflation. A year later, in           UAE (6.7)&#13;
October 2014, food inflation stood at â&#136;&#146;3.3 percent&#13;
                                                                 Kenya (7.0)&#13;
and constituted the main driver of the reduction in&#13;
headline inflation. This downward trend of food prices             India (7.4)&#13;
was led by vegetables, whose average price declined              Japan (10.5)&#13;
13.8 percent between October 2013 and October 2014.&#13;
Vegetables account for 10.1 percent of household               Uganda  (11.7)&#13;
expenditure in Rwanda. The substantial contribution of       Euro Area (15.9)&#13;
food to overall inflation suggests that inflation is largely&#13;

The price of energy, which accounts for almost 8 percent         Bureau of Statistics, and World Bank staff calculations.&#13;
of the CPI basket, also contributed to lower inflation. Note: Trade partners were selected using imports as of 2013.&#13;

Energy inflation has declined steadily since mid-2013.         imports in 2013.&#13;
It has been less than 2.0 percent since December 2013,&#13;
contributing less than 0.02 percentage points on average to annual headline inflation. The decline in energy prices&#13;
is a result of low global demand because of weak economic activity, increased efficiency, and a growing switch&#13;
away from oil to other fuels, together with the fact that the main producers, especially in the Persian Gulf, have&#13;
sustained production.&#13;
&#13;
Lower energy prices are reflected in the revision of domestic fuel prices at the pump. These prices were reduced&#13;
three times in 2014, from Rwf 1,030 (US$1.54) per liter in December 2013 to Rwf 895 (US$1.29) in December&#13;
2014. Domestic fuel prices are administered by a committee, consisting of public and private sector representatives,&#13;
that meets monthly to discuss and determine prices, taking into account trends in worldwide oil prices.&#13;

&#13;
    In addition to its direct effects on the CPI, falling energy prices have indirect effects on inflation. Lower energy&#13;
    prices contributed indirectly to slowing inflation in the services sector, especially in the transportation sector. In&#13;
    November 2014, transportation inflation stood at â&#128;&#147;1.8 percent. Given that transportation services are important&#13;
    inputs into many other sectors, the second-round effect of the decline in energy prices seem to be relevant for&#13;
    overall developments in headline inflation in Rwanda.&#13;
&#13;
    Another important measure of inflation is â&#128;&#156;coreâ&#128;&#157; inflation, which ignores fresh products and energy in Rwanda.&#13;
    This measure is motivated by the fact that food and energy are subject to large fluctuations that inject shocks&#13;
    into CPI inflation signals. Cutting these components eliminates transitory shocks and gives a better indicator of&#13;
    underlying inflation. In most countries, core inflation is used to help guide monetary policy, although inflation&#13;
    objectives are set in terms of the headline CPI. Core inflation in Rwanda oscillated below 3.5 percent in 2014.&#13;

&#13;
Box 1.4 What are nominal and real effective exchange rates?&#13;
Most people are familiar with the nominal exchange rateâ&#128;&#148;the number of units of domestic currency that can&#13;
purchase a unit of foreign currency. On January 30, 2015, the price of US$1 was Rwf 707.23. A decrease in this&#13;
number is termed nominal appreciation of the domestic currency; an increase is termed nominal depreciation. The&#13;
bilateral exchange rate provides information on the relative value of the domestic currency with respect to the&#13;
currency of a single trading partner.&#13;
&#13;
Much research seeks to compare the general trading situations of a number of countries. Indeed, a country may be&#13;
more interested in how the exchange rate is behaving in relation to all its trading partners than in relation to any&#13;
single partner. A countryâ&#128;&#153;s trade-weighted exchange rate, also known as the effective exchange rate, provides this&#13;
information.&#13;
&#13;
The nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) measures the average change in a countryâ&#128;&#153;s nominal exchange&#13;
rate against a number of other currencies during a given period compared with a base year. Unlike the bilateral&#13;
exchange rate, the NEER is an index, not the relative price of one currency with respect to another. It is a weighted&#13;
average of the exchange rates of a country with respect to its major trading partnersâ&#128;&#153; currencies, with the weights&#13;
based on the level of trade with each partner. Series for NEER can be used to compare changes in the terms of&#13;
trade of a number of countries. A country whose NEER is depreciating is trading on worsening terms, as it costs&#13;
that country more to buy goods and services from abroad.&#13;
&#13;
The real exchange rate (REER) is an important refinement of the NEER. A countryâ&#128;&#153;s REER is calculated by&#13;
adjusting its NEER for differences in inflation at home and abroad. It provides a measure of a countryâ&#128;&#153;s export&#13;
competitiveness: a rise in the index implies a fall in competitiveness.&#13;
&#13;
Changes in the NEER and REER depend on three factors. The first factor is the nominal exchange rate. Depreciation&#13;
(appreciation) of the domestic currency relative to trading partnersâ&#128;&#153; currencies entails an increase (decrease)&#13;
in both the NEER and the REER. The second factor is the price level in the country under consideration (the&#13;
domestic price level) and its trade partners. A higher (lower) inflation rate than in a countryâ&#128;&#153;s trade partners leads&#13;
to depreciation (appreciation) of the REER. The third factor is the weights of the major trading partners in the total&#13;
external trade turnover of the country under consideration. The heavier the weight, the greater the impact of the&#13;
exchange rate of that country, as well as the impact of price development on indexes of effective exchange rates.&#13;
&#13;
The choice of countries and relative weights is critical to Box table 1.4.1: Composition of the currency&#13;
the REER. In principle, all countries that trade with the basket in Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s external trade&#13;
country whose competitiveness is being determined should                             Weight in Rwanda's&#13;

usually means that the number of countries taken into&#13;
account is smaller.                                          Uganda                          13.7&#13;

1.4 Fiscal Developments: Remaining Concerns about Capital Expenditure&#13;
&#13;
Total revenue and grants for the 2013/14 fiscal year were almost as projected, but total expenditure&#13;
fell short of projections by 3.7 percent (1.2 percentage points of GDP). Tax revenues were 1.3&#13;
percent lower than projected, offset by higher than projected grants, despite the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s efforts&#13;
to reduce reliance on donor funding under the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF).&#13;
Although structural changes in budget support from budgetary grants to budgetary loans affected&#13;
the composition of grants and financing, the 2014/15 fiscal year budget remains consistent with the&#13;
MTEF, reducing the overall deficit excluding grants. The provisional outturn in the first quarter of&#13;
2014/15 fiscal year, however, reveals that Rwanda continues to suffer from delayed implementation of&#13;
government investment projects.&#13;

expenditure lays the foundations for achieving the                        fiscal year, 60 percent of grants were budgetary&#13;
national goals of accelerating growth and reducing                        grants. In contrast, 60 percent of total grants were&#13;

&#13;
  Box 1.5 Enhancing public investment management is key for achieving national goals&#13;
  Public investment management is very important in Rwanda, because public investment (that is, the development&#13;
  budget) dominates total investment, accounting for two-thirds of total investment in 2013. Development expenditure&#13;
  accounts for about half of the total budget. Enhancing public investment management is expected to contribute to&#13;
  achieving national goals through better alignment with national objectives. As public investment has medium- and&#13;
  long-term fiscal implications through future operation and maintenance costs, public investment management is&#13;
  also essential for fiscal sustainability.&#13;
&#13;
  The National Public Investment Policy of 2009 defined Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s policy on public investment management,&#13;
  but implementation and application of the policy was weak until recently. For example, the Public Investment&#13;
  Committee, which has decision-making authority over the program, was not operationalized until the formulation&#13;
  of the 2014/15 fiscal year budget. Public investment projects were discussed without feasibility studies. Future&#13;
  budget implications were not taken into consideration in formulating the MTEF. Although leveraging the private&#13;
  sector is a key principle of the Second Economic Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy, the National&#13;
  Public Investment Policy does not cover private-public partnerships.&#13;
&#13;
  To address these issues, the government made some reforms in preparing the 2014/15 fiscal year budgetâ&#128;&#148;&#13;
  operationalizing the Public Investment Committee, for example (details are in the first and second planning&#13;
  budgeting call circulars for FY 2014/15 [October 2013 and February 2014]). New investment project proposals&#13;
  now need to be accompanied by project profile documents, three-year investment plans, and feasibility studies.&#13;
  The government also plans to revise the National Investment Policy to cover both public investment and private-&#13;
  public partnerships.&#13;

1.5 Impact of Recent Oil Price Decline on Growth and Poverty: Conflicting Impact on&#13;
	   Growth and Poverty&#13;
&#13;
Crude oil prices measured by Brent declined 53 percent from the peak of US$108 per barrel in&#13;
June 2014 to US$52 per barrel in early January 2015. Unlike after the global financial crisis of&#13;
2009, cheap oil is likely to have a net positive impact on the economy, by supporting macroeconomic&#13;
stability and increased policy flexibility. Direct impacts on the poor will be limited, however, because&#13;
their expenses on energy represent a small share of their consumption basket.&#13;
&#13;

I n the wake of the global financial crisis, oil&#13;
  prices declined 68 percent, from US$134&#13;
per barrel in July 2008 to US$42 per barrel&#13;

  	 Limited data make it difficult to estimate the impact of the decline in oil prices. The Budget Framework Paper for 2014/15 assumes that oil&#13;
    prices decline 6.1 percent in 2014 and 2.4 percent in 2015.&#13;
16&#13;
  	 Fuel taxes are fixed. In the 2014/15 fiscal year, the tax was set at Rwf 183/liter of gasoline and Rwf 150/liter of diesel.&#13;

  	 Data on householdsâ&#128;&#153; purchases of oil products from the EICV3 appear suspect. The team will discuss these data with NISR and update the&#13;

economic performance that surpassed growth                                   has long recognized the importance of agriculture&#13;

  	 NAPâ&#128;&#153;s five areas of focus are (a) ensuring food and nutrition security through the creation of an environment favorable to income generation&#13;
    and the implementation of nutrition interventions; (b) creating a modern, professional, innovative, and specialized agriculture sector that&#13;
    becomes a profitable, all- year-round income-generating activity; (c) creating market-oriented and socially responsible agriculture, targeting&#13;
    domestic, subregional, regional, and international markets; (d) fairly distributing the benefits from all products resulting from different stages&#13;
    of production and processing; and (e) making agriculture integrated, diversified, and environment friendly.&#13;

  	 CAADP aims to help African countries grow faster through agriculture-led development. Its vision is to address policy and capacity issues across&#13;
    agricultural sectors in Africa. CAADP is entirely African led and African owned and represents African leadersâ&#128;&#153; collective vision for agriculture.&#13;

 2.4 Impacts of Risks&#13;
&#13;
 Although systemic risks to agricultural production are low in Rwanda, local and commodity specific&#13;
 risks remain, causing important losses to the sector. Agricultural risks have important consequences&#13;
 for productivity, growth, and the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to transform the sector and meet targets under&#13;
 PSTA 3/CAADP 2. Understanding how frequently risks occur, how much is lost in each risk event or for&#13;
 each crop, and where these losses occur will help policy makers identify and target risk management&#13;
 interventions in a way that has the greatest impact.&#13;

 Box 2.2 How is production loss measured?&#13;
 Estimation of losses as a result of agricultural risks considers primarily production losses caused by weather-related&#13;
 events, such as drought, floods, erratic rains, landslides, and hail; diseases; and pest outbreaks. The following&#13;
 method was applied to calculate production losses in a particular year:&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 A historical linear trend line for yields of each crop Box Figure 2.3.1: Calculation of production losses&#13;
    was constructed.&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 A second linear trend line was drawn, representing       20&#13;
    one-third of the standard deviation of the crop          18&#13;
                                                                                     y = 0.3033x + 5.5697&#13;
    yields.                                                  16                        RÂ² = 0.7238&#13;
 â&#128;¢	 Years were identified as loss years if actual yields     14&#13;
    were below the linear trend line.&#13;

 â&#128;¢	 Production losses were calculated based on the&#13;

2.5 Implications of Structural Shifts and Long-Term Trends&#13;
Long-term trends and structural changes in the agricultural sector could affect the incidence and&#13;
severity of different types of risk. Maximizing productivity and competitiveness in the sector will&#13;
require risk management interventions that take into account the evolving nature of risk.&#13;

Greater demand for livestock products as a result&#13;
of rising income increases the potential impacts&#13;
from food safety risks, as supply chains grow and&#13;
products reach more consumers.&#13;
&#13;
2.6 Risk Management&#13;
Risks may emerge as the sector develops and markets grow. Productivity increases are likely to&#13;
give farmers better access to inputs and the knowledge to mitigate these risks. It is important that&#13;
the appropriate institutions and actors be in place to facilitate this transition. The government and&#13;
development partners fund programs and activities that seek to increase resilience to agricultural&#13;
risks. Businesses, individual farmers, and consumers can adopt other measures, such as dealing with&#13;
higher prices and limited availability of certain commodities by switching to others. A comprehensive&#13;
risk management plan would examine how effective existing activities are and how sufficient their&#13;
coverage is, identify gaps, and consider options for better management practices. A risk management&#13;
plan should identify linkages between risks, prioritize risks, and take into account the feasibility of&#13;
implementing interventions in the Rwandan context, considering budget, institutional, and human&#13;
capacities. Any agricultural risk management plan should support Rwandaâ&#128;&#153;s strategic goals and&#13;
growth objectives for the agricultural sector.&#13;

Box 2.3 What Works in Sub-Saharan Africa? Successful Risk Mitigation Interventions&#13;
Integrated Pest Management (IPM) is an ecosystem approach to pest and disease control that combines different&#13;
management strategies with minimal use of synthetic pesticides. The approach seeks to reduce the incidence of pests&#13;
and disease outbreaks efficiently, keeping the economic costs of both outbreaks and interventions low. Successful&#13;
IPM programs help farmers increase awareness of causal relationships, improve their decision-making skills and&#13;
adopt good agricultural practices (GAPs). In Mali rice farmers participating in IPM interventions registered a 38&#13;
percent increase in yields and a 41 percent increase in net value over conventional farming practices (FAO 2014).&#13;
&#13;
Rainwater harvesting is a water management practice that captures and stores rainfall from roofs, constructed&#13;
catchment surfaces, and streets. The practice can be implemented as a stand-alone intervention or as a complement&#13;
to small-scale irrigation projects. Since drought and erratic rainfall events are expected to increase under climate&#13;
change scenarios, rainwater harvesting is considered a climate-smart adaptation measure. In Burkina Faso and&#13;
Kenya, where competition for water resources among famers and pastoralists is increasingly intense, rainwater&#13;
harvesting projects resulted in net profits of US$150â&#128;&#147;US$600 and US$110â&#128;&#147; US$500, respectively (Ngigi 2009).&#13;
&#13;
Community animal health worker (CAHW) programs provide training and involve counterparts from government&#13;
veterinarian authorities. They have improved livestock disease surveillance and vaccination rates in East&#13;
Africa and the Horn of Africa (Leyland et al. 2014). In countries where national capacity to manage disease&#13;
surveillance information and deliver services is low, CAHWs complement the capacity of government services.&#13;
The most successful programs incorporate a sustainable business model in which CAHWs purchase drugs from&#13;
licensed private pharmacies and are supported by interventions to strengthen regulatory bodies for veterinary&#13;
pharmaceuticals.&#13;
&#13;
Box 2.4 What     strategies do policymakers recommend for integrating agricultural sector risk management&#13;
          in practice?&#13;
In November 2014, policy makers from seven countries in Sub-Saharan Africa gathered with various development&#13;
partners at a Policy Workshop on Agricultural Sector Risk Management to share their experience from integrating&#13;
risk management into their regular agricultural programs. In a working session, participants were asked to jointly&#13;
elaborate comments or recommendations on four issues/questions. Their comments are summarized below:&#13;
&#13;
1. What are barriers to integrated government approaches to managing agricultural risks?&#13;
   â&#128;¢	The structure of agricultural ministries, made up of departments with their own priorities, personalities, and&#13;
     power struggles, creates a barrier to integrated approaches.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	Institutional alignment mechanisms are needed to overcome the lack of coordination between ministries,&#13;
     particularly the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Agriculture.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	Contradictory polices, such as food security policies that keep grain prices low at the expense of farm incomes,&#13;
     can undermine risk management.&#13;
&#13;
2. How can short-term political economy issues be overcome in order to invest in long-term resilience?&#13;
   â&#128;¢	Inter-ministerial coordination and donor coordination should be improved to overcome project-based silos.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	To overcome short-term political realities, governments must create incentive structures for long-term thinking.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	The government should build a critical mass of staff that understand analytical tools and how to apply them.&#13;
&#13;
3. How can ex post humanitarian responses be better integrated with ex ante risk mitigation measures?&#13;
   â&#128;¢	A risk prioritization should be conducted so that mitigation measures can be implemented before high-&#13;
     frequency/high-loss events occur.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	Countries should move away from a project-based approach and coordinate with development partners, who&#13;
     have their own agendas.&#13;
   â&#128;¢	Countries should use sector-wide approaches to encourage an attitude of cooperation rather than competition&#13;
     for resources and control.&#13;
&#13;
4. How can policy makers convince the Ministry of Finance of the relevance of investing in risk management tools&#13;
  and strategies?&#13;
  â&#128;¢	Calculate and share information on the cost of agricultural losses due to major risk events.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	Present budget figures on the cost of coping mechanisms versus the cost of risk mitigation.&#13;
  â&#128;¢	Pursue a cross-ministerial approach to integrated long-term planning and budget reorientation.&#13;

 Box 2.5 What  can Rwanda learn from Nigerâ&#128;&#153;s experience designing and implementing an agricultural&#13;
         risk management program?&#13;
 The World Bank, in collaboration with Nigerâ&#128;&#153;s 3N Initiative, a national food security strategy led by the Presidentâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
 office, conducted an agricultural sector risk assessment in 2012 to help prioritize risks and solutions to building&#13;
 the resilience of Nigerâ&#128;&#153;s agricultural sector. The process resulted in the government of Niger developing the&#13;
 Plan dâ&#128;&#153;action pour la gestion des risquesagricoles au Niger (PAGRA). The 3N Initiative considers the PAGRA&#13;
 a critical tool for long-term planning in Niger, which suffers from frequent shocks and losses from agricultural&#13;
 risks. This 10-year action plan (2014â&#128;&#147;23) sets short-, medium-, and longer-term targets, with the overriding goal&#13;
 of strengthening the resilience of rural and semiurban communities against the main agricultural risks. The Bank&#13;
 is supporting the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to operationalize PAGRA with a US$116 million investment operation. The&#13;
 government of Niger is working toward implementing PAGRA, developing coordinating structures, identifying&#13;
 good practices, planning for scale-up of interventions, setting quantitative targets and identifying target groups, and&#13;
 sharing experiences at different levels of governments. Nigerâ&#128;&#153;s experience of operationalizing risk management&#13;
 could help inform other countriesâ&#128;&#153; efforts toward building resilience.&#13;

            Uncertainty for Growth and Poverty Reduction
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The Rwanda Economic Update reports on
            and synthesizes recent economic developments and places them
            in a medium-term and global context. It analyzes the
            implications of these developments and policies for the
            outlook for Rwanda&#146;s economy. Rwanda&#146;s economic growth
            recovered in the first three quarters of 2014. The economy
            grew 7.1 percent. Faster GDP growth reflected higher growth
            of the services sector, at 9.1 percent, up from 5.4 percent
            in 2013, when the economy suffered from the lagged impact of
            the 2012 aid shortfall. The first section on macroeconomic
            issues of this edition of the Rwanda Economic Update
            examines two key questions: What led to the growth recovery
            in the first three quarters of 2014, and what are growth
            prospects for 2014, 2015, and 2016? The growth recovery
            mainly reflected increased government expenditure, which
            boosted domestic demand such as private consumption and
            investment. The expansion of domestic demand was partially
            offset by lower external demand for Rwanda&#146;s traditional
            commodities. Higher government expenditure contributed to
            growth recovery in the services sector through government
            consumption of private services. Inflation declined
            throughout 2014, reflecting lower growth in import prices.
            The recent decline in oil prices is expected to contribute
            not only to lower inflation but also to more stable exchange
            rate, an improved balance of payments, and smaller
            electricity subsidies. The special focus section of this
            report identifies and quantifies risks in the agriculture
            sector, with targeted interventions that complement the
            lessons learned under PSTA 2/CAADP 1 to more effectively
            manage these risks and to achieve further growth in the
            agriculture sector.
