The Government of Turkey and the World Bank are working in partnership on a program of technical assis-&#13;

hosting communities. This paper was written by Holly Benner, Arzu Uraz, Joanna de Berry, and William Wise-&#13;

            Turkey’s response to the Syrian refugee
            crisis and the road ahead
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Turkey now hosts the largest refugee
            population in the world. The Government of Turkey (GoT)
            estimates the total number of registered Syrians under
            Temporary Protection (SuTPs) at 2,225,147. The objective of
            this policy brief is to collate existing publically
            available material on the situation of SuTPs in Turkey and
            to summarize: (i) the strategy and principles of Turkey’s
            unique response to its displacement crisis; (ii) the
            challenges in managing the socioeconomic dimensions of
            displacement; and (iii) remaining critical policy issues and
            the road ahead for Turkey, as well as implications for other
            countries’ refugee response efforts.
