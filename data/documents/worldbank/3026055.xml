&#13;
I. BACKGROUND&#13;
&#13;
1. In June 1998, IDA approved the Third Structural          Adjustment   Credit (SAC III).&#13;
Its primary objectives were to help improve Cameroon's competitiveness through support&#13;
for:   (a) completing the privatization program, especially with regard to public utilities,&#13;
agricultural parastatals, and the financial   sector; (b) improving    management in the&#13;
forestry sector, with a view to enhancing the sustainable development of this important&#13;
resource; and (c) improving the efficiency of transportation services by reforming the&#13;
transport sector.&#13;
&#13;
2        SAC III is a broad-ranging adjustment operation, supporting significant reforms&#13;
in the forestry sector, the transport sector, as well as a major privatization program of&#13;
state-owned enterprises and services provided by state agencies in many sectors--&#13;
transport, communications, electricity, water and financial services. Of the six tranches&#13;
of SAC III, two are "fixed" and four "floating".   The first of the two cross-sectoral fixed&#13;
tranches was released in September 1998 and the second in June 1999.              The first&#13;
privatization support floating tranche was released in June 2000. Further tranche releases&#13;
were delayed as program implementation slowed from July 2001 to June 2002 because&#13;
some of the proposed sectoral reforms turned out to be more complicated than expected.&#13;
Furthermore, investor interest in some state enterprises to be privatized (fixed telephone,&#13;
primary commodity producers) waned due to global developments such as the rise of the&#13;
mobile telecommunications and the decline in primary commodity prices. Governance&#13;
problems prevailing in Cameroon, which the adjustment program has helped to address,&#13;
also contributed to slowing the reform process.         However, performance has been&#13;
improving    since June 2002, leading notably to the release of the forestry tranche in&#13;
November 2002.&#13;
&#13;
II. RECENT      POLITICAL      AND ECONOMIC        DEVELOPMENTS          AND PROSPECTS&#13;
&#13;
Political and Economic Developments&#13;
&#13;
3.       The political situation remains stable.  The legislative elections in June 2003&#13;
strengthened the control of the country by President Biya's Party, RDPC (R~ssembZeme~t&#13;
Dkmocratique du People Camerounais). Presidential elections are expected in October&#13;
2004.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            -2-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
4       Macroeconomic performance has been satisfactory, although the fiscal situation&#13;
needs careful management as oil revenues are declining.      Real GDP growth in 2003 is&#13;
estimated at 4.2 percent, slightly lower than projected, mainly due to the adverse impact&#13;
of the recurrent electricity shortage. The 12-month average inflation rate declined to 2.8&#13;
percent at end-December 2002 (from 4.5 percent at end-June 2002), reflecting improved&#13;
food supplies. This trend continued during the first semester of 2003 and the inflation&#13;
rate is estimated at 1.2 percent for 2003. In 2002, the primary and overall fiscal surpluses&#13;
were 5.0 percent and 1.3 percent of GDP        respectively, exceeding their targets. This&#13;
outcome was the result of higher-than-projected oil revenue due to higher world oil&#13;
prices, and to lower public spending on investment. In 2003, the Government targets for&#13;
primary and overall fiscal surpluses were 5.7 percent and 1.7 percent of GDP respectively&#13;
and an external current account deficit of 3.1 percent of GDP.&#13;
&#13;
5       The second PRGF program has been on track since the country reached the&#13;
decision point in October 2000. The timetable for the fourth review slipped somewhat&#13;
relative to initial  expectations.   The reasons were largely technical, linked to the&#13;
implementation of the integrated financial management system and the transition towards&#13;
the new fiscal year that matches the calendar year as of January 2003. As a result, the&#13;
Government requested that the period of the PRGF arrangement be extended through&#13;
December 20, 2004. The IMF Board concluded the fourth PRGF review on December&#13;
17, 2003.&#13;
&#13;
6       The Boards of the INIF and the Bank discussed the full PRSP on July 28 and&#13;
July 31, 2003 respectively.    The PRSP, the product of a broad-based consultative and&#13;
participatory process, was based on a detailed poverty profile, the integration of sectoral&#13;
strategies within a coherent, long-term vision to diversify the economy and to reduce&#13;
poverty, and a credible macroeconomic framework.        It provides an ambitious medium-&#13;
term strategy for diversifying the economy and accelerating growth in order to reduce&#13;
poverty.    Agriculture  will continue to drive the economy and support broader rural&#13;
development. The diversification will be towards a more dynamic industrial sector and&#13;
high--value service activities. The central scenario projects steadily rising GDP growth,&#13;
reaching 6 percent in 2007. Stronger non-oil export performance is expected to improve&#13;
the external current account. With increases in public sector capital spending on priority&#13;
sectors, overall investment is projected to reach 19.7 percent of GDP by 2007 from 17.1&#13;
in 2000. The PRSP recognizes that sustained growth performance will require inter ah&#13;
the acceleration of the implementation      of structural reforms, the intensification   of&#13;
investment in human resources and physical infrastructure, and significant improvements&#13;
in governance.&#13;
&#13;
III. PROGRESSUNDER THE STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT PROGRAM&#13;
&#13;
7.      SAC III is a broad-based and complex adjustment operation, supporting reforms&#13;
in the forestry sector, the transport sector, and a major privatization program.        The&#13;
conclusion of SAC III and satisfactory implementation of the reforms it supports is a&#13;
trigger for attaining the HIPC completion point.     As described above, the Government&#13;
has maintained a macroeconomic policy framework conducive to growth and poverty&#13;
reduction and consistent with the objectives of the Program. This section discusses the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                               -3-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
progress in implementing the reforms supported by SAC III in privatization as well as in&#13;
the transport, forestry and finanGia1sectors.&#13;
&#13;
                                   PRIVATIZATION PROGRAM&#13;
&#13;
8        The main development objectives of the privatization             program, the initial&#13;
implementation of which was supported under SAC II (Credit No. 2813-CM), are: (a) to&#13;
improve the availability and quality of infrastructure services through the privatization of&#13;
the major public utilities (water, electricity and telecommunications) and thus mitigate&#13;
the constraints that have hampered growth and poverty reduction; (b) to unleash the large&#13;
growth potential      in the agro-industries by attracting capable investors with            the&#13;
knowledge, access to world markets, and financing required to expand the operations of&#13;
some of the largest companies of the country; and (c) to improve the availability and&#13;
quality of financial services. Two floating tranches of SAC III have focused on the&#13;
privatization program.&#13;
&#13;
9        The First Privatization     Support  Floating Tranche was released in June 2000&#13;
following the fulfillment     of the conditions on privatization transactions involving BICEC&#13;
(a bank), CAMSUCO         (a sugar company), SNEC (the water company), SOCAPALM             (oil-&#13;
palm), SOCAR (an insurance company) and the award of the second mobile telephone&#13;
license.   However, the award of a concession for SNEC could not be completed&#13;
according to the original plan. After a successful bidding process and agreement between&#13;
the Government and the successful bidder on a framework for the concession, the bidder&#13;
notified the Government on July 4, 2003, that it was no longer willing to proceed within&#13;
the agreed framework.           The Government therefore declared the bidding           process&#13;
unsuccessful on September 12, 2003. Since then, the Government, in consultation with&#13;
IDA, has prepared an action plan to re-launch the bidding process and has just published.&#13;
The request for expressions of interest for consultant services to work on proposals for&#13;
the establishment of a public-private partnership in the urban water supply sector in&#13;
Cameroon.      The Government is also preparing the terms of reference for the audit of&#13;
SNEC accounts for the past four fiscal years.&#13;
&#13;
10       The    Second Privatization      Support   Floating   Tranche    contains   conditions'&#13;
regarding CAMTEL          (telecommunications), CDC (agro-industrial conglomerate), CNR&#13;
(reinsurance company) and SONEL (electricity company).&#13;
&#13;
11      CAMTEL. There have been difficulties in the privatization of CAMTEL,             which&#13;
operates the fixed telephone network.         The first round of bidding (pre-qualification),&#13;
launched in July 1999, was disappointing as none of the prospective investors met the&#13;
required criteria. The bidding was re-launched in December 1999 and the technical and&#13;
financial analysis of the bids led to the selection of a successful bidder in December&#13;
2000. However, negotiations could not be successfully concluded and the Government&#13;
entered into negotiations with the second ranked bidder but this also fell through.&#13;
Consequently, in April 2002, the Interministerial Committee for Privatization declared&#13;
the bidding process for CAMTEL              unsuccessful.    The Government has remained&#13;
&#13;
1    Cf. Section IV - Paragraph 31.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                             -4-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
committed    to the privatization   of CAMTEL      and, with the assistance of IDA,       has&#13;
reviewed its strategy for improving the quality of fixed telecommunications services and&#13;
the approach to privatization.    The management of CAMTEL          was brought actively into&#13;
the exercise and the Government adopted a new action plan to improve the quality of&#13;
fixed telecommunications services.&#13;
&#13;
12.     The new strategy and approach envisages:         (a) the active involvement of the&#13;
management of CAMTEL          in the new process; (b) the issuance of an interim cahier des&#13;
charges (interim    license) to CAMTEL        until  its privatization, to allow   for some&#13;
investment to stop its decline in the telecom market; (c) the strengthening of the telecom&#13;
regulatory agency (ART) to monitor CAMTEL's            obligations and performance; (d) the&#13;
revision of the tariffs; (e) the preparation of new business plan for CAMTEL;       and (f) a&#13;
new call for bids would be issued after six months of business plan implementation under&#13;
the cahier des charges. This new approach will have the flexibility     to use various forms&#13;
of public-private partnership in the privatization process. The cahier des charges was&#13;
signed on November        14, 2003, and a minimum          investment plan is now being&#13;
implemented.    Tariffs were revised in November 2003. The terms of reference for the&#13;
preparation of the business plan have been finalized and the consultant has started work&#13;
in January 2004 in order to pave the way for the privatization          of the State-owned&#13;
telecommunications incumbent operator (CAMTEL).          The Government has published the&#13;
request for expression of interest for the recruitment of the investment Bank to assist in&#13;
the sale of CAMTEL.&#13;
&#13;
13      Mobile   Phone.    Two privately-owned mobile phone companies are now fully&#13;
operational. One was spun off from CAMTEL          and the other started operating following&#13;
the award of the second cellular license. The number of chips sold (prepaid cards and&#13;
subscriptions) now exceeds 700,000 compared to less than 3,500 before the privatization&#13;
process began in 1997.        The presence of these two private cellular companies has&#13;
improved services and lowered costs (particularly on international calls).      The telecom&#13;
regulatory agency (ART) is already being called upon to arbitrate between the operators&#13;
and is being supported by technical assistancefrom IDA.&#13;
&#13;
14      SONEL.     The privatization transaction for the electricity company SONEL was&#13;
completed in July 2001. Only one investor presented a bid on November 30, 2000, and&#13;
was designated as successful bidder in February 2001.            However, post-privatization&#13;
performance has been disappointing.       The privatized electricity company has not been&#13;
able to deliver services in the hoped-for combination of quantity and quality owing to&#13;
several factors, including a severe drought during 2001 and 2002. The significant load-&#13;
shedding that occurred has caused economic disruption and public outrage. Efforts are&#13;
now underway by the Government and the new company, with assistance from IDA and&#13;
IFC, to increase generation capacity over time.&#13;
&#13;
15      Cameroon      Development     Corporation    (CDC)     is the major agro-industrial&#13;
complex in Cameroon with four crops (palm oil, rubber, bananas and tea).                 The&#13;
Government decided to put each crop up for sale separately, without excluding the&#13;
possibility of an investor bidding for more than one crop. One bid was received for the&#13;
tea crop on June 29, 2001 and, following           negotiations, the final transaction was&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                                    -5-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
concluded in October 2002. No bids were received for the other crops. The lack of bids&#13;
for the remaining crops can be attributed to the poor performance of the privatization&#13;
advisor and the concerns over the disposition of the long-term contracts between CDC&#13;
and the company currently operating the banana plantations. Furthermore, the political&#13;
sensitivity of this divestiture in the region of the country where the plantations are located&#13;
may have adversely affected investor interest&#13;
&#13;
 16       The Government has decided to recruit new, reputable advisors to: (i) assessthe&#13;
financial value of the banana plantations; (ii) advise on the overall strategy for privatizing&#13;
the three remaining          crops; and (iii)       examine the full     implications      of the legal&#13;
arrangements between the Government and the company operating the banana plantations&#13;
and propose a satisfactory resolution.              A first draft of the report on the financial&#13;
evaluation of the banana plantations was completed in December 2003 and the&#13;
consultants for the two other studies are expected to start work by the end of February&#13;
2004.     In parallel, the Government is about to start the recruitment process of the&#13;
investment banker that would advise on the new round of privatization.                 According to the&#13;
agreed timetable, the bidding documents will be prepared in the second quarter of 2004&#13;
and the bidding process launched in July 2004.&#13;
&#13;
17        CNR.     Despite intense marketing efforts2, the two attempts at privatizing the&#13;
National Reinsurance Company (CNR) proved unsuccessful. Therefore, the decision was&#13;
taken at the end of May 1999 to liquidate the enterprise. The CNR is no longer operating&#13;
and a clause abolishing the legal cession (whereby all insurance companies operating in&#13;
Cameroon were required to reinsure with CNR 10 percent of the value of policies issued)&#13;
was included and adopted in the 2001 budgetary law. While the CNR has defacto been&#13;
liquidated for some time, a few steps remain to be taken to complete the formal process.&#13;
CNR had little       economic justification         and had imposed a high cost on insurance&#13;
companies. Its liquidation has had a positive impact on the insurance industry.&#13;
&#13;
                              TRANSPORT SECTOR REFORM PROGRAM&#13;
&#13;
18       The overall objective of the transport sector reform program is to ensure that the&#13;
sector contributes to growth and poverty reduction through lower transport costs and&#13;
higher quality of services. The adjustment program underlying SAC III encompasses&#13;
institutional,   regulatory and management reforms in the port sector and maritime&#13;
transport as well as in road maintenance, and rail transport.                The conditions for the&#13;
release of the first and second fixed cross-sectoral tranches included the adoption of&#13;
several transport-related measures: (i) the creation of a Road Fund and the establishment&#13;
of its financing mechanism; (ii) the implementation of the Road Fund and its funding&#13;
mechanism; and (iii) the adoption and implementation of a port sector reform plan to&#13;
improve the performance and competitiveness of Cameroonian ports, especially the Port&#13;
of Douala. In this context, the Government has established a National Port Authority,&#13;
four autonomous ports, and consultative committees for each port. The rehabilitation of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2   The latter include several publications in the ~~~~~c~~ZTimes, W~ZZStreet Jo~nal       and Le Monde,&#13;
    letters sent to several international reinsurance companies and the participation, in July 1998, in an&#13;
    international meeting in Monte Carlo between insurance and reinsurance companies.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            -6-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the Port of Douala, including the dredging of the port, is underway and has advanced&#13;
considerably. The conditions for the release of the transport sector support floating&#13;
tranche focus on the institutional and regulatory reforms in the port sector, the transfer of&#13;
industrial and commercial activities in the Port of Douala to the private sector, and the&#13;
reduction of port clearance times.&#13;
&#13;
Roads&#13;
&#13;
19      The operations of the Road Fund, established to secure adequate funding and&#13;
timely disbursement for road maintenance activities by the private sector, have proved&#13;
broadly satisfactory. Funds have been available on a regular basis, and the amount and&#13;
quality of road maintenance financed by the Fund have steadily increased over the last&#13;
three years of its operations.    Based on results achieved by the Road Fund, current&#13;
discussions are focused on the desirability of expanding Road Fund responsibilities to the&#13;
financing of road rehabilitation, and on finding an alternative financing mechanisms&#13;
(notably for HIPC resources) for the roads sector. In addition, implementation of a new&#13;
rural road maintenance strategy has begun.       It includes a training program for rural&#13;
populations and the designation of rural roads that would receive priority in maintenance&#13;
services.    Long-term effectiveness and sustainability of the strategy would require&#13;
progress on this decentralization process. Beyond this, challenges for the road sector&#13;
include finalizing   the roads administration reform, as well as increasing funding for&#13;
maintenance. The level of funding for maintenance, though several times higher than&#13;
before the reform, needs to be raised again to meet the current needs of the network. The&#13;
Government and the donor community are continuing a dialogue on these issues, texts&#13;
have been drafted and the Bank is considering mobilizing additional financing to support&#13;
further progress on these issues.&#13;
&#13;
Ports&#13;
&#13;
20.     Institutional  Reforms.   The port sector law was voted by the November 1998&#13;
session of the National Assembly and promulgated by the President of the Republic on&#13;
December 24, 1998.        The Law (No. 98/021 dated December 24, 1998) and the&#13;
implementation decree (No. 99/127 dated June 15, 1999) provide for the creation of a&#13;
National Port Authority (Autorite' Portuaire Nationale - APN), with responsibility for&#13;
overall management and oversight of the sector, but no operational responsibilities.&#13;
Meanwhile, port operations are placed under the management of Autonomous Port&#13;
Entities (Organismes Portuaires Autonomes - OPAs), with private operators performing&#13;
all commercial and industrial activities. Lastly, the Law and the implementation decree&#13;
(No. 99/129, dated June 15, 1999) provide for the creation of a consultative committee&#13;
within each port. Since the promulgation of the Law and its implementation decrees,the&#13;
APN has been set up and has operated since 2000 in a way consistent with its mandate. It&#13;
has been associated with most of the strategic decisions in the port sector since then, and&#13;
has produced       some   sector analysis   for  the  Government.      Nevertheless,     the&#13;
implementation    of the reform, except for the establishment of the Port A~to~ome de&#13;
Douala (PAD), slowed down between 2000 and 2002. The decrees No. 99/130,131, 132&#13;
and 133 dated June 15, 1999 creating the Ports of Douala, Garoua, Kribi, and Limbe&#13;
were revised in 2002 to reflect the provisions of the OHADA             Uniform     Act on&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Companies. The Government decided by end 2003 to transfer the Port of Garoua to the&#13;
City of Garoua. This development is deemed satisfactory as it confirms that each Port is&#13;
operated separately. The structures in charge of liquidating the former G++ce N~~io~~Z&#13;
des Ports du Cameroun (ONPC) were effectively put in place only in early 2003, and the&#13;
members of the board of directors and the general assembly of the Ports of ICribi and&#13;
Limb6 were appointed by presidential decrees in November and December 2003. The&#13;
Government has yet to fulfill its obligations related to its contribution to the capital of the&#13;
Port of Douala and to its financing of dredging activities. These will be dealt with under&#13;
the framework of the overall public finance dialogue with the Government.&#13;
&#13;
21       The Transfer of the Industrial    and Commercial      Activities and Port Services&#13;
in ;he Port of Douala (PAD) to the Private Sector. Progress has been made in several&#13;
areas, including the maintenance of the access channel, as well as of piers and basins,&#13;
which has consistently been performed satisfactorily through contracts awarded under&#13;
competitive bidding processes. The PAD has retained responsibility for the maintenance&#13;
of the land infrastructure and two bilateral donors (France and Germany) made loans to&#13;
the PAD late in 2002 for the rehabilitation of most of the berths, partly in recognition of&#13;
the institutional reforms undertaken. In early December 2003, the PAD finalized the&#13;
transfer to the private sector of towing and berthing as well as of ice manufacturing. IDA&#13;
staff and the Government have agreed that activities relating to the maintenance of&#13;
navigational aids and piloting should remain under the direct responsibility of the PAD,&#13;
as both have safety implications and are not usually outsourced except if the Authority&#13;
fails to deliver proper service (which was the case at the beginning of SAC III).         The&#13;
PAD has since set up specific accounting of these activities and shown a sustained&#13;
capacity to maintain an adequatelevel of safety in the channel. Since mid-2001, the state&#13;
of operational navigational aids has remained constantly satisfactory, compared to 1999,&#13;
when half of the equipment was out of order.&#13;
&#13;
22       Regarding stevedoring activities, when SAC III was approved in 1998, the&#13;
container terminal did not operate as a separate facility.        Private operators, without&#13;
restriction at entry, were carrying out container operations without gantry cranes. Prior to&#13;
1998, the Government had obtained a credit from Japan to acquire gantry cranes.&#13;
However, there was a disagreement between the donor community              and the PAD on&#13;
whether this was the best option for container operations. When the Government finally&#13;
acquired the cranes in 2001, the issue of the management of the container terminal as a&#13;
distinct facility came to the fore, with the need concretely arising of finding an operator&#13;
for the cranes. The PAD worked out a transitional arrangement whereby it contracted&#13;
several (private sector) stevedoresto operate the cranes. Nevertheless, it was agreedwith&#13;
the Cameroonian Authorities that owing to the significance of the container terminal&#13;
operations, their transfer to the private sector should be carried out on a competitive&#13;
bidding basis, in a manner satisfactory to IDA.        The concessioning process for the&#13;
container terminal was launched in March 2003.           Out of the two bids received, a&#13;
successful bidder was selected. The conduct of the concession process has been judged&#13;
satisfactory to-date by IDA staff. The understanding between the Government and the&#13;
Bank on this issue has constantly been that the completion of this process was not a&#13;
condition of tranche release, but that the process would be monitored as part of the SAC&#13;
III program oversight.      Negotiations with the winning bidder have started and the&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            -8-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
outcome of these negotiations will have a substantial impact on the broader outcome of&#13;
the port reform program on the economy's competitiveness. Due account will be taken&#13;
of this in assessingprogress towards the HIPC completion Point triggers.&#13;
&#13;
23.     Port Costs and Clearance Time.         Since the year 2000, the cost of moving a&#13;
container in Douala has decreased by around 17 percent for a 20-foot container. The&#13;
concessioning of the container terminal that is currently under way should help to sustain&#13;
this downward trend. To speed up transit time and improve transparency in the clearance&#13;
process, the Government set up the Guichet Unique du Commerce Exte'rieur (GUCE),&#13;
which provides a single window to importers and exporters by consolidating all of the&#13;
various services involved     in the import/export    of goods.     A dynamic facilitation&#13;
committee chaired by the private sector was also put in place and now closely monitors&#13;
the efficiency of the port and the clearance operations. One unexpected finding as a&#13;
result of the activities of the GUCE is that clearance time by shippers and their agents&#13;
account for more than half of the average clearance time at the port. Delays in clearance&#13;
time often reflect the time necessary to gather the sums needed to pay customs duties&#13;
and/or the use of the port as a storage area. An action plan has been designed and its&#13;
implementation    has already begun, to sensitize shippers and agents on the actions to&#13;
further reduce delays in clearance activities. The first actions, targeted to large shippers,&#13;
seem to have proven successful, with a reduction of total time by more than two days on&#13;
average in 2003 compared to the other shippers, while their performance was equivalent&#13;
in previous years.&#13;
&#13;
24      As far as the administration and related services (such as shipment inspection&#13;
company, SGS) are concerned, the following trends are observed:&#13;
&#13;
        *   On imports, the average clearance time inside the GUCE has been under&#13;
            seven days over the last ten months and around five days over the last three&#13;
            months. This shows that the clearance time that can reasonably be ascribed to&#13;
            the administration is less than seven days for imports.    It is also noteworthy&#13;
            that the delay associated with the availability of the shipment manifest (which&#13;
            shippers and agentsneed to fill in the clearance form) has been reduced to one&#13;
            day on average.&#13;
&#13;
        *   On exports, the average clearance time through the GUCE is more difficult to&#13;
            capture than for the imports, which has been the main focus of the GUCE&#13;
            work as it gathered most of the complaint of shippers. A survey made by the&#13;
            GUCE in September 2003 shows an average transit time of more than two&#13;
            days for the administrative process (3.38 days exactly based on a sample of&#13;
            more than 1000 shipments), but less than two days for urgent deliveries or&#13;
            perishable goods.    No complaints from shippers indicate that ships were&#13;
            missed because of delayed procedures, which explains the lower attention to&#13;
            exports by the Cameroonian authorities.&#13;
&#13;
25.     The next steps include the computerization of the GUCE and the interconnection&#13;
of all administration services. Work has started by end November 2003 as the contract&#13;
under Al3    (Agence Frcqaise    de De'veloppement) financing was signed in November&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                               -9-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
2003. The upgrade of the Customs system has also started and should bring the entire&#13;
Port clearance system into a modem configuration by the end of 2004, with expectations&#13;
for further cuts in clearance time.&#13;
&#13;
Railways&#13;
&#13;
26       The concession of REGIFERCAM           (the public company) to CAmAIL     (a new&#13;
private company) was concluded in 1999 in the context of the preparation of the Railway&#13;
Concession Project (Credit No. 3695CM).            The Investment Program of CAMRAIL&#13;
includes: (a) the rehabilitation and modernization of rail infrastructure, hydraulic sites,&#13;
sleepers, acquisition of telecommunications materials; (b) the rehabilitation of rolling&#13;
stock and track and the acquisition of maintenance equipment; and (c) the environmental&#13;
and social improvement activities.     It is financed by the French Development Agency's&#13;
private   sector arm    (PROPARCO),        the European Investment     Bank  (EIB),   local&#13;
commercial    banks and IDA.        The project financed by IDA      became effective on&#13;
January 23, 2003. Operational and financial performance is satisfactory. The railways&#13;
are now net contributors to the Government budget through taxes paid, while they were&#13;
subsidized before the concession came in force.&#13;
&#13;
Air Transport&#13;
&#13;
27       With the completion of the legal framework in 1999, Cameroon now has a&#13;
modem Civil Aviation code as well as an autonomous Civil Aviation Authority.           The&#13;
financial  condition of the civil    aviation and airports sector is still fragile, and is&#13;
complicated    by the client-supplier     relationships between the airport management&#13;
company (ADC, de facto controlled by the Government) and state-owned Cameroon&#13;
Airlines  (CAMAIR).      Although a new management was put in place in CAMAIR            in&#13;
2000, the Government has not been successful in restructuring and privatizing the airline&#13;
and it continues to face serious operational and financial challenges, which results in a&#13;
significant drain on the government budget. Air transport costs remain below operating&#13;
costs for domestic flights, and are artificially     high on the sub regional network as&#13;
CAMAIR      is basically in a position of an unregulated monopoly.    The Government has&#13;
appointed a new team in the second semester of 2003 that has prepared, by the end of&#13;
December, an action plan on financial issues.&#13;
&#13;
                                          FORESTRY&#13;
&#13;
28       For the forestry sector, the reforms supported by SAC III have created a policy&#13;
and regulatory environment and an incentive framework conducive to environmentally&#13;
sustainable development for the sector. The reforms and the process leading to these&#13;
reforms continue to have a positive impact on other key areas of the Government&#13;
development agenda: environment, governance, economic management, and poverty&#13;
alleviation.   The SAC III      forestry package included the following    reforms: (i) a&#13;
competitive award of concessions with participation of an independent observer; (ii) a&#13;
national strategy for the allocation of logging rights; (iii) the adoption by the National&#13;
Assembly of major forest sector tax reforms; (iv) the implementation of a forestry tax&#13;
revenue enhancement program that has resulted in increased revenues from the forestry&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            - IO-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
sector; (v) the changes in the distribution of the forest rent to include local populations;&#13;
(vi) the publication    of regulations governing forest management plans; (vii)            the&#13;
establishment of a guarantee system to ensure compliance with management plans; (viii)&#13;
the awarding of contracts for the supervision of forest management and reinforcement of&#13;
the Ministry's   capacity in this area; (ix) the selection of areas to be reserved for&#13;
community forests; and (x) the revision of the statutes of ONADEF (ofice       Natio~aZ des&#13;
For&amp;s)    and its   transformation    into  ANAFOR      (Agence Nationale       d'App~i    au&#13;
De'veloppement Forestier), with a clear mandate and financing mechanisms. Since the&#13;
release of the forestry tranche, IDA has continued to monitor the implementation of&#13;
reforms in this area as part of the monitoring        of the progress towards the HIPC&#13;
completion point triggers. With a more comprehensive body of policies and regulations&#13;
to oversee, and with      more demands from private and public          clients from     local&#13;
communities    and development partners, the Ministry       of Environment     and Forestry&#13;
(MINEF) has recently set up a new team in order to better respond to the challenge of an&#13;
expanded and qualitatively      more demanding workload.           Significant  institutional&#13;
strengthening and ministerial coordination are needed to secure the full and continued&#13;
implementation of the forestry sector reform agenda.&#13;
&#13;
                                    FINANCIAL   SECTOR&#13;
&#13;
29       Under SAC II and SAC III, the banking         and insurance sectors have been&#13;
restructured, with restructuring initiated under SAC II and completed under SAC III.&#13;
Today, all large banks are liquid, solvent and profitable.    Under the first privatization&#13;
support floating tranche of SAC III, BICEC (Banque Zntemationale pour ZeCommerce et&#13;
Z'Epargne au Cameroun), the outcome of a successful split of BICIC                  (Banque&#13;
Intemationale pour le Commerce et 1`Industrie au Cameroun) into a "good" bank and a&#13;
liquidation structure, was privatized.   SOCAR, a state-owned insurance company was&#13;
also restructured in the same way and privatized, while CNR, a state-owned reinsurance&#13;
company, was closed down for lack of business and relevance. The focus of the reform&#13;
effort has now shifted to other financial institutions.    Regional regulations of micro-&#13;
finance establishments     have been developed through an appropriate regional legal&#13;
instrument that was adopted in early 2002. The process of issuing licenses to micro-&#13;
finance establishments has been completed. In this context, over 300 establishments have&#13;
been eliminated from the registry of the Ministry of Agriculture, because they have not&#13;
submitted a request for a license.        The Douala     Stock Exchange       was officially&#13;
inaugurated in April   2003, but transactions have not fully      started yet.  The Social&#13;
Security reform is moving forward, albeit at a slow pace.&#13;
&#13;
IV. PROGRESS AGAINST           THE RELEASE       OF THE REIMMNING           TRANCHES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
30      The   Development     Credit    Agreement    requires    the   maintenance     of   a&#13;
macroeconomic policy framework for growth and poverty reduction consistent with the&#13;
objectives of the Program, satisfactory progress in the implementation of the reform&#13;
program and the fulfillment of specific actions as conditions for the release of the various&#13;
tranches. Bank staff are satisfied that the macroeconomic framework is satisfactory. The&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                           - ll-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
fourth review under the Three-Year A~angement under the Poverty Reduction and&#13;
Growth Facility (PRGF) was concluded by the IMF Board on December 17, 2003.&#13;
&#13;
              THE SECOND PRIVATIZATION        SUPPORT FLOATING     TRANCHE&#13;
&#13;
31      The four specific actions for the release of the Second Privatization Support&#13;
Floating Tranche of SAC III are listed in Part D of Schedule 2 to the Development Credit&#13;
Agreement. These conditions are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
      In accordance with paragraphs 33, 36, 38, 43, and 86 of the Letter of&#13;
      Development Policy (LDP), all bids received for CARTEL,        CDC, CNR and&#13;
      SONEL respectively have been analyzed, and the successful bidders have&#13;
      been selected and invited to enter into negotiations.&#13;
&#13;
The following     paragraphs review    progress on fulfillment    of these specific&#13;
conditions.&#13;
&#13;
32      CAMTEL      (Cameroon Telecommunications).      The condition has been met. The&#13;
bidding process for the sale of CAMTEL       was launched on December 30, 1999. Three&#13;
bids were received, one of which did not meet the bidding criteria.    After evaluation of&#13;
the bids and approval by the Interministerial Committee for privatization, the invitation to&#13;
negotiate was sent to the successful bidder in December 2000.&#13;
&#13;
33.     CDC (Cameroon Development Corporation). The condition has been partially&#13;
met, although the Government took the expected actions toward its fulfillment.          The&#13;
Government has committed       to launching a new bidding process. In view of these, a&#13;
waiver is requested.    After the bidding process was launched, and despite significant&#13;
marketing efforts, only one bid was received for the tea crop unit on June 29, 2001. No&#13;
bids were received for the three remaining crop units, palm oil, rubber and bananas. The&#13;
bid for the tea unit was independently evaluated and then was assessed by the&#13;
Interministerial Committee for privatization.     The successful bidder was invited to&#13;
negotiate in May 2002 and the presidential decree awarding the license to exploit the tea&#13;
crop was signed in October 2002. In summary, the privatization of all CDC activities&#13;
could not be completed as no bidders made offers for three of the four crops.           The&#13;
Government has decided to re-launch the process and with the assistance of IDA, has&#13;
formulated and is implementing a new action plan for the privatization of the remaining&#13;
three units of CDC.&#13;
&#13;
34      CNR (Caisse Nationale de R&amp;assurance). The condition has not been met even&#13;
though the Government        took the expected actions toward       its ful~llment.     The&#13;
change to liquidation,   from the originally    envisioned strategy of privatization,    the&#13;
basis of the formulation   of the conditionality, has nevertheless fulfilled  the intent of&#13;
the required    action.  In view of this, a waiver is requested.       Despite significant&#13;
marketing efforts and two rounds of call for bids in 1998, no bids were received. In the&#13;
circumstances, the Government took the decision to liquidate CNR in January 1999. The&#13;
liquidation of this company, which was imposing a high cost on insurance companies,&#13;
has had a positive impact on the insurance sector.&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                          - 12-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
35      SONEL (Societe Nationale d'Electricite).    The condition    has been met.    One&#13;
investor presented a bid in November 2000. The technical offer received was judged&#13;
satisfactory and the financial offer was considered a good start for negotiations.    The&#13;
investor was selected as successful bidder and the invitation to negotiate was sent on&#13;
February 21, 2001.     Subsequently, agreement was reached with the signature of the&#13;
protocol of sale in July 2001.&#13;
&#13;
                     THETRANSPORTSIJPPORTFLOATINGTRANCHE&#13;
&#13;
36      The three specific conditions for the release of the Transport Support Floating&#13;
Tranche of SAC III are listed in Part E of Schedule 2 to the Development Credit&#13;
Agreement. These conditions are as follows:&#13;
&#13;
        With respect to the port sector, in accordance with paragraphs 65 to 72 of the&#13;
        Letter of Development Policy (LDP), the Borrower has:&#13;
&#13;
        (a)   completed the institutional and regulatory reform measures specified in&#13;
             Part B. 2 (a) (i) and (ii) of this Schedule (i.e., Schedule 2 to the&#13;
             Development Credit Agreement);&#13;
&#13;
        (b)  with respect to the port of Douala, completed the transfer lo the private&#13;
             sector of all commercial and industrial activities (warehousing, stevedoring,&#13;
             freight forwarding,  consignment) as well as port services (maintenance of&#13;
             access and superstructure, towing, piloting,    berthing, ice manufacturing,&#13;
             maintenance of maritime navigational aids,) on a competitive bidding basis,&#13;
              in accordance with procedures satisfactory to the Association; and&#13;
&#13;
        (c) made progress satisfactory to the Association to achieve on average, for    a&#13;
           period of three consecutive months, thefollowing performance indicators for&#13;
           port clearance of containerized merchandise in the port of Douala: 7 working&#13;
            daysfor imports and 2 working daysfor exports.&#13;
&#13;
The following paragraphsreview progress on these specific conditions.&#13;
&#13;
37      Condition   (a) has been met.     The National Port Authority,     APN (Autorite&#13;
Portuaire   Nationale)  is operating in conformity   with its mandate, though greater&#13;
efficiency could be obtained. The organic texts of the Autonomous Port Agencies of&#13;
Douala, Limbe     and Kribi   have been respectively modified      by Decrees 2002063,&#13;
2002064 and 2002/165 dated June 24, 2002. Authority over the Port of Garoua was&#13;
transferred to the City of Garoua by decree 20031335 dated December 9, 2003. The&#13;
Ministry of Transport's Decisions Nos. 01106 and 01107 dated December 4, 2003 have&#13;
respectively determined the geographic circonscription      of the Autonomous Ports of&#13;
Limbe and Kribi.   The members of the board of directors of the Ports of Limbe and Kribi&#13;
were appointed respectively under decrees 2003/3 17 and 2003/320 dated November 14&#13;
and 17, 2003. The members of the college that constitutes the general assembly of the&#13;
Ports of Limbe and Kribi     were appointed respectively under decrees 2003/333 and&#13;
2003/334 dated December 9, 2003. The consultative committees of the four autonomous&#13;
ports have been established under Ministry of Transport Decisions.     The liquidation of&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                            - 13 -&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the former ONPC (Office Notional des Ports du Cameroon) is now being carried out&#13;
under the Minister of Finance's Decision No. 239 dated June 17, 2002.&#13;
&#13;
38       Condition   (b) has been partially    met.  A waiver is proposed in view of a&#13;
departure from the originally    envisioned strategy for piloting and the maintenance of&#13;
navigational aids.&#13;
&#13;
39      All commercial and industrial activities are in the hands of the private sector.&#13;
Warehousing, stevedoring, freight forwarding have always been private and open to any&#13;
company     provided    that  administrative   requirements    are complied    with   under&#13;
Cameroonian legislation.&#13;
&#13;
40      Operations in the Douala Port Container Terrninal (DCT) are currently carried out&#13;
by'private stevedoring companies. These arrangements will be replaced by a concession&#13;
arrangement to be awarded under an ongoing competitive bidding process in order to&#13;
rationalize DCT operations. The completion of the concessioning process is not required&#13;
by specific condition (b) for the release of the Transport Floating Tranche. As mentioned&#13;
above, when Credit No. 3102-CM was approved in 1998, container operations were&#13;
carried out without any gantry cranes.        The operations were carried out by private&#13;
stevedores registered with the Port Authority without restrictions to entry. Therefore the&#13;
transfer of the operations to the private sector was not an issue. When the PAD acquired&#13;
gantry cranes in 2001, the Government and IDA agreed that becauseof the importance of&#13;
container activities in the overall port reform program, container handling operations&#13;
operations should be transferred to an experienced private sector operator through a&#13;
competitive concession process. IDA has monitored the process closely and is satisfied&#13;
with the bidding process and the conclusions of the technical evaluation report.        The&#13;
contract is expected to be signed in March 2004.&#13;
&#13;
41      Among the port services, maintenance of access and superstructure is done&#13;
through contracts awarded regularly on a competitive basis (the next dredging contract&#13;
for the channel is to be awarded by mid-2004).         The maintenance of the container&#13;
terminal equipment is currently done by private stevedoring companies, and will be&#13;
included in the above-mentioned concession of the terminal.      Towing and berthing have&#13;
been awarded under a concession contract and the ice manufacturing unit has been&#13;
transferred to a private company, both on December 3,2003.&#13;
&#13;
42      The Government decided, after consultations with IDA, to have the PAD continue&#13;
to be responsible for the piloting and maintenance of navigational aids, given their safety&#13;
and security implications.   The rationale for seeking divestiture from these two activities&#13;
in 1998 was that, at that time, the port of Douala was extremely inefficient and could not&#13;
be relied on to manage these activities.     Thus, contrary to common practices in other&#13;
ports, it was decided to privatize these two activities.     Over the last five years, the&#13;
management of the now-autonomous PAD has greatly improved, with the assistance of&#13;
IDA and other donors. In that context, the Government decided, and IDA staff agreed,&#13;
that these two activities would remain under PAD management, given their safety and&#13;
security implications.  Based on the steady progress in management by the PAD between&#13;
1999 and 2001, and its maintenance of satisfactory performance with respect to piloting&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
                                              - 114-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
activities and maintenance of navigational aids since 2001, the proposed waiver for these&#13;
two activities is justified.&#13;
&#13;
43       Condition     (c) has been met.   The clearance time for imports attributable to the&#13;
PAD and related administrative activities has been under seven days for the last ten&#13;
months. Export clearance time cannot be measured on a thorough basis, but the average&#13;
transit time inside the export process is around three days but less than two days for all&#13;
perishable goods and urgent deliveries.       The shippers' community has not claimed any&#13;
loss of shipment attributable to delayed processing of export shipments by the&#13;
administration.&#13;
&#13;
VI.  CONCLUSION&#13;
&#13;
44       Overall execution of the Program is satisfactory. The macroeconomic framework&#13;
is consistent with the objectives of the Program and execution is satisfactory:&#13;
&#13;
         (i) Two out of four conditions for the release of the Second Privatization Support&#13;
              Floating Tranche of the Third Structural Adjustment Credit have been fully&#13;
              fulfilled to the satisfaction of IDA. One condition requires a partial waiver&#13;
              and the other condition requires a waiver in view of a departure from the&#13;
              originally envisioned strategy.&#13;
&#13;
         (ii) Two out of three conditions for the release of the Transport Support Floating&#13;
              Tranche of the Third Structural Adjustment Credit have been met to the&#13;
              satisfaction of IDA.    One condition requires a partial waiver in view of a&#13;
              departure from the originally envisioned strategy.&#13;

            Cameroon - Third Structural Adjustment
            Credit Project : Release of the second privatization and
            transport support floating tranches with proposed waivers of
            two conditions and a proposed partial waiver of one condition
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The primary objectives for the project
            were to help improve Cameroon's competitiveness through
            support for: (a) completing the privatization program,
            especially with regard to public utilities, agricultural
            parastatals, and the financial sector; (b) improving
            management in the forestry sector, with a view to enhancing
            the sustainable development of this important resource; and
            (c) improving the efficiency of transportation services by
            reforming the transport sector. The Development Credit
            Agreement requires the maintenance of a macroeconomic policy
            framework for growth and poverty reduction consistent with
            the objectives of the Program, satisfactory progress in the
            implementation of the reform program and the fulfillment of
            specific actions as conditions for the release of the
            various tranches. Bank staff are satisfied that the
            macroeconomic framework is satisfactory. The fourth review
            under the Three-Year Arrangement under the Poverty Reduction
            and Growth Facility (PRGF) was concluded by the IMF Board on
            December 17, 2003. The four specific actions for the release
            of the Second Privatization Support Floating Tranche of SAC
            III are listed in Part D of Schedule 2 to the Development
            Credit Agreement. The three specific conditions for the
            release of the Transport Support Floating Tranche of SAC III
            are listed in Part E of Schedule 2 to the Development Credit Agreement.
