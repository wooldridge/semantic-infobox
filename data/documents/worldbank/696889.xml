Project Objectives:    The project aims to support the extensive decentralization and&#13;
intergovernmental fiscal reforms already instituted by the government by&#13;
providing access to investment financing and technical assistance needed&#13;
for rehabilitation and improved management of municipal services. The&#13;
project's specific objectives are to: (i) improve efficiency and quality of&#13;
public transport services in Riga, improve the financial condition and&#13;
promote further corporatization of the three Riga public transport&#13;
companies; (ii) improve the quality of drinking water in Daugavpils,&#13;
reduce discharge of untreated and partially treated wastewaters to the&#13;
Daugava River and Baltic Sea, improve the financial management and&#13;
promote further corporatization of the Daugavpils water utility; and (iii)&#13;
pursue similar objectives in other communities through financing of the&#13;
Municipal Development Fund (MDF).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ii -&#13;
Project Description:      The project would finance: (i) rehabilitation of the Riga urban transport&#13;
system through provision of priority spares, replacement and repair of&#13;
dilapidated vehicles; introduction of improved financial and operational&#13;
management systems; strengthening of regulatory capability and further&#13;
corporatization of transport enterprises; (ii) construction of a new&#13;
groundwater supply system in Daugavpils, metering, addition of biological&#13;
treatment capacity to the existing sewage works, rehabilitation of pumping&#13;
stations, implementation of improved billing and financial systems,&#13;
improved financial and operational performance and further&#13;
corporatization of the utility; (iii) small scale investment projects in other&#13;
communities throughout Latvia by a Municipal Development Fund (MDF)&#13;
to be established in the Public Investment Program; and (iv) technical&#13;
assistance to support project implementation and agreed policy and&#13;
organizational reforms.&#13;
Project Benefits:         The project supports development of municipal infrastructure, identified as&#13;
a priority in the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy and the Government's&#13;
recent Public Investment Program. The project benefits include: (i)&#13;
increased reliability, comfort and efficiency of public transport systems in&#13;
Riga, improved financial viability of public transport companies, a&#13;
reduced rate of increase in automobile traffic and reduction in the likely&#13;
rate of increase in air pollution; (ii) improved quality and safety of&#13;
drinking water supply in Daugavpils, decreased operating costs,&#13;
introduction of demand management and a reduction in the pollution of&#13;
the Daugava River, Riga Bay, and Baltic Sea; (iii) similar benefits in other&#13;
communities obtaining financing for similar projects through the MDF;&#13;
and (iv) establishment of mechanisms that can be used in the medium term&#13;
for financing future municipal services projects and which can form the&#13;
basis for future efforts to channel funds to the sector.&#13;
Project Risks:            Major risks are that: (i) participating municipalities would not adhere to&#13;
agreed policy conditionality and/or financial and performance covenants&#13;
including provision of counterpart financing; (ii) inability of local&#13;
governments to manage project implementation leading to construction and&#13;
procurement delays; (iii) inability of local governments to prepare&#13;
satisfactory investment proposals for financing under the MDF; and (iv)&#13;
inadequate supervision of MDF projects.&#13;
These risks will be mitigated by: (i) prior agreement with municipalities&#13;
on terms and conditions required for sub-loan effectiveness and, in&#13;
particular, related to financial covenants, organizational arrangements and&#13;
local counterpart financing; (ii) a requirement that sub-loan agreements&#13;
between the participating municipalities and the Ministry of Finance on&#13;
behalf of the Government of Latvia would enable the Ministry of Finance&#13;
to deduct interest and principal repayments from taxes and other revenues&#13;
collected on behalf of local governments by the state tax administration;&#13;
(iii) provision of technical assistance for critical areas of project&#13;
implementation; (iv) adequate staffing of the PMUs for the three primary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iii -&#13;
sub-projects; (v) addition of consultant staff to the PIP unit to assist with&#13;
administration of the MDF and to support municipalities in preparation&#13;
and supervision of projects; and (vi) establishment of a central project&#13;
coordination unit to monitor project implementation.&#13;
Environmental Aspects:   An environmental review for all identified investment components has&#13;
been prepared consistent with the provisions of the World Bank's&#13;
Operational Directive 4.01 on "Environmental Assessment" and in&#13;
accordance with the laws and procedures of the Government of Latvia.&#13;
Appropriate environmental review will also be required of projects to be&#13;
financed under the MDF component of the project.&#13;
The project has a B rating since most of the potential impacts are expected&#13;
to be beneficial. Support of urban transport in Riga will reduce fuel&#13;
consumption and lessen air pollution through replacement and&#13;
rehabilitation of older vehicles and by increasing attractiveness of public&#13;
transport as compared to private automobiles. Development of new&#13;
groundwater supplies in Daugavpils will increase the safety, quality and&#13;
reliability of drinking water supplies. Addition of biological treatment&#13;
facilities at the existing sewage treatment works in Daugavpils and&#13;
conservation of water will reduce pollution of the Daugava River, Riga&#13;
Bay and Baltic Sea. Each of these activities will be monitored and&#13;
evaluated for environmental impact throughout the life of the project.&#13;
Costs and Financing:    Total project cost is estimated at US$45.4 million of which: (i) US$27.3&#13;
million equivalent would be financed by the Bank; (ii) US$2.0 million&#13;
would be financed by NEFCO; (iii) US$9.0 million by grants from EU&#13;
PHARE and the Governments of Sweden, Denmark and Finland; and (iv)&#13;
US$7. 1 million in local counterpart financing.&#13;
Rate of Return:         The economic rate of return (ERR) for the Riga urban transport&#13;
component is estimated at 22%. This represents US$18.7 million or 41%&#13;
of total project costs. The benefits for the Daugavpils water and&#13;
wastewater component are not quantifiable, although assumed to be&#13;
significant given the positive impact on health and enviromnent; least cost&#13;
analysis has been used in determining the appropriate investment program.&#13;
Sub-projects to be financed under the MDF will be required to&#13;
demonstrate an economic rate of return of 12%.&#13;
Participation:          Preparation of the project has been carried out in close cooperation with&#13;
the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development, the&#13;
City of Riga, the Riga public transport companies, the City of Daugavpils,&#13;
the Daugavpils Municipal Enterprise Udensvads, the Public Investment&#13;
Program unit, Ministry of Finance and the Union of Local Governments.&#13;

LATVIA&#13;
MUNICIPAL SERVICES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
A. Country and Sector Background&#13;
1.1           Latvia is a country of 2.6 million people with an area of 25,000 square miles (64,600&#13;
square kilometers). It is situated on the eastern coast of the Baltic Sea and is bounded by Estonia to&#13;
the north, Lithuania to the south, Russia and Belarus to the east and has a 500-kilometer coastline on&#13;
the Baltic Sea.&#13;
1.2          Since the restoration of Latvian independence in 1991, the country has undertaken a&#13;
program of political and economic reforms aimed at achieving a transformation to a market economy.&#13;
A formal macroeconomic stabilization program was launched in July 1992, supported by an IMF&#13;
standby arrangement. A transitional currency, the Latvian ruble, was introduced in 1992 and was&#13;
replaced by the permanent currency, the Lats, in May 1993. The Government has been successful in&#13;
containing monetary expansion and fiscal deficits, though the Government has recently been faced&#13;
with an unanticipated revenue shortfall for 1995. Initial inflation has been brought under control,&#13;
falling from over 900 percent in 1992 to 36 percent in 1994. It is projected to decline to&#13;
approximately 25 percent for 1995. The sharp decline in GDP which occurred during the initial&#13;
adjustment period has been arrested and initial indicators show positive growth in 1995.&#13;
1.3          Structural adjustment in key areas has progressed significantly: (i) most prices have&#13;
been liberalized; (ii) an open trade regime has been introduced and privatization of small businesses,&#13;
agricultural land and banking institutions is well advanced and housing privatization has recently&#13;
commenced; and (iii) the Government is reforming the social safety net through better means-testing&#13;
to target benefits to low-income groups. Banking and industrial sector reforms, however, have been&#13;
slower than initially anticipated. A banking crisis has emerged over the spring of 1995 and will pose&#13;
additional demands on Government resources to fund planned partial compensation of depositors.&#13;
National elections took place in early October 1995. Since no party woIn a commanding lead, another&#13;
coalition government will be created. While the implications for the continuation of the economic&#13;
reform process are not yet clear, there are good indications that major political parties are committed&#13;
to the reform.&#13;
1.4          The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was discussed by the Board in September&#13;
1994. The World Bank's overall objective in Latvia has been shifting from supporting economic&#13;
stabilization and early structural policy measures to deepening structural reforms and promoting&#13;
private and public sector investments. In doing so, the Bank will also support decentralization efforts&#13;
made by the government, in particular, in delegating authority to municipalities in administrative and&#13;
financial decision making. The focus of the Bank's strategy is to: (i) enhance private sector&#13;
development; (ii) improve public infrastructure services and energy conservation; (iii) strengthen the&#13;
social safety net and improve social services; and (iv) address pressing environment concerns.&#13;
Investments in municipal infrastructure and environment have been identified as a priority in the&#13;
Public Investment Program (1995-1997) of the Government; they are also in line with the CAS&#13;
objectives and will be supported by the proposed project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 2 -&#13;
1.5    Although basic coverage by municipal services is relatively high, substantial investment is&#13;
required for rehabilitation and improvement of existing facilities, many of which are in extremely&#13;
poor condition given the lack of maintenance and investment during the adjustment period following&#13;
re-independence and given the already poor state of much plant and equipment. Urban transport&#13;
systems are operating at crush capacity given low vehicle availability, aging fleets and lack of spares&#13;
and new replacement vehicles. Municipal dump sites are nearing capacity and continued operations&#13;
pose a threat to groundwater supplies in many areas. Water quality is poor, distribution systems&#13;
inefficient and wastewater treatment limited. District heating systems are inefficient which leads to&#13;
higher costs and increased burden on local inhabitants. Roads are in poor condition and continue to&#13;
deteriorate.&#13;
1.6           In the present fiscal environment, neither state nor local governments have sufficient&#13;
resources to undertake needed investments out of current revenues, and public investment of all kinds&#13;
has been severely constrained during the adjustment period. At the same time, the borrowing&#13;
capacity of local governments and associated municipal enterprises has increased substantially due to&#13;
reform of intergovernmental fiscal relations combined with substantial increases in user charges and&#13;
continued movement towards cost recovery.&#13;
B. Local Government in Latvia&#13;
1.7            Since re-independence, Latvia has embarked on an ambitious program of&#13;
decentralization, reversing the decades old tendency towards centralization of authority during the&#13;
Soviet period and restoring the more traditional government structures which prevailed during the&#13;
inter-war years. Local governments have become increasingly important and now account for almost&#13;
one half of total public sector spending. They have complete responsibility for the delivery of critical&#13;
municipal services including water supply, sewage treatment, solid waste management, urban&#13;
transport, district heating and maintenance of urban roads. Local governments are also responsible&#13;
for housing and housing maintenance and share responsibility with the central government for health,&#13;
education and social services.&#13;
1.8            There are two levels of local government in Latvia. The first level consists of the&#13;
rural municipalities or pagasts (493) and the town municipalities (69). The second level consists of&#13;
the rajon (district or county) governments (26) and the seven republican cities which have rajon status&#13;
but also perform the functions of municipalities.' First-level local governments are responsible for&#13;
municipal services, housing, primary health care facilities and some social assistance. Second-level&#13;
local governments are responsible for public transport, industrial waste management, clinics, tertiary&#13;
care facilities, old peoples homes and homeless shelters. Responsibility for primary and secondary&#13;
education is shared by the two levels of local government, and teacher salaries are paid by the central&#13;
governments. Republican cities perform the functions of both levels of government. These&#13;
responsibilities and the structure of local government are laid out in the Law on Local Government&#13;
(June 1994).&#13;
1.9            Local governments are democratically elected. Two rounds of elections have been&#13;
held since re-independence, the last being in June 1994. Local government officials are subject to the&#13;
same civil service requirements as the central government and a massive education and skills&#13;
'The seven republican cities are Riga, Daugavpils, Jelgava, Jurmala, Liepaja, Rezekne and Ventspils.&#13;
.1- -                  W   t [ }a UL  v  WtJll A  ULz§11 l11BA 1i 1§11&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
development program  has been launched to enable local leaders to meet their substantially increased&#13;
responsibilities. The program has been led by the Ministry of State Reforms with assistance from the&#13;
Union of Local Government Training Center and the Danish Local Government Association with&#13;
financial support from the EU PHARE program.&#13;
1.10          In contrast to many other countries in transition, the system of revenue assignment to&#13;
local governments is both transparent and objective thanks to a series of reforms in intergovernmental&#13;
fiscal relations adopted over the past two years. Latvia has successfully moved away from a system&#13;
of negotiated transfers to a pure tax assignment model. Local goveinments have been assigned 100%&#13;
of the revenues from the personal income, land and property taxes and also receive a portion of the&#13;
natural resources and forest taxes. Unlike many other countries, the land and property taxes are&#13;
relatively unimportant sources of revenue. The income tax is the major source of local government&#13;
revenue. In all cases, the tax rates and the tax base are determined by the central government with&#13;
little opportunity for local discretion. Given the large income disparity among different regions in&#13;
Latvia and between rural and urban areas, there is partial equalization of revenues to ensure adequate&#13;
funding for minimal service provision in basic services such as health and education.&#13;
1.11          Local government budgets are formed independently according to laws and regulations&#13;
established by the central government. Accounting and reporting requirements are clearly specified in&#13;
the Law on Local Budget and the Law on Budget. These laws also provide for central government&#13;
oversight of local government borrowing and guarantees to ensure prudent financial management until&#13;
local governments gain experience in this area.&#13;
C. Organization of Municipal Services&#13;
1.12          Municipal services (water supply, wastewater collection and treatment, solid waste&#13;
management, public transport and district heating) are delivered primarily by autonomous municipal&#13;
enterprises. These enterprises are wholly owned by the municipality but are separate and independent&#13;
budgetary institutions with independent legal status as provided under the Law on Municipal&#13;
Enterprises (1989). The legal status of municipal enterprises is similar in many respects to that of&#13;
joint stock companies. Municipal enterprises can hire and fire at will, have the right to establish their&#13;
own budgets independently, can borrow and enter into contracts. Though there is no actual board of&#13;
directors, the municipality as the owner of the enterprise appoints and reviews the performance of the&#13;
president. The municipality retains the right to determine user charges; however, it is required to&#13;
compensate the enterprise for losses incurred by failure of the municipality to raise user charges to&#13;
cost recovery levels.&#13;
1.13          During the Soviet period, user charges for municipal services were subsidized to an&#13;
extreme degree. These subsidy programs are no longer affordable and most municipalities have&#13;
already substantially increased user charges for municipal services. In Daugavpils, water and&#13;
sewerage charges increased 10 times between January 1992 and June 1994. In Riga, water and&#13;
sewerage charges increased 20 times during the same period. Similar changes have taken place in&#13;
district heating, urban transport and solid waste collection. In many cases, user charges have been&#13;
increased to a level where they cover basic operating costs; however, in virtually all cases charges do&#13;
not cover costs of maintenance, depreciation or investment. With the exception of public transport,&#13;
most municipal enterprises do not receive any subsidies at all. Continued real increases are still&#13;
required to achieve full cost recovery. And, once that has been reached, there still remains a need to&#13;
ensure periodic increases to compensate for still significant inflation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
1.14           Funding for maintenance and investment are further constrained by massive&#13;
accumulation of arrears for many services. Since all billings are counted as revenues and since no&#13;
allowance is made for bad or doubtful accounts, income for most enterprises is overstated and there is&#13;
substantial pressure on cash flow. In the water sector, the average days receivable can be as high as&#13;
200 to 300 as compared to a target of 30 days or less. There is some evidence of arrears from&#13;
household consumers, but the most significant problem with arrears is with industrial consumers. In&#13;
the case of Riga water, 96% of arrears are due to industry. In the case of Daugavpils water, 61 % of&#13;
arrears are due to a single company. Municipal authorities have hesitated to enforce collection and&#13;
are reluctant to disconnect non-paying or late-paying customers due to the potential political&#13;
ramifications and due to concerns that such disconnection would hasten closure of what in many cases&#13;
are already bankrupt enterprises.&#13;
1.15           The central government provides a small number of individual grants out of the state&#13;
budget to finance selected investment projects, mainly for wastewater treatment projects and school&#13;
construction. These funds are rather limited given the constrained resources of government at all&#13;
levels and are insufficient to fund even a small share of the necessary investments at the local level&#13;
(such grants amounted to only Ls 1.4 million in 1994). Local financial institutions are willing to lend&#13;
to local governments when such loans are secured by commercially attractive property; however, the&#13;
terms are too short and rates are too high to enable local governments to tap into these funds for&#13;
infrastructure investment.&#13;
D. Private Sector Involvement in Municipal Services&#13;
1.16           There is already some private sector involvement in the provision of municipal&#13;
services in Latvia. Solid waste collection services have been privatized in both Riga and Liepaja and&#13;
are now being provided by independent contractors. In Riga, private bus operators provide&#13;
approximately 5% of public transport services. No water or district heating enterprises have been&#13;
privatized or contracted out. In such cases, private sector investment is limited given the hestitation&#13;
of local governments to allow enterprises to charge cost recovery tariffs and guarantee an appropriate&#13;
return on assets.&#13;

II. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Objectives&#13;
2.1           The project aims to support the extensive decentralization and intergovernmental fiscal&#13;
reforms already instituted by the government by providing access to investment financing and&#13;
technical assistance needed for rehabilitation and improved management of municipal services. The&#13;
project's specific objectives are to:&#13;
(a)    improve efficiency and quality of public transport services in Riga, improve the&#13;
financial condition and promote further corporatization of the three Riga public&#13;
transport companies;&#13;
(b)    improve the quality of drinking water in Daugavpils, reduce discharge of untreated&#13;
and partially treated wastewaters to the Daugava River and Baltic Sea, improve the&#13;
financial management and promote further corporatization of the Daugavpils water&#13;
utility; and&#13;
(c)    pursue similar objectives in other communities through financing of the Municipal&#13;
Development Fund.&#13;
B. Origin and Rationale&#13;
2.2          Investment in municipal infrastructure has been identified as a priority in the Public&#13;
Investment Program of the Latvian Government and in the Bank's Country Assistance Strategy. The&#13;
present project was identified in early 1994 after discussions with both central and local govermnent&#13;
officials regarding issues and priorities in the municipal sector. Three priority subprojects were&#13;
identified after discussions with state and local government officials based on their relative priority to&#13;
the local communities, relative priority as compared with other projects within the sector, and&#13;
perceived willingness of local communities to cooperate on a series of policy and operational reforms&#13;
to improve municipal enterprise performance. These are: (i) rehabilitation of Riga urban transport;&#13;
(ii) upgrading of the Daugavpils water and wastewater treatment systems; and (iii) establishment of a&#13;
pilot Municipal Development Fund (MDF). All three subprojects are included in the Public&#13;
Investment Program developed by the Government of Latvia which has been reviewed previously by&#13;
the Bank. Several priority subsectors were considered (including solid waste management&#13;
improvement in Riga but it was decided to consider this under a possible future project) and the three&#13;
were selected because of: (i) the willingness of the communities to undertake significant institutional&#13;
and pricing reforms in the subsectors; (ii) the critical importance of the two subsectors (urban&#13;
transport and water/wastewater) to, respectively, the capital (which contains more than a third of the&#13;
country's population) and the second largest city; and (iii) the potential for improved municipal&#13;
management in smaller communities through the pilot MDF.&#13;
2.3           Riga Urban Transport. Throughout Latvia, the quality of urban transport services has&#13;
seriously deteriorated given a lack of investment in maintenance and investment in the period since re-&#13;
independence. However, the situation is particularly critical in Riga which has a population of&#13;
approximately 860,000 and is the only major city in Latvia. Public transport, upon which 80 to 90%&#13;
of the Riga population are highly dependent, provides infrequent, crowded and unreliable service.&#13;
Many vehicles are idle due to the cost and difficulty of maintaining the aging fleets. Without&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
sufficient cash flow to begin retirement and replacement of aged vehicles, public transport services in&#13;
Riga will be severely compromised, vehicle operating costs will increase and reliability decrease as&#13;
vehicle breakdowns become increasingly frequent. This could hasten the trend toward greater use of&#13;
private cars to the detriment of city traffic conditions and the environment.&#13;
2.4           The majority of public transport services are provided by the three public transport&#13;
enterprises owned by the Riga City Council: bus services are provided by Imanta and Talava and&#13;
tram and trolleybus services by the Tram and Trolleybus Park (TTP). Since re-independence,&#13;
private operators have been free to apply to the municipality for licenses to run public transport&#13;
services in Riga. However, the number of private buses and minibuses in operation has never been&#13;
high, and in recent years has declined to less than 50 small "taxi buses." The lack of interest is&#13;
almost certainly due to poor returns arising from competition with the municipal enterprises which are&#13;
required to keep fares below full cost recovery levels and due to the high cost of credit. In the&#13;
medium-term the municipal enterprises should be privatized after liberalization of fares allows for&#13;
them to become financially viable and after strengthening the regulatory capacity of the existing Riga&#13;
Board of Municipal Services and Transportation (RBMST) to ensure a minimum level of competition,&#13;
safety and coordination of routes.&#13;
2.5           Daugavpils Water and Wastewater. Daugavpils is Latvia's second largest city with a&#13;
population of 120,000 people, the majority of wliich belong to Latvia's ethnic Russian minority. The&#13;
city grew rapidly after the second world war due to rapid industrialization. Presently, Daugavpils&#13;
derives most of its water supply from the Daugava River which is severely polluted by insufficiently&#13;
treated and untreated sewage water discharges upstream in Belarus and Russia. An incident involving&#13;
accidental dumping of cyanide into the water several years ago has made development of groundwater&#13;
resources a top priority. Drinking water does not meet Latvian or EU standards for iron, manganese,&#13;
aluminum or trihalomethanes (THMs), which are a by-product of the chlorination of raw water with a&#13;
high concentration of organics. While the iron and other metals are mainly an aesthetic concern, the&#13;
THMs are carcinogenic compounds. Although the relationship between cancer and THMs in drinking&#13;
water is difficult to prove, the general tendency is to move away from using contaminated or&#13;
otherwise high organic content surface waters for drinking water supply and, instead use groundwater&#13;
or treat water with activated carbon filters and ozonation.&#13;
2.6           The wastewater treatment works are limited to mechanical treatment and do not have&#13;
a biological treatment phase. Daugavpils has been identified, together with Riga and Liepaja, as one&#13;
of the three "hotspots" in Latvia for the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action&#13;
Program prepared under the coordination of the Baltic Marine Environment Protection Commission&#13;
(HELCOM) based in Helsinki. This program was adopted by the Ministers of Environment of the&#13;
Baltic Sea region, including Latvia, in April 1992. The proposed rehabilitation of the Daugavpils&#13;
wastewater treatment works would reduce the discharge of untreated and partially treated sewage and&#13;
would have a positive environmental impact on nearby beaches and recreational areas, the River&#13;
Daugava, the Riga Bay and the Baltic Sea. Daugavpils is the only remaining "hotspot" in Latvia as&#13;
improvements in wastewater treatment are being made with the support of the Bank under the Liepaja&#13;
Environment Project and improvements in wastewater treatment for the City of Riga are being&#13;
contemplated with the support of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).&#13;
2.7           There are no immediate plans for privatization given the poor financial performance&#13;
of the Daugavpils Municipal Enterprise Udensvads (DMEU); this is due mainly to failure of the&#13;
municipality to allow imposition of user charges sufficient for full cost recovery. Substantial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
improvement in financial performance, depoliticization of user charge determination and an increase&#13;
in the regulatory capacity of the municipality should result from the project and should elicit an&#13;
increase in private sector interest and involvement over the medium term.&#13;
2.8           Establishment of a Pilot Municipal Development Fund. Although Riga and the larger&#13;
cities are able to access loan financing for rehabilitation of municipal infrastructure from international&#13;
financing agencies such as the World Bank, most municipalities are not of sufficient size to justify&#13;
direct involvement. Investment needs in these communities remain unfunded or receive support&#13;
directly from the state budget. Such funding from the state budget is extremely limited and there is&#13;
no local lending at rates and terms appropriate for financing infrastructure investment. Establishment&#13;
of a Municipal Development Fund will enable the Government to channel loan funds from&#13;
international financing agencies to communities unable to borrow directly and will reduce dependence&#13;
on grants from the state budget for investments with primarily local benefits.&#13;
2.9           Preparation of feasibility studies for the major project components was initiated with&#13;
the assistance of a Japanese Policy and Human Resources Development Grant, the EU PHARE, and&#13;
the Ministry of Economic Affairs of the Netherlands. At the same time, the Bank initiated a program&#13;
of formal and informal sector work in local government finance to assess the viability of the&#13;
municipal finance framework in Latvia and its impact on local government borrowing capacity and&#13;
development of municipal services. This has formed the focal point for an ongoing policy dialogue&#13;
with the government on these issues and has been supported by a longer-term program of assistance&#13;
by US Treasury representatives in Latvia and the Danish Association of Local Governments whose&#13;
activities in local government training and civil service reform are being sponsored under the EU&#13;
PHARE program.&#13;
C. Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
2.10         Involvement of the Bank will foster introduction of requisite policy reforms,&#13;
institutional development, financial and operational improvements needed to ensure sustainability of&#13;
project investments and creditworthiness of beneficiaries. Since investment financing of the&#13;
magnitude required is not available from other donors (except EBRD in the case of Riga water, see&#13;
para 2.6), Bank participation will provide critically needed investment financing and help mobilize&#13;
limited resources from other donors and financiers.&#13;
D. Lessons Learned from Past Operations&#13;
2.11          The Municipal Development Sector Review (R-94171 dated August 22, 1994) notes&#13;
that a critical factor in the long-term development of urban services is the existence of satisfactory&#13;
intergovernmental fiscal relations. This issue has received substantial attention in the preparation of&#13;
the project. A municipal finance study was prepared and released to the government for discussion as&#13;
a technical note. This study found that reform of intergovernmental fiscal relations in Latvia has&#13;
moved quite rapidly and that the municipal finance framework is more than adequate to support the&#13;
project and long term development of the sector. (See also "Latvia: Local Government Expenditures&#13;
and Resource Transfers.") Other municipal projects have also demonstrated the importance of cost&#13;
recovery to sustainability, the need for financial covenants to ensure enterprise viability and the need&#13;
for operational reforms to increase efficiency (including billing and collections, maintenance and&#13;
operations practices and demand management).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8 -&#13;
2.12          Loans made to Latvia to date include a Rehabilitation Loan, the Agriculture&#13;
Development Project, the Enterprise and Financial Sector Restructuring Project, the Liepaja&#13;
Environment Project and the Jelgava District Heating Project. These projects have demonstrated the&#13;
value of targeted technical assistance to facilitate procurement, construction supervision and&#13;
implementation of institutional strengthening programs as well as policy reforms. These projects have&#13;
also shown the need to size investments in accordance with affordability considerations.&#13;
E. Project Description&#13;
Riga Urban Transport&#13;
2.13          New Buses. Many of the buses held by Imanta and Talava are too old for economic&#13;
use. The purchase of 36 new articulated buses (18 each) and the disposal of 95 of the oldest buses (49&#13;
Talava, 46 Imanta) would reduce the age profile of their fleets, would permit maintenance staff&#13;
reductions and would effect substantial maintenance cost savings. Enhanced reliability of the fleets&#13;
would improve ticket revenue and would decrease passenger waiting times. Replacement of older&#13;
vehicles would result in decreased emissions and greater fuel economy.&#13;
2.14          New Trolleybuses. Many of the trolleybuses held by the Tram and Trolleybus Park&#13;
(TTP) are too old and too small for economic use. The purchase of 30 new large and more energy&#13;
efficient articulated trolleybuses will permit the disposal of some 56 of the oldest and small&#13;
trolleybuses with no loss of passenger carrying capacity. Also since the fleet is larger than required&#13;
to meet the needs of peak operation, it will be possible to remove an additional 37 uneconomic&#13;
trolleybuses from service. The overall benefits will be a reduction in drivers and maintenance staff&#13;
(to be accomplished through attrition), and substantial savings in maintenance costs and energy&#13;
consumption. Since the new trolleybuses will be able to use the existing overhead power transmission&#13;
system, the marginal costs are equivalent to those of new buses.&#13;
2.15          Tram Electrical Equipment. The majority of TTP tramns use outmoded traction control&#13;
systems which are unreliable and do not make the most effective use of energy. The purchase of 60&#13;
thyristor chopper traction control systems, suitable for the newer trams in the fleet, will produce&#13;
energy savings, reduce down-time, reduce maintenance of accelerator units, and increase reliability&#13;
leading to increased ticket revenue.&#13;
2.16          Capital Repair Programs. A review of the Imanta and Talava bus fleets undertaken&#13;
by consultants found many buses to be in poor condition but not sufficiently bad to justify expensive&#13;
replacement in light of current financial performance. Instead, it is proposed that 80 buses at each&#13;
enterprise should be rehabilitated making use of existing maintenance staff and repair facilities, and&#13;
the purchase of the necessary spares and materials as part of the project. The program is expected to&#13;
extend the life of these buses by 5 years and postpone the need for new buses. In the meantime&#13;
rehabilitation will reduce maintenance cost and improve reliability leading to extra revenue. TTP&#13;
already undertakes a limited program of capital repairs. The provision of spares and materials will&#13;
enable this program to make badly needed improvements to bodywork structures.&#13;
2.17          Spare Parts. All three enterprises suffer from a serious shortage of spares. As a&#13;
result many vehicles are out of service for long periods. Some spares are made in their own&#13;
workshops; however, most have to be imported. The enterprises, with the help of consultants, have&#13;
drawn up schedules of vital spares. The purchase of these spares by the project for general&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
maintenance and capital repairs will improve reliability and reduce the wasteful down-time of vehicles&#13;
leading to reduced costs and increase passenger revenues.&#13;
2.18          Relocation of Imanta Workshop. The Imanta maintenance facilities are located on&#13;
three separate sites. This leads to inefficient control of staff and is wasteful of resources as vehicles&#13;
have to be shunted from site to site at additional cost. The project provides for the closure of one of&#13;
the sites and the building of a new workshop at the main depot.&#13;
2.19          Workshop Plant and Equipment. Some of the plant and equipment used by the&#13;
enterprises is fully depreciated and needs replacement. Schedules and specifications have been drawn&#13;
up with the help of consultants. The new plant and equipment will increase operational efficiency,&#13;
reduce manpower requirements, and increase reliability leading to increased revenue.&#13;
2.20          Training and Technical Assistance. The project will provide the Riga City Council&#13;
and the three public transport enterprises with training and technical assistance to: (i) facilitate&#13;
implementation of the project including procurement; (ii) oversee a pilot program to evaluate&#13;
proposed implementation of a new ticketing system; (iii) oversee implementation of agreed action&#13;
plans; and (iv) support capacity building of the Public Transport Unit (PTU) and its implementation&#13;
of policy reforms agreed to and enacted by the Riga City Council in the attached Public Transport&#13;
Policy Statement (Annex A). The City of Riga has agreed to implement all measures outlined in&#13;
the Public Transport Policy Statement including payment of compensation due to the public&#13;
transport companies in connection with concessionary fares that may be required from time to&#13;
time by the City of Riga. [para 6. 1(a)]&#13;
Dau2avpils Water and Wastewater Treatment&#13;
2.21          Development of Ziemelu Wellfield. The Ziemelu wellfield has been investigated over&#13;
many years and numerous test boreholes have shown it to be a potential high quality water source.&#13;
The pipeline between Daugavpils and the site was started prior to Latvia's re-independence but&#13;
construction was stopped due to a lack of funds. The present project would allow for completion of&#13;
the pipeline, development of the wellfield to a capacity of 13,000 cubic meters per day, and&#13;
construction of facilities for iron removal. This would, in combination with rehabilitation of the&#13;
existing groundwater wellfield at Vingri with a capacity of 12,000 cubic meters per day, allow the&#13;
city to substantially reduce its dependence on surface water. The resulting diversification of raw&#13;
water sources would enable the utility to provide a minimal level of service during any future water&#13;
emergencies. In addition, it provides a base for future development of groundwater resources at&#13;
Ziemelu which will enable a complete transition away from surface water in the medium term.&#13;
2.22          In order to facilitate future groundwater resource development, fixed infrastructure at&#13;
the site is being developed in such a way as to allow a staged transition to full capacity. Parallel&#13;
development of the wellfield and iron removal facilities is necessary to ensure community support for&#13;
tariff increases necessary to restore the financial viability of the utility. In addition to increased water&#13;
safety and water quality, development of groundwater resources would result in lower operating costs&#13;
due to savings on water treatment chemicals.&#13;
2.23          Rehabilitation of the Existing Wastewater Treatment Plant.  The existing wastewater&#13;
treatment plant provides for primary treatment only. Rehabilitation of the existing mechanical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
treatment works and addition of a biological phase would allow for significant reduction in levels of&#13;
biological oxygen demand (BOD) and suspended solids to compliance with EU standards.2&#13;
2.24          Rehabilitation of Pumping Stations. All of the flow to the sewage treatment works is&#13;
pumped, and over 90% of the sewage delivered at the treatment works is pumped by the Kandavas&#13;
pumping station. The two pumps at Kandavas were installed in 1963, and one of the pumps cannot&#13;
run for longer than two weeks at a time. Although there is relatively little problem with overflow at&#13;
present, there are concerns about the reliability of the pumps at Kandavas and at the satellite pumping&#13;
stations.&#13;
2.25          Metering. Although industrial customers are metered, most household and&#13;
institutional customers are not. Water consumption is calculated based on normatives which&#13;
significantly underestimate actual consumption (220 liters per person per day billed as compared to&#13;
280 liters per person per day consumed). This is true even though leakage in Daugavpils is a&#13;
relatively minor problem given the relative newness of most of the distribution network and limited&#13;
length of the distribution system relative to population. Under the project, funding has been included&#13;
for installation of meters in each of 200 apartment (block) buildings to allow for billing of actual&#13;
consumption. The project would also include financing for installation of bulk meters in the network&#13;
to monitor system performance and assist in leakage detection.&#13;
2.26          Monitoring. The project includes financing for laboratory equipment needed to&#13;
support monitoring of water and wastewater. The project also includes financing for installation of a&#13;
set of monitoring wells in the vicinity of the proposed Ziemelu wellfield to monitor water quality and&#13;
to monitor impact of pumping on direction of known contaminant plumes.&#13;
2.27          Institutional Strengthening and Twinning. The project includes funding for a twinning&#13;
arrangement which would include consultancy and advisory services aimed at assisting the enterprise&#13;
in shifting financial and operations management practices towards a more market-oriented and&#13;
commercial basis appropriate to an independent utility. The Finnish government has agreed to fund&#13;
this on a grant basis, and an agreement has been reached with the water utility of Tampere, Finland.&#13;
2.28          Technical Assistance for Project Management. Previous projects in Latvia have&#13;
shown the need for targeted technical assistance to assist the beneficiary in project management and&#13;
implementation including procurement, disbursement and construction supervision as well as&#13;
assistance in implementation of financial and operational changes required under the project.&#13;
Technical assistance is included to support the DMEU in these areas. Technical assistance is also&#13;
included to support development of detailed design for project implementation.&#13;
Municipal Development Fund&#13;
2.29          A Municipal Development Fund would be established on a pilot basis to finance&#13;
similar municipal infrastructure investments on a smaller scale in a number of communities&#13;
2Given space constraints on the existing site, the volume of retention tanks is limited. Discharge&#13;
standards have been estimated using these parameters and can meet HELCOM standards with the retention time&#13;
possible under these conditions. Movement to an entirely new site with no such space constraints is not&#13;
financially possible nor economically justified.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
throughout Latvia. If successful, the MDF would provide a mechanism for channeling funds to local&#13;
governments at all levels for small and medium sized projects and would obviate the need for separate&#13;
preparation and appraisal by lending institutions of each individual project.&#13;
2.30          The MDF was established by decree of the Cabinet of Ministers on November 10,&#13;
1995. [para 6.2(a)] The MDF will be administered by the Public Investment Programll (PIP) unit in&#13;
the Ministry of Economy under the supervision of an inter-minlisterial Board of Directors. The Boardl&#13;
includes representatives of the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Environinenral&#13;
Protection and Regional Development and the Union of Local Gove arments. Representatives from&#13;
other sectoral Ministries will be invited to participate in the evaluation of projects in those sectors.&#13;
2.31          Project proposals would be developed and submitted by the municipality and&#13;
would be evaluated on the basis of criteria and procedures agreed with the Bank. (See attached&#13;
Annex B). [para 6. 1(b)]. Only investment projects will be financed. Areas eligible for financing&#13;
include water supply, wastewater collection and treatment, solid waste collection and disposal,&#13;
transport, district heating, construction of schools and medical facilities. Projects will be selected on&#13;
a demand driven basis and are not pre-identified. To be accepted, project proposals must be in the&#13;
sectors outlined above, must meet rate of return targets and financial covenants, show adequate&#13;
arrangements for project management and implementation and must present technical studies&#13;
demonstrating project feasibility and selection of least cost alternative.&#13;
Institutional Development Component&#13;
2.32          The Project will provide for technical assistance to the Borrower as required for&#13;
implementation of the MDF and for the Project Coordination Unit. This component also includes&#13;
financing for purchase of related equipment needed for the establishment of these units.&#13;
F. Cost Estimates&#13;
2.33          The total cost of the project is estimated to be US$45.4 million (Ls. 22.7 million&#13;
equivalent) including price and physical contingencies; US$33.9 million or 75% are foreign costs and&#13;
US$11.5 million or 25% are local. Price contingencies are based on local inflation rates of 15% in&#13;
1996, 10% in 1997 and 6% thereafter. International inflation is estimated at 2.6%. Physical&#13;
contingencies were estimated at 10% for project components involving construction and civil works.&#13;
No contingencies have been calculated on the MDF component as the sum allocated is a flat amount.&#13;
Total contingencies represent US$4.9 million or 11% of total project costs. (Contingencies represent&#13;
US$4.1 million or 18% of the costs of the Daugavpils component). Project cost estimates do not&#13;
include taxes. Amounts to be expended on VAT are not included in the project cost estimates, nor on&#13;
the following table. It is expected that VAT will be levied on local costs and will amount to an&#13;
additional US$1.7 million.&#13;

G. Project Financing Arrangements&#13;
2.34             The proposed Bank loan of US$27.3 million would finance approximately 60%  of&#13;
total project costs. The loan would finance US$23.0 million of foreign costs (68% of total foreign&#13;
costs net of taxes) and US$4.3 million of local costs (37% of total local costs net of taxes). The&#13;
Bank loan would be repaid over a seventeen year period including four years of grace at the Bank's&#13;
standard variable interest rate and standard commitment fees. Cofinancing in the amount of US$11.0&#13;
million has been confirmed for the Daugavpils component. A summary of the proposed financing&#13;
arrangements can be found in Table 2.2.&#13;
2.35             It was agreed that the Ministry of Finance would on-lend funds for the Daugavpils&#13;
water and wastewater component to the DMEU with a municipal guarantee of repayment. The&#13;
Ministry of Finance will on-lend funds for the Riga urban transport project to the City of Riga&#13;
directly for use by the three transport companies. The City of Riga will lend the proceeds to the&#13;
companies. Proceeds of the MDF would be on-lent at roughly the same terms and conditions as these&#13;
funds are provided to the Governmient of Latvia. It has been agreed that the interest rate mark-up&#13;
would be a minimum of 10% of the Bank interest rate and a maximum of 30% of the Bank interest&#13;
rate. Execution of subsidiary loan agreements with Riga and DMEU and the City of Daugavpils&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
would be required as conditions of effectiveness. [paras 6.3 (a) and (b)] The Ministry of Finance&#13;
would on-lend funds directly to beneficiaries of the MDF. Terms and conditions for sub-loans as&#13;
well as more details on individual financing packages for the various sub-projects are described&#13;
below.&#13;

2.36           Riga Urban Transport. The foreign component of the Riga Urban Transport sub-&#13;
project costs is relatively high at 97% given the emphasis on purchase of imported equipment and&#13;
extremely limited civil works. The municipality would be required to contribute 10% of total project&#13;
costs or US$1.9 million towards the project costs of which US$1.3 million would be foreign exchange&#13;
costs.&#13;
2.37           Daugavpils Water and Wastewater. The Bank loan would finance US$6.9 million or&#13;
approximately 31 % of total sub-project cost. NEFCO would provide a loan of US$2 million&#13;
equivalent (9% of total sub-project costs) for fifteen years at an interest rate of 0.5% over NEFCO's&#13;
cost of borrowing.&#13;
2.38           Donors involved in the Baltic Sea program have made commitments for grant&#13;
financing of US$9.0 million or 40% of the Daugavpils water and wastewater component of the&#13;
proposed project. The Swedish International Development Agency (US$3.0 million) and the Danish&#13;
Environmental Protection Agency (US$2.2 million) have committed joint financing of foreign&#13;
expenditures associated with the rehabilitation of the wastewater treatment plant and rehabilitation of&#13;
the pumping stations and gravity sewers subject to the approval of their respective governments. EU&#13;
PHARE has committed US$2.6 million which can be used for financing of the wastewater component&#13;
of the project. The Finnish government has committed to financing the twinning arrangement&#13;
(US$1.2 million). A condition for disbursement of the Daugavpils component would be that all&#13;
conditions be met for NEFCO co-financing and for grant financing by the Governments of&#13;
Sweden, Denmark, Finland and EU PHARE. [para 6.4(a)]&#13;
2.39           The Government of Latvia has committed US$2.0 million through the Public&#13;
Investment Program towards rehabilitation of the Daugavpils wastewater collection and treatment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
systems. This financing would be on a grant basis and would be used to finance local costs. This&#13;
represents approximately 10% of total sub-project costs.&#13;
2.40         The municipality would contribute US$1.8 million and the water and wastewater&#13;
company US$0.5 million towards project costs met. Daugavpils' contribution to the financing&#13;
package has been set so that: (i) donor requirements regarding financing of the wastewater&#13;
component are satisfied; (ii) a minimum of 10% of total component costs are covered by the&#13;
municipality; (iii) total local counterpart financing (state and local) for the component is a minimum&#13;
of 20%; and (iv) total debt does not exceed estimated capacity for repayment.&#13;
2.41         Municipal Development Fund. Financing for the MDF is relatively modest as it is&#13;
intended to be a pilot, but should be sufficient for several moderate size projects. Total Bank&#13;
financing is US$3.5 million. Total local financing is estimated based on a maximum MDF&#13;
contribution of 20% towards sub-project costs. The selection of the first three projects and any&#13;
projects over US$500,000 will be subject to the agreement of the Bank.&#13;
2.42         Institutional Development Component. The project includes technical assistance for&#13;
consultant services and for equipment needed to assist the MDF and Project Coordination Unit&#13;
(PCU). US$100,000 of the loan proceeds has been allocated to the PCU and US$100,000 has been&#13;
allocated to the MDF. Repayment of these funds would be covered out of the interest rate mark-up&#13;
proposed by the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
H. Procurement&#13;
2.43         Procurement for Bank financed components would be governed by World Bank&#13;
Procurement Guidelines of January 1995 and would make use of the Bank's standard bidding&#13;
documents. Procurement arrangements are summarized in Table 2.3 and details of the procurement&#13;
plan are located in Annex C. The general procurement notice will be issued on November 30, 1995.&#13;
A procurement workshop was conducted during the appraisal and a project launch workshop will be&#13;
conducted in February 1996. A Country Procurement Review Paper has been prepared.&#13;
2.44         Responsibility for Procurement. Procurement will be coordinated by the PCU in the&#13;
Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development (MOERD) which will be assisted by&#13;
procurement consultants, located in the Ministry of Finance, experienced in Bank procurement&#13;
procedures.&#13;
2.45         Procurement Procedures. For World Bank financed components the following&#13;
procedures are proposed.&#13;
(a)   International Competitive Bidding (ICB) will apply to all contracts for goods,&#13;
equipment and civil works greater than US$300,000. For the three major project&#13;
components it is expected that there will be 9 ICB contracts of which 7 are for goods,&#13;
1 for civil works and 1 supply and install. Total value of ICB contracts is expected to&#13;
be US$22.6 million for the two pre-identified sub-projects. Prequalification of&#13;
bidders will be required for the one supply and install contract and for the thyristor&#13;
chopper traction control systems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
(b)    National Competitive Bidding (NCB) will apply to civil works contracts greater than&#13;
US$50,000 and less than US$300,000. Bank sample bidding documents will be used.&#13;
Contracts involving NCB are expected to amount to US$3.4 million.&#13;
(c)    International Shopping (IS) will apply to contracts for equipment valued at less than&#13;
US$300,000 except as provided for below under local shopping. Contracts for IS will&#13;
be awarded on the basis of quotations to be obtained from a minimum of 3 suppliers&#13;
from at least 2 countries. This is expected to apply to contracts totalling US$2.0&#13;
million in the aggregate.&#13;
(d)    National Shopping (NS) will be used for items or groups of items costing less than&#13;
US$50,000 up to an aggregate of US$120,000. Award of contracts will be based on&#13;
at least 3 quotations obtained from three different eligible suppliers.&#13;
(e)    Consultant Services required under the project are expected to require US$1.8 million.&#13;
Consultant services would be procured in accordance with Bank Guidelines on the Use&#13;
of Consultants. Consultants would be shortlisted and selected on a competitive basis&#13;
with the exception of US$160,000 in short-term individual consultant services for the&#13;
MDF and PCU.&#13;
(f)    Direct Contracting will apply to purchase of some spare parts for the Riga urban&#13;
transport component of the project which have been identified as unique to trams,&#13;
trolleybuses and buses now in use and where substitution is not possible or where&#13;
compatibility of equipment cannot be demonstrated. Contracts involving direct&#13;
contracting are expected to amount to US$1.2 million.&#13;
2.46          In accordance with Bank procurement procedures, a preference for domestic&#13;
manufactured goods will be allowed equal to the applicable tariff for the nonexempt importer or 15%&#13;
of the CIF price of the imported goods offered by the competing bidders, whichever is lower. This&#13;
applies only to ICB contracts for goods.&#13;
2.47          Investments financed on a parallel basis by the Danish Government, the Swedish&#13;
Government, the Finnish Government, EU PHARE and NEFCO would be subject to the individual&#13;
procurement practices of those countries and organizations. In the case of the donors, most financing&#13;
is tied. Local counterpart financing from state and local governments would be subject to the&#13;
procurement requirements of the World Bank except where it is being applied towards a sub-&#13;
component of the project subject being financed by a donor or co-financier with distinct procurement&#13;
requirements which would govern that particular contract.&#13;
2.48          Prior Bank review will be required for all civil works and goods contracts over&#13;
US$300,000. Prior Bank review will be required for the first three NCB contracts for civil works.&#13;
Prior Bank review will be required for all consultant contracts greater than US$100,000 for firms and&#13;
above $50,000 in the case of individual consultants. However, regardless of value, all consultant&#13;
terms of reference will be subject to prior Bank review. Any contract awarded after direct&#13;
negotiations with suppliers would also be subject to Bank prior review. Prior review is expected to&#13;
cover US$44.8 million or 98% of the amount financed by the Bank and associated local counterpart&#13;
financing.&#13;

2.49          Procurement Monitoring and Reporting. Procurement data would be collected and&#13;
recorded by the PCU for: (a) prompt reporting of contract award information by the Borrower; (b)&#13;
comprehensive semi-annual reports to the Bank by the Borrower; and (c) revised timing of&#13;
procurement actions, including advertising, bidding, contract award, and completion time for&#13;
individual contracts. A computerized procurement management system would be installed by the&#13;
PCU.&#13;
I. Disbursement&#13;
2.50          It is expected that the loan will disburse starting in calendar year 1996 and finish in&#13;
year 2000. No standard disbursement profiles exist for municipal projects in Latvia or in the region.&#13;
The disbursement schedule for the Bank loan has been calculated separately for each component and&#13;
together in Table 2.4. Disbursement against specific categories is noted in Table 2.5. The Riga&#13;
urban transport component of the project is expected to disburse relatively quickly given the nature of&#13;
the project. Construction works for the Daugavpils component are not expected to commence until&#13;
the spring of 1997 and are estimated to require only two full construction seasons to complete given&#13;
the relatively modest nature of the works. The government has requested a Project Preparation&#13;
Facility (PPF) in the amount of US$510,000 to allow for initiation of detailed designs related to the&#13;
Daugavpils component and to allow for establishment of the PMUs.&#13;
2.51          Disbursement will be the responsibility of the Ministry of Finance. However, the&#13;
PMUs will be responsible for preparing and maintaining all documentation. Disbursement training&#13;
will be organized for staff in the PMUs and the Ministry of Finance.&#13;
2.52          To facilitate project implementation, the Borrower would establish a Special Account&#13;
in a major commercial bank, on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank, to cover the Bank's&#13;
share of expenditures. The authorized allocation would be US$500,000, representing about four&#13;
months of average expenditures made through the Special Account. During the early stage of the&#13;
project, the initial allocation to the Special Account would be limited to US$250,000. However,&#13;
when the aggregate disbursements under the Loan have reached the level of US$2,000,000, the initial&#13;
allocation may be increased up to US$500,000 by submitting the relevant application for withdrawal.&#13;
Applications for replenishment of the Special Account would be submitted monthly or when one third&#13;
of the amount has been withdrawn, whichever occurs earlier. Documentation requirements for&#13;
replenishment would follow the standard Bank procedure as described in the Disbursement Handbook,&#13;
Chapter 6. Monthly bank statements of the Special Account, which have been reconciled by the&#13;
Borrower, would accompany all replenishment requests.&#13;

2.53             Statements of expenditure would be used on goods and civil works contracts valued at&#13;
less than US$300,000. Statements of expenditure would be used on consultant contracts less than&#13;
US$50,000 for individuals and at less than US$100,000 for firms. Each PMU would be responsible&#13;
for retaining all supporting documentation and must be able to present this on request for inspection&#13;
by the Bank, the Ministry of Finance and external auditors. Full documentation would be required&#13;
for expenditures on contracts for goods and works above US$300,000 and for services above&#13;
US$100,000 (firms) and US$50,000 (individuals). The minimum size of the application for Direct&#13;
Payment and issuance of the Special Commitment would amount to 20%  of the authorized allocation&#13;
to the Special Account.&#13;

J. Accounts and Audit&#13;
2.54             For each of the sub-projects, separate project accounts would be required to be&#13;
maintained according to accepted international accounting standards. The purpose of separate project&#13;
accounts is to ensure that the flow of funds flows associated with the project can be identified and&#13;
tracked. These project accounts would be subject to annual audit along with the special accounts, as&#13;
described above. Audit would be undertaken by qualified independent auditors acceptable to the Bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
and in accordance with international accounting and auditing procedures. The MDF would also be&#13;
audited on an annual basis by qualified independent auditors acceptable to the Bank. Annual audits&#13;
for the two major sub-projects and for the MDF would be presented to the Bank no later than 6&#13;
months following the completion of the fiscal year. Audits of MDF sub-projects should be submitted&#13;
to the MDF no later than 4 months following the completion of the fiscal year.&#13;
K. Environmental Aspects&#13;
2.55         Preparation of the project has included environmental studies and reviews as required&#13;
under the Bank Operational Directive 4.01, "Environmental Assessment," and as required by Latvian&#13;
Law.&#13;
2.56         Daugavpils Water and Wastewater. This component involves improved water supply&#13;
for Latvia's second largest city and rehabilitation of the existing wastewater treatment plant in&#13;
Daugavpils. Both will have a beneficial environmental effect by: (i) providing safer supplies of&#13;
drinking water thus enhancing public health; and (ii) by reducing discharges of untreated and partially&#13;
treated wastewater to the Daugavpils River which will contribute to improved conditions in the Riga&#13;
Bay and Baltic Sea. An environmental review has been prepared in accordance with the requirements&#13;
for a "B" project which assesses the impact of discharge from the wastewater treatment plant and&#13;
which has been used to support the design of the component. The study also reviews previous&#13;
investigations of water quality at the proposed wellfield development and evaluates potential risk&#13;
factors. The findings of these reports are summarized and incorporated into the report in the&#13;
Environmental Review (Annex D). By January 31, 1996, DMEU will present a plan acceptable to&#13;
the Bank for addressing all issues highlighted in the Environmental Review: (i) establishment of&#13;
a groundwater monitoring program for the Ziemelu wellfield; (ii) improvement in sludge&#13;
management; (iii) establishment of a monitoring program for effluent from the wastewater&#13;
treatment plant and downstream river water quality; and (iv) remediation of the former Krizi&#13;
landfill to protect against any threat to the future quality of groundwater. A general condition&#13;
of the Daugavpils Project Agreement is that DMEU take all measures necessary to comply with&#13;
the agreed monitoring plan. [para 6. 1(c)]&#13;
2.57         Riga Urban Transport. This component has been prepared, as have other urban&#13;
transport projects in the Region, consistent with a "B" rating. An environmental study has been&#13;
completed with Dutch assistance (Annex E). This component is expected to have a positive impact on&#13;
the environment by reducing air pollution and energy consumption. Buses purchased under the&#13;
project will be required to meet higher emissions standards than the very old buses being withdrawn&#13;
from service, thus reducing the level of air pollution. The City of Riga already undertakes an&#13;
extensive program of emissions monitoring for buses and requires use of fuel meeting European&#13;
standards. Continuation of this program will be required as a general condition under the Riga&#13;
Project Agreement. [para 6. l(d)]. The sub-project, through introduction of improved maintenance&#13;
practices, will increase energy efficiency of the buses and reduce harmful emissions. Improvements&#13;
to trolleybuses and to tram traction systems will reduce energy consumption. Finally, the project is&#13;
designed to make public transport more attractive, thus reducing the rapid trend towards the use of&#13;
private cars and taxis. This would result in significant energy savings and reduced air pollution.&#13;
2.58         Municipal Development Fund Sub-projects would be required to meet both the&#13;
requirement of the Latvian Law on "State Environmental Impact Assessments" and Bank Operational&#13;
Directive 4.01.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

L. Participatory Approach&#13;
2.59         The preparation of the project has been carried out in close cooperation with the&#13;
Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development, the City of Riga, the Riga public&#13;
transport companies, the City of Daugavpils, the Daugavpils Municipal Enterprise Udensvads, the&#13;
Public Investment Program unit and the Ministry of Finance. Preparation of the Daugavpils Water&#13;
and Wastewater sub-project was carried out under the supervision of a steering group including&#13;
representatives of the Latvian authorities, the Swedish International Development Agency, the Danish&#13;
Environmental Protection Agency, the Finnish Ministry of Environment, EU PHARE, NEFCO and&#13;
the World Bank. Preparation of the Municipal Development Fund sub-project has been supervised by&#13;
a steering group including representatives of the Latvian Union of Local Governments.&#13;

III. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. Organization and Management&#13;
3.1          Project Implementation Responsibilities. Primary responsibility for project&#13;
implementation would be decentralized to local authorities. This is consistent with one of the main&#13;
project objectives - namely to help strengthen management capacity at the local government level for&#13;
key municipal services. An individual Project Management Unit or PMU has been established for&#13;
each of the subprojects. These units are responsible for preparation of designs, specifications,&#13;
construction supervision, institutional strengthening, implementation of policy reforms required under&#13;
the project, project reporting and project accounts. A Project Coordination Unit (PCU) has been&#13;
established under the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development to oversee&#13;
implementation and to coordinate procurement and reporting. Technical assistance needed for project&#13;
implementation is included in the project cost estimates.&#13;
(a)    Riga Urban Transport. Project management responsibilities would be assigned to the&#13;
Public Transport Unit (PTU) which has been created through addition of staff with&#13;
requisite financial, economic, procurement and legal skills to the RBMST. The City&#13;
of Riga shall maintain the PTU with functions and responsibilities acceptable to&#13;
the Bank and with staff in adequate numbers, with qualifications, experience and&#13;
terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank. [para 6.1(e)]. The PTU would be&#13;
assisted by international consultants financed under the project.&#13;
(b)    Daugavpils Water and Wastewater. A PMU has been established in the Daugavpils&#13;
Municipal Enterprise Udensvads (DMEU). During execution of the project, DMEU&#13;
shall maintain the PMU with functions and responsibilities acceptable to the Bank&#13;
and with staff, in adequate numbers, with qualifications, experience and terms of&#13;
reference satisfactory to the Bank. [para 6.1(f)]. The PMU would be assisted by&#13;
international consultants financed under the project and would also benefit from a&#13;
twinning arrangement being set up with grant financing from the Finnish Government.&#13;
(c)    Municipal Development Fund. The MDF has been established by decree of the&#13;
Cabinet of Ministers. The Public Investment Program (PIP) unit of the Ministry of&#13;
Economy would administer the MDF under the supervision of a Board of Directors&#13;
consisting of representatives of the Ministries of Economy, Finance, Environment and&#13;
Regional Development, and the Union of Local Governments. Additional staff with&#13;
experience in civil engineering and project finance would be required to enable the&#13;
PIP unit to discharge these responsibilities and these costs would be covered through&#13;
an administrative mark-up on the on-lending rate. Actual implementation of&#13;
investment projects financed by the MDF would be the responsibility of the respective&#13;
local governments and their associated municipal enterprises or departments which&#13;
would appoint a project coordinator.&#13;
(d)    Project Coordination Unit (PCU). A Project Coordination Unit (PCU) has been&#13;
established under the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development&#13;
to monitor project implementation, coordinate procurement and to track progress of&#13;
disbursement and compliance with project conditionality. The unit consisting of at&#13;
least two experienced staff with civil engineering and financial backgrounds would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
also be responsible for maintaining relations with the World Bank and donors and&#13;
assisting in project monitoring and supervision. During the execution of the&#13;
Project, the Borrower shall maintain the PCU with functions and responsibilities&#13;
acceptable to the Bank and with staff in adequate numbers with qualifications,&#13;
experience and terms of reference satisfactory to the Bank. [para 6. 1(g)].&#13;
3.2          Implementation Schedule. The proposed project would be implemented over a five&#13;
year period with an additional six months for the payment of financial obligations committed prior to&#13;
the project completion date and full withdrawal of Loan proceeds. The project is expected to be&#13;
completed by December 31, 2000, and the Loan closed on June 30, 2001. The PCU would submit&#13;
an Implementation Completion Report (ICR) to the Bank within six months of the closing date.&#13;
B. Project Reporting&#13;
3.3          A Project Implementation Plan has been developed including key project milestones&#13;
and timetables (Annex C). These would be monitored by the PCU with the assistance of staff in the&#13;
Daugavpils PMU, Riga PTU and in the MDF. The PCU would be responsible for submitting semi-&#13;
annual reports on project performance to the World Bank in collaboration with PMU, PTU and MDF&#13;
staff. The PCU would also be responsible for submitting similar semi-annual reports on project&#13;
performance to other donors and co-financiers. A mid-term review by the Bank would take place&#13;
no later than September 30, 1998. [para 6. 1(h)].&#13;
C. Project Supervision&#13;
3.4          In addition to review of procurement actions, audits and semi-annual reports on&#13;
project progress, the Bank will conduct regular supervision missions. It is also likely that donors and&#13;
co-financiers will participate in these supervision missions. A supervision plan has been elaborated in&#13;
the Project Implementation Plan. Given that two cities are involved in the project and both are&#13;
inexperienced with project management and procurement, at least 22 staff weeks per year will be&#13;
required for project supervision during the first two years of implementation.&#13;
&#13;

IV. FINANCIAL AND OPERATIONAL ASPECTS&#13;
A. General Principles&#13;
4.1            Central issues in the development of municipal services in Latvia are movement&#13;
towards cost recovery and reinforcement of the legal autonomy and budgetary independence of&#13;
municipal enterprises through formalization of contractual relationships and strengthening of&#13;
institutional structures. Introduction of measures to improve the financial status has been required&#13;
under the project. The present status of these efforts and future actions necessary are described in&#13;
more detail below for the Riga Urban Transport and Daugavpils Water and Wastewater components.&#13;
B. Past Financial Performance&#13;
4.2            User charges for municipal services are determined by the municipality for both&#13;
municipal enterprises and for municipal departments. Although local governments in Latvia have&#13;
already made substantial progress towards cost recovery, user charges in most cases still fall below&#13;
full cost recovery levels including depreciation and maintenance. At current levels, user charges do&#13;
not allow service providers to function on a commercially viable basis and to maintain appropriate&#13;
debt service coverage ratios. Special characteristics involving the identified components are detailed&#13;
below.&#13;
4.3            Riga Urban Transport. The 1994 operating performance of the three Riga municipal&#13;
transport companies is summarized in Table 4.1 below.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
4.4           In Riga, public transport is subsidized though not to the same degree as in other&#13;
transition economies. The ratio of ticket revenue to total expenditures amounts to 56% (Imanta);&#13;
67% (Talava); and 72% (Tram and Trolleybus Park). The deficit for each of the three Riga&#13;
municipal transport companies is covered in part by transfers or subsidies from the municipal budget&#13;
amounting to a total of Ls. 3.0 million for 1994 for the three companies. Ticket revenue plus&#13;
transfers are sufficient to cover basic cash outflows; however, they do not cover depreciation and&#13;
amortization. This amounted to Ls. 1.0 million for 1994 or approximately 9% of total expenditures&#13;
for all three municipal public transport companies. This represents depreciation on historic book&#13;
value only, not actual replacement costs. As a result, the public transport companies have not been&#13;
able to purchase new replacement vehicles or to maintain sufficient spares inventories as required for&#13;
normal maintenance and periodic refurbishment of equipment.&#13;
4.5           The under funding of the transport companies has persisted since re-independence and&#13;
the state of the fleet has continued to deteriorate. The situation is particularly critical with respect to&#13;
the two bus companies where the average age of buses is 7.7 years (Talava) and 9.5 years (Imanta) as&#13;
compared to an expected useful life of 10 years for an Ikarus bus. The average age of trolleybuses is&#13;
approximately 10 years, slightly less than the useful life of the Skoda vehicles. (To enable efficient&#13;
operation, the average age of the fleet should be equal to half of the useful life of the vehicle - 5&#13;
years in this case). The situation is less severe with respect to trams as these have useful lives of 20&#13;
years, so lack of new investment over the last five years has had a much less serious impact. Without&#13;
sufficient cash flow to begin retirement and replacement of aged vehicles, public transport services in&#13;
Riga will be severely compromised. Vehicle operating costs will increase and reliability decrease as&#13;
vehicle breakdowns become increasingly frequent.&#13;
4.6           There are a number of factors contributing to the poor financial condition of the&#13;
enterprises. First, tariff levels established by the municipality are not sufficient to cover depreciation&#13;
even though they do achieve basic operating cost recovery. Second, operators are not directly&#13;
compensated for carrying passengers at concessionary or reduced fares. Such passengers account for&#13;
30% to 40% of all trips and it is estimated that the cost to the municipal public transport enterprises&#13;
amounts to Ls. 1.6 million annually, assuming a 0.5 price elasticity of demand. Third, fare evasion&#13;
is estimated at 10% and is estimated to cost operators Ls. 0.8 million. Fourth, operating costs are&#13;
high due to the age of the vehicle fleet, frequent breakdowns, lack of spare parts, and high employee&#13;
turnover due to perversely defined incentive programs.&#13;
4.7           Daugavpils Water and Wastewater. Table 4.2 below provides a summary of the&#13;
operating performance of DMEU for the last two years.&#13;
4.8           The financial condition of DMEU is poor. User charges are sufficient to cover the&#13;
basic cash outflows without any transfers from the municipal budget. However, they do not cover the&#13;
full costs of operation and some wastewater treatment processes have been discontinued due to lack of&#13;
funds for purchase of chemicals and repair of equipment. Even after economizing on operations,&#13;
uncovered costs represent 16% of total expenditures. The significant accumulation of arrears by&#13;
industrial customers has further strained the cash flow of the enterprise and the absence of any&#13;
allowance for bad debt expense distorts the validity of reported accounting income (losses). Estimated&#13;
annual losses of Ls. 100,000 and increases in accounts receivable are covered by accumulation of tax&#13;
arrears and depreciation.&#13;

/b Fixed assets were revalued ten fold on 1/1/93.&#13;
4.8           In its present financial condition, DMEU is unable to provide for appropriate&#13;
maintenance of the system and cannot accumulate the funds necessary for replacement of urgently&#13;
needed equipment. Nor is it in a position to cover debt service, improved maintenance and increased&#13;
chemical costs needed to properly treat wastewater without increases in user charges and improvement&#13;
in collections.&#13;
4.9           Due to the general negative economic environment, the city has witnessed a decline in&#13;
local industrial output through closures and operations at low capacity, and a net outward migration of&#13;
the population. This has led to shrinkages in water demand. Over the last two years, billed water&#13;
sales went down by 12% (10%  in 1994) for domestic consumers; 32% (13% in 1994) for non-&#13;
domestic consumers; and 19 % (I I% in 1994) for all consumer categories. Combined average tariff&#13;
per m3 of water sold increased by 51 % in 1994, slightly below the 55 % increase in operating costs.&#13;
A faster decline in non-domestic consumption is accentuated in terms of overall revenue as the&#13;
domestic consumer is subsidized through cross subsidies. Non-domestic water consumption, as a&#13;
percentage of total consumption, has declined from 31% in 1992 to 26% in 1994. Thus fixed costs&#13;
have to be recovered from a declining sales base.&#13;
C. Tariff Levels, Subsidies and Transfers&#13;
4.10          Riga Urban Transport. Ticketing for the three municipal public transport companies&#13;
is unified and a single fare is established by the City Council. Although there was previously a zone&#13;
system in effect, this was eliminated in July 1994 by the newly elected city administration. At&#13;
present, a single fare of 8 santimes is charged for all distances. This fare was introduced in March&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
1995 and represents a one-third increase over the previous fare or roughly equivalent to the rate of&#13;
inflation. Further increases are being discussed in case of a rise in electricity charges.&#13;
4.11           The price of a monthly pass valid for 7 days per week is Ls. 3.50 for an adult. This&#13;
amounts to only 35 % of the estimated price of an equivalent number of single tickets (Ls. 10 per&#13;
month). The estimated discount is 65 %. Such monthly ticket sales amount to 43 % of total revenues&#13;
and cover more than 70% of total passenger rides. An approach to the rationalization of&#13;
concessionary fares was agreed with the municipality during the appraisal and will be implemented&#13;
upon completion of the transport model now under preparation.&#13;
4.12           Monthly ticket prices are further discounted for a number of classes of passengers.&#13;
Schoolchildren pay only 22% of the cost of an adult pass. Pensioners pay only 39% of the cost of an&#13;
adult pass and pensioners over seventy years of age pay only 19%. Former political prisoners and&#13;
children under seven travel for free. Concessionary fares for schoolchildren, small children and&#13;
former political prisoners are required under state law. Concessionary fares for pensioners are not a&#13;
state requirement and have been adopted independently by the municipality. As noted above, the&#13;
public transport enterprises are not compensated for carrying passengers at reduced fares. The total&#13;
cost of the concessionary fares program is estimated to be Ls. 1.6 million. The municipality&#13;
compensates the municipal public transport enterprises for uncovered losses excluding depreciation.&#13;
This subsidy amounted to Ls. 3 million for 1994 or Ls. 1.4 million in net subsidy over and above the&#13;
level required to cover concessionary fares. This represents a subsidy level of approximately 15%&#13;
which is considered to be justifiable considering the positive externalities associated with public&#13;
transport including reduced congestion and decreased expenditure on roads and road maintenance.&#13;
This compares favorably with other countries in the Region such as Russia where a reduction in&#13;
subsidies to 50% of cost recovery fares is targeted.&#13;

4.13          Daugavpils Water and Wastewater. In accordance with agreements reached with the&#13;
City of Daugavpils and DMEU, tariffs for household and institutional customers were increased on&#13;
October 1, 1995, by approximately 80% to 12.5 santimes per m3 for water and wastewater services.&#13;
Industrial customers continue to pay 9 santimes for water and 6.6 santimes for wastewater for a&#13;
combined charge of 15.6 santimes per m3. This was the first increase since June 1, 1994, and will be&#13;
sufficient to cover current operating costs including payment of taxes and provision for maintenance.&#13;
This should improve the financial status of DMEU considerably and allow for resumption of various&#13;
treatment processes which were discontinued due to lack of funds.&#13;
D. Ticketing, Billing and Collection&#13;
4.14          Riga Urban Transport. Bus and tram tickets are sold mostly through third parties&#13;
such as news agents' kiosks and post offices, and by bus and tram drivers. Monthly concessionary&#13;
tickets are sold at TTP head office, and in addition, at post offices for pensioners. Sales commissions&#13;
of up to 5% are paid to third parties, whereas drivers get 10% commission, paid with their salaries.&#13;
Tickets are distributed by TTP and all cash collected, except for sales by drivers, is handled by TTP.&#13;
Ticket revenue is allocated amongst the three companies on the basis of seat/kilometers operated by&#13;
each company, irrespective of actual passengers carried. Based on seat/kilometers reported by each&#13;
company every month, TTP distributes the revenue and transfers the cash due, net of commissions, to&#13;
Imanta and Talava. TTP makes a monthly advance payment by the tenth day, and final settlement by&#13;
the twenty fifth day of the following month. Talava's Inter-city bus ticket sales are controlled by it&#13;
directly.&#13;
4.15          The present system of ticket revenue distribution is inequitable and leads to inefficient&#13;
practices. Revenue is determined by numbers of seats and distances travelled, with no regard to&#13;
numbers of passengers carried. The transport companies operate as many seat/kilometers as they can&#13;
without direct reference to customer demand.&#13;
4.16          As agreed with the city council, service contracts between the city council and the&#13;
transport companies, as required under this project and referred to below, will provide for new&#13;
revenue collection and distribution procedures. The city council, through its Public Transport Unit&#13;
(PTU), will be responsible for ticket revenue collection, including the issue of tickets and passes.&#13;
Any revenue collected by the transport companies will be handed over to PTU on the day of&#13;
collection. Ticket revenue will be distributed on the basis of number of passengers and distance&#13;
carried (passenger/kilometers). Transport operators will be permitted under the contract to operate an&#13;
incentive scheme to reward management and staff for good performance. The terms of the scheme&#13;
and the payments will be subject to the approval of the city council.&#13;
4.17          Daugavpils Water and Wastewater. Two different computerized billing systems&#13;
operate for metered and non metered consumers. About 94% of domestic consumers (38,000 in total)&#13;
are not metered, whereas the majority of non domestic consumers (800 in total) are metered. Non&#13;
metered consumers are billed on the basis of notional consumption according to set standard&#13;
consumption rates per person or business. Non metered consumers are not issued with monthly bills&#13;
as these are fixed. The consumer is notified of any changes which may occur, such as increase in&#13;
tariff, change in numbers in the household. All communication, such as notification of revised bills,&#13;
reminders of overdue accounts, paying-in-books, are hand delivered by the enterprise staff. Metered&#13;
consumers are billed monthly on the basis of readings taken by meter readers of the enterprise.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Metered bills are either hand delivered by meter readers or posted. Domestic consumers pay their&#13;
bills mostly through banks or post offices by means of standard pre-printed paying-in-books.&#13;
4.18          Metering of apartment blocks has been identified as a key priority for basic water&#13;
demand management and conservation. Although installation of block meters started in the middle of&#13;
1993, progress has been extremely slow due to lack of available resources. Funding has been&#13;
allocated under the project for the installation of meters in each apartment block building.&#13;
4.19          The present billing system needs to be upgraded so as to provide accurate, reliable&#13;
and timely management information and accounting data. The twinning arrangement under the&#13;
project with the water utility of Tampere, Finland, is expected to provide assistance in this regard.&#13;
4.20          Poor collection performance has been a major source of financial hardship for the&#13;
enterprise. The situation has progressively become worse and uncollected bills now represent over&#13;
four months' annual billing. The major difficulty is with industrial consumers who account for 62%&#13;
of uncollected bills (237 days of billing), followed by municipal enterprises (121 days), and domestic&#13;
consumers (61 days). Bad debts at present are estimated at Ls. 300,000. The future levels of bad&#13;
debts will be gradually brought down against set targets: 15% for 1996, 10% for 1997 to 1999,&#13;
7.5% for 2000, and 5% thereafter. It was also agreed with DMEU that consumer receivables, net&#13;
of bad debts, will not exceed 60 days' annual billing from end 1996 onwards and that the&#13;
municipality will allow DMEU to undertake disconnection of customers and other actions as&#13;
necessary to achieve this ratio. [para 6.1(i)].&#13;
E. Future Financial Performance&#13;
4.21          In all cases, there is need for substantial improvement in financial performance of the&#13;
municipal enterprises involved in the project. In particular, there is a need for improvement on direct&#13;
and indirect cost recovery as necessary to improve key financial ratios, to maintain appropriate debt&#13;
service coverage and to provide for adequate maintenance and future investment.  Each of the&#13;
enterprises will be required to maintain user charges and transfers sufficient to maintain: debt&#13;
service coverage of 1.3 times, positive net income and appropriate return on assets. Detailed&#13;
financial projections have been prepared for existing enterprises and special issues and conditions are&#13;
summarized below. (See also Annex C).&#13;
4.22          Riga Urban Transport. Financial projections prepared during the development of&#13;
detailed business plans for Imanta, Talava and the Tram and Trolleybus Park suggest that financial&#13;
performance can improve to desired levels provided that: (i) the municipality maintain the current&#13;
level of subsidy indefinitely; (ii) the municipality compensate municipal public transport operators for&#13;
carrying passengers at concessionary fares; (iii) a mechanism for increasing real fares and transfers to&#13;
cost recovery levels; and (iv) improved revenue controls and inspection are instituted that would&#13;
reduce fare evasion 50% by increasing the number of inspectors and increasing the amount of fines.&#13;
In addition, revenue will be increased and operating costs reduced through the project itself as it will&#13;
allow for the acquisition of new vehicles, retirement of the more dilapidated vehicles, provision for&#13;
adequate maintenance of vehicle fleet, and technical support and training.&#13;
4.23          The City of Riga will be required to maintain user charges and transfers&#13;
sufficient to enable the three public transport companies to achieve: debt-service coverage of&#13;
1.3 times, positive net income and a return on net assets of 10% from 1997 onwards. [para&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
6.1(j)]. The Riga City Council has agreed to an annual 5 % real increase in fares over the project&#13;
period over and above inflation and increases in input costs and taxes. The Riga City Council has&#13;
also agreed to compensate the transport companies for losses due to carrying passengers at&#13;
concessionary fares. The precise mechanism for determining such compensation will have to be&#13;
developed; however, preliminary estimates suggest that this will require approximately Ls. 1.6 million&#13;
per year out of the municipal budget or approximately 2.6% of total city revenues for 1995.&#13;
Increased costs of inspection are expected to be defrayed by increased fines.&#13;
4.24          If these conditions are adopted it is expected that cash flow generated will not only be&#13;
sufficient to cover the costs of debt service but would also allow for an adequate ongoing program of&#13;
fleet renewal within three to four years. The companies will thus be in a position to bring down and&#13;
maintain the average age of the fleet to the generally accepted norms within the medium term. In the&#13;
long term, a balance will need to be achieved between the levels of investments and payment of&#13;
dividends to shareholders. The financial projections have assumed no dividend payments.&#13;
4.25          Daugavpils Water and Wastewater. Recent tariff increases will enable DMEU to&#13;
meet current operating expenses. However, further tariff increases would need to be implemented&#13;
over the next five years to raise combined tariffs for all customers to 23.4 santimes per m3 of water&#13;
sold (estimated in 1995 prices), excluding 18% VAT, to cover increased operating costs as required&#13;
to adequately maintain equipment, achieve financial viability and meet the proposed financial targets&#13;
set under the project. The schedule for these increases is summarized in Table 4.4. In addition to&#13;
the required 1.3 times debt service coverage, the utility would be expected to achieve a positive&#13;
net income and a minimum annual return on net assets of 1.5% from 1997 onwards. [para 6.1&#13;
(k)].&#13;

effects of inflation and exchange rate movements in the future. Actual tariffs charged would have to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
be higher. Based on domestic inflation projections, the nominal tariffs indicated are given in Table&#13;
4.5.&#13;

4.27         These tariff increases have been calculated assuming substantial donor contributions&#13;
towards the construction of the wastewater collection and treatment facilities, and including cost&#13;
savings due to phase out of surface water treatment. The tariff increases also allow for: (a) write-off&#13;
of existing bad debts and repayment in equal installments of existing backlog of unpaid taxes due to&#13;
the municipality over the next five years; (b) future levels of bad debts as noted above; (c) consumer&#13;
receivables, after bad debts not exceeding 60 days' annual billing from end 1996 onwards; (d) staff&#13;
reduction (through attrition) of 5% in 1996 and 5% in 1997; (e) annual payroll increases of 3% in&#13;
real terms to allow for recruitment of new staff, and for motivation and retention of staff; and (f)&#13;
adjustments of norms for household water consumption to actual measured levels by completion of&#13;
block and bulk metering program by 1998.&#13;
4.28          With these tariff increases, DMEU would be able to substantially improve key&#13;
financial performance ratios including appropriate debt service coverage, positive cash flow and&#13;
improved maintenance practices. From 2000 onwards, the utility will also be in a position to finance,&#13;
from internally generated funds, an ongoing capital investment program of rehabilitation of the main&#13;
water network over a long term period.&#13;
F. Affordability&#13;
4.29          An assessment of the affordability of the user charge increases discussed above for&#13;
each of the investment programs has been made and suggests that the resulting charges are, in all&#13;
cases, reasonable and affordable and will not require any modification to existing social support&#13;
programs. As user charge increases will be necessary for all services including those not involved in&#13;
the present project, affordability has been evaluated by comparison of share of household expenditure&#13;
on affected services as compared to international averages.&#13;
4.30          Riga Urban Transport. Monthly ticket prices of Ls. 3.5 for adults represent only 4%&#13;
of the current monthly wage. (The national average wage is Ls. 85 per month. Though Riga wages&#13;
are known to be higher, no recent information is available on wage data for the city so the national&#13;
average is used as a conservative estimate.) Concessionary monthly fares for pensioners of Ls. 1.35&#13;
amount to only 4.5% of the average pensioner's income. Annual fare increases of 5% in real terms&#13;
will result in a 48% cumulative increase by the end of 8 years. At that point, monthly fares would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
still amount to only about 6% of monthly wages. Furthermore, it can be expected that real wages&#13;
would also have increased. This compares to a norm of 10% in most other middle income countries.4&#13;
4.31          Daugavpils Water and Wastewater. User charges in Daugavpils have until recently&#13;
been quite low in comparison with those in other cities. Riga has a combined charge of 17 santimes&#13;
per m3 of water for households and 25 santimes per m3 for industry. In Liepaja, the combined&#13;
household charge is 11 santimes and 28 santimes for industry. The recent increase in household user&#13;
charges from 7 to 12.5 santimes is appropriate and brings tariff levels in Daugavpils to a level&#13;
comparable with other Latvian cities. Further increases to 23.4 santimes over a five year period&#13;
would be necessary to support increased costs associated with improved wastewater treatment and&#13;
increased depreciation charges due to the new investments. (All tariff levels are quoted in 1995&#13;
constant terms).&#13;
4.32          The recently adopted tariff amounts to 95 santimes per person per month based on&#13;
average billed consumption of 250 liters per day. With an average household size of 2.4, this&#13;
amounts to Ls. 2.28 per family per month or approximately 1.9% of household income (estimated for&#13;
Daugavpils as 117 lats per month on average). This compares to a norm of 3 to 5 percent used to&#13;
evaluate the affordability of other water sector projects. Even after full phase-in of all tariff increases&#13;
necessary to finance the project and increase in the billed quantities to actual consumption levels, total&#13;
expenditure on water and wastewater would amount to Ls. 4.78 per household per month or roughly&#13;
4.1 % of household income. This is estimated conservatively and does not include any assumption of&#13;
an increase in per capita income over the period. (This does not include VAT, as charges for&#13;
municipal services are exempted as of November 1995).&#13;
G. Organizational Issues&#13;
4.33          Municipal enterprises already enjoy a substantial degree of autonomy and are run as&#13;
separate budgetary entities by independent enterprise directors appointed by the respective city&#13;
council. Increased autonomy would be achieved under the project by strengthening of contractual&#13;
arrangements between the municipality and the municipal enterprises, encouragement of movement&#13;
towards full incorporation as a joint stock company in combination with suitable contractual and&#13;
regulatory arrangements deemed necessary to protect the public interest, and by improvement of the&#13;
basis for determination of tariff levels. Introduction of these measures should ensure that municipal&#13;
enterprises involved in the project have sufficient resources to maintain new equipment and facilities&#13;
and appropriate incentives to increase operational efficiency.&#13;
4.34          It should be noted, however, that most municipal enterprises are afflicted with&#13;
substantial operational inefficiencies. Overstaffing is a problem at all levels and departments and is&#13;
exacerbated by management practices. Financial accounting systems are inefficient, antiquated and do&#13;
not provide appropriate management information. Maintenance and operations protocols are poor.&#13;
Despite substantial management autonomy, little has been done to address these problems and&#13;
technical assistance will be required to allow for exposure to new management techniques and&#13;
approaches.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
4.35          Specific measures proposed to address these problems are detailed below.&#13;
4.36          Riga Urban Transport. Draft contracts between the municipality and the three public&#13;
transport enterprises have been prepared. These establish the terms and conditions for service&#13;
delivery and the rights and responsibilities of the enterprises relative to the municipality and vice&#13;
versa. The contracts will provide guidelines for determination of fares and will establish a&#13;
mechanism to provide for compensation for concessionary fares. The city has presented a proposal&#13;
for the rationalization of fares during the appraisal and this will be implemented by the PTU.&#13;
Adoption of satisfactory contractual arrangements will be required as a condition of&#13;
effectiveness. [para 6.3(c)] Movement towards incorporation of the three companies is being&#13;
discussed; however, it has so far been rejected by the municipality given that most of the benefits of&#13;
joint stock company status already apply to municipal enterprises.&#13;
4.37          Detailed business plans have been developed with the assistance of consultants&#13;
financed under the Japanese Grant and have been agreed with the three public transport enterprises.&#13;
Key points of the business plans are as follows:&#13;
(a) The staff to vehicle ratio should be reduced by at least 10% over the next several years. This&#13;
can be easily implemented through attrition.&#13;
(b) Improved revenue, costing and inventory control systems should be implemented as necessary&#13;
to improve efficiency and effectiveness of administrative staff. Adoption of a revenue,&#13;
costing and inventory control system acceptable to the Bank will be required by June 1,&#13;
1996. [para 6.1(1)]&#13;
(c) Funding for piloting of ticketing systems is included under the project and will be evaluated as&#13;
a measure to decrease fare evasion as well as to collect information necessary for&#13;
rationalization of routing structure.&#13;
4.38          Daugavpils Water and Wastewater. It has been agreed with the municipality during&#13;
appraisal that the contract and enterprise statutes for DMEU would be revised to formalize the&#13;
relationship between the utility and the municipality. Conclusion of a contract between the City of&#13;
Daugavpils and DMEU will be required as a condition of effectiveness. [para 6.3(d)] A key issue&#13;
to be addressed in the contract is the establishment of a formal mechanism for determination of user&#13;
charges. It is also being proposed that the enterprise be incorporated as a joint stock company&#13;
wholly owned by the municipality. Further analysis of this issue will be one of the elements of the&#13;
twinning arrangement. Daugavpils will be required to present a reorganization plan for DMEU&#13;
by January 1, 1997, and undertake its implementation by December 31, 1997. [para 6. l(m)].&#13;
4.39          The situation regarding overstaffing at the enterprise has been discussed, and the&#13;
municipality has agreed in principle to separation of the internal plumbing maintenance unit from&#13;
DMEU which will reduce headcount by approximately 10 percent. Further reductions of 10% over&#13;
the next two years are assumed in the financial projections and can be achieved easily through&#13;
attrition. Other organizational weaknesses in finance and operations will be addressed through the&#13;
twinning arrangement with the water utility of Tampere, Finland.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

V. PROJECT BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. Project Benefits&#13;
5.1           The project supports the development of municipal infrastructure identified as a&#13;
priority by the Government of Latvia in its Public Investment Program and by the World Bank in its&#13;
CAS. The project will provide for a number of critically needed investments for priority sub-projects&#13;
identified by the state and local governments with the assistance of the World Bank and donors during&#13;
project preparation. The project will also support the implementation of a number of necessary&#13;
financial, operational and regulatory reforms needed to ensure the sustainability of the proposed&#13;
investment program and to allow for the future development of the municipal sector. Implementation&#13;
of agreed policy measures and further conditions under discussion will lead to increased commercial&#13;
viability of the enterprises participating in the project and will form the basis for potential increased&#13;
private sector involvement in municipal services in the future. Improvement of the financial condition&#13;
of municipal services enterprises and increased movement towards cost recovery will also limit&#13;
demands on local government resources. The project supports the government's efforts towards&#13;
decentralization by providing local governments with a source of investment funding for priority&#13;
projects.&#13;
5.2           Specific benefits of sub-projects are noted below. A discussion of assumptions and&#13;
calculations is contained in Annex F.&#13;
5.3           Riga Urban Transport. The purchase of new articulated buses and trolleybuses, and&#13;
the disposal of the oldest buses and trolleybuses, will improve the overall performance of the public&#13;
transport fleets and will prevent the continued deterioration that would occur without the project.&#13;
This, together with the supply of spares and improvements to trains, will permit maintenance staff&#13;
reductions and would effect substantial maintenance cost savings. Improved financial and&#13;
management information systems would allow for reduction of administrative staff. This will enable&#13;
staff reduction of 10% to be achieved through attrition within two years.&#13;
5.4           The estimated economic rate of return is 22 percent. The net present value of the&#13;
project is US$8.8 million with an assumed discount rate of 10 percent. Benefits due to reduction in&#13;
passenger waiting time have been estimated conservatively given the partial nature of the&#13;
rehabilitation effort and represent a small portion (5%) of total benefits. The majority of benefits are&#13;
due to prevention of fleet deterioration which would otherwise result in increased vehicle operation&#13;
costs. These calculations and the underlying assumptions are explained in Annex 5. The sensitivity&#13;
of the ERR was measured against project costs and assumed benefits. It is possible to maintain an&#13;
ERR of 12% with an assumed increase in project costs of 38% and an assumed decrease in benefits of&#13;
28%.&#13;
5.5           Daugavpils Water and Wastewater. Construction of a new groundwater wellfield will&#13;
enable diversification of water supplies and development of the basis for complete movement away&#13;
from surface water. Daugavpils is downstream from major chemical factories and there have been&#13;
several accidents involving accidental discharge of toxic chemicals into the river. (Several years ago&#13;
cyanide was discharged into the water and required cutting off all surface water intakes).&#13;
Diversification of water supplies will minimize the social cost of such temporary pollution incidents.&#13;
Eventual complete transition from surface water will substantially reduce the public health risks from&#13;
undetected spills. It is not possible to fully quantify the benefits of the proposed investment,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
although it can be reasonably assumed that they would be significant given the positive impact on&#13;
public health and environment. A least cost analysis was conducted using the alternative of upgrading&#13;
the surface water treatment works to include carbon filters and ozonation. Estimated costs of full&#13;
wellfield development were equivalent to construction of the new groundwater intake, though&#13;
operating costs for water treatment would be 25% higher due to chemicals costs. Although this&#13;
alternative would result in a reduction of THMs and improved water quality, it would still leave water&#13;
supplies vulnerable to sudden or undetected contamination.&#13;
5.6           The measures to be instituted in rehabilitation of the wastewater treatment works&#13;
would significantly reduce the current discharge of BOD and Nitrogen. The proposed project&#13;
supports the commitments of the Government of Latvia, as party to the Helsinki agreements, to fulfill&#13;
the recommendations of the Baltic Sea Joint Comprehensive Environmental Action Program by&#13;
reducing pollution of the Baltic Sea from a priority "hot spot". As with the water supply component,&#13;
the benefits of improved wastewater treatment are difficult to quantify. A least cost analysis was&#13;
conducted and included evaluation of simple biological treatment, biofiltration and full biological&#13;
treatment at a new site. Simple biological treatment was selected as the most cost effective solution.&#13;
5.7           Municipal Development Fund. Sub-projects to be financed under the MDF will be&#13;
identified only during project implementation. A criteria for selection of sub-projects for financing&#13;
under the MDF is that they achieve a minimum economic rate of return of 12%.&#13;
B. Project Risks&#13;
5.8           The major risks are that: (i) participating municipalities would not adhere to agreed&#13;
policy conditionality and/or financial and performance covenants including provision of counterpart&#13;
financing; (ii) inability of local governments to manage project implementation leading to construction&#13;
and procurement delays; (iii) inability of local governments to prepare satisfactory investment&#13;
proposals for financing under the MDF; and (iv) inadequate supervision of MDF projects.&#13;
5.9           These risks will be mitigated by: (i) prior agreement with municipalities on terms and&#13;
conditions required for sub-loan effectiveness and, in particular, related to financial covenants,&#13;
organizational arrangements and local counterpart financing; (ii) requirement that sub-loan agreements&#13;
between the participating municipalities and the Ministry of Finance on behalf of the Government of&#13;
Latvia enable the Ministry of Finance to deduct interest and principal repayments from taxes and&#13;
other revenues collected on behalf of local governments by the state tax administration; (iii) provision&#13;
of technical assistance for critical areas of project implementation; (iv) adequate staffing of the PMUs&#13;
for the three primary sub-projects; (v) addition of consultant staff to the PIP unit to assist with&#13;
administration of the MDF and to support municipalities in preparation and supervision of projects;&#13;
and (vi) establishment of a central Project Coordination Unit (PCU) to monitor compliance with loan&#13;
and sub-loan covenants and with project implementation timetable.&#13;

Policy Statement of the Riga City Council&#13;
on Public Transport in Riga&#13;
General&#13;
The policy of Riga City Council is to reform public transport and create market&#13;
conditions in order to improve service levels, efficiency and financial viability. it&#13;
intends to move tariffs closer to cost recovery levels, to stabilise subsidies and to&#13;
eliminate uncovered costs.. Competition will be introduced and the private sector&#13;
encouraged to participate in the provision of public transport.&#13;
The existing public transport enterprises will be required to implement agreed&#13;
business plans and to enter into contracts with the Municipality for the supply of&#13;
services.&#13;
An appropriate regulatory authority (Riga City Public Transport Unit) willbe set up&#13;
in the Transport and Communications Board to oversee public transport operators&#13;
and the ticketing system.&#13;
Tariffs&#13;
Public transport tariffs will be increased by 5% in real terms (i.e. over and above&#13;
inflation) each year until an acceptable level of financial viability is reached. Also,&#13;
the tariff structure will be rationalised in order to relate tai.ffs more closely to&#13;
distance travelled and costs, and to improve weekly and monthly passes.&#13;
Concessionary travel&#13;
The City Council intends to implement proposals to compensate operators for&#13;
providing concessionary travel. The amount of compensation will be related to the&#13;
differernce between the futl fare and the concessionary amount paid. Since the&#13;
concessions are to meet social needs the compensation will be funded from the&#13;
Social Budget.&#13;
Revenue Control Inspectors&#13;
In order to reduce the very substantial amount of tariff evasion on public transport,&#13;
the City Council intends to set up within the Municipallty a Public Transport&#13;
Revenue Control Service that will function according to the principle of self-&#13;
financing, basing on the contract between the Control Service and public transport&#13;
companies. The number of revenue control inspectors will be gradually increased.&#13;
Riga City Council will promote the increase of the fine for tariff evasion in order to&#13;
retain an appropriate deterrent. (The present fine is 0.50 Ls).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Riga City Public Transport Unit&#13;
The Riga City Council will establish an ef'ective Public Transport Unit (PTU) within&#13;
the Transport and Comnunications Board. The functions of the PTU are to:&#13;
(a) develop, oversee, monitor, and coordinate public transport services;&#13;
(b) draw up contracts with public transport operators regarding levels of&#13;
service, routes, tariffs, subsidies and concessionary travel compensation;&#13;
(c) oversee the tariffs and ticketing system, including the gathering and&#13;
distribution of revenue, and the revenue inspection teams;&#13;
(d) develop and administer a public transport vehicle and operator licensing&#13;
system;&#13;
(e) oversee the implementation of the public transport component of the&#13;
project funded by the World Bank.&#13;
The PTU will be provided with adequate staff, taking into account the proposals of&#13;
the World Bank experts, in order to undertake these functions effectively.&#13;
Municipal Public Transport Enterprises&#13;
The Riga City Council intends that the municipal public transport enterprises will&#13;
follow sound commercial practices. This will involve each enterprise having a&#13;
board of director, separate accounts and detailed costing and revenue accounting&#13;
system. The management of each enterprise will be answerable to its board of&#13;
director, and will act within the framework of the agreed business plan. The&#13;
management and staff will receive appropriate incentives for good performance.&#13;
The enterprises will enter into contracts with the Municipality for the supply of&#13;
services which will be overseen by the PTU, as above. Each board of directors will&#13;
include a representative of the Municipality.&#13;
To increase efficiency, it is intended that the contract system will encourage the&#13;
Municipal public transport enterprises to compete amongst themselves for routes.&#13;
Also the enterprises will not be protected from any healthy competition from the&#13;
private sector should this arise.&#13;
The aim is that the Municipal public transport enterprises will gradually improve&#13;
their economic activities that could stirnulate the at-raction of the local and foreign&#13;
investments.&#13;
Implementation of Actiom Plans&#13;
In order to reap the full benefits of the World Bank loan, the Riga City Council will&#13;
ensure that the bodies concerned (i.e. the Municipality, IMAANTA, TALAVA, and&#13;
TTP) effectively implement all the Action Plans set out in the agreed Business&#13;
Plans For Public Transport Enterprises.&#13;
Participation of the Private Sector&#13;
The policy of the Riga City Council is to promote efficient competition and to&#13;
encourage the participation of the private sector in the provision of public&#13;
transport services. The City will perrnit private operators to operate public&#13;
transport services provided that the vehicles meet safety and environmental&#13;
standards and the operator can demonstrate evidence of professional competence.&#13;
Also, PTU may issue contracts to private operators for the provision of required&#13;
services, and to permit them to take part, as appropriate, in the ticketing system&#13;
and concessionary travel compensation scheme.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX A&#13;
Page 3 of 3&#13;
To encourage private investment in public transport, and to improve the&#13;
opportunities of the private sector to obtain funding, private operators will be&#13;
provided with an appropriate regulatory and legal environment.&#13;
Non-rnotorised transport&#13;
In view of the very considerable economic and environmental benefits of non-&#13;
motorised transport, the Riga City Council intends to promote greater use of non-&#13;
rnotorised modes (cycling and walking). The opportunities will be exarnined and a&#13;
programme developed for the provision of facilities for cyclists and pedestrians&#13;
together with appropriate publicity.&#13;

1. Introduction&#13;
1.1    The Municipal Development Fund (MDF) is administered by the Public Investment Program&#13;
Department (PIPD) of the Ministry of Economy (MoE). These guidelines are issued by the&#13;
Department in order to regulate submission of projects for financing from the MDF. They state&#13;
requirements and procedures of submission of projects with which applicants must comply.&#13;
2. Objective of the MDF&#13;
2.1    The main objective of the MDF is to mobilize resources from private lenders, central&#13;
government, donor agencies, and local governments themselves and make them available for&#13;
municipalities for investment in urban infrastructure. Thus the MDF is an additional source of funds&#13;
for the municipalities to finance projects being under their responsibility described in the law "On the&#13;
municipalities." Other objectives include strengthening the operational capacity and efficiency of local&#13;
governments by assisting them in the design, appraisal, and execution of investment programs;&#13;
rationalizing programs moving away from the ad hoc investment practices; and injecting rational&#13;
criteria into the geographical and sectoral distribution of funds.&#13;
2.2    The MDF is particularly well suited to the needs of smaller cities, which may lack&#13;
administrative skills and access to capital markets.&#13;
2.3    The Fund commences its activity with an initial capital of 3.5 million USD loan from the&#13;
World Bank. Financing from the state budget and other sources is foreseen also at the later stage. The&#13;
loan is made to the Government of Latvia (GoL) and will be on-lent to participating municipalities to&#13;
implement the proposed sub-projects. The funds can in turn be lent by the municipalities to the&#13;
concerned municipal enterprises. In some circumstances it is possible to lend directly to the&#13;
municipal enterprise upon obtaining a suitable guarantee from the municipality. In both cases, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX B&#13;
Page 2 of 10&#13;
municipality is responsible for repayment of the sub-loan in case of default by the municipal&#13;
enterprise.&#13;
3. Supervisory bodies of the MDF&#13;
3.1    The Fund is governed by the Board of the MDF approved by the Cabinet of Ministers. The&#13;
Board consists of one representative from Ministry of Economy, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of&#13;
Environmental Protection and Regional Development and the Union of Local Governments. The&#13;
Board approves financing of projects from the MDF. During the Board approval session a&#13;
representative from the corresponding sector ministry shall be present (with voting right).&#13;
4. Projects eligible under financing from the MDF&#13;
4.1    Only investment projects in the area of municipal services meeting assessed needs and&#13;
reflecting both of the local communities' and national priorities. Those project by sector are:&#13;
(a)    Energy:&#13;
(i)    rehabilitation and construction of heating supply systems and boiler houses;&#13;
(ii)   rehabilitation and construction of gas supply networks; energy saving by&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX B&#13;
Page 3 of 10&#13;
5. Servicing fee&#13;
5.1    To cover operational expenses of the MDF a service fee shall be added to the interest rate of&#13;
the loan. This fee shall cover costs and salaries of specialists hired by the MDF for project appraisal&#13;
(civil construction engineer, a project economist). Procurement and disbursement will be the&#13;
responsibility of the MoF, and the work of the members of the Board corresponding to their input.&#13;
6. Project appraisal criteria&#13;
6.1   Submitted projects should be subjected to cost benefit analysis or should have a business plan.&#13;
Alternatives should be adequately assessed and the least cost solution (investment plus recurrent&#13;
costs). Projects should meet existing technical, construction and environmental standards and&#13;
regulations;&#13;
6.2   The economic rate of return should be demonstrated to be over 12%;&#13;
6.3   For revenue generating sectors the financial feasibility of proposed investments should be&#13;
made and a plan for cost recovery (including proper maintenance) provided. Financial projections&#13;
should be made including income statements, balance sheets and cash flows of the project owner. A&#13;
minimum debt service coverage of 1.3 should be maintained by the enterprise or department&#13;
implementing the project. Minimum cost recovery targets should be set by the sector. If tariff&#13;
increases for municipal services are necessary to meet these targets, then this should be formally&#13;
agreed with the Council of the municipality and the agreement submitted prior to approval of&#13;
sub-project;&#13;
6.4   Borrowers should demonstrate their existing financial, technical and administrative capability&#13;
to operate and maintain the proposed services. Borrowers should demonstrate also adequate project&#13;
management capacity to design and supervise project implementation and control project costs.&#13;
Where necessary, borrowers should be required to take necessary steps to improve their capability in&#13;
these areas, or to restructure the public utilities enterprises to meet the requirements;&#13;
6.5   Environmental impact analysis (EIA) of proposed investments should be made and necessary&#13;
mitigation measures built into project according to the Latvian law on environment protection and&#13;
rules of the World Bank;&#13;
6.6   During the first cycle the participation of the MDF in financing should not exceed the amount&#13;
of 500,000 Ls and the share of the MDF can not exceed 80% of the total project costs. At least 10%&#13;
of the cost of the project has to be covered by the borrowing municipality;&#13;
6.7   The MDF can participate in financing only of those projects which exceed 20-30% of the total&#13;
budget of the borrowing municipality and which could not reasonably be financed by the municipality&#13;
on its own within 34 years. Debt servicing payments may not exceed 15% of the yearly budget of&#13;
the borrowing municipality in cost recovering sectors or 7-10% if the credit is repaid by the&#13;
municipal budget;&#13;
6.8   MDF credits for sectors covered by special budgets such as Road Fund, Environment&#13;
Protection Fund etc., can be issued only if at least 20% of corresponding municipal special budget is&#13;
allocated for this project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX B&#13;
Page 4 of 10&#13;
Box 1. The Project Concept Paper&#13;
The Project Concept Paper (PCP) should be used to seek out the views of the Government and&#13;
other stakeholders at an early stage of the project cycle. The paper should specific the objectives of the&#13;
proposed project, the problem it intends to address, the alternative ways of addressing the problems, the&#13;
potential benefits/costs and the intended beneficiaries and potential losers. It shall be submitted at the&#13;
standard Form (see Annex A)&#13;
7. Terms of loans&#13;
7.1    The loans for the MDF will be given for up to 17 years depending on the nature of the&#13;
investment and corresponding to the benefit stream of the investment. Repayment has to be started&#13;
after completing the construction but not later than after 1/4 of the whole loan period.&#13;
7.2    Funds disbursement from proceeds of the World Bank loan must satisfy World Bark&#13;
procurement procedures. For projects below 25,000 Ls local shopping shall be applied. For civil&#13;
construction works between 25,000 and 150,000 Ls, national shopping will apply. For goods&#13;
contracts between 25.000 and 150,000 Ls international shopping will apply. International competitive&#13;
bidding (ICB) will be used for all contracts over 150,000 Ls. All ICB contracts will require prior&#13;
review by the Bank.&#13;
7.3    The World Bank would review the first 3 projects on no objection basis and any individual&#13;
project larger than 250.000 Ls.&#13;
7.4    Funds on-lent from proceeds of the World Bank could, with the approval of the MoF, be&#13;
recycled.&#13;
8. Project submission procedure&#13;
8.1    To receive financing from the MDF municipal projects must be included into&#13;
the PIP. Thus the submission cycle is similar to the process of submission of the other PIP projects.&#13;
To be included into the PIP all projects must be submitted to the PIPD.&#13;
8.2    The project submission cycle begins with the Project Concept Paper (PCP) which shall be&#13;
submitted to the PIPD (See Box 1). The PCPs can be submitted throughout the whole year, however&#13;
they shall be reviewed four times a year during the first week of the quarter. The idea behind the&#13;
PCP is that the applicants should not waste resources on feasibility studies of projects which have no&#13;
chance of being included into the PIP. The crucial part of the PCP is the financial information (see&#13;
Box 2) about the applicant/enterprise which allows the PIPD to assess his financial viability, technical&#13;
and administrative capability to operate and maintain the proposed services. The PCP shall be&#13;
approved by the highest elected body of the municipality (Council). An opinion of an appropriate&#13;
sector ministry should be supplemented.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX B&#13;
Page 5 of 10&#13;
8.3    The paper should be made jointly by applicant, potential source of financing, and discussed&#13;
with other stakeholders including potential beneficiaries/affected parties. The final version should be&#13;
submitted to the PIPD consideration. In reviewing the PCP, the PIPD examines:&#13;
-the consistency of the proposed project with the MDF requirements;&#13;
-whether the proposed intervention is consistent with the sectoral and national priorities;&#13;
-whether the borrowers can demonstrate financial, technical and administrative capability to&#13;
operate and maintain the proposed services.&#13;
8.4    On the basis of the recommendations of the PIPD, the MDF Board sends a formal letter to&#13;
the sector municipality indicating: (i) formal approval to appraise the project; (ii) a delay of appraisal&#13;
pending further discussions of the proposals; or (iii) a rejection of the project. In case of formal&#13;
approval to appraise the project, the letter will also specify required issues to be addressed during&#13;
appraisal.&#13;
8.5    After having received a formal approval from the MDF the applicant can proceed with the&#13;
project appraisal. After having completed the appraisal the application shall be submitted to the PIPD.&#13;
The project application dossier shall contain:&#13;
- the project profile (see Annex B also filled in English);&#13;
- the feasibility study;&#13;
- opinion of the appropriate sector ministry.&#13;
8.6    The PIPD shall screen the project verify/make an financial and economical analysis of the&#13;
project and recommend only sound projects to the Board for approval.&#13;
8.7    Procurement procedures are to be made by the borrower in cooperation with the MOF.&#13;
Payment is made by the MoF.&#13;
9. Procedures for projects submission to the PIPD&#13;
The process of submission of a project to the PIPD relies on a sequence of the following procedures:&#13;
9.1.    Preparation of the Project Concept Paper by the applicant and discussion of the paper with&#13;
various stakeholders;&#13;
9.2.    Submission of the PCP (on the standard form) to the PIPD for consideration. MDF Board&#13;
upon the PIPD recommendation decides what steps should be next, in particular, to appraise or not&#13;
appraise. The Board notifies the line ministry giving clearance for appraisal and/or indicates&#13;
any other actions that needs to be taken;&#13;
9.3.    Project Appraisal. The appraisal report should respond to issues raised by the project&#13;
screening criteria in Box 2 and specific issues raised in the Board decision to appraise the project;&#13;
9.4.    Preparation of the project feasibility study by the applicant;&#13;
9.5.   Submission of the project profile form and PAM to the PIPD for inclusion into the PIP and&#13;
financing from the MDF.&#13;

Box 3. Overview of External Financial Statements&#13;
The: Income. Statement reports the profit performance of a business entity. The term  profit is used widely though:is frequently&#13;
: substituted by  the technical term  net income. The model for the income statement is: REVENUES - EXPENSES  =  NET&#13;
:;:INC:OMED:0  !   ::-  X         :   &#13;
Angirncomestatement reports the revenues an expenses for a specified period. Revenues cause inflows of resources: into a&#13;
business, and expensesJcause outflows of resources. Income statements report revenues, expenses, and net income for a specified&#13;
: 1perid of time, e.g., fortAhe year ended December 31, 1995.&#13;
TJheBalance Sheet treports thefinancial position of a business atva particular point of time. Financial position is the amount. of&#13;
resources: ithat is,j assets and the liabilities, i.e., debts of a business. Therefore, the balance sheet is frequently called the. statement&#13;
gnoffinanial position. lhe:accounting model for the balance sheet is: ASSETS = LIABIITIES + OWNERS' EQU)ITY. Assets&#13;
represent resources owned yb the entity, liabilities are the debts (obligations):of the entity, owners' equity represents: interests of&#13;
the owners,&#13;

PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN&#13;
I. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
A. Project Implementation Responsibilities&#13;
1.    Table A3. 1 summarizes the respective responsibilities of the different implementing and&#13;
coordinating agencies involved in the proposed Project and its three component parts.&#13;
B. Role of the World Bank During Supervision&#13;
2.     The proposed Project would be supervised by Bank personnel from both headquarters and the&#13;
Regional Mission for the Baltic Countries. In addition technical specialists from The Swedish Ministry&#13;
of Environment, the Finnish Ministry of Environment and the Danish Ministry of Environment,&#13;
together with personnel from NEFCO and EU PHARE, would participate in supervision missions.&#13;
The proposed supervision plan is summarized in Table A3.2.&#13;
3.    Recognizing that the proposed Project would be only the third Bank Project in Latvia&#13;
involving large scale construction of civil works and installation of sophisticated mechanical and&#13;
electrical equipment, and the first with a component in the cities of Riga and Daugavpils, it is&#13;
anticipated that it would require significant supervision. The supervision would concentrate on the&#13;
first two years when considerable input would be required for the engineering design and the&#13;
procurement aspects of the Riga Urban Transport and the Daugavpils Water and Wastewater&#13;
components. In addition, supervision by technical specialists would be required for the respective&#13;
project components, as described in the following sections. Savings would be realized by utilizing&#13;
staff from the Bank resident mission for project supervision. During the first year of implementation,&#13;
a project launch workshop would be organized to provide basic training for the staff of the&#13;
implementing agencies in procurement, disbursement, accounting and auditing.&#13;
4.    It is anticipated that about 22 staff-weeks of effort for the first two years and about 10 staff-&#13;
weeks thereafter would be required for supervision. Following the start-up mission and the project&#13;
launch workshop, supervision requirements in the first two years would include two supervision&#13;
missions per year to coincide with the production of the semi-annual progress reports by the&#13;
respective implementing agencies. In later years, one supervision mission would be conducted each&#13;
year, timed to coincide with one of that year's progress reports. The final supervision mission would&#13;
be to prepare the Project completion report.&#13;
5.    A mid-term review would be conducted to evaluate project progress in general (in terms of&#13;
procurement, disbursements, status of construction works and other implementational aspects) and to&#13;
assess the status of agreed policy and institutional reforms.&#13;

LATVIA MUNICIPAL SERVICES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
Riga Urban Transport Component&#13;
Terms of Reference for the Riga Municipality Public Transport Unit&#13;
1.    Riga Municipality will have a key role in creating the appropriate institutional framework for&#13;
the transition to a market-led public transport sector in Riga. It will be important for the development&#13;
of the city's public transport service that local elected deputies are seen to be fully accountable for the&#13;
coordination and monitoring of service quality standards. The PTU will thus have to demonstrate&#13;
strong leadership and give clear direction to the operating enterprises in order to create confidence in&#13;
the local community.&#13;
2.     The overall strategic objectives of the PTU are as follows:&#13;
2.1    To design and secure the provision of a high quality, comprehensive, public transport&#13;
network, with appropriate time tabling which maximizes passenger benefits and&#13;
therefore maximizes patronage.&#13;
2.2    To ensure that resources and subsidies are effectively deployed across the network in&#13;
line with current and expected demand.&#13;
2.3    To ensure that subsidies provide good value for money, to be monitored by measuring&#13;
on-vehicle patronage.&#13;
2.4    To oversee the fares and ticketing systems to ensure that fraud is minimized.&#13;
2.5    To encourage the three public companies to produce constructive proposals to improve&#13;
the network and reduce the required subsidy levels.&#13;
2.6    To encourage operators to produce appropriate and sufficient publicity and&#13;
information to ensure that the use of services is maximized.&#13;
2.7    To administer and develop the vehicle and operator licensing system so that it can be&#13;
readily expanded to allow the introduction of more private operators.&#13;
2.7    To reduce the barriers to the entry of new operators so that healthy competition can&#13;
be encouraged.&#13;
3.    The detailed objectives of the PTU are stated below:&#13;
3.1    To monitor the operator's performance against agreed target measures (including&#13;
quality and safety standards) as defined in the schedules to the contracts between the&#13;
municipality and the enterprises.&#13;
3.2    To control the issue of operating licenses and their related inspection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX C&#13;
Page 8 of 71&#13;
3.3    To ensure that market changes are determined by survey and analyzed, and that the&#13;
survey outputs are distributed to all operators to ensure maximum service provision.&#13;
3.4    To promote the development of traffic management schemes in the interest of&#13;
improving on-street operating conditions for all public modes of transport.&#13;
3.5    To design the route network.&#13;
3.6    To develop fares and subsidy policies.&#13;
3.7    To monitor contracts with the public transport enterprises.&#13;
3.8    To take responsibility for administering the ticketing system and the revenue control&#13;
inspectors.&#13;
4.     Riga City Council, in turn, should carry out the following basic tasks:&#13;
4.1    To oversee and monitor the development and implementation of the initial public&#13;
transport survey and resultant demand model which is to be carried out by the Danish&#13;
consultants RH&amp;H in the second half of 1995.&#13;
4.2    To ensure that the model is updated and refined periodically as passenger demand&#13;
changes over time.&#13;
4.3   In conjunction with the main public transport operators, to design a public transport&#13;
network which specifies routes, service frequencies and a quality standard.&#13;
4.4    To consider the optimum balance between fare levels and the required subsidy.&#13;
4.5    To design and update the Riga concession fare policy, to monitor its use and to ensure&#13;
fair financial compensation among all operators.&#13;
4.6    To produce all public transport tickets and to distribute them to agents throughout&#13;
the city; to collect all off-vehicle revenue and to re-distribute revenues among&#13;
operators in proportion to passenger kilometres carried.&#13;
4.7    To take direct responsibility for the Riga-wide revenue control inspectors and charge&#13;
an appropriate penalty fare to act as a deterrent to fares evasion. Any such monies&#13;
raised will be retained by the public transport unit to offset the costs of the&#13;
inspectors.&#13;
4.8    To monitor the improving performance of the three Municipal Enterprises - TTP,&#13;
Imanta and Talava. These companies will remain in the ownership of Riga City&#13;
Council for a period of at least three years to allow the full benefits of the initiatives&#13;
proposed in the Business Plan to take effect before any possible privatisation.&#13;
4.9    To move towards the establishment of legal contracts between Riga City Council and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX C&#13;
Page 9 of 71&#13;
the three operating companies regarding levels of service, fares service quality and&#13;
subsidy for a period of one or more years. These contracts will initially cover all the&#13;
routes operated by each company, but will be capable of development over time to&#13;
introduce elements of competitive lendering among the three companies and any other&#13;
public transport operators.&#13;
4.10   To promote the public transport network by the provision of appropriate passenger&#13;
information at key points throughout the city.&#13;
4.11   To oversee the disbursement and monitor the effects of any funds or assets which may&#13;
be provided by the World Bank or any other development agency.&#13;
5.    In addition to the above-described, long term, broad responsibilities of the PTU, the unit will&#13;
also have the medium term responsibility of coordinating the execution of those elements of the&#13;
Municipal Services Development Project related to the Riga urban transport component. The PTU&#13;

PTU in this context will include:&#13;
5.1    Coordinate, on behalf of Riga City Council (RCC), the relations between RCC, the&#13;
World Bank, and any consultants and contractors appointed under the component.&#13;
5.2    Monitor the use of the World Bank loan.&#13;

letters of invitations for any consultancies to be carried out under the project; prepare&#13;
short-lists of consultants to be invited to submit proposals; prepare technical&#13;
specifications and associated bidding documents for the various bidding packages to be&#13;
carried out under the project; issue documentation to consultants and contractors,&#13;
respond to queries raised, and issue addenda as necessary; evaluate consultants&#13;
statements of capability and contractors prequalification documents; evaluate&#13;

V. MONITORING, EVALUATION AND REPORTING&#13;
A. Monitoring Indicators&#13;
9. Project monitoring indicators have been established in order to enable the tracking of project inputs on key&#13;
development objectives throughout the project cycle. At the mid-term review the need to adjust or restructure the&#13;
project design, within the context of its overall development objectives, would be based on the data received&#13;
from these indicators. The overarching development objective of the proposed Project is to improve the financial&#13;
and operational management of municipal services in Latvia. The key indicators that will be used to monitor the&#13;
anticipated amelioration in the provision of municipal services will be: (i) improved cost recovery; (ii) improved&#13;
financial health (as measured by the cash flow and return on assets); and (iii) improved operational performance&#13;
(as indicated by, for example, reduced effluent pollution and reduced unaccounted for water volumes in&#13;
Daugavpils, and reduced fare evasion and public vehicle breakdowns in Riga). These specific monitoring&#13;
indicators will be indicative of the improved performance of the municipal services. They, together with&#13;
associated indicators, are presented in the following tables.&#13;
10.  Given the essential role that program monitoring and evaluation play in determining the impact of a given&#13;
intervention on development objectives, a number of indicators would be used to monitor and evaluate progress&#13;
during the implementation of the Project. The commercial, financial and operational indicators presented in the&#13;
following tables would be used to monitor the respective sub-projects.&#13;
11. Municipal Development Fund: The financial, commercial and operational monitoring indicators for the&#13;
sub-projects identified and implemented under the Municipal Development Fund, would be agreed as each&#13;
potential sub-project is developed. The indicators would be used to monitor the progress and effectiveness of the&#13;
sub-projects by measuring parameters similar to those identified for the two main Project components described&#13;
above. The indicators adopted for additional sub-projects would have to be acceptable to the World Bank.&#13;

ANNEX D&#13;
Page I of 7&#13;
DAUGAVPILS WATER AND WASTEWATER COMPONENT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
A.Overview&#13;
1.    Implementation of the proposed project is anticipated to have positive environmental benefits&#13;
through improvement of water quality in the River Daugava and reduced pollution of the Baltic Sea&#13;
due to significant improvements in the performance of the municipal wastewater treatment plant.&#13;
2.    The proposed project component was the subject of an environmental review prepared by Saur&#13;
International (France)/Dynamco (United Kingdom), working in association with Aqua Brambis&#13;
(Latvia). The review was consistent with the requirement of the World Bank for a Category B project&#13;
and complies with the Latvian Law on Environmental Impact Assessment. The objective was to&#13;
evaluate the potential environmental impact from the reconstruction and rehabilitation program to be&#13;
carried out by Daugavpils Municipal Enterprise Udensvads (DMEU) under the project. The study&#13;
was conducted using a site-specific approach.&#13;
3.    The environmental review of the proposed project was prepared with the full cooperation of&#13;
the Latvian Ministry of Environmental Protection and Regional Development (MOERD) and its&#13;
Daugavpils Regional Environmental Protection Committee. Representatives of the MOERD and its&#13;
Environmental Assessment Board have been involved in all stages of development of the proposed&#13;
project and have participated in a series of visits to all proposed program sites. Consultations have&#13;
been conducted with the representatives of the local municipality and DMEU.&#13;
B. Present Conditions&#13;
4.    Water supply. Both surface water (70%) and groundwater (30%) resources are exploited for&#13;
drinking water supply. Treated water complies with WHO and EU standards most of the time, and&#13;
quality problems (levels of iron, manganese, aluminum and THMs) are not considered to be a public&#13;
health issue although consumers are dissatisfied with the unpleasant color and odor of the water.&#13;
COD levels exceed EU guidelines for water to be treated to the highest standard. The oldest of the&#13;
two surface water treatment plants dates from 1889 and is in poor physical condition; the design does&#13;
not permit improvement. Chlorinators at both surface water treatment works are in poor condition&#13;
and represent a potential risk. Unsafe storage of large volumes of chlorine also poses a threat to&#13;
surrounding workers and inhabitants and should be addressed.&#13;
5.    At present, pollution incidents upstream of Daugavpils could have significant implications for&#13;
water supply especially as there is no upstream monitoring/warning system on the River Daugava and&#13;
there is no significant storage capacity within the water supply network should a production shutdown&#13;
be necessary as a result of a serious upstream pollution incident. The situation is exacerbated because&#13;
the Daugava is an international river and potential pollution sources exist upstream of Daugavpils in&#13;
Belarus and Russia as well as at Kraslava in Latvia and the Ignalina Nuclear Power Plan in Lithuania.&#13;
Chemical factories situated near the border represent a particular hazard. In November 1990, the&#13;
surface water treatment plants (Gajok 1 and 2) had to be closed for ten days due to a cyanide spill&#13;
(130 tons) in Novopolotsk, Belarus. Low level pollution occurs continuously.&#13;
6.    Leakage in the distribution network is reportedly very low (8%). This has been verified by&#13;
independent field tests and is lower than DMEU internal estimates. Factors explaining the unusually&#13;
low leakage are: limited extent of the "external" distribution pipework at 2.23 m/person (i.e. all that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX D&#13;
Page 2 of 7&#13;
pipework outside of the apartment blocks) due to the concentration of the population in large block&#13;
housing estates; low night pressures; and low relative age of the distribution network.&#13;
7.     Wastewvater Collection and Treatment. The cumulative length of the sewerage system in&#13;
Daugavpils is about 180 km and about 90% of the population is connected to the system. Leakage of&#13;
sewage to the surrounding soil through worn-out sewers is a potential threat to the quality of&#13;
groundwater. The infiltration of groundwater into sewers is significant and has also resulted in&#13;
overflows. Works aimed at the rehabilitation of these sewers should be given high priority to reduce&#13;
excessive hydraulic loads on the treatment plant and to minimize groundwater pollution.&#13;
8.     The Kandavas pumping station is responsible for the delivery of approximately 90% of the&#13;
treatment works' flow. The two pumps were installed in 1963 and one of the pumps cannot run for&#13;
more than two weeks at a time. Both are in need of urgent replacement. Many of the nineteen&#13;
satellite pumping stations are also in poor condition and require rehabilitation or replacement.&#13;
9.     Most of the municipal wastewater of Daugavpils is treated at plants consisting of only&#13;
preliminary and primary treatment with no biological phase in which the reduction of oxygen.-&#13;
consuming materials and of nutrients is poOI The current low level of wastewater treatment is one of&#13;
the major sources of pollution of the River Daugava and also has significant impact on the Gulf of&#13;
Riga. Daugavpils has been identified as one of the three priority pollution "hotspots" in Latvia under&#13;
the Baltic Sea Program.&#13;
10.   Sludge from the settling tanks is collected in two thickeners and taken by tanker for disposal&#13;
on sludge fields at the Krizi landfill site. The sludge treatment process needs to be improved to&#13;
reduce the volume of sludge, increase sludge stability, and develop a strategy for its final disposal and&#13;
utilization.&#13;
C. Elements of the Proposed Project&#13;
11.   A brief description of the proposed water supply and wastewater treatment improvements to&#13;
be carried out under the proposed project in Daugavpils is given below:&#13;
(a)    Water Supply&#13;
(i)    Bulk and block metering. Installation of bulk meters to improve the data on&#13;
network performance and to control water use. Installation of block meters&#13;
will enable more accurate billing for household consumption which is&#13;
currently under-invoiced due to underestimation of billing nonnatives.&#13;
(ii)    Vingri Equipment. To provide critical spare parts to maintain the current&#13;
plant performance for one of two existing groundwater abstraction plants.&#13;
(iii)   Ziemelu Well Field and Treatment Plant. To develop groundwater well field&#13;
to a minimum capacity of 13,000 m' per day with potential for eventual&#13;
expansion up to a maximum of 33,000 m3 per day; to complete pipeline from&#13;
site to main distribution network; and to construct iron removal plant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX D&#13;
Page 3 of 7&#13;
(b)    Wastewater Treatment&#13;
(i)    Rehabilitation of Kandavas Pumping Station. Replacement of pumps to&#13;
increase reliability and minimize the possibility of flooding.&#13;
(ii)   Rehabilitation of Secondary Pumping Stations. Replacement of the most&#13;
dilapidated pumps in the nineteen satellite pumping stations to increase&#13;
reliability and minimize the possibility of flooding.&#13;
(iii)   Rehabilitation of Sewers. Reconstruction of worn-out sewers to limit&#13;
groundwater inflow and to minimize the potential for contamination of&#13;
groundwater by raw wastewater.&#13;
(iv)   Rehabilitation and Extension of Treatment Plant. Upgrading of the treatment&#13;
facilities to include a biological phase for the removal of organics and&#13;
nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen) to meet HELCOM recommendations.&#13;
D. Environmental Impact&#13;
12.   The environmental impact which may result from the proposed water and wastewater&#13;
treatment has been divided into general impacts and specific impacts.&#13;
13.   General Impacts. There will inevitably be some environmental impacts associated with&#13;
construction activities. The magnitude of these impacts will depend on a number of factors including&#13;
proximity of houses, length of construction period, working hours and methods of construction. Such&#13;
impacts from large construction works (e.g., extension to the wastewater treatment works, Ziemelu&#13;
source development and iron removal plant) have the potential to be significant over a two year&#13;
period. In particular such impacts could include: noise and vibration; dust release; possible odor&#13;
release when working on existing sewerage and sewage treatment facilities; pollution of surface or&#13;
underground water due to release/spillage of material from construction sites; disruption of traffic and&#13;
noise pollution associated with transporting construction materials and large items of plant; pollution&#13;
risk and hazard to the health of construction workers if construction is carried out on contaminated&#13;
land (e.g. areas where DMEU sewage sludge has been stored). Visual environmental impacts are&#13;
expected to be mninimal. None of the water or wastewater treatment proposals involve resettlement of&#13;
indigenous people.&#13;
14.   Specific Impacts of Water Supply Component:&#13;
(i)    Bulk and Block Metering, Demand management is expected to result in a&#13;
decrease of water use which would have a positive environmental impact as&#13;
less water would be needed to be abstracted thus saving energy and materials,&#13;
and less wastewater would be produced, thus minimizing the possibility of&#13;
pollution in general and reducing the energy and materials spent on&#13;
wastewater treatment;&#13;
(ii)    Vingri Equipment, Modern equipment is expected to be less energy&#13;
consuming, thus having a positive environmental impact; and&#13;
(iii)   Ziemelu Well Field and Treatment Plant. Improved water quality would have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX D&#13;
Page 4 of 7&#13;
a positive health impact, particularly after full exploitation of Ziemelu which&#13;
will enable complete transition away from surface water to groundwater. The&#13;
reduction in the dependency upon the River Daugava affords the consumers of&#13;
drinking water a greater level of protection from the negative health effects&#13;
associated with a sudden deterioration in the river water quality caused by&#13;
upstream pollution. The proposed phased implementation of the wellfield&#13;
development will be accompanied by monitoring of adjacent groundwater&#13;
levels. Any impacts on local river flows or wetland ecology will thus be&#13;
observed sufficiently early so that mitigation measures can be introduced to&#13;
counter any negative effects. Construction of the pipeline, groundwater wells&#13;
and access roads will require only limited tree clearing as the site has already&#13;
been partially developed. Land take associated with establishment of iron&#13;
removal facilities at Jauna Forstate and the new pipeline is not considered to&#13;
be significant, however ecological site inventories will be undertaken before&#13;
final site selection is agreed. Noise is not likely to be a significant issue given&#13;
experience with other similar facilities. Iron removal facilities will generate&#13;
some sludge but this is estimated to be minor in comparison with that from&#13;
the waste water treatment plant. As for the wastewater sludge, a suitable&#13;
management strategy will be developed for the water treatment works' sludge.&#13;
This strategy will be incorporated into the scope of the technical assistance for&#13;
the detailed design of the iron removal plant.&#13;
(iv)   The groundwater source to be utilized is, however, potentially vulnerable to&#13;
pollution from two contaminated areas: a former dump for municipal solid&#13;
waste in Krizi, located about 2 lkn south-east of Ziemelu, and an old military&#13;
oil depot about 3.5 km north-east of Ziemelu. These have been studied and&#13;
have been found to pose no threat to area groundwater supplies for at least a&#13;
thirty year period. However, further monitoring and groundwater modelling&#13;
will be required to ensure that any potential risks are detected early enough to&#13;
allow for prompt mitigation in order to protect the wellfield over the longer&#13;
term. Funding for these investigations are included in the financing estimates&#13;
for the project. The City of Daugavpils has agreed to repair the cover over&#13;
the closed Krizi landfill which will further protect against any future threat of&#13;
contamination. Appropriate wellhead protection zoning will be incorporated&#13;
into the wellfield design and will ensure that the groundwater quality is not&#13;
compromised by surface contamination.&#13;
15.   Specific Impacts of Wastewater Treatment Component:&#13;
(i)    Rehabilitation of Pumping Stations. Upgrading of pumping stations will&#13;
improve efficiency thus saving energy and reduce costs; more reliable pumps&#13;
will minimize the risk of malfunction and possible consequent environmental&#13;
contamination from overflowing sewage pumping stations.&#13;
(ii)    Rehabilitation of Sewers. Rehabilitation of sewers will reduce groundwater&#13;
pollution and infiltration thus reducing the amount of water to be pumped as&#13;
well as reducing the possibility of flooding.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX D&#13;
Page 5 of 7&#13;
(iii)   Rehabilitation and Extension of Wastewater Treatment Plant.&#13;
Extension/upgrading of the Daugavpils wastewater treatment plant will&#13;
improve effluent quality and thus enhance the physicochemical and&#13;
microbiological quality of the River Daugava, the Riga Bay and river bathing&#13;
beaches in the discharge area. During the feasibility study and environmental&#13;
review, the option of constructing an entirely new facility at a separate&#13;
location was reviewed but was found not to be financially feasible or&#13;
justifiable. Industrial pre-treatment has been evaluated through sampling&#13;
during the feasibility study and found to be sufficient to enable biological&#13;
treatment of wastewater. The introduction of a wastewater influent&#13;
monitoring system will be included to ensure that any abnormal influent&#13;
industrial discharges are identified early and diverted so that they do not&#13;
poison the biological treatment phase. A complete sludge strategy will be&#13;
included in the scope of the technical assistance for the detailed design of the&#13;
wastewater treatment plant. The upgraded wastewater plant will include&#13;
mechanical dewatering equipment for the reduction of the sludge volume.&#13;
Such reduction in volume will also reduce environmental impacts arising from&#13;
transportation of sludge. After dewatering, the sludge will be treated by&#13;
either lime stabilization or composting. The strategy will identify the most&#13;
suitable and environmentally acceptable final disposal/reuse route for the&#13;
treated sludge.&#13;
16.   Proposed Mitigation Plan. The overall aim of the project is to undertake measures which will&#13;
improve the water supply and wastewater services of Daugavpils. The major environmental impacts&#13;
of the project will therefore be beneficial in improving the health and quality of life of the city's&#13;
population. Further positive impacts will result from the improvement in water quality in the River&#13;
Daugava and Riga Bay. The impact of construction will primarily affect the human population and&#13;
will be largely limited to relatively minor disruption and disturbance. It would be possible to reduce&#13;
the extent of this inconvenience by implementing regular construction site practices and procedures.&#13;
17.   Although the expected impacts of the project are positive, actions by DMEU will be required&#13;
to: (i) monitor raw and treated water quality; (ii) monitor industrial wastewater discharges; (iii)&#13;
improve sludge management; and (iv) monitor receiving water quality. These measures are discussed&#13;
below.&#13;
18.   Water Quality Monitoring. The monitoring of water quality at the source and after treatment&#13;
is carried out by the utility. The required analyses are set by law and consist of more than twenty&#13;
parameters. The Ministry of Welfare, through its Environment Health Centers, are supervising the&#13;
performance of the monitoring and carrying out control measurements (after treatment) about once&#13;
every month and additionally at household taps on a random basis. The list of monitored parameters&#13;
do not cover certain toxic parameters which could have an impact on human health. A recent United&#13;
States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) study (financed by United States Agency for&#13;
International Development) has recommended the expansion of the list. The Ministry of Health and&#13;
MOERD are currently considering the review of the monitoring requirements. As soon as the new&#13;
recommendations are adopted they should be incorporated into the water quality monitoring program&#13;
at Daugavpils.&#13;
19.   The new groundwater field at Ziemelu provides an important opportunity to improve drinking&#13;
water quality in Daugavpils. However as mentioned above, the source is potentially vulnerable to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX D&#13;
Page 6 of 7&#13;
pollution from two sources, the former municipal solid waste dump at Krizi and the former military&#13;
oil depot. Utilization of the Ziemelu wellfield will alter groundwater flows and is expected to divert&#13;
the contaminated plumes towards Ziemelu. Additional wells will be drilled to allow for the monitoring&#13;
of the aforementioned pollution sources as the phased development of the wellfield proceeds.&#13;
20.    A wellhead protection program has been put into place with the assistance of the US EPA.&#13;
However there is, at present, no legislation to protect the recharge area of Ziemelu groundwater&#13;
wellfield from potentially polluting activities or to restrict the patterns of land use in the area. The&#13;
situation is expected to improve since the Law on Protected Areas is currently being discussed in the&#13;
Parliament and is expected to be passed soon. Nevertheless, certain activities in the recharge area&#13;
(such as the installation of subterranean oil tanks or the quarrying of sand) currently require permits&#13;
from the MOERD and would not be granted on the protected zones already established around&#13;
Ziemelu welifield.&#13;
21.    Wastewater Monitoring. According to current legislation, the water utility is responsible for&#13;
monitoring the wastewater quality in the collection network, in the treatment plant and after treatment.&#13;
The list of parameters that are monitored consists of about 20 compounds. The utility is also&#13;
responsible for monitoring the wastewaters discharged by those industries which are connected to the&#13;
public sewerage system. The Daugavpils Regional Environmental Protection Committee oversees&#13;
DMEU's monitoring program by taking their own samples and analyzing them at their own&#13;
laboratory. Although the list of parameters for the monitoring of industrial wastes is extensive, the&#13;
US EPA study has proposed to include some additional toxins, which potentially can accumulate in&#13;
fish and in the sediments of receiving waters.&#13;
22.    Due to the decline in industrial activity in Daugavpils, the problem of heavy metals in the&#13;
wastewater is no longer considered to be a problem. The monitoring/regulating system, however, was&#13;
not able to prevent the discharge of excessive industrial loads as the pollution fees were far too low to&#13;
be a deterrent to the industries. The monitoring/regulating system has mainly been used to collect the&#13;
associated pollution fees from contravening industries rather than improve the quality of the industrial&#13;
effluent that is discharged to the municipal sewers. Under this project, with the introduction of&#13;
biological treatment at the wastewater works, illicit discharges must be more closely monitored and&#13;
controlled to provide a barrier against the failure of the plant's biological phase. A review of the&#13;
current industrial discharge permitting system, and recommendation for its improvement, will be&#13;
included in the technical assistance for the design of the wastewater treatment plant. A wastewater&#13;
influent monitoring system will also be included in the design of the treatment works which will&#13;
ensure that any influent toxic slugs are diverted so that the biological treatment phase is not poisoned&#13;
by sudden, excessive, toxic polluting incidents.&#13;
23.    Sludge Management. The quality of the sludge produced at the wastewater treatment works is&#13;
not regularly monitored. Some studies indicate that the levels of heavy metals have decreased, along&#13;
with the aforementioned decline in industrial activity in Daugavpils, to levels which would allow the&#13;
safe reuse of the stabilized sludge on agricultural land. According to the utility, local farmers are not&#13;
interested in using the wastewater sludge on their fields due to the fear of, inter alia, industrial&#13;
contaminants and odor release. Currently sludge is dried on dedicated fields which are located&#13;
adjacent to Krizi dump. The desiccated sludge, following a 1-2 year drying period, is used as cover&#13;
material for both the old and the new landfills.&#13;
24.    The upgrading of the existing wastewater treatment plant will include mechanical dewatering&#13;
equipment for the sludge that will allow its dry solids content to be increased to about 20-25 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX D&#13;
Page 7 of 7&#13;
Two options for stabilizing the dewatered sludge were investigated during the feasibility study:&#13;
(i) lime stabilization; and (ii) composting with peat and sand. Preliminary calculations showed the&#13;
lime stabilization to be the cheaper option. A final decision on the method of sludge stabilization will&#13;
be made during the detailed design phase. There is also a clear need to launch a public information/&#13;
education campaign with the local farmers in order to inform them of the benefits of the stabilized&#13;
sludge as a safe fertilizer and soil conditioner. Currently Latvia does not have any regulations&#13;
concerning the reuse of sludge in agriculture. It is, however, expected that before the wastewater&#13;
treatment plant is commissioned, preliminary national guidelines will be available. These issues,&#13;
related to the final disposal of sludge, will be incorporated into the scope of the technical assistance&#13;
for the detailed design of the wastewater treatment plant.&#13;
25.   Although the configuration of the upgraded wastewater treatment plant will only be defined&#13;
following the detailed design stage, the following approximate estimates have been produced&#13;
(assuming the incorporation of primary sedimentation tanks) as to the anticipated volume and solids&#13;
content that the plant will generate: (i) primary sludge, 5 tons per day at 3% dry solids; and&#13;
(ii) secondary sludge, 5 tons per day at 1 % dry solids. Assuming both sludges will be co-thickened in&#13;
the sludge thickeners, then 250 m3 of thickened sludge, at 5 % dry solids, will be produced daily,&#13;
which will be dewatered to produce 50 m3 of sludge at 20% dry solids each day.&#13;
26.   Monitoring of Receiving Water Ouality. The monitoring of water quality in receiving waters&#13;
is the responsibility of the Hydrometereological Agency. Currently the Agency is taking monthly&#13;
samples upstream and downstream of Daugavpils. The list of parameters which are monitored&#13;
monthly is extensive. Regional committees also carry out some monitoring of surface waters, but this&#13;
is less comprehensive. The aforementioned US EPA study recommended that some additional&#13;
parameters (organic chemicals) be included in the surface water monitoring list.&#13;
27.   It is proposed that data on surface water quality be collected prior to the commissioning of the&#13;
upgraded treatment plant. This information would be used as a baseline against which the anticipated&#13;
improvement of the River Daugava's water quality would be measured. Such a monitoring program&#13;
would involve the analysis of water samples from various points along the river. Ideally, baseline data&#13;
collection would commence a year before the plant is commissioned.&#13;
E. Agreed Actions&#13;
28.   It was agreed that DMEU would, with the assistance of the MOERD and the Daugavpils&#13;
Regional Environmental Protection Committee, submit a plan to address these issues no later than&#13;
January, 31, 1996. Such plan would be discussed and agreed with the Bank. DMEU will be&#13;
required to implement this plan and to take other such actions with regard to environmental&#13;
monitoring and mitigation as may reasonably be required by the Bank.&#13;

RIGA URBAN TRANSPORT COMPONENT&#13;
ENVIRONMENTAL ASPECTS&#13;
A. Overview&#13;
1.    The implementation of the proposed project would have a positive environmental impact&#13;
through improvements that will increase use of public transport and limit the pace of growth use in&#13;
private auto transport. The project will also have a direct impact through reduced emissions and&#13;
reduced fuel consumption due to upgrading of the public transport fleet and to improved maintenance.&#13;
2.    An environmental review was prepared by the Dutch consultancy DHV in association with&#13;
Holland Transport Advising. The review is consistent with the requirement of the World Bank for a&#13;
category B project and complies with the Latvian Law on Environmental Impact Assessment.&#13;
B. Present Situation&#13;
3.    In the past few years the noise levels in Riga have increased due to an increase in transport&#13;
flows, bad road conditions and a decrease in technical conditions of most vehicles. Observations made&#13;
by the Environmental Health Dept., the Ministry of Welfare, in 1994, showed that, on main roads,&#13;
the actual noise levels are exceeding the standards (70 dB(A) during day time, 60 dB(A) during night&#13;
time) by between 10 to 20 dB(A). These standards were set in Soviet times.&#13;
4.    Vehicles are currently subject to annual roadworthy tests which would ensure that particularly&#13;
noisy buses would be kept off the road. A Law on Environmental Protection is currently being&#13;
discussed in the Latvian Parliament, although it is believed that this will have limited powers with&#13;
respect to abnormal noise levels. Enforcement of proposed regulations regarding noise are to become&#13;
the responsibility of the Municipality.&#13;
5.    The total emissions of NO,, CO and hydrocarbons for transport and stationary sources (boiler&#13;
houses - which produce hot water for apartments and factories, industrial sources etc.), for Latvia as&#13;
a whole, in 1993, are given below in Table 6.1. Air quality measurements have been undertaken in&#13;
the City of Riga. It has been agreed that the city would prepare an annual report on air quality.&#13;
Some typical concentrations measured in streets with heavy traffic are given below in Table 6.2. It&#13;
can be observed that the air quality standard with respect to NO,, is exceeded in streets with heavy&#13;
traffic in Riga. Generally, new cars are less polluting than old cars.&#13;

6.     Random vehicle testing, undertaken by Riga Technical University, on buses with both diesel&#13;
and petrol engines, indicated that smoke emission was high, due to bad regulation of engines. The&#13;
University stated that, on average, 40% of existing buses tested failed the emissions check. The&#13;
RBMST now subjects buses operated by the three Riga public transport companies to regular&#13;
emissions testing every quarter. Failed vehicles are kept out of service until repairs can be made.&#13;
These requirements will be expanded to include all privately licensed buses. Specifications for fuel&#13;
used by the three Riga public transport companies comply with European standards.&#13;
C. Environmental Impacts of the Proposed Project&#13;
7.     Tramns. As a consequence of the proposed investment in converting 60 trams to thyristor&#13;
chopper control, the energy consumption will be reduced (calculated reduction of approximately 4375&#13;
MWh per annum). This reduction in energy consumption will lead to a slight reduction in air&#13;
pollution from electric power plants. This reduction, however, will not be of any influence on air&#13;
quality in the city of Riga. Good and preventive maintenance leads to a reduction of noise nuisance.&#13;
Technical assistance to be provided, to improve maintenance procedures, will have an impact in this&#13;
area.&#13;
8.     Trolleybuses. It is proposed to renew part of the fleet (30 trolleybuses). As a consequence, it&#13;
is calculated that energy consumption will reduce by approximately 1984 MWh per annum. This&#13;
reduction in energy consumption will lead to a slight reduction in air pollution from electric power&#13;
plants. This reduction, however, will not be of any influence on air quality in the city of Riga.&#13;
9.     Buses. It is proposed to renew part of the fleet (36 buses). New buses are less noisy and less&#13;
polluting than old buses. Some emission factors for (Dutch) buses built in the year of 1970, 1980 and&#13;
1990 are given below in Table 6.3. Emission factors of, for example, Ikarus buses will probably not&#13;
be totally comparable, although it may be considered that, for engines of these type of buses, more&#13;
modern techniques will reduce the volumes of pollution, with respect to CO, hydrocarbons and&#13;
particles. The newer buses to be purchased will be supplied with engines of the Euro II specification,&#13;
which are much less polluting than existing buses. It should also be noted that the Danish consulting&#13;
firm, RH&amp;H, will undertake a demonstration project in Latvia to indicate where reductions in&#13;
emissions can be made.&#13;

Good maintenance and engine regulation will minimise air pollution and noise. Technical assistance to&#13;
be provided, to improve maintenance procedures, will have an impact in this area.&#13;
10.    Wider impact. The proposed investments will assist in reversing the trend towards greater use&#13;
of private cars and is an important environment consideration. Table 6.3 details emission factors, with&#13;
respect to cars and buses. The information is based on data from the Netherlands.&#13;

11.    The use of 25 to 50 cars, instead of one bus, will result in much higher total emissions of CO&#13;
and hydrocarbons. The total emissions of NO, and particles are comparable. Noise levels generated&#13;
by 25/50 cars will also be higher than that produced by one bus.&#13;
12.    A further consequence of greater car use, instead of public transport, will be increases in&#13;
traffic volumes, with average vehicles speeds decreasing. This will result in more stops and increasing&#13;
accelerations, with subsequently higher emissions of all components and higher noise levels.&#13;

LATVIA&#13;
MUNICIPAL SERVICES DEVELOPMENT PROJECT&#13;
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS&#13;
A. Riga Urban Transport&#13;
1.    Project Benefits. The proposed project would have significant economic benefits related to:&#13;
(a) reduced vehicle operating costs; and (b) passenger time savings. These benefits have been&#13;
calculated by comparing the "with" and "without" project scenarios. The assumptions used in this&#13;
analysis are further defined below.&#13;
(a)    Reduced vehicle operating costs. The state of equipment in the Riga public transport&#13;
companies has deteriorated significantly over the last five years given the lack of&#13;
investment in new equipment, maintenance and spare parts. The reduction in spares&#13;
budget has forced the companies into cannibalization of vehicles. Over time this&#13;
raises the cost of operating vehicles given the increasing number of breakdowns,&#13;
increased expenditure on maintenance, lower capacity utilization and increased fuel&#13;
consumption. Extensive corrosion of vehicles reduces structural integrity and&#13;
requires capital repairs to steel body works. Purchase of new vehicles, spare parts&#13;
inventories and maintenance equipment in combination with actions to retire the least&#13;
serviceable vehicles will enable a substantial reduction in maintenance costs (staff and&#13;
spare parts) and will reduce expenditures for fuel and energy.&#13;
The extent of these savings has been modelled for each individual measure based on&#13;
the assumption that costs would continue to increase at an average rate of 1 % per year&#13;
without the project. With the project, it is assumed that costs would fall initially by&#13;
10%. Costs for both scenarios are estimated in 1995 constant lats and have been&#13;
adjusted to remove taxes and to compensate for differences in prices. The most&#13;
significant adjustments are to: (i) increase the cost of electricity prices which have&#13;
been revalued to the external purchase price (roughly twice the current price paid by&#13;
the transport companies); and (ii) to remove the impact of the turnover tax (18%).&#13;
The government operates a floating exchange rate, with respect to the lat, and,&#13;
therefore, prices do not have to be adjusted in this respect.&#13;
Vehicle life is estimated at 12 years for buses and 15 years for trolleybuses.&#13;
Investments in tram thyristor chopper traction control systems are estimated to yield&#13;
benefits for 12 years given expected useful remaining life of the upgraded vehicles.&#13;
(b)    Passenger waitine time. Time savings are realized through a decrease in breakdowns&#13;
and vehicle availability, with an assumed passenger time loss of 5 minutes per&#13;
incident. The proposed investments in spare parts, machinery and training plus the&#13;
increased reliability of the new vehicles will improve the quality of the service&#13;
offered. In the "without project case," an annual increase in the number of&#13;
breakdowns and trips not operated was assumed to increase by 2% per annum. In the&#13;
"with project case," there is an initial decrease in breakdowns and trips not operated&#13;
by 90% and a further annual decrease of 1 % per annum due to better training and&#13;
additional new vehicle purchases. Non-work time was valued at 40% of work time.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX F&#13;
Page 2 of 5&#13;
The monthly wage was assumed to be 150 lats (significantly above the national&#13;
average) to account for the higher Riga incomes.&#13;
(c)    Terminal value. No terminal value has been assumed.&#13;
(d)    Additional benefits. Additional benefits resulting from the proposed investment were&#13;
not readily quantifiable and were not included in the analysis. These include:&#13;
reductions in vehicle congesion, increase in passenger mobility and improvement in&#13;
city image. This analysis also does not include any benefits due to the rationalization&#13;
of the network following completion of the passenger study.&#13;
2.    Project Costs. Costs used for estimating the economic rate of return are the total project costs&#13;
of the Bank project between 1996 and 2000 and additional investments made by the public transport&#13;
enterprises out of own source revenues to the year 2007. Estimates of local and foreign costs are in&#13;
1995 prices. Costs exclude price contingencies as these involve only inflation. No physical&#13;
contingencies are assumed on equipment purchases. Physical contingencies of 10% have been&#13;
assumed on civil works. As the portion of civil works in the sub-project are very small, this has little&#13;
impact. Local costs have been converted to US dollar equivalent using prevailing exchange rates.&#13;
3.    Economic Rate of Return. The economic rate of return was calculated by comparing the costs&#13;
and benefits of the two scenarios: "with project" and "without project." The economic rate of return&#13;
is 22%. Benefits due to passenger time savings are a small proportion of total project benefits (5%).&#13;
The net present value is US$8.8 million. A discount rate of 10% was used in calculating the net&#13;
present value. These calculations are shown in Table F-1.&#13;
4.    A sensitivity analysis was conducted to measure the impact of variations in costs and benefits&#13;
on the economic rate of return. The sensitivity was measured by calculating the switching values (the&#13;
extent to which costs or benefits would have to change to reduce the economic rate to 12%). Project&#13;
costs could be increased by a factor of 1.38 or project benefits reduced by a factor of .72 and the&#13;
economic rate of return would still remain at 12%. The impact of a potential devaluation of the&#13;
currency would be to an increase in project costs and a partial increase in project benefits. The&#13;
project would be able to maintain a 12% economic rate of return with a devaluation of 40%.&#13;
B. Daugavpils Water and Waste Water&#13;
5.    Project Benefits. The proposed project would have the following benefits: (a) public health&#13;
impacts from improved drinking water safety and quality; and (b) reduced discharge of untreated or&#13;
partially treated waste water to the River Daugava. An economic rate of return could not be&#13;
calculated as the benefits from both components are not easily quantifiable. Instead, a least cost&#13;
analysis of alternatives was conducted.&#13;
(a)    Improved drinking water safety and quality. Construction of a new groundwater&#13;
wellfield will enable diversification of water supplies and provide a basis for complete&#13;
movement away from surface water. Daugavpils is downstream from several major&#13;
chemical factories in Belarus and there have been several accidents involving&#13;
discharge of toxic chemicals into the river. In November 1990, 130 tons of cyanide&#13;
were discharged into the water and all surface water intakes in Daugavpils had to be&#13;
turned off for a period of 10 days. Daugavpils is also within close proximity to oil&#13;
storage facilities at Kraslava and the Ignalina nuclear power plant in Lithuania.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
ANNEX F&#13;
Page 3 of 5&#13;
Diversification of water supply is expected to have significant positive public health&#13;
benefits and would reduce costs associated with provision of alternative water supply&#13;
during water emergencies.&#13;
Increased use of groundwater will also improve water quality. Iron, manganese,&#13;
aluminum, oxydizability and THM are higher than EU standards. While the iron and&#13;
other metals are mainly and aesthetic concern, the THMs are carcinogenic&#13;
compounds. Although they are common in most of the systems using raw water with&#13;
a high organic content, and the relation of cancer and THMs in drinking water is&#13;
difficult to prove, the general tendency is to move away from using contaminated or&#13;
otherwise high organic content surface waters to groundwater use or to use activated&#13;
carbon filters in combination with ozonation instead of chlorination.&#13;
The value of these benefits do not lend themselves to quantification, although it can be&#13;
reasonably assumed that the benefits are significant given the potential positive impact&#13;
on public health and the physical environment. Instead, a least cost analysis of&#13;
alternatives was conducted comparing transition to groundwater with use of activated&#13;
carbon filters and ozonation. The fixed investment costs of both alternatives was&#13;
comparable; however, the operating costs of upgrading the surface water treatment&#13;
works would be 25 % higher given the higher chemical costs. In addition, upgrading&#13;
the surface water treatment works would result in the city's continued vulnerability to&#13;
oil spills and accidental release of toxic chemicals. These risks could be mitigated at&#13;
further expense by increasing reservoir capacity and improving on early warning&#13;
systems; however, such measures could not eliminate these risks entirely.&#13;
(b)    Environmental benefits from improved waste water treatment. Daugavpils is one of&#13;
the priority "hotspots" under the Baltic Sea Program. Waste water receives only&#13;
preliminary and primary treatment, and the reduction of BOD and nutrients is poor.&#13;
This has a significant impact on the River Daugava, the Riga Bay and the Baltic Sea.&#13;
Under the project, the waste water treatment plant will be rehabilitated and a&#13;
biological treatment phase added. This will result in significant reductions in BOD&#13;
and nutrients. See Table F-2.&#13;
It is assumed that the local benefits of improved waste water treatment (recreational&#13;
value from improvement to local beaches and fishing) are captured in the above&#13;
estimation of benefits for the water supply component. Similarly, it is assumed that&#13;
local benefits of improvements to the sewage pumping stations and gravity sewers&#13;
have been captured in the above estimation of benefitis for the water supply&#13;
component. The positive externalities associated with improved water quality&#13;
downstream of Daugavpils, in Riga Bay and in the Baltic Sea are not easily&#13;
quantifiable. A least cost analysis of the alternatives has been conducted including&#13;
assessment of feasibility of constructing a new wastewater treatment works at a new&#13;
location which would allow increased space needed to allow for longer retention&#13;
times. This option was found not to be cost effective. Similarly, use of biofiltration&#13;
was examined and was not found to be cost effective.&#13;

C. Municipal Development Fund&#13;
6.    Projects selected for financing under the Municipal Development Fund must demonstrate a&#13;
minimum economic rate of return of 12%. The average is estimated to be 15% but will depend very&#13;
much on the distribution of projects among sectors and the extent to which benefits lend themselves to&#13;
quanitification.&#13;

            The Municipal Services Development
            Project aims to support the extensive decentralization and
            intergovernmental fiscal reforms already instituted by the
            government by providing access to investment financing and
            technical assistance needed for rehabilitation and improved
            management of municipal services. The project has the
            following specific objectives: 1) improve efficiency and
            quality of public transport services in Riga, improve the
            financial condition and promote further corporatization in
            the three Riga public transport companies; 2) improve the
            quality of drinking water in Daugavpils, reduce discharge of
            untreated and partially treated wastewaters to the Daugave
            River and Baltic Sea, improve the financial management and
            promote further corporatization of the Daugavpils water
            utility; and 3) pursue similar objectives in other
            communities through financing of the Municipal Development
            Fund. This project consists of three main components: 1)
            Riga urban transport, which includes the following
            sub-components: (a) new buses; (b) new trolleybuses; (c)
            tram electrical equipment; (d) capital repair programs; (e)
            spare parts; (f) relocation of Imanta workshop; (g) workshop
            plant and equipment; and (h) training and technical
            assistance; 2) Daugavpils water and wastewater treatment
            including: (a) development of Ziemelu Wellfield; (b)
            rehabilitation of the existing wastewater treatment plant;
            (c) rehabilitation of pumping stations; (d) metering; (e)
            monitoring; (f) institutional strengthening and twinning;
