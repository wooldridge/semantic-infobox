     THE CHAIRMAN:          Thank you, sil'o&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
         Now can we go back to the Japanese loan.      I   would like&#13;
first to calIon Mr. Kheradjou.&#13;
&#13;
         MR .. KHERADJOU:    Mr. Chairman, gentlemen, when the $40         I&#13;
&#13;
                                                                           I&#13;
million loan for the expressway was presented here last              March~&#13;
                                                                           !&#13;
we reported that as far as the Japanese steel industry was&#13;
concerned the Bank had ad vlsed them that, in the fut ure, it&#13;
~rould    consider only very modest loans as part of a combined&#13;
operation.       At that time Kawasaki and Sumitomo had already&#13;
discussed through their bankers, placement of their notes&#13;
wtth inst Itut ional 1rlvestors in the United states           $4&#13;
million to $5 million for Kawasaki and $5 million to&#13;
$7.5 mIllion for Sumttomoe          The raising of loans by the&#13;
&amp;#12;    ; Japanese private companies was never considered an easy task&#13;
"&#13;
    ! but   the students' demonstrations, which were interpreted by&#13;
&#13;
i the&#13;
.J&#13;
&#13;
             foreign investors as a threat to political stability in&#13;
    !&#13;
II       Japan, upset the work of months of negotiations with U. S.&#13;
ii&#13;
"&#13;
&#13;
:\ investors, just at the pOint where it seemed these would be&#13;
    I&#13;
    ! successfully concluded.            In fact, discussions had gone so&#13;
&#13;
         far that the investors agreed not to withdraw from the deals&#13;
         but to await a calmer political atmosphere which was expected&#13;
&#13;
         to prevail after the general elections.           The bankers could,&#13;
&#13;
         however, obtain a tentative promise, subject to the clearing&#13;
&#13;
         of the political atmosphere, for the placement of $4 million&#13;
&#13;
         of Kawasaki notes and, this annunt, only when the Bank agreed&#13;
&#13;
         to lend $6 million to make up the initially needed amount&#13;
&#13;
         for the project.         Sumitomo, for which it was planned to raise       !&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    'i   $7-1/2 million, managed to place some $5 million of its notes&#13;
&#13;
     'with the same provision, and the Bank agreed to consider a&#13;
&#13;
         loan of   07   million.     After the President's report was distriÂ­&#13;
&#13;
    , buted we were informed that purchasers have now been found&#13;
&#13;
     : for $5,8 million of Sumitomo notes which, with this loan, if&#13;
&#13;
    :' approved, and with the          ~600,OOO   3-year loan to be borrowed&#13;
&#13;
         from I',lanufactures Trust, make the total amount of funds raised&#13;
&#13;
         by Sumitomo     ~p13.4   million.   The interest on the I'.'ianufactures&#13;
&#13;
         Trust loan has been reported as 6-1/2% in the President's&#13;
&#13;
         report but we have since learned that this rate has been under&#13;
&#13;
         negotiation and will be 5-3/4%.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     16&#13;
&#13;
        The hard work and perseverance against odds shown by&#13;
&#13;
. the officers of these companies in their pioneering \'lOrk of&#13;
&#13;
 raising loans abroad without involving Government credit may&#13;
&#13;
, be considered another facet of the excellent management they&#13;
&#13;
 enjoy.&#13;
&#13;
        Since the Bank urged the Japanese steel industry to tap&#13;
&#13;
, private capital markets abroad, quite a number of Japanese&#13;
&#13;
 companies have tried or made plans to raise funds on their&#13;
&#13;
 own.     Kobe Steel Works, one of the companies for which the&#13;
&#13;
 Bank had made a loan of        ;,~lO   million in 1958, was fortunate&#13;
&#13;
 in obtaining    ;i~30   million from the Prudential Insurance&#13;
&#13;
 Company of America in June just before the Toyko disturbances&#13;
&#13;
 had caused nervousness.         v'le were glad to do all we could to&#13;
&#13;
 help Kobe carry out that operation. The loan l"hi ch was&#13;
&#13;
 guaranteed by a number of the largest private banks in Japan&#13;
&#13;
 wa.s for a term of 15 years with           7%   interest.&#13;
&#13;
        Japan obviously needs foreign capital for its extraÂ­&#13;
&#13;
 ordinarily high pace of development, and Japanese private 
&#13;
&#13;
 companies are active in trying to attract this capital. 
&#13;
&#13;
 HOl'leVer, the difficulties encounter ed over the past year 
&#13;
&#13;
 showed two things:         One, raising of capital by way of loan 
&#13;
&#13;
 is at least as difficult as it was thought by the Bank, 
&#13;
&#13;
 especially when some equity feature is not included; tvlO, 
&#13;
&#13;
 the direct or indirect support of the Bank for awhile yet 
&#13;
                    '1/'&#13;
 is considered    of~reat     importance by many investors for&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        17 
&#13;
&#13;
'Japan to raise long-term capital.&#13;
                These two Bank loans are proposed for good projects of&#13;
&#13;
         high developmental priority and for two very well run&#13;
&#13;
I        companies with whom we have enjoyed excellent relations for&#13;
,&#13;
: some years.           The servicing of these loans would obviously&#13;
&#13;
         present no problem either for the companies or for .Japan.&#13;
&#13;
                With these two loans total lending, since Mr. Black's&#13;
&#13;
         1957 visit to Japan when the active phase of our operations&#13;
&#13;
         in Japan began, would amount to ~271 million of which ~~140&#13;
         million has been for steel, $101 million for power and $40&#13;
    :,&#13;
     'million for a highway.       So even before the $300 million&#13;
&#13;
         lending program discussed by l':'ir. Black was exhausted, it was&#13;
    'ifelt that the turnof fortune had made Japan's credit so good,&#13;
&#13;
         at least on any showing of economic growth and balance of&#13;
&#13;
         payments and reserves position, that a weaning process should&#13;
&#13;
         start and Bank loans should be used to help establish the&#13;
&#13;
         credit, both of the GoverlU'Tlent and of the private corporations,!&#13;
&#13;
         ,in the private capital markets.     This is one reason why&#13;
&#13;
    :iconsideration of a loan for the Japanese National Railways&#13;
&#13;
         was made conditional on a market operation for a Government&#13;
&#13;
         :project either prior to our loan or simultaneously.     The&#13;
&#13;
         Railway Project, the New Tokaido Line, was presented to the&#13;
         Bank as the basis of a   ~100   million loan nearly two years&#13;
         ago.    As mentioned in our last loan presentation public&#13;
         transport has been a conspicuously neglected sector of the&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                       18&#13;

&#13;
         flncl or taken less time to prepare.                  A rat:wa:' loan would&#13;

'I&#13;

         the time comes, to take a falrl,l substantial amonnt of bondS&#13;

         of a Government -SUppo!'ted corporat ton, and theX'efore any&#13;
&#13;

&#13;

&#13;

&#13;
         J~apanese    for poss ible loans ,one for Kyush u power ($12&#13;
&#13;
         million), and the other for Tokyo Gas of which the conÂ­&#13;
&#13;
         s tderat ton of the first one is far adv::tnced.               Kyushu power&#13;
&#13;
         was ftrst pl'esented at the end of 1958.                  It was not conÂ­&#13;
         stdered sooner because the financial position of Kyushu and&#13;
&#13;
         l.ts ability to finance its vast expansion program oepended&#13;
&#13;
         so much on Goverr.t.l1lent permitt tl'g some rate increase.             Th 1s&#13;

             THE CHAIHi.J[AN:     Thank 'you.          Mr. TolleJ'.&#13;
&#13;
             MEL TOLL'SY:       Mr. Chai.!'man, gentlemen, the long-term&#13;
&#13;
economIc target of the                ne~l    Government in Japan is to more&#13;
&#13;
than double the gross national product within the next&#13;
&#13;
lOÂ·Â·years--that is, all average increase of over                              7% per year.&#13;
For the short-run, the target !.S an increase of                                30%    in GNP&#13;
&#13;
durtng the next th;?ee years 1 or an a verage                         L~ate     of    9% pel"&#13;
year.          These rates of       gro~lth 8. re       much higher than the&#13;
&#13;
off1.cla 1 project lons or targets adopted by previous go 'JernÂ­&#13;
&#13;
ments.          However, the official projections tn the past have&#13;
&#13;
proven to be too Jow 1 and the new GNP targets represent&#13;
&#13;
growth rates which the GOVernment 1 after care ful study,&#13;
&#13;
considers to be feasible and realistic.                            The new goals are&#13;
    ft1:1.&#13;
fa~J.Y         closely tn line wtth actual growth r.ates of the past&#13;
&#13;
decade" and they carta inly do not a{:.Â·pear too high tn&#13;
&#13;
comparison with the results of the last year or tlllo--Le.,&#13;
&#13;
the remarkable            17% increase in GNP tn 1959 and the estimated&#13;
10% to 11% increase in the current                        ~tear.&#13;
&#13;
             T:!1.e bas Ic reasons lmderlying the adopt lon of these&#13;
&#13;
targets are first to provtde employment i"or the rapld1y&#13;
&#13;
growtne labor force; second to reduce nnderemployment; and&#13;
thtrd tr:&gt; raise per capita income.                       The latter      1.8    still&#13;

countries.            If the above targets are achieved, it ts&#13;
&#13;
estimated that JCl.pan's per ce.pita lncome a.nd standard of&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
             Whlle the targets do not             appea~      unreasonable, they&#13;
w'!ll not be easy to reach.                     As described in past reports ..&#13;

             THE CHAIR1'IlAN:           Before I ask for any questions .. these&#13;
        tw:) loans are a rather unusual projeot for the Bank.                   This&#13;
        1s the first time where we have made loaps together with&#13;
        insurance companies for private placement.                     As you know, 1n&#13;
        the normal loan we make the Banks take the short maturities,&#13;
        and we have had a number of                 trar~actions   where we have taken&#13;
        part of a loan and the other part has been floated with the&#13;
        general public through SEC registration.                   Now, this did not&#13;
        require SEC registrat ion"              This was mere l~r a prl vate placeÂ­&#13;
                                                                                          i&#13;
        ment with a group of rrainly insurance companies, but they                     wer~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
        long-term paper.&#13;
             we         were anxious to help to establish this type of&#13;
"&#13;
    ,&#13;
        operation.             This was a new t)peration for the Bank.        The&#13;
        'interest rate paid by the steel companies for the money from&#13;
    i&#13;
    , the   iI'l...8   urance companies, the longer term money, wes 7-1/2&#13;
        percent, in both cases. 
&#13;
             Are there any questions? 
&#13;
                MRo LIEFTINCK:           Mr. Chairman, I particularly welcome 
&#13;
        th1s new feature in the Bank lending applied in these two&#13;
        cases.          I think it is very gratifying that the American&#13;
        market is being opened up for such borrowing, although one&#13;
        is inclined to give it some reflection                 w:~th   respect to the&#13;
        present dollar problem.               The amounts are small, so I don't&#13;
        think     ~_t    1.5   var:.r important.,&#13;
             The first question which has come to my mind when&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                 26&#13;
2         studylng these two papers 1s this one.            The Bank has made in&#13;
&#13;
          recent years substant ial loans to the major- prtvate steal&#13;
&#13;
          companies of Japan, and I think thts being a prtvate sector&#13;
&#13;
          it i.s fortunate that the Bank was tn a posit:ton to equally&#13;
&#13;
          divide its assistance to the major private stoel companies&#13;
&#13;
          in this C'ountry.       Here we are faced with proposals with&#13;
&#13;
          respect to   tt'lO   of the six, and I would like to inquire&#13;
&#13;
          whether th(! Bank has in m:tnd to star:-t a. full s':?cond round,&#13;
&#13;
          whether this means that in the future we may expect the four&#13;
&#13;
          other big ones to be        ftr~a.nced   partly or jointly by our Bank.&#13;
&#13;
               1'-1y second questIon refers to the need for foreign&#13;
&#13;
          ftnancl ng in these part i (''llar cases.        If we look into the&#13;
&#13;
          technical report with respect to the Ka,.,a.saki steel project 1&#13;
&#13;
     !	   on. page 11, paragraph 50, aIlO study the ftnancial plan for&#13;
&#13;
          the construction period ending April 30, 1962, it appears&#13;
&#13;
          that the Bank loan and PT't vate financtng and domest Ie&#13;
&#13;
          debentures are a requtrement to cover the capital investments,              l&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          as projected.        But if we take into cons iderat ion that th -i.s 
&#13;
&#13;
          company has just dl?ctded to float a share issue in the 
&#13;
&#13;
     l    a.mount of $24 milllon eqUivalent, then one wonders whether&#13;
    :~&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          there v-rtll indeed be such a great need for Bank ass istance&#13;
&#13;
          as perhaps before we knew about this share issue, because&#13;
&#13;
          to me wtth the proceeds of thts share tssue in the amount of&#13;
&#13;
          $24 million the company I s total requi.rements for the rema indetÂ­&#13;
&#13;
          of. the construction pertod, the next two years, will already&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                               27&#13;
&#13;
3   be covered even without the Bank ass latance and the private&#13;
&#13;
    placement.    This could only be explained by addltional i,nvestjÂ­&#13;
                                                                                    I&#13;
    ment perhaps wh 1.ch the company has in mind fox' the future, but&#13;
&#13;
    I have some doubt whetheI' it is fully justified to make&#13;
&#13;
    available a considerable amount from the point of view of&#13;
&#13;
    Japan, a considerable amount of foreign capital, under such&#13;
&#13;
    favorable lnternal capital market conditions, which allow&#13;
&#13;
    them to raise $24 mil1ton in the home market.&#13;
&#13;
          This applies also to      th~   other project, the Sumltomo&#13;
&#13;
    project   0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
          It appears to me that Japan should be rather selectlve&#13;
&#13;
    in chOOSing prnjects fop which It wants            fOI'etgr~   capital&#13;
&#13;
    ClSS1.stance, aI'll:'! I think the   Internal   ~ondtttolls    tn Japan&#13;
&#13;
    and the balance Â·:Jf payments pos tt ton would allow them to be&#13;
&#13;
    somewhat cautious in incurring foreign indebtedness.                The&#13;
&#13;
     alance of payments posit ion 1s not of such a character that&#13;
&#13;
    there appears to be a great shortage of foreign exchange.&#13;
&#13;
    The internal capital market seems to be rather liqutd.                    On&#13;
    the other hand, there are great development needs, particuÂ­&#13;
&#13;
    larly tn the public sector and the infrastructure sector,&#13;
&#13;
    and therefor'e I would like to ask whether the staff agrees&#13;
&#13;
    that a great    ~ectivity     in chOOSing projects to be financed&#13;
&#13;
    from abroad is to be recommended.&#13;
&#13;
          Finally, on page 13, paragraph 59, of the technical&#13;
&#13;
    report, it is stated that the company has requested that the:&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        23&#13;
&#13;
4    base of the rat io between debt and equity could be ra ised from&#13;
     30 billion yen to 32 billion yen, and the Bank has been&#13;
     agreeable to consent.       NOw, in view of the new share lsslle        I&#13;
&#13;
     w:mderedwhether there was ar.lY lleed for changing that base.           I&#13;
&#13;
                   there was.    There again the Bank view can be&#13;
     explained, if my assumption Ls correct that the new stock&#13;
     issue came to the cognizance of the Bank only after the Bank&#13;
     had agreed to this change in the ratio.         But it makes the&#13;
      impress ton that th is company is anx i.ous to attract as much&#13;
     capital as possible in view of future developnent prospects&#13;
     and not so much for the present program a.s         submitted to the&#13;
     Bank.&#13;
             Thank you.&#13;
             THE CHAIRMAN:    Mr. Kheradjou.&#13;
             MR. KHERADJOU:     On your first question, most of the&#13;
     loans that Dr. Ltefttnck ment toned were made under the second&#13;
     steel expansion program, and it was clearly understood by&#13;
     both s ides that these t\..ro loans were cons idered as an end&#13;
     of the second expansion program.          So at the same time we were&#13;
     given to understand well that there were no other projects&#13;
    i under the second expansion program waiting to be proposed,&#13;
&#13;
     so that there can be no tmplted commitment to make loans to&#13;
     any other steel companies.&#13;
             THE CHAIRMAN:    we agree with you as to the importance of;&#13;
     the select tv it y of the Japanese Government.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                             -:&gt;0&#13;

&#13;

5              MR .. THIBAUD:         I th ir..k that we can agree with Mr.&#13;
&#13;
         Lieftinck that it ts very difficult to keep pace with the&#13;
&#13;
         Japallese steel compantes bec8.use they are growing so fast so&#13;
                                                                                                    I&#13;
         that tn every six months we have to review everything.                                     I&#13;
                                                                                                    I&#13;
                                                                                                    I&#13;

         tr5   mtlliou, and th1.s 1s why they need to increase their&#13;
         equtty base.         It is not for this DI'ogram; l.t is for the next&#13;

     : program ..&#13;
&#13;
                  NON,   when we rece! ved this we                 looke(~   also to see if this&#13;
&#13;
         ~1ould    affect the over-e.ll financial position of the company, put&#13;

         we are already sat is fied that 1t wtll not.                         The c.:&gt;mpany remn Hw&#13;

&#13;
         remains in no       lo~ter     financial position, which is exc:ellent.&#13;
&#13;
         AS a matter of fact, I have the figures of the relation&#13;
    :'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    Ii between debt and equity, and we had forecast that the worst&#13;
         point would be in a yeB.T' from now, when the total debt to&#13;
&#13;
         equity ratio would reach 55 to 45, and right now we Bee in&#13;
         the new figures it will only reach 52 to 48, which means that&#13;
         the truth is that sales a.r,d earnings c,re much higher, but&#13;
         they have to invest to continue to increase much more than&#13;
         what they exvected.&#13;
                 THE CHAIHMArr:        Does that cover both of your points?&#13;
                 MIL, LIEFTINCK:         In a certain sense, yes, it does, sh'o&#13;
                 THE CH.L\IRI\1AN:.    Any other questions?&#13;
&#13;
                 MR. .. tilLSON:      Mro Chairman, I wonder 5.f I could ask a&#13;
&#13;
         question about the pr'ocurement policy in relation to each of&#13;
&#13;
         these two loans.             In the first one, the Kawasaki loan, it&#13;
         says in paragraph 24 of your report that bids are limited&#13;
         to domeat 1c s uppl iers only where past experience has show!)&#13;
         that tt is clearly more advantageous for the company to&#13;
&#13;
         purchase the gooos in Japan.              It could be argued that if it&#13;
         is clearly advantageous to place the orders in Japan that&#13;
         the foreign potential suppliers would equally be aware of&#13;
         thts circumstance and would not themselves put 1n bids tf&#13;
&#13;
         t,hey   are invited to do         sOo   I am wondering really what is the&#13;
         reason in these cases for limiting domestic suppliers where&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       32 
&#13;
&#13;
      it is so clearly advantageous, and in these cases who it is&#13;
      that decides whether a particular bid is gotng to be put&#13;
      out to international tender or limited to domestic suppliers.&#13;
           I have another question, aleo on procuremento          Again it&#13;
      is stated in your report, in paragraph 23, that the procureÂ­&#13;
      ment of the imported goode is by international bidding, and&#13;
 i&#13;
Ii&#13;
d&#13;
      I see in paragraph 17 that the total foreign exchange cost&#13;
      for imports 1s $988 million.    The proposed Bank loan is&#13;
      $7 million, which would cover most of the imported equipment.&#13;
      And again in the appraisal report, on page 9, paragraph 45,&#13;
 i	   it says that contracts ha ve alreaCly been placed on a comÂ­&#13;
                                                                              i&#13;
      petltive basts, and the major pieces of equipment will have tal&#13;
                                                                              I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
      be imported, and fore ign orders have been placed through 
&#13;
      international competitive biddingo 
&#13;
           I am not clear whether the t"lhole of the Bank loan is 
&#13;
 'I   going for imported equipment or whether part of it is going 
&#13;
      to be used for the purchase of domestic equipment, and in 
&#13;
      the case of domest ic equipment   ~lhat   the pos it ion is about 
&#13;
      international competitive bidding. 
&#13;
           MR. THIBAUD:    I think the answer to your last question&#13;
      is that in the case of Sumtt orno the whole loan is for imported,&#13;
      equipment.   we canbnly cover part of the total foreign exchan~&#13;
      requirements.    In the case of Kawasaki., part of it is for&#13;
      imported equipment and part of it is to cover local currency&#13;
      expend1.tures.&#13;
&amp;#12;8              Now, referring to the competitive bidding, they decide&#13;
     really if it is better to ask for foreign suppliers to bid,&#13;
     but we are very careful ana review their orders.              We receive&#13;
     every three months a detail of the orders and the contracts&#13;
    , that they have placed, and we can know right away what are&#13;
     the goods that should be produced in Japan.               For instance,&#13;
     there is no question they could produce a blast furnace&#13;
    " much cheaper than they could purchase it abroad, but if they&#13;
     want to put up a hot strip mill, which is a highly specialized!                !&#13;
                                                                                    I&#13;
&#13;
                                                                                    !&#13;
     type of equipment, we would stop them and say this is tnadeÂ­&#13;
     quate, that they can't produce that now.            Perhaps in fi va or&#13;
     ten years they will be able to do ita&#13;
               MR. NILSON:    I am. not quest iOlJing at all that they could!&#13;
&#13;
     produce a blast furnace very much cheaper thaIl they could&#13;
     get; It from abroad, but        tf   they could produce it what ts the&#13;
     objection to tnvitlng bids internationally for everybody who&#13;
     thinks they may be able to compete w1th the domestic producÂ­&#13;
     tion?&#13;
               MRo THmAUD:     The only thing is it is very expensive to&#13;
     prepare a bid, and I don't think you could get any German or&#13;
     u. 	 S~    bids for a blast furnace in Japan.&#13;
               MR. WILSON:    It is only to save the expense really?&#13;
               MRo THIBAUD:    Yes, I tiink you are   ri~~to     The apecificaÂ­&#13;
     t ion is perhaps .:oliger'.     We shouldn It say it La limf.ted.         It&#13;
     is not limited"          It is limited because they know that no ODe&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                                      33&#13;
9   will come, and they donlt invite them and don't go shopping&#13;
&#13;
    around" but it io widely known" and I suppose if a supplier&#13;
&#13;
    would really think he could get Japanese constructors then he&#13;
&#13;
    could go int'.) it and      'tIe   would probably sl:.pport h i!Il.&#13;
&#13;
             MRo KNAPP:     could I just add this comment.           I think what&#13;
    ti   e are really after here in a 11 these cases ts to see that&#13;
&#13;
    good bustness judgment is exercised, and I think we have a&#13;
&#13;
    good deal of confidence tn the business judgment of these&#13;
&#13;
         Japanese companies to know where they can buy cheaply and&#13;
&#13;
    e i'fe ct t vely   0&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
             ME .. ROSEN:   \'lhell we d 1d the road loan s lx months ago             'ite&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
    tl1ere very much concerned a.bout the quest ion of bidd ing, and&#13;
&#13;
    at that time we asked and received agreement for the ftrst&#13;
&#13;
    t tme that road construct ton contracts .tn Japan \tlOuld be put&#13;
&#13;
    out to competitive bi-ddtng, and this was              done~   'I'here is&#13;
&#13;
    quite a lOllS periodof t tme" first of tran.s lat ing spec if! oaÂ­&#13;
&#13;
    tiona and advertising, and after all this was done only two&#13;
&#13;
     foreign firms ind icated an interest in bidd ing, an(l then&#13;
&#13;
     finally neither of the two firms came through with a                 b~.d   ..&#13;
&#13;
    So the situation that Mro Thi'baud is mentioning of the fact&#13;
&#13;
    that when the work is not that of productng equtpment,                  wh~ch&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     ts imported, but basIcally a ronstruction activity or&#13;
&#13;
    erection activity with}.r the cDu.ntr'y, the experience we have&#13;
&#13;
    had     011   th!.s highway loan shows that Japanese firms will be&#13;
&#13;
     cheaper and that foretgn flrms know that they \'lould not be&#13;
&amp;#12;10   able to     ~ompete.      It 1.8 that   exper~,ence   which led us toch j s&#13;
&#13;
     conclusion here.

           ~1R. LAR.BE::      !vlr. Chairman, I aIr. g190 the Ba,nk 1s resumillg;&#13;
&#13;
     lend tng to Japan.         I am not sure that it was just lfted for&#13;
&#13;
     the Japanese to go to the Bank s inee they seem to have other&#13;
&#13;
     resources for the:r finan(!i!1g" but I think it is very wise&#13;
&#13;
     to the Bank to lend to Japan and very good for the Bank.&#13;
                                                                                           /!W :&#13;
     My only question 1s the amount which is lent 1s Dot very                           bt[l'~&#13;
&#13;
     but otherwise I would support this loan.&#13;
&#13;
          THE CHAIRM,A'N:        Anycme else?&#13;
&#13;
          There are no participations in this loan l                     ~s   you can&#13;
&#13;
     understand,     b~cause     the whole transaction Is based on no&#13;
&#13;
     part icipations.&#13;
&#13;
           rvray I have a motion to adopt the draft resolution for&#13;
     both these transa ct ions?&#13;
&#13;
           (upon motion duly made and seconded" the draft resolu-                             I&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     . tton was adopted unanimously.)&#13;
&#13;
           THE    CHAIR~AN:      So ordered.&#13;
&#13;
           !viR. .. SUZUKI:    Hr. Cha irman l I should I ike to say             a, reIN&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                              35&#13;
11   words af appreclatlon to the Board for approval of the 10an6&#13;
&#13;
     to the Japanese steel mj lIs.&#13;
&#13;
            AS was explained by the staff, this was a joint operaÂ­&#13;
     tion, the Bank's loan tted with private tnvestment, and thls&#13;
&#13;
     we.s the first expertence for our prl vate industr1.es and it&#13;
&#13;
     was something new for the Japanese Government to process it.&#13;
&#13;
     So there were many problems we had to face.             Actually, I was I&#13;
                                                                                   i&#13;
     ~n   the Embassy here, and from the beg1.nning I had contact ..... itt}&#13;
&#13;
     all parties concerned about this matter.          If we go back to&#13;
&#13;
     the t i.me of choos ing the tnvestment bankers, rea ll~{ we ha lJe&#13;
&#13;
     spent one year, and 1n eLther case the t0P ranking officers&#13;
&#13;
     of the companies" tn the case of Sumitomo the            NOo   2 marl&#13;
&#13;
     and tn the case of Kawasaki I think the No. 3 or 4.               They&#13;
&#13;
     have been in this country for more than seven months altoÂ­&#13;
&#13;
     gether, and tn the meant1me we got the encouragement and&#13;
                                                                                   J&#13;
&#13;
     support of the Bank.       I don't think wtthout the encouragement:;&#13;
&#13;
     and support of the Bank they could go through.&#13;
&#13;
            Sometimes many people doubted whether actually this&#13;
&#13;
     could be done or not, and especially some situations beyond&#13;
&#13;
     the control    o~   the !nvestment bankers or Japanese steel&#13;
&#13;
     mills where we had deadlocks to face.          But this after all&#13;
&#13;
     t&gt;las accompl '_Shed, and thi.S was   ~   very good experience, not&#13;
&#13;
     only for those two compantes but for others         0    But after a 11 J&#13;
&#13;
     as it has been so excellently stated by the staff of the&#13;
&#13;
     Bank, tt seems thjs 1s a case where we used our            max~&gt;mum&#13;
&amp;#12;12 	   efforts, 1.11 order to carr;y out th is    k~.nd   of e. joint operat ion)&#13;

&#13;
                                                                                 I&#13;
       ano I think it can be sa.id about any other future C?ses that             I&#13;
       unless we have the support of the Bank tt Ls almost lmposB i1'.1t1&#13;
                                                                                 I&#13;
