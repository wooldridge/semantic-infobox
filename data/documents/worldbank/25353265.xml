THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT&#13;
For policy makers trying to improve their economyâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW&#13;
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory&#13;
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides&#13;
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business&#13;
                                                               Region: OECD high income&#13;

regulations applying to domestic small to medium-size          Income category: High income&#13;
businesses through their life cycle. Economies are ranked&#13;
from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 127,131,800&#13;
Doing Business presents results for 2 aggregate measures:&#13;
the distance to frontier score and the ease of doing           GNI per capita (US$): 42,000&#13;
business ranking. The ranking of economies is determined&#13;
by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 34&#13;
rounded to two decimals. An economyâ&#128;&#153;s distance to&#13;
frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 30*&#13;
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.&#13;

The ease of doing business ranking compares economies&#13;
with one another; the distance to frontier score               DB 2015 DTF: 74.72&#13;
benchmarks economies with respect to regulatory best&#13;
practice, showing the absolute distance to the best            Change in DTF: 0&#13;

compared across years, the distance to frontier score          * DB2015 ranking shown is not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published&#13;

entrepreneurs in an economy has changed over time in           captures the effects of such factors as data revisions&#13;
absolute terms, while the ease of doing business ranking       and the changes in methodology. See the data notes&#13;
can show only how much the regulatory environment has          starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016&#13;
changed relative to that in other economies.                   report for sources and definitions.&#13;

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on&#13;
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and&#13;
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,&#13;
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are&#13;
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the&#13;
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.&#13;

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last yearâ&#128;&#153;s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such&#13;
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest&#13;
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory&#13;
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific areaâ&#128;&#148;for example, insolvencyâ&#128;&#148;it&#13;
receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark. Similarly, an economy receives a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a&#13;
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a â&#128;&#156;no practiceâ&#128;&#157; mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the&#13;
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economyâ&#128;&#153;s name&#13;
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business&#13;

      clients. The Fire Office is also involved in the permit examination&#13;
      process. The application must be amended when any changes&#13;
      are made after the building permit is obtained. In addition, a&#13;
      change permit must be obtained prior to final inspection by local&#13;
      authorities.&#13;
&#13;
      After the falsification of structural calculation of buildings by&#13;
      former Architect Aneha became public knowledge in November&#13;
      2005, many Japanese local authorities and private inspection&#13;
      companies have had to spend extra time checking structural&#13;
      design documents in new applications. This situation is still very&#13;
      much true in many parts of Japan. There is also a spill-over effect&#13;
      on site inspections by privatized control institutions, and it is&#13;
      likely that the Japanese government will introduce more frequent&#13;
      and thorough inspection procedures in building construction in&#13;
      the near future. Building permit review and approval procedures&#13;
      became very stringent since the new Building regulation as of&#13;
      June 20, 2007. As of June 2007 any project exceeding 1,000 sq.&#13;
      m. will require a peer review process by an independent&#13;
      authorized structural engineer/agency. The engineers are&#13;
      generally hired by the Building Department to undertake this&#13;
      review. However, the amount of work and backlog on one hand&#13;
      and the number of available professionals on the other hand&#13;
      willing to work extra hours on the weekends has caused delays.&#13;
      The peer review may take about 30 days in addition to the 50&#13;
      days of building permit review period. In simpler cases the&#13;
      process may take on average 70 days.&#13;

      * Request and obtain workmenâ&#128;&#153;s compensation insurance&#13;
      proof from Labor Control Office&#13;
&#13;
      The Labor Control Office verifies worker compensation insurance&#13;
      for all companies annually. No cost is incurred for obtaining&#13;
      confirmation. Once a contractor obtains confirmation and&#13;
      insurance, it is valid for one year for any project of the&#13;
      contractorâ&#128;&#153;s company. Application for worker compensation&#13;
      insurance is made with the local labor control office. The&#13;
      applicant must comply with the registration criteria. A worker        60 days       no charge&#13;
4&#13;
      compensation insurance fee must be paid within 50 days after&#13;
      the application is filed. Worker compensation insurance is valid&#13;
      for a year, and it must be extended every year between April 1&#13;
      and May 20. The insurance cost is 2.05% of the company's total&#13;
      personnel costs (1.25% paid by employer, 0.8% paid by&#13;
      employee).&#13;

        Register the building with the Land and Building Registry&#13;

        The building registration involves two steps. First, the description&#13;
        of the building should be registered (usually through a notary&#13;
        public). This part cannot be done by BuildCo or its lawyer. No&#13;
        formal registration cost is required.&#13;
&#13;
        Second, proof of building ownership should be registered. It&#13;
  12    takes about 10 to 14 days for the registration to be completed.          12 days        JPY 399,244&#13;
        The cost of proof of building ownership registration varies&#13;
        depending on the value of the building (0.2% of the buildingâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
        taxable value).&#13;

GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
Access to reliable and affordable electricity is vital for     WHAT THE GETTING ELECTRICITY&#13;
businesses. To counter weak electricity supply, many&#13;
firms in developing economies have to rely on self-            INDICATORS MEASURE&#13;
supply, often at a prohibitively high cost. Whether&#13;
electricity is reliably available or not, the first step for   Procedures to obtain an electricity connection&#13;
a customer is always to gain access by obtaining a             (number)&#13;
connection.&#13;

        There is no external inspection. As there is no inspection of the internal&#13;
        wiring, TEPCO is asking the customer for the necessary information&#13;
        regarding the licensed electrician who did the internal wiring. Japanese&#13;
        laws require every owner/user to hire a licensed electrician to install the&#13;
        wiring. The information is submitted on the formatted application&#13;
        document and contains the name, license number and contact&#13;
        information of the electrician. There is no notarization needed for the&#13;
        documents, however the signature of the customer needs to be on the&#13;
        documents when applying online. The contractor building the warehouse&#13;
   2    will usually make an application for power supply and connection several 93 calendar days         JPY 0&#13;
        months before the required date of the connection to allow TEPCO&#13;
        sufficient time to survey the proposed area in terms of electricity supply&#13;
        route and capacity required for the specific building. If the electricity&#13;
        main supply is not suitable, TEPCO will carry out necessary infrastructure&#13;
        work to provide the required utility services. There is usually no estimate&#13;
        prior to the determination of the actual contract start date. There is no&#13;
        connection fee: In case of overhead wiring, up to 1000 meters long,&#13;
        construction work does not require any financial responsibility by the&#13;

Reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs index&#13;
&#13;
The reliability of supply and transparency of tariffs      Doing Business uses the system average interruption&#13;
index encompasses quantitative data on the duration        duration index (SAIDI) and the system average&#13;
and frequency of power outages as well as                  interruption frequency index (SAIFI) to measure the&#13;
qualitative information on the mechanisms put in           duration and frequency of power outages in the largest&#13;
place by the utility for monitoring power outages          business city of each economy (for 11 economies the data&#13;
and restoring power supply, the reporting                  are also collected for the second largest business city).&#13;
relationship between the utility and the regulator for     SAIDI is the average total duration of outages over the&#13;
power outages, the transparency and accessibility of       course of a year for each customer served, while SAIFI is&#13;
tariffs and whether the utility faces a financial          the average number of service interruptions experienced&#13;
deterrent aimed at limiting outages (such as a             by a customer in a year. Annual data (covering the&#13;
requirement to compensate customers or pay fines           calendar year) are collected from distribution utility&#13;

The index ranges from 0 to 8, with higher values&#13;
indicating greater reliability of electricity supply and&#13;
greater transparency of tariffs.&#13;

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the&#13;
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12&#13;
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an&#13;
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does&#13;
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of&#13;
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about&#13;
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for&#13;
the month of March (for 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city). As noted, the&#13;
warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff schedules may apply if a time-of-&#13;
use tariff is available.&#13;

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous&#13;
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost&#13;
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary&#13;
requirements than does the number of documents required.&#13;

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal&#13;
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:&#13;
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the&#13;
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is&#13;
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.&#13;

doing business ranking, which is based on the distance&#13;

The distance to frontier score captures the gap between&#13;

Calculating the distance to frontier score for each           or construction, including legal index scores (such as the&#13;

rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier&#13;
score for the total tax rateâ&#128;&#148;and therefore on the&#13;
distance to frontier score for paying taxesâ&#128;&#148;for&#13;
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it&#13;
would have had before this approach was adopted in&#13;
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in&#13;
figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report). And for&#13;
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is&#13;
very high relative to the average), an increase has a&#13;
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores&#13;
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line&#13;
C in figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report).&#13;
&#13;
4&#13;
  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and&#13;
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to&#13;
that from the simple average method because both these methods&#13;
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise&#13;
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the&#13;
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,&#13;
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the&#13;
context of a specific economy.&#13;
5&#13;
  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according&#13;
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned&#13;
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit&#13;
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal&#13;
weights&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This economy profile for Doing Business
            2016 presents the 11 Doing Business indicators for Japan. To
            allow for useful comparison, the profile also provides data
            for other selected economies (comparator economies) for each
            indicator. Doing Business 2016 is the 13th edition in a
            series of annual reports measuring the regulations that
            enhance business activity and those that constrain it.
            Economies are ranked on their ease of doing business; for
            2015 Japan ranks 34. A high ease of doing business ranking
            means the regulatory environment is more conducive to the
            starting and operation of a local firm. Doing Business
            presents quantitative indicators on business regulations and
            the protection of property rights that can be compared
            across 189 economies from Afghanistan to Zimbabwe and over
            time. Doing Business sheds light on how easy or difficult it
            is for a local entrepreneur to open and run a small to
            medium-size business when complying with relevant
            regulations. It measures and tracks changes in regulations
            affecting 11 areas in the life cycle of a business: starting
            a business, dealing with construction permits, getting
            electricity, registering property, getting credit,
            protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across
            borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency and labor
            market regulation. The data in this report are current as of
            June 1, 2015 (except for the paying taxes indicators, which
            cover the period from January to December 2014).
