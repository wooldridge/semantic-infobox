               The strip mill wh:lch it is proposed to finance is to take&#13;
&#13;
          the place of obsolete hand mill facilities which the company&#13;
          now owns at some distance from the site of the modern steel-&#13;
          making and slabbing facilities which have been constructed.&#13;
               This new strip mill should enable the company not only to&#13;
          produce more strip but to materially reduce their costs of&#13;
          production and to improve the quality of their product.&#13;
               Technically, therefore, the project is excellent.    As&#13;
&#13;
          Mr. Dorr has indicated to you, the difficulty here was in the&#13;
          financial position of the company, which to carry out the in-&#13;
&#13;
          vestment which it has made during the last five years had to&#13;
&#13;
          incur debts at short and medium term of approximately 30 m1111tn&#13;
          dollars equivalent.   These debts were owed to a group of in-         I&#13;
&#13;
          surance companies, banks, etcetera, and the negotiations which!&#13;
                                                                                I&#13;

          cooperation on the part of the creditors and the attitude of&#13;
          Daiichi Bank made it poss:1.ble to produce the result which has       I&#13;
          been achieved, and briefly this should enable the company to&#13;
          achieve three necessary objectives in the financial field:       in&#13;
          the first place, to be sure that during the construction perio&#13;

                      These arrangements are complicated because they arise out&#13;
                 of, on the one hand, the desire of the Bank to maintain its&#13;
                 usual standard as to assurance that projects will be carried&#13;
                 out, that local funds will be available as well to match and&#13;
                 make effective the loans made by the Bank, on the other hand&#13;
                 the desire of the Japanese Government to combine these trans-&#13;
                 actions into one and to have the loan made not to the govern-&#13;
                 ment, which might to many of us have seemed the normal thing&#13;
                 to do, but to the Corporation which is to carry out some but&#13;
                 not all of the projects; and we felt that while this did 1m-&#13;

            of loan to Japan Development Bank for the Kawasaki Steel
            Corporation Strip Mill Project. Oral reports relating to the
            general and technical aspects of the loan were provided
            during the meeting. The economic situation of Japan was
            discussed during the meeting, and a statement was provided
            by the U.S. Alternate Director that U.S. approval of the
            loan has no relation to scrap requirements from U.S.

            participate in the loan for the Kawasaki Steel Corporation
            Strip Mill Project to the extent of 1.25 million dollars.
