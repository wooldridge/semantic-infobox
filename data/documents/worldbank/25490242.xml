ECB signals possibility of more stimulus.&#13;
&#13;
Financial Markets&#13;
&#13;
European bonds and stocks traded higher while the euro fell on Thursday as the European Central Bank&#13;
president Mario Draghi signaled more stimulus is on its way. The Stoxx 600 stock index jumped 1.6&#13;
percent, and government bond yields fell sharply across the region, with the yields of peripheral Eurozone&#13;
bonds posting the sharpest drops. At the same time, the single currency slid more than 1.5 percent to&#13;
below $1.12, the lowest level in two weeks.&#13;
&#13;
The U.S. Treasury Department is postponing an auction of 2-year notes that had originally scheduled for&#13;
October 27 due to worries about the looming debt ceiling. Treasury said it was concerned the auction&#13;
wouldnâ&#128;&#153;t be able to settle as scheduled on November 2, the day before the borrowing-limit deadline is&#13;
reached. Meanwhile, Treasury will still hold auctions for 5-year and 7-year notes set for next week, and it&#13;
said postponing the 2-year note poses less risk for market functioning than for the longer-term debt.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
High Income Economies&#13;
&#13;
In addition to robust growth in new U.S. housing starts, further indications of housing market firming come&#13;
from a 4.7 percent (m/m) increase in the sale of existing homes in September, and gains in prices at an&#13;
annualized rate of 4 percent or higher since September 2012. The National Association of Homebuilders&#13;
reported that sentiment among builders in October also rose to its highest level in a decade, and expects&#13;
a bigger contribution to U.S. GDP growth from residential investment in the coming quarters.&#13;
&#13;
The European Central Bank held the refinancing rate at 0.05 percent, the deposit rate at -0.20 percent&#13;
and the marginal lending rate at 0.30 percent. The interest rates were last lowered by 10 basis points in&#13;
September 2014. However, the Bank signaled that it would review the â&#128;&#156;degree of monetary policy&#13;
accommodationâ&#128;&#157; through its asset-purchasing program in December as emerging markets growth&#13;
prospects have weakened and recent developments in financial and commodity markets are posing risks&#13;
to the growth outlook for the Eurozone.&#13;
&#13;
Consumer confidence in the Euro Area weakened in October, with the Consumer Economic Sentiment&#13;
Indicator reported by the European Commission falling to -7.7 in October, from -7.1 in September (the&#13;
indicator ranges from -100 to 100, where zero indicates neutrality). This is the lowest level since January&#13;
2015.&#13;
&#13;
U.K. retail sales rose sharply in September, increasing by 1.9 percent (m/m), and posting the biggest gain&#13;
since December 2013. Sales were led by household goods and auto fuel. Retail sales were up 6.5&#13;
percent (y/y). Separately, the budget deficit for September was the smallest for the month in 8 years, as&#13;
revenues rose 3.9 percent (y/y), while expenditure increased by only 1.0 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Developing Economies&#13;
&#13;
                                                     1&#13;
&amp;#12;East Asia and Pacific&#13;
&#13;
Amid lower credit costs and easy access to funds, the MNI China Business Indicator surged 8.4 percent&#13;
to 55.6, the largest increase since March 2011, following the 8.3 percent drop in September. Interest&#13;
rates has fallen to the lowest since 2012, as four rate cuts from the People's Bank of China this year&#13;
filtered through the economy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Latin America and the Caribbean&#13;
Brazilâ&#128;&#153;s jobless rate was 7.6 percent in September, unchanged from August, which is the highest since&#13;
March 2010. Unemployment has been increasing for the past 10 consecutive months. The number of&#13;
unemployed persons in six of Brazilâ&#128;&#153;s major metropolitan areas was 1.85 million, broadly unchanged from&#13;
1.86 million in August.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
&#13;
Google is set to buy a 12 percent stake in the Lake Turkana Wind Power Project in Kenya, a project&#13;
which is expected to generate 310 megawatts (MW) equivalent to 15 percent of the nation's energy by&#13;
April 2017. At Ksh70 billion (â&#130;¬625 million), the project is the largest single private investment in Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
history and is the largest wind investment in Africa. It is hoped that the project will attract more&#13;
investment into Africaâ&#128;&#153;s energy sector.&#13;
