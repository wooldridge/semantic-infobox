otherwise provided herein, the Trustee shall administer the funds, assets and receipts that&#13;
constitute the Trust Fund only for the purpose of, and in accordance with, the relevant&#13;
decisions of the Board of the GCF (the "Board"). The Trustee shall be closely consulted&#13;

of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any applicable law, all of which are&#13;
expressly reserved.&#13;
3.    Commingling, Exchange and Investment of the Contributions&#13;
3.1.  The Contributions shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be kept&#13;
separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. For administrative and investment&#13;
purposes, the Contributions may be commingled with other trust fund assets maintained&#13;
by the Bank.&#13;
3.2.  The Contributions may be freely exchanged by the Trustee into other currencies&#13;
as may facilitate their disbursement.&#13;
4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿3.3.  The Trustee shall invest and reinvest the Contributions pending their&#13;
disbursement in accordance with the Bank's policies and procedures for the investment of&#13;

3/CP. 17) (the "GCF Governing Instrument"); and&#13;
(iii)  Providing resources for other activities to be financed under the GCF as&#13;
approved by the Board.&#13;
5.    Procedures to Govern the Transfer of Trust Fund Resources&#13;
5.1.  The Trustee shall, subject to paragraph 4.1 above:&#13;
(i)   Make available Trust Fund resources in the amount approved by the Board&#13;
or the Authorized Designee to the secretariat of the Global Environment Facility (the&#13;

GCF;&#13;
(ii)   Transfer Trust Fund resources in the amount approved by the Board or the&#13;

paragraph 5.1 (ii), (iii) or (iv) above shall be made in the manner and procedures as may&#13;
be agreed between the Trustee and the relevant entity.&#13;

or the Authorized Designee of the administrative budget to cover the costs associated&#13;
with the interim secretariat of the GCF for the period from January 1, 2012 to October 31,&#13;
2012 (the "Interim Secretariat Budget"), the Trustee may make available to the GEF&#13;
Secretariat and/or transfer to the UNFCCC Secretariat the Trust Fund resources up to the&#13;

exceed the amount of the Interim Secretariat Budget proposed to the Board for its&#13;
approval.&#13;
5.4.  Upon the transfer of Trust Fund resources to any of the entities under paragraph&#13;

use of the Trust Fund resources transferred by the Trustee and the activities carried out&#13;
therewith in accordance with the applicable decisions of the Board or the Authorized&#13;
Designee, including the purpose for which the resources have been approved. The&#13;

paragraph 4.1 above, the Trustee shall submit to the Board or the Authorized Designee a&#13;
proposal for administrative budget to cover the full costs of services to be provided by the&#13;
Trustee in the upcoming budget period (and/or the services provided prior to the&#13;
execution of this Agreement) in connection with the performance of its functions under&#13;
this Agreement, which shall be paid from the Trust Fund resources. Upon approval by the&#13;
Board or the Authorized Designee of such a proposal, the Trustee shall transfer the&#13;
amount to its own account from the Trust Fund resources; provided that, the amount of&#13;
the resources transferred shall be subject to an end of budget period adjustment on the&#13;
basis of full cost recovery for the services provided during the budget period.&#13;
6.    Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;
6.1.  The Trustee shall maintain separate records and ledger accounts in respect of the&#13;

concerning the adequacy of internal control over cash-based financial reporting for all&#13;
cash-based trust funds as a whole; and (ii) a combined financial statement for all cash-&#13;
based trust funds together with the Bank's external auditor's opinion thereon. The cost of&#13;
the single audit shall be borne by the Bank.&#13;
6.4.  If the Board or a Contributor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a&#13;
financial statement audit by the Bank's external auditors of the Trust Fund, the costs of&#13;
any such audit, including the internal costs of the Bank with respect to such audit, shall&#13;
be paid by the Trust Fund if the audit was requested by the Board or paid by the&#13;
requesting Contributor if the audit was requested by the Contributor.&#13;
6.5.  Subject to paragraph 9 below, the Trustee shall provide to the interim secretariat&#13;
or the independent secretariat of the GCF, as applicable, information on the financial&#13;
status of the Trust Fund, including copies of Trust Fund contribution agreements, in a&#13;
form and frequency to be agreed between the Trustee and the interim secretariat or the&#13;
independent secretariat of the GCF, as applicable.&#13;
7.    Amendment&#13;
7.1.  Except as provided for under paragraph 7.2, the Standard Provisions contained in&#13;
this Annex may be amended only with the agreement of all Contributors contributing to&#13;
the Trust Fund and the Trustee, and upon approval by the Board. In the event of any such&#13;
amendments to the Standard Provisions, each Contributor agrees that the Trustee shall&#13;
provide the Contributor with the amended Standard Provisions, and they shall replace this&#13;
Annex without requiring the Contributor and the Trustee to enter into any amendments to&#13;
this Agreement.&#13;
7.2.  Unless the Contributor and the Trustee shall otherwise agree, once the Trustee&#13;
and the GCF shall have concluded the legal arrangement between them for the Trustee's&#13;
services as interim trustee of the GCF, each Contributor agrees that the Trustee shall&#13;
administer its Contribution in accordance with the terms of the legal provisions&#13;
concluded between the Trustee and the GCF, in which case the Trustee shall provide the&#13;
Contributor with such legal provisions, and they shall replace this Annex without&#13;
requiring the Contributor and the Trustee to enter into any amendments to this&#13;
Agreement.&#13;

to the Board.&#13;

pursuant to paragraph 8.1, 8.2 or 8.3 above, the Bank shall carry on no business for the&#13;

Bank shall, in consultation with the Board to the extent possible, take all necessary action&#13;
for winding up its affairs in an expeditious manner, including for the transferring of Trust&#13;
Fund assets to the successor, and for meeting outstanding commitments.&#13;
