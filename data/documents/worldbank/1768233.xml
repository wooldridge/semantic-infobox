Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex 1&#13;
A.     BACKGROUND AND STRATEGY&#13;
I.     Background to the Conflict&#13;
1.    Eritrea's struggle for independence began in 1961, following the annexation of Eritrea by&#13;
Ethiopia, and intensified following the military coup in Ethiopia in 1974. The Eritrean People's&#13;
Liberation Front (EPLF) gained control of Eritrea in May 1991. Following an internationally&#13;
supervised referendum, Eritrea gained independence on May 24, 1993.&#13;
2.     Open conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia erupted in May 1998, as a consequence of a&#13;
dispute over their common border in the Badme region. Until May 2000, the fighting was&#13;
restricted to a relatively limited area within Eritrea displacing some 270,000 people from the&#13;
border areas. However, on May 12, 2000, and for five weeks thereafter, the war took on far larger&#13;
proportions with far more dramatic consequences . On this occasion, Ethiopian troops advanced&#13;
approximately 100 km deep into Eritrean territory, causing an even more dramatic humanitarian&#13;
crisis as well as widespread destruction of physical infrastructure.&#13;
3.     The two countries agreed to a Cessation of Hostilities on June 18, 2000, and signed a&#13;
comprehensive Peace Accord on December 12, 2000. The agreement called for the withdrawal of&#13;
the Ethiopian army from Eritrean territory and the deployment of a UN peacekeeping force along&#13;
a 25 kilometer-wide Temporary Security Zone (TSZ) between the two countries until the border&#13;
is demarcated by a neutral Boundary Commission. The UN Security Council authorized the&#13;
establishment of a United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE) in July 2000, and a&#13;
peacekeeping force of up to 4,200 in September 2000. The peacekeeping force was fully&#13;
deployed by March 2001. UNMEE announced the formal establishment of the TSZ on April 18,&#13;
2001, following the redeployment of Eritrean forces to the northern boundary of the TSZ. The&#13;
establishment of the TSZ allows for the restoration of civil administration and the return of&#13;
internally displaced persons (IDPs) to the areas of the TSZ.&#13;
II.    Humanitarian Impact&#13;
47     The escalation of fighting in May 2000 had a severe humanitarian impact. The most&#13;
dranatic consequence was the sudden displacement of approximately 1.1 million people. This&#13;
represented 70 % of the population of the Gash Barka and Debub regions, which host 47 percent&#13;
of the total Eritrean population and contribute 70 percent of its total grain production. An&#13;
estimated 75,000 Eritreans and Ethiopians of Eritrean origin have also been forcibly deported&#13;
from Ethiopia.&#13;
5.    The war has had a severely detrimental impact on local food production capacity, and the&#13;
Government of Eritrea (GOE)JUN needs assessment undertaken at the end of 2000 determined&#13;
that 1.76 million rural people would require varying levels of food aid during 2001. This negative&#13;
impact of the war on the country's food security has been further compounded by drought. Some&#13;
738,000 people in Eritrea are estimated to have been affected by drought, many of whom had also&#13;
been directly affected by the war.&#13;
III.   Economic Impact&#13;
6.     Since the armed conflict began in May 1998, Eritrea has suffered substantial economic&#13;
stress. The direct war damage; humanitarian needs for the internally displaced; mobilization of&#13;
some 200,000 men and women; increases in military spending; drought; decline in private sector&#13;
activity and loss of port revenues, have all combined to depress the economy. Having averaged 7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex              2&#13;
percent between 1994-97, the real GDP growth rate fell significantly during the war and became&#13;
negative in 2000 at -10.9 percent. Inflation averaged 3.7 percent in 1997 and rose to 19.9 percent&#13;
in 2000. The budget deficit increased to 48.1 percent of GDP in 2000 from 5.6 percent in 1997.&#13;
The war has threatened Eritrea's efforts to reduce poverty. With a per capita income among the&#13;
lowest in Africa (US$200), Eritrea is one of the poorest countries in the world. Furthermore, most&#13;
of the country's social indicators, such as average life expectancy (51 years) and infant mortality&#13;
(135 per 1,000 live births), tend to be lower than the averages for Sub-Saharan Africa.&#13;
7.     The mobilization and maintenance of the troops enlisted for the war contributed&#13;
significantly to the fiscal stress. The maintenance costs with regards to the wage bill (not&#13;
including individual food and household allowances) are estimated to average US$60 million per&#13;
year. These expenditures are a significant drain on the national budget. Furthermore, the absence&#13;
of a significant proportion of the labor force from active economic life has impacted the economy&#13;
negatively. Many government offices and public and private enterprises have come close to a&#13;
standstill over the last two years because a large part of the manpower, including staff in key&#13;
positions, is still mobilized.&#13;
8.     Following the signing of the Cessation of Hostilities agreement in June 2000, the&#13;
immediate priorities were to find the fiscal space to finance rehabilitation expenditures and to&#13;
stabilize the economy. Critical measures to achieve these goals are reductions in military&#13;
expenditure and mobilization of donor aid. Substantial inflows of donor aid for humanitarian&#13;
relief and for rehabilitation have, so far, met the most imnediate needs.&#13;
9.     Preliminary estimates for 2001 suggest that there has been good progress in stabilizing&#13;
the economy through the first quarter of 2001. Inflation fell from 26.8 percent at the end of 2000,&#13;
to 7.7 percent by end 2001 thanks to tight fiscal policy that limited recourse to domestic bank&#13;
financing of the deficit. The budget deficit fell from 48.1 percent of GDP for 2000 to 32.7 percent&#13;
of GDP in 2001.&#13;
IV.    Govermnent Response&#13;
10.   The Government and the people of Eritrea immediately reacted to the humanitarian crisis&#13;
on two fronts: (i) by providing emergency relief and assistance to the IDPs and the host&#13;
communities; and (ii) by organizing the available human and financial resources to start&#13;
rehabilitating the areas damaged by the recent invasion. GOE also appealed for foreign&#13;
humanitarian and reconstruction assistance in response to the crisis that evolved as a result of the&#13;
war.&#13;
11.   In November 2000, following the deployment of the UNMEE peacekeeping force and&#13;
prompted by significant progress in the peace process, GOE announced its intention to launch a&#13;
demobilization and reintegration program, building on the previous GOE program, international&#13;
experiences and best practice. In November 2000, GOE requested the Bank to provide technical&#13;
assistance in the preparation of a comprehensive demobilization and reintegration program in&#13;
collaboration with UNDP and other development partners. GOE plans to reduce its army by two&#13;
thirds and demobilize 200,000 troops within a two-year time frame. The troops to be demobilized&#13;
consist of remobilized ex-soldiers, people serving in the mandatory National Service program,&#13;
and soldiers from the regular armed forces. To lead this effort, GOE established a National&#13;
Commission for the Demobilization and Reintegration Program (NCDRP) by proclamation on&#13;
April 10, 2001.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex            3&#13;
V.     International Response&#13;
12.   Since the outbreak of hostilities in May 1998, most donors have responded favorably to&#13;
the different humanitarian appeals put out by the Government. A consolidated appeal to seek&#13;
international support for emergency and relief needs was launched by ERREC in collaboration&#13;
with the UN in February 2001, for US$132 million.&#13;
13.   Following the signing of the Cessation of Hostilities Agreement on June 18, 2000, most&#13;
donors have resumed development activities in Eritrea. In support of the GOE's overriding&#13;
objectives of rebuilding the economy and restoring social services, the Bank helped GOE prepare&#13;
and coordinate a US$288 million multi-donor Emergency Reconstruction Program (ERP). This&#13;
ERP is to assist Eritrea rebuild its physical and social infrastructure, help displaced and drought-&#13;
affected people resume economic activities and rebuild their lives, and assist GOE to procure&#13;
essential imports through balance of payments (BOP) support. In addition to an IDA credit of&#13;
US$90 mnillion, which was approved in November 2000, ERP is financed by the European Union,&#13;
Italy, Denmark, France, the African Development Bank, and GOE. This is complemented by a&#13;
US$16 million United Nations Development Program (UNDP)/GOE emergency and&#13;
rehabilitation program, financed by the Italian Government, and several non-governmental&#13;
organization (NGO)-assisted projects. The 2001 UN Consolidated Inter-Agency Appeal for&#13;
Eritrea was launched in January 2001 with the aim of raising US$133.2 million for support of&#13;
activities, such as food security, voluntary repatriation and reintegration, health and nutrition,&#13;
family shelter and household items, mine action, water supply and environmental sanitation, and&#13;
education. By July 25, 2001, 40 percent of the requirement was raised.&#13;
14.   UNDP provided critical support through an exploratory mission on demobilization and&#13;
reintegration of soldiers in October 2000, and a small preparatory project to support the GOE&#13;
planning process.&#13;
B.     BANK RESPONSE AND STRATEGY&#13;
1.     The Elements of Bank Response&#13;
15.   From the outbreak of hostilities in May 1998 to the signing of the cessation of hostilities&#13;
agreement in June 2000, no new lending operations were approved for Eritrea. However, the&#13;
Bank maintained its ongoing portfolio and continued with the preparation of new projects for&#13;
presentation to the Board once the time would be appropriate. The focus would be on urgent,&#13;
high-impact operations, which would have large benefits for the poor and an unquestionable&#13;
developmental impact.&#13;
16.   During the last outbreak of hostilities and the unfolding of the humanitarian crisis, the&#13;
Bank received a request from the GOE for emergency assistance. With the signing of the&#13;
Cessation of Hostilities, the Bank reallocated a total of US$24.9 million from other ongoing IDA&#13;
projects in Eritrea to emergency support (essential drugs and other urgently needed medical&#13;
supplies; water supply and sanitation subprojects in areas with high concentrations of IDPs;&#13;
nutritional supplements, kitchen utensils, stoves, agricultural inputs, and associated transport&#13;
services). In July 2000, the Board approved the Eritrea Early Childhood Development Project&#13;
(US$40 million), the first new lending operation in two years. In addition to the US$90 million&#13;
credit for ERP, which was approved in November 2000, the Bank has also formulated the&#13;
HIV/AIDS, Malaria, STDs &amp; TB Control Project (HAMSET), which was approved in December&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex             4&#13;
2000. The total cost of HAMSET is US$60 million, of which US$40 million is covered by an&#13;
IDA credit.&#13;
17.   Upon invitation by GOE, an IDA identification mission visited Eritrea in December&#13;
2000. The Government, the IDA mission and the international donor community reached&#13;
consensus that a demobilization and reintegration program was crucial for the social and&#13;
economic recovery of Eritrea, and that a comprehensive approach to the Emergency&#13;
Demobilization and Reintegration Program was essential. Following the signing of the Peace&#13;
Accord on December 12, 2000, GOE requested the international donor community to launch a&#13;
multi-donor assessment rission in January 2001 to prepare the Emergency Demobilization and&#13;
Reintegration Program (EDRP) This was jointly organized by the Bank and UNDP. The mission&#13;
provided technical assistance to GOE for the main components of the program, and prepared a&#13;
comprehensive EDRP framework proposal with detailed technical notes. A Post-Conflict Fund&#13;
grant of US$973,000 was approved by the Bank in January 2001, to assist the GOE set up its&#13;
institutional structure and make technical preparations.&#13;
II.    Rationale for Bank Involvement&#13;
18.   The demobilization of Eritrean soldiers is a crucial element of the ongoing peace process.&#13;
GOE will be able to reinforce its commnitment to the peace process through the effective&#13;
preparation and implementation of the project. Failure by Eritrea to demobilize a sizeable portion&#13;
of its armed forces could jeopardize the peace process. In order to grasp the opportunity that the&#13;
potential peace dividend presents, the Government has given high priority to the objectives of the&#13;
EDRP and to integrating demobilized soldiers into sustainable productive activities.&#13;
19.   As a precursor to a more detailed Transitional Support Strategy (TSS), the Bank finalized&#13;
an Interim Support Strategy (ISS) for Eritrea in November 2000. The ISS outlines the Bank's&#13;
assistance strategy to the Government in the transition to peace over the next 12-18 months. It&#13;
also identified the two immediate priorities: demobilization and support to macroeconomic&#13;
management. A major precept of the ISS was the GOE's recognition of the fact that&#13;
demobilization was crucial to achieving macroeconomic and fiscal balance.&#13;
20.    The conflict with Ethiopia led to the diversion of scarce resources from potentially&#13;
productive (agriculture, industry and basic social services) to non-productive (military) sectors.&#13;
The EDRP is expected to facilitate the reallocation of public resources from military expenditures&#13;
to productive and social investments. The demobilization will also alleviate manpower constraints&#13;
faced by the government and private businesses, and thus contribute to a resumption of critical&#13;
economic activity. The reduction of military spending will furthermore help ease the fiscal&#13;
deficit, and is thus crucial to achieving macroeconomic and fiscal balance in the longer term.&#13;
III.   Lessons Learned&#13;
21.    The preparation and implementation of the Eritrea EDRP builds on international best&#13;
practices concerning demobilization and reintegration and on Eritrea's own experience with such&#13;
projects. Some important lessons learned from international experience (Cambodia, Chad,&#13;
Djibouti, Ethiopia, Guinea-Bissau, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, and Uganda) include: (i)&#13;
the full transition from demobilization to reinsertion and reintegration needs to be supported in&#13;
order to achieve primary objectives; (ii) to facilitate sustainable reintegration, it is crucial to&#13;
provide a short-term social safety net to demobilized soldiers (i.e. reinsertion assistance); (iii)&#13;
information and referral systems can play an important role in linking demobilized soldiers to&#13;
existing employment opportunities; (iv) duplication of implementation structures should be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex           5&#13;
avoided; and (v) the creation of more viable long-term employment is closely linked to a&#13;
conducive macroeconomic environment and restoration of private sector confidence.&#13;
22.    Some important lessons learned from previous experience in Eritrea include: (i) despite&#13;
their rural background most of the ex-soldiers (80 percent) ended up in urban areas in search of&#13;
training or jobs; (ii) although 89 percent of the ex-soldiers aimed at upgrading their education,&#13;
only some 15 percent managed to do so; (iii) many ex-soldiers faced difficulties handling the&#13;
credit they had received; and (iv) the reintegration project component suffered from a lack of&#13;
funds and experienced staff. Additional lessons learned that have guided the design of the EDRP&#13;
include:&#13;
*  A socio-economic profile of the demobilized soldiers must be undertaken in the early&#13;
planning stages, so that projects and services are responding to the specific needs and&#13;
characteristics of those being demobilized. Important sub-groups should be analyzed&#13;
separately and in detail (such as disabled, women, younger demobilized, i.e. under 25);&#13;
*  More attention should be paid to the psycho-social needs and support services for the&#13;
demobilized soldiers and their families than was provided in the previous Demobilization and&#13;
Reintegration Project in Eritrea;&#13;
*  Reintegration projects implemented at the community level should be inclusive, providing&#13;
support for IDPs and other war-affected populations, as well as demobilized soldiers;&#13;
*  Follow-up and monitoring capacity is necessary to ensure that the projects supporting&#13;
reintegration can respond to the evolving and newly identified needs of the demobilized&#13;
soldiers, their families and communities; and&#13;
*  EDRP projects should be implemented, as much as possible, by line ministries and existing&#13;
projects or organizations, so as not to create parallel structures and implementation&#13;
arrangements. Capacity building to expand the delivery capabilities should be an important&#13;
component of the EDRP and will contribute to longer-term economic recovery initiatives.&#13;
C.    DETAILED PROGRAM DESCRIPTION&#13;
I.     Program Objectives&#13;
23.    The overall development objectives of the Government's Demobilization and&#13;
Reintegration Program are:&#13;
(i)    demobilize and provide reinsertion support to up to 200,000 soldiers, in a phased project&#13;
for a period of 18-24 months;&#13;
(ii)  support the social and economic reintegration of demobilized soldiers into communities&#13;
for a period of 3-4 years, including strengthening of institutional capacities of relevant&#13;
government and local implementing partners;&#13;
(iii)  support macro-economic stability.&#13;
II.    Project Costs and Financing&#13;
24.   The overall size of the project is estimated to be US$197 million, of which IDA will&#13;
finance US$60 million, and the Government and other donors will contribute the remnaining&#13;
resources. Table 1 provides an overview of the agreed cost estimates for the EDRP. The costing is&#13;

25.    Table 2 below, provides the prelimninary financing plan for the first phase and the overall&#13;
EDRP. The total cost for the first phase EDRP is estimated at US$71 million. Based on the&#13;
commitments of the Dutch government, the Multi Donor Trust Fund would be able to provide&#13;
US$5 million for the first phase of the EDRP. WFP would be able to provide the equivalent of&#13;
US$6 million in food assistance. It is expected that GOB and the donor community will provide&#13;
the resources for the second and third phase of the EDRP.&#13;

26.    Table 3 provides the planned allocation of the IDA Credit across program components.&#13;
The IDA Credit will finance US$3 million of the demobilization component, US$42 million of&#13;
the reinsertion component, US$12 million of the reintegration component, US$1 million for&#13;
operating and technical assistance costs. The IDA Credit allocation for reintegration is distributed&#13;
across the following sub-components: (i) Savings and Micro-Credit Program - US$5million; (ii)&#13;
Micro Business Development Services - US$2 million; (iii) capacity building and&#13;
implementation of skills training, rural development and special target group interventions -&#13;
US$3 million; (iv) public works - US$1 million; and (v) absorption into existing reintegration&#13;
programs and projects - US$1 million.&#13;

27.    The Government has requested that the World Bank establish and administer a multi-&#13;
donor trust fund to raise the grant funding from the donor community for the purpose of&#13;
implementing the EDRP. The Government recognizes that a trust fund for the EDRP would:&#13;
ensure a comprehensive response to the program; facilitate the involvement of donors that might&#13;
otherwise not be able to participate; minimize duplication of efforts and reduce the admninistrative&#13;
burden on government through the application of one set of implementation procedures. The&#13;
signing of the first Administrative Agreement between the World Bank and the Government of&#13;
the Netherlands, and the related Grant Agreement with the GOE are scheduled for May 2002. In&#13;
addition to the Dutch, several donors have indicated their interest in contributing to such a&#13;
financial mechanism and formal pledges amounting to US$65 million were made to the EDRP&#13;
during the September 2001 Partners Meeting in Asmara. Following the freeze on new&#13;
commitments for development assistance from the European Union and many of its member&#13;
states, in October 2001, these pledges have, however, become subject to delay.&#13;
28.    Activities under the social and economic reintegration component will initially be&#13;
coordinated and financed through the NCDRP. These activities will largely be implemented&#13;
and/or technically supervised by line ministries. Reintegration activities will be increasingly&#13;
financed directly through targeted components in existing, or forthcoming, government Sector&#13;
Programs, supported technically and financially by the donor community. These sector operations&#13;
are expected to be scaled up to absorb the demobilized soldiers and other war-affected&#13;
populations. Table 4 provides the program costs by cost category and proposed funding sources.&#13;

III.   Project Components&#13;
30.    The EDRP will comprise three main components: (a) demobilization, (b) reinsertion&#13;
(TSNs), and (c) social and economic reintegration.&#13;
(a)    Demobilization (Estimated Total Costs: US$9.3 million)&#13;
31.    The objective of the demobilization component is to reduce the number of military&#13;
personnel by approximately 200,000 over an 18-24 month period. This component of the project&#13;
will be carried out in three phases of 60-70,000 soldiers. The recently created Demobilization&#13;
Task Force (DTF) within the Ministry of Defense (MOD) has already started detailed planning.&#13;
The MOD and the National Commission will carry out a pilot demobilization of approximately&#13;
5,000 soldiers to test all procedures and processes.&#13;
32.    Demobilization Criteria. The definition of demobilization criteria is the critical first step&#13;
in the planning process. Phase I demobilization will cover special target groups (female, disabled,&#13;
over-aged and econornically essential soldiers) as well as soldiers of the general group (national&#13;
service, remobilized ex-soldiers, etc.). The inclusion of the latter group is essential to create and&#13;
strengthen the public and private sector capacities for reintegrating demobilized soldiers, as well&#13;
as for general reconstruction. The MOD will establish the criteria such that they are transparent&#13;
and clear and simplify the selection of soldiers for demobilization. Once the criteria have been&#13;
established, the DTF will identify the soldiers to be demobilized under the pilot phase and the&#13;
first phase of demobilization.&#13;
33.    Logistics Plan. Logistics will be undertaken in three steps. First, soldiers will return their&#13;
military equipment (weapon, ammunition, clothes, etc.) at their duty station. Second, soldiers will&#13;
be transported to discharge centers. Third, demobilized soldiers will be transported to their zoba&#13;
of settlement. The DTF will prepare a logistics plan to ensure the smooth processing of the&#13;
caseload during these three steps. Special provisions will be made for severely disabled soldiers&#13;
who may be demobilized directly from the medical facilities. The discharge process itself will be&#13;
as short as possible and will be limited to approximately one week.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex               9&#13;
34.   Information. Soldiers will be informed in advance of their pending demobilization to help&#13;
them make the necessary personal arrangements both at the duty station and in the community of&#13;
planned settlement. This information will include the approximate date and planned procedures of&#13;
discharge, the availability of an appeals mechanism, a basic overview of the EDRP, and an initial&#13;
preparation for the return to civilian life. Every effort will be made to avoid unrealistic&#13;
expectations regarding the project.&#13;
35.    Appeals Mechanism. Soldiers will be given an opportunity to appeal to a decision&#13;
regarding demobilization. Transparent criteria for demobilization are essential to this end,&#13;
allowing a soldier to assess whether or not s/he indeed meets the criteria for demobilization. An&#13;
independent appeals mechanism will be set up within the Ministry of Defense to this end.&#13;
Soldiers selected for demobilization as well as those not selected will have the right to appeal to&#13;
the decision of the MOD.&#13;
36.    Socioeconomic Data. While still at their duty stations, the DTF will collect&#13;
socioeconomic data on all soldiers slated for demobilization. This information will be linked to&#13;
the demobilization database and represent the baseline information for project purposes. A non-&#13;
transferable identification system will be required to ensure that only eligible demobilized&#13;
soldiers have access to benefits. A system of military and civilian ID cards is already well&#13;
established in the country. However, the requirements in terms of caseload and time are such that&#13;
a new, digital system will need to be employed to produce durable ID cards.&#13;
37.    Discharge Process. Given the magnitude of each phase, the discharge process poses a&#13;
particular implementation challenge. Discharge teams will be identified comprising both military&#13;
and civilian members in order to cover all aspects of the demobilization. The latter will be carried&#13;
out in specially prepared discharge centers. Existing facilities, whether military or civilian, will&#13;
serve as discharge centers. The discharge centers will be prepared to process a large caseload&#13;
within a short-time period. The discharge teams will assess the needs in terms of lodging, food,&#13;
health services, sanitation, etc. Separate facilities (lodging, sanitation, health services) will be&#13;
prepared for female soldiers. In addition, special facilities may be required for disabled veterans,&#13;
especially regarding accessibility. The "discharge chain" will comprise several steps, whose&#13;
sequence will be determined prior to the preparation of the discharge centers:&#13;
*      Arrival. Upon arrival at the discharge center, soldiers will be provided with basic goods&#13;
(soap, blanket, towel, etc.) for their short stay in the center.&#13;
*      Identification. The identity of each soldier will be verified using the soldier's military ID&#13;
card. The ID number will be compared with the computerized list of soldiers to be&#13;
demobilized.&#13;
*      Discharge Formalities. The exchange of a soldier's military ID card for his/her new&#13;
civilian project ID and discharge certificate symbolizes the termination of his/her military&#13;
service. As of this moment, an individual will turn into a "demobilized soldier" and will&#13;
be under the authority of the NCDRP.&#13;
*      Pre-discharge  Orientation. Pre-discharge  orientation  (counseling) will provide&#13;
demobilized soldiers with critical information about project benefits, implementation&#13;
arrangements at the central and zoba level, reintegration opportunities, health issues&#13;
(including HIV/AIDS, reproductive health, etc.), civic rights and duties (including&#13;
women's legal rights), etc. The orientation project will be organized in modules and will&#13;
be carried out by a mixed group of mnilitary/civilian staff. The DTF and the Secretariat&#13;
will identify counselors, who will undergo training. Special modules will be offered for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex             10&#13;
female and disabled ex-soldiers targeting their special reintegration needs. Special&#13;
materials will be prepared for counseling and distribution (booklets, job guides, etc.).&#13;
Again, every effort will be made to avoid the creation of unrealistic expectations about&#13;
project benefits.&#13;
*      Medical Screening. A special medical team will screen demobilized soldiers to identify&#13;
serious diseases or impairments that may affect his/her ability to enjoy economnic and&#13;
social reintegration (cough, chronic diarrhea, symptoms of sexually transmitted diseases,&#13;
alcohol and drug consumption, symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder, etc.).&#13;
Furthermore, voluntary counseling and testing (VCT) for HV/AIDS will be offered. To&#13;
this end, medical teams will be established and will comprise members from the&#13;
respective military and civilian authorities.&#13;
*      Transport to the Community of Settlement. The Secretariat will organize transport from&#13;
the discharge centers to the zoba level using public or private transport providers. For&#13;
continuation to the cormmunity of settlement, ex-soldiers will receive a transport&#13;
allowance as part of the TSN.&#13;
38.    Pilot demobilization. The MOD and the National Commission will carry out a pilot&#13;
demobilization of approximately 5,000 soldiers to test all procedures and processes. This pilot&#13;
will target general profile soldiers as well as special target groups. The lessons from the pilot&#13;
operation will be assessed and incorporated into program design before phase I demobilization&#13;
commences.&#13;
39.    Phase I demobilization. In order to manage the caseload of 60-70,000 soldiers and to&#13;
maximize the use of the discharge teams and centers, phase I demobilization will be undertaken&#13;
in batches over a period of 3-6 months. Each batch will comprise approximately 5,000 soldiers, to&#13;
be demobilized simultaneously from approximately 10 discharge centers (throughput of 500&#13;
soldiers per week per center).&#13;
(b)    Reinsertion (Estimated Total Costs: US$120 million)&#13;
40.    Transitional Safety Nets. Upon discharge, a demobilized soldier loses his/her source of&#13;
income and is normally in a critical financial situation until s/he can generate income through&#13;
(self)-employment. During this period (the reinsertion phase), a demobilized soldier is in need of&#13;
special assistance or a Transitional Safety Net allowance (TSN) to cover his/her personal or&#13;
family's basic material needs. TSN is the cash equivalent of a defined basket of basic goods and&#13;
services enabling the beneficiary family unit to re-establish a civilian household. The basket&#13;
consists of basic goods such as household items, clothing and cooking utensils and makes&#13;
provision for children's education. As part of the TSN, the World Food Program has agreed with&#13;
Government to provide up to 12 months of supplementary food support to vulnerable&#13;
demobilized soldiers.&#13;
41.    The TSN will consist of two components:&#13;
(i)    Basic transition support: The first component of the TSN will be a standard allowance to&#13;
which all demobilized soldiers are entitled. The basic transition support will, on average,&#13;
amount to US$600 per soldier. The $600 unit cost includes the in-kind contribution to the&#13;
reinsertion package by the World Food Program, which is valued at US$75. Therefore,&#13;
the cash contribution to the average reinsertion package that IDA and the Multi Donor&#13;
Trust Fund would finance would be US$525. The total estimated costs for reinsertion&#13;
amount to US$120 million (200,000 * US$600). The total cost for the in-kind&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex            11&#13;
contribution amounts to US$15 million and the total cost for the cash contribution&#13;
amounts to US$105 million. It was agreed with GOE that the basic transition support&#13;
would be differentiated into three or four broad categories based on rank and length of&#13;
service. Government prepared the criteria for this differentiation prior to Negotiations&#13;
with IDA. It was also agreed that the resource envelope for the basic transition support,&#13;
however, would not exceed US$120 million.&#13;
(ii)   Enhanced support to vulnerable groups: The second component of the TSN will be&#13;
made available to some demobilized soldiers based on relative vulnerabilities as indicated&#13;
by their health status. Health status covers demobilized soldiers with severe or moderate&#13;
disability and those with severe chronic illness. A medical commission of the MOD will&#13;
determine eligibility for enhanced support according to pre-determined and transparent&#13;
criteria. The total estimated additional cost of this support to vulnerable groups is $2&#13;
million. The additional support to vulnerable groups would be provided through the&#13;
social and economic reintegration component of the Program.&#13;
42.    Regarding the second component of the TSN, the following differentiation will be&#13;
applied:&#13;
*      Severely disabled will receive additional assistance (US$450, equivalent to an average of&#13;
9 months pay), totaling US$1,050 per soldier in this category; and&#13;
*      Moderately disabled and the chronically ill will receive additional assistance (US$300,&#13;
equivalent to an average of 6 months pay), thus totaling US$900 per soldier in this&#13;
category.&#13;
Demobilized soldiers who find (self)-employment immediately will remain eligible for specific&#13;
reintegration assistance (e.g. the provision of tools and seeds for farmers).&#13;
43.    TSN-payments. Payments will be effected in various installments. The basic transition&#13;
support will be paid in two installments, the first within one to three months of discharge, the&#13;
second four to six months after discharge. The enhanced support to vulnerable groups will be paid&#13;
in installments covering three months each. For instance severely and moderately disabled&#13;
demobilized soldiers will receive three additional installments, starting six months after receipt of&#13;
the basic transition support.&#13;
44.    TSN-payment procedures. Payments will be effected through the banking system with&#13;
demobilized soldiers being paid in their zobas of settlement. A managing bank will be selected on&#13;
the basis of cost and representation in the zobas. Installments will be paid by transferring funds&#13;
from the project account to the branches (via a central collection account at the managing bank)&#13;
for the credit of each individual bank account or payment over the counter to each soldier upon&#13;
personal and proper identification. As far as possible, ex-soldiers will be encouraged to open bank&#13;
accounts, which will also provide an incentive for them to remain in the zoba of initial settlement.&#13;
The use of bank accounts will have various indirect benefits, including banking education for&#13;
demobilized soldiers and their families, the contribution to rural capital fornation, and the&#13;
development of a decentralized banking system. Payment procedures will be clearly defined and&#13;
will be as simple as possible. Safeguard procedures will be applied to ensure transparency and&#13;
accuracy of the payment process. Complete and accurate payment lists will be prepared,&#13;
demobilized soldiers will be registered and be provided with a nontransferable photograph ID,&#13;
benefits will be tracked via the project's management information system (MIS), and regular&#13;
verification of payments will be undertaken through random samples by the zoba offices.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex             12&#13;
(c)   Social and Economic Reintegration (Estimated Total Costs: US$50 million)&#13;
45.    The social and economic reintegration of demobilized soldiers occurs over time. The&#13;
principal protagonist and the active initiator of the process is the individual demobilized soldier.&#13;
Support for economic and social reintegration may ease the process, but successful reintegration&#13;
is dependent upon a dynamic interaction of social, economic and political factors with the&#13;
returning demobilized soldiers. Family ties, community support, and economic circumstances and&#13;
opportunities play a critical role, and are taken into account in the design of the reintegration&#13;
support project. The design of the social and economic reintegration support projects is based on&#13;
the following principles:&#13;
(i)    Opportunities.  Reintegration projects are opportunities that the ex-soldiers choose to&#13;
access, unlike the reinsertion support (TSN), which is an entitlement. Some of these&#13;
opportunities may be designed in direct response to the needs and socio-economnic&#13;
characteristics of the ex-soldiers. Others may be services or projects provided by a range&#13;
of governmental entities, NGOs, banking institutions or private enterprises to the ex-&#13;
soldiers as members of the society at-large. In the case of disabled demobilized soldiers,&#13;
family members can substitute for demobilized soldiers, thereby protecting household&#13;
economic self-sufficiency.&#13;
(ii)  Inclusive Reintegration Supports. The EDRP is designed to be an integral part of the&#13;
broader post-war economic recovery process. Therefore, it is not only permissible but&#13;
also desirable that, internally displaced, returnees, deportees and other war-affected&#13;
persons be included in local level projects under the EDRP to promote community&#13;
cohesion and economic recovery. However, at least 50% of the program participants&#13;
should be demobilized soldiers. The EDRP, especially in the regions of Gash-Barka and&#13;
Debub, will coordinate closely with projects supporting the return and reintegration of&#13;
other target groups so that the assistance is compatible and mutually supportive. While&#13;
the EDRP reintegration assistance will be inclusive rather than exclusively provided to&#13;
ex-soldiers, some assistance may be specifically targeted at the demobilized soldiers. The&#13;
needs of female demobilized soldiers and the spouses of returning male soldiers are likely&#13;
to require particular attention.&#13;
(iii)  Capacity Builiding.  The lack of human resource and institutional capacity is a major&#13;
obstacle in all sectors to the expanded delivery of services and projects supporting the&#13;
reintegration of the demobilized soldiers. Therefore, each component initially needs to&#13;
implement targeted capacity building measures. These measures do not substitute for&#13;
longer-term human resource development and capacity building projects being&#13;
undertaken by the Eritrean Government with the support of various donors. Rather, they&#13;
are designed to unblock specific implementation bottlenecks in the proposed projects,&#13;
while complementing long-term ongoing projects.&#13;
46.   Implementation through NCDRP (US$35 million). Activities under the social and&#13;
economic reintegration component will initially be coordinated and financed through the&#13;
NCDRP. These activities will largely be implemented and/or technically supervised by line&#13;
ministries (e.g. Agriculture, Education, Fisheries, Labor, Local Government, Public Works, etc.)&#13;
in accordance with standards and guidelines applied for Bank assistance. Where feasible, the&#13;
NCDRP will finance the participation of demobilized soldiers and other war-affected populations&#13;
in existing programs. Where assistance to reintegration sub-projects cannot be channeled through&#13;
existing programs, the NCDRP will coordinate closely with line Ministries to ensure that the&#13;
implementation of these activities will fall within Government's medium and longer-term sector&#13;
strategies and policies.&#13;

47.   Implementation through GOE Sector Programs (US$15 million). Reintegration activities&#13;
are increasingly expected to be financed directly through targeted components in existing or&#13;
forthcoming GOE sector programs, such as the Education Sector Program (skills development&#13;
and training), Community Development Program (micro-credit), the Emergency Reconstruction&#13;
Program ('cash for work', rehabilitation of social/economic infrastructure), the Roads Sector&#13;
Program (public works), the Agriculture Sector Program (rural development activities) and&#13;
HAMSET (EIV-AIDS counseling). These sector operations will be scaled up to absorb the&#13;
demobilized soldiers and other war-affected populations. It was agreed that the absorption of&#13;
these target populations would have to be formalized in the project and legal documentation.&#13;
GOE and IDA agreed to channel US$5 million and US$2 million of the proposed EDRP&#13;
reintegration funds through the respective Community Development Program (CDP) structures:&#13;
i.e. the Micro Credit and Savings Scheme and the Micro Business Advisory Services scheme.&#13;
Since some of these sector operations will only become operational in FY03 and FY04, the&#13;
NCDRP will retain a level of financial and human resources sufficient to address the social and&#13;
economic reintegration needs of the initial batches of soldiers to be demobilized.&#13;
48.    Special Target Groups. The EDRP is placing special focus on three sub-groupings of&#13;
demobilized soldiers: female soldiers; those who have been disabled as a result of the war; and&#13;
HIV positive soldiers. A premise is that all three groups, and especially female ex-soldiers, have&#13;
strengths and experiences that will help facilitate their reintegration into mainstream social and&#13;
economic life. They will be encouraged and supported to pursue existing opportunities and&#13;
programs, and will be covered by the counseling activities under the program. The EDRP also&#13;
recognizes, however, the need for special support for the especially vulnerable through the extra&#13;
reinsertion payment, as well as enhanced reintegration assistance. This will include access for all&#13;
three vulnerable groups to: (i) specialized counseling strengthened by EDRP; (ii) assistance to&#13;
establish peer-support groups; (iii) strengthening of programs and facilities for medical treatment&#13;
and rehabilitation; and (iv) support from special programs in response to women's needs.&#13;
49.    Disabled soldiers. As the reintegration phase is opportunity rather than entitlement&#13;
driven, disabled ex-soldiers will be encouraged and supported to access existing programs. They&#13;
will have the opportunity to receive specialized counseling supported by EDRP, to help their&#13;
rehabilitation and reintegration.&#13;
50.    Specialist medical services and the first medical examination will be carried out before&#13;
discharge. The pre-discharge medical examination will focus on the type and degree of disability,&#13;
earlier treatment and needs for further treatment, rehabilitation and care. A special needs&#13;
assessment is required to determine capacity for further education, skills training and&#13;
employment. Disabled demobilized soldiers will be entitled to the same reinsertion package as all&#13;
other demobilized soldiers. In addition, some disabled will need additional entitlements,&#13;
according to their degree of disability based on needs assessment and earlier screening.&#13;
51.    Disabled soldiers will be assisted to access mainstream economic reintegration activities&#13;
such as business advice and training, credit schemes, employment and wage subsidy schemes,&#13;
agricultural support, and access to land. Some groups of disabled will need specific training to be&#13;
able to pursue certain employment opportunities. While community-based rehabilitation could&#13;
become an important support for the integration of disabled soldiers, the capacity of the existing&#13;
Community-Based Rehabilitation (CBR) Program will need substantive strengthening to be able&#13;
to meet the new challenge.&#13;
52.    Soldiers and HIV/AIDS. Based on the assumption that military personnel is a high-risk&#13;
group for HIV/AIDS, EDRP will be cooperating closely with the HAMSET project to implement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex             14&#13;
interventions to address HIV/AIDS issues among demobilized soldiers. An initial beneficiary&#13;
evaluation conducted by the government and the Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS&#13;
(UNAIDS) shows that there is considerable awareness among military personnel about&#13;
HIV/AIDS and especially the impact it has on communities. While still in the army, all soldiers&#13;
have free access to condoms. However, misinformation and misunderstanding still exist regarding&#13;
modes of transmission and prevention strategies. Denial and stigma are still very high, and affect&#13;
the degree of openness about the problem.&#13;
53.    NCDRP, in collaboration with MOD and MOH, has established an overall specialist team&#13;
to plan activities related to HIV/AlDS during demobilization, and sub-teams to carry out the&#13;
necessary preparations of the activities. The HIV/AIDS team will cooperate with UNAIDS in the&#13;
preparations, which includes a training-of-trainers (TOT) exercise. The following activities will&#13;
be undertaken:&#13;
(i)    all demobilized soldiers will be given extensive HIV/AIDS sensitization as part of the&#13;
pre-discharge orientation, and provided information materials;&#13;
(ii)   based on the sensitization sessions, all demobilized soldiers will be offered VCT&#13;
following a brief pre-test counseling session;&#13;
(iii)  all demobilized soldiers who test HIV+ will be given confirmatory tests and post-test&#13;
counseling.&#13;
54.    Medium-term health follow-up and support of the HIV+ demobilized soldiers and their&#13;
families will be organized within the framework of HAMSET. This will start in zobas where local&#13;
NGO capacity is available. In other zobas, solutions will be explored through the creation of local&#13;
capacity or by inviting national NGOs to develop activities. Apart from medical treatment,&#13;
follow-up activities will include assistance to community-based support groups.&#13;
55.    Female soldiers. Targeting of women soldiers and male soldiers' widows and spouses&#13;
will take into account the diverse vulnerabilities and capacities of women. These varying needs&#13;
require a flexible and diverse set of program responses. These include measures to ensure equity&#13;
and equal access of women to opportunities in order to maximize their economic capacities.&#13;
Certain program components will primarily enhance women's social, economic and political&#13;
empowerment.&#13;
56.    With these considerations in mind, the EDRP takes a threefold approach to gender:&#13;
*      Full integration of women in all program components. This means that provisions will be&#13;
designed and implemented so that female demobilized soldiers can have full access and&#13;
participation in all opportunities supported by the EDRP.&#13;
*      Given the history of (partial) exclusion of Eritrean women from many economic and&#13;
social aspects of life, program components will contain accompanying measures&#13;
(advocacy, sensitization) to encourage female participation and acceptance in the work&#13;
force. These could include interventions regarding numerical targeting, special&#13;
advertising campaigns, the promotion of role models and women's success stories, and&#13;
the offering of preparatory courses enabling women to acquire the skills and confidence&#13;
to enter regular training programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex            15&#13;
In addition, special programs will be developed that respond to women's needs that arise&#13;
from  intra-household and wider community gender relations, women's roles and&#13;
responsibilities in child rearing and livelihood strategies.&#13;
57.    The implications of this gender approach for the implementation of the EDRP are that&#13;
every implementing body has the responsibility to be gender aware, and develop and implement&#13;
accompanying measures. Within the EDRP, gender specialists will be responsible for: (i)&#13;
developing and implementing special women's programs, and (ii) training and assisting all EDRP&#13;
program and implementing bodies to be gender aware and responsive.&#13;
Social Reintegration&#13;
58.    Social reintegration deals with the issue of reintegrating groups with different&#13;
backgrounds, experiences, norms, expectations and capacities. The objectives of this component&#13;
are to facilitate the smooth reintegration of demobilized soldiers into their communities, and&#13;
contribute to continued social cohesion in the communities and in the society at large. A lesson&#13;
from Eritrea's previous EDRP experience is that social reintegration is a special challenge, the&#13;
importance of which is often underestimated. In the initial phase of the program the NCDRP will&#13;
assume an active role in strengthening the capacities of its partners to ensure that they will be able&#13;
to implement, coordinate and monitor program activities. Overall, an estimated US$6 million will&#13;
be dedicated to this aspect of reintegration.&#13;
59.   Information and Sensitization. To avoid unrealistic expectations and rumors about the&#13;
government's plans for demobilization and reintegration, the EDRP Commission is developing a&#13;
plan to keep the society-at-large informed through the media about the program at different stages&#13;
of implementation. In addition, local authorities and communities will be sensitized to the needs&#13;
of demobilized soldiers and their famnilies, and the opportunities and challenges of reintegration,&#13;
prior to and during demobilization. While general awareness on the EDRP process and its&#13;
challenges will be disseminated through mass media, further sensitization will be provided&#13;
through a series of workshops to the implementing partners: the key government ministries and&#13;
staff on central, zoba and sub-zoba levels; partner NGOs, e.g. National Union of Eritrean Women&#13;
(NUEW) and National Union of Eritrean Youth and Students (NUEYS); and the communities.&#13;
60.    First-line counseling.  This represents the first opportunity for ex-'.oldiers to get&#13;
counseling and support outside their circle of family and friends. The first-line counseling will be&#13;
provided in each sub-zoba by volunteers from the NUEW, the NUEYS, the Eritrean War&#13;
Disabled Fighters' Association (EWDFA) and the Ministry of Health, who have received courses&#13;
in counseling and community development work. The counselors will be coordinated and&#13;
supervised by the Ministry of Labor and Human Welfare's (MLHW) social counseling staff. The&#13;
MLHW will organize arrival counseling shortly after the demobilized soldiers have arrived in&#13;
their respective sub zoba/zoba. In addition to social reintegration of ex-soldiers, the counselors&#13;
will also assist reintegration of other war-affected groups, especially the internally displaced. The&#13;
minimum first-line counseling will include:&#13;
*      Basic counseling and advice: listen to ex-soldiers experiences and provide reintegration&#13;
advice; meet with community leaders/members regarding reintegration problems and&#13;
opportunities;&#13;
*      Information and referral: provide information and advice on availability and access to&#13;
specialized counseling and services; recognize needs for specialized counseling,&#13;
including signals of serious psychosocial problems;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex             16&#13;
*      Assist peer group and community activities: advise on group formation and peer and&#13;
community group activities in support of reintegration; help mediate in local conflicts,&#13;
e.g. on land issues.&#13;
61.    Outreach and community support.  Reintegration of demobilized soldiers and their&#13;
families will be further facilitated by follow-up counseling of demobilized soldiers in their&#13;
communities. To enhance community reintegration, this activity will include advice to and&#13;
support of peer groups and associations of demobilized soldiers, as well as community&#13;
organizations and international NGOs. The EDRP will have a budget for strengthening and&#13;
expansion of existing outreach and community support programs, and will be able to fund new&#13;
activities that can strengthen community social capital, e.g. adult education, sports and cultural&#13;
activities, through community outreach activities.&#13;
62.    Training offirst-line counselors. The MLHW has established counseling units in the six&#13;
zobas, and developed a training program for semi-skilled psychosocial counselors. MLHW has&#13;
already trained 24 women from within the National Service in this program, and will train&#13;
additional counselors through a training of trainers system. EDRP will contribute to strengthen&#13;
the country's counseling capacity by assisting MLHW to expand the intake at the training&#13;
program during 2002 and 2003. The country's first line counseling capacity will be further&#13;
strengthened by training of volunteers and staff of the NUEW and the NUEYS. It is anticipated&#13;
that such training will provide an average of 10 first line counselors per sub-zoba within a period&#13;
of two years, which will give the country about 560 first line counseling volunteers to help in the&#13;
reintegration of demobilized soldiers, internally displaced families and other war affected.&#13;
63.    Strengthening of second-line counseling. The first-line counselors will address many of&#13;
the problems encountered when ex-soldiers readjust to civilian life and pursue options to make a&#13;
living. However, there will also be a need for more specialized counseling in areas such as&#13;
psychosocial and family counseling; living with HIV/AIDS; the needs of the war-disabled and the&#13;
specific needs of women ex-soldiers and female family members of ex-soldiers. EDRP will&#13;
provide technical and financial resources to strengthen functional systems within the relevant&#13;
governmental and non-governmental service providers at zoba and sub-zoba levels as appropriate.&#13;
In preparation for this assistance, the NCDRP Commission will engage technical assistance to&#13;
assess the capacity and functionality of second-line psychosocial counseling services, and&#13;
develop proposals/plans for strengthening them.&#13;
Economic Reintegration&#13;
64.    The activities are designed to develop the financial self-sufficiency of a demobilized&#13;
soldier's household through productive (self-) employment. The Eritrea DRP will provide&#13;
economic reintegration assistance and access to employment through: (i) referral services on&#13;
employment, micro-projects, apprenticeship, training and education opportunities using the&#13;
system described under social reintegration; (ii) the provision of skills development and training&#13;
opportunities; (iii) access to micro-enterprise support schemes; (iv) support of small-scale rural&#13;
development activities; and (v) employment promotion and training in the construction trades.&#13;
Overall, an estimated US$44 million of total program will be invested in economic reintegration&#13;
activities.&#13;
65.    Demobilized soldiers will access the services in their region of return. The planning of&#13;
economic reintegration programs is guided by the socioeconomic profile, based on a key set of&#13;
variables, that is compiled for each demobilized soldier, and by a labor market information&#13;
system (LMIS). The LMIS is expected to identify the opportunities for economic reintegration&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex            17&#13;
into productive employment and self-employment in both rural and urban areas. The LMIS will&#13;
combine labor market trend analysis (enterprise surveys and tracer studies) with economic sector&#13;
analysis.&#13;
(a)    Skills Development and Training&#13;
66.    The Eritrean economy is seriously constrained by the lack of skilled manpower. Many&#13;
demobilized soldiers are likely to encounter significant difficulty entering the shattered economy&#13;
that has little absorptive capacity, particularly in the medium and large-scale formal sector. The&#13;
reconstruction of the country and the regeneration (and growth) of the economy will require a&#13;
training system that complements development imperatives, is market responsive and stimulates&#13;
increased production and enterprise, particularly in the micro and small sector. An estimated&#13;
US$15 million will be spent on skills development and training.&#13;
67.    The public and private technical education and vocational training (TEVT) system&#13;
currently operates below the quantitative and qualitative capacity required to provide the&#13;
demobilized soldiers with appropriate skills for formal and informal employment. The TEVT&#13;
system suffers from a lack of qualified instructors, insufficient and inappropriate equipment,&#13;
shortages of training consumables and technical textbooks, outdated curriculum, and the absence&#13;
of a national system of skills assessment and certification. Training and skills development, are&#13;
nonetheless, crucial to the process of facilitating the economic reintegration of demobilized&#13;
soldiers. The public and private training system will thus need to increase its capacity whilst&#13;
being responsive to the market. This sub-component of the EDRP anticipates activities over the&#13;
next four to five years in the following areas:&#13;
*  Increase entry to basic technical education and training by providing literacy and numeracy&#13;
upgrading for 70,000 soldiers before demobilization;&#13;
*  Increase institutional TVET provision at basic level over the five year period, to&#13;
accommodate an additional 10,000 trainees by regenerating the country's public Skills&#13;
Development Centers and assist existing, emerging and new private training providers;&#13;
*  Refocus basic training programs on the real skills needs for development, self-employment,&#13;
micro and small enterprise (MSE) development in urban and rural sectors;&#13;
*  Increase TEVT provision for 600 persons at intermediate and 400 persons at advanced levels&#13;
to accommodate the increase of graduates from the basic level; and&#13;
*  Develop alternative methods of delivery (such as distance education) and provide&#13;
mechanisms to improve and formalize on-the-job training (including apprenticeships) of&#13;
9,000 persons within the formal and infornal private sector, construction works, agricultural&#13;
and community projects.&#13;
68.    To take on the additional training demand resulting from the demobilization process,&#13;
public and private training providers will have to be supported in developing additional delivery&#13;
capacity. This will include: (i) refurbishing facilities and the purchasing of tools, equipment,&#13;
consumables and textbooks; (ii) developing the capacity to design training programs and projects&#13;
that match the skill needs of the economy; (iii) provide a national program to train trainers and&#13;
develop the capacity of training managers; and (iv) develop systems for labor market&#13;
responsiveness. Initially, public and private training providers can apply for financial support&#13;
through the NCDRP, however, once the Government's Education Sector Program becomes&#13;
effective, the training providers will need to apply for financial and technical support through the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex             18&#13;
Ministry of Education. The capacity building initiatives will, therefore, largely be channeled&#13;
through the upcoming Education Sector Program.&#13;
69.    NCDRP will further provide support for: (i) training fees and (and where applicable)&#13;
accommodation fees to individual demobilized soldiers; (ii) funding to groups, community&#13;
initiatives requiring specific training for projects that are targeted at defined employment and&#13;
economic opportunities; and (iii) incentives for on-the-job private sector training providers. Set&#13;
criteria will be applied to ensure that the increased provision and capacity will promote the&#13;
economic reintegration of demobilized soldiers, generate economic activity, support development&#13;
imperatives, and be sustainable in the long term. When designing, approving, and organizing the&#13;
implementation of its activities, the EDRP national and regional training specialists will work in&#13;
partnership with all relevant stakeholders.&#13;
(b) Micro Finance and Micro Business Development Services&#13;
70.    The EDRP will support the provision of credit and business development services to&#13;
demobilized soldiers and other low-income households through the Savings and Micro Credit&#13;
Program (SMCP). The SMCP is the continuation of the successful Eritrea Community&#13;
Development Fund's (ECDF) savings and credit scheme. The objectives of the Program are to:&#13;
(i) support the development of an appropriate policy, legal and regulatory environment for micro&#13;
finance; (ii) develop and institutionalize sustainable savings and micro-credit services for&#13;
demobilized soldiers, and (iii) establish micro and small Business Development Services (BDS)&#13;
that would support borrowers. The GOE and IDA have agreed to channel US$7 million of the&#13;
proposed EDRP reintegration funds through the SMCP structures. Demobilized soldiers would&#13;
have equal access to these services along with other members of Eritrean society.&#13;
71.    Micro finance.  The proposed program will seek to consolidate and improve upon the&#13;
previous ECDF micro finance activities that provide (i) smaller (1,000-10,000 nakfa) group&#13;
guaranteed loans to members of self-selected solidarity groups, and (ii) larger (10,000-100,000&#13;
nakfa) loans to individual borrowers or associations. An estimated US$5 million will be&#13;
channeled to micro enterprises, with an emphasis on lower income populations,. While the&#13;
existing program has performed well, the SMCP has not yet reached full financial sustainability.&#13;
Therefore, the extension of the SMCP will seek to improve performance by ensuring adequate&#13;
business planning, reviewing and revising loan products, improved financial management,&#13;
upgrading performance monitoring and the management information systems, increased staff&#13;
training and reviewing remuneration policies, and assessing funding strategies. These activities&#13;
would be undertaken within a context of an institutional transformation process to make the&#13;
SMCP an independent micro finance institution. The process of developing a strategic business&#13;
plan and reviewing program management systems will draw upon the CGAP Micro Finance&#13;
Business Planning Handbook and appraisal tools.&#13;
72.    Micro Business Development Services.  Despite the critical nature of business&#13;
development services (BDS) in the overall health and sustainability of micro enterprises, the&#13;
provision of BDS in Eritrea is extremely limited. Furthermore, the few dedicated support&#13;
services that have been provided to micro enterprises are done on a supply basis, and have been&#13;
heavily, or completely, subsidized. Based on best international practices and the lessons learned&#13;
in Eritrea to date, the BDS component will emphasize a demand driven and market approach that&#13;
would rely on basic services that are available or that can be developed in the private sector. This&#13;
component would support: (i) training of program staff and Advisory Committee members in&#13;
BDS best practices and micro-business assessment techniques, (ii) analysis of demand and supply&#13;
of business services, (iii) implementation of pilot support service activities, (iv) development of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex            19&#13;
operating and training manuals, and (v) establishment of independent monitoring capacity to&#13;
assess performance and impact of BDS. Among several suggested strategies for implementing&#13;
BDS that might be considered, are a voucher scheme and grassroots management training. An&#13;
estimated $2 million will be invested in this component of the program.&#13;
73.   Implementation Arrangements. Based on the progress and level of achievement of the&#13;
savings and credit scheme of the ECDF, Government took the initiative to establish the SMCP as&#13;
an autonomous unit within the Ministry of Local Government. The SMCP, established by&#13;
Government Directive in March 2001, is governed by a National Steering Committee, comprising&#13;
five members: a chairperson representing the Ministry of Finance, a secretary representing the&#13;
Ministry of Local Government and members representing the national Bank of Eritrea, Ministry&#13;
of Agriculture (MOA) and Ministry of Trade and Industry. The Government Directive further&#13;
describes the objectives of the program, SMCP organizational structure, roles and responsibilities&#13;
of the management Unit, the program manager, the Finance and Administration officer, and the&#13;
zoba and sub-zoba branches. The SMCP will work closely with local government structures in&#13;
the delivery of credit and services. A small BDS unit will be established within the offices of the&#13;
SMCP, will maintain separate accounts from the micro finance activities, and will have a separate&#13;
Advisor Group. A more detailed analysis of the micro finance sector and a discussion of the&#13;
objectives and activities under the SMCP are presented in Attachment V.&#13;
(c)    Rural Development&#13;
74.    The objective of the rural development component is to: (i) encourage and create job&#13;
opportunities facilitating agricultural production; (ii) encourage and develop the private sector in&#13;
rural areas, including the rural trade sector; (iii) support smallholder livestock initiatives; (iv)&#13;
improve opportunities in the fishery sector; and (v) design and execute upfront training to match&#13;
current needs in agricultural production and rural development. An estimated US$17 million will&#13;
be dedicated to this sub-component. Possible activities to be undertaken would include:&#13;
*  NCDRP will support 'cash-for-work' activities to meet the immediate needs of the landless&#13;
demobilized soldiers. These job creation initiatives could take the form of fixed-term&#13;
contracts of a period of 6-12 months. Works to be initiated through this initiative include&#13;
rural infrastructure construction, building materials, repair works on dams and construction&#13;
and rehabilitation of hand-dug wells. Rehabilitation of economic infrastructure will be&#13;
coordinated with ongoing programs of the Ministry of Public Works (MOPW) and ERREC.&#13;
*  NCDRP will build on the government's efforts to privatize the rural economy. The program&#13;
will support the establishment of a rural trading sector through the provision of training for&#13;
potential private traders and availability of rural credit. The Ministry of Agriculture is in the&#13;
process of delegating functions such as the distribution of seeds, tools, fertilizer and water&#13;
pumps directly to the private sector through an Agricultural Privatization Program.&#13;
Demobilized soldiers will have access to these types of opportunities through the program.&#13;
*  NCDRP intends to help restoring productive capacities in the small-scale livestock sector&#13;
through the restocking of small animals and through feed production. For this sub-&#13;
component, the NCDRP will link up with the Animal Resources component of the ERP. In&#13;
areas of return the program will support demobilized soldiers in accessing sub-projects&#13;
restocking poultry, bee-keeping, and improving feed supply. The Ministries of Agriculture&#13;
and Fisheries have initiated the use of dry fish plants at the Red Sea coast for animal feed&#13;
production.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex              20&#13;
*  In collaboration with the Ministry of Fisheries, the NCDRP will explore opportunities for&#13;
demobilized soldiers in the fishery sector. Seawater farming and artisanal fishing hold a&#13;
potential to supply the human diet and feeding domestic animals. Approximately 14 potential&#13;
sites for seawater farming have been identified around the coastline of Eritrea. The fishery&#13;
sector is at the moment under-utilized. In the year 2000 only 13,000 tons of fish were&#13;
harvested out of a maximum sustainable yield estimate of 50,000 tons.&#13;
*  Because of very limited capacity within rural Eritrea, EDRP will collaborate with the&#13;
Ministries of Agriculture and Fisheries to build training capacity through technical assistance&#13;
from international training specialists, NGOs working in Eritrea, and regional institutions. To&#13;
gradually strengthen capacity, the rural development component will be phased, starting with&#13;
cash-for-work activities and training inputs.&#13;
(d) Employment Promotion in the Construction Sector and Public Works&#13;
75.    With extensive assistance of the international donor community, the government has&#13;
initiated a comprehensive emergency rehabilitation and reconstruction programs. Since large-&#13;
scale ongoing rehabilitation activities are saturating the construction environment, NCDRP&#13;
support to this activity, at this stage, does not include any significant investment. The&#13;
employment promotion component will take advantage of ongoing and future construction&#13;
activities with three objectives in mind: (i) increase employment opportunities for demobilized&#13;
soldiers through identification of job opportunities and promotion in the construction sector; (ii)&#13;
improve construction skills and management capacities of demobilized soldiers and contractors&#13;
who employ demobilized soldiers; (iii) increase capacity in training and business development&#13;
infrastructure, and test preferential arrangements in hiring and procurement that would benefit&#13;
demobilized soldiers. The construction and public works activities, estimated to be worth US$5&#13;
million, will be coordinated with the Ministry of Public Works and ERREC.&#13;
76.    This component will promote the integration of demobilized soldiers who are new entries&#13;
in this market, as well as facilitate the re-entry of previously employed construction workers. In&#13;
addition, it will support skilled construction workers to develop small or micro-businesses, and&#13;
provide training opportunities for demobilized soldiers through apprenticeships. Particular&#13;
attention will be given to the large number of women who are currently employed by contractors&#13;
due to the massive mobilization of men for military service. These women will be included in&#13;
EDRP programs for upgrading or skills development to maintain their positions. This sub-&#13;
component will include interventions in the following areas:&#13;
*  Support employment referral centers to survey employment opportunities with private&#13;
contractors, and other related public works businesses;&#13;
*  Provide incentives to contractors for the employment of demobilized soldiers, targeting new&#13;
entries in the construction sector;&#13;
*  Support of training and capacity building, including business incubator and advisory service&#13;
provision, with specific eligibility criteria to meet the objectives;&#13;
*  Small scale investments in the rehabilitation, reconstruction and/or new construction of&#13;
training facilities;&#13;
*  Test preferential arrangements in the investments in training infrastructure works projects.&#13;
77.    Private contractors will in general implement the public works. GOE uses competitive&#13;
procurement procedures to hire contractors. The NCDRP will sub-contract the Ministries of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex            21&#13;
Public Works, Labor and Human Welfare, Education, and the Employers Federation, the&#13;
Chamber of Commerce and other relevant entities to (i) survey potential job opportunities in the&#13;
construction sector and provide updated information to the referral services; (ii) develop the&#13;
training and capacity building programs; and (iii) develop the incentive schemes as well as the&#13;
hiring and procurement exercises for small training facilities.&#13;
D.     INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS AND PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
I.     Institutional Arrangements&#13;
78.    The NCDRP has developed an Operational Manual (OM), which has legal authority by&#13;
virtue of the Proclamation #113/2001 establishing the NCDRP and as a covenant to the&#13;
Development Credit Agreement.&#13;
79.    This OM  describes NCDRP' s institutional set-up (see Attachment I) and reflects&#13;
procedures on decision-making in terms of sub-project identification, appraisal, approval,&#13;
implementation and progress monitoring, including procurement, financial and administrative&#13;
management procedures acceptable to the World Bank. Project management is being given larger&#13;
decision-making authority within specifically described procedures and eligibility criteria. In the&#13;
case of the Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Program, the objectives of this approach are&#13;
to achieve a wider variety of service delivery which corresponds better to local conditions and&#13;
which responds more to the local needs of the demobilized soldiers and their families and&#13;
communities.&#13;
80.    Demobilization will be carried out directly by the Secretariat in close coordination with&#13;
the DTF of the MOD. The payment of reinsertion benefits will be done through the banking&#13;
system. All reintegration support activities will be contracted out to implementing partners.&#13;
Project proposals will be generated by potential implementing partners, in close collaboration&#13;
with beneficiary groups and communities on the basis of needs in a given sector and geographic&#13;
area. Proposals submnitted to the NCDRP can be developed in one of two ways: (i) NCDRP issues&#13;
a formal Request for Proposals (RFP) for specific support services (the more supply-driven&#13;
approach); or (ii) through a social fund-type mechanism where eligible implementing agencies&#13;
identify an area of need in collaboration with target beneficiaries and present an unsolicited&#13;
proposal in form and substance suitable to NCDRP (the more demand-driven approach). The&#13;
approaches have been designed to encourage local initiative, to expand the participation of&#13;
potential service providers, to achieve outreach, to improve local institutional capacity, and to&#13;
enhance transparency and accountability. As local level capacity is weak in Eritrea, the NCDRP&#13;
will include institutional strengthening in most, if not all, of the subprojects resulting from this&#13;
mechanism.&#13;
81.    Performance monitoring is being measured against indicators such as efficiency,&#13;
effectiveness, cost, timely delivery - as well as beneficiary satisfaction. Transparency is being&#13;
achieved through process reporting and monitoring, including financial, management and&#13;
technical auditing. Accountability (financial, performance and impact) is being improved through&#13;
a "project-management" mechanism.&#13;
82.   In terms of the NCDRP's institutional set-up, the OM elaborates on the outlines provided&#13;
by the Proclamation and describes in practical detail the roles between the National&#13;
Commission's policy, strategy and performance monitoring function and the Secretariat's daily&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex              22&#13;
management role. The OM has been approved by the Nationa] Commission, which has thereby&#13;
committed itself to abide by its procedures.&#13;
83.   In terms of the NCDRP's activities, the OM covers the demobilization, reinsertion and&#13;
reintegration activities, and provides procedures on how to manage them;&#13;
*  Prior to demobilization, the NCDRP will receive data on the soldiers from the DTF in the&#13;
MOD. The NCDRP will also conduct the updating of the baseline data on the soldiers prior to&#13;
their discharge.&#13;
*  An identifiable demarcation line has been established whereby the soldiers become&#13;
demobilized soldiers and rejoin civilian life. This happens in the military discharge centers&#13;
where they return all their military apparel, including weapons, outfits, identification, etc. and&#13;
receive their civilian identification card. They are then moved to the civilian demobilization&#13;
centers, where the NCDRP provides them with various counseling services, as well as with&#13;
their first tranche of their reinsertion payment. All activities being managed by NCDRP&#13;
during the demobilization phase will be under the zoba offices direct control, and will be sub-&#13;
contracted to external service providers where and when required. These services could be&#13;
rendered by governmental, non-governmental or - although less likely in this phase - by&#13;
private sector organizations.&#13;
*  The reinsertion benefits will be made payable in accordance with the specific requests&#13;
expressed by the demobilized soldiers. The preferred system will be through bank transfers&#13;
onto the demobilized soldiers bank accounts. This would avoid requiring the Secretariat to set&#13;
up an elaborate system of check-writing and distribution, considering the enormous amount&#13;
of transactions.&#13;
*  Reintegration support will be provided to the demobilized soldiers and community members,&#13;
as they are considered to be delivered on an "inclusive" basis to achieve integration between&#13;
the demobilized soldiers and their communities. The ratio of accessibility to the services has&#13;
been set at approximately 1 to I between demobilized soldiers and the conmmunity members.&#13;
84.    The conflict and related mobilization, have further weakened institutional capacity. In&#13;
response, EDRP procedures require that special efforts are made to attract valuable initiatives at&#13;
the local level. Special outreach mechanisms are also being explored, to make services available&#13;
to more remote areas at reasonable cost and efficiency. In that context, NCDRP will put heavy&#13;
emphasis on providing institutional capacity building in many sub-projects. This can be on an ad&#13;
hoc basis, or be organized in a more centralized manner. A major objective of this component is&#13;
to sustain institutionalized services even after the withdrawal of NCDRP support.&#13;
85.    Zoba offices will be in charge of processing a sub-project cycle, as is usual in social fund&#13;
type projects. They will have authority to make all decisions, initially up to a threshold of&#13;
US$30,000 per sub-project. A sub-project approval committee will be set up for that purpose, in&#13;
close collaboration with local authorities. Sub-projects exceeding the threshold will be presented&#13;
to the Secretariat's national coordination office, where a similar, national, sub-project approval&#13;
committee will be created. This national commission can approve sub-projects up to a threshold&#13;
of US$200,000. Above this threshold sub-projects will require no-objection from the National&#13;
Comrmission and the World Bank.&#13;
86.    The Secretariat's national coordination office will be in charge of supervising the&#13;
performnance of the zoba offices, and accordingly will require the most specialized staff. It may&#13;
rely on the expertise of "institution capacity building" units established by the NCDRP, as well as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex            23&#13;
upon national and international technical assistance as and when required. The national&#13;
coordination office will provide guidelines on sub-projects to the zoba offices, which will become&#13;
"sub-project" profiles from which the zoba offices can develop the particular sub-projects in the&#13;
field. The national coordination office will provide more extensive technical assistance for sub-&#13;
projects above the zoba.&#13;
87.    All sub-projects, whether implemented by governmental, non-governmental or private&#13;
sector organizations will sign implementation arrangements under the form of contracts or&#13;
equivalent. These contracts will comprise performance indicators and evaluation mechanisms. All&#13;
contracts will include enforceable performance clauses, whether the sub-project activities are&#13;
financed by the TDA credit, the multi-donor trust fund, in co-financing arrangements or in parallel&#13;
funding arrangements.&#13;
88.    The Secretariat will be staffed with the best available Eritrean professionals. They will be&#13;
hired on a competitive basis, with TOR acceptable to IDA. Their performance will be monitored&#13;
and they will receive performance incentives after a period during which a staff performance&#13;
evaluation system will be put in place. Non-performing staff can be removed according to&#13;
established procedures. A large part of the Secretariat's activities will be sub-contracted to&#13;
consultants who will also be recruited on competitive basis and sign contracts including&#13;
performance-based clauses.&#13;
89.    All activities managed and/or monitored by the NCDRP Secretariat will be monitored in&#13;
a computerized MIS which will be purpose designed. For the MIS to be fully operational, it will&#13;
take up to 18 months, but the MIS starts functioning within the first quarter of operations of the&#13;
EDRP. Specialist local and international advice has been called in.&#13;
90.    The Secretariat's offices, both at the national coordination and the zoba levels, include&#13;
monitoring and evaluation specialists who will be in charge of organizing the monitoring and&#13;
evaluation of all activities. The M&amp;E will make extensive use of the MIS for the analysis of&#13;
M&amp;E data. The methodologies will capture both quantitative and qualitative information and will&#13;
include beneficiary satisfaction surveys as well as self-evaluation methodologies used by the&#13;
implementing partners. The M&amp;E unit will continuously draw lessons, using them to improve the&#13;
EDRP's operations and providing them to the National Commission for the annual policy and&#13;
strategy exercise. The lessons learned will be published and also transferred into the NCDRP's&#13;
institution building component. In addition, the M&amp;E unit is in charge of managing the internal&#13;
institutional capacity building of the NCDRP, which comprises the dissemination of the&#13;
operational procedures, including technical guidelines about sub-project profiles. The M&amp;E unit&#13;
will collaborate closely with the MIS unit for the training of all staff and implementing partners&#13;
(where required) in the optimal usage of the MIS.&#13;
II.    Financial Management, Auditing and Reporting&#13;
91.    Overall Program Accounting, Auditing and Reporting. The Finance and Administration&#13;
Manager of the NCDRP Secretariat will maintain records and accounts to reflect, in accordance&#13;
with sound accounting practices, the operations, resources, and expenditures of the program. The&#13;
Finance and Administration Unit will set up and maintain a program-specific accounting and&#13;
financial management system adequate to provide complete, accurate and timely information&#13;
regarding program resources and expenditures. Agreement will be obtained from all the&#13;
cooperating partners to harmonize the financial reporting for the program; in this regard, a&#13;
quarterly progress report will be distributed to all the cooperating partners as part of program&#13;
monitoring.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex            24&#13;
92.    Financing Mechanisms and Flow of Funds. The timely availability and flow of funding,&#13;
will be critical to enable the Government to implement the Program in a planned timeframe. In&#13;
the absence of a quick disbursement mechanism, implementation of the Program would likely be&#13;
slow. The Program will therefore use a quick disbursement mechanism, consisting of&#13;
disbursements in foreign exchange for purchases based on a positive list of imports. The local&#13;
currency proceeds from the sale of this foreign exchange will thereafter be deposited into a&#13;
Demobilization and Reintegration Fund Account to be utilized for the Program. The funds&#13;
disbursed under this mechanism will amount to US$30 million equivalent. Financial management&#13;
as well as disbursement of funds for the micro finance and micro business development services&#13;
will be under the responsibility of the Savings and Micro Credit Program (SMCP).&#13;
93.    At Effectiveness, the first payment made against the positive list of imports will be to&#13;
reimburse the GOE for the expenditures incurred for the program prior to Effectiveness&#13;
(retroactive financing). The second and third payment against the positive list of imports will be&#13;
based on a detailed project implementation plan (PIP) and actual progress in project&#13;
implementation (as measured through key indicators). The second and third payment against the&#13;
positive list of imports will be made when the Borrower furnishes to IDA evidence in form and&#13;
substance satisfactory to IDA: (i) consisting of a list of demobilized soldiers identifying the&#13;
amount of funds payable to the Demobilized Soldiers under the Demobilization and Reintegration&#13;
Program; and (ii) showing that a random sample of at least 2% of the number of demobilized&#13;
soldiers on the list furnished to IDA have (A) in accordance with the said list received the&#13;
amounts payable to them, and (B) acquired the goods and services intended for them under the&#13;
Program. After suitable verification of the disbursement and appropriate use of funds is received,&#13;
additional funds will become available to the Government. The other financing mechanisms are:&#13;
(i) a standard IDA Special Account to finance civil works and the procurement of goods and&#13;
services; (ii) a Special Account for the Savings and Micro-Credit Program; (iii) a Multi-Donor&#13;
Trust Fund to be administered by the Bank; and (iv) an account in local currency for counterpart&#13;
funding by the government.&#13;
94.    Safeguards would be built into the process in order to ensure that funds are utilized for&#13;
the purposes intended: (i) demobilized soldiers would be registered and provided with photograph&#13;
identifications; (ii) benefits would be tracked via a Management Information System (MIS); (iii)&#13;
regular checks through random samples; and (iv) annual audits of the Special Accounts,&#13;
Demobilization and Reintegration Fund Account, the Multi-Donor Trust Fund, and government&#13;
contribution would ensure appropriate use of resources.&#13;
95.    Special Accounts. The Program will have three Special Accounts, of which two will be&#13;
managed by the Secretariat. One will be used for depositing proceeds from the IDA Credit while&#13;
the other will be used for depositing proceeds from a multi-donor Trust Fund to be managed by&#13;
the Bank. Both Special Accounts will be operated in accordance with the Bank's operational&#13;
guidelines. In addition, a separate Special Account will be established for depositing proceeds&#13;
from the IDA Credit for the SMCP component. SMCP, as a partially autonomous institution will&#13;
continue to apply the financial management procedures and systems currently used under ECDF&#13;
financing. An appraisal of the SMCP financial management arrangements confirmed that they&#13;
are satisfactory to IDA.&#13;
96.   Auditing. The records, accounts and financial statements of the Program, including the&#13;
Special Accounts; the Demobilization and Reintegration Fund Account; the Multi-Donor Trust&#13;
Fund; and the government contribution will be audited annually in accordance with appropriate&#13;
auditing principles consistently applied. Audits will be conducted by independent auditors with&#13;
relevant experience and competence acceptable to the Bank. Agreement will be obtained to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex            25&#13;
prepare a consolidated annual report to satisfy the requirements of all the cooperating partners. In&#13;
addition to the audit reports, the auditors will also prepare a Management Letter giving comments&#13;
and observations, and make recommendations for improvements on accounting records, systems,&#13;
controls, and compliance with financial covenants. The annual audit reports along with&#13;
management letters will be sent to the Bank and all other cooperating partners not later than six&#13;
months after the end of each fiscal year. Joint Government/Bank supervision missions will make&#13;
spot checks to verify the use of funds disbursed.&#13;
97.    Retroactive Financing. The Credit will include Retroactive Financing according to the&#13;
Bank's guidelines for Emergency Recovery Credits. Retroactive Financing refers to the Credit&#13;
amount that the Bank agrees to reimburse to the Borrower for expenditures incurred during a&#13;
certain period prior to the date of Credit Effectiveness. The Government will be eligible for&#13;
reimbursement for expenses which it has incurred since December 5, 2000&#13;
III.   Procurement&#13;
99.    Organizational Setup. The commission's Finance and Administration Management&#13;
coordinates the activities. A procurement Manager, will oversee all procurement-related issues&#13;
under the EDRP. The Procurement Manager will also be responsible for carrying out and/or&#13;
establishing Procurement training. In the case of the large Zoba offices, depending on the&#13;
situation, a Procurement Officer may be hired to manage the procurement of goods and services&#13;
at local level.&#13;
100.  Procurement Planning and Implementation. The Procurement Manager will be&#13;
responsible for developing the annual procurement plans for the project. The presentation of: (i) a&#13;
detailed plan of priority activities for the first six months of the project; and (ii) a general first&#13;
year plan will be a condition of effectiveness. The NCDRP will coordinate closely with and draw&#13;
upon the extensive procurement experience and previously prepared documentation of the&#13;
Eritrean Community Development Fund (ECDF), ERP and HAMSET Projects. In addition, the&#13;
Government, with the Bank's assistance, has prepared a Manual of Procurement Procedures for&#13;
the NCDRP that will serve as the basis for project implementation. Standard Bank guidelines and&#13;
bid documents will be applied. Given the emergency nature of the project, the Bank has assisted&#13;
the Clients to select suitable, streamlined procurement methods that should allow for a rapid and&#13;
efficient demobilization.&#13;

Overall Procurement Risk Assessment: Fair&#13;
101.   Procurement Methods. The majority of goods required under the project will be procured&#13;
using national competitive bidding (NCB) and national/international shopping procedures, NCB&#13;
will follow national procedures which have been previously reviewed and found acceptable by&#13;
the Bank. Direct contracting, subject to previous no objection by the Bank, will be used only for&#13;
occasional national purchases, whenever there is only one qualified supplier of a good.&#13;
Procurement from UN agencies such as IAPSO will also be allowed as appropriate. Procurement&#13;
of works will be based on price quotation and community participation methods given the small&#13;
size of the contracts, and their location in remote areas. NCB is not anticipated, but will be used&#13;
for larger construction or rehabilitation works, and for all contracts (if any) in excess of $100,000.&#13;
Most consulting services are short term and for small contractual amounts and will be contracted&#13;
using qualification-based selection procedures. Finally, commercial practices and government&#13;
procedures, reviewed and considered adequate by the Bank, will be used for all of those activities&#13;
used in demobilization and registration practices for which conventional procurement methods&#13;
would be unsuitable. The prior review thresholds under the Project will be $200,000 for goods,&#13;
works, and $100,000 for consultant services with firms, and $50,000 for consultant services with&#13;
individuals. These thresholds may be updated after the first year of the project, based on project&#13;
performance. Bank no objection will also be required for procurement and implementation&#13;
schedules and for the consultant terms of reference (TOR) in addition to any proposed single-&#13;
source contracting.&#13;

IV.    Project Monitoring and Evaluation&#13;
102.   Project monitoring and evaluation will draw upon a comprehensive program MIS that&#13;
will link databases concerned with: socioeconomic profiles of former soldiers, reinsertion&#13;
payments, reintegration sub-project performance, and program finances. The MOD has recently&#13;
completed a socio-economic profile survey of soldiers to be demobilized during the pilot phase of&#13;
the program that will serve as the baseline for program monitoring and evaluation. These data,&#13;
which are critical for designing reintegration support, will be updated as demobilization is&#13;
implemented in phases under the program.&#13;
103.   Other elements of the MIS include: (i) multi-sectoral and multi-functional database on&#13;
employers, training providers, consultants, service institutions and training courses offered to&#13;
demobilized soldiers, as well as on artisans and small-medium scale enterprises willing to take on&#13;
demobilized soldiers as apprentices; and (ii) a regular reporting format, updated in part&#13;
automatically and that flags progress versus planning, actual disbursement versus budget&#13;
planning, requiring intervention and justification by various levels of management in line with&#13;
their levels of authority.&#13;
104.   The project implementation will be evaluated through    self-assessments by the&#13;
implementing partners, and through impact and performance surveys by project staff after the&#13;
completion of each of the sub-projects or activities. All evaluations will be entered in the MIS for&#13;
extensive analysis and to extract lessons-learned. The self-evaluations intend to stimulate the&#13;
implementing partners to achieve the objectives of their sub-projects.&#13;
105.   The success of the MIS will depend on the satisfactory performance of all those involved&#13;
in the collection, processing, and analysis of information. This will require extensive training of&#13;
staff of the Secretariat at different levels, as well as staff of implementing partners. Particular&#13;
emphasis will be given to the fact that the MIS is not only an information system but also a tool&#13;
for management and evaluation. A small but effective internal independent auditing team will be&#13;
in place to periodically check the accuracy of the data. Supervision and monitoring of sub-&#13;
projects and activities will be the responsibility of regional monitoring officers. The data will be&#13;
used to compile monthly computerized implementation progress reports in the MIS.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex                      28&#13;
106.   The Monitoring and Evaluation units of the NCDRP national and zoba offices will be&#13;
responsible for measuring project performnance against agreed performance indicators using the&#13;
MIS. A central tool in project monitoring are key performance indicators for the main&#13;
components of the project, which are listed below. They will be complemented by technical&#13;
performance indicators, including process indicators, to assess effectiveness of specific activities&#13;
under the NCDRP.&#13;
Program Phase                     Key Program Performance Indicators&#13;
Demobilization                *  Number of demobilization centers established and functioning in a&#13;
timely manner&#13;
*   Timely provision of basic services in camps (food, water and&#13;
medical screening)&#13;
*   Demobilization completed (including provision of ID, medical&#13;
screening and PDO) within 10 days per person&#13;
*   85% of ex-soldiers knowledgeable of medical and PDO topics&#13;

V.     Program Sustainability&#13;
107.   The program is designed to support the sustainable reintegration of demobilized soldiers&#13;
into mainstream social and economic life. The return to productive life by a significant proportion&#13;
of the country's labor force and the public savings incurred by reducing the armed forces are&#13;
expected to contribute in a major way to a sustainable post-conflict recovery and the development&#13;
process. Moreover, sustainability of the project is ensured through the design of implementation&#13;
and procurement arrangements that are consistent with long-term needs, and by including&#13;
sufficient resources for technical assistance and capacity building. Finally, the project promotes&#13;
sustainability by strengthening the capacity of existing institutions (Government, NGOs and&#13;
private sector) to implement reintegration activities.&#13;

VI.    Conditions of Effectiveness&#13;
108.  In the context of the preparation of the IDA-financed Phase I of the program, the&#13;
conditions of effectiveness were agreed upon:&#13;
(a) the Borrower has opened the Demobilization and Reintegration Fund Account;&#13;
(b) the Borrower has furnished to the Association the following plans in form and&#13;
substance satisfactory to the Association, namely: (i) a detailed plan of project activities to be&#13;
carried out, on a priority basis, during the first six month after the Effective Date; and (ii) a&#13;
general plan of Project activities to be carried out during the first Project Year;&#13;
(c) the Borrower has installed a financial management and accounting system for the&#13;
Project in form and substance satisfactory to the Association;&#13;
(d) the Borrower has adopted the Procurement Manual in form and substance satisfactory&#13;
to the Association;&#13;
(e) the Borrower has furnished to the Association the first Progress Report in form and&#13;
substance satisfactory to IDA;&#13;
(f) the Borrower has initiated the installation of the Management Information System in&#13;
form and substance satisfactory to the Association.&#13;
VII. Benefits&#13;
109.   The proposed project is designed to provide Government access to an adequate level of&#13;
financing to demobilize 60,000 soldiers and promote social and economic recovery following the&#13;
border conflict with Ethiopia. The major immediate benefits are:&#13;
(i)   to assist the demobilized soldiers to rebuild their livelihoods and resume productive&#13;
economic activities;&#13;
(ii)  to reverse the general slowdown of social and economic development due to the conflict&#13;
and the diversion of human resources into the military; and&#13;
(iii)  to contribute to economic recovery and fiscal stability through reallocation of public&#13;
resources from military to social and economic investments.&#13;
VIII. Risks&#13;
110.   External Risks. In case of a resumption of hostilities, the Bank would consider exercising&#13;
its remedies under the legal agreement. Even if the conflict does not resume, delays in the peace&#13;
process might result in delays in the implementation of the second and third phase of the Project.&#13;
However, the signing of the peace agreement by both parties to the conflict, the full deployment&#13;
of the UN peacekeeping force (UNMEE), and the recent acceptance of the Boundary&#13;
Commission's verdict reduce this risk. Suspension of new assistance because of continued&#13;
concerns regarding governance might jeopardize the financing of phases two and three. However,&#13;
in the context of the above positive developments it is likely that the Demobilization and&#13;
Reintegration Program remains a priority for Government and donor partners.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Eritrea Demobilization and Reintegration Project - Technical Annex              30&#13;
111.   Project-specific risks. As resources are fungible, there is the risk that project resources&#13;
are used indirectly for military spending or that savings from demobilization are not translated&#13;
into a reduction of military expenditures. However, safeguards with regards to financial&#13;
management, procurement and disbursement are outlined in the project documentation to prevent&#13;
direct abuse of project resources. Government expenditures will furthermore be monitored by the&#13;
IMF as part of its regular consultations with Eritrea and by IDA in the context of its assistance&#13;
projects.&#13;
112.   Given the limited human resource capacity in Eritrea's public and private sectors,&#13;
there is also the risk that the social and economic reintegration activities cannot be&#13;
implemented as planned. The NCDRP, therefore, will recruit highly competent staff and&#13;
focus on capacity building of implementation partners, such as government ministries and&#13;
NGOs. Conditions of Effectiveness also have been agreed on to strengthen institutional&#13;
capacities and further mitigate this risk.&#13;
IX.    Environmental and Social Aspects&#13;
113.   The demobilization and widely dispersed return of 60,000 demobilized soldiers to their&#13;
communities is not expected to have any negative environmental impact. However, the project is&#13;
classified as environmental category B because of potential, but not significant, adverse&#13;
environmental effects associated with the reintegration component. An Environmental&#13;
Assessment (EA) has been carried out in the context of the related IDA financed ERP, and&#13;
submitted to the Bank in October 2001. The EA for the EDRP will build on that assessment&#13;
which already covers major sub-components such as micro-credit financed under the SMCP,&#13;
infrastructure and agricultural sectors. This would allow for any necessary additional measures to&#13;
be built into this emergency project, thereby meeting the requirements for Emergency Recovery&#13;
Projects as stated under OP 4.01. The EA will be completed within six months of project&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
114.   All activities under the economic reintegration component will be implemented and&#13;
supervised technically by line ministries (e.g. Agriculture, Fisheries, Public Works) in accordance&#13;
with standards applied for other Bank Programs. Assistance to the micro-projects are, in addition,&#13;
expected to be channeled largely through existing Bank projects, such as the Eritrea Conununity&#13;
Development Fund and the Emergency Reconstruction Credit, which operate under Bank-&#13;
endorsed environmental guidelines. The project will draw on the expertise of the Ministry of&#13;
Land, Environment and Water, which has established appropriate environmental guidelines and&#13;
procedures and has institutional arrangements and qualified staff to ensure their use. An&#13;
Environmental and Social Data Sheet (ESDS) has been prepared for the project.&#13;

Attachment III: Financial Management Assessment&#13;
1.    Program Management.     The GOE has established a semi-autonomous NCDRP by&#13;
Proclamation number 113/2001, dated April 10, 2001. This will be responsible for overall&#13;
program management, including ensuring that financial management and reporting procedures&#13;
will be acceptable to the government, the Bank and other cooperating partners. A Secretariat,&#13;
comprised of a Commissioner, Deputy Comrnissioner and Secretary will be responsible for the&#13;
day-to-day affairs of the NCDRP and will also manage the program. The above three positions&#13;
have already been filled through appointments by the President. This core team has in turn&#13;
commenced the process of recruiting staff to assist them perform their duties. This includes the&#13;
key position of Finance Manager for the Program, which has already been filled. The SCMP&#13;
component will be implemented by the Savings and Micro Credit Program, an autonomous unit&#13;
within the Ministry of Local Government.&#13;
2.     Accounting and financial reporting. The Finance Manager of the NCDRP Secretariat&#13;
will maintain records and accounts to reflect, in accordance with sound accounting practices, the&#13;
operations, resources, and expenditures of the program. The Finance Unit will set up and&#13;
maintain a program-specific accounting and financial management system adequate to provide&#13;
complete, accurate and timely information regarding program resources and expenditures.&#13;
Agreement will be obtained from all the cooperating partners to harmonize the financial reporting&#13;
for the program; in this regard, a quarterly progress report will be distributed to all the&#13;
cooperating partners as part of program monitoring.&#13;
3.     Special Accounts.  The Program will have three Special Accounts, of which two will&#13;
be managed by the NCDRP Secretariat. One will be used for depositing proceeds from the IDA&#13;
Credit while the other will be used for depositing proceeds from a multi-donor Trust Fund to be&#13;
managed by the Bank. The third Special Account will be managed by SCMP and will be used for&#13;
depositing the proceeds from the IDA Credit for the SCMP component. All Special Accounts will&#13;
be operated in accordance with the Bank's operational guidelines.&#13;
4.     Auditing.  Accounts of the program will be audited annually in accordance with&#13;
appropriate auditing principles. Agreement will be obtained to prepare a consolidated annual&#13;
report to satisfy the requirements of all the cooperating partners. In addition to the audit reports,&#13;
the auditors will also be required to prepare a Management Letter giving comments and&#13;
observations, and make recommendations for improvements on accounting records, systems,&#13;
controls, and compliance with financial covenants.&#13;
5.     Next Issues. The Secretariat, under the guidance of the Commissioner, will complete the&#13;
following schedule of actions:&#13;
*  The recruitment of additional qualified and experienced accounting and support staff both at&#13;
the head office, as well as in the Regional Offices.&#13;
* The establishment of a financial management and accounting system, including a Chart of&#13;
Accounts, for the program. Towards this end, the Secretariat will set up and maintain a&#13;
separate, EDRP-specific accounting, budgetary, and financial management system. The&#13;
accounting system is a critical part of the project's financial management system and its&#13;
design and operation is therefore of great importance. This will take the form of computerized&#13;
accounting software to take advantage of advances in technology, as well as meet the&#13;
challenges posed by the program due to the volume of transactions. Management will explore&#13;
35&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
the possibilities of using consultants, both local and international, as well as consulting with&#13;
other Bank-financed projects in the country to achieve this.&#13;
*  Development of formats and contents of the various periodic reports that will be generated&#13;
under the program. The financial reports will be generated from the computerized financial&#13;
management and accounting system, and there will therefore be a link with the Charts of&#13;
Accounts noted above. The financial reports will include quarterly program management&#13;
reports to monitor program performance; annual financial statements detailing sources and&#13;
uses of funds by expenditure, and comparison with budgets.&#13;
*  Development of a Financial Procedures Manual documenting the operations of the financial&#13;
management system and to be used as a reference document. The financial and accounting&#13;
policies and procedures adopted for the program, including the flow of funds to the Regions,&#13;
will also be documented.&#13;
*  Development of a computerized database that will form the basis of the MIS to monitor&#13;
progress of demobilized soldiers, as well as provide essential data for the program. Using this&#13;
information, the Finance Unit will compile essential lists of entitlements of the demobilized&#13;
soldiers, analyzed by Region, etc. to facilitate payments of TSN and other future payments.&#13;
6.     The above schedule of actions has commenced before negotiations. Other required&#13;
actions include, the recruitment of an Internal Auditor to spearhead the proposed internal audit&#13;
function of the Secretariat; arrangements for the external audit of the program on approved TOR;&#13;
and opening of Special Account(s) in accordance with the Bank's requirements.&#13;
7.     Risk Analysis. The risk ratings below are showing low to medium mainly because these&#13;
financial management arrangements are not yet on the ground. Mitigating factors to address the&#13;
risks have been put in place. In addition, an action plan has also been agreed with the client to&#13;
ensure that acceptable financial management arrangements are in place.&#13;

8.     Country-Specific. Eritrea is a small country with a correspondingly small economy. The&#13;
recent conflict with Ethiopia, which this program is trying to address, has had a further negative&#13;
impact on the economic environment as well as the implementation capacity. Despite many&#13;
impediments to development, Eritrea has several significant factors working in its favor. It has a&#13;
very committed Government that does not tolerate corruption. It has also developed a spirit of&#13;
self-reliance which has permitted it to mobilize its people to put in substantial efforts to achieve&#13;
significant works at minimal cost.&#13;
36&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
9.     Entity/Project-Specific. A new entity, the National Commission for the Demobilization&#13;
and Reintegration Program has been established for the sole purpose of managing the&#13;
implementation of the program. The establishment of a semi-autonomous institution made up of&#13;
experienced professionals is a sign of commitment on the part of the Government to remove, as&#13;
far as possible, any impediments to the smooth implementation of the program. The use of a&#13;
project-specific financial management and accounting system will also address the weak financial&#13;
management and accounting environment currently found in the public sector.&#13;
10.   Implementing Entity. The challenges facing the new entity will be the lack of&#13;
experience in implementing Bank-financed projects. However, management is assembling a team&#13;
of competent staff, a number of whom have prior experience in implementing donor funded&#13;
projects. This use of a semi-autonomous institution with qualified and experienced professionals&#13;
to manage the accounting and auditing arrangements will ensure that this risk will be mitigated&#13;
once the right professionals are in place. The SCMP is familiar with Bank procedures from&#13;
implementing the savings and credit scheme under the Bank financed ECDF.&#13;
11.   Funds Flow. The program will use a quick disbursement mechanism, consisting of&#13;
disbursements in foreign exchange for purchases based on a positive list of imports. The local&#13;
currency proceeds from the sale of this foreign exchange will thereafter be deposited into a&#13;
Demobilization and Reintegration Fund Account to be utilized for the Program. The Funds&#13;
disbursed under this mechanism will amount to US$30 million equivalent. Other funding&#13;
mechanisms consist of three Special Accounts with the Bank of Eritrea (BE) in United States&#13;
Dollars to which the proceeds from the FDA Credit will be deposited; and related accounts in&#13;
local currency with a commercial bank to which draw downs from the Special Account will be&#13;
credited for program financing and administrative expenses; and an account in local currency&#13;
with a commercial bank to which counterpart funding by the Government will be deposited in&#13;
respect of any expenditure of the EDRP that may be provided for in the Development Credit&#13;
Agreement.&#13;
12.   Flow of funds to the Regional Offices and other implementing agencies will be very&#13;
minimal especially in the early stages of the implementation of the program. Payments for the&#13;
TSN and the Reinsertion component will use the banking system in the country to pay directly the&#13;
demobilized soldiers in their areas of settlement. While procurement arrangements will be&#13;
initiated from the community level, the Secretariat will, as far as possible, manage the required&#13;
expenditures from the head office, including international procurement.&#13;
13.   Staffing. A Finance and Administration Manager (FAM), with requisite qualifications&#13;
and relevant experience, has been appointed in order to direct and guide the financial&#13;
management operations of the EDRP. Additional qualified and experienced accounting,&#13;
administrative and support staff will be required to assist the Finance and Administration&#13;
Manager. The levels and numbers of such staff will be determined as a matter of urgency.&#13;
Varying levels of training will be required in financial management and government accounting;&#13;
information systems and computer applications; and procedures relating to use of funds.&#13;
Adequate staffing arrangements for the SCMP are already in place.&#13;
14.   Accounting Policies and Procedures. The FM will document the internal processing&#13;
procedures and controls for the EDRP in a Financial Procedures Manual.&#13;
15.   Internal Audit. An Internal Audit function will be established in the EDRP Secretariat.&#13;
This will be used as an independent appraisal function to examine and evaluate activities of the&#13;
37&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
program. Reporting to the Commissioner, the mission of the Internal Audit will be to support&#13;
members of the EDRP in the effective discharge of their responsibilities.&#13;
16.   External Audit. The EDRP will be a Government program and the Office of the&#13;
Auditor-General is mandated to audit all government programs, irrespective of the sources of&#13;
funding. In general, the Auditor-General has always sub-contracted this responsibility in respect&#13;
of donor-funded projects and has indicated his doing so in respect of the EDRP. In due course,&#13;
therefore, the EDRP Secretariat, in consultation with the Auditor-General and the World Bank&#13;
and other donors, will appoint independent auditors in compliance with the financial covenants&#13;
contained in the IDA Credit Agreement. TOR for the external auditor will be modeled on Annex&#13;
XIX, Financial Accounting Reporting and Auditing Handbook (FARAH) of the World Bank,&#13;
which contains "Sample Terms of Reference for the Audit of Project Financial Statements (and&#13;
accompanying SOE and SA where applicable)."&#13;
17.   The following audit reports will be required to be submitted to the Bank:&#13;
Audit Report                Due Date&#13;
Project              Six months after fiscal year end&#13;
SOE                  Six months after fiscal year end&#13;
Special Account      Six months after fiscal year end&#13;
Management Letter    Six months after fiscal year end&#13;
18.   Reporting and Monitoring. The financial transactions relating to this operation will be&#13;
recorded and monitored using a project-specific computerized financial management and&#13;
accounting system. The Finance Manager will determine: (i) EDRP's Chart of Accounts as well&#13;
as the format and content of quarterly reports and annual financial statements; (ii) the selection&#13;
and adoption of accounting policies and accounting standards; and (iii) the need to include any&#13;
supplementary notes to the project financial statements in order to enhance the presentation of a&#13;
"true and fair view." Subject to a decision being made, these reports will include financial&#13;
statements (e.g. sources and application of funds; expenditure classified by project components,&#13;
disbursement categories, expenditure types, and comparison with budgets.&#13;
19.   Information Systems. The development of a Management Information System will be&#13;
crucial to the smooth implementation and monitoring of the program. As a result, an Information&#13;
Technology consultancy will be required to set up the system, including the linkage between&#13;
financial and other information.&#13;
20.   Impact on Procurement Arrangements. A procurement assessment has been carried&#13;
out and concluded that EDRP Secretariat will be capable of handling all procurement&#13;
requirements at the head office.&#13;
21.    Disbursement Arrangements. Given that: this is an emergency program with a short&#13;
project implementation period of three to four years; the use of a transitional institution whose&#13;
mandate will finish upon completion of the program activities; the fact that 60 percent of the&#13;
project costs will be disbursed within the first two years of implementation to the approximately&#13;
200,000 soldiers to be demobilized; and taking the project characteristics and risks into&#13;
consideration, agreement has been obtained from the Bank's Loan Department to dispense with&#13;
the requirement for the project to attain the minimum requirements for PMR-based&#13;
disbursements. This, therefore means that the traditional disbursement procedures will be&#13;
followed throughout the implementation period of the program. However, the Secretariat wiUl be&#13;
38&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
required to prepare Financial Monitoring Reports (FMRs) to track expenditures for the&#13;
program.&#13;
22.    Action Plan. Detailed below is an action plan that will ensure that acceptable financial&#13;
management arrangements will be in place.&#13;

Though the Executing Agency (the Commission) has been created only&#13;
recently for the project, it can count on previous demobilization experience&#13;
of ERREC and on the support of coordination with other, experienced&#13;
executing agencies working under Bank-financing. In conclusion, the&#13;
Commission should be able to adequately manage and administer the simple,&#13;
but expeditious procurement under the project.&#13;

Attachment V: Micro Finance and Micro Business Development Services&#13;
Objectives, Budget and Performance Indicators&#13;
I. Component Objectives&#13;
The proposed micro finance and micro business development program will draw on experience&#13;
and lessons learned under the ECDF Project. The program will be aimed at developing a&#13;
sustainable business support system for micro and small enterprises. It has three main objectives:&#13;
A.     SMCP Expansion. Support the sustainable development and institutionalization of the&#13;
Savings and Micro Credit Program (SMCP). Here the program will address the expansion&#13;
of SMCP to provide sustainable micro finance services to large numbers of poor&#13;
households nation-wide, as well as the transformation of SMCP into an independent and&#13;
legally recognized micro finance institution.&#13;
B.     Business Development Services. Support the development of micro and small business&#13;
through both supply-led and demand-driven BDS initiatives that will be delivered&#13;
through existing local service providers - ultimately on a profitable basis.&#13;
C.     Legal and Regulatory Support. Support the development of an appropriate policy,&#13;
legal, and regulatory environment for micro finance. Here the program will specifically&#13;
address the legal framework for the transformation of SMCP, but within the context of&#13;
formulating government policy, and a legal and regulatory framework for micro finance&#13;
in general.&#13;
II. Budget and Performance Indicators&#13;
The following budget is proposed for the legal and regulatory component of the program:&#13;
A.     SMCP Expansion&#13;
A line of credit amounting to US$ 4.92 million is expected to increase the outreach of the SMCP&#13;
to 16,500 clients by 2004.&#13;
Since interest income is expected to cover all operating expenses, including capacity building, but&#13;
excluding technical assistance proposed under this program, it is suggested that US$ 4.5 mnillion&#13;
be allocated to increase the SMCP's loan fund and US$ 420,000 to cover technical assistance.&#13;
However, sufficient flexibility should be built into the program to enable it also to fund additional&#13;
capacity building, if so required. Table 1 illustrates the estimated budget breakdown.&#13;

Financial Performance Indicators&#13;
Table 2 provides an overview of the most common performance indicators used in micro finance.&#13;
business planning exercise. The targets must be set for each of the three program years, i.e. 2002,&#13;
'Assuming that SMCP will become increasingly self-funding&#13;
45&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
2003 and 2004. The MIS system must be further developed to enable SMCP to track most of&#13;
these targets on at least a monthly basis. It is important that the definitions of certain indicators&#13;
that SMCP currently uses be reviewed to reflect more properly the progress it makes towards full&#13;
financial self-sustainability.&#13;

B.     Business Development Services&#13;
An estimated US$ 1,97 million will be allocated to the BDS component and to cover the expenses&#13;
as illustrated in table 3 overleaf. It is not possible to be too prescriptive at this stage, especially on&#13;
the activities and expenditures in the second phase. It is proposed that these should be decided&#13;
jointly by the World Bank EDRP Task Manager and his counterpart in the Government of Eritrea&#13;
on the basis of recommendations from the managers of the BDS Unit and SMCP together with&#13;
the BDS Advisory Group. It is possible that not all the $2m budgeted for the BDS program will&#13;
be required, in which case a decision can be taken on wiring/transferring any funds surplus to&#13;
requirements to SMCP' s micro finance program.&#13;
46&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
It will be noted that the budget includes a line for technical assistance. It is recommended that&#13;
this is provided by a single consultancy firm, selected on the basis of a competitive tender, rather&#13;
than by one or more independent individuals. This will allow a necessary degree of flexibility,&#13;
e.g. in the choice of the best individual for a particular pilot project, and the provision of ongoing&#13;
technical back-up by email and telephone.&#13;

Performance Indicators for Phase 1&#13;
By the end of the first phase of the program, it is expected that the following will have been&#13;
achieved:&#13;
*  the BDS Unit will have developed comprehensive understanding of and substantive&#13;
competence in the market development approach to BDS and how it might best be&#13;
applied in Eritrea&#13;
*  the staff of the BDS Unit and the representatives of the Advisory Group will have&#13;
established an effective working relationship, together able to influence the growth and&#13;
future of BDS in Eritrea&#13;
*  the BDS Unit will have produced a strategy describing what will be done in the second&#13;
phase&#13;
*  this strategy will include an outline of the longer term future role of the Unit, including&#13;
recommendations on the most appropriate institutional 'home' for the Unit and to whom&#13;
the head of the Unit should be responsible&#13;
47&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Performance Indicators for Phase 2&#13;
The performance indicators for the second phase will be:&#13;
* a number of pilot projects established and initial evaluations carried out&#13;
* capacity to monitor the outreach, cost effectiveness, impact and sustainability of BDS&#13;
interventions established&#13;
* options for the future of the BDS Unit identified&#13;

            Eritrea - Emergency Demobilization and
            Reintegration Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overall development objectives of
            the Eritrea's Emergency Demobilization and
            Reintegration Project are to: 1) demobilize and provide
            reinsertion support to about 200,000 soldiers in three
            phases; 2) support the social and economic reintegration of
            demobilized soldiers, including strengthening of
            institutional capacities of relevant government and local
            implementing partners; and 3) support macroeconomic
            stability. This Credit , constituting the first phase of the
            Program finances the demobilization of 60,000 soldiers.
            There are three project components: demobilization,
            reinsertion support in the form of a transitional safety net
            (TSN); and social and economic reintegration. Activities
            under the first component include: assembly; identification;
            collection of socioeconomic data; pre-discharge orientation;
            and transport to communities of return. With the second
            component, demobilized soldiers will receive allowances to
            cover his/her personal or family's basic material
            needs. Additional support will be provided to demobilized
            soldiers with severe or moderate disability and those with
            severe chronic illness. The third component focuses
            attention on these vulnerable groups: female soldiers, those
            who were disabled because of war, and HIV positive soldiers.
            Activities include information and sensitization, social and
            economic information and referral services, counseling, and
            strengthening of social capital. Economic activities are
