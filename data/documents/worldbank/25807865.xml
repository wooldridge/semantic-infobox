1.    Administration of the Contributions&#13;
1.1   The Bank shall be responsible only for performing those functions specifically set forth in this&#13;
Administration Agreement and shall not be subject to any other duties or responsibilities to the Donors,&#13;
including, without limitation, any duties or obligations that might otherwise apply to a fiduciary or trustee&#13;
under general principles of trust or fiduciary law. Nothing in this Administration Agreement shall be&#13;
considered a waiver of any privileges or immunities of the Bank under its Articles of Agreement or any&#13;
applicable law, all of which are expressly reserved.&#13;
1.2   Each Donor's Contribution (collectively, the "Contributions") shall be administered in accordance&#13;
with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures, as the same may be amended from time to time, including&#13;
its procurement, financial management, disbursement and safeguard policies, its framework to prevent and&#13;
combat fraud and corruption and its screening procedures to prevent the use of Bank resources to finance&#13;
terrorist activity, in line with the Bank's obligations to give effect to the relevant decisions of the Security&#13;
Council taken under Chapter VII of the Charter of the United Nations. The Donors acknowledge that this&#13;
provision does not create any obligations of the Bank under the anti-terrorist financing and asset control laws,&#13;
regulations, rules and executive orders of an individual member country that may apply to a Donor.&#13;
2.     Management of the Contributions&#13;
2.1    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund shall be accounted for as a single trust fund and shall be kept&#13;
separate and apart from the funds of the Bank. The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be commingled&#13;
with other trust fund assets maintained by the Bank. The Bank, in its capacity as trustee, has legal title to the&#13;
funds deposited in the Trust Fund.&#13;
2.2    The currency in which the funds in the Trust Fund shall be held is United States Dollars (the "Holding&#13;
Currency").&#13;
2.3    Donors agree to deposit their Contributions in the Contribution Currency stated in their respective&#13;
Administration Agreements. In the case of deposits received in a Contribution Currency other than the Holding&#13;
Currency, promptly upon the receipt of such amounts and the accompanying Deposit Instructions, the Bank&#13;
shall convert such amounts into the Holding Currency at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date&#13;
of the conversion. Where deposits prove to be insufficient to complete activities as a result of exchange rate&#13;
fluctuations, neither the Bank nor the Donor shall bear any responsibility for providing any additional&#13;
financing.&#13;
2.4    The funds deposited in the Trust Fund may be freely exchanged by the Bank into other currencies as&#13;
may facilitate their disbursement at the exchange rate obtained by the Bank on the date of the conversion.&#13;
2.5    The Bank shall invest and reinvest the funds deposited in the Trust Fund pending their disbursement&#13;
in accordance with the Bank's applicable policies and procedures for the investment of trust funds administered&#13;
by the Bank. The Bank shall credit all income from such investment to the Trust Fund to be used for the same&#13;
purposes as the Contributions.&#13;
6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿3.     Accounting and Financial Reporting&#13;

and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions via the World Bank's Trust Funds&#13;
Donor Center secure website. Within six (6) months after all commitments and liabilities under the Trust Fund&#13;
have been satisfied and the Trust Fund has been closed, the final financial information relating to receipts,&#13;
disbursements and fund balance in the Holding Currency with respect to the Contributions shall be made&#13;
available to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Funds Donor Center secure website.&#13;
3.3    The Bank shall provide to the Donors via the World Bank's Trust Fund Donor Center secure website,&#13;

of internal control over cash-based financial reporting for all cash-based trust funds as a whole; and (ii) a&#13;
combined financial statement for all cash-based trust funds together with the Bank's external auditor's opinion&#13;
thereon. The cost of the single audit shall be borne by the Bank.&#13;
3.4   If a Donor wishes to request, on an exceptional basis, a financial statement audit by the Bank's external&#13;
auditors of the Trust Fund, the Donor and the Bank shall first consult as to whether such an external audit is&#13;
necessary. The Bank and the Donor shall agree on the appropriate scope and terms of reference of such audit.&#13;
Following agreement on the scope and terms of reference, the Bank shall arrange for such external audit. The&#13;
costs of any such audit, including the internal costs of the Bank with respect to such audit, shall be borne by&#13;
the requesting Donor.&#13;

4.1.   The Bank shall provide the Donors with semi-annual progress reports by September 30 and March 31.&#13;
The progress reports shall be provided with reference to the results framework agreed by the Bank and the&#13;
Donors, as such results framework may be reviewed by the Parties from time to time. Within (6) months of&#13;
the End Disbursement Date (as defined below), the Bank shall provide to the Donors with a final report for the&#13;
Trust Fund.&#13;
4.2    Any Donor may review or evaluate activities financed by the Trust Fund at any time up to closure of&#13;

and the Bank shall provide all relevant information within the limits of the Bank's applicable policies and&#13;
procedures. All associated costs, including any costs incurred by the Bank, shall be borne by the Donor. It is&#13;
understood that any such review or evaluation will not constitute a financial, compliance or other audit of the&#13;
Trust Fund.&#13;
5.     Disbursement; Cancellation; Refund&#13;
5.1   It is expected that the funds deposited in the Trust Fund will be fully disbursed by the Bank by June&#13;
30, 2021 (the "End Disbursement Date"). The Bank shall only disburse funds deposited in the Trust Fund for&#13;
the purposes of this Administration Agreement (other than returns to Donors) after such date to the extent such&#13;
date is changed in accordance with amendments made to the Administration Agreements of all the Donors.&#13;
7&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿Following the End Disbursement Date, the Bank shall return any remaining balance of the Trust Fund to each&#13;
Donor in the Holding Currency in the manner specified in its respective Administration Agreement on a pro&#13;
rata basis with regard to the total funds deposited in the Trust Fund by such Donor relative to the total funds&#13;
deposited in the Trust Fund by all Donors, all calculated as Holding Currency amounts.&#13;
5.2    Any Donor may cancel all or part of such Donor's pro rata share, and the Bank may cancel all or any&#13;
Donors' pro rata shares, upon three (3) months' prior written notice, of any Contributions (paid and not yet&#13;
paid) that are not committed pursuant to any agreements entered into between the Bank and any consultants&#13;
and/or other third parties for the purposes of this Administration Agreement, including any Grant Agreements,&#13;
prior to the receipt of such notice. In the event of a cancellation, the Bank shall return to the Donor its pro-&#13;
rata share in the Holding Currency as specified in the Administration Agreement; unless otherwise agreed&#13;
between the Bank and the Donor.&#13;
6.     Disclosure; Dispute Resolution&#13;
6.1    The Bank shall disclose the Administration Agreements and related information on this Trust Fund in&#13;

the Donors consent to such disclosure of their respective Administration Agreements and such related&#13;
information.&#13;
6.2    The Donors and the Bank shall use their best efforts to amicably settle any dispute, controversy, or&#13;
claim arising out of or relating to the Administration Agreements.&#13;
7.     Grants to Recipients&#13;
7.1    The Bank shall, as administrator of the Trust Fund on behalf of the Donors, enter into one or more&#13;
grant agreements (the "Grant Agreements") with recipients (the "Recipients") consistent with the purposes of&#13;
this Administration Agreement and on the terms and conditions set forth in the Grant Agreements. Grant&#13;
Agreements may be entered into up to the maximum amount of the Contributions that all Donors have agreed&#13;
to make available under the Administration Agreements between the Bank and the Donors.&#13;
7.2    The Bank shall calculate a fee each time funds (the "Grant Amount") from the Trust Fund become&#13;
committed under a Grant Agreement. Such commitment shall occur when such Grant Agreement is fully&#13;
countersigned (the "Calculation Date"). The fee so calculated by the Bank shall be based on the cumulative&#13;
total of funds from the Trust Fund committed under all Grant Agreements that have been fully countersigned&#13;
on or prior to the Calculation Date (the "Cumulative Grant Total"). The calculated fee shall depend on where&#13;
the Cumulative Grant Total stands as the Grant Amount is added and shall be determined in accordance with&#13;
the following schedule:&#13;
(i)    5% of any portion of the Grant Amount that results in a Cumulative Grant Total below or equal to&#13;
US$ 50 million or equivalent; plus&#13;
(ii)   4% of any portion of the Grant Amount that results in a Cumulative Grant Total above US$ 50&#13;
million or equivalent and below or equal to US$ 500 million or equivalent; plus&#13;
(iii)  3% of any portion of the Grant Amount that results in a Cumulative Grant Total above US$ 500&#13;
million or equivalent and below or equal to US$ I billion or equivalent; plus&#13;
(iv)   2% of any portion of the Grant Amount that results in a Cumulative Grant Total above US$ I&#13;
billion or equivalent.&#13;
Following each Calculation Date, the Bank shall deduct from the Trust Fund, and retain for its own account,&#13;
the fee as set forth above. Grant Amounts may not exceed the balance of uncommitted funds in the Trust Fund&#13;
net of the related fee.&#13;
8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ï»¿7.3    The Bank shall be responsible for the supervision of the activities financed under any Grant&#13;
Agreements. Subject to the consent of any relevant Recipients, representatives of the Donors may be invited&#13;
by the Bank to participate in Bank supervision missions related to the Trust Fund.&#13;
7.4    The Bank shall promptly inform the Donors of any significant modification to the terms of any Grant&#13;
Agreements and of any contractual remedies that are exercised by the Bank under any Grant Agreements. To&#13;
the extent practicable, the Bank shall afford the Donors the opportunity to exchange views before effecting&#13;
any such modification or exercising any such remedy.&#13;
