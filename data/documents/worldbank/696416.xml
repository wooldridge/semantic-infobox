STAFF APPRAISAL REPORT&#13;
JUDICIAL REFORM PROJECT&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
I. I   Together with a comprehensive stabilization package, the administration of President&#13;
Duran-Ballen in September 1992 announced a reform agenda aimed at redefining the role of&#13;
the State in the economy. Reflecting the Government's priority for controlling&#13;
expenditures, a new Public Budgets Law was approved in December 1992. This law&#13;
provides an important instrument to improve economic management and restructure public&#13;
accounting and control by incorporating all public agencies into a new unified budget review&#13;
and approval process, reducing earmarking, and giving the Finance Ministry greater&#13;
authority over resource allocation. To maintain revenue flows the Government aims to&#13;
sustain the sharp reduction in subsidies for publicly provided services and to increase tax&#13;
collections. Moreover, the Hydrocarbons Law has been amended to allow domestic oil&#13;
prices to reflect international opportunity costs. In addition, the Government's&#13;
Modernization of the State (MOS) Program- reflected in a law approved in December 1993-&#13;
-provides a framework for an incentives-based reform of the management of public entities,&#13;
decentralization of administrative activities, and privatization of public services. Downsizing&#13;
of the public sector to eliminate excessive personnel, consolidate overlapping programs and&#13;
expand efficiency is a key aspect of the program. The MOS Law also established the&#13;
National Council for the Modernization of the State (CONAM) as the agency charged with&#13;
managing the Government's modernization program.&#13;
1.2   As part of the poverty alleviation strategy, the Government of Ecuador has&#13;
developed a number of social programs that seek to improve the quality and access to basic&#13;
services With thirty-five percent of the population living in poverty and another seventeen&#13;
percent only marginally above the poverty line, most of the recent programs have explicitly&#13;
aimed at reaching the poor. Macroeconomic constraints on public spending have made it all&#13;
the more important that scarce resources be spent efficiently and with the greatest impact on&#13;
the poor However, lack of strong economic growth and weak institutions have limited the&#13;
ability to improve social conditions.&#13;
1 3   During the 1980's excessive demands on the budget, including growing subsidies,&#13;
coupled with a fall in oil prices caused persistent fiscal imbalances and rising inflation.&#13;
Periodic stabilization efforts led to cuts in real wages of public employees, reduction in&#13;
public investments and sporadic withholding of payments and wages. Unfortunately, these&#13;
efforts were not anchored by structural reforms to reduce permanently the size of the public&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
sector or lower subsidies to levels compatible with non-inflationary financing'. These short&#13;
term efforts have not been sustained and there has been a marked deterioration in the&#13;
delivery of essential public services including the judiciary.&#13;
1.4   In the 1990's, structural reforms have included an agenda to modernize the economy&#13;
through private sector development, public sector reform as well as improve social&#13;
conditions. One of the key objectives of the Government is to help create an enabling and&#13;
competitive business environment for the private sector and attract foreign direct&#13;
investment. On the critical path improving this environment is to strengthen the legal and&#13;
judicial systems. 2 The legal principles supporting the prevailing economic system in Ecuador&#13;
are based on the freedom to exercise individual rights and property rights. Protection of&#13;
these rights requires clearly defined rules of law and effective mechanisms to enforce them.&#13;
This would in turn provide the necessary foundation for a stable legal environment for&#13;
economic decisions to be made in a predictable way. In an effort to promote socio-&#13;
economic development, economic decisions should be based on economic criteria - market&#13;
efficiency and the realization of the growth potential in the economy. Economic risk can be&#13;
calculated, but uncertainties as to the legal framework and its enforcement should not enter&#13;
into such calculations. Such legal uncertainties do, however, play a major role in economic&#13;
decisions in Ecuador. The results of the 68 enterprises surveyed indicate that the judicial&#13;
system is considered to be the sixth most significant constraint to private sector&#13;
development.3  This environment affects the private sector as a whole.&#13;
1.5    The Government has included judicial reform as part of the modernization of the&#13;
state agenda. Public sector management as well as institution building are considered to be&#13;
priorities for Ecuador. The judicial reform program is consistent with the program to&#13;
modernize the state. The Government of Ecuador established a Working Group on Judicial&#13;
Reform which prepared an overall program for judicial reform encompassing all actors and&#13;
institutions involved in the administration of justice. This is a long-term program which will&#13;
take years to complete. However, the Government and specifically the Supreme Court has&#13;
requested assistance from the World Bank to implement the first phase of the program.&#13;
1.6    A judicial sector review was completed by the Bank in order to assess the current&#13;
state of the judicial system and provide recommendations for reform which were endorsed&#13;
by the Supreme Court as well as the Executive Branch. The proposed project incorporates&#13;
the main weaknesses identified in the sector review. To summarize, the judicial sector has&#13;
four major weaknesses which contribute to the deficiencies of the judicial process: lack of&#13;
administrative organization by the courts including the lack of appropriate management&#13;
techniques, professional staff and administrative procedures, an inadequate judicial&#13;

3   According to the survey, the most significant constraints to private sector development Ewere as follows:&#13;
political instability, inflation and price instability, lack of skilled labor, lack of infrastructure, high&#13;
level of taxation, functioning of the judicial system. regulatory constraints, access to credit. and lack of&#13;
scrviccs. In May 1993, the LA4TF division conducted a questionnaire survey to determine the&#13;
constraints to Ecuadorian private sector development.&#13;

infrastructure, inadequate availability of alternative dispute resolution; and impediments in&#13;
access to justice for the poor and lack of legal training available to lawyers, judges, and&#13;
students&#13;
1 7    Historically, the judicial sector has suffered from a lack of financial resources,&#13;
administrative inefficiencies and a growing case backlog This situation has resulted in the&#13;
sector's difficulty in meeting the needs of the private sector and the public at large. A well-&#13;
functioning judicial system should be accessible to the public providing efficient and rational&#13;
outcomes and providing adequate remedies. There is a widespread perception of the public&#13;
that the judiciary in Ecuador falls far short of these standards.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

2. JUDICIAL SECTOR&#13;
A. STRUCTURE OF THE JUDICIARY&#13;
2.1    The Ecuadorian judicial system is composed of the Supreme Court, Administrative&#13;
and Tax Courts ("Tribunales Distritales"), Superior Courts, Tribunals, First Instance Courts&#13;
("Juzgados") and the National Judicial Council ("Consejo Nacional de la Judicatura").4&#13;
There are also separate Juzgados that have special jurisdiction in areas of minors,&#13;
hydrocarbons, water, land, mines, military, and police which do not depend on the judiciary.&#13;
There should be regional tax and administrative courts in every province. To date these&#13;
courts function in only some provinces.5&#13;
2.2    The Supreme Court, located in Quito, is the court of national jurisdiction, and is&#13;
comprised of thirty-one justices including its President, organized into ten "Salas" for Civil,&#13;
Constitutional, Penal, Administrative, Labor, and Fiscal matters. As part of the&#13;
constitutional reform of 1992, the Supreme Court became a court of cassation and only&#13;
hears cases on matters of law, much in the same manner as an appellate court under the&#13;
6&#13;
Anglo-American common law system. This was done, in part, to reduce the caseload of&#13;
the court. These reforms may have inadvertently compounded the problem of delay since&#13;
there were five judges in each "Sala;" a decision which before normally took about three&#13;
months takes more than eight months after the reform. In order to correct this situation, the&#13;
1995 reforms brought back the number of judges in each "Sala" to three.&#13;
2.3    The Superior Courts have both appellate and original jurisdiction. In theory each&#13;
province is supposed to have a Superior Court, however this is typically not the case&#13;
because some provinces are so small that they must share a Superior Court with adjoining&#13;
provinces; that is the case with four of the twenty-one Provinces. Tax and Administrative&#13;
Tribunals are separate courts but are at the same level as the Superior Courts in the judicial&#13;
hierarchy, and depend upon the Supreme Court for their budgets.&#13;
2.4    The First Instance Courts ("Juzgados") deal with civil, penal, landlord/tenant, labor,&#13;
traffic, customs, administrative and tax cases. Every Province has a criminal and civil court,&#13;
but may not necessarily have labor, landlord/tenant or traffic courts. The Supreme Court&#13;
determines the number of judges and the territorial jurisdiction for the civil juzgados and&#13;
criminal tribunals, whereas for labor, landlord/tenant, and traffic courts the Supreme Court&#13;
delegates the Superior Court of that region to determine the number and territorial&#13;
jurisdiction of the courts. There appears to be no correlation between the number of courts&#13;
and the number of new case filings or population, however. For example, in Pichincha there&#13;
4   Tribunal Supremo Electoral is not undcr the judicial branch.&#13;
5   So far there are tax and administrative courts in a total of four provinccs.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
are twenty-one civil juzgados to serve over two million people whereas in Azuay there are&#13;
eighteen for only 600,000 people. Azuay had over twelve thousand new cases in 1992 while&#13;
Pichincha had about twenty-five thousand.&#13;
B. RECENT REFORMS&#13;
2.5    Ecuador has had more than eighteen constitutions since 1812, the most recent one in&#13;
1979. The 1979 Constitution underwent reforms in 1992 and 1995. In December 1992 the&#13;
judicial system experienced a major structural change. Constitutional and statutory changes&#13;
included. doubling the size of the Supreme Court, creating a Judicial Council ("Consejo&#13;
Nacional de la Judicatura"), redefining the jurisdictional role of the Supreme Court, creating&#13;
a new mechanism for the selection of judges, and increasing the judicial budget as well as&#13;
salaries These changes were the first significant steps to address some of the systemic&#13;
problems which have plagued the judiciary for years, and were aimed at creating a more&#13;
accountable administrative structure capable of addressing the pressing problem of delay. In&#13;
this way, the Ecuadorian reforms of 1992 mirrored similar efforts in Chile, Colombia, Costa&#13;
Rica, Peru, and Venezuela.&#13;
2.6   In February 1995, additional reforms to the constitution were approved by Congress.&#13;
These reforms were designed to depoliticize the judiciary and strengthen the mechanisms&#13;
through which civil liberties and legal rights are enforced. These reforms included: (1) the&#13;
replacement of a two-tiered constitutional control system, composed of a Court of&#13;
Constitutional Guarantees and of a Constitutional Chamber within the Supreme Court, by a&#13;
new, independent Constitutional Tribunal (2) the establishment of the "Fiscalia General de la&#13;
Nacion" (public prosecution agency) as an independent institution (3) the recognition of the&#13;
right of citizens to receive injunctive relief against unconstitutional administrative acts which&#13;
may cause serious or irreparable damage to them, and (4) the creation of the ombudsman&#13;
figure ("Defensor del Pueblo"). Other constitutional provisions mandating decentralization&#13;
of the judiciary and use of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms were passed by&#13;
Congress in late 1995&#13;
2.7    The appointment of the "Consejo Nacional de la Judicatura", responsible for the&#13;
administration of the Judicial Branch, is still pending more precise legal definition regarding&#13;
the method of appointment of its members and their responsibilities. The appointment of the&#13;
Supreme Court Justices would either continue to be the responsibility of Congress or&#13;
become the responsibility of the "Consejo " The "Consejo" would be responsible for and&#13;
could set fees for certain judicial services.&#13;
2.8    Despite these initial reform efforts, there is widespread recognition in Ecuador that&#13;
additional reforms are necessary to implement a complete modernization plan for the legal&#13;
and judicial system Accordingly, it will be necessary to reform the supporting secondary&#13;
legislation There have already been preliminary efforts to reform the Organic Law of the&#13;
Judiciary to implement some of the recent constitutional reforms and to introduce other law&#13;
aimed at resolving some of the judicial administration problems.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. BUDGET REFORMS&#13;
2.9    A recent statute established that 2.5% of the current net income of the central&#13;
government's budget (for the years 1994- 96) be available for the judiciary.7 Establishing a&#13;
rule that the judicial budget will be a fixed percentage of the national budget is a method&#13;
that has been utilized in number of Latin American countries, though it has been subject to&#13;
some criticism. Although the increase in judicial sector spending appears to have been&#13;
substantial, most of this increase simply reflects the rising rate of inflation during the 1970's&#13;
and 1980's. If the annual budget for the judicial sector is computed in 1975 Sucres,&#13;
expenditures increased modestly over the same period (1973-1989) from 121.4 million&#13;
Sucres to 197.5 million Sucres. In addition, most of the increase in the judicial sector&#13;
budget occurred during the period from 1973-1979 when the annual rate of increase was&#13;
approximately 7.6 per cent. In contrast, from 1979 to 1989 judicial sector spending&#13;
increased at an annual rate of less than 0.5 per cent.&#13;
2.10   The slow growth in real resources for the judicial sector has occurred in a period of&#13;
rising demands on the system. From 1982 to 1989, the number of cases entering the lower&#13;
courts rose from 102,708 to 130,702 for an average annual rate of increase of 3.5 per cent.&#13;
Over the seven year period real resources per case fell from 1,743 Sucres to 1,511 Sucres 8&#13;
While a decline in resources allocated per case might be an indication of increased efficiency&#13;
in the judicial system, there is no evidence to support this interpretation. For example, the&#13;
accumulated backlog of cases between 1982 and 1989 rose from 39,833 to 411,501. Thus,&#13;
while the system accumulated more cases, it had fewer resources to devote to each case.&#13;
2.11   In each year between 1990-95, the Government has increased the Judicial buidget. 9&#13;
However, the increase in the budget did not necessarily increase efficiency in the courts,&#13;
though it did provide needed resources to create new judicial positions, increase the salaries&#13;
of the existing personnel, and finance limited capital improvements.&#13;
However, computation of this 2.5% has become a source of controvcrsy within the Ministry of Financc&#13;
which intends to charge the judiciary with an allocation of the total foreign debt. If the funds are&#13;
measured in this manner, there will be less funds than before the constitutional reform.&#13;
8   This is a very rough measure, since the caseload figures are for the juzgados, while the expenditure&#13;
figures are for the entire system. There is some evidence that the largest increase in caseload occurred&#13;
before 1982 although data to confirm this are not available. In addition, all case load figures must be&#13;
viewed with considerable skepticism.&#13;
9   Despite these increases, the judicial budget has not reached the required 2.5'S, of the overall budget.&#13;

2 13   This reflects the commitment on the part of the Government to provide the minimum&#13;
resources for funding the judiciary. Of the approved judicial budget for the years 1990-95,&#13;
approximately 90% is used for compensation. In fact in some years, such as 1995, over&#13;
90% of the Judiciary budget is allocated to salaries and nothing is allocated to capital&#13;
expenditures. This has created a more competitive environment to acquire judicial positions&#13;
as well as improve the morale of the existing      --&#13;
judges and court personnel. This is one way to         1995 Breakdown of Judiciary&#13;

2.14   In addition to the increase in the salaries           6%&#13;
and overall judicial budget, the Constitution&#13;
now permits the judiciary to charge fees for its&#13;
services which could supplement the existing    '&#13;

decisive factor in the delays of cases, and as such does not constitute an area of focus in the&#13;

comparable public sector salaries.&#13;
2.16   Juzgados of the First Instance Civil Courts receive a monthly salary. However, in&#13;
addition, these judges receive a number of other types of remuneration throughout the year;&#13;
these additional remuneration's result in significant increases to the effective yearly salaries&#13;
of these judges.&#13;

2.19   The increase in the number of personnel in the Supreme Court was due for the most&#13;

of the Government to support the improvement of the functioning of the judiciary.'"&#13;
D ISSUES&#13;
1. Crisis in the Judiciary&#13;
2.20   The current Ecuadorian judiciary lacks modem institutional framework to ensure&#13;
private agents clarity, predictability and enforceability of the legal and regulatory principles&#13;
governing their activities. This inadequate institutional framework has placed constraints on&#13;
the judiciary which has had an impact on the volume and efficiency of market transactions.&#13;
One example is the reduced number of loans made by banks because of problems with debt&#13;
collection through the courts. Moreover, the disincentive to invest in the judicial system in&#13;
its current state adds to the perceived risks and costs of market transactions. Finally,&#13;
foreign companies, which already encounter barriers to entry, are likely to be further&#13;
discouraged given that the judicial system creates additional barriers to their operation in&#13;
Ecuador. It has been found that commercial cases can be expected to take up to six years to&#13;
be decided.'2&#13;
Howcvcr, even with the increase in the budget and the number of personnel, the supply of court&#13;
scrvices has not improved. As a result, additional reforms are necessary to improve the efficiency of&#13;
the judiciary. Buscaglia and Dakolias, Case Studies on time delay (1996).&#13;
12  The median time to disposition, Id.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
2.21   The problems in the judiciary also mean that the judicial sector cannot always assist&#13;
the economic initiatives by providing an efficient and fair forum for the resolution of&#13;
disputes. Frustration with the judicial system's slow rate of processing cases, coupled with&#13;
a belief that corrupt practices could adversely affect the outcome of a law suit has lead to&#13;
the public's loss of confidence in the administration of justice in Ecuador and has given rise&#13;
to litigants' reliance on extra-judicial means to resolve their disputes. As the judiciary has&#13;
proven itself incapable of meeting the demands and needs of the private sector, companies,&#13;
both international and national, which have the resources, primarily rely upon negotiation or&#13;
arbitration to avoid the inefficient judicial system. Negotiation enables parties to go to the&#13;
heart of the conflict for speedy resolution. However, negotiation has its limitations. In&#13;
many cases, parties avoid using the system to the point where they forgo legitimate claims&#13;
and shoulder substantial losses rather than submit a dispute to judicial adjudication. When&#13;
there is a necessity to execute a negotiated agreement or there are legal principles involved,&#13;
the judicial process becomes essential to resolve these issues. Unfortunately, the judicial&#13;
system, in its present state, is not the viable alternative that the public would like and need it&#13;
to be.'.&#13;
2.22   The current problems that face the judiciary may negatively affect equity and social&#13;
welfare. This can indirectly produce bias toward new entrants such as small scale&#13;
entrepreneurs and foreign investors. As a result, the judicial system, in its present state, can&#13;
exacerbate the already existing social inequities in society. Litigants can also contribute to&#13;
these inequities by attempting to create bias in favor of the wrongdoer, for whom the&#13;
marginal benefit of influencing the judicial outcome is always higher.&#13;
2.23   The judicial system is currently faced with a tremendous backlog of cases and&#13;
excessive centralization of court administration; these create inefficiency and decrease&#13;
access to justice by the public. This inefficiency is also caused by the lack of legal and&#13;
judicial training and by the fact that some judges in the provinces do not even receive the&#13;
official gazette that is published daily. Factors contributing to these problems include low&#13;
employment standards and no incentive for court employees to move cases through the&#13;
system efficiently.&#13;
2. Delays in the Judiciary&#13;
2.24   In Ecuador's two largest cities, Quito and Guayaquil, delays are by the worst in the&#13;
country and at every level of the system, from the First Instance courts right up to the&#13;
Supreme Court. Since the late 1970s, the populations in the cities of Quito and Guayaquil&#13;
have doubled, and the number of case filings have similarly increased. By contrast, the&#13;
number of civil and commercial judges in those cities did not increase until just recently.&#13;
Moreover, delay in resolving cases has reached unprecedented times. Recent statistics&#13;
indicate that the Supreme Court has a 12,000 case backlog, with 7,000 of those cases in the&#13;
Civil Sala alone. 14 Fewer cases are resolved in a year than the total number of cases that&#13;

enter the system in that year. One source estimates that there are 500,022 cases backlogged&#13;
in the whole judicial system."&#13;
2.25   Although the number of cases filed in Quito and Guayaquil has increased, the&#13;
number of cases resolved has not increased at the same rate. This situation causes the&#13;
number of cases pending to increase exponentially. 16&#13;

1815 in Guayaquil and the number of cases resolved were 164 and 276 respectively. 18 This&#13;
same study found that case management and information technolo,gy is significantly&#13;
correlated to the time needed to resolve a case in Ecuador.&#13;
2 27   The sizable backlogs in the courts contribute to and will cause further delays in&#13;
justice administration. Although the laws specify time limits for different phases of a trial to&#13;
be completed, these time limitations are regularly ignored. In addition, parties have a&#13;
tendency to appeal every case.'9 These delays combined with the wide interpretation of and&#13;
changes to the laws provides an incentive for corruptive behavior and leads to abuses of the&#13;
system.&#13;

3. Court and Case Administration&#13;
2.28   At the national level, an important reason for the inefficient service provided by the&#13;
judiciary is that the administration of the courts is overly centralized. Judges have&#13;
administrative as well as judicial responsibilities which interfere with their role as judge: lack&#13;
of adequate case management which contributes to delays, there is poor planning and&#13;
budgetary management; the system provides for low employment standards, and no&#13;
incentives for court employees to move cases through the system efficiently; and court&#13;
personnel do not have access to adequate court procedures and technology to carry out&#13;
their work in an efficient manner. In addition, the administration of cases is poor which&#13;
prevents cases from being tracked through the process until disposition.&#13;
2.29   The lack of a well defined caseflow management system in which cases are actively&#13;
managed from filing to disposition is a serious problem in the Ecuadorian judiciary. The&#13;
concept that judges are managers of their caseload as well as resolvers of disputes is not&#13;
integrated into the management of the Ecuadorian system. There is a contradiction in this&#13;
fact as, as managers of large staffs, the typical judge in the Ecuadorian system has&#13;
significantly greater management responsibility than equivalent judicial authorities in the&#13;
other systems.&#13;
2.30   Moreover, the records management system that is in place in Ecuador is not clearly&#13;
defined and does not adhere to any national standards. In practice, each court uses its own&#13;
numbering system and there is no standardization on critical issues such as control of access&#13;
to files and disposition of records. Case files are usually maintained in the traditional Latin&#13;
American manner of sewing the case files together and then sewing additional papers into&#13;
the case file. The result is that case files are often lost and valuable space is taken up by&#13;
dead records.&#13;
2.31  Ecuador lacks the management information system on which to base decisions&#13;
related to both the administration of the system and the management of the flow of cases.&#13;
Reports on filings and dispositions are not systematically kept by the courts as required by&#13;
law. Even when the reports are submitted, they are not always reliable or complete.&#13;
Moreover, there is no auditing to ensure that the information is accurate, nor is the&#13;
information summarized into annual reports. Finally, the rules for maintaining the data are&#13;
unclear and interpreted differently from court to court. As a result, there is little faith in the&#13;
accuracy of the system and the statistical system is not used when decisions are made&#13;
regarding the allocation of personnel and infrastructure. In reality, allocation of new courts&#13;
and personnel is not based on rational criteria as with an analysis of workload.&#13;
2.32   Currently, most courts in Ecuador are not automated. Rather, caseflow is managed&#13;
manually. While there has been an effort to install some personal computers, the number of&#13;
computers in the system as a whole is nominal. The information systems office in the&#13;
national office consists of only six people and four of them have been lent to other&#13;
departments of the court. Furthermore, no one in the Information Technology Department&#13;
has a programming background. As a consequence, little management information on the&#13;
judicial and administrative processes is available and the benefits of automation in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
developing and maintaining tickler systems, calendars, and case histories are not available&#13;
However, the courts that have computers operate more efficiently&#13;
2 33   A major problem for the public using the court system is the difficulty in accessing&#13;
information about where the case is filed, status of cases and other vital case information&#13;
The project will focus on using modern technology to make case related information&#13;
available to the public in a readily accessible manner.&#13;
2 34  In addition to the lack of automation, the judges and employees lack basic&#13;
information necessary for their work The courts no longer receive the official gazette&#13;
("Registro Oficial") which is basic to the work of which laws are in force Ecuador has a&#13;
LEXIS service which provides up to date information on the codes, but the courts do not&#13;
have access to this service&#13;
4. Infrastructure&#13;
2.35   The physical facilities of the judicial system are largely outdated and therefore unable&#13;
to contribute to the effective administration of justice The image of the judicial branch of&#13;
government by the public, the judges and the functionaries, is greatly influenced by the&#13;
condition of the buildings in which the branch functions. Besides a significant shortage of&#13;
office space, there is a lack of modern office technology, telecommunications, printing&#13;
services, and modern archiving. In Ecuador, increased caseloads, security issues, the&#13;
movement toward oral hearings, and the decentralization of administrative functions is&#13;
creating a series of design problems that must be addressed.&#13;
2 36   Because of several factors, capital investment in infrastructure has been low in&#13;
recent years There is an overall shortage of funds. In 1995, the Court requested US $&#13;
12 5 million for capital improvements and infrastructure equipment and did not receive any&#13;
funding Secondly, because of the expenditures in other sectors of the budget, namely salary&#13;
increases, the funds that were approved for capital and infrastructure budgets were diverted&#13;
to pay operating budget costs.&#13;
2.37   Currently, the Supreme Court is housed in cramped quarters that were not designed&#13;
for a court of 31 magistrates. In fact, many of the juzgados for Quito are housed in&#13;
commercial buildings throughout the city that were not even designed for judicial branch&#13;
use. Many of the court facilities are housed in buildings which were not designed for court&#13;
use and reflect the functioning of the judicial system in a lower volume, more symbolic era&#13;
and do not work well in today's high volume, resolution oriented system.&#13;
5. Alternative Dispute Resolution Mechanisms&#13;
2 38   While alternative dispute resolution mechanisms (ADR) are available in Ecuador,&#13;
these mechanisms are limited and are not widely used by the public thus forcing the parties&#13;
into the formal system to resolve disputes if simple negotiation fails At the moment ADR&#13;
mechanisms are available in the judicial system under the Civil Procedural Code, and outside&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
the judicial system in the Chamber of Commerce 2" and in the Ministry of Labor ADR in&#13;
labor disputes has proven to be very successfil and have assisted in decreasing the backlogs&#13;
There is no training for mediators or arbitrators nor any recognized professional standards.&#13;
ADR can provide a speedy, informal and confidential way for parties to settle their disputes.&#13;
Consequently, the expansion of ADR combined with the increased public awareness of and&#13;
access to these mechanisms is another means to redress the inefficiencies in the judicial&#13;
system and to secure the prompt and fair resolution of disputes in Ecuador.&#13;
6. Access to Justice&#13;
2.39   The current number of public defenders and legal aid programs is wholly inadequate&#13;
to meet the demand for legal representation. While the Constitution under Article 107&#13;
provides public defenders in all types of cases for defendants who lack the economic means&#13;
to hire an attorney on their own, there are only twenty-one public defenders in all of&#13;
Ecuador.2' There are four public defenders in both Quito and Guayaquil where there are&#13;
two million and three million people, respectively Therefore, even if a defendant knows of&#13;
his/her right to a public defender, one may not be available. In fact, there is a long waiting&#13;
list for those requesting the assistance of a public defender. This situation creates great&#13;
hardship on those who cannot obtain a public defender as well as huge caseloads for the&#13;
public defenders themselves. This is exacerbated by the fact that thirty-five percent of the&#13;
population in Ecuador lives in poverty. 22&#13;
2.40   Obviously the people who are not able to use a public defender because the supply is&#13;
so inadequate are being denied access to justice. However, so too are the people who use a&#13;
public defender and inevitably experience delays in the resolution of their case because of&#13;
the public defender's overburdened caseload. The consequences of this shortfall are&#13;
exacerbated by the fact that for cases to proceed to court, legal representation is required in&#13;
Ecuador&#13;
2.41   Although the constitutional reform allows the courts to charge filing fees, there are&#13;
currently no official charges of any kind for using the judicial system 23 On this level, justice&#13;
is theoretically accessible to everyone. However, this 'free' justice system also contributes&#13;
in part to the problems of inefficiency, poor quality of the judiciary and access to justice in&#13;
Ecuador. The current system creates incentives for court employees and judges to charge&#13;
unauthorized fees to parties.&#13;
20  Although mediation is available in thc Chamber of Commerce. there have onlN been approximately six&#13;
cases in Quito and there is not muchi information about the sticcess of the system&#13;
2 Thcre are four public defeniders in Quito. four in Guavaquil, onc in each of Azuav, Bolivar, Canar,&#13;

following is from the Judicial Sector Assessment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 15 -&#13;
2.42   The administration of justice is a valued service for which people are willing to pay.&#13;
Since there are no formal fees, there is the temptation to expropriate the value by improper&#13;
means This may lead to less transparency and inefficiency, and foster corruption and&#13;
favoritism where the quality of service depends on the price one is willing to pay&#13;
7. Legal Profession&#13;
2.43   Each Province in Ecuador has a bar association  There is also a federation of bar&#13;
association presidents. The primary role of the bar associations is to maintain a list of&#13;
lawyers who have officially graduated from law school and to discipline those who have&#13;
violated the ethical standards.24 There are 17,800 lawyers registered in Ecuador.25 It is&#13;
obligatory for all new law graduates to register with a bar association. In addition to&#13;
registration, lawyers are required to pay annual dues to the association.26  Law students&#13;
must register his or her law school degree with the Bar Association to practice law, but&#13;
there are no other requirements such as a bar examination, a period of internship or practical&#13;
training course.&#13;
2.44   The lack of effective standards of conduct for the legal profession contributes to the&#13;
overall poor reputation of the profession. It has been suggested that standards and&#13;
disciplinary mechanisms are not sufficient to deter unethical behavior of lawyers. The bar&#13;
association is not even enforcing the standards that are in place currently. Each bar&#13;
association has a disciplinary system which includes a Tribunal de Honor In Quito the&#13;
Tribunal receives about 120 complaints per year. 27 There are no statistics to show how&#13;
many cases result in sanctions 28 The main problem is that the ethical standards used to&#13;
review complaints are inadequate. The Tribunal applies the ethical standards included in the&#13;
Law of the National Federation of Lawyers which do not provide effective guidance to&#13;
lawyers on how to govern their conduct .29&#13;
8. Legal Education&#13;
2.45   There are eleven law schools in Ecuador30 and each has its own curriculum. While&#13;
there are no entrance requirements at the public universities, each private institution has its&#13;
24  The ethical standards to be observed by lawvyers are contained in the Ley de Federacion de Abogados,&#13;
Capitulo II, Art. 23&#13;
25  In Quito there are 3,871 lawycrs registered and in Cuenca there about 2.000.&#13;
26  However, in Quito only 500 lawyers pay their annual dues cvcry year.&#13;
27  For example, according to the Bar Association in Quito, in 1995 there werc 20 cases of persons&#13;
misreprcsenting themselves to be lawyers. There are also instances where lawyers arc paid to sign&#13;
plcadings in cases where nonlawvers arc representing the clicnts.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16 -&#13;
own requirements. The course of study ranges from four to six years in length if pursued on&#13;
a full-time basis. However, because most students work while they attend school, very few&#13;
are full-time students. At the University of Central in Quito where enrollment is&#13;
approximiately 6,000 only 400 students a year complete the course work and only 80&#13;
complete the thesis to obtain the degree of"Doctor". However, there are no national&#13;
statistical records that provide a basis for preliminary assessments or comparisons. Absent&#13;
these data, minimum standards for operations or graduates' capabilities cannot realistically&#13;
be established, thus permitting the doubt about the quality to continue.&#13;
2.46   The curriculum does not concentrate on teaching skills, including analytical skills as&#13;
well as such practical skills as research, writing, negotiation, investigation and fact-finding.&#13;
In addition, the curriculum does not include any course in ADR, intellectual property rights,&#13;
economics etc. Furthermore, ethics even though is a required course at many law schools, is&#13;
taught in the religious or moral sense. As a consequence, judges are inadequately prepared&#13;
for the bench.&#13;
2.47   Although legal clinics do exist at which students may work, there are no adequate,&#13;
well-supervised clinical programs which provide on-the-job training for law students and&#13;
which are organized so that the learning process progresses through the stages of the&#13;
student's professional development.&#13;
2.48   In addition, the law professors have either not kept up to date with changes in the&#13;
law or use outdated teaching methods. Salaries for law professors are very low where a&#13;
full-time professor may earn on average $100.00. It is not surprising, therefore, that most&#13;
professors consider teaching to be a pro-bono activity. The professors are committed and&#13;
talented amateurs who contribute to their profession and the public through the sharing of&#13;
learning. Such persons cannot of course be expected to be educated in the principles and&#13;
practices of adult higher learning.&#13;
9. Judicial Training&#13;
2.49   New judges that are appointed are not well-prepared for the job on the bench, and&#13;
experienced judges have little access to training to enhance their skills. For instance, many&#13;
judges have difficulties understanding or adequately preparing to handle complex intellectual&#13;
property cases and cases involving economic issues&#13;
2.50   The fact that the salaries of judges have historically been extremely low has made it&#13;
difficult for the judiciary to attract judges from the ranks of lawyers. Although the&#13;
Constitution recognizes the notion of judicial careers, the laws that regulate these careers&#13;
are only followed when convenient. The Supreme Court issued regulations that establish a&#13;
formal judicial career in 1990.32 These regulations established the National Judicial Career&#13;
Commission which consists of the President of the Supreme Court, a Supreme Court&#13;
Justice, a Superior Court Judge, and the President of the National Federation of Judicial&#13;

Employees. The Commission is expected to establish personnel policies and guidelines, but&#13;
it has not set up or implemented any such guidelines.&#13;
2.51   Continuing legal education for lawyers and judges is very limited. With new judges&#13;
coming from private practice and with sometimes limited experience, it is essential to have&#13;
continuing legal training. Lawyers also need continuing legal education because the laws&#13;
often change and it is difficult for lawyers to keep abreast of the changes.&#13;
10. Disciplinary System&#13;
2.52   The system by which judges are removed from the bench is not centralized and does&#13;
not offer the transparency and consistency needed in the process. Presently there are two&#13;
ways to file complaints about a lower court judge.33 One is with the Comisi6n de Quejas&#13;
and Reclamos34 (a Complaint Commission) and the other is with a Commission in the&#13;
Superior Court. The disciplinary authority was transferred from these Commissions to the&#13;
Judicial Council in the Constitutional reform of 1992. Once operational the Judicial Council&#13;
will become the only body which would receive complaints about judges at the Superior&#13;
Court level and below.&#13;
33 With regard to Supreme Court Justices, they are removed only by Congress.&#13;

3. JUDICIAL REFORM PROGRAM&#13;
A. GOVERNMENT'S REFORM STRATEGY AND PROGRAM&#13;
3.1   In August 1994, the Bank, at the invitation of the Government prepared a Judicial&#13;
Sector Review which analyzed the current state of the judicial system in Ecuador. With the&#13;
collaboration of the Government and the Judiciary, the report made specific&#13;
recommendations for reform.&#13;
3.2   In January 1995, a Judicial Reform Working Group headed by a Supreme Curt&#13;
Justice as the representative of the judiciary and composed of members of the Executive,&#13;
Procurador General del Estado and Fiscalia de la Nacion developed an expansive judicial&#13;
reform program which included reforms in the judiciary, the Procuraduria, Fiscalia,&#13;
Ministerio Publico, Police, and bar associations, law schools, secondary schools, and&#13;
Chambers of Commerce. This Group prepared a document in May 1995 which outlined an&#13;
overall program to be carried out by the Government over the next decade by the various&#13;
actors in judicial reform. The program aims to increase the efficiency of and access to&#13;
dispute resolution as well as strengthen the independence of the judiciary. The group&#13;
recommended the creation of a project coordination unit to manage the implementation of&#13;
the program as well as the Bank's project. The program was disseminated among the&#13;
Executive, Judiciary and representatives of the Legislative branches as well as in the NGO&#13;
community. Consensus was reached about the areas for reform. This document was&#13;
presented by the President of the Supreme Court and the Executive and provides the basis&#13;
for the proposed Bank project.&#13;
3.3   The Judicial Reform Program is the product of a unique collaborative effort between&#13;
the Supreme Court and the Executive. The ultimate goal of the Judicial Reform Program is&#13;
to create a judicial system that contributes to economic growth by facilitating private sector&#13;
activity and to social welfare by guaranteeing the basic rights of all citizens.&#13;
B. RATIONALE FOR BANK INVOLVEMENT&#13;
3.4   The project is substantially consistent with the 1993 Country Assistance Strategy .&#13;
In particular, the project would assist in the process of modernization of the state, improve&#13;
public sector management in support of growth, assist in poverty alleviation and provide&#13;
conflict resolution mechanisms for the private sector. With the overall work of the Bank in&#13;
public administration reform, and a background in ESW of the judiciary, it is perceived by&#13;
the Government that the Bank has a comparative advantage to assist in this area. Currently,&#13;
there is momentum in Ecuador for making changes in the judicial system (as seen above).&#13;
However, outside help is important to support these reforms. The Bank's participation is&#13;
critical in initiating and supporting a complex modernization effort involving wide-ranging&#13;
organizational and procedural changes, institution building, management skills and tools,&#13;
and legal training. The Bank and IDB projects are complementary and both are important to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
support the Government and specifically the judiciary during this reform process as the&#13;
judiciary both provides an essential public service and can have a strong impact on economic&#13;
performance. The quality of governance is directly affected by the judiciary's performance&#13;
An efficient and transparent judiciary is essential for the enforcement of law and the&#13;
assurance of accountability in other branches of Government&#13;
3.5    The Judicial Reform Program is an overall judicial reform to take place over a period&#13;
of many years and is divided into several phases. The Judiciary and the Executive together&#13;
with the World Bank, IDB and other agencies (e.g. USAID) have developed a strategy to&#13;
implement the reform program. The proposed Bank loan would cover the first phase of the&#13;
judicial reform and involves only those areas which the Government itself has earmarked as&#13;
priorities. While the components of the Bank project are an integral part of the overall&#13;
Judicial Reform Program, they are limited enough in scope to allow the project to be&#13;
focused and to respond to the implementation capacity of the judiciary&#13;
3.6    Moreover, the Bank project would complement the reform efforts of the IDB and&#13;
USAID. Although the Bank project includes well rounded components, many of the&#13;
reforms outlined in the Judicial Reform Program will be conducted under a program&#13;
financed by the IDB. The reform efforts under the IDB project are directed at the judiciary,&#13;
the Ministerio Piblico, the Colegio de Abogados, various NGO's and the private sector.&#13;
These reform efforts will include a restructuring of the central court administration,&#13;
improvement of the Judicial Council and specific legislative reforms. The proposed Bank&#13;
project would also balance the on-going USAID project which is focused on the criminal&#13;
justice system.&#13;
C. LESSONS LEARNED FROM PREVIOUS BANK EXPERIENCE&#13;
3.7   Since this project would represent the Bank's first operation in support of justice&#13;
reform in Ecuador, no lessons of sectoral experience are available. Moreover, given the&#13;
recent genesis of judicial reform projects by the Bank, there has not been much experience&#13;
in the area from which to draw lessons However, there have been some initiatives in other&#13;
countries including Argentina, Bolivia, Venezuela and Peru The research studies completed&#13;
indicate that many of the judiciaries in Latin America are facing similar problems as&#13;
Ecuador, including the inefficiency of court administration, insufficient legal training and&#13;
insufficient access to justice. The preparation of the Bolivia project demonstrated the&#13;
importance for consensus building within the judiciary. Important lessons learned from the&#13;
Venezuela project include ensuring a commitment from the Supreme Court in supporting&#13;
and implementing the reforms It is important for the judiciary to be fully educated and&#13;
informed about the objectives of the reforms through study tours, workshops and pilot&#13;
projects. In addition, there is a need to establish clear coordination responsibilities between&#13;
the Executive and Judicial Powers.&#13;
3.8    Other projects which are not specifically judicial reform projects reveal that project&#13;
implementation is crucial It is essential that there be an experienced, highly skilled and&#13;
politically independent project coordination .&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
3.9   The present proposal accounts for these points by: (i) holding workshops and&#13;
seminars for judges and the legal community, working with the Advisory Committee in&#13;
order to ensure commitment and build consensus among the judiciary and informing NGOs&#13;
and the public about the reform program, and (ii) establishing a highly-skilled Project&#13;
Coordination Unit. In Ecuador, the weakness of the public sector managerial and&#13;
administrative capacity is reflected in the active loan portfolio, which, as of March 1994,&#13;
numbered 14 approved projects (totaling US$723.9 million in commitments), of which 11&#13;
have explicit institution-building components. Recognizing the persistent weakness of the&#13;
Ecuadorian public sector, institution building has been a major objective of the Bank's&#13;
lending strategy: of the 7 projects in the proposed FY 94-96 lending program (totaling&#13;
US$243.6 million), 5 are for technical assistance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
4. THE PROJECT&#13;
4.1   The Judicial Reform Program itself will take place over several phases and will&#13;
require international as well as local assistance (See Government's Judicial Reform&#13;
Program). The proposed loan is designed to achieve the overall goals of the reform&#13;
program of improving the efficiency and access to disputes resolution and will represent the&#13;
first phase which will last 5 years. The project will focus on establishing the institutional&#13;
capability for proceeding with the larger scale reform program.&#13;
4.2   The overarching goal of the Bank project would be to improve the capacity of the&#13;
judicial system by strengthening the administration of justice. Specifically, the proposed&#13;
project aims at: increasing efficiency, effectiveness and transparency in the judicial process&#13;
by improving case administration procedures; improving the infrastructure, expanding the&#13;
use of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms within the court system; improving the&#13;
access to justice by the public and women in particular; and improving court reform and&#13;
research and legal education.&#13;
4.3   The project will concentrate on the courts located in Quito and Guayaquil as these&#13;
two cities have the greatest delays in case processing. This geographical concentration of&#13;
the project represents another effort to keep the project focused and well defined. All&#13;
reforms introduced in Quito and Guayaquil will be done with a view to developing reform&#13;
strategies which can be expanded later throughout the country either through a separate&#13;
project or by Ecuador itself.&#13;
A. PROJECT DESCRIPTION&#13;
4.4   The project would aim at strengthening the judiciary in the processing of cases in an&#13;
efficient and fair manner-- that is, providing judges and court personnel with new case&#13;
management techniques, information technology and mediation procedures which will allow&#13;
cases to be resolved in an efficient and effective manner as well as improving access to&#13;
justice and the quality of judicial training. Through these components, the judiciary should&#13;
experience efficiency gains and improvements in the quality of service delivered to the&#13;
public- both of which are elements contributing to the independence of the judiciary.&#13;
B. PROJECT COMPONENTS&#13;
4.5   The World Bank project would finance consulting services, training, equipment, and&#13;
building and office renovation through the following components and their respective base&#13;
costs: a Case Administration and Information Support program, US $4.5 million; a Court-&#13;
Annexed Alternative Dispute Resolution program, US $1.4 million; a Program for Law and&#13;
Justice, US $3.5 million; and an Infrastructure program, US $2.8 million. Total project&#13;
costs are estimated to be $14.3 million. (See summary cost tables Annex 16)&#13;

4.7   The Case Administration and Information Support component is a fundamental&#13;
element in the overall goal of improving the capacity of the courts. The goal of the&#13;
component itself would be to improve the management of cases filed in Quito and&#13;
Guayaquil. There are nine subcomponents of the case administration and information&#13;
support component:&#13;
*  caseflow management and a specific delay reduction program to analyze the causes of&#13;
delay and develop recommendations to address those issues- this program will include a&#13;
national conference on delay reduction which will be followed by the establishment of&#13;
delay reduction pilot projects in the First Instance Courts in Quito and Guayaquil&#13;
*  establishment of systems to improve access to information regarding cases by the users&#13;
of the judicial branch&#13;
*  establishment of a records management system including purging case files and&#13;
experimenting with an appropriate system for maintaining and recording oral&#13;
proceedings&#13;
*  development of standardization of legal forms&#13;
*  establishing trial court performance standards to respond to the need to adopt a service&#13;
and performance oriented mentality, thereby shifting the focus to the needs of the users&#13;
of the system, and allowing the judiciary to monitor the service it provides.&#13;
-  development of operational manuals&#13;
*  development of training programs for current First Instance Court judges in Quito and&#13;
Guayaquil on case administration (since the other areas of judicial training will be&#13;
covered under the proposed IDB project)&#13;
-  automating the trial courts&#13;
*  development and improvement of management information system including the judicial&#13;
statistical system which, in part, will assist in case tracking systems and in analyzing the&#13;
causes of delay. (see Annex 2)&#13;
2. Component 11: Court-Annexed Alternative Dispute Resolution Mechanisms&#13;
4.8   Subcomponent I: Court-Annexed Pilot Mediation Programs. The main objective of&#13;
this subcomponent is to address some of the principal problems of the Ecuadorian judiciary,&#13;
including backlogs, costs of litigation, fairness and effectiveness through mediation&#13;
programs. Pilot mediation programs will be established in Quito and Guayaquil and would&#13;
permit the public to go directly to mediation unit as well as the juzgados to refer cases to the&#13;
court-annexed mediation unit for mediation services. As discussed below, an in-depth ADR&#13;
study is envisaged under the Special Fund. Working Groups have been established in both&#13;
Quito and Guayaquil. These Working Groups will assist in monitoring the pilot programs&#13;
and provide advice as needed. (see Annex 4)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
4.9    Subcomponent 2: ADR training. ADR education will be required to. train those&#13;
who will act as mediators in the pilot mediation programs in Quito and Guayaquil,&#13;
disseminate information to the public; provide general information to professionals&#13;
interested in the topic; and enrich the legal education system. Programs will be developed to&#13;
train judges selected to refer cases to mediation and for professional and administrative&#13;
mediation staff. If one or both of the pilot programs opt to use the services of volunteer&#13;
mediators, a training program will also be designed for that purpose. (see Annex 5)&#13;
3. Component III: Program for Law and Justice&#13;
4.10   The above three components of the project represent specific priorities that have&#13;
been identified and tackle specific shortcomings in the current Ecuadorian judiciary&#13;
specifically in Quito and Guayaquil. Consequently, these components are the result of a&#13;
top-down planning process. However, the project is intended to provide a mechanism to&#13;
research and implement certain activities that are needed to prepare the way for the&#13;
Government's overall judicial reform program throughout the country. Activities will&#13;
include a Special Fund for Law and Justice which will provide for demand driven solutions&#13;
to the many issues facing the administration of justice, professional development program&#13;
for judicial training, an empirical study on the state of legal education, and a study on&#13;
property right registration (see Annex 6)&#13;
4. 11   Subcomponent 1: Special Fund for Law and Justice. In particular, a demand driven&#13;
Special Fund will be established in two parts to promote increased participation in the&#13;
reform and support the advancement of four critical areas: legal education and information,&#13;
access to justice, law reform and research and, court reform focused on modernization and&#13;
decentralization for the improvement of the administration ofjustice. The proposed projects&#13;
would be non- profit and items eligible for financing would be specific investments (goods&#13;
or civil works) or technical assistance activities. The proposed project would finance&#13;
technical assistance to approve and supervise subprojects.&#13;
4 12 The Special Fund will be managed by the Project Coordination Unit through two&#13;
advisory panels, one panel for the following areas: legal education and information, access&#13;
to justice, and law reform and research, and another panel for court reform focused on&#13;
modernization and decentralization for the improvement of the administration ofjustice.&#13;
Courts, public agencies involved in the judicial sector, non-governmental organizations and&#13;
individuals will be able to apply directly to the Special Fund through the Panels for grants to&#13;
support research and service activities in one of the above four areas. Panels will evaluate&#13;
grant proposals according to a set of criteria which would be included in the operational&#13;
manual Successful projects would be evaluated upon completion to assess their&#13;
replicability. (see Operational Framework Annex 7)&#13;
4.13   Subcomponent 2: Program for modernization of Property Registration. A well-&#13;
functioning registry system within judiciary for immovable (real property) and movable&#13;
(commercial) property formalizes property ownership, provides certainty for the registrants&#13;
themselves and facilitates an efficient market for real and personal property. The loan would&#13;
finance technical assistance to carry out this study. (see Annex 8)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
4.14   Subcomponent 3: Professional Development Program. Judicial training is essential if&#13;
the legal profession is to be respected and if there are to be competent judges. The main&#13;
objectives of this subcomponent would be to improve judicial training and enhance the&#13;
access to and development of legal information. The Project would finance technical&#13;
assistance as well as goods to carry out this program. (see Annex 9)&#13;
4.15   Subcomponent 4: Study on the State of Legal Education. This study would establish&#13;
base-line statistics that can be maintained and reviewed on a regular basis with a view to&#13;
using them to formulate minimum acceptable standards for legal education in Ecuador and&#13;
fostering international cooperation for legal and judicial training programs. The Project&#13;
would finance technical assistance in carrying this study and would be in consultation with a&#13;
Committee on Legal Education. (see Annex 10)&#13;
4. 16  Subcomponent 5: Research and Evaluation of Pilot Programs. Prior to the&#13;
implementation of the pilot programs in Quito and Guayaquil, a baseline study will be&#13;
conducted on the use of mediation in the two jurisdictions and on the characteristics of cases&#13;
in these jurisdictions.(see Annex 5)&#13;
4.17   Subcomponent 6: Legal Services Pilots. (see Annex 11). These pilots will provide&#13;
legal and complementary services to qualified women and their children so as to enable them&#13;
to obtain and secure their legal entitlements and begin to take action that will improve their&#13;
socio-economic positions.&#13;
4. Component IV: Infrastructure&#13;
4.18   The main objective of this component of the project will be to begin to improve the&#13;
infrastructure of the courts in Ecuador, which in its current state is a serious impediment to&#13;
the effective administration of justice, both from the perspective that the condition of the&#13;
facilities impedes the efficient administration of justice and that the designs for basic judicial&#13;
functions such as clerks offices and judges chambers do not reflect principles of modern and&#13;
efficient administration ofjustice.&#13;
4.19  Facilities (see Annex 12). The proposed project activities in the area of improving&#13;
judicial facilities involve the following elements.&#13;
4.20  (i) Development of a national strategy for courthouse facility development including&#13;
a five year facilities plan, national courthouse design standards with model layouts and&#13;
minimum infrastructure requirements defined.&#13;
4.21  (ii) Remodeling of the building purchased by the judicial branch to house judicial&#13;
offices currently located at the judicial center e.g. administrative offices, the new Consejo de&#13;
la Judicatura Nacional, or some trial courts, and remodeling of the space vacated by these&#13;
judicial offices in the central court building to create a Center of Justice for the courts of&#13;
Quito. As part of the project, the recently purchased Nacional Fund for Preinvestment&#13;
(FONAPRE) building in Quito, containing approximately 3,000 m/2, will be remodeled to&#13;
house judicial offices at a cost of about US$1.1 million. This was the least cost alternative&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
to upgrade the infrastructure of the courts The public works will be expected to take about&#13;
twelve months.&#13;
4.22  (iii) When the remodeling of FONAPRE is completed, approximately 1,500 m/2 of&#13;
space vacated will be remodeled for the first and second instance courts in Quito. The&#13;
creation of this space will allow the judicial branch to bring courts currently located in&#13;
substandard conditions in rented space outside the judicial center into the court complex.&#13;
The remodeling also will allow for the possible introduction of a new organizations and&#13;
designs such as centralized clerical functions. Similar remodeling of the judicial center in&#13;
Guayaquil will be carried out to bring w'nat is a substandard building t o more functional&#13;
levels. Full execution of the latter works would be provided for through project financing&#13;
4.23  (iv) Pilot decentralized judicial facilities will be created in Guayaquil and Quito&#13;
using the design standards adopted and incorporating modern case management techniques.&#13;
The decentralized courthouses will fulfill the mandate of the recent Constitutional Reform&#13;
for Government decentralization. The centers developed through Bank financing will serve&#13;
as a model for other decentralized courthouses throughout the country. These judicial&#13;
centers will be housed in remodeled buildings.&#13;
C. PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING PLAN&#13;
4.24  Total project costs are estimated at US$14.3 million equivalent, with a foreign&#13;
exchange component of US$3.2 million, or 22% of project costs. Project costs include&#13;
US$968,000 for physical ($378,000) and price ($590,000) contingencies. The proposed&#13;
loan of US$ 10.7 million equivalent covers about 75% of total project costs, net of taxes and&#13;
duties. The loan would finance 100% of the foreign exchange and 75% of the local&#13;
currency costs of about 1,430 staff months of consultants' services, of which 35 are&#13;
expected to be internationally recruited. The balance, US$3 6 million equivalent, or 25% of&#13;
the project costs, would be financed by the Government of Ecuador through budgetary&#13;
appropriations. The Ministry of Finance has agreed that 100% of the loan proceed would be&#13;
transferred to the PCU on an agreed, timely basis by means of an implementation&#13;
arrangement containing terms and conditions satisfactory to the Bank A PHRD grant from&#13;
Japan is financing pre-identified project preparation activities in the amount of Yen&#13;
70,000,000, equivalent to approximately US$667,000.&#13;

5. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
5.1    The proposed project will have one executing agency The Project Coordination&#13;
Unit The President of Ecuador has issued a Decree to establish the PCU As experience of&#13;
judicial reform activities is very limited in Ecuador and since the proposed project is not&#13;
solely focused on the judiciary, the Executive Branch (Presidency since there is no Ministry&#13;
of Justice) together with the Supreme Court established a project office that is headed by the&#13;
appointed Coordinator. This office will have direct responsibilitv for implementation of the&#13;
project. A Project Coordinator has been hired who will have primary responsibility for&#13;
implementation of the project. The Project Coordinator will also monitor the project&#13;
execution, including administrative aspects, and advise the Advisory Committee on project&#13;
implementation and work closely with the judiciary. The Advisory Committee established&#13;
by Presidential Decree will be composed of representatives of the President of the Supreme&#13;
Court, President of the Republic, Congress, Fiscalia and Procuraduria A legal affairs&#13;
director, and administrative director have also been hired under the PCU. (see Annex 13)&#13;
B. IMPLEMENTATION ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
5.2   Implementation will be paced to match a gradual build-up of institutional capacity.&#13;
Interventions related to case management, alternative dispute resolution mechanisms, and&#13;
other projects will be implemented on a pilot basis in order to build gradually the experience&#13;
of managing projects. The pilots will be concentrated in first instance civil courts in both&#13;
Quito and Guayaquil. (see attached matrix, Annex 14)&#13;
5.3    Design of the pilot ADR programs, case selection methodology, and case and staff&#13;
selection criteria have all been considered by several working groups, which have been&#13;
established in Quito and Guayaquil.35&#13;
5.4   In addition performance indicators for the project have been developed  The time&#13;
delay study conducted by the Bank provides performance indicators for the pilot first&#13;
instance courts (see Annex 15)&#13;
5.5    An operational manual that will guide the PCU and the Program for Law and Justice&#13;
is a condition for effectiveness. The operational manual will also include the performance&#13;
indicators that have been developed, the operational framework for the Special Fund as well&#13;
as all the terms of reference that have been developed and agreed to.&#13;
35  Thcsc working groups are comprised of judges (of all courts in each jurisdiction). lawvvers. university&#13;
professors and administrators and representatives of non-governmental organiatlions involved in ADR&#13;
projects. Group members were selected on the basis of their commitment to ADR and their reputations&#13;
for excellence and diligence in their respective fields.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
C. PROCUREMENT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
5.6   The PCU will be responsible for all procurement. In order to strengthen the capacity&#13;
of carrying out procurement activities, key staff in the PCU would be trained and be&#13;
familiarized with the Bank's requirements. Consultants financed under the loan would be&#13;
selected and hired by the PCU in accordance with procedures and criteria set forth in the&#13;
"Guidelines for the Use of Consultants by World Bank Borrowers and by the World Bank as&#13;
Executing Agency" published by the Bank in August 1981. The PCU will use Bank-issued&#13;
standard forms of contract and model letters of invitation (LOI) when hiring consultants for&#13;
the project.&#13;
5.7   Procurement for goods and works would follow the Bank Procurement Guidelines&#13;
as published in January 1995 and revised in January 1996. Existing Ecuadorian legislation&#13;
contains various procurement provisions that are incompatible with Bank guidelines,&#13;
therefore, special provisions dealing with points of differences, either in substance or in&#13;
interpretation, between Bank guidelines--for procurement and for the use of consultants--&#13;
and Ecuadorian legislation are included in the Loan Agreement. Bank-issued standard&#13;
bidding documents (SBDs) will be used for all ICBs (international competitive bidding);&#13;
Bank's SBD, appropriately modified and acceptable to the Bank, would be used for all&#13;
NCBs (national competitive bidding).&#13;
5.8    Goods. The software, hardware, training, and maintenance service contracts for the&#13;
technology implementation of the Case Administration Component, together with other&#13;
similar computers needed in other components would be packaged and procured together,&#13;
to the extent feasible, using ICB, costing US$250,000 or more per contract. Other isolated&#13;
computers and office/specialized equipment needed would be procured: (a) using LIB&#13;
among suppliers with service and maintenance facilities in Ecuador, for contracts with&#13;
estimated values between $100,000 and $250,000 up to an aggregate limit of $400,000 and&#13;
(b) using shopping procedures, requiring at least three quotations from eligible suppliers, for&#13;
the individual contracts of less than $50,000 each, up to an aggregate limit of $400,000.&#13;
5.9   Works. Court remodeling work under the Infrastructure Component, estimated to&#13;
cost over US$250,000 per contract, would be procured through NCBs. Since the individual&#13;
civil work package is not expected to exceed US$3.0 million equivalent, and thus is unlikely&#13;
to interest foreign contractors, no ICB is anticipated for the procurement of civil works.&#13;
Other small works including minor infrastructure works (each costing less than US$250,000&#13;
equivalent per contract) up to an aggregate limit of US$400,000, will be procured under&#13;
lump sum, fixed price contracts awarded on the basis of quotations obtained from three&#13;
qualified contractors in response to a written invitation, in accordance with procedures&#13;
acceptable to the Bank.&#13;
5.10   Special Funds. The Special Fund activities will be grouped into two separate&#13;
subcomponents: research activities (involving the procurement of consulting services) and&#13;
non-research activities (involving the procurement of goods and works) with a maximum&#13;
grant amount of $100,000 per proposal with the possibility of multiple applications. Grants&#13;
for $1 0,000 or less will have simplified procedures. All consulting services, goods and&#13;
works financed by the Special Funds will be procured in accordance with the Bank&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
Guidelines. All contracts under the Special Funds are expected to be small. Goods and&#13;
works will be procured using methods determined in accordance with the threshold&#13;
established in paragraphs 5 8 and 5.9 above and the aggregate limits established above for&#13;
the each method will also apply to purchases under the Special Funds.&#13;

service contracts, service contracts, estimated to cost over US$75,000 for firms and&#13;
US$30,000 for individuals, as well as all single-source consultant contracts and consultant&#13;
contracts for assignments of a critical nature as reasonably determined by the Bank, will be&#13;
subject to the Bank's prior review Goods contracts costing over US$50,000 and works&#13;
contracts costing over US$250,000 per contract are also required the Bank's prior review.&#13;
&#13;

Furthermore, amendments to contracts raising their value above the respective thresholds as&#13;
stated above would necessitate the Bank's prior review. These prior review arrangements&#13;
will ensure ex-ante review by the Bank of about 85% of the total value of all Bank-financed&#13;
contracts.&#13;

US$50,000 and works costing over US$250,000 per contract would be supported by full&#13;
documentation; other contracts of lesser amount as well as all training and incremental&#13;
operating costs would be made on the basis of Statement of Expenditure (SOE), for which&#13;
supporting documents would be maintained by the PCU, and would be made available for&#13;
Bank's selective review. Withdrawal applications for consulting firm contracts costing over&#13;
US$75,000 and individual consultant's contracts costing over US$30,000 would be&#13;
supported by full documentation.&#13;
5.14   Special account. A Special Account in US dollars would be opened at the Central&#13;
Bank, or other commercial bank, with an initial deposit of US$300,000 to facilitate project&#13;
execution. A higher amount, corresponding to about four months of expected project&#13;
expenditures, up to the limit of US$750,000 equivalent, may be requested after cumulative&#13;
disbursements have reached US$1.5 million equivalent. The Bank would replenish the&#13;
Special Account for the amount of the withdrawals on account of eligible expenditures at&#13;
the request of the Borrower.&#13;

E. ACCOUNTING AND AUDIT ARRANGEMENTS&#13;
5. 15  An audit of the financial status of the project would take place once a year. The&#13;
audit would be carried out by an independent auditor acceptable to the Bank. The audit&#13;
reports would be sent to the Bank not more than four months after the end of each calendar&#13;
year. The report would include, inter alia, specific opinions on: (a) sources of proceeds and&#13;
their use, (b) SOEs, and (c) implementation of contracting clauses, including the application&#13;
of eligibility criteria, and compliance with procurement procedures and other financing&#13;
conditions. The Special Account would also be similarly audited.&#13;
5.16   The PCU will prepare in accordance with terms of reference included in the&#13;
Operational Manual on December 31 and June 30 of each year, a progress report on the&#13;
activities carried out under the project for that period and plans for the next twelve months&#13;
of activities.&#13;
6. ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS&#13;
6.1    The proposed operation aims to improve the enforceability of legal and contractual&#13;
rights through improved judicial administration and increased access to alternative dispute&#13;
resolution mechanisms. As such, the project is not expected to adversely affect the&#13;
environment. In the medium term, the project could have a positive impact on the&#13;
environment as it reinforces the effectiveness of legal regulation over social and economic&#13;
activities. An effective legal framework is a key instrument for deterring environmentally&#13;
damaging activities or seeking remedies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
7.  BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
7.1    The principal benefits of the project would be a judicial process with improved&#13;
efficiency and more rational decision-making. It is expected that the time it takes for cases&#13;
to go through the system will decrease, and the percentage of cases disposed as a proportion&#13;
of the number of filings in each court would increase, and the cost to process each case&#13;
would decrease. This in turn would lead to an increase in public confidence in the judiciary&#13;
and its role in enforcing the law as well as in the stability of government institutions in&#13;
Ecuador. An effective and efficient judiciary would also contribute to both economic&#13;
growth by facilitating private sector activity and to social welfare by guaranteeing the basic&#13;
rights of all citizens. The beneficiaries from these reforms include the judiciary itself, the&#13;
private sector and general public. In addition, the project is part of a far reaching Judicial&#13;
Reform Program to be conducted by the Government and implemented by other&#13;
international organizations.&#13;
7.2    The major risks to successful project implementation are: whether the judiciary has&#13;
the institutional capacity to implement its components; whether the Advisory Committee can&#13;
obtain the support of the Government and Non-governmental Agencies. Since this is the&#13;
first experience with the Supreme Court, the project may experience some delays.&#13;
7.3    A pervasive issue in Ecuador is political fragmentation, coupled with the mandatory&#13;
change in administration every four years. The latter suggests the need for short-term,&#13;
tangible results to accompany longer-term objectives. The proposed project has been&#13;
structured to address this need. Additional issues to consider include the requirement for&#13;
focused identification of project components, the critical requisite for an active project&#13;
leader, the need for close project supervision; and the possibility of diminishing official&#13;
commitment as the electoral process approaches. Project design would also safeguard&#13;
against the Project Coordination Unit eventually substituting for real and sustainable&#13;
institution-building actions by ensuring that training and technology transfer take place&#13;
during project implementation and are institutionalized.&#13;
7.4    Generally, changing the legal framework requires a significant level of consensus&#13;
among those directly affected. In 1992 a new Criminal Procedure Code was presented in&#13;
Congress after having been developed without any broad-based public participation. The&#13;
Code did not pass into law because the affected legal community opposed it.36 This&#13;
example serves to illustrate that all envisioned changes need to originate from an extensive&#13;
process of consensus-building. The participatory nature of the ideas for and implementation&#13;
of the proposed project was designed specifically with this need in mind.&#13;
36  Thc draft Criminal Codc is now being revised with the support of Corporacion Latinoamericana Para&#13;
cl Dcsarrollo (CLD).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
A. EXPECTED OUTCOMES&#13;
7.5   The project is expected to produce more efficient and effective results in the first&#13;
instance courts. Performance indicators have been developed based on a time delay study&#13;
conducted in 1995. The indicators developed are those that are commonly used by judicial&#13;
sector to measure efficiency and effectiveness. These include time of filing to disposition&#13;
and disposition per judges along with a economic indicator that measures cost of&#13;
disposition. It is expected that the median time it takes for cases to go through the system&#13;
will decrease five to eleven months depending on the type of case. It is also expected that&#13;
the percentage of cases disposed as a proportion of the number of filings in each court&#13;
would increase to 10-20% per year (see Annex 15). This will be monitored during project&#13;
implementation. With the improved case administration and training of court personnel,&#13;
judges would have more time to devote to judicial decision-making. In addition, improved&#13;
training of judges would improve the quality of decisions based on sound legal reasoning,&#13;
and, therefore, the number of cases appealed should be reduced as well.&#13;
B. PROJECT SUSTAINABILITY&#13;
7.6    As one part of a long term judicial reform process by the Government, the project is&#13;
an integral element in the overhaul of the judiciary in Ecuador. The sustainability of the&#13;
project will depend in part on the continued commitment of the Government to the Judicial&#13;
Reform Program. The high degree of consultation at every stage of the project will assist in&#13;
ensuring that these reform efforts are continued.&#13;
7.7   Preparation of the judicial reform program included the participation of the&#13;
Judiciary, Executive, Procuraduria, and Fiscalia through the judicial reform working group.&#13;
In addition, a workshop with the Government, NGO's and international organizations was&#13;
held to develop an implementation strategy for the reforms. The participatory approach was&#13;
also used in preparation of the Bank's project components which has contributed to the&#13;
strong ownership of the project by the Government. In this way, the project enjoys wide&#13;
support from all political parties and interest groups and, therefore, would transcend&#13;
individual governments' interests. In addition, the project will not finance significant&#13;
amounts of recurrent costs so that there will not be large financial burdens placed on the&#13;
Government towards the end of its implementation.&#13;
7.8    One specific activity directly aimed at providing project-driven improvement is the&#13;
establishment of the Advisory Committee which would guide the project and be composed&#13;
of representatives from the Judiciary, Congress, Presidencia, Procuraduria and Fiscalia. In&#13;
addition, the Special Fund for Law and Justice is directly aimed at providing demand driven&#13;
improvement. It is envisaged that this Fund would be able to solicit outside funds in order&#13;
to be sustainable beyond the life of the project. As previously explained Advisory Panels&#13;
would be established to administer this fund. The Bank will closely follow the appointment&#13;
of these members to ensure that well qualified professionals are chosen for the Panels and&#13;
that transparency is inherent in the recruitment process.&#13;

9. APPENDICES&#13;
ANNEX 1: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE CASE ADMINISTRATION AND INFORMATION&#13;
SUPPORT COMPONENT&#13;
Background&#13;
The Ecuadorian judicial system is plagued by major problems of delay which contribute to the&#13;
inefficiency of the system. Every effort must be made to reduce unnecessary delays in resolving&#13;
matters brought before the judicial system. A major step toward reducing these delays can be&#13;
made by improving the current case administration infrastructure. This infrastructure needs to be&#13;
capable of managing the flow of cases and managing the system's resources. At present, the&#13;
Ecuadorian administrative infrastructure falls far short of this goal.&#13;
The following specific measures will be implemented in the Judicial Reform Project in an effort to&#13;
address the current shortfalls and to improve the overall administrative infrastructure in the&#13;
Ecuadorian judicial system.&#13;
Caseflow Management&#13;
Ensuring that cases continue to move through the system is a major element of an effective case&#13;
administration system. The elements for an effective caseflow management system are not&#13;
currently present in the judicial system. The current system is more reactive as opposed to&#13;
proactive. Moreover, judges do not see themselves as managers of their caseloads as well as&#13;
resolvers of disputes.&#13;
The caseflow system which will be implemented by this project is intended to achieve the&#13;
following objectives: ensure that all cases are disposed of in a manner that is just for all&#13;
participants; assure the quality of the legal process, ensure that all citizens have equal access to&#13;
the legal process, and ensure that each step in the legal process is completed within the time&#13;
allowed by law (Procedural Code). An improved caseflow management should include making&#13;
resource allocation decisions that take into account backlogs and that are based on demand for&#13;
services.&#13;
For these objectives to be achieved, the project must aim to create a system of caseflow&#13;
management at the trial court level which will consist of the following a system of statistical and&#13;
management reports to assist in the control and the movement of cases, quantifiable deadlines for&#13;
the completion of each step in the legal process which are fixed by law, rule or standard, a method&#13;
of measuring the success of the system in controlling the movement of cases relative to the&#13;
standards adopted, a system to provide for the equitable distribution of cases among judges with a&#13;
means to redistribute cases and provide additional judicial support as necessary, and&#13;
administrative support to assist in the management of the system.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
The following project activities will be undertaken to achieve these objectives: an analysis of the&#13;
current caseflow management system, a series of workshops and a national conference on the&#13;
causes of delay, and the establishment of a delay reduction program through pilot projects.&#13;
Firstly, a description of the caseflow management practices followed at the trial court level in the&#13;
various case types, e.g , civil, labor, commercial and landlord tenant, will be developed. This&#13;
work will be performed through a contract with a consulting firm which specializes in&#13;
organizational and system practices, and with specialists in Ecuadorian procedural law.&#13;
The analysis conducted by the consulting firm should encompass the various steps from filing to&#13;
disposition and should cite any laws or rules which control the movement of cases. The analysis&#13;
should include the following: how cases are distributed among judges; what registers and other&#13;
control mechanisms are in place to control cases; how judges schedule appearances, what&#13;
sanctions exist for failure to meet deadlines; what systems exist for redistributing cases in the&#13;
event of sickness, vacation or excessive backlogs, and what management reports are used to&#13;
control the movement of cases. In addition, the consultant should address the following specific&#13;
questions can the system of official notification be improved ?; do the activities of others, such&#13;
as hospitals which have to prepare physical reports and expert witnesses, contribute to delay ?;&#13;
does the system of assigning cases (sorteos) work efficiently  are there systems to equalize&#13;
workloads when delays build up in different courts after initial assignment ?&#13;
Upon completion of the analysis, the consulting firm will produce a report for the review and&#13;
consideration of the Supreme Court.&#13;
Secondly, the analyses and recommendations prepared above will form the agenda for a national&#13;
conference on procedural delay the preparatory workshops. The participants will include judges,&#13;
judicial support staff, practicing lawyers, legal experts and analysts. In addition, both local and&#13;
international consultants who have specialized in the area of case management will participate.&#13;
The participants in the conference will work in small groups to define techniques to improve the&#13;
judiciary's control of the movement of cases through the judicial process. The major output of&#13;
the conference will be the development of new standards for caseflow management. These&#13;
standards will include timing requirements for the major phases in case processing from filing to&#13;
disposition. In addition, the recommendations made by the participants of the conference for the&#13;
improvement of the case management system will be published.&#13;
Finally, a consultant or consulting firm will be hired to prepare a delay reduction program. The&#13;
consultant will base this program on the above analysis of the current case management system&#13;
and the standards and recommendations proposed at the national conference on delay reduction to&#13;
reduce caseload delay. The consultant will develop a delay reduction program endorsed by the&#13;
Supreme Court which will be implemented through pilot projects at the First Instance Level in&#13;
Quito and Guayaquil. These pilot projects will address the identified causes of delay. The&#13;
consultant should take into consideration the following typical techniques for delay reduction that&#13;
have proved successful in other jurisdictions:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
*   Separating judicial and administrative duties&#13;
*   Reducing contact between the judges and the public, especially ex parte contacts&#13;
*   Differential case management or setting different disposition strategies depending on&#13;
the complexity of the case&#13;
* Reducing the inventory of inactive cases&#13;
* Periodic docket review to ensure that cases are moving forward&#13;
* Use of technological advances&#13;
*   Add decision makers and legal staff, e.g., temporary judges, permanent judges, non-&#13;
judicial staff&#13;
* Analyzing the system for distributing cases to ensure it is equitable&#13;
* Reassigning cases away from backlogged courts&#13;
*   Greater oversight by a higher court&#13;
The consultant will ensure that the pilot project in Quito experiments with the benchmarks for&#13;
case processing times that were established by a recent delay study which was conducted in Quito&#13;
and financed by the Bank and similar studies to be developed in Guayaquil 37&#13;
Improve Access to Information Regarding Case Status&#13;
A major problem in the Ecuadorian justice system is that the parties often have significant&#13;
difficulty finding out needed information regarding their case such as its status, what is the next&#13;
step required, are all required documents on file, when is the next scheduled hearing. The lack of&#13;
this information often means that the case will languish because the parties do not take the next&#13;
required steps or miss a scheduled hearing. The lack of access to needed information also feeds&#13;
corruption as parties believe that they have to resort to payments to court personnel to find out&#13;
information that should be readily available.&#13;
Many court systems in the region are taking advantage of new technologies to provide needed&#13;
information to the users of the court system. Project activity will consist of the development of&#13;
public access computer systems which are linked with individual courts to allow for inquiry as to&#13;
case status as well as to legislative and administrative matters. Other techniques for providing&#13;
necessary information to the public such as automated answering systems will be experimented&#13;
with also.&#13;
Records Management&#13;
The current records management system contributes to the inefficiency, as opposed to the&#13;
efficiency, of the judicial branch. Reforms to the records management system will greatly alleviate&#13;
the current inefficiencies in the judicial system.&#13;
The interdependence of court records and court operations makes record management a priority&#13;
concern of the trial courts. The basic functions of court--disposing of cases and adjunct&#13;
37  See Buscasglia and Dakolias, July 1995. A similar dclay study is also planned for Guayaquil under PHRD&#13;
Grant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
operations as well as financial and statistical reporting -- rely on court records for their accuracy&#13;
Records management is an active, continuing program for controlling the intake, maintenance, use&#13;
and disposition of records.&#13;
The current records management system is not clearly defined and does not adhere to any national&#13;
standards Each court uses its own numbering system and develops its own internal systems for&#13;
registers which will enable it to maintain control over records. There are no standards on&#13;
maintenance of records, types of record keeping equipment, or systems that should be used. Case&#13;
files are usually maintained in the traditional Latin American manner of sewing them together and&#13;
then sewinig additional filings into the file.&#13;
There is a central, non-automated judicial archive which has approximately 2 million records in&#13;
storage Approximately 500,000 of these are on shelves while the remainder are on the floor.&#13;
Given the lack of space in the archive, a high number of terminated cases are maintained in the&#13;
courts themselves The estimate of the director of the judicial archive is that there about 2 million&#13;
files in the courts. These files take up valuable space that should be used for ongoing judicial&#13;
activities.&#13;
The objectives of the project activity are that the records management system, at least, will&#13;
consist of the following: guidelines for the management of records at each stage of the records&#13;
life cycle including disposition schedules and steps for adherence to legal requirements for&#13;
records; procedures for the successful completion of each required record or register such as case&#13;
intake registers, definition of the required registers and records series, standards and systems&#13;
developed at the national level on case storage and on the use of technology; and regular&#13;
schedules and procedures for forwarding terminated cases to the central archive.&#13;
To achieve these objectives, project activities will be divided into the following four areas and&#13;
implemented in coordination with the Supreme Court:&#13;
1. Establishing a Records Management System&#13;
An overview of the current records management system will be conducted by an analytic team&#13;
comprised of international and local consultants. This work will consist of proposing&#13;
standards for appropriate records management equipment; installing new records management&#13;
equipment; revising the records retention schedule to allow for the destruction of unnecessary&#13;
records, and creating a standing records management committee to oversee this area and a&#13;
records management technical assistance team to assist local courts.&#13;
The analytic team also will survey the present system of records retention to determine if there&#13;
are some inactive records which no longer have a useful legal life and can therefore be&#13;
destroyed Furthermore, an analysis will be conducted of how inactive records are stored to&#13;
determine if these processes should be modified. Included in this consideration will be&#13;
whether the location of the national archives is adequate or if regional archives should be&#13;
established&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
The analytic team will also create a manual which will include the following: rules for&#13;
numbering case files; a determination of the number and locale of registries on court actions;&#13;
methods for handling exhibits; standards for records security, including access to records; and&#13;
environmental controls for the protection of records against natural disaster. Throughout, the&#13;
analytic team will give consideration to what legislative reform, if any, may be necessary to&#13;
ensure adherence to the new system.&#13;
The development of this system will be linked with the changes in the caseflow management&#13;
system that are adopted.&#13;
2. Conduct a Purge of Case Files38&#13;
As the statistical system is not reliable, there is no current inventory of the number of cases&#13;
that are open in the Ecuadorian system. Moreover, as there is no systematic purging of cases,&#13;
the courts of Ecuador suffer from the accumulation of files which are not active in the&#13;
judicial offices. These accumulated files create space and efficiency problems and should be&#13;
purged so that the court is only handling those case files which are truly active.&#13;
To conduct such a purging, a consultant will be hired to undertake the following activities&#13;
with a team of assistants: conduct an inventory of case files in cases in Quito and Guayaquil&#13;
that are pending in the courts; establish a system for purging cases that are closed or no longer&#13;
actionable according to parameters established by a judicial oversight committee and that are&#13;
consistent with the code; set up offices in Quito and Guayaquil to carry out the purge; purge&#13;
the cases and send the purged files to the general archive for long term storage or for&#13;
destruction as appropriate; and institutionalize the purging process so that it is done on an&#13;
ongoing basis.&#13;
3. Improve the Records Management Equipment in the Trial Courts&#13;
Once the standards for records management equipment are established and the purge of case&#13;
files is completed, project activity should focus on upgrading the records management&#13;
equipment in use in the courts. A consultant will be hired to conduct this activity. In&#13;
particular, the consultant will consider open shelf filing equipment, register of action or case&#13;
history cards, and specialized register equipment. After such consideration, the consultant will&#13;
oversee the introduction of the appropriate equipment into the records management system.&#13;
4. Experiment with and Adopt Means to Maintain a Record of Oral Proceedings&#13;
8  Criminal courts are not included in this discussion because last year an actual head count of the number of&#13;
persons in prisons was conducted and then related to the number of cases against those prisoners. The&#13;
number of active cases was about 14,000. The estimates of the actual number of criminal case files in the&#13;
courts ranges up to 100,000. Many of those are inactive cases as there is no suspect, persons have died etc.&#13;
Similarly in the other case types, the number of truly active cases is significantlv smaller than what the courts&#13;
have in their inventory.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
The move to oral proceedings in Ecuadorian courts creates issues related to the design of&#13;
court facilities, the new role for personnel, and the maintenance of the appropriate record of&#13;
proceedings. At present, there is no clear pattern emerging as to how records of oral&#13;
proceedings should be maintained. Indeed, the oral process is so new in most countries in&#13;
Latin America that concerns about an accurate record of proceedings for appeal purposes has&#13;
not been a major topic of debate and concern. A truly transparent system will have the&#13;
capacity to produce an accurate record of any proceedings held in open court. As with other&#13;
issues in the Ecuadorian system, any solutions proposed must take into account financial&#13;
realities. If such realities are not considered, the new system will not be sustainable.&#13;
Experimentation should be carried out and appropriate systems and norms should be adopted.&#13;
A consultant will be hired to conduct these project activities. These activities will consist of a&#13;
series of pilot programs which will be conducted to determine the appropriate methods for&#13;
maintaining records which is consistent with the Ecuadorian procedural system. In particular&#13;
these pilot programs will: analyze which proceedings require a verbatim record of&#13;
proceedings versus a summary or Acta of the proceedings; review the current affordable&#13;
technologies for maintaining records, establish four to six pilot courts to experiment with the&#13;
technologies considered, adopt a suitable technology; and adopt norms which can be applied&#13;
to implement a court-wide program.&#13;
Standardization of Legal Forms&#13;
Currently, there is much repetitive work in the Ecuadorian judicial system that lends itself to the&#13;
use of standardized legal forms. The practice of adopting standardized forms for use by judges&#13;
and lawyers is one that can be used successfully to improve efficiency and increase uniformity of&#13;
practice throughout the courts. However, there is only minimal use of this technique in the&#13;
judicial branch. Implementing the use of standardized legal forms in the courts will help ensure&#13;
that necessary steps in the legal process are completed.&#13;
The activities undertaken in this component will include: identifying areas in which standardized&#13;
approaches are appropriate for all judges and courts; developing standardized forms for use in the&#13;
judicial process in civil courts, and developing training programs for judges, secretaries and clerks&#13;
on the use of the standardized forms.&#13;
An advisory committee will be appointed, which in turn will name a project team from among&#13;
judicial branch professionals. In addition, the advisory committee will hire a consultant, who in&#13;
coordination with the project team, will analyze the current forms and design new standardized&#13;
forms.&#13;
The development of standardized forms requires careful analysis of the various legal processes so&#13;
that they are accurately reflected in the forms. Initially, the legal procedures from a sample of at&#13;
least 30 case files taken from courts in Quito and Guayaquil will be analyzed to determine what&#13;
forms currently are in use, are proposed, or do not exist. This process will eliminate those&#13;
procedures that are outdated, inefficient or inappropriate so that they are not incorporated into&#13;
the standardized forms. The remaining procedures will be incorporated into standardized forms.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
For those areas in which forms do not exist, forms will be designed. The participation of&#13;
representatives from the judiciary and bar associations will be used to ensure the success and&#13;
applicability of this process.&#13;
Prior to designing any new forms or redesigning old forms, a form design manual which will&#13;
include standards for the format and language of forms will be designed. The forms manual will&#13;
be approved by the advisory committee and then made available throughout the judicial system so&#13;
that any new forms developed locally will be consistent with the approved format.&#13;
The advisory committee will review the proposed forms developed during the course of the&#13;
project and in the future whenever new forms are proposed.&#13;
Finally, a consultant will be hired to develop training programs in the use of the new standardized&#13;
forms. Such training will be necessary, as these forms may represent changes in procedures for&#13;
the judges, secretaries and clerks.&#13;
Trial Court Performance Standards&#13;
The discussions of the effectiveness and efficiency of the judicial branch often center on the needs&#13;
of the members of the system as opposed to the needs of its users. The debate within the judicial&#13;
branch most commonly centers on the need for more judges, more funds and more&#13;
computerization without measuring how these resources improve the delivery of dispute&#13;
resolution services to its users. There has been a recognition of the need to shift the evaluation&#13;
focus to the needs of the users of the system and to adopt a service and performance oriented&#13;
mentality.&#13;
The concept of measuring the performance of the judicial system has not been a subject of public&#13;
debate in Ecuador. The analyses conducted have tended to focus on structures and machinery.&#13;
While this type of analysis is absolutely necessary, looking at the performance of the system from&#13;
the users' perspective may give different insights into changes that should be implemented and&#13;
perhaps most importantly, how to prioritize the many changes that are necessary.&#13;
A consultant will be hired to conduct the following project activities: developing performance&#13;
standards for the court system which focus on delivering services to the users of the court system;&#13;
instituting methods of making the court system accountable to the public through such techniques&#13;
as the State of Courts annual report and user satisfaction surveys, implementing internal&#13;
monitoring of performance through the creation of operational audit functions; and introducing&#13;
quality management concepts into the administrative structure.&#13;
The expected outcome of this activity will be to: increase emphasis on the needs of the users of&#13;
the judicial branch, by focusing on elements such as access and hours of operation; incorporate&#13;
public concern into the planning for the allocation of resources; establish specific forms of&#13;
outreach to the general public to inform them about operations of the court system, and&#13;
institutionalize ongoing analysis and measurement of performance throughout the system. The&#13;
performance standards adopted will allow the project to measure the quality of the reforms as well&#13;
as the improvements to efficiency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
Operational Manuals&#13;
The Ecuadorian judicial branch is run by a general set of organic laws and rules of court adopted&#13;
by the Supreme Court At the court level, however, there are no operating guidelines and&#13;
manuals designed to make case processing procedures uniform for the judicial branch employees,&#13;
lawyers, litigants and general public.&#13;
An advisory committee of court personnel - judges, secretaries and others who are affected by the&#13;
procedures - working in conjunction with professional staff and consultants will be established to&#13;
develop the procedures. The analysis of and recommendations for the caseflow management will&#13;
form the basis for the development of operational manuals and will be used by the advisory&#13;
committee and consultants in the development of this work.&#13;
Project activity will focus on the modernization of case processing techniques including:&#13;
documenting the current processes in use to control the movement of cases; comparing the&#13;
processes to statutes, rules, and standards adopted, discussing how the processes can be improved&#13;
through a series of workshops and analyses; developing operating manuals , field testing the&#13;
manuals, adopting revisions, distributing the operational manuals nationwide; and holding training&#13;
classes for court personnel and judges related to the new manuals.&#13;
Training&#13;
At present, there are no national training programs focusing on improving the administration of&#13;
the courts If the outlined reforms are to have an impact on the capacity of the judicial system, the&#13;
players in the system must be trained in the changes that have taken place. Classes will be&#13;
developed in the specific areas such as records management, use of forms, adhering to the&#13;
requirements of statistical reporting systems..&#13;
The training programs for judges will focus on defining the role of the judge in terms of his/her&#13;
management responsibilities in the case process and in particular to develop specific skills to&#13;
encourage judges to take a more active role in managing cases. Such training will be targeted at&#13;
trial level judges in Quito and Guayaquil. An in-depth evaluation of the initial training exercise&#13;
will be conducted so that the training can be expanded to all judges in later phases. Such later&#13;
phases could draw trainers from the initial group of judges. The broader problem of the lack of&#13;
training that judges receive both before and during their tenure in the judiciary is not being&#13;
addressed by the proposed project, but rather by an IDB project.&#13;
The development of the appropriate training materials will be an activity in this component.&#13;
These training materials will be made compatible with the operational manuals that will be&#13;
deveJoped so that the approach will be an integrated one. Techniques such as the use of&#13;
videotapes will be used to enhance the coverage of these training programs&#13;
Introduction of Automation and Technology in the Courts&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 44 -&#13;
The modernization of procedures, processes and organization will require a corresponding&#13;
modernization and introduction of modern technology, primarily automation, at the trial court&#13;
level- Currently, the trial courts do not have any automation, except for personal computers that&#13;
are purchased by individual judges with their own funds.&#13;
The automation program will be divided into two phases. The first will be to get basic&#13;
automation into the courts through the purchase of stand along personal computers and some&#13;
printers for the judges, secretaries and case processing support personnel in the courts in Quito&#13;
and Guayaquil. The equipment will be accompanied with standard word processing, data base&#13;
and spread sheet software. This configuration will allow the recipient of the equipment to become&#13;
functional on the equipment, once he or she completes the basic training in the use of this&#13;
software. The only linking of computers in the first phase will be for sharing of a high speed&#13;
printer in each court.&#13;
Providing basic training will be a part of the contract for the hardware. The training program&#13;
should consist of a minimum of one day on the operating system, two days for word processing,&#13;
one day for spread sheets and one day for data bases and should be specified in the contract. The&#13;
contractor will be required to maintain a person in the central information system office for a&#13;
period of three months after the equipment is delivered to answer technical questions. The&#13;
contract also will contain an element for the maintenance of the equipment for at least the first&#13;
two years since the court system does not have this internal capacity.&#13;
Once the equipment is in the courts with the basic software, consultants will develop with the&#13;
court programmers, court specific programs such as case tracking systems, automated registers,&#13;
and calendar management programs(See Annex 2).&#13;
The superior courts and first instance courts in Quito and Guayaquil consist of the following&#13;
distributions: in Quito there is a superior court, District courts (3) and first instance courts. The&#13;
number of personnel in these courts is approximately 450. In Guayaquil, there is a superior court,&#13;
District courts (3) and first instance courts. The number of personnel in these courts is&#13;
approximately 450 or a total of 900 employees.&#13;
Each court which generally consists of from one to three judges, a secretary and from four to six&#13;
case processing clerical support personnel will have a minimum of a computer for each judge, the&#13;
secretary and at least one of the clerical support personnel. Project financing will acquire&#13;
approximately 800 units of personal computers and 250 printers and the necessary equipment for&#13;
their operation. The estimation is that approximately 700 of the personal computers and 200&#13;
printers that are purchased will be destined to the courts in Quito and Guayaquil. The remainder&#13;
will be destined to support the programs that are initiated in courts outside of Quito and&#13;
Guayaquil in support of the activities under the Special Fund for Law and Justice.&#13;
The judicial personnel receiving computers will have to pass a test on the use of the computer&#13;
after the training and a probationary use period in order to retain it.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
In the second phase of the subcomponent, networks will be introduced in each court to allow for&#13;
sharing of information among staff within the court, but also to allow for linking with public&#13;
access computers to provide the public with access to case status information and also linking to&#13;
the central administrative offices for the purposes of reporting statistical information and&#13;
communications through electronic mail. The second phase will only be entered into once the&#13;
technology has be assimilated and is functioning well on a stand alone basis An evaluation will&#13;
have to be conducted at the end of the second year to determine if the second phase can be&#13;
implemented at that time as planned.&#13;
As a condition for disbursement of this component, the judicial branch will be required to&#13;
strengthen the central information technology office with at least two programmers&#13;
Management Information Systems&#13;
The Ecuadorian court system lacks the management information on which to base decisions&#13;
related to both the administration of the system and the management of the flow of cases. There&#13;
is a judicial statistics program and reports on filings and dispositions are sent by most but not all&#13;
courts as required by law. The rules for maintaining the data are unclear and interpreted&#13;
differently from court to court. Consequently, no one has confidence in the data, and the data is&#13;
not widely used in making management decisions. Allocation of new courts and personnel is&#13;
based more on political considerations than on the analysis of workload.&#13;
The objective of this element of the project is to improve the current statistical system. Such&#13;
improvement is a necessary complement to the other case administration measures being&#13;
conducted under the project.&#13;
Project activity should be divided into work to improve the current summary statistical system and&#13;
work to introduce case tracking systems which allow for powerful analysis of the causes of delay&#13;
and the location of bottlenecks in the system.&#13;
A technical commission will be established to oversee the project activities. A consultant will be&#13;
hired who, in conjunction with the technical commission, will conduct the following: review the&#13;
current statistical system relative to management information objectives and model judicial&#13;
management information systems in use or proposed for other Latin American systems;&#13;
summarize the statistics that are currently available into an annual report on judicial workload,&#13;
establish new reporting regulations, forms and instructions, conduct training for personnel&#13;
responsible to report to the manual statistical system; and introduce software to allow for&#13;
automated statistical reporting and for the distribution of data in an annual report.&#13;
Analysts will be hired to work in the national statistical office to ensure the accuracy of the&#13;
statistical system in use and to provide analysis of the data received to decision makers. The&#13;
management information system will be linked to the second phase of the automation program&#13;
when networks are established which will allow for taking the needed information directly from&#13;
the network&#13;

ANNEX 2: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR ACQUIRING THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE&#13;
INFORMATION SYSTEMS SUBCOMPONENT&#13;
Problem Statement&#13;
Most courts in Ecuador are not automated. Caseflow is managed in a manual form. The&#13;
information systems office in the national office consists of only six people and five of them have&#13;
been lent to other departments of the court. Furthermore, no one in the MIS department has a&#13;
programming background. As a consequence, little management information on the judicial and&#13;
administrative processes is available and the benefits of automation in developing and maintaining&#13;
tickler systems, calendars, and case histories are not available.&#13;
In addition to the lack of automation, the judges and employees at the trial court level lack basic&#13;
information necessary for their work. The courts no longer receive the Registro Oficial which is&#13;
the official means for laws and regulations to become effective. They also lack some of the&#13;
necessary codes. Ecuador has a LEXIS service which provides up to date information on the&#13;
codes, but at the trial court level this service is not available.&#13;
Background&#13;
The efficiency of courts is being improved throughout the world by the introduction of modem&#13;
information technology. Fortunately, as this technology expands, it is becoming cheaper and&#13;
therefore more accessible. Budgetary constraints and the ability to absorb the technology by its&#13;
users which in the past prevented the wide use of automation in the judicial processes are not so&#13;
overwhelming. It is possible to think about automating the courts, although careful study needs&#13;
to be undertaken to ensure that automation is introduced wisely.&#13;
Within the judicial framework, the areas ripe for automation are:&#13;
1.    Automating required registers&#13;
II.    Creating case history (registers of actions)&#13;
III.   Creating court calendars&#13;
IV.   Creating systems to trigger events such as court appearances&#13;
V.    Maintaining required judicial statistics&#13;
Establishing networks to make case status information available to the public and provide&#13;
management information&#13;
Given the current absence of standards, such standards need to be developed to guide the&#13;
purchase of equipment and software and priorities given to the different areas in the system in&#13;
terms of when they will be computerized.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
Other court systems in Latin America are starting to automate the judicial offices to assist with&#13;
caseflow.40&#13;
Solution&#13;
The judicial branch should introduce automation through a two phased approach in which in the&#13;
first phase stand alone computers are provided to the core staff in the Quito and Guayaquil trial&#13;
level courts. In order to achieve this objective, there needs to be an critical examination of&#13;
information system needs at the trial court level. This analysis should include the following.&#13;
1.     Review legal trends, caseload projections, proposed organizational changes to determine&#13;
how any of these trends will affect the need for and the distributions of automated systems in the&#13;
future.&#13;
2.     Define the applications for which automation is needed at the trial court level.&#13;
3.     Define the appropriate hardware and software that fills that need taking into&#13;
account:&#13;
a.     The cost and benefits of the introducing basic systems, and then&#13;
increasingly more sophisticated systems.&#13;
b.     The ability of the court system to absorb automated systems.&#13;
4. Analysis of the courts in Quito and Guayaquil that should receive automated and how many&#13;
each court would require with justifications.&#13;
5. Estimate the costs involved, presenting alternatives as appropriate.&#13;
6. Define the technical elements of the terms of reference for the public bidding for the&#13;
automated systems, software and training.&#13;
7. Oversee the installation and start-up of use of the computers.&#13;
8. Oversee the administration of a qualifying examination after a probationary period to ensure&#13;
that the users of the systems are actually using them.&#13;
In the second phase, which will probably commence two years after the first phase is&#13;
implemented, the stand along systems will begin to be linked into local area networks to allow for&#13;
40  The court system in Costa Rica just purchased 550 computers for judicial officcrs. Thcy arc very satisfied with&#13;
the equipment that they purchased and the specifications should be rclevant for the project in Ecuador. The&#13;
system that they purchased has the following characteristics: 486 DX2, 8MB of RAM. 340 MB hard drive.&#13;
color monitor and mouse. This equipment was Dell and had a unit price of S 1,700. The printcrs were&#13;
Compaq printers and had a unit cost of $350.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
the sharing of information internally, with the public regarding case status and with the national&#13;
administrative offices with information for the management information system.&#13;
The elements of the second phase will consist of&#13;
I Conducting an evaluation to ensure that the stand alone systems are functioning well and that&#13;
their users are capable of functioning on networks. A major element of this evaluation will be&#13;
to determine that the national information system office has developed the capacity or can&#13;
contract out the capacity to maintain a system of networks.&#13;
2. Determine the appropriate specifications for needed servers and requirements for telephone&#13;
lines&#13;
3 Prepare bidding documents for purchase of servers, installation, training and maintenance&#13;
necessary&#13;
4 Oversee the installation of the networks.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
The methodology employed should be based on a needs assessment of the current situation in the&#13;
courts that will participate in the World Bank program, review of the programs in neighboring&#13;
countries such as Chile, Colombia and Costa Rica that are underway to automate the courts,&#13;
proposals that already exist for introducing greater automation and assessments of the capacity of&#13;
ihe court system to absorb new technologies and at what levels of complexity.&#13;
Role of the Consultant&#13;
The consultant will assist in the development of the automation of information systems, working&#13;
under the guidance of representatives appointed by the court, and the implementation unit to&#13;
develop necessary materials including:&#13;
(a)    Statements of current status of automation in the participating courts.&#13;
(b)    Analysis of case management procedures that would benefit from greater&#13;
automation.&#13;
(c)    Description of the proposed level of automation including hardware, software and&#13;
training requirements.&#13;
(d)    Estimates of the requirements for equipment including preliminary cost estimates.&#13;
(e)    Technical elements of proposed Request for Proposal for the purchase of&#13;
hardware, software, installation, maintenance and training.&#13;
(f)    Proposed plan for both phase I and 2 for implementing the automation program.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
Profile of Consultant(s)&#13;
The consultant(s) will be an individual(s) or firm with expertise in automated systems and needs&#13;
assessments analyses in the field of automation. Experience in justice systems automation and&#13;
specifically judicial branch automation systems is highly desirable. The consultant may be either&#13;
national or international.&#13;
Reporting Requirements&#13;
The consultant(s) will provide the implementation unit with monthly progress reports. The final&#13;
report will be delivered for two week comment period. The consultant then will have an&#13;
additional two weeks to incorporate the comments and deliver the final reports.&#13;

ANNEX 4: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION&#13;
COMPONENT&#13;
Dispute resolution through Ecuador's judicial system has historically been slow and ineffective.&#13;
The average case processing time in courts of First Instance in Quito is approximately six years&#13;
Similar delays in the courts of First Instance are experienced country wide and delays continue&#13;
throughout the appeal process. Even when cases are finally adjudicated, there are significant&#13;
concerns regarding the fairness and effectiveness of the adjudicative process&#13;
The objective of the ADR components of the Ecuador Judicial Reform Project include: I)&#13;
education of the public at large and legal professionals about alternatives to judicial dispute&#13;
resolution and 2) provision of dispute resolution services as a complement to the regular legal&#13;
proceedings, whereby access to dispute resolution services will increase and court adjudication&#13;
delays will decrease.&#13;
The ADR component of the project will include two principle sub-components I) two court-&#13;
annexed pilot mediation programs, one in Quito and the other in Guayaquil and 2) research based&#13;
on date gathered by the pilot programs.&#13;
An ADR consulting firm and/or individual consultants (hereafter consultant(s)) will be needed to&#13;
provide technical assistance in a variety of areas. Consulting firms and/or individuals (hereafter&#13;
"consultants") will be selected based on background in ADR program design and implementation.&#13;
international ADR experience and Spanish language facility. A joint venture between&#13;
international and local consultants could be formed to perform the project activities&#13;
LEGISLATION REVIEW/REFORM&#13;
Consultants will verify that no legislative reform will be necessary to implement the court-annexed&#13;
mediation pilot program in Guayaquil and that a Supreme Court Resolution is necessary to&#13;
implement the pilot programs.&#13;
MEDIATION MODEL DESIGN&#13;
Pilot court-annexed mediation program models for implementation at the First Instance level in&#13;
Quito and Guayaquil have been developed by the working groups. Moreover, case selection for&#13;
the pilot programs has been completed (see specific terms of reference for the Quito and&#13;
Guayaquil pilot programs). In collaboration with the Quito and Guayaquil working groups,&#13;
consultants will develop procedural guidelines and a contractual framework in which the&#13;
mediations will take place.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

4. Mediator.Standards&#13;
Mediation and Mediators&#13;
Negotiation is a process through which parties with differences seek to achieve an agreement&#13;
without resort to legal process or other means. Mediators help parties achieve a voluntary&#13;
agreement by facilitating their negotiations. A mediator's role is therefore neutral, active and&#13;
creative Effective mediation depends upon skillful and knowledgeable mediators who understand&#13;
their role and limit their conduct by the requirements of their mandate.&#13;
Standards for Mediators&#13;
Mediators shall:&#13;
I. Recognize that mediation is based on principles of party independence and autonomy.&#13;
2. Always behave in a neutral manner.&#13;
3. Disclose any possible conflict of interest.&#13;
4. Mediate only in cases where qualified.&#13;
5. Maintain confidential all information learned in the course of the mediation, except where&#13;
expressly authorized to do so.&#13;
6. Explain clearly the meaning of the terms of the mediation agreement to be entered into&#13;
between the parties and satisfy themselves that the parties understand them.&#13;
7. Assist the parties to generate options and means for assessing them.&#13;
8. Mediate diligently and fairly.&#13;
9. Assist in the improvement of mediation in the courts of Ecuador.&#13;

In collaboration with the Quito and Guayaquil working groups, the consultant will conduct a&#13;
baseline study on the characteristics of cases currently pending in the Courts of First Instance&#13;
in Quito and Guayaquil. The study will include an analysis of the adjudicative process (i.e.&#13;
processing times, costs, outcomes, etc.). The methodology for this baseline study will be&#13;
developed prior to implementation of the pilot program.&#13;
2. Pilot Program Research Study&#13;
The consultant will design an ongoing research study to monitor the implementation of the&#13;
pilot program. As part of the design process, the consultant will collaborate with pilot staff,&#13;
the working groups and the project implementation unit to define project goals, develop a&#13;
computerized database to measure the program's effectiveness in achieving its stated goals&#13;
and to track general information about the nature of disputes mediated, as well as the&#13;
characteristics of program users.&#13;
The consultant will conduct formal research studies based on data compiled by the pilot&#13;
programs two years after implementation of the programs and at the conclusion of the pilot&#13;
project, with semi-annual reviews of the progress of the study. Results of the research study&#13;
will be published and presented at conferences held two years after pilot implementation and&#13;
at the conclusion of the pilot project. The consultant will also provide technical assistance to&#13;
the pilot staff for purposes of producing interim report with which mediation services and&#13;
procedures will be evaluated, and as needed, modified.&#13;
3. Pilot Staff Research Training&#13;
The consultant will provide technical assistance to the pilot staff in data collection techniques,&#13;
computer input methods and monthly and quarterly interim report generation.&#13;
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS&#13;
The consultant will provide the Project Coordination Unit with quarterly progress reports. A final&#13;
report will be delivered to the PCU at the end of the pilot project.&#13;

ANNEX 5: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE ALTERNATIVE DISPUTE RESOLUTION&#13;
COMPONENT --GUAYAQUIL AND QUITO&#13;
I.  BACKGROUND&#13;
Dispute resolution through the judicial system is slow and inefficient. Duration of civil processes&#13;
in first instance is excessive. Although procedural codes provide for compulsory mediation during&#13;
trial (conciliation hearing) the results of this system have been limited due to lack of interest of the&#13;
parties and the lawyers, neither the judges, responsible for mediation, assume an active role for&#13;
that purpose.&#13;
II.    PILOT PLAN&#13;
The objective is to establish in Guayaquil and Quito mediation programs for civil and landlord-&#13;
tenant cases. More specifically, it has been decided that the following types of cases would be&#13;
subjected to the pilot program: landlord-tenant (inquilinato), familial, labor disputes. The expected&#13;
outcome of the pilot exercise is clear demonstration of the potential for ADR to provide timely,&#13;
efficient, and equitable justice in a means that provides an alternative to the traditional court-&#13;
sponsored judicial system, and that can serve as a means for reducing the case load and burden on&#13;
the court system.&#13;
II1. SHORT PROGRAM DESCRIPTION&#13;
To accomplish these objectives, a mediation program will be established, and a Centro de&#13;
Conciliaci6n will be established within the Superior Court building in Guayaquil and staffed by the&#13;
following: an administrator, two senior mediators (specializing in different types of cases), two&#13;
mediation/administration assistants, several law students on a part-time and voluntary basis, and a&#13;
secretary.&#13;
3.1    MEDIATION MODEL DESIGN&#13;
Two models for the entry of a case to the mediation center are contemplated:&#13;
Model 1: Utilizing Existing Faculties of Judge Conciliation&#13;
(a)    Upon entry of a case (demanda) to the court, the case is assigned to a judge and a&#13;
specific court.&#13;
(b)   The presiding judge cites the other party to appear for the "audiencia de&#13;
conciliaci6n". If conciliation does not occur before the judge, the case is placed in&#13;
suspension and referred to the Centro/Oficina de Conciliacion The Oficina,&#13;
consisting of a multi-disciplinary attempts to reconcile.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
(c)    If conciliation is achieved the case is referred to the presiding judge for&#13;
signature/approval. If conciliation is not achieved, the case is returned to the&#13;
active case file of the judge.&#13;
Model 2: Fast Track Model through Assigned Judge&#13;
(a)    As in Option 1, the case enters the system and is referred to a specific judge.&#13;
(b)    At the time that the other party is cited, the case is referred directly to the Oficina&#13;
de Conciliaci6n by the judge and placed in suspension on the calendar of the court&#13;
pending action by the Oficina.&#13;
(c)    As is true above in Ic, conciliation either occurs or the case is returned to the&#13;
docket.&#13;
Model 3: Mediation before and during proceedings&#13;
At any time before or after the presentation of a law suit before the judiciary, the mediation&#13;
offices may offer their services to conciliate a dispute according to the relevant rules that will be&#13;
produced for this model.&#13;
As part of the consultant responsibilities, the preparation of model mediation contracts, an&#13;
operating manual for the center, and the establishment of the case management/record keeping&#13;
system for the center should be completed within the first two months of the establishment of the&#13;
center&#13;
3.2  SELECTION OF CASES TO BE HANDLED THROUGH CONCILIATION&#13;
The consensus is that the current civil code allows for the audiencia de conciliaci6n for all cases;&#13;
however, a subset of civil actions including labor conflicts, landlord-tenant disputes, and familial&#13;
matters (including child support) are to be considered for all first instance (civil) courts in&#13;
Guayaquil In Quito selected courts (one civil and one landlord-tenant for first year) would&#13;
handle conciliation cases of execution processes, cautionary processes or preventive measures&#13;
would be exempt from Quito pilot.&#13;
3.3 TRAINING OF JUDGES AND THE MEDIATION TEAM&#13;
Guavaquil&#13;
The preparation of an initial overview seminar on ADR, to be attended by judges, lawyers, NGO&#13;
representatives, and other relevant parties, will be the responsibility of the University-based&#13;
conciliation center in Guayaquil. The initial two-day seminar, to occur in late February, 1996,&#13;
was attended by all judges (first-instance and superior court) in Guayaquil, selected&#13;
representatives from the legal community (e.g., Colegio de Abogados, university faculties), and&#13;
members of the community more generally interested in ADR (e.g., the press). Preparation of&#13;
materials for the seminar, selection of speakers, format for discussions, etc. are the responsibility&#13;
of the local consultant, Consultorio Juridico, to arrange. A proposal which will include selection&#13;
of themes, selection of principal speakers/panels, the development of seminar materials,&#13;
advertising for the seminar and selection of attendees, and administration of the seminar will be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
submitted by the consultant to the Coordinating Unit. The seminar was held at the Catholic&#13;
University of Guayaquil and with the close collaboration of the faculty of the University. A&#13;
similar Seminar will be organized in Quito.&#13;
Subsequent to the initial seminar there will be a second training exercise, a set of eight hour&#13;
workshops for all (civil) judges of First Instance and Superior Court (May/June, 1996) will occur.&#13;
The management and operation of these training workshops will e the responsibility of a&#13;
contracted firm with experience in training in ADR and will benefit from the counterpart&#13;
participation of the local Consultorio Juridico for preparation.&#13;
Finally, a more intensive training workshop will be prepared for First Instance judges and for&#13;
administrative (Oficina de Conciliaci6n and other relevant court-related, e.g. secretarios) staff.&#13;
Operating and referral manuals, guidelines, and relevant additional training material will be&#13;
prepared by the consultant group and the Consultorio, subject to collaboration with the WG and&#13;
review/approval by the court and the Bank. This third workshop would occur in the second half&#13;
of 1996, subsequent to the establishment of the Oficina and the selection of staff.&#13;
It is anticipated that other training workshops for university faculty and students will be prepared&#13;
during the project. A seminar with judges not involved in the pilot program will be carried out in&#13;
Quito in order to increase their understanding.&#13;
Quito&#13;
The mediation team will be composed of four mediator lawyers, four or six articling students and&#13;
two secretaries.&#13;
The mediators will analyze the cases referred. In the beginning of the pilot program, they will not&#13;
be specialized in any of the areas selected. They will receive a salary equivalent to at least that of&#13;
a first instance judge (approximately S$84,000), attractive enough to qualified candidates but not&#13;
as excessive as to generate objections within the judiciary. Since the mediators will not be&#13;
members of the judiciary, a NGO may be hired to manage their labor relations.&#13;
Last year law students may act as supporting staff, assisting the negotiating teams, delivering&#13;
notices, collecting information, summoning the parties, etc. Articling students will be subject to&#13;
an special Act and as a consequence are only entitled to a basic remuneration and not subject to&#13;
any labor relation. This activity may receive some academic recognition through agreements with&#13;
the law faculties.&#13;
The pilot program would also require two secretaries, one for typing and the other for reception&#13;
and telephones. Their salary would be market determined and they would enter into a labor&#13;
relation with a NGO or a temps company.&#13;
TEAM SELECTION&#13;
Twelve young lawyers will be invited to a mediation training course. They would be selected by&#13;
the working group in coordination with the Supreme Court. They will participate in a seminar-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
workshop for mediators and the four that demonstrate the highest qualifications will be selected&#13;
for the pilot program. The others may participate in the program at a later stage. The seminar-&#13;
workshop may last between 36 and 40 hours and will be given by mediation specialists locally&#13;
available after the introduction of community mediation and indigenous groups mediation&#13;
programs.&#13;
The articling students will be selected by the working group in coordination with the Law&#13;
Faculties of Catholic University and Central University. The working group would select directly&#13;
the secretaries&#13;
CASE-FLOW&#13;
The selected judges, at the time of the preliminary review of the lawsuit will forward a copy to the&#13;
mediation office. Once the copy is received, it will be assigned to one of the mediators. He or&#13;
she will analyze the claim and, if appropriate, will start the mediation process. He or she may also&#13;
determine that this is not feasible and will advise the judge accordingly.&#13;
The mediator will then contact the parties and advise about the advantages of reaching a&#13;
settlement through mediation. If both parties so agree, they may jointly request the judge to&#13;
suspend the judicial deadlines. Except in extraordinary cases, the mediator will not devote more&#13;
than a certain number of hours to a specific case; the parties, however, may continue indefinitely&#13;
in their private negotiations.&#13;
TRAINING&#13;
Training courses will be prepared for:&#13;
* judges selected for the pilot program&#13;
This training (approximately 12 hours) would be carried out directly by the working group so as&#13;
to involve the selected judges in its activities.&#13;
* other civil and landlord-tenant judges&#13;
The Supreme Court will offer a seminar to explain the pilot program.&#13;
* potential mediators&#13;
Mediation training experts will conduct a seminar-workshop of about 36 hours.&#13;
*  articling students&#13;
Mediation training experts would also conduct a workshop of about 12 hours.&#13;
* Lawyers&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
Training may disseminate among the legal community the benefits of the mediation program so as&#13;
to avoid that it takes a negative position against it. The working group would coordinate with the&#13;
bar association one or two lectures on mediation in general and the pilot program.&#13;
3.4   INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
Guavaouil&#13;
It has been agreed with the Superior Court of Guayaquil that remodeled space will be provided&#13;
for the Centro de Conciliaci6n within the Superior Court building. These offices will include (as a&#13;
minimum) two mediation rooms/offices for the principal mediators, an office for the administrator,&#13;
and central open office and reception space for client access and for remaining staff members.&#13;
Office equipment (computers, printer) and materials will be supplied by the project, and other&#13;
equipment (telephone, furniture, etc.) will be supplied by the court.&#13;
Ouito&#13;
The pilot program will have an office, either within the judicial function building or nearby, with&#13;
three or four mediation rooms and office equipment (including computers, printers and&#13;
telephones) for all the personnel, under the "pool office" model.&#13;
IV. COMPOSITION OF THE WORKING GROUP&#13;
Guavaguil&#13;
The Working Group held its first meeting in May, 1995 and has been active since. At the initial&#13;
meeting Dra Mariana Argudo was elected unanimously as the WG coordinator. In that role,&#13;
Dra. Argudo has been the key counterpart to the Bank and the Coordinating Unit in the&#13;
preparation of the ADR/Guayaquil component. The members of the Working Group are:&#13;
Dra. Mariana Argudo, Professor, Catholic University&#13;
Dr. Alfredo Contreras, President, Superior Court of Guayaquil&#13;

5.    Rodrigo Jijon, Vicedean of Catholic University of Quito.&#13;
6.    Ramiro Avila Santamaria, CIDES&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
Additionally, the working group should prepare a booklet containing basic information on&#13;
mediation and the pilot program. These booklets should be distributed among lawyers and law&#13;
students&#13;
V.    TIMETABLE&#13;
The pilot program is expected to be in operation for two years in both Quito and Guayaquil- If&#13;
the pilot exercise is successful, it is expected that the assumption of responsibilities for the&#13;
operation of the Center and its staff will become incorporated in the administrative and&#13;
operational activities of the Superior Court, including budget. The overall timetable of the&#13;
various activities under the pilot program is described in the initial portion of this annex. Key&#13;
activities and their targeted timetable for Guayaquil include:&#13;

ANNEX 6: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE PROGRAM FOR LAW AND JUSTICE COMPONENT&#13;
Context&#13;
The Government's Judicial Reform Program's goals are wide-ranging and touch all aspects of the&#13;
legal system. To assist the Program to achieve its goals and to lay the groundwork for future&#13;
action it has been decided that a Program for Law and Justice will be created with specified&#13;
program components as well as demand driven programs. Initiatives sponsored by the Program&#13;
will be carried out by individuals, courts, public institutions involved in the administration of&#13;
justice, and non-governmental, not-for-profit agencies that are committed to the enhancement of&#13;
the economic and social reality of the country. These persons and groups, representing a cross-&#13;
section of grass roots and community interests, will thus become the government's partners in the&#13;
search for practical and achievable means to facilitate commerce and social conditions through&#13;
justice based programs.&#13;
The Program for Law and Justice is primarily aimed at addressing problems of access to justice,&#13;
law research and reform, legal education and information, and court reform through&#13;
modernization and decentralization, through a variety of individual projects that address particular&#13;
needs as well as provide a basis for demand driven activities.&#13;
Subcomponents&#13;
The Program has six main subcomponents:&#13;
I- The Special Fund for Law and Justice&#13;
2. Program for the Professional Development of Judicial Trainers&#13;
3. Statistical Study on the State of Ecuadorian Legal Education&#13;
4. Movable and Immovable Property Registration Study&#13;
5. Alternative Dispute Resolution Evaluation Study&#13;
6. Legal Services Pilots&#13;
The detailed terms of reference and structure of activities for these subcomponents are attached as&#13;
attachments&#13;
1. The Special Fund for Law and Justice in Ecuador&#13;
The Special Fund for Law and Justice in Ecuador will he charged with the responsibility for&#13;
establishing and monitoring the non-governmental initiatives of the Project. Over time the&#13;
Fund may wish to consider becoming self-sustaining thus playing a permanent role in the&#13;
ongoing process of improvement of the justice system. To this end the Fund will seek&#13;
additional sources of funding for its work and will cooperate with funders interested in the&#13;
achievement of common objectives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
The Fund will solicit proposals for activities that fall within its remit after commencement of&#13;
the Project. Once established, it will also then monitor and evaluate the subcomponents&#13;
numbered 2, 3, and 4 above which are described briefly below&#13;
Mission&#13;
To be a leading proponent and supporter of activities that:&#13;
* seek to achieve the goals of the Judicial Reform Program&#13;

* support and assist the legal system in its efforts to be fair, affordable, responsive, efficient&#13;
and appropriate to the needs of all citizens.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
To promote enhanced access to justice, law reform and research, court reform (through&#13;
modernization and decentralization) and improve the quality of legal education and&#13;
infornmation for all persons in Ecuador through:&#13;
I  facilitating access to legal and related services;&#13;
2. improving the operation and accessibility of the law and the legal system by promoting&#13;
reform and structural change;&#13;
3. collecting, assessing and disseminating information on all aspects of the law and the legal&#13;
system,&#13;

9. projects aimed at improving the courts through modernization and decentralization&#13;
activities carried out by courts committed to reform; and&#13;
10. doing anything incidental to or conducive to the achievement of these objectives.&#13;
These objectives will be pursued through four sub-programs of the Fund:&#13;
1. Legal Education and Information,&#13;
2. Access to Justice, and&#13;
3. Law Research and Reform.&#13;
4. Court Reform (decentralization and modernization)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
Programs I to 4 will receive approximately equal priority in the making of grants. Program 4. may&#13;
receive a higher priority, depending on need. Projects that advance more than one program area&#13;
of the Fund may be given higher priority for funding.&#13;
2. Program for Professional Development&#13;
The aim of this subcomponent is to improve knowledge, skills and attitudes of judicial trainers&#13;
so as to enable them to improve the overall quality of judicial education and training in the&#13;
country It is aimed at enhancing teaching and learning skills as well as at improving judicial&#13;
trainers'general knowledge of relevant legal and related subjects. The program will be&#13;
convened and managed by the Faculty of Law at the Catholic University of Quito which will&#13;
establish a management plan and structure as indicated in the terms of reference. A&#13;
representative group of committed and competent judicial trainers will be prepared to become&#13;
field trainers for country-wide program. (Annex 10)&#13;
3. Statistical Study on the State of Ecuadorian Legal Education&#13;
Educational reform in Ecuador seems indicated in many areas. However, there is insufficient&#13;
hard information to guide any systematic, systemic reform that might be desirable. As a&#13;
result, a statistical study of university level legal education will be conducted to generate a&#13;
country wide profile of the situation. The information gathered in the study will be presented&#13;
to the Ecuadorian professoriate during a professional development conference called for the&#13;
purpose in both Guayaquil and Quito involving law teachers and law school administrators&#13;
and others interested in legal education. Side benefits of the work may include the&#13;
establishment of closer relations among law schools and teachers. (Annex 11)&#13;
4. Progranm for the Modernization of Property Registration&#13;
Commerce is facilitated by clear, accessible and reliable systems of property rights&#13;
registration  Modernization of the current system is essential if an efficient market is to be&#13;
established for real and personal property. Under this study the current system will be&#13;
analyzed and evaluated with a view to assessing its regulatory framework's utility. The final&#13;
product will include recommendations for legal and administrative reform. It will also chart&#13;
the steps necessary to implementing a new and effective regime. (Annex 9)&#13;
5. ADR Evaluation Study&#13;
The court connected mediation Guayaquil and Quito pilot program component of the Project will&#13;
provide much needed experience and information on the role of alternatives to adjudication within&#13;
the context of the litigation process. A study will be conducted on the pilot programs to monitor&#13;
implementation. However, these pilots will not provide nationwide inputs into the further&#13;
development of dispute resolution alternatives in the country and the focus on only mediation, just&#13;
one form of dispute resolution. A study that considers a variety of dispute resolution alternatives&#13;
in the context of the full range of civil, administrative and regulatory cases will enable planners to&#13;
systematically develop a dispute resolution program in priority areas. (Annex 4)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
6. Legal.Services Pilots&#13;
A person may not appear in the civil courts without a lawyer. Lack of a lawyer may result in an&#13;
effectively inaccessible legal system for persons with bonafide legal positions. A legal defense&#13;
fund will be created to provide legal services to indigent women in non criminal areas of legal&#13;
service. The fund will be managed by a non-governmental organization specialized in the&#13;
provision of legal defense services under the supervision of the Special Fund. The contract may&#13;
also include provision of technical and computer assistance by the Fund. (Annex 12)&#13;
Conclusion&#13;
The Program for Law and Justice in Ecuador provides a flexible and wide-ranging approach to&#13;
addressing diverse problems in the Ecuadorian justice system.&#13;

ANNEx 8: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE PROPERTY RIGHTS - IMMOVABLE AND MOVABLE&#13;
REGISTRIES MODERNIZATION SUBCOMPONENT FOR THE PROGRAM FOR LAW AND JUSTICE&#13;
The objective of a program on property registry modernization is to formalize property ownership&#13;
(urban and rural) by providing secure property rights. Secure property rights imply good private&#13;
or public contracting duly registered in a secure manner, a good legal system, and a solvent&#13;
financial system. The registration system should help to regularize property ownership. A&#13;
sustainable system of property regularization sharply decreases transaction costs promoting an&#13;
efficient property market.&#13;
Ecuador has a very high percentage of unregistered property that lies outside the formal system of&#13;
ownership. In Quito about 40% of the rural and 30% of the urban immovable properties are&#13;
unregistered. In Guayaquil about 45% urban and 80% rural are unregistered. The majority of&#13;
property transactions are not registered because the registration requirements are costly and most&#13;
title documentation inaccurate. We observe that the knowledge of property ownership shared in&#13;
the community level is not transferred to the formal system of property rights. Similarly, registries&#13;
for movable properties suffer from barriers to entry, institutional bottlenecks and administrative&#13;
rigidities that do not allow their proper development.&#13;
A study of the immovable and movable property rights structure and property registries will be&#13;
conducted. The study will recommend reform policies for property formalization with a view to&#13;
promote an efficient property market.&#13;
Outputs of the study&#13;
I. A thorough analysis and evaluation of the problem of formalization of immovable and&#13;
movable property.&#13;

1. First Stage: Evaluation and analysis&#13;
Objectives:   To identify all institutional and legal obstacles to formalization of immovable&#13;
property and of delineation of movable property using field work.&#13;
To establish coordination links with the appropriate institutions.&#13;
Activities:&#13;
(a) Construct flow charts of costs and administrative constraints to formalize property.&#13;
D  Identification of the different kinds of informal ownership in the country, urban and&#13;
rural (immovable). Study of the informal property conditions, the informal rules and&#13;
its interaction with the formal rules, and the institutional structure of the registries.&#13;
This activity will imply a thorough field work.&#13;
-  Identify the formal obstacles to access the registries (immovable and movable).&#13;
Analysis of the formal legal framework. Definition of property rights, process of legal&#13;
adjudication and registration.&#13;
(b) Identification of the public agencies responsible for the administration of the laws.&#13;
Identification of private sector agents that may affect the process of formalization.&#13;
(immovable and movable)&#13;
(c) Market value analysis of the registries' existing output. This analysis involves the&#13;
evaluation of legal security of the existing registration system.&#13;
(d) Analysis of the availability and usefulness of registered property, property maps indexation&#13;
records, and of the existing technical environment.&#13;
2. Second Stage: Design Of The Institutional Reform: Legal And Technical Design The&#13;
National Strategy For Registration Including An Active Field Work&#13;
Objectives:  To analyze and simplify the institutional procedures required for property&#13;
formalization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 86 -&#13;
To develop the principal legal reform proposals.&#13;
To development of the principal technical reforms.&#13;
To develop a National Strategy for Registration (formalization).&#13;
Activities:&#13;
Legal Reforms:&#13;
(a) Draft the proposal for new administrative and legal processes to delineate property rights.&#13;
This activity includes statutes, regulations and rules for administrative simplification&#13;
eliminating cumbersome and irrelevant registration requirements and procedures, as well&#13;
as legal and institutional duplication, and a proposal of how the registry could become the&#13;
formalization agency and its coordination with the other agencies.&#13;
(b) The law proposal and policy recommendations will be consulted with the users and&#13;
beneficiaries, as well as, with the entities that will apply the laws.&#13;

registration process.&#13;
(e) Prepare the terms of reference for the mapping contractor.&#13;
(f) Develop the information index technology that will be used for registration (parcel&#13;
indexation). Design of a computer system that will allow formalization to begin in the&#13;
priority areas right after the reform law is passed. Customize the computer registry&#13;
systems, design the prototype computer system (develop the software) and prepare the&#13;
terms of reference for the computer contractor. The system must be built on the results of&#13;
the investigation and the subsequent recommendations.&#13;
(g) Design the implementation strategy for a national program of registration. Design field&#13;
work, administrative conflict resolution, technical legal and physical verification,&#13;
community based information gathering, cadastral update. Priority areas of operation are&#13;
to be defined in order to provide the momentum for the reform.&#13;
International Seminar in Quito. It will present the Ecuadorian reality and recommendations&#13;

ANNEX 9: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM&#13;
SUBCOMPONENT FOR THE PROGRAM FOR LAW AND JUSTICE&#13;
Background&#13;
The Ecuadorian professoriate is made up of dedicated practicing lawyers and judges who make&#13;
time in their demanding schedules to assist the current and next generation of legal professionals&#13;
to acquire the knowledge, skills and professional attitudes necessary to enable them to enter the&#13;
judicial career and/or become judicial trainers. rhe professoriate is thus composed of committed&#13;
and talented amateurs who contribute to their profession and the public through the sharing of&#13;
learning. Such persons cannot of course be expected to be educated in the principles and&#13;
practices of adult higher learning.&#13;
Anecdotal evidence that is frequently offered suggests that there is a need for improvement in the&#13;
quality of instruction offered in the country's legal and judicial training. In addition, there is&#13;
remarkable interest among legal and judicial trainers in becoming knowledgeable and skilled adult&#13;
educators.&#13;
Project Aim&#13;
To improve the quality of training skills in Ecuador through the improvement of the knowledge,&#13;
skills and attitudes of legal trainers focused in the area of judicial training and procedural matters&#13;
across the country.&#13;
Project Objectives&#13;
At the end of the program participants will be able to train judicial officers:&#13;
I. know the main theories and practices pertinent to teaching law,&#13;
2. employ various teaching methods effectively,&#13;
3. use aids and devices to support their teaching;&#13;
4. communicate effectively in a variety of teaching contexts,&#13;
5. design teaching materials,&#13;
6. know and be able to carry out several research methodologies;&#13;
7. be aware of developments in legal theory, sociology of law, and professional training;&#13;
8. contribute to curriculum and course development.&#13;

ANNEX I0: TERMS OF REFERENCE FOR THE STATE OF LEGAL EDUCATION SUBCOMPONENT&#13;
FOR THE PROGRAM FOR LAW AND JUSTICE&#13;
Background&#13;
Legal study is very popular in Ecuador. To meet demand each major center in the country has at&#13;
least one law school and frequently more. Access to university level study is relatively easy in&#13;
both the private and public sectors. The attrition rate also appears high, so relatively few who&#13;
enter ever graduate. In addition, there are more graduates than professional career opportunities.&#13;
There is also some question about both the adequacy of the resourcing and the quality of legal&#13;
education. The wide access system may be causing teaching institutions to stretch resources in&#13;
ways that undermine quality for the sake of quantity.&#13;
The legal system depends heavily on law graduates to conduct some of its most important roles.&#13;
Their quality as public servants and protectors of individual interests is of course placed in doubt&#13;
if educational and training structures, systems and processes are inadequate.&#13;
No one knows the current state of legal education in Ecuador. There are no national statistical&#13;
records that provide a basis for preliminary assessments or comparisons. Absent these data,&#13;
minimum standards for operations or graduates' capabilities cannot realistically be established,&#13;
thus permitting the doubt about quality to continue. In the result, the public that pays for legal&#13;
education and those who pay the fees of private institutions to obtain legal qualifications, are not&#13;
able to examine information that would assure them that graduates meet minimum standards upon&#13;
graduation Nor can clients of new graduates be certain that their lawyers can deliver value for&#13;
money.&#13;
Goal&#13;
To establish base-line statistics that can be maintained and reviewed on a regular basis with a view&#13;
using them to formulate minimum acceptable standards for legal education in Ecuador.&#13;
Objectives&#13;
I To gather information on all items referred to on attachment "A", together with such other&#13;
information as may be determined to be of value, from all law schools in the country.&#13;
2. To establish an information exchange among and between Ecuadorian law schools.&#13;
3. To establish a mechanism for an annual report on the state of legal education in the country.&#13;
4. To consider further action that may be desirable in improving the quality of legal education.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -&#13;
Method&#13;
A research study will be conducted by a consultant using a combination of information gathering&#13;
techniques, including questionnaires and interviews. A working group of Law School Deans will&#13;
participate in the implementation of the study. The results will be summarized using comparative&#13;
tables and prose. The results should be disseminated to all law schools, all participants, and any&#13;
interested persons upon request.&#13;
Project Management and Conduct&#13;
The project will be established and monitored by a three person management committee&#13;
established by the PCU, perhaps in consultation with a law school. The committee will report to&#13;
the PCU One member of the committee will be a law Dean, another member will be a person&#13;
experienced in studies of this kind, the third member should be a person with a wide knowledge of&#13;
legal education in Ecuador.&#13;
The management committee will hire and supervise a consultant with a background in social&#13;
science and statistical research methods who will propose a study design for committee review&#13;
and approval The consultant may be an individual or a firm. The consultant shall carry out all&#13;
the project activities under the supervision of the committee. The committee will be responsible&#13;
for dissemination of results through a publication and at least two seminars, one in each of Quito&#13;
and Guayaquil.&#13;

ANNEX 1 1: LEGAL SERVICES PILOTS -- LEGAL SERVICES FOR INDIGENT WOMEN&#13;
Background and Context&#13;
As in most other countries, the burdens of poverty in Ecuador are borne most pervasively and&#13;
with the greatest negative effects by single women with children. A recent World Bank study on&#13;
poverty in the country establishes clearly that these women as the poorest persons in the country.&#13;
(see Ecuador Poverty Report (Report No. 14533-EC, World Bank, November 1995). In general,&#13;
women's economic circumstances are poor compared to men. Their security is threatened daily,&#13;
never being sure that their needs for food, shelter or clothing will be met. Such desperate lives&#13;
make every day life a manifest struggle.&#13;
Their need to care for children frequently makes gainful employment by them impossible. In fact,&#13;
according to the Report 38% of all poor urban women cannot participate in the workforce&#13;
because of household or childcare duties. Where work is available and they are free to undertake&#13;
it, they are frequently unable to do so due to a want of skills and knowledge. Opportunities for&#13;
education, training and other means to advancement are few and tied to their financial insecurity.&#13;
This is further impeded when there are single family households headed by women. Their children&#13;
are thus accorded fewer opportunities to grow and develop into effective and autonomous&#13;
contributors to personal, social and economic well-being. Economic contributions by poor women&#13;
are few and unlikely to increase without the flexibilities in living that come from greater financial&#13;
independence&#13;
In some cases when these women are entitled to support from the fathers of their children there&#13;
are no means of securing these entitlements. The law that exists to protect these women and their&#13;
offspring is rarely accessed by them because they do not have the economic means to secure their&#13;
legal rights&#13;
There is no well-developed, specialist legal service that responds to the real social, economic,&#13;
personal and legal needs of this segment of the population.&#13;
Execution&#13;
The Legal Services Pilots for Indigent Women will seek to begin to meet this huge unmet need.&#13;
Under it the Project Coordination Unit (PCU) will contract with a service provider to engage in&#13;
the activities that will achieve the objectives set out and described below. Organizations seeking&#13;
to provide the services described in this document will be required to provide a detailed budget&#13;
and schedule for implementation as well as other material described below. The PCU will liaise&#13;
closely with all potential providers. As noted below, the successful party will be required to&#13;
monitor progress towards carefully specified project goals.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -&#13;
Goal&#13;
Pilot projects to test feasibility of contracting legal services for indigent women. These pilots will&#13;
aim to provide legal and complementary services to qualified women and their children so as to&#13;
enable them to obtain and secure their legal entitlements and begin to take action that will&#13;
improve their socio-economic positions.&#13;
Typical Activities&#13;
The following activities provide a statement of the minimum expectations for this program.&#13;
Applicants may suggest additional objectives with a rationale for each. If a particular item that&#13;

ANNEX 12: IMPROVEMENT OF THE PHYSICAL FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE&#13;
COMPONENTS&#13;
Problem Statement&#13;
The physical facilities of the courts in Ecuador represent a serious impediment to the effective&#13;
administration of justice. Many of the facilities are housed in buildings which were not designed&#13;
for court use. Some facilities designed for court use reflect the functioning of the judicial system&#13;
from a lower volume, more symbolic era and do not work well in today's high volume, resolution&#13;
oriented system.&#13;
The introduction of oral proceedings may add another variable for which the physical facilities of&#13;
the judicial branch must be adapted. The programming of the physical resources does not appear&#13;
to follow a well analyzed and rational path.&#13;
Background&#13;
The importance of physical facilities to the effective administration of justice has increasingly been&#13;
recognized, the courthouse has evolved from an almost symbolic public structure to a true dispute&#13;
resolution center which offers a variety of forums to resolve disputes, e.g., full trials with high&#13;
security issues, arbitration and informal mediation.&#13;
As the demands on the judicial system have increased, court planners have increasingly focused on&#13;
the need to have the physical facilities of the judicial branch better reflect the needs of the judges,&#13;
non-judicial personnel and the users. The requirements for security, the use of automation, the&#13;
greater volume of people using the system all have placed great strain on the traditional design of&#13;
a courthouse In Ecuador and other Latin American countries, the movement toward oral&#13;
hearings from written proceedings and towards the decentralization of administrative functions is&#13;
creating a series of design problems that must be addressed in defining the courthouse of the&#13;
future.&#13;
In Ecuador, no similar standards, guidelines and planning tools exist for the design of court&#13;
facilities. The planning department and the architecture section have conducted studies of the&#13;
current situation and needs. Those analyzes have some information on square footage in current&#13;
buildings. In general, however there is no common agreement as to the ideal layout of a court or&#13;
what minimum square footage requirements are needed for the various functions. The result is a&#13;
wide disparity of designs which often hinder the administration of justice.&#13;
In addition, there is no master plan for the development of judicial facilities. The planning&#13;
department has developed a comprehensive list of the facilities requiring remodeling and updating,&#13;
but this list needs to be incorporated into an overall long range plan which addresses the issues of&#13;
how the court system proposes to implement the constitutional mandate to decentralize&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102-&#13;
government, what standards for each level of court should be applied in designing or remodeling&#13;
buildings.&#13;
Solution&#13;
In order to overcome the infrastructure problems, the judicial branch needs to develop a long term&#13;
facilities plan and address some high priority facility needs&#13;
1.     Five Year Development Plan&#13;
A five year development plan will be developed that incorporates the following:&#13;
I.    Impact of legal trends, caseload projections and proposed organizational changes on the&#13;
planning for court facilities in the future, e.g., decentralization.&#13;
II.    Square footage, infrastructure, and design norms to use in programming and designing new&#13;
facilities.&#13;
III    Design guidelines for programming facilities to ensure that new facilities meet the needs of&#13;
their users.&#13;
IV.   Priorities for facility construction and remodeling over the next five years.&#13;
Methodology&#13;
To achieve the above solution, research into the current status of court facilities in Ecuador will&#13;
be conducted under the project and the development of design and planning guidelines will be&#13;
addressed. To do the work a survey of selected court buildings in use will be undertaken to&#13;
assess their adequacy and deficiencies. The work of the planning office in surveying the current&#13;
condition of court facilities will assist in this work.&#13;
Discussions will be held on the definition of appropriate models for the future. These discussions&#13;
should include judicial and non-judicial officials, architects and planners, private lawyers,&#13;
prosecutors and public defenders, security and representatives of the various other users of the&#13;
facilities named to an advisory committee. As a result of this work, planning guidelines, model&#13;
designs, square footage and minimum infrastructure requirements for court facilities should be&#13;
adopted. The different requirements for the different levels of courts-supreme, superior,&#13;
administrative and tax courts, and first instance courts as well as types of jurisdictions, e.g., civil,&#13;
criminal, juvenile, must be noted. There may also be differences between rural and urban courts.&#13;
Throughout study of emerging legal trends that will have an impact on the design of facilities will&#13;
have to be conducted. The most obvious is the use of oral proceedings, but there are others also.&#13;
The increased use of alternative dispute resolution techniques will create new design&#13;
requirements. The adoption of the concept of a centralized clerks office, as many Latin America&#13;
courts are considering, also has major implications for the design of facilities.&#13;
The norms and standards should be adopted by the Supreme Court of the Consejo de la&#13;
Magistratura to guide future planning for the construction and remodeling of facilities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 103 -&#13;
Role of the Consultant&#13;
The consultant will assist in the development of the above process by assisting the central&#13;
administration to develop necessary materials including:&#13;
Preliminary statement of infrastructure needs (equipment required for each court level including&#13;
furniture, written materials, office equipment, etc.)&#13;
Preliminary standards of square footage requirements for court facilities&#13;
Model court facilities layouts for the different court levels.&#13;
Preliminary statements of court facility requirements with cost estimates. This statement will&#13;
include priorities for courts in need of the greatest improvements. This will be based on travel to&#13;
selected courts and review with the officials in the central administrative offices.&#13;
A final report will be written and sent to the Project Coordinating Unit within ten days of&#13;
completion of the mission.&#13;
Profile of Consultant(s)&#13;
The consultant(s) will be an individual(s) or firm with expertise in facility planning and needs&#13;
assessment analyses in the field. Experience in the design and construction of judicial branch&#13;
facilities is essential The consultant ma be either national or international.&#13;
Reporting Requirements&#13;
The consultant will provide the implementation unit with monthly progress reports. The final&#13;
report will be delivered for two week command period The consultant then will have an&#13;
additional two weeks to incorporate the comments and deliver the final report&#13;
Procurement Process&#13;
The procurement processes will follow guidelines of the World Bank and will include a two stage&#13;
process as discussed in paragraph 2.6 of the Procurement Guideline.&#13;
2.    Priority Facilities Projects to be Addressed with Project Funding&#13;
The proposed project activities in the area of improving judicial facilities have four elements.&#13;
1. Remodeling of the Building purchased from FONAPRE by the Supreme Court for&#13;
the Consejo de la Judicatura and the Central Administrative Offices.&#13;
The judicial center in Quito is overcrowded and is a mix of Supreme Court, trial courts and&#13;
administrative offices Because of a lack of space, many courts and administrative offices are&#13;
located in rented space in private buildings around the judicial center. The Supreme Court&#13;
bought a commercial building that formerly belonged to FONAPE but has not been able to&#13;
obtain the funds to remodel the building for court use. The building will be remodeled with&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 104-&#13;
project financing to house judicial offices such as administrative offices, the new Consejo de la&#13;
Jurdicatura, or courts.&#13;
2. Remodeling of the space vacated in the judicial center to bring courts into the&#13;
building from rented office space and create a Centro de Justicia for the courts of&#13;
Quito.&#13;
In the space vacated by the functions which move to FONAPE building, courts and&#13;
administrative offices which are currently located in rented space outside of the judicial&#13;
complex can be moved into that complex creating a true judicial center. In the remodeling, an&#13;
appropriate entrance for the public, which does not exist now, can be created, individual&#13;
remodeled courts can incorporate new design techniques and in general a major improvement&#13;
in the administration of justice achieved.&#13;
3. Remodeling of the Judicial Center in Guayaquil.&#13;
The judicial center in Guayaquil is in a deteriorated state and requires remodeling in order to&#13;
reflect housing a modernized judicial branch and to function efficiently. The remodeling as in&#13;
Quito will incorporate modern concepts and courtroom layouts to the extent feasible.&#13;
4. Remodeling of buildings to create decentralized judicial centers in Quito and&#13;
Guayaquil&#13;
When the Supreme Court vacates space in the trial court building, an opportunity will be&#13;
created to incorporate the new national design standards into the remodeling of this space for&#13;
the courts that will be moved into the building. The designs should reflect some of the&#13;
obvious modifications in the current designs utilized, i.e., creating a front counter to separate&#13;
staff from the public, and minimize inappropriate contacts with litigants, as well as other&#13;
design elements that will be developed based on the analyses conducted of case administration&#13;
and the design of court facilities.&#13;

ANNEX 15: PROJECT PERFORMANCE INDICATORS&#13;
Performance indicators have been developed for the project in order to measure the&#13;
success of the reforms that will be implemented. Initial benchmarks for the indicators&#13;
were established through analysis conducted in selected jurisdictions during project&#13;
preparation in 1995 Data for the indicators will be gathered annually from those courts&#13;
participating in the reform and compared to the initial benchmarks. The necessary data&#13;
will be collected and analyzed by the statistics department and reported to the project unit&#13;
as well as to the Supreme Court There will be overall project indicators and indicators&#13;
for each project sub component. The three overall performance indicators include two&#13;
standard judicial system measures--time from filing to disposition and the volume of&#13;
dispositions and a third indicator which measures the cost to process cases to conclusion.&#13;
Time From Filing to Disposition&#13;
Changes in the time from filing to disposition of the most common case types (wrongful&#13;
termination, breach of contract and eviction) will be measured. Based on the analysis of&#13;
the case sample drawn, the data suggests that the system goals will be:&#13;
Case Type               Maximum         Current times&#13;
of disposition&#13;
Labor (wrongful termination)    11 months         8 years&#13;
Commercial (breach of contract)   6 months        5 years&#13;
Landlord Tenant (eviction)      5 months          4 years&#13;
Cases outside of the minimum and maximum standards will be looked at as if a case&#13;
exceeds the maximum time, then there is excessive delay. If the case is below the&#13;
minimum, there may be an issue of corruption which should be monitored, as the use of&#13;
public office for private use benefit is taking place. As the project advances, the&#13;
percentage of cases that fall within the maximum boundaries should increase, reflecting a&#13;
more efficient system in which all cases are addressed in their appropriate order.&#13;
The times for each individual procedural step will be monitored through the following&#13;
stages preparation/audiencia, conciliation, motions, discovery and sentencing stages.&#13;
Median times in months for each procedural steps:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Sentence            1                   3                          1.5&#13;
It is expected that these procedural times will decrease so that the overall time to&#13;
disposition will fall within the benchmarks discussed above.&#13;
VOLUME OF DISPOSITIONS&#13;
The dispositions per year of the courts participating in the project will be evaluated as a&#13;
percentage of the number of filings per year. Dispositions as a proportion of filed cases&#13;
will allow monitoring of whether judges are able to handle the volume of work or if&#13;
backlogs are developing. The statistics for the last three years show that the cases&#13;
disposed of as a proportion of filed cases is very low in the courts sampled:&#13;
1991               1992                1993&#13;
CI(I7L              42                  58                  23&#13;
LABOR               57                  66                  48&#13;
TRANSIT             30                 40                  37&#13;
It is expected that after one year of implementation the percentages should increase by 10&#13;
to 20 per cent and by similar amounts in subsequent years until dispositions either equal or&#13;
even exceed the number of filings.&#13;
Similarly, the dispositions per judge in each court will be measured to determine where the&#13;
efficiencies and inefficiencies are. The courts that are participating in the project in Quito&#13;
and Guayaquil should have higher disposition rates per judge than those courts not in the&#13;
project.&#13;
COST&#13;
The cost of providing court services will also be monitored. This cost measure will also&#13;
monitor the productivity of the courts. This will also take into account whether&#13;
administration and infrastructure reforms as well as the training provided to court&#13;
personnel and judges meet the cost effectiveness standards. This will be computed yearly&#13;
to see the progress. However, the cost prior to project implementation will need to be&#13;
computed first.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 121 -&#13;
PREDICTABILITY&#13;
As an element of predictability, the project will monitor the minimum times to disposition.&#13;
Case Type               Minimum times&#13;
to disposition&#13;
Labor (wrongful termination)    5 months&#13;
Commercial (breach of contract)    2 months&#13;

            Ecuador - Judicial Reform Project
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The overarching goal of the Judicial
            Reform Project for Ecuador is to improve the capacity of the
            judicial system by strengthening the administration of
            justice. Specifically, the project aims at: increasing
            efficiency, effectiveness and transparency in the judicial
            process by improving case administration procedures;
            improving the infrastructure; expanding the use of
            alternative dispute resolution mechanisms within the court
            system; improving the access to justice by the public and
            women in particular; and improving court reform and research
            and legal education. The four components of the project are:
            (1) case administration and information support; (2)
            court-annexed Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR)
            mechanisms comprised of court-annexed pilot mediation
            programs and ADR training; (3) program for law and justice,
            including: (a) a special fund for law and justice; (b) a
            program for modernization of property registration; (c) a
            professional development program; (d) a study on the state
            of legal education; (e) research and evaluation of pilot
            programs; and (f) legal services pilots; and (4)
            infrastructure remodeling and development.
