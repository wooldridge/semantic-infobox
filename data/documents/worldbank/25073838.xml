&amp;#12;A MESSAGE FROM NIELS HARILD&#13;
                                 I am delighted to introduce this, my last Annual Progress Report on the work&#13;
                                 of the Global Program on Forced Displacement (GPFD). When we began the&#13;
                                 program in 2009, our aim was to raise awareness within the World Bank&#13;
                                 Group (WBG) and more widely about the development impacts of conflict&#13;
                                 induced forced displacement, on the displaced, and on their host and return&#13;
                                 communities. Our vision was to shift the prevalent view at the time that&#13;
                                 displacement was primarily a humanitarian issue to be dealt with by&#13;
                                 humanitarian agencies. Our conviction was that the WBG could play a&#13;
                                 significant role in addressing forced displacement as a development challenge&#13;
                                 through its unique convening power and robust analytical, technical and&#13;
                                 operational tools and instruments.&#13;
&#13;
                                 This vision grew out of a long career with UNHCR during which it became&#13;
                                increasingly clear that the approach to dealing with refugees both in the&#13;
immediate aftermath of crisis and during the long periods they were displaced was creating a dependency that&#13;
was slowly eroding the capacity and dignity of refugees and preventing them from living meaningful lives. In&#13;
addition, there seemed to be limited attention to the impacts on their host communities or in preparing for their&#13;
return home. I saw this firsthand when I was part of the core team sending several hundred thousand&#13;
Cambodians home from camps in Thailand in 1991-1992 and realized that a holistic development approach,&#13;
emphasizing self-reliance and the wider engagement of development institutions and actors, would have made&#13;
this process more successful. After some years in the WBG, I saw an opportunity to pursue this critical agenda&#13;
from within a major development institution working closely with partners, including UNHCR.&#13;
&#13;
As I reflect on the last six years I am pleased to see the progress we have made on promoting GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
objectives. This report highlights these achievements, the obstacles in achieving them, and identifies the&#13;
opportunities and challenges ahead.&#13;
&#13;
Earlier this year UNHCR released the latest figures on forced displacement; they are sobering and a reflection&#13;
of the ongoing crises across the globe including the growing European migration crisis unfolding before our&#13;
eyes. There are now over 60 million people impacted by displacement, either as refugees, internally displaced&#13;
persons (IDPs) or as asylum seekers. Displacement has significant personal, social, economic and political&#13;
impacts, and when protracted, as in the case in many fragile and conflict affected situations, it is a threat to&#13;
economic development and the fight against poverty. However, when the displaced are offered solutions to&#13;
restore some normality to their lives and be self-reliant, often they are able to contribute to their host&#13;
communities and be better prepared to return home if the situation stabilizes. The key focus of GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s work&#13;
has been to find more effective development approaches to forced displacement in crisis situations, in&#13;
protracted situations, and when solutions are found, and to support the policies and responses of affected&#13;
governments and their partners.&#13;
&#13;
Over the last year and a half, GPFD has continued to strengthen and deepen its analytical and operational&#13;
work alongside teams from within and outside the WBG to ensure that the development dimensions of&#13;
displacement are widely understood and incorporated into programs and projects. Building on a strong body of&#13;
analysis, we have engaged on some 40 country situations, which included support to the design and&#13;
implementation of programmatic interventions that mitigate the social and economic impacts of forced&#13;
displacement. We have pioneered new and innovative approaches to analysis and operations and provided&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       1&#13;
&amp;#12;technical advice and support to WBG country teams. We have, wherever possible, seized the power of&#13;
partnership at global, national and local level to take the action needed to transform the lives of the displaced&#13;
and bring prosperity to their host and return communities.&#13;
&#13;
I am encouraged by the high level of political commitment the forced displacement agenda has recently&#13;
received, illustrated by the ground breaking joint visits of the UN Secretary General and WBG President to the&#13;
Sahel, Great Lakes and Horn regions of Africa; the excellent collaboration between the WBG and UNHCR, as&#13;
well as with our bilateral, multi-lateral and civil society partners. For example, the WBG President and UN High&#13;
Commissioner for Refugees have agreed to a more systematic strategic collaboration moving forward.&#13;
Recently, the G7 highlighted the importance of addressing the impact of forced displacement in the 2015&#13;
communiquÃ©.1 I like to think that these developments are in some small way an outcome of the commitment&#13;
and drive of GPFD over the years.&#13;
&#13;
We are making progress, as illustrated in this report. But challenges remain and addressing them is a shared&#13;
responsibility. In this crucial year for international development, with the expected agreement of the Sustainable&#13;
Development Goals (SDGs) and new approaches to financing, and the forthcoming World Humanitarian&#13;
Summit (WHS), we have an opportunity to recast how development and humanitarian agencies work on forced&#13;
displacement. We must work to strengthen the Solutions Alliance to facilitate the global, regional and national&#13;
responses. Collective advocacy and action by us all on this important development challenge is key to meeting&#13;
the SDGs. Over the next year, we plan to bring together the analytical and operational evidence and&#13;
experience to date in a major flagship report on forced displacement and development. In addition, we must&#13;
continue to mobilize significant additional financial resources to address the development challenges of forced&#13;
displacement and ensure it is included in WBG supported national development programs. The time is ripe for&#13;
further steps to complete a paradigm shift from considering forced displacement only as a humanitarian issue,&#13;
towards a more holistic approach that considers the development, security and political aspects as well.&#13;
&#13;
Based on the achievements to date, and the increased international attention to the issue, I am confident that&#13;
GPFD is well positioned moving forward to ensure an enhanced development response to forced displacement.&#13;

&amp;#12;EXECUTIVE SUMMARY&#13;
This annual progress report provides an overview of the work of the World Bank Groupâ&#128;&#153;s (WBG) Global Program on&#13;
Forced Displacement (GPFD) over the period 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2015. Conflict induced forced displacement&#13;
has emerged as one of the most critical development challenges of the 21st century. At the start of 2015 the total&#13;
number of displaced people as refugees, IDPs or asylum seekers had reached 59.5 million, the highest on record.&#13;
Many of these live in situations of protracted displacement, and the average period of displacement is now 17 years.&#13;
Forced displacement can, if not addressed, have negative impacts on poverty reduction, economic growth, peace and&#13;
stability. The ongoing crises in the Middle East and Africa, and the growing Mediterranean migration crisis, illustrate the&#13;
magnitude of the challenge. Governments facing increasing refugee and IDP numbers are looking to the international&#13;
community and the WBG to find more effective ways of addressing the development needs of the displaced and their&#13;
host and return communities.&#13;
&#13;
For the past six years GPFD has worked to: (i) increase WBG awareness of the development impact of forced&#13;
displacement, and (ii) improve the WBG contribution to an enhanced development response that supports economically&#13;
and socially sustainable solutions. GPFD is the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s main source of analysis, technical knowledge, staff capacity and&#13;
operational advice for WBG regional and country teams working on forced displacement. In collaboration with other&#13;
multilateral, bilateral and non-governmental partners GPFD also supports the development of national and international&#13;
policies and programs to address the economic and social impacts of forced displacement.&#13;
&#13;
Soon after the publication of the last progress report, a Mid-Term Review (MTR) of GPFD was completed. The MTR&#13;
highlighted the strategic relevance of GPFD both within and outside the WBG and found it to be on track towards&#13;
meeting its objectives. Given the growing international profile of the issue of conflict induced forced displacement, the&#13;
MTR recommended a significant scale-up of the program.&#13;
&#13;
During the reporting period, the WBG underwent a number of important organizational changes with the aim of aligning&#13;
human and financial resources towards to the achievement of the Twin Goals of ending extreme poverty by 2030 and&#13;
promoting shared prosperity for the 40% of the population in developing countries. To strengthen knowledge and client&#13;
responsiveness, 14 Global Practices (GPs) and 5 Cross-Cutting Solutions Areas (CCSAs) were established by the&#13;
WBG. As part of the restructuring, the MTR recommended that GPFD be located in the new CCSA on Fragility,&#13;
Conflict, and Violence (FCV), and it moved from the Social Development Department (SDV) to the FCV CCSA on 1&#13;
July, 2015.&#13;
&#13;
The past 18 months have been the most successful time so far for GPFD. Attention to the issue of forced&#13;
displacement and development is on the rise in the WBG. The recent joint visits of the UN Secretary General and the&#13;
WBG President to the Sahel, Great Lakes and Horn regions of Africa underscored the importance of addressing forced&#13;
displacement across the political, security, development, and humanitarian spectrum. The announcement of two, large-&#13;
scale WBG operations focusing on displacement in the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa demonstrates the progress that&#13;
has been made. Forced displacement is a central theme of the new WBG MENA strategy and work program. Given the&#13;
growth in displacement numbers, clients are requesting WBG technical and financial support to develop targeted&#13;
programs to assist the displaced and their hosting and return communities. This demand for GPFD operational,&#13;
analytical, partnership and knowledge services has grown over the reporting period and as a result, forced&#13;
displacement is considered a key priority for WBG senior management, the work of the FCV CCSA and for teams in&#13;
affected countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            5&#13;
&amp;#12; OPERATIONAL SUPPORT: Since its inception, GPFD has worked closely with regional and country teams to&#13;
support the development of programs during the three phases of displacement: in crises, in periods of protracted&#13;
displacement and when solutions have been found in displacement or return situations.&#13;
&#13;
During the past 18 months, the GPFD has worked with the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s Africa (AFR) Region on regional initiatives in the&#13;
Great Lakes, the Sahel, and Horn of Africa. A fourth regional initiative, centered on the Lake Chad Basin (LCB), is under&#13;
preparation. The initiatives, launched following the joint visits of the WBG President and UN Secretary General to the&#13;
regions, aim to promote peace and security and increase resilience and economic opportunity for the most vulnerable&#13;
including displaced populations. GPFD supported the operationalization of these initiatives. Through joint analytical&#13;
work with UNHCR the initiatives have been able to identify the extent, causes and character of displacement and&#13;
appropriate development responses. Pilot programs are now being developed to improve livelihoods and economic&#13;
opportunities, improve access to services and facilitate better integration of displaced and host communities. GPFD has&#13;
played a key role in the design of these projects and programs and during consultations with development partners,&#13;
regional institutions and country governments.&#13;
&#13;
In the MENA region, the Syria crisis is the largest source of refugees and IDPs. While the challenges posed by large&#13;
scale displacement flows have traditionally been regarded as humanitarian in nature, the duration and scale of the&#13;
population movements in the MENA region have revealed the long term development impacts that these crises have on&#13;
the displaced and hosts alike. GPFD has contributed to the development and implementation of a number of key&#13;
operations in response to the Syrian refugee outflows in Jordan, Lebanon, and Iraq. The design and implementation of&#13;
these operations build in part on the experience of pilot State and Peace building Fund (SPF) grants managed by&#13;
GPFD and have leveraged $50 million of grant financing in Jordan and $75 million in Lebanon. There has been less&#13;
support to IDP populations in some parts of MENA largely due to access issues. Some national programs, for example&#13;
Iraq, have been adjusted to address the vulnerability of IDPs. As part of the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s response to the Syria crisis, GPFD&#13;
is supporting the MENA regionâ&#128;&#153;s remote pilot damage assessment for the Darâ&#128;&#153;a Governorate to explore the potential of&#13;
using satellite imagery to compile damage data to facilitate future development planning.&#13;
&#13;
GPFD has also continued to provide country-specific support in the ECA, SAR and LAC regions. In Ukraine, where&#13;
there are now more than 2.3 million people affected by displacement (of which 1.4 million are IDPs), GPFD has worked&#13;
with the Country Management Unit (CMU) to develop a new operation to address internal displacement. GPFD also&#13;
contributed to the WBG-led Inter-agency Recovery and Peace-building Assessment (IRPA) by providing demographic&#13;
profiles and information on the conditions of displacement. Working with country teams GPFD has also undertaken a&#13;
number of operationally focused analytical reports, for example on the Central African Republic (CAR), which will inform&#13;
the upcoming WBG regional initiative on LCB. To ensure that a displacement lens is incorporated within the new WBG&#13;
Country Engagement Model (CEM) GPFD has contributed to the development of the Systematic Country Diagnostics&#13;
(SCD) and Country Partnership Frameworks (CPF) in affected countries, for example: Chad, Jordan, Lebanon, and&#13;
Mali; the lessons of which are being fed into WBG strategies and programs.&#13;
&#13;
ANALYTICAL WORK: Over the reporting period, GPFD has worked to further strengthen the evidence base for&#13;
development work on forced displacement to inform WBG strategic and operational decision making. The program of&#13;
analytical work has been developed in close collaboration with WBG teams, bilateral and multilateral partners, NGOs,&#13;
and research institutions. Three comprehensive and influential studies on forced displacement and development have&#13;
been completed on the Sahel, Great Lakes and the Horn of Africa. These were co-developed and co-funded by GPFD&#13;
and UNHCR and contributed significantly to the design of the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s regional initiatives. Over the past 18 months, the&#13;
WBG has expanded its efforts to quantify the impacts of forced displacement on host countries and to estimate the&#13;
welfare impacts for host communities and displaced populations through Economic and Social Impact Assessments&#13;
(ESIAs). GPFD is currently compiling a comprehensive overview of all WBG ESIAs on forced displacement, as well as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                           6&#13;
&amp;#12;major studies that have components that measure the social and/or economic impact of forced displacement in its&#13;
various forms. GPFD has provided technical inputs to a number of analyses, for example in Lebanon, Northern Mali&#13;
and Somalia, and is providing inputs and support to ongoing work in the Africa, MENA and ECA regions.&#13;
&#13;
GPFD has also worked to develop and complete analytical work on a number of key themes that will inform global&#13;
policy and operational development. This includes work on: forced displacement and the WBG's Twin Goals,&#13;
sustainable refugee return, urban displacement, land, livelihoods, and gender and displacement in the Great Lakes&#13;
Region.&#13;
&#13;
PARTNERSHIPS: Partnership is a key element of the work of GPFD and is essential for the achievement of the WBG&#13;
objectives. Following the MTR GPFD has focused significant attention on further strengthening internal and external&#13;
partnerships on the development response and solutions. Over the last year and a half, GPFD has established a strong&#13;
platform for an exchange of views and experiences and to foster co-operation with bilateral, multilateral and other&#13;
partners at global, regional and country level on the development challenges of conflict induced forced displacement.&#13;
&#13;
GPFD has maintained strong and productive working partnerships with bilateral agencies. Financial support to GPFD&#13;
provided by its key partners, including Switzerland, Denmark and Norway, has been essential in enabling GPFD to&#13;
focus on the objectives of the program and push the boundaries of forced displacement work within and outside the&#13;
WBG. GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s bilateral partnerships include: Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Canada, Sweden, the&#13;
US State Department, USAID, BMZ, Turkey and DFID. The power and value of these partnerships is evidenced in the&#13;
strategic consultations GPFD has conducted with these partners during the reporting period. Examples of this&#13;
engagement includes: (i) dialogue on forced displacement policy with DFID, the Netherlands and Switzerland; (ii)&#13;
discussions on joint research and implementation of a new forced displacement policy in Germany; (iii) implementation&#13;
of the JESSRP project in Jordan with Canada, and (iv) the design of the Solutions Alliance and strengthened&#13;
collaboration on AFR and MENA with Denmark and Norway. Finally, with Turkey, GPFD has established a new&#13;
working partnership with the Government, building on its role as a new member of the Solutions Alliance and host of the&#13;
WHS.&#13;
&#13;
Many of GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s bilateral partners were actively involved in the establishment of the Solutions Alliance in Copenhagen&#13;
in April 2014. This coalition of humanitarian actors, development organizations, affected states, donor nations,&#13;
academic and research institutions, the private sector and civil society is working to promote and enable a transition for&#13;
displaced persons from dependency towards increased resilience, self-reliance and development.&#13;
&#13;
GPFD continues to work with affected Governments. For example, GPFD invited the Ugandan Refugee Commissioner&#13;
to speak at the 2015 FCV Forum as part of a session on UNHCRâ&#128;&#153;s Alternatives to Camps policy. In Jordan, GPFD&#13;
works closely with the authorities in response to the refugee crisis, and a Government representative participated at the&#13;
latest GPFD annual meeting in Copenhagen. GPFD has continued to gather lessons from around the world to inform&#13;
WBG project and country teams, as well as external partners on the development of operations and policies.&#13;
&#13;
GPFD has intensified collaboration with UNHCR through a program of joint analytical work in the Great Lakes, Sahel,&#13;
Horn of Africa, Syria, and more recently, the Lake Chad Basin (LCB). The partnership with UNHCR is reinforced by the&#13;
recent agreement of the WBG President and UN High Commissioner to hold regular strategic consultations on the&#13;
development dimensions of forced displacement. GPFD has continued to work closely with UNDP and OCHA, both at&#13;
HQ level in Geneva and New York, as well as in the field.&#13;
&#13;
GPFD has also expanded its partnership with NGOs such as Save the Children, the International Rescue Committee&#13;
(IRC), and Search for Common Ground, to benefit from their presence on the ground, their respective thematic&#13;
expertise, and to ensure knowledge sharing. GPFD was closely involved with the establishment of the Solutions&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            7&#13;
&amp;#12;Alliance in 2014 and has since contributed to its data sharing working group and Somalia chapter. Recently, GPFD&#13;
participated in discussions with UN partners to include the issue of forced displacement in the Sustainable Development&#13;
Goals (SDGs), the WHS, and other major post-2015 conferences. Finally, GPFD has maintained strong partnerships&#13;
with research institutions, for example through its participation in the workshop organized by RefugePoint on solutions&#13;
to forced displacement, held in Boston in 2015.&#13;
&#13;
 KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT: A key recommendation of the MTR was to improve knowledge management and&#13;
communications for GPFD. The program has therefore worked to improve the quality and quantity of its knowledge&#13;
management activities so as to better share information with partners on globally relevant analytical work and&#13;
operational experience and outcomes. The team has developed a proactive knowledge management plan, which&#13;
emphasizes effective, regular dissemination of achievements.&#13;
&#13;
During the past 18 months, GPFD has organized several high profile events. This includes the â&#128;&#156;Alternatives to Campsâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
discussion during the WBG FCV Forum; an event with the Brookings Institution on the Great Lakes displacement&#13;
report; and a WBG â&#128;&#156;Solutions CafÃ©â&#128;&#157; in the margins of the WBG 2015 Spring Meetings, where key figures from senior&#13;
management discussed the importance of forced displacement for the development agenda. More recently, GPFD&#13;
organized an event on forced displacement during the retreat of the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s GSURR department.&#13;
&#13;
Responding to a call from partners at the last annual meeting of the program, GPFD has launched a new website,&#13;
www.worldbank.org/forceddisplacement, which makes it easy to retrieve analytical work and events related to the&#13;
program. In order to build a cadre of task team leaders and managers across the WBG with knowledge of the&#13;
development challenges of forced displacement, GPFD has developed a training module for the FCV Core Course and&#13;
successfully rolled out its first course on forced displacement for WBG staff for in the summer of 2015.&#13;
&#13;
MOVING FORWARD: In its six years of existence, GPFD has established a robust body of analytical, technical and&#13;
operational expertise and is now seen as the custodian of global knowledge, experience and lessons learned on forced&#13;
displacement and development in the WBG. There is growing recognition of the immense global development&#13;
challenges and opportunities associated with conflict induced forced displacement, and the issue is receiving&#13;
prominence on the international agenda. However, unless it is addressed, forced displacement will pose a real threat to&#13;
the achievement of the new SDGs and the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s Twin Goals. GPFD is well positioned to play a catalytic and&#13;
transformative role in enhancing the development response to forced displacement challenges at the policy and&#13;
operational level.&#13;
&#13;
There is strong commitment from the WBG to this agenda. GPFD will continue to build on its, analytical, technical, and&#13;
operational strengths and work closely with WBG teams and affected governments to address the development needs&#13;
of IDPs, refugees, returnees, and host communities alongside other development, humanitarian, political and security&#13;
actors. Building on the momentum over the past 18 months, GPFD plans to significantly scale up and expand its&#13;
activities, both within and outside the WBG, in order to meet the increased demands for its services.&#13;
&#13;
Following demand from the AFR and MENA regions, GPFD will lead a major WBG flagship report on the economic,&#13;
social and fiscal impacts of forced displacement and operational experiences to date. This will help to guide the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s,&#13;
Governmentsâ&#128;&#153; and partnersâ&#128;&#153; development work on forced displacement moving forward and will feed into the&#13;
discussions at the World Humanitarian Summit (WHS) in May 2016.&#13;

&amp;#12;1. INTRODUCTION&#13;
Forced displacement is one of the most critical challenges of the 21st century. The UN Refugee Agency&#13;
(UNHCR) estimates that by the end of 2014, 59.5 million individuals were forcibly displaced worldwide as a&#13;
result of persecution, conflict, generalized violence, or human rights violations. This represents the highest level&#13;
of global displacement since World War II. According to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre (IDMC),&#13;
by the end of 2014, 38 million people were forcibly displaced within their own countries as IDPs, amounting to a&#13;
15% increase compared to 2013, and the highest figures ever recorded by the organization.2 In 2014, an&#13;
average of 42,500 people became&#13;
                                              Figure 1: IDPs and refugees from 1989-2014.&#13;
refugees, asylum seekers, or IDPs&#13;
every day, and one in every 122&#13;
humans is now either a refugee,&#13;
IDP, or seeking asylum. Almost&#13;
nine out of ten refugees (86 per&#13;
cent) are in regions and countries&#13;
considered     economically  less&#13;
developed, and over half the&#13;
displaced are women and girls.&#13;
&#13;
Most displaced live in a form of&#13;
â&#128;&#156;second exileâ&#128;&#157;, caught between the&#13;
inability to return to their homes&#13;
and the lack of durable solutions&#13;
for integration. The average length&#13;
of displacement is now 17 years,&#13;
with only 126,800 refugees able to&#13;
return to their home countries in                                                                           Source: IDMC (2015)&#13;
&#13;
2014 being the lowest number in&#13;
31 years. The Syrian crisis has underlined the magnitude of the issue of protracted displacement, with&#13;
ramifications across the Mediterranean. Emerging and ongoing crises in Iraq, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan,&#13;
CAR, Ukraine, and more recently in Yemen, continue to pose significant challenges for the humanitarian,&#13;
development, political and security communities. Conflicts around the world represent a growing economic&#13;
strain, as the costs of supporting IDPs and refugees continue to rise.3&#13;
&#13;
GPFD was established in 2009 with the objectives to increase WBG awareness of the development impact of&#13;
conflict induced forced displacement and improve the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s contribution to an enhanced development&#13;
response that supports economically and socially sustainable solutions. GPFD works on three categories of&#13;
displacement: emerging crises, protracted displacement, and situations where solutions have been found for&#13;
the displaced and their host and return communities.&#13;

  According to the Institute for Economics and Peace, the global cost of conflicts is estimated to be $14.3 trillion, an the cost of&#13;
  supporting refugees and IDPs has risen 267% since 2008. Institute for Economics and Peace (2015), â&#128;&#156;Global Peace Index 2015â&#128;&#157;,&#13;

&#13;
In these contexts, the program provides analysis, technical expertise and operational advice to WBG regional&#13;
and country teams on the issue of forced displacement and works with its external partners to improve the&#13;
quality of the WBG response and share lessons learned. The purpose of this progress report is to inform&#13;
internal and external partners of the work and results of GPFD and to serve as a tool to engage development&#13;
practitioners on the issue of forced displacement.&#13;
&#13;
Forced displacement can have negative development impacts, affecting human and social capital, economic&#13;
growth, poverty reduction, the Millennium Development Goals and SDGs, and environmental sustainability. At&#13;
the same time, displacement can have some positive effects if the displaced are allowed and able to develop&#13;
skills and coping mechanisms in situ and contribute to economic growth. Both in protracted displacement and&#13;
when solutions emerge, developmental responses become critical to addressing the needs of the displaced&#13;
and their host or return communities. These needs include: (i) access to land, property and housing; (ii)&#13;
livelihoods; (iii) services delivery; and (iv) accountable and responsive governance (see figure 3).&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
To deliver the programâ&#128;&#153;s overarching objectives, GPFD pursues four core lines of activity:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                    Operational support to WBG and external partners to strengthen&#13;
              1     their responsiveness to forced displacement;&#13;
&#13;
                    Analytical work on countries, regions, or themes related to forced&#13;
              2     displacement and development;&#13;
&#13;
                    Partnerships with governments, multilateral organizations, donors,&#13;
              3     academic institutions and NGOs;&#13;
&#13;
                    Knowledge dissemination to share operational approaches and&#13;
              4     lessons learned.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
This report is structured around these four lines of activity.&#13;
&#13;
In the past 18 months, the WBG has seen a dramatic increase in client demand for development work on&#13;
forced displacement, particularly in the AFR and MENA regions. To meet this demand, GPFD is scaling up its&#13;
analytical, operational and partnership support to country and regional teams. Senior management across the&#13;
WBG is giving the issue greater priority as illustrated by the recent joint visits of the WBG President and the UN&#13;
Secretary General to the Sahel, Great Lakes, and the Horn, with announcements of operational funds directed&#13;
to forced displacement. The WBG is increasingly considered an important actor in global policy discussions on&#13;
forced displacement and in efforts to find lasting solutions.&#13;
&#13;
With its new location in the CCSA on FCV, GPFD is centrally located as the custodian of global knowledge and&#13;
lessons learned on forced displacement and development in the WBG. The following sections provide an&#13;
overview of GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s key achievements and activities for the reporting period 1 January 2014 to 30 June 2015.&#13;

2. OPERATIONAL HIGHLIGHTS&#13;
This section presents highlights of the planned, ongoing and completed operations that address the&#13;
development challenges of forced displacement in the WBG. The sub-sections are organized alphabetically&#13;
according to WBG regions, namely: Sub-Saharan Africa (AFR), East Asia and the Pacific (EAP), Europe and&#13;
Central Asia (ECA), Middle East and North Africa (MENA), South Asia (SAR), and Latin America and the&#13;
Caribbean (LAC). The AFR section will focus first on the regional initiatives in the Sahel, Great Lakes, Horn and&#13;
Lake Chad, as these have been priorities for GPFD in the past 18 months. Country descriptions are included in&#13;
each section where relevant. These operational highlights represent a sample of the work the WBG is&#13;
undertaking to address forced displacement from a development perspective. The text focuses on GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s role&#13;
where it has been active, and the work of other WBG task teams and departments.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
AFR: Sub-Saharan Africa&#13;
Regional Initiatives in Africa&#13;
During the past 18 months, AFR has launched regional initiatives in the Great Lakes, the Sahel, and the Horn of Africa.&#13;
A fourth, centered on the LCB, is under preparation. The initiatives are all premised on the assumption that greater&#13;
regional cooperation and integration, and enhanced development, will support efforts to promote peace and security in&#13;
regions affected by conflict. All of the initiatives seek to increase resilience and economic opportunity, including for the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            12&#13;
&amp;#12;most vulnerable. They provide regional investments in energy, connectivity, trade, agriculture and rural livelihoods to&#13;
boost economic prosperity. They address issues such as health, Sexual and Gender Based Violence (SGBV), womenâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
empowerment, and social cohesion to improve access to basic services and help communities rebuild following conflict.&#13;
The initiatives focus on particularly disadvantaged groups, including displaced populations and border communities.&#13;
Activities under each regional initiative are clustered into two main interrelated pillars: (i) vulnerability and resilience, and&#13;
(ii) economic cooperation and regional integration. They all have a specific focus on forced displacement, which is seen&#13;
as a priority area for attention. In addition to programmatic investments, the initiatives include substantial analytical&#13;
components, focused on identifying the drivers of conflict, facilitating conflict-sensitive program design, and determining&#13;
the extent, causes, and character of forced displacement in each of the regions.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
      QUOTE: COLIN BRUCE | DIRECTOR OF REGIONAL INTEGRATION&#13;
&#13;
      â&#128;&#156;â&#128;&#157;In Africa, we cannot achieve the Twin Goals of the WBG - eliminating absolute poverty&#13;
      and boosting shared prosperity - unless we address forced displacement. Displaced&#13;
      populations are among the poorest and most disadvantaged on the continent, and they&#13;
      demand our attention as a development institutionâ&#128;&#157;.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
The rationale for focusing on displacement is clear. Africa hosts more than a third of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s displaced&#13;
population, accounting for more than a quarter of the global total of refugees and the largest number of IDPs.&#13;
Five countries - DRC, Nigeria, Sudan, Somalia and CAR - have generated more than 80 percent of those&#13;
displaced, while sixty percent of refugees in the region are hosted by just five countries: Kenya, Chad, Ethiopia,&#13;
South Sudan and Uganda. Most of the countries generating and hosting displaced persons are International&#13;
Development Association (IDA)-countries. Given the protracted nature of most displacement in the countries&#13;
covered by the regional initiatives, a purely humanitarian response is no longer sustainable. The initiatives have&#13;
therefore adopted a longer-term development perspective and are piloting programs focused on improving&#13;
livelihoods and economic opportunity, increasing access to services, and facilitating better integration of&#13;
displaced and host-communities.&#13;
&#13;
The fact that the regional initiatives have a specific focus on forced displacement can be credited to the work of&#13;
GPFD. As the custodian of WBG expertise and knowledge on forced displacement, GPFD was called upon to&#13;
provide displacement input to the design of the initiatives. During the process of design, extensive consultations&#13;
were conducted with development partners, regional institutions, and the countries themselves. There was&#13;
unanimous agreement on the importance of addressing forced displacement, largely due to the involvement of&#13;
GFPD in the consultations, and the hands-on expertise it brought to the discussions. The program also&#13;
managed early assessments of displacement and development in close collaboration with UNHCR, which led&#13;
to the leveraging of some $250 million in operations to address displacement needs. Details of each of the&#13;
displacement programs in each of the regional initiatives are presented below.&#13;
&#13;
Sahel Region&#13;
The five core countries of the Sahel â&#128;&#147; Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Niger â&#128;&#147; face displacement issues, driven&#13;
by conflict in Mali and neighboring countries, particularly CAR, Nigeria, and Sudan. While the conflict in Northern Mali&#13;
has eased somewhat over the last year, Boko Haram activities in Northern Nigeria have emerged as a major driver of&#13;
forced displacement for Niger and Chad. Among the Sahel countries, Chad is the most seriously affected by forced&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                               13&#13;

&#13;
displacement in neighboring countries, hosting around 453,000 refugees at the end of 2014, equivalent to 34 refugees&#13;
per 100 inhabitants, the fourth highest level in the world. At the end of June 2015, there were around 137,000 Malian&#13;
refugees, mostly in Mauritania and Niger, and around 90,000 IDPs within Mali.&#13;
&#13;
The WBG Africa region included forced displacement as one of the main challenges to be addressed in the regional&#13;
Sahel Initiative document. GPFD was requested to provide strategic and technical input to the formulation of the&#13;
displacement aspects of the initiative. A scoping study on â&#128;&#152;Forced Displacement of and Potential Solutions for IDPs and&#13;
refugees in the Sahelâ&#128;&#153; was undertaken jointly by GPFD and UNHCR in 2013, and contributed to the formulation of a&#13;
regional policy framework for sustainable solutions to displacement and towards the operationalization of a&#13;
development response. Following discussions with ECOWAS and the WBG on security and development in October of&#13;
2013, the WBG was requested to provide language on displacement in the ECOWAS regional strategy for security and&#13;
development in the Sahel. Building on this work, more recent activities have included a face-to-face baseline survey&#13;
with displaced Malians as well as monthly follow-up interviews with baseline respondents using mobile phones. This&#13;
work has been led by the WBG Macro-Fiscal Global Practice, with technical advice and co-funding from GPFD.&#13;
&#13;
In terms of strategic and operational involvement, GPFD has provided input into the Chad and Mali Systematic Country&#13;
Diagnostic (SCD) and Country Partnership Framework (CPF) exercises to ensure appropriate WBG inclusion of&#13;
displacement issues into these documents. GPFD has also provided review comments and otherwise engaged with the&#13;
Task Team Leaders (TTLs) of relevant projects to promote the integration of displacement considerations into projects&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;in the region, particularly in the targeting of development support. This has included the â&#128;&#156;Mali Reconstruction and&#13;
Economic Recovery Projectâ&#128;&#157; and the regional pastoralist project.&#13;
&#13;
Going forward, two of the core Sahel countries, Chad and Niger, will be included in a sub-regional assessment of the&#13;
social and economic impacts of forced displacement in the LCB, building on initial scoping work supported by GPFD in&#13;
FY15 (see Lake Chad section below). The work will be undertaken jointly with UNHCR and will have a particular focus&#13;
on Boko Haram. Country studies are planned for both countries, as well as for Nigeria and Cameroon.&#13;
&#13;
Mauritania&#13;
GPFD has been collaborating with the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s Global Practice on Social, Urban, Rural &amp; Resilience (GSURR)&#13;
over the last few years to prepare the "Islamic Republic of Mauritania: Sustainable Livelihoods for Returnees&#13;
and Host Communities in the River Valley Projectâ&#128;&#157;. This project was approved in February 2014 and is financed&#13;
by a Japanese Social Development Fund (JSDF) of $2.85 million.&#13;
&#13;
The development objective of this project is to improve access to livelihood support for returnees and&#13;
host communities and to enhance conflict prevention and risk management mechanisms in Brakna and&#13;
Trarza in the Senegal River Valley area. The specific objectives are to: (i) contribute to reducing food&#13;
insecurity through support in the provision of production inputs for 3,830 households, with emphasis on&#13;
women and youth, (ii) enhance capacity for women and youth for 1,500 households, (iii) establish and&#13;
strengthen community-based organizations to work with communities to identify, develop, implement&#13;
and evaluate their own community development plans; and (iv) promote social cohesion efforts by&#13;
strengthening 22 community structures on issues as local conflict prevention, risk management and&#13;
participatory monitoring and evaluation.&#13;

Great Lakes Region&#13;
In 2013, the WBG launched the Great Lakes Regional Initiative (GLRI) â&#128;&#156;Reviving the Great Lakesâ&#128;&#157;,4 designed to work in&#13;
support of achievement of the Peace Security and Cooperation Framework (PSCF) for the Democratic Republic of&#13;
Congo (DRC) and the region. GPFD undertook early and upfront engagement with the GLRI, to ensure that it gave&#13;
particular consideration of the regional implications and poverty impacts of the 3.3 million people who remained forcibly&#13;
displaced within the Great Lakes region (GLR). $100 million was allocated under the GLRI for a project to address the&#13;
vulnerabilities of the displaced and their host communities. This â&#128;&#156;Great Lakes Region Displaced People and Border&#13;
Communities Projectâ&#128;&#157; intends to improve the integration and socio-economic development prospects of those affected&#13;
by forced displacement, including the local communities which host the displaced.&#13;
&#13;
As a first step in defining a response to forced displacement under the GLRI, GPFD funded a joint UNHCR-WBG study,&#13;
highlighting the development dimensions of forced displacement in the region. GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s support went to hiring a team of&#13;
consultants who completed field work for the study under the oversight of WBG staff. The report, titled â&#128;&#156;Forced&#13;
Displacement in the Great Lakes Region: A Development Approachâ&#128;&#157;,5 analyses the extent, causes, and character of&#13;
forced displacement in the GLR, and also presents opportunities to foster and utilize refugeesâ&#128;&#153; economic potential. The&#13;

&amp;#12;report advocates for a regional response to forced displacement. It also suggests bringing in a wider set of development&#13;
actors alongside humanitarian actors to tackle development challenges such as: access to land, inclusion of the&#13;
displaced in mainstream service delivery and in wider development strategies, building on the economic contribution of&#13;
the displaced and addressing their unique vulnerabilities.&#13;
&#13;
The report was disseminated at three events, all funded by GPFD â&#128;&#147; one joint panel at The Brookings Institution in&#13;
Washington, DC, and two others in Kinshasa and Goma, DRC. The project team for the â&#128;&#156;Great Lakes Region&#13;
Displaced People and Border Communities Projectâ&#128;&#157; have used the process of undertaking the report and&#13;
disseminating the findings to engage a wider set of development actors and donors to define responses to forced&#13;
displacement in the region. The partnership between UNHCR and the WBG in undertaking the report has been&#13;
particularly instrumental in securing greater in-country communication between the two actors, with stronger definition of&#13;
comparative roles, complementarities and unique organizational strength to address forced displacement.&#13;
&#13;
The task team for the project has also directly acted on the recommendations of the report in the initial design phases of&#13;
the $100 million â&#128;&#156;Great Lakes Region Displaced People and Border Communities Projectâ&#128;&#157;. Four distinct, but closely&#13;
linked, pieces of work are now underway to implement this project in DRC, Zambia and Tanzania and at a regional&#13;
level. These openings for implementation of the project have been created through a number of actions including:&#13;
raising awareness with client governments of the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s willingness to finance and define development responses to&#13;
forced displacement, particularly protracted displacement, with particular emphasis on the potential economic and social&#13;
benefits for hosting regions and nations; raising awareness with WBG country management of the commitment and&#13;
technical capacity within the WBG to respond to forced displacement; and working with UNHCR to identify areas of&#13;
complementarity in bringing solutions to protracted displacement.&#13;
&#13;
Based on confirmed Government demand, the â&#128;&#156;Great Lakes Region Displaced People and Border Communities&#13;
Projectâ&#128;&#157; is now moving ahead in DRC, Zambia and Tanzania. The project will focus on: (i) livelihoods and sustainable&#13;
access to socio-economic services for IDPs, returnees and refugees in the DRC; and (ii) achieving the local integration&#13;
of the former Burundian refugees in Tanzania and former Angolan refugees in Zambia and improving the development&#13;
prospects in the settlements where they have continued to live for more than forty years. In addition, the project will&#13;
support a regional process for reaching solutions on forced displacement, being initiated and led by the Office of the&#13;
Special Representative of the Great Lakes.&#13;

targeted provinces. The proposed additional financing will: (i) assist displaced and host communities to rebuild&#13;
socio-economic infrastructure destroyed by conflict; (ii) support communities of IDPs who decide to remain in&#13;
their area of displacement and their hosts by expanding socio-economic infrastructure that has become&#13;
overburdened; (iii) strengthen the community level conflict prevention and management training to improve the&#13;
likelihood of peaceful reintegration of returning community members and minimize tensions between the&#13;
displaced and their host communities; and (iv) provide short-term and longer-term livelihoods opportunities to&#13;
returnees, to those wishing to settle in their areas of displacement, and to those who have hosted them.&#13;
&#13;
Both local authorities and development partners have been unanimous in indicating accessibility as a crucial&#13;
and urgent ingredient for both stabilization and development. Therefore, road rehabilitation will be a main&#13;
activity intended to create short-term employment opportunities. The project has selected strategic corridors&#13;
where road rehabilitation will serve to improve rural householdsâ&#128;&#153; access to social services and markets. The&#13;
selected corridors coincide with the areas in the East with the heaviest concentration of displaced people, most&#13;
of whom have settled only 15 â&#128;&#147; 20 km from their village of origin, often along a main road, where they feel more&#13;

strategic corridors combining a high density of population at risk and a high agricultural potential.&#13;
&#13;
Tanzania&#13;
In Tanzania, the Government has requested participation in the regional project in order to fund the sustainable&#13;
integration of 200,000 long-term refugees from Burundi, who have recently been awarded Tanzanian citizenship. The&#13;
former refugees or New Tanzanians (NT) have mostly been living in three settlements in the western regions of&#13;
Tanzania, where they have remained for forty years. Together with the Ministry of Home Affairs and UNHCR, the WBG&#13;
task team is contributing to the development of a government-led â&#128;&#152;Strategic Plan for Local Integrationâ&#128;&#153; (SPLI), which will&#13;
outline all the activities to be undertaken in support of the NT settlements and their wider hosting districts. Using funds&#13;
from GPFD and UNHCR, the task team is currently supervising three pieces of analytic work in support of the&#13;
finalization of the SPLI. These are: (i) an assessment of the possibility to increase secure access to land for NT, (ii) a&#13;
technically and spatially sound plan of socio-economic needs in the settlements and surrounding districts, (iii) an&#13;
assessment of improving livelihood status in the new settlements.&#13;
&#13;
Although still in the early stages of project design, it is envisaged that in Tanzania, the â&#128;&#156;Great Lakes Region,&#13;
Displaced People and Border Communities Projectâ&#128;&#157; will work in support of the SPLI. In particular, the project&#13;
will direct funds to local government authorities to undertake investments, which will support integration and&#13;
extend local government administration to the settlements. The settlements have been largely administered&#13;
through a humanitarian approach with parallel UN funding, and the project will underpin a transition to inclusion&#13;
in more mainstream government-led development processes. At the central level, the project will support a&#13;
transition of authority of the settlements from the Ministry of Home Affairs to other responsible line Ministries.&#13;
&#13;
Zambia&#13;
In Zambia, the Government has requested participation in the regional project in order to continue to support&#13;
the continued local integration of those refugees from Angola, who have been given residency rights in Zambia&#13;
after a protracted displacement of more than forty years. These former refugees are in the process of relocating&#13;
from the settlements, where they have lived for four decades, to two newly designated â&#128;&#156;Resettlement Areasâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
where they will receive full land rights. A â&#128;&#156;Strategic Framework for Local Integration (SFLI)â&#128;&#157; was designed to&#13;
support this resettlement process but has suffered from some weaknesses, including the use of a short term&#13;
humanitarian approach to design and fulfill the socio-economic needs in the resettlement areas. A recent&#13;
spatial and technical planning consultancy, funded by GPFD, has identified a number of planning flaws in the&#13;
current design of the resettlement areas, which is undermining the relocation process. In addition, this&#13;
consultancy suggests how to situate the socio-economic needs of the resettlement areas more strongly within&#13;
development planning processes for the wider districts and regions, a perspective which was lacking in the&#13;
SFLI. This analysis will lay the ground work for the project to identify development investments that extend&#13;
benefits to the wider districts and provinces, which has been explicitly requested by the Government in Zambia.&#13;
&#13;
Regional Engagement&#13;
Lastly, to help ensure collaborative regional engagement, the project task team is working with The Special Envoy of&#13;
the Secretary-General to the Great Lakes Region on regional responses for durable solutions. In this process, the&#13;
Special Envoy of the Secretary-General to the Great Lakes Region seeks to work with political, humanitarian and&#13;
development partners (AU, International Conference on the Great Lakes Region (ICGLR), IOM, OCHA, UNHCR and&#13;
the WBG) to help Governments in the region develop a shared vision and common actions to better address forced&#13;
displacement. In order to achieve this objective, a joint action plan will be developed along three lines: (i) awareness&#13;
raising and sensitization on the reality of displacement in the GLR; the impact on security; development for displaced&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            19&#13;
&amp;#12;populations; and host communities and host countries; (ii) a policy formulation plan, based on a technical expert group,&#13;
leading up to a high-level meeting, and (iii) a research program to further develop evidence supporting the development&#13;
of a long-term policy response to displacement. This is intended to lay the ground for a major donor conference for&#13;
durable solutions in the region. In support of this process, GPFD is funding a consultant based in Nairobi to coordinate&#13;
key agencies. The consultant is collaborating directly with the Special Envoy to give practical support to this new&#13;
initiative and to link it with the work of the project task team.&#13;
&#13;
Horn of Africa Region&#13;
The Horn of Africa (HOA) covers Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan, and&#13;
Uganda. Despite its rich endowment in human, social, and natural capital, the region is plagued by a complex&#13;
history of insecurity, weak governance, increasing environmental degradation, entrenched poverty, and a range&#13;
of persistent development challenges including conflict induced forced displacement. With technical and&#13;
advisory support from GPFD, the WBG launched the â&#128;&#156;Regional Initiative in Support of the Horn of Africa in&#13;
October 2014â&#128;&#157;. The initiative highlighted protracted forced displacement as one of the most complex and&#13;
pressing regional development challenges and identified the need to â&#128;&#156;address the economic and social impact&#13;
of protracted displacement on affected host populations, and enhance the productive capacities and coping&#13;
mechanisms of displaced populations to allow them to contribute to the local economy in their areas of&#13;
displacement, and promote durable social and economic reintegration for voluntary returneesâ&#128;&#157;.&#13;
&#13;
The initiative brought together WBG and UNHCR country teams, respective government counterparts, and&#13;
other multilateral and bilateral partners to identify the most appropriate policy and development interventions to&#13;
address forced displacement, mitigate the impact on refugee hosting communities, promote peace and&#13;
security, reduce poverty for both refugees and hosts, and achieve sustainable development in the Horn. The&#13;
approach adopted by the WBG/GPFD in the Horn of Africa represents a new more collaborative way of working&#13;
on forced displacement and has established the foundations for a mechanism for regional and national policy&#13;
and operational dialogue. Dialogue has been initiated with the Horn country governments on the importance of&#13;
both a country level and a regional response, with the latter facilitated through the regional institutions such as&#13;
EAC and/or IGAD to address displacement as a development issue. The ongoing analytical and program&#13;
development work supported by GPFD, GSURR and country offices to understand the dynamics of&#13;
displacement and explore possible solutions across the region, will yield important lessons for the region but&#13;
also for addressing other crises or protracted displacement situations.&#13;
&#13;
Forced Displacement and Mixed Migration in the Horn of Africa Study&#13;
As a central part of the Horn Regional Initiative, GPFD, in collaboration with UNHCR, co-funded a joint&#13;
WBG-UNHCR study on â&#128;&#156;Forced Displacement and Mixed Migration in the Horn of Africaâ&#128;&#157; 6 which aimed&#13;
to: (i) analyze the forced displacement and development nexus, (ii) explore the mixed migration&#13;
phenomenon, (iii) assess the impacts of refugees and migrants on hosting areas and communities, (iv)&#13;
identify ongoing innovative interventions, and (v) propose entry points and practical steps to address&#13;
the development dimensions of forced displacement and mixed migration in the HOA. The study, which&#13;
was initially designed, led and managed by GPFD, drew from a rich body of literature, in-depth&#13;
interviews, and focal group meetings with displaced persons (refugees, returnees, IDPs), host&#13;
communities, government agencies, UN and bilateral partners, and NGOs. Gradually management has&#13;
been transferred to GSURR and country offices in an effort to mainstream the displacement work into&#13;

&amp;#12;the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s operations. This is the first time that the development and strategic implications of&#13;
displacement and a coordinated response in the HOA has been discussed with governments and other&#13;
multilateral and bilateral partners. The findings of the study and the HOA Initiative has facilitated a&#13;
comprehensive dialogue on the development of solutions that will address the humanitarian and&#13;
development needs of the displaced, migrants and the hosting communities.&#13;
&#13;
The study illustrates how every country in the HOA has, in some way been affected by forced displacement&#13;
and mixed migration and that most of the displacement situations have lasted for more than 20 years. While&#13;
endemic armed conflict remains a major cause of displacement, it is rarely an isolated cause of displacement.&#13;
In most cases, a complex set of circumstances drives displacement, including poor governance, environmental&#13;
degradation and food insecurity, and lack of economic opportunities. The protracted nature of forced&#13;
displacement in the HOA has had both negative and positive effects on refugee and hosting communities alike.&#13;
Major refugee camps are in relatively poor, underdeveloped, and economically marginalized borderlands and in&#13;
relatively remote areas in host countries. Displaced and migrant populations in general, but women in&#13;
particular, confront a range of severe protection challenges emerging from a constellation of poverty,&#13;
uncertainty, insecurity, conflict, sexual and gender based violence and flight.&#13;
&#13;
The study identified a number of recommendations for further policy and operational dialogue across&#13;
the region. This included: (i) enhancing social cohesion between displaced and host communities and&#13;

&amp;#12;increasing their self-reliance by building on their human, social, and financial skills and capital; (ii) improving the quality&#13;
of social and economic ties between displaced and host communities; (iii) strengthening the resilience of host&#13;
communities, while preparing the displaced for durable solutions; and (iv) equipping refugees to secure livelihoods,&#13;
resources, and assets so as to have a better chance of returning and also contributing to host economies. Countries in&#13;
the region have certain displacement-specific laws and human rights instruments at the disposal, and it was therefore&#13;
recommended that development solutions be tailored with these in mind.&#13;
&#13;
Regional Operation on the Development Response to Displacement in the Horn of Africa&#13;
GPFD is currently working closely with the AFR and GSURR to design a regional operation to support Djibouti, Ethiopia&#13;
and Uganda to address the impacts of refugee presence on the host communities. The project aims to improve access&#13;
to social services, expand economic opportunities and enhance environmental management for host and forcibly&#13;
displaced households in the targeted areas of Djibouti, Ethiopia and Uganda. The operational approach will be&#13;
Community Driven Development (CDD) oriented and will involve: (i) building grassroots institutions, (ii) ensuring voice of&#13;
all communities including refugees in decision making, (iii) strengthening decentralized government administrative&#13;
functions, as well as (iv) investing in public service delivery and social mobilization to enhance the social cohesion&#13;
among the beneficiary communities.&#13;
&#13;
Regional HOA Operation: Djibouti&#13;
Djibouti hosts over 20,000 refugees, mainly Somalis, in the Ali Addeh and Hol Hol refugee camps. The surrounding&#13;
host population faces greater food insecurity and has limited access to basic social services and livelihood&#13;
opportunities. In addition, Djibouti has been the main transit route for migrants from HOA countries traveling to the&#13;
Middle East and Europe seeking better economic opportunities, with departure points around the Obock town in&#13;
Djibouti. The recent crisis in Yemen between Houthis and the Yemeni Government, has caused the influx of Djiboutian&#13;
and foreign nationals into Obock town, increasing pressure on local services and consequently on residents. The&#13;
proposed project would directly contribute to addressing the impacts of refugees on host areas around the refugee&#13;
camps of Ali Addeh and Hol Hol; in the city of Obock, and potentially Balballa area around Djibouti Ville. The project&#13;
would address vulnerabilities such as poverty and unemployment, deficits in human development and social service&#13;
delivery, environmental degradation, and limited access to basic infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
Regional HOA Operation: Ethiopia&#13;
Ethiopia is the largest refugee hosting country in Africa. At the end of 2013, there were 433,936 refugees in Ethiopia as&#13;
a result of droughts, conflicts, political events and civil wars in neighboring countries, including Somalia, Eritrea, South&#13;
Sudan, and Sudan. The majority of refugees in Ethiopia are hosted in the four regions of Ethiopia, which are: (i) the Afar&#13;
Regional State; (ii) the Benishangul-Gumuz Regional State; (iii) the Gambela Regional State; and (iv) the Somali&#13;
Regional State. These regions are defined by the Government of Ethiopia as â&#128;&#156;Emerging Regionsâ&#128;&#157; and are the least&#13;
developed regions in the country, characterized by challenging weather conditions, poor infrastructure, extremely low&#13;
capacity, high level of poverty, and very poor development indicators. The proposed regional displacement project will&#13;
contribute directly to the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s Growth and Transformation Plan II objectives of expanding access to and&#13;
ensuring quality of social services, and thereby achieving MDGs in the social sector; support provision of basic social&#13;
services; and strengthen the economic opportunities and livelihoods of refugee hosting communities for the&#13;
underserved communities in the Emerging Regions (Gambela, Somali and Benishangul-Gumuz).&#13;
&#13;
Regional HOA Operation: Uganda&#13;
Uganda is the third largest refugee-hosting country in Africa. As a result of ongoing conflicts and instability in the DRC,&#13;
Somalia and South Sudan; Uganda is currently hosting over 433,000 refugees and asylum-seekers. About 190,000 are&#13;
Congolese refugees mainly hosted in South-West and Mid-West Uganda, and close to 167,000 are South Sudanese&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                              22&#13;
&amp;#12;mainly hosted in Adjumani, Arua and Kiryandongo districts. The proposed regional project will support sustainable&#13;
livelihoods, environmental protection, and community infrastructure under the Settlement Transformative Agenda (STA)&#13;
refugee-hosting districts in North, Mid-West and South West of Uganda. This will help achieve self-reliance and local&#13;
settlement for refugees and to promote social development in the refugee hosting areas.&#13;
&#13;
An Assessment of Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s Approach to Refugees&#13;
As part of the regional study described above, GPFD has provided funding to a study assessing Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
approach to refugees. The Government of Uganda has been taking a number of steps to strengthen the self-&#13;
reliance and resilience of refugees and host communities. The draft National Development Plan II (NDP II,&#13;
2015/16-2019/20) has refugee-specific strategy known as the Settlement Transformative Agenda (STA), an&#13;
initiative led by the Office of the Prime Minister (OPM) with the aim of achieving self-reliance and local&#13;
settlement for refugees, and to promote social development in the refugee hosting areas. The Government of&#13;
Uganda (GOU) has requested the United Nations Country Team (UNCT) and the WBG to support the&#13;
Settlement Transformative Agenda (STA). In response to the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s request, the UN and WBG are in&#13;
the process of developing the Refugee and Host Population Empowerment (ReHoPE), a self-reliance and&#13;
resilience program for refugee and host communities in Uganda. GPFD is providing technical support to the&#13;
WBG Uganda country team and GSURR with the development and implementation of ReHoPE. This study will&#13;
assess and analyze the evolving refugee policy and practice in Uganda in order to: (i) better understand how&#13;
well the policy framework has contributed to the refugeeâ&#128;&#153;s well-being and self-reliance; and (ii) identify lessons&#13;
from Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s experience.&#13;

&#13;
The Peculiar (?) Dynamics of the Kakuma Refugee Camp&#13;
Another study which came about following the regional study on forced displacement and mixed migration in the HOA is&#13;
the study on Kakuma Refugee Camp. Kakuma, which is located in the Turkana County (Northwestern Kenya), has&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         23&#13;
&amp;#12;been hosting refugees since 1991. The humanitarian assistance and care and maintenance programs in Kakuma were&#13;
devised to address the immediate needs of the refugees. The refugee assistance program, as currently managed, is&#13;
not financially sustainable, since it is based on the assumption that refugees would receive full assistance for their basic&#13;
needs until such time as they cease to be refugees. In order to transform the refugee program into one that would&#13;
address the developmental needs of the refugee and host communities, UNHCR has launched the â&#128;&#156;Turkana Initiative&#13;
on the Integration of the Refugee and Host Community Economiesâ&#128;&#157;, in partnership with the County Government and&#13;
development partners. The overall objective of this initiative is to re-orient the refugee assistance program to contribute&#13;
to: (i) improve the socio-economic conditions of the refugee and the host communities; (ii) better prepare the host&#13;
community to take advantage of emerging economic opportunities in upcoming extraction and potential irrigation fed&#13;
agriculture; and (iii) reduce over-dependence on humanitarian aid and prepare the refugees for durable solutions.&#13;
&#13;
As part of the Initiative, UNHCR organized the Turkana Roundtable on the Integration of Refugees and Host&#13;
Community Economies on 27-28 November 2014 in Lodwar, Turkana County. The Roundtable, which was co-&#13;
facilitated by GPFD, was opened by the Governor of Turkana County, H.E. Josphat Nanok and was attended by Hon&#13;
Daniel Nanok (Member of Parliament for Turkana West) as well as representatives of the national and county&#13;
governments, UN agencies, bilateral aid agencies, civil society, refugees, and host communities. The Roundtable&#13;
participants noted that the protracted humanitarian aid delivery model is not suited to the strong socio-economic&#13;
interaction between the refugee and host communities. There was a clear consensus on the need for a different&#13;
approach to refugee assistance. One of the key action items of the Roundtable is the joint UNHCR-WBG ESIA on â&#128;&#156;The&#13;
Peculiar (?) Dynamics of the Kakuma Refugee Camp: An Economic and Social Impact Analysisâ&#128;&#157;. GPFD, alongside&#13;
UNHCR, is providing substantial financial and technical inputs to the study.&#13;
&#13;
The objective of the proposed ESIA is to assess the macro, micro, and social impact of the presence of refugees on the&#13;
host communities in the Turkana County in Kenya. While there have been a variety of descriptive studies about the&#13;
interactions between refugees, the aid community, and hosts in the vicinity of Kakuma camp, these have not yet been&#13;
able to provide estimates of the net benefits to locals of the presence of refugees and aid. When completed, the results&#13;
of this work will: (i) inform policy discussions on integrating the refugee and host community economies by clarifying the&#13;
concepts and (ii) inform the WBG development response to displacement induced macro-fiscal, environmental and&#13;
social impacts through existing or stand-alone operations.&#13;
&#13;
Eastern Sudan&#13;
Eastern Sudan has a total population of approximately 4.5 million. The 2006 signing of the Peace Agreement between the&#13;
Government of Sudan and the Eastern Sudan Front was a landmark step towards paving a way for economic and social&#13;
development in Eastern Sudan. The region remains fragile however, subject to multiple sources of stress. As a â&#128;&#156;host&#13;
communityâ&#128;&#157; to refugees and IDPs, most of the population of Eastern Sudan suffers from acute poverty and limited&#13;
development prospects, not dissimilar from those experienced by the IDP and refugee population in their midst. Having had&#13;
refugees and IDPs in Sudan for many years, forced displacement represents a significant conflict stress factor for the Sudan.&#13;
&#13;
GPFD has been key in designing the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s current development response on displacement issues. GPFD supported&#13;
the establishment of the Transitional Solutions Initiative (TSI) for Eastern Sudan, a joint partnership between the UNDP,&#13;
UNHCR, and the WBG with the objective of developing a coordinated and comprehensive response to displacement in&#13;
the region. TSI has developed two pilot projects to begin addressing the displacement needs in post-conflict Eastern&#13;
Sudan. One of them is the UNDP-UNHCRâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;Transitional Solutions Initiative for Refugees and their Host Communities,&#13;
Eastern Sudan â&#128;&#147; Phase 1â&#128;&#157; and another is the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s â&#128;&#156;Sustainable Livelihoods for Displaced and Vulnerable&#13;
Communities in Eastern Sudan Projectâ&#128;&#157; (SLDP). With technical oversight from GPFD, the WBG was able to secure&#13;
$3.08 million for the initial phase of SLDP through the SPF.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                             24&#13;
&amp;#12;SLDP targets IDPs and their host communities in Kassala state with the objective of strengthening the capacity of local&#13;
stakeholders, including state authorities, displaced persons and vulnerable host communities to plan and deliver&#13;
services and develop sustainable livelihoods. The project pilots an approach whereby local community groups plan,&#13;
prioritize and decide on local development activities and manage the implementation of projects. Local community&#13;
groups select business initiatives and small-scale community works, proposed by community members, to receive&#13;
grants, training, and advisory support from the project and key stakeholders. The benefit received from the project is&#13;
thereafter trans-passed to other beneficiaries in the community via agreed upon internal systems. The approach is&#13;
executed through extensive facilitated community consultations and is intended to empower IDPs and host&#13;
communities to become drivers of their own development, rather than recipients of aid.&#13;
&#13;
As of project midterm (March 2015), 7 in depth studies had been conducted to technically backstop project intervention,&#13;
including value chain analyses of prominent livelihood opportunities (agriculture, mechanics, metal carpentry, poultry, and&#13;
livestock); examination of community social dynamics (gender, decision-making, and conflict); study of credit instruments;&#13;
and capacity assessments of local stakeholders. Knowledge generated from these studies has served to inform&#13;
community mobilization and implementation. Approximately 33% of the intended beneficiaries had received livelihoods&#13;
grants and associated packaged services from the project at the midterm. Preliminary findings indicate that the pilot has&#13;
increased income and economic wellbeing of target beneficiaries, while data on planning capacities needs to be collected.&#13;
Should the results materialize as planned, the intended impact is to positively contribute to increased resilience and&#13;
reduced vulnerability to the stresses of displacement. The model being developed by SLDP, following the results of formal&#13;
evaluations, is marked for consideration in other regions in Sudan acutely affected by forced displacement.&#13;
&#13;
South Sudan&#13;
South Sudan became independent on July 9, 2011 after a six-year transitional period that ended decades of war&#13;
between the Government of Sudan and the Sudan Peopleâ&#128;&#153;s Liberation Movement (SPLM). Four years after&#13;
independence, South Sudan remains one of the worldâ&#128;&#153;s most conflict-affected and fragile countries, and has not been&#13;
able to emerge from cycles of violence. The outbreak of conflict in December 2013 within its borders, which morphed&#13;
into an inter-ethnic conflict, suggests that South Sudan is trapped in a cycle of violence. Although oil production places&#13;
South Sudan in the lower middle-income group, it has some of the lowest social and infrastructure access indicators in&#13;
the world. In South Sudan, two projects have a particular focus on forced displacement, namely the Local Government&#13;
Service Delivery Program (LGSDP), and the Safety Nets and Skills Development Project (SNSDP).&#13;
&#13;
South Sudan â&#128;&#147; Local Government Service Delivery Program&#13;
LGSDP aims to support improvements in local governance and service delivery by simultaneously strengthening&#13;
community engagement and local government capacities in the planning, implementation and oversight of local&#13;
development activities. The design of project activities was informed by upfront analytical work to ensure that the&#13;
displaced and returnees are included in community mobilization and consultation mechanisms and in the prioritization&#13;
of project investments in service delivery and small scale infrastructure. The project ensures the representation of&#13;
displaced populations, including returnees in particular, in the constitution of local government bodies has been ensured&#13;
through guidelines issued by the Local Government Board, providing for representation of the displaced through defined&#13;
committee quotas. The displaced people and returnees also actively contribute to setting priorities, in terms of which&#13;
local infrastructure that is to be rehabilitated. The process for social and resource mapping focuses specifically on local&#13;
conflict drivers and mitigation, and measures to enhance cohesion between the displaced and host communities.&#13;
&#13;
Project implementation commenced in the latter part of 2013 with a First Track Initiative (FTI) in Lakes and Western&#13;
Equatoria, Upper Nile and Jonglei states. In Lakes and Western Equatoria, the Project has been active in 4 counties&#13;
and 12 payams; but implementation deferred in Jonglei and Upper Nile following December 2013 crisis. To date, four&#13;
Counties in Lakes and Western Equatoria States have received the development grants in two installments and have&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                            25&#13;
&amp;#12;been implementing PDG-funded projects. So far, completed projects include: 11 boreholes, 10 classrooms and 2 out-&#13;
patient blocks, 11 boreholes and a 43.5km stretch of manual road clearing. In addition, six more counties in Lakes,&#13;
Western Equatoria, Warrap and Eastern Equatoria States are being prepared to receive the Grants in FY2015/16.&#13;
Three more States during FY2015/16 will be added, bringing a total of seven out of the ten states under the project. An&#13;
informal process audit has confirmed that the representation of displaced populations, including returnees in community&#13;
mobilization and institutions. The LGSDP has introduced community level reconciliation and conflict management&#13;
following the December 2013 conflict.&#13;
&#13;
South Sudan - Safety Nets and Skills Development Project&#13;
The second project, SNSDP, aims to provide access to income opportunities and temporary employment to the poor&#13;
and vulnerable and put in place building blocks for a social protection system in South Sudan. It is intended to&#13;
particularly target youth and women (including those in protracted displacement or have not been fully integrated) in&#13;
poor households.7 Skills gaps and Market Needs Assessments have been completed in two urban areas and the Skills&#13;
training pilot has been planned. Roll-out has been deferred, however, due to the conflict situation in the country and the&#13;
limited opportunities in the market for skills based employment. Nevertheless, given the increased number of destitute&#13;
people, owing to the December 2013 crisis which has not yet been addressed, the work on public works to provide both&#13;
opportunities for cash transfers and to build some basic infrastructure is being planned with specific efforts at&#13;
disaggregating and effectively targeting refugee returnees, IDPs and locals.&#13;
&#13;
South Sudan: Enhancing Understanding and Informing Programming through Support for Return and&#13;
Reintegration of IDPs and Refugees&#13;
This technical assistance has the objective of supporting the Government of South Sudan through diagnostics, design&#13;
and implementation support for relevant strategies and policies so that the development needs of the displaced are&#13;
addressed under the IDA funded LGSDP and thus contribute to sustainable solutions for returnees, IDPs and their host&#13;
and return communities. Specifically this is expected to support:&#13;
&#13;
        (i)       Displacement Diagnostics: LGSDPâ&#128;&#153;s design was informed by a GPFD commissioned study on the&#13;
                  displacement-development nexus, in order to have a more granular understanding on returning refugees,&#13;
                  IDPs and refugees in South Sudan, including flows and dynamics of new and old internal displacement.&#13;
                  This updated the information base for LGSDPâ&#128;&#153;s field implementation one the hand and also the WBG's&#13;
                  emerging portfolio and programming by other stakeholders, including donors, NGOs and the&#13;
                  Government.&#13;
        (ii)      Implementation effectiveness: Support systematic evaluation at Mid-Term and End-Term the efficacy of&#13;
                  displacement sensitive approaches adopted and implemented by LGSDP, to inform necessary&#13;
                  modifications for the current project, as well as other current and pipeline operations in the Banks portfolio,&#13;
                  as well as programming by other stakeholders.&#13;
        (iii)     Implementation design modifications: Based on the periodic updates on displacement dynamics and the&#13;
                  systematic evaluation of implementation effectiveness, LGSDP will make necessary modifications in its&#13;
                  approaches at community mobilization, infrastructure creation and service delivery with respect to meeting&#13;
                  the needs of the displaced as well.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
7&#13;
     This will enable them to have (i) short term monetary transfers linked to participation in public works, and (ii) access to livelihood&#13;
    opportunities through comprehensive skills development training comprised of technical, entrepreneurship and life skills. An&#13;
    inclusive and participatory process will be facilitated by NGOs, to identify the poorest and most vulnerable households to benefit&#13;
    from the Public Works component.&#13;

UNHCR REPRESENTATIVE IN KENYA ON GPFD AND THE HORN&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;&#156;The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s regional initiative for the Horn of Africa (HoA), and the specific focus on displacement&#13;
as one of its three pillars, is a welcome innovation in the way that displacement issues are handled&#13;
in the region. In support of this initiative, the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s Global Program on Forced Displacement led an&#13;
assessment of displacement and development in the HoA, co-funded and in close coordination with&#13;
UNHCR. The process brought together the Bank, UNHCR and counterparts in Government, creating&#13;
a new platform for dialogue on future approaches to displacement challenges, not only in Kenya, but&#13;
for the region. Going forward, we should build on this as a new way of doing refugee business,&#13;
taking this new platform from the country to the regional level, for comprehensive approaches to&#13;
displacement solutions.&#13;
&#13;
In Kenya, one by-product of the assessment was the consideration of a new approach to refugee&#13;
management, following the recent influx of refugees from South Sudan into the Kakuma refugee&#13;
camp in Kenyaâ&#128;&#153;s Turkana region. The Governor of Turkana sought a new approach to refugee&#13;
management in Turkana County, working with the Bank and UNHCR, aimed at creating a&#13;
government-led regional development program, which would improve the socio-economic situation&#13;
for both the Kenyan nationals and the refugees. This would allow the refugees to be self-reliant,&#13;
build assets and maintain/develop skills until their eventual return to their country of origin, while, in&#13;
the interim contributing to the local economy. The Kenyan nationals would see improved socio-&#13;
economic and infrastructure gains, which would remain after the return of the refugees. Finally, this&#13;
approach would reduce the need for funding for basic upkeep for the refugees and allow UNHCR to&#13;
utilize its limited financial resources on protection, the search for durable solutions and critical&#13;
lifesaving activities.&#13;
&#13;
As a foundation for this initiative, the Bank was asked to undertake a socio-economic impact&#13;
assessment of the Turkana region, which would set the stage for the design of a development&#13;
program, as part of the Turkana County Integrated Development Plan. Quick funding by GPFD was&#13;
essential in getting this work started. UNHCR also provided funds to GPFD to support this study.&#13;
The Bankâ&#128;&#153;s local office also later provided supplementary funding.&#13;
&#13;
From a policy perspective this initiative is important, not just for Kenya, but for displacement&#13;
situations in other countries as well. The political messaging is important, as it signals that this&#13;
Government has the courage and foresight to acknowledge that return of the refugees will take time&#13;
and that it is therefore necessary to establish long-term policies which recognize the economic&#13;
potential of refugees, so that their presence is viewed as an asset for Kenya and its affected host&#13;
population, rather than a liability.&#13;
&#13;
If GPFD had not included a displacement focus in the Bankâ&#128;&#153;s regional initiative, it is very unlikely all&#13;
this would have happenedâ&#128;&#157;.&#13;

&amp;#12;Lake Chad Basin Region&#13;
While forced displacement in the LCB region8&#13;
is a compound consequence of social,&#13;
economic and environmental factors, conflict-&#13;
induced forced displacement due to the&#13;
intensification and regionalization of the Boko&#13;
Haram insurgency in Nigeria has emerged as&#13;
a major issue associated with an estimated&#13;
new caseload of 1.5 million IDPs in Nigeria,&#13;
82,000 IDPs in Cameroon (IOM, April-May&#13;
2015), and 133,000 refugees in Cameroon,&#13;
Chad and Niger (UNHCR, May 2015).9 From&#13;
a relatively localized conflict in the Nigerian&#13;
northeast, the Boko Haram insurgency has&#13;
gradually spread throughout the rest of the&#13;
country and, recently, across the border to&#13;
Niger, Cameroon and Chad. Most refugees&#13;
and IDPs that are forcibly displaced due to&#13;
the conflicts are being hosted in areas&#13;
characterized as lagging regions, such as the&#13;
Far North region of Cameroon, and Diffa, an&#13;
arid area in recurrent food crisis in                            This forcibly displaced man found&#13;
southeastern Niger.                                              shelter with his friends in a church&#13;
                                                                 in a town north of Bangui.&#13;
From April 24 to May 16 2015, the GSURR&#13;
country office task team conducted a joint&#13;
scoping mission to plan an â&#128;&#156;Assessment of        Photo Credit: reprinted with permission from UNHCR. (UNHCR,&#13;

the Social, Economic and Environmental&#13;
Impact of Forced Displacement in the Lake Chad Basinâ&#128;&#157;. GPFD provided technical advice to the task team and&#13;
funded the activity. The specific mission objective was to design and scope a regional assessment to analyze&#13;
the development dimensions of forced displacement including the extent, causes, character and social and&#13;
economic impact of forced displacement in Nigeria and the adjacent countries of the LCB (Niger, Chad and&#13;
Cameroon).&#13;
&#13;
The mission team found that in all the countries visited and under consideration (Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and&#13;
Chad), there is an important overlap between lagging and under-served regions and areas affected by forced&#13;
displacement. While conflict is the entry point for the forced displacement dynamics observed in the region, the&#13;
mission team also identified economic factors, natural hazards, climate change, environmental shocks,&#13;
demographic pressure, disruption of traditional livelihoods and transhumance as key drivers of forced&#13;
displacement and mixed migration in the region. Respective WBG CMUs as well as national governments are&#13;
supportive of addressing the development issues of forced displacement, while humanitarian assistance&#13;
agencies, such as UNHCR, UNOCHA and IOM, together with national authorities and development partners,&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;have been at the forefront of the response to displacement in the LCB, both in protracted and ongoing&#13;
displacement situations.&#13;
&#13;
Based on the findings from the scoping mission, the task team has recommended that a comprehensive and&#13;
holistic forced displacement assessment should be carried out jointly with UNHCR in the LCB. The assessment&#13;
will not only look into the causes of forced displacement at the regional and country-specific level, but also&#13;
include a series of highlight studies on critical emerging issues including gender, youth, mixed migration, and&#13;
micro-level social and economic impacts of forced displacement. In terms of countries of study, the task team&#13;
suggested that country specific analysis should be conducted in Nigeria and Cameroon, updates of forced&#13;
displacement analysis should be administered in Chad and Niger (previous Sahel Study countries), and&#13;
impacts of forced displacement in CAR on Cameroon and Chad should also be assessed.&#13;
&#13;
The task team aims to finish the desk-based study by the end of September 2015 and to initiate fieldwork in&#13;
Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad in early October. Country and regional level assessments are expected to&#13;
wrap up in December 2015, and the final forced displacement assessment report will be finalized in April 2016.&#13;
The team has already started to engage CMUs and national governments in order to mobilize support to&#13;
address issues relevant to forced displacement and the assessment. Additionally, the team is working on&#13;
deepening the partnership with UNHCR at the country level, and on mobilizing regional resources to carry out&#13;
the assessment in a cost-effective fashion.&#13;
&#13;
Central African Republic&#13;
The CAR has spiraled from a long-term crisis of poverty and chronic fragility, into an intercommunal conflict and&#13;
a complex humanitarian emergency. Since early 2013, the crisis has forced more than 1 million people, that is&#13;
more than a quarter of CARâ&#128;&#153;s population, to flee their homes. According to OCHA, as of June 22, 2015, the&#13;
country continued to count at least 399,000 IDPs and the number of refugees from CAR in its neighborhood&#13;
has reached a new peak with at least 458,000.&#13;
&#13;
Therefore, a study was undertaken by GPFD in late 2014, based on the specific demand by the CAR WBG country&#13;
team to determine the implications of the large scale displacement for the country and the region as a whole, in&#13;
particular with regard to economic recovery. The major findings of the study are briefly summarized below.&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢    Since December 2013, particularly Muslim neighborhoods throughout the country have been&#13;
         systematically targeted by violence. As a consequence, almost the entire Muslim population of the&#13;
         capital Bangui has fled, and the few who remained have been sheltering in what has effectively&#13;
         become a ghetto. Displacement patterns have been similar in the provinces, such as Bossangoa and&#13;
         Bouca, where there had been a sizeable and well-established Muslim presence before the crisis. As a&#13;
         result, markets have failed as transport networks and market intermediaries, roles traditionally played&#13;
         by members of the Muslim community, have disappeared.&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢    Displacement of members of the Muslim minority, has greatly contributed to the decrease of&#13;
         commodity supply and negatively impacted price levels. According to estimates, 75 percent of large&#13;
         Muslim wholesalers have fled their homes, implying a drop of related sales by 90 percent, which has&#13;
         significantly affected the countryâ&#128;&#153;s import-dependent economy. For instance, most of the trade in&#13;
         Bangui, including food and other imported commodities, was done by about 40 Muslim wholesale&#13;
         vendors, 30 of which had fled the city during the crisis. The drop in supply also impacted the price level&#13;
         that has surged since the beginning of the crisis: for example, maize, millet, and groundnuts in August&#13;
         2014 were 30-70 percent higher than in March-April 2014, according to FAO/WFP.&#13;

&#13;
    â&#128;¢   In February 2014, the UN raised concerns that 96 percent of farmers were without access to seeds to&#13;
        plant for the next agricultural season, as many of the traders, wholesalers, and interlocutors were&#13;
        Muslims that had departed or were displaced. Moreover, the livestock sector, which was in great part&#13;
        controlled by Muslims, has considerably declined due to theft, looting, mass slaughter, and&#13;
        outmigration of animals. In 2012, the pastoral sector accounted for an estimated 35 percent of&#13;
        agricultural GDP or 15 percent of GDP and represented an estimated 30-40 percent of the countryâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
        total exports, with herders predominantly being Muslim Fulani (Peuhl). Their exile contributed to a&#13;
        contraction of the livestock sector by up to 77 percent, with a further contraction estimated to 67&#13;
        percent for cattle and 77 percent for small livestock and poultry in 2014 compared to 2013.&#13;
&#13;
    â&#128;¢   The crisis in CAR has spilled over into neighboring countries in many respects, particularly due to the&#13;
        high numbers of refugees and the disruption of traditional transhumance patterns. In all host countries,&#13;
        the refugee influxes have added pressure on food security and access to social services. Humanitarian&#13;
        conditions in the border areas of Cameroon have been desperate, while in Chad, clashes between&#13;
        refugees in temporary sites and host communities have resulted in fatalities. Also the consequences of&#13;
        cross-border transhumance interruption have been significant for the pastoral economy, creating&#13;
        bottlenecks of livestock where the spread of disease and competition over resources raise significant&#13;
        challenges.&#13;
&#13;
While the humanitarian consequences of the large-scale displacement due to the CAR crisis are dire, the&#13;
economic recovery of CAR also appears to be hampered by the absence of Muslim economic operators.&#13;
Muslims in CAR have traditionally had a dominant place in the commerce and livestock sectors and have been&#13;
considered by many as the backbone of the economy. Many were traders and shopkeepers who imported&#13;
staples and they also ran the meat industry. The departure of the great majority of the traditional Muslim&#13;
economic operators is hampering the countryâ&#128;&#153;s economic recovery in a way that is still to be quantified in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;macroeconomic terms. Thus, a full resumption of economic activities requires measures that help to create&#13;
conditions favorable to the return of the Muslim economic operators.&#13;
&#13;
The study has been provided to UNHCR and its outcomes have been integrated into the new Country&#13;
Engagement Note (CEN) for CAR that has been approved by the WBG Board on July 30, 2015.&#13;

In Cote dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire, an evaluation study has been launched of the pilot project for the return of IDPs, the â&#128;&#156;Projet&#13;
dâ&#128;&#153;Urgence pour le Retour des Personnes DÃ©placÃ©es Internesâ&#128;&#157; (PUR-PDI). The preliminary report will be&#13;
available end of July 2015. The additional financing of the Post-Conflict Assistance Project has allowed the&#13;
construction of 323 houses to support the return of IDPs in western Cote dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire this past year; and an&#13;
additional 177 houses are planned in the coming six months. This activity is part of a larger community&#13;
development component, which includes: (i) construction of social infrastructures, (ii) social cohesion activities,&#13;
and (iii) support to livelihoods in 200 communities.&#13;

One of the first activities undertaken by GPFD was to fund a Political Economy Analysis (PEA) of forced&#13;
displacement in Mindanao, Philippines in 2011.10 This report provided recommendations for analytical and&#13;
operational interventions to better understand and address the causes and impacts of displacement. The main&#13;
effects of this study have been to address development challenges of land conflict in the region. The WBG&#13;
Philippines country team is currently starting joint work with IOM in support of the Transitional Justice and&#13;
Reconciliation Commission (TJRC), which was formed by the Government and the Moro Islamic Liberation&#13;
Front (MILF) in the Comprehensive Agreement on the Bangsamoro in 2014. The mandate of the TJRC&#13;
includes generating recommendations to address marginalization through unjust dispossession of land.&#13;
Working in partnership with the TJRC "Land Study Group", the joint WBG-IOM team will:&#13;
&#13;
      (i)   Contribute to the development and identification of concepts, meanings, and identities associated with&#13;
            the land issue for Christians, Muslims and indigenous peoples;&#13;
      (ii) Analyze the triggers and impact of displacement or dispossession as a result of the conflict;&#13;
      (iii) Undertake a literature review of the history of land dispossession;&#13;
      (iv) Map existing policies, programs and initiatives related to land conflict in Mindanao;&#13;
      (v) Provide recommendations on land reparations;&#13;
      (vi) Analyze legal and social feasibility of a potential local solution to land conflict in Lanao del Sur&#13;
            province;&#13;
     (vii) Facilitate private sector forums on land issues to identify proposed solutions to local conflicts.&#13;
&#13;
This work will contribute to the Study Group's report to the TJRC Commissioners and, in turn, form part of the&#13;
basis of the TJRC's final report to the Government and MILF Peace Panels, due in October 2015. Additional&#13;
resources will be provided by Australia, IOM, and the KTF.&#13;

Azerbaijan&#13;
Approximately 7 percent of Azerbaijanâ&#128;&#153;s population (around 595,000 people) is displaced, having been forced to leave&#13;
their homes in response to the 1992-1994 conflict in Nagorno-Karabakh. This makes Azerbaijan one of the countries&#13;
with the highest number of IDPs per capita in the world. This group is particularly affected by circumstance-driven&#13;
inequalities. In 2011, the WBG estimated the poverty rate of IDPs to be 25 percent, compared to 20.1 percent among&#13;
the non-displaced. IDPs remain a core stratum among the poorest 40% of the population in spite of public investment,&#13;
which has helped to relieve living conditions through improved housing and infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
Partnership between the WBG and the Government in assisting IDP communities in the country dates back to the initial&#13;
post-conflict period in the mid-1990s. The WBGâ&#128;&#153;s analytical work on livelihoods and self-reliance among IDPs has&#13;
helped influence the design of national policies towards a higher level of self-reliance among IDPs. The current IDP&#13;
â&#128;&#156;Living Standards and Livelihoods Project Loanâ&#128;&#157;11, in the amount of $50 million, became effective in February 2012. The&#13;
project objective is to improve living conditions and increase the economic self-reliance of targeted IDPs through: (i)&#13;
provision of grants to finance demand-driven micro-projects in rural infrastructure (e.g., repair of access roads, school&#13;
refurbishment); (ii) renovations of collective centers where many IDPs are housed; and, (iii) building opportunities for&#13;
rural employment and livelihood support services. Over 300 hundred communities in 32 administrative districts and&#13;
cities are being serviced under the project. An estimated 185,500 community members are expected to benefit from&#13;
infrastructure investments and livelihood support. The WBG and the government are currently preparing AF, which is&#13;
expected to become effective by the end of FY16. The project has benefitted from ongoing discussions and advice from&#13;
the GPFD, drawing on global and regional expertise.&#13;
&#13;
The community-driven nature of the project lends itself well to citizen engagement activities. Under the current project,&#13;
the target of having 50% of the total beneficiaries be female is close to being reached, with 49.2% of beneficiaries being&#13;
women. To date, 177 communities have undergone community mobilization and have implemented micro-projects and&#13;
66 collective center renovations have been completed or are near completion. All targeted youth (1300) have graduated&#13;
from or have participated in training programs; all income-generating groups (200 communities representing 2239&#13;
individuals) have been formed and 163 have already received grants; and micro-loans are fully disbursed (1608 direct&#13;
beneficiaries). A key project component is to support IDPs to help increase and diversify their sources of income. To&#13;
date, 200 cooperative, business community groups have been formed and have received technical and business&#13;
management trainings. Once the groups have developed detailed business action-plans, registered as formal Limited&#13;
Liability Companies (LLCs) and opened bank accounts, they are provided with grants averaging 9000 AZN&#13;
(approximately 9000 USD) to procure assets and supplies to start their chosen IGA. To promote ownership, the&#13;
community groups also contribute approximately 500 AZN of their own funds. The groups are comprised of between&#13;
10-12 women and men and decision-making is participatory.&#13;
&#13;
The IGAs are varied in nature and build on skills IDPs bring from their home communities. Initially, many groups chose&#13;
activities related to cattle, sheep rearing or crop production, but activities are increasingly diversified and include:&#13;
beekeeping, bakery, carpet manufacturing, event management, used building materials collection/sales, poultry rearing,&#13;
and management of retail shops, cafÃ©s, and beauty salons. An internal review points to important benefits in terms of&#13;
increased incomes and employment as well as less tangible benefits such as a renewed sense of purpose, pride and&#13;
sense of community. The capacity of IGAs to offer employment is possibly one of their most important features, and&#13;
many group members report that the employment offered by the IGAs was crucial in improving morale and providing&#13;
constructive and productive daily activities. None of the groups offered the opportunity for full-time employment yet, but&#13;

&amp;#12;all the groups visited offer part-time work to all group members, using a rotational schedule. Despite the short time that&#13;
these income-generating groups have been operating, most already generate robust incomes (up to 1,500 AZN in profit&#13;
per month).&#13;
&#13;
Beyond the immediate economic gains, both implementing partners and beneficiaries note important indirect benefits.&#13;
Through the business trainings, grants and ongoing support from the implementing partners, a significant degree of&#13;
trust seems to have been restored among community members. Beneficiaries have expressed a renewed sense of&#13;
confidence in themselves and in the future of their communities. All the encountered groups have confirmed their&#13;
intentions of prioritizing benefits to further expand the business as a way of employing and helping more community&#13;
members.&#13;
&#13;
Georgia&#13;
In the aftermath of conflicts in in 1992 and 2008, Georgia faced the displacement of more than a quarter of a&#13;
million people within the country, amounting to 5-6% of its population. The Ministry of IDPs and Refugees from&#13;
the Occupied Territories of Georgia (MRA) is responsible for coordinating responses of governmental and non-&#13;
governmental agencies to internal displacement.12 The approval of the State Strategy on IDPs in 2007, and of&#13;
the two Action Plans on Displacement, one for 2009-2012 and a subsequent one for 2012-2014, were&#13;
important steps in framing Government policy to meet the needs of IDPs. The Action Plan backs up the&#13;
Strategy with plans to provide long term solutions to the accommodation needs of IDPs, reduce their&#13;
dependency on the State, and support the integration of vulnerable IDPs into the state social assistance&#13;
programs, based on clear and transparent criteria, until their return becomes possible.13&#13;
&#13;
The work of the WBG14 builds on a long trajectory of involvement on IDP issues in Georgia, including an&#13;
assessment of IDP needs carried out in 2012, an assessment of IDP livelihoods programming in 2013,&#13;
activities with the Georgia Municipal Infrastructure Project to address the housing needs of IDPs, as well as&#13;
efforts made under the â&#128;&#156;Georgia IDP Community Development Projectâ&#128;&#157; that closed in 2013. Through this work,&#13;
the WBG has developed solid relationships with governmental and non-governmental partners in multiple&#13;
sectors and with bilateral partners.&#13;
&#13;
Currently, the WBG is supporting the Ministry of Internally Displaced Persons from the Occupied Territories,&#13;
Accommodation and Refugees on IDP issues through technical assistance to facilitate potential transition from&#13;
status-based to needs-based assistance for IDPs. To analyze the impact of this potential reform, an ongoing&#13;
study seeks to understand the daily realities for IDPs and to compare the needs of IDPs with non-IDPs citizens.&#13;
The study is composed of three sections: (i) desk analysis to identify available data and literature on IDP&#13;
housing, access to services, and access to social assistance; (ii) qualitative analysis, including focus groups&#13;
and interviews with IDPs and non-IDPs to understand citizen perspectives on how policies are affecting them&#13;
and views on the shift from status based to needs based assistance; and (iii) quantitative analysis, i.e. data&#13;
collection and/or analysis of existing statistical data, reports, and surveys of state institutions (such as the IDP&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
12&#13;
   Relevant Governmental bodies include Including the Ministry of Health, Labor and Social Affairs (MHLSA) who administers the&#13;
 disbursement of IDP allowances, the Ministry of Regional Development and Infrastructure (MRDI) in charge of the Municipal&#13;
 Development Funds (MDF) under which much housing rehabilitation has occurred, the Ministry of Justice responsible for issuing&#13;
 house ownership documents for IDPs, and the Ministry of Interior in charge of land issues and construction in connection with the&#13;
 new houses. The MRA also chairs various coordination fora (such as the Steering Group on IDPs) aimed at increasing information&#13;
 sharing and policy development between government, international donors, and implementing agencies.&#13;

The current technical assistance work in Georgia has benefitted from the GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s extensive work on political&#13;
economy analysis. An understanding of how political economy can affect the potential for reform in Georgia is&#13;
embedded into the analysis and will be embedded into recommendations. Recommendations will be shared&#13;
with GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s community of practice and this global knowledge will ensure that final recommendations to the&#13;
Government reflect global best practices.&#13;

Turkey&#13;
A review of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Turkey in 2014 was an opportunity to put greater&#13;
emphasis on understanding the constraints to eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity&#13;
in the country. There was concern over the regional dimensions of poverty in Turkey - the south-east&#13;
lagging behind the rest of the country on many dimensions of poverty â&#128;&#147; and under-development, which could&#13;
be compounded by the impact of the Syrian crisis. With Turkey now hosting the largest number of refugees in&#13;
the world, amounting to over 2 million people,15 analysis on this issue was key to understanding the effects on&#13;
hosting communities. An initial scoping mission and desk review by GPFD helped a task team and the country&#13;
office to formulate an engagement with the Government on the Syrian refugee crisis. There is now proposed&#13;
work with the Government on a large-scale survey that will help quantify the impact of the crisis on Turkish host&#13;
communities, with the potential to inform Government policy. The availability of initial seed funding for this work&#13;
from GPFD was instrumental in leveraging additional resources from other WBG sources and from SIDA.&#13;

Ukraine&#13;
As of mid-2015, more than 2.3 million people are displaced both internally (1.4 million) and outside of Ukraine (900,000)&#13;
since the outbreak of conflict in Eastern Ukraine in March 2014. As the conflict continues, both humanitarian and&#13;
development impacts are felt by both displaced and host communities. Humanitarian needs - such as emergency&#13;
provision of shelter, food, and basic needs for the vulnerable - are increasingly paired with development and poverty&#13;
reduction issues-service delivery deficits, overburdened social welfare services, joblessness, increasing social tensions,&#13;
and deteriorating debt and credit relations. Long-term displacement contributes to recurrent cycles of insecurity, can&#13;
erode citizen confidence and imposes burdens on state structures and public finance. As a result, conflict and&#13;
displacement have contributed to social instability, labor and price distortions, service delivery deficits, and the rise of&#13;
divisive identity politics, particularly in the east of the country.&#13;
&#13;
In response to the crisis, GPFD was requested to prepare a social context analysis of forced displacement that&#13;
surveyed the scope, triggers, and impacts of the displacement crisis at national, oblast and raion levels. This analysis&#13;
informed the subsequent Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment (RPA) for Ukraine that GPFD, other WBG&#13;
colleagues, the EU, and UN concluded in April 2015. GPFD analysis provided baseline and projection data for&#13;
assessments of sectoral impacts and projected recovery costs for conflict affected areas of eastern Ukraine, ensuring&#13;
that the developmental impacts of forced displacement were mainstreamed into the costing and operational&#13;
recommendations of the RPA while raising the profile of the development impacts of forced displacement for&#13;
counterparts in the Ukrainian government. GPFD provided analysis of WBG operations in similar situations of forced&#13;
displacement within other countries to inform recommendations and prospective programming for Ukraine. GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
displacement analysis for Ukraine was a key component of GSURRâ&#128;&#153;s Knowledge Product on â&#128;&#152;Conflict Mainstreamingâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
for Ukraine to inform future WBG strategy and operations to be more conflict and displacement sensitive. GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
analysis is also contributing to the design of a combined governance/conflict filter to be applied across the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
portfolio in Ukraine, informing a prospective WBG operation on community social support which will include a focus on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

                                                            35&#13;
&amp;#12;communities hosting IDPs, and providing a foundation for possible future WBG programming focused on the&#13;
development implications of the displacement crisis.&#13;
&#13;
In FY16, GPFD has been asked to continue to update its displacement analysis as the crisis continues, work&#13;
with the Ukraine team in further analysis and survey efforts of displaced populations and host communities, and&#13;
contribute inputs as part of Ukraineâ&#128;&#153;s upcoming SCD and CPF development efforts. GPFD will also play a key&#13;
role in providing global experience and lessons from other country contexts in designing policies and programs&#13;
- particularly on issues such as return triggers, employment and livelihood support, and social cohesion.&#13;

Colombia&#13;
Protracted armed violence between the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC), Criminal&#13;
Bands (BACRIM), the EjÃ©rcito de LiberaciÃ³n Nacional (ELN) and the Government has led to one of the highest&#13;
levels of internal displacement in the world, amounting to over 5 million people by the end of 201416. Since the&#13;
publication in 2011, of the â&#128;&#156;Victims Lawâ&#128;&#157;, the Government continues to gradually deploy a set of individual and&#13;
collective reparation measures, including land and financial restitution, compensation, rehabilitation, psycho-&#13;
social support and guarantees of non-repetition. GPFD engaged with the Victimsâ&#128;&#153; Unit in the early development&#13;
and implementation of the Victimsâ&#128;&#153; Law and the WBG developed a package of Programmatic Knowledge&#13;
Services (PKS) to promote sustainable implementation practices that learn from small-scale pilots targeting&#13;
violence prevention, citizen security, reconciliation and land restitution. GPFD also supported a proposal to the&#13;
Colombia Peace and Post-Conflict Fund to catalyze in this approach.&#13;
&#13;
Since 2012, 96,912 requests for protection of land assets from IDPs have been met, 1,194 titles to occupants&#13;
have been awarded, and important contributions to the regulation of the restitution chapter of the Restitution&#13;
Law have been offered, while supporting the design of decrees about land restitution to ethnic minorities. The&#13;
grant has also supported the Land Restitution Unit (LRU) to organize the processes for land restitution. As a&#13;
result, 24 land restitution offices have been established throughout the country and 72,62317 requests for&#13;
restitution have been received. A total of 25,406 of the requests have been processed18, of which, 9,695 have&#13;
been included in the RTDAF19, and 1,852 cases have been decided. Regarding ethnic minorities, 19 cases&#13;
have started the judicial process, of which one is already resolved.&#13;

MENA: The Middle East and North Africa&#13;
The civil war in Syria has made that country the largest source of cross border and internal displacement worldwide,&#13;
with 7.7 million IDPs and 4.0 million refugees. Turkey hosts the largest number of exiled Syrians (over 2 million),&#13;
followed by Lebanon (1.2 million), Jordan (630,000), Iraq (250,000) and Egypt (139,000). This influx raises the total&#13;
population of Lebanon by almost 30 percent and between 5-10 percent for Jordan. Adding to the alarmingly high totals&#13;
from Syria in the region is new displacement of least 3.0 million people in Iraq and 309,000 people newly displaced in&#13;

&amp;#12;Libya. The combined effects of these crises has made MENA the region the worldâ&#128;&#153;s largest producer and host of forced&#13;
displacement.&#13;
&#13;
In addition to displacement caused by recent conflicts, several of the countries in the MENA region continue to host&#13;
refugees from previous conflicts, including an estimated 5 million Palestinian refugees, 750,000 Iraqis from previous&#13;
wars, and 48,000 Sahrawis living in refugee camps in Algeria, displaced by the conflict in Western Sahara. Overall, the&#13;
magnitude of the problem puts the MENA region at the center of the global displacement crisis.&#13;
&#13;
MENA: WBG Response&#13;
While the challenges posed by large-scale displacement flows have traditionally been regarded as&#13;
humanitarian in nature, the duration and scale of these population movements in the MENA region have&#13;
revealed the significant long-term development impacts that these crises have on the displaced and hosts alike.&#13;
These effects on governance, housing, service delivery and livelihoods are most keenly felt in host areas that&#13;
may have already experienced deficits prior to forced displacement inflows.&#13;
&#13;
Governments are normally reluctant to borrow in order to finance expenditures related to refugees, yet the&#13;
WBGâ&#128;&#153;s MENA region has been able to support the displaced and host governments and populations in a&#13;
number of ways, including providing multi-sectoral expertise in dialogue with Governments and an ability to&#13;
leverage partnerships and funding from other key actors.&#13;
&#13;
The WBGâ&#128;&#153;s operational portfolio addressing displacement needs in the MENA region has grown over the last&#13;
several years. In the early stages of the Syrian crisis, projects tended to focus on the needs of refugees and&#13;
directly affected host populations and were typically implemented by NGOs. However, as the burden of hosting&#13;
Syrian refugees began to weigh more heavily on receiving governments, WBG support has moved toward&#13;
support for host communities and governments to complement continuing, largely humanitarian support being&#13;
given to refugees. In practice this has meant that the WBG has focused on activities aimed at safeguarding&#13;
development achievements, promoting social stability, enhancing service delivery, and emphasizing the role&#13;
that good analytics can play in understanding the social and economic impacts of regional displacement. There&#13;
has been less support to IDP populations in Syria or Iraq, largely due to access issues, yet national programs&#13;
(e.g. social protection, education and health operations) have adjusted, in the case of Iraq, to be more&#13;
cognizant of the vulnerability of IDPs.&#13;
&#13;
The WBG has significantly increased the amount of analytical work it conducts in the region, augmenting its&#13;
ability to design appropriate operations, provide technical advice, convene stakeholders, and engage in policy&#13;
dialogue with local clients. GPFD has served as a custodian of WBG knowledge on displacement, both&#13;
commissioning and directly conducting much of this research for external and internal consumption.&#13;
&#13;
Many governments are struggling with the challenge of protracted refugee presence in their respective&#13;
countries. In addition, discourse on forced displacement is politically sensitive, even controversial. As a result,&#13;
financing displacement-oriented operations remains a challenge as the regionâ&#128;&#153;s middle-income countries are&#13;
not eligible for concessional financing from the WBG and are reluctant to borrow for what they view as a global&#13;
public good. Moreover, applicable trust funds are insufficient to meet demand. In the fifth year of the regionâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
crises the WBG has leveraged $50+ millions of grant financing in Jordan and $75 million in Lebanon, amounts&#13;
that are clearly not commensurate with the scale of the challenge facing these countries.&#13;

&amp;#12;GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s Regional Work in MENA&#13;
At a regional level, GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s operational engagements include:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   GPFD led the SPF-funded â&#128;&#156;5M: Displaced People in Jordan/Lebanonâ&#128;&#157; project designed to pilot approaches to&#13;
    mitigating the impact of Syrian crisis in select localities in Lebanon and Jordan. Save the Children was engaged to&#13;
    implement activities focusing on early childhood development, education and livelihoods. The work on the SPF&#13;
    grant inspired wide discussion in the WBG country team on how best the WBG could support mitigation of the&#13;
    impact of Syrian refugees and a portfolio review was undertaken to this end. Activities under this program recently&#13;
    came to a close.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   GPFD is part of core task team of the â&#128;&#156;Jordan Emergency Services and Social Resilience Projectâ&#128;&#157; (JESSRP),&#13;
    designed in response to the Syrian crisis to address the strains on municipalities regarding local public service&#13;
    delivery to refugees as well as host communities, who are increasingly adversely affected by the crisis.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   GPFD is also part of the â&#128;&#156;Lebanon Municipal Services Emergency Projectâ&#128;&#157; providing advice to the task team to&#13;
    help address urgent displacement-related communityâ&#128;&#147;level service delivery impacts in selected municipalities.&#13;
&#13;
GPFD is also playing a supporting role in:&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   Providing technical advice and content input for the survey instruments to be used in the upcoming Household&#13;
    Needs Surveys of refugee and host families in Iraq, Lebanon, and Jordan. Additional GPFD support for this&#13;
    exercise includes funding made available for third party qualitative assessments of the impacts of Syrian refugees&#13;
    on host communities in these three countries.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   GPFD is supporting the development of a WBG-executed capacity building exercise planned to assist the statistic&#13;
    offices in the Kurdistan region of Iraq and in Baghdad better assess the scope of forced displacement in Iraq.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   GPFD has provided upstream technical advice for the recent $350 million loan to the Government of Iraq in support&#13;
    of reconstruction of â&#128;&#156;liberated areasâ&#128;&#157; of the country. GPFD contributed advice on the viability and appropriate&#13;
    mechanisms for working with selected ministries and target locations in Anbar and Ninewa governorates, based on&#13;
    recent GPFD staff experience in the country and past social context analyses of the area.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   At the corporate level, GPFD continues to participate in the development of a new MENA strategy within the WBG,&#13;
    with particular emphasis on the recovery and resilience pillars of the four pillar orientation of the emergent strategy&#13;
    that focus on the impacts of forced displacement on recovery and the resilience of refugees, returnees, and&#13;
    affected host and return communities.&#13;
&#13;
Syria Information and Research Initiative (SIRI)&#13;
As part of the Syria Information and Research Initiative (SIRI) launched in end-2013, the MENA region launched a&#13;
remote damage assessment for the Darâ&#128;&#153;a Governorate on a pilot basis to explore the potential of using satellite imagery&#13;
supported by ground information through UN agencies and other humanitarian actors, to compile damage data and&#13;
assess damage impact for the Housing, Health, Education, and Agriculture sectors. This was coupled with an&#13;
assessment of secondary data by GPFD from select districts in Darâ&#128;&#153;a to assess displacement flows, return intentions,&#13;
drivers of displacement and enabling conditions for return. Based on the results of the pilot and lessons learned, MENA&#13;
region decided to scale up the assessment to cover six cities, i.e., Darâ&#128;&#153;a, Idlib, Latakia, Homs, Hama, and Aleppo, with a&#13;
focus on assessing damage in Housing, Health, Education, Transport, Energy, and Water and Sanitation sectors in the&#13;
cities, and Agriculture sector in the governorates. Importantly, there was also a recognition that any damage&#13;
assessment should be conducted in parallel with a needs analysis looking at drivers of displacement and enabling&#13;
conditions to draw the displaced toward home areas.&#13;

&amp;#12;While reviewing the lessons learned during the Darâ&#128;&#153;a pilot and determining the scope of the scaled up assessment,&#13;
GPFD emphasized the importance of understanding the change in the human terrain due to displacement resulting&#13;
from the conflict, in order to better assess the needs of the population in particular. Recognizing that recovery needs&#13;
would have to be defined and assessed keeping in view the enabling environment that would have to be created for&#13;
future return of the displaced population, the assessment team reached out to GPFD to lead this aspect of the&#13;
assessment.&#13;

 QUOTE: SHANTAYANAN DEVARAJAN | MENA CHIEF ECONOMIST&#13;
&#13;
 â&#128;&#156;Over the last few years, along with the severity of the Syrian crisis, the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s work on forced&#13;
 displacement has increased exponentially in the MENA region. As the WBG developed pilot&#13;
 programs, analytical work and later lending and grant funded operations to address&#13;
 development needs in connection with forced displacement, it has been very important to draw&#13;
 on the expertise, flexible resources and knowledge of the Global Program on Forced&#13;
 Displacement.&#13;
 Input from GPFD has recently been particularly important to provide the platform for sharing&#13;
 experiences between the MENA and AFR regions on how best to tackle the growing&#13;
 displacement related development challenges in the two regions, leading to agreement on&#13;
 undertaking a major â&#128;&#156;flagshipâ&#128;&#157; assessment of the economic impact and operational experiences&#13;
 of forced displacement. This work will be led by GPFD in close collaboration with the MENA&#13;
 and AFR Chief Economist offices and the effort will be co-funded.&#13;
 Lastly and perhaps most significantly, GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s input has been inspirational, concrete and&#13;
 hands-on in the development of the new MENA strategy, one of whose pillars has a strong&#13;
 focus on refugees and forced displacement. We continue to draw on GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s expertise as the&#13;
 strategy is being finalized for Board presentation in September; and we will need GPFD even&#13;
 more in the future when we apply the strategy to client dialogue, partnership engagement, and&#13;
 design of WBG operations.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
GPFD provided insight on the drivers and enabling conditions that would influence the future movements and&#13;
potential return of displaced populations based on tapping existing surveys available in the public domain and&#13;
social media analysis. This is the first time such a damage and needs assessment approach has been used to&#13;
assess perceptions remotely. The primary study period was scoped to January 2014 through December 2014,&#13;
though data up through June 2015 that enhances understanding of population shifts and needs was included&#13;
as available. The cities of focus were Darâ&#128;&#153;a, Aleppo, and Homs. GPFD examined correlations that appear to&#13;
exist between the status of basic services (damage) and displacement flows. Generally, across the three cities&#13;
examined in this assessment, the most influential factors pushing and pulling displacement and return flows&#13;
were security, shelter, access to land and livelihood assets, restoration of basic services, and political as well&#13;
as kinship affiliation considerations. Each city has a unique signature of drivers and enabling conditions that&#13;
impact population movements and return decisions. A key conclusion of this innovative analysis was that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                          39&#13;
&amp;#12;enabling conditions that pull IDPs and refugees back home should be durable enough to ensure continued&#13;
recovery and reintegration over time.&#13;
&#13;
MENA Policies and Practice for the Economic Inclusion of Refugees&#13;
GPFD also contributed to the WBG paper, â&#128;&#156;Policies and Practice for the Economic Inclusion of Refugeesâ&#128;&#157;,&#13;
examining the modalities for the economic inclusion of refugees in advanced industrial economies. The&#13;
underlying assumption of this work is that employment is a key indicator of integration, ensuring self-&#13;
sufficiency, economic well-being and independence. The paper develops and elaborates a three-fold typology&#13;
of facilitating, constraining and mediating variables to assess the process of economic inclusion. Refugee&#13;
access to labor markets is most likely to be spontaneous but can be enhanced by facilitating factors such as&#13;
language skills, training and qualifications recognition. These are sometimes incorporated into national policy&#13;
frameworks for refugee integration. Conversely, the paper shows how structural and situational factors such as&#13;
refugee status determination procedures constrain or act as barriers to access. Finally the paper shows how to&#13;
demonstrate that wider mediating variables, such as macro- and micro- economic conditions and fiscal policy,&#13;
delineate contextual conditions which determine employment opportunities and labor market access.&#13;
&#13;
Challenges in MENA, going forward&#13;
It is unlikely that the conflicts driving forced displacement in MENA â&#128;&#147; particularly those related to Iraq, Syria, and Yemen&#13;
â&#128;&#147; will be resolved anytime soon. Continued violence in the region will increase the numbers of refugees and IDPs and&#13;
the duration of displacement may exceed fifteen years if present trends continue. Current policies and interim support&#13;
strategies are inappropriate and unsustainable for this scale and length of forced displacement.&#13;
&#13;
A second challenge results from assessments of the damage in key cities within Syria that indicate that it will take many&#13;
years of reconstruction, once that is possible, before people will be able to go back to their homes in that country. In&#13;
addition, surveys of Syrian refugees in the region and evidence from inside of Syria suggest that up to 20 percent of&#13;
forcibly displaced Syrians have no intention to return to homes of origin. This amounts to 2.2 million persons choosing to&#13;
remain in place or to move to locations in the region or within Syria other than their homes of record.20&#13;
&#13;
A third challenge results from the majority of refugees and IDPs in the region that have settled in urban areas outside of&#13;
formal camp settlements or in public (or unfinished) buildings. These individuals and families are increasingly&#13;
unregistered and enmeshed in an informal survival economy that is often exploitative and detrimental to host&#13;
populations.&#13;
&#13;
Without sustained policy dialogue with clients and continued support in the form of developmental operations and&#13;
analytical work, the long-term impacts of forced displacement in MENA will contribute to a reversal of development&#13;
achievements, additional strains on public finance, and deteriorating social cohesion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

  At 2.2 million persons remaining displaced, this would constitute the fifth largest internal displacement crisis globally behind&#13;
 Colombia, Iraq, Sudan, and the DRC&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                   40&#13;
&amp;#12;SAR: South Asia&#13;
Afghanistan&#13;
According to UNHCR, conflict in Afghanistan has resulted in a current number of more than 2.7 million&#13;
refugees and 683,000 IDPs. More than 5.8 million Afghan refugees have returned to their country since&#13;
2002. In the region, Pakistan and Iran host more than 2.4 million refugees, and in addition, Pakistan has&#13;
715,000 IDPs and an even larger number of irregular migrants. Recent military operations in North&#13;
Waziristan have displaced more than 13,000 families across the border into Afghanistan, making forced&#13;
displacement an important regional issue. Due to a variety of reasons, but especially a lack of job&#13;
opportunities, shelter/access to land and, in some instances security, around 15% of these returnees&#13;
did not return to or remain in their communities of origin and have become displaced for a second time.&#13;
Simultaneously, growing insecurity has resulted in increasing numbers of new IDPs in different parts of&#13;
the country. While many have moved to the larger cities, including Kabul, in search of livelihood&#13;
opportunities and security, others have migrated to neighboring countries in search of jobs.&#13;
&#13;
A WBG/UNHCR study (2011) 21 identified mixed motives among urban IDPs, regarding return to place of&#13;
origin, comprising both push and pull factors. Two key challenges affecting IDPs and refugee/IDP&#13;
returnees were identified. First, a lack of restoration of property rights and landlessness were seen as&#13;
the main obstacles to durable solutions. Insufficient documentation, competing land claims and land&#13;
grabbing, and judicial corruption have hindered the resolution of property disputes. The inability to&#13;
reclaim lost lands has undermined the sustainability of previous returns. A weak judiciary further&#13;
hampers the access to land and rights for returnees and IDPs (UNHCR 2011). Second, lack of shelter&#13;
and insufficient job opportunities or services in rural areas also prevent IDPs from returning home or&#13;
sustainably resettling elsewhere.&#13;
&#13;
The body of research on forced displacement in Afghanistan has been conducted by humanitarian&#13;
actors for humanitarian actors. But despite considerable investment and effort by both development and&#13;
humanitarian actors, refugee return has proven hard to prioritize in the governmentâ&#128;&#153;s development&#13;
policy agenda. Instead, there has been hope and an assumption that once immediate needs and&#13;
displacement-related vulnerabilities are addressed, long-term solutions would be mainstreamed into&#13;
national priority programs. However, this has not always been the case and returnees and IDPs are&#13;
generally among the most vulnerable sections of society. International research suggests that forced&#13;
displacement should not only be viewed as a humanitarian challenge, but equally as a development&#13;
concern. A regional shift in thinking is therefore necessary to ensure poverty reduction and growth as&#13;
well as to reduce societal vulnerabilities of forcibly displaced groups and their host communities.&#13;
&#13;
The WBG has commissioned a stock-taking exercise in order to assess the quantity and quality of&#13;
existing data collected by humanitarian agencies, bilaterals and others. The inspiration for this study&#13;
came from GPFD, which is also funding it, while the design, drawing on GPFD global experience, was&#13;
jointly developed with the WBG Afghanistan country team. UNHCR was also consulted and will work&#13;
with the WBG on this important exercise. The stock-take will identify the current socio-economic and&#13;
spatial profile of IDPs and returnees, capture ongoing development in the area (increased number of&#13;
returnees), and identify areas where further analysis is required in order to provide policy&#13;
recommendations to the Afghan Government. The main objective is to lay the ground for more effective&#13;

Sri Lanka&#13;
The Northern and Eastern Provinces of Sri Lanka were ravaged by the internal armed conflict over almost three&#13;
decades and is estimated to have cost the lives of about 70,000 people. On May 19, 2009 the President of Sri&#13;
Lanka announced the end of the conflict and brought back the entire Northern Province under Government&#13;
control. Large-scale displacement occurred during the conflict, especially in the last period of the intensified&#13;
armed conflict in 2008 and 2009. The conflict stunted development in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, and&#13;
also negatively affected growth in the country at large. Despite the conflict, the Government, assisted by donors&#13;
including the WBG, implemented several programs for emergency welfare, livelihood assistance and&#13;
rehabilitation in these areas.&#13;
&#13;
In order to start reconstruction of the North, the Government prepared a 180-day plan, which included four&#13;
main activities: (i) demining; (ii) return and resettlement for IDPs; (iii) provision of basic welfare, infrastructure,&#13;
and social services; and (iv) support to resume livelihoods of the IDPs. The WBG prepared the â&#128;&#156;Emergency&#13;
Northern Recovery Projectâ&#128;&#157; with the Government and the project was approved in December 2009. The&#13;
development objective of the project was to support the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s efforts to rapidly resettle the IDPs in the&#13;
Northern Province by creating an enabling environment.&#13;
&#13;
Project design was simple and incorporated lessons learned in past and on-going projects in the region, as well&#13;
as in other post conflict operations in Sri Lanka and elsewhere. These lessons highlighted the need to: (i)&#13;
provide immediate help to returnees; (ii) balance livelihood support with the rehabilitation of public services and&#13;
basic infrastructure; and (iii) ensure adequate implementation arrangements are in place right from project&#13;
start-up. The inclusion of technical and financial auditing design elements improved the accuracy of the costing&#13;
of geographically scattered civil works ($60 million), while ensuring their construction quality and proper&#13;
contract management.&#13;
&#13;
At negotiations, the projectâ&#128;&#153;s primary target group was 100,000 IDPs out of a total of 290,000 people who were&#13;
living in Government camps in July 2009. A large majority of the IDPs targeted under the project were people&#13;
displaced consequent to intensified fighting between Armed Forces of the Government and the rebels of the&#13;
North in 2008 up to May 2009. The project assisted not only the IDPs in the welfare camps, but also the IDPs&#13;
who returned from relatives, friends and abroad, amounting to 147,414 persons.&#13;
&#13;
This is one of the largest WBG projects focusing on forced displacement in a difficult environment. GPFD is&#13;
continuing to engage with the country team to extract lessons for the design and implementation of future&#13;
operations.&#13;

3. ANALYTICAL WORK&#13;
Over the past year, GPFD has focused its analytical work on strengthening the evidence base for development&#13;
work on forced displacement. GPFD is currently compiling a comprehensive overview of all WBG Economic&#13;
and Social Impact Assessments (ESIA) of forced displacement â&#128;&#147; a work stream that is receiving increasing&#13;
attention. The program has also spearheaded three key studies in the Sahel, Great Lakes and Horn regions of&#13;
Africa, which have examined the development dimensions of forced displacement and informed the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
regional initiatives. GPFD is in the process of completing its work on a number of key thematic issues, such as&#13;
sustainable refugee return, urban displacement, land, livelihoods and gender. Following demand from the AFR&#13;
and MENA VP offices of the WBG, as well as their respective Chief Economists, GPFD will lead a major&#13;
flagship on the economic, social and fiscal impacts and operational experiences of forced displacement in&#13;
FY16. This work will help to cement forced displacement as a development issue for the WBG, and the findings&#13;
will inform the WBG and its partnersâ&#128;&#153; work on forced displacement going forward, as well as feeding into the&#13;
discussions at the WHS in May 2016. Dissemination of this analytical work over the past year has contributed&#13;
to an increase in awareness across the WBG of the development impact of conflict induced forced&#13;
displacement and to a strengthened WBG response, evidenced by the growing number of operations that&#13;
address the social and economic impacts on the displaced and their host or return communities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Thematic Analytical Work&#13;
Analytical Work on Economic and Social Impacts of Forced Displacement&#13;
Over the last 18 months, the WBG has expanded its efforts to quantify the impacts of forced&#13;
displacement on host countries and to estimate the welfare impacts for host communities and displaced&#13;
populations through ESIAs. The goal of this work is to strengthen operational responses that relieve&#13;
fiscal pressure on host countries, restore access to infrastructure and services, and support welfare&#13;
improvements for the poor and vulnerable displaced and host populations.&#13;
&#13;
A starting point for this body of work was the mixed methods approach developed by GPFD, Oxford&#13;
RSC, FAFO, and PRIO and documented in the â&#128;&#156;Guidelines for Assessing the Impacts and Costs of&#13;
Forced Displacementâ&#128;&#157;, â&#128;&#156;Assessing the Impacts and Costs of Forced Displacement â&#128;&#147; A Mixed Methods&#13;
Approach, Volume Iâ&#128;&#157;, and â&#128;&#156;Volume II: Study on Impacts and Costs of Forced Displacement â&#128;&#147; State of&#13;
the Art Literature Reviewâ&#128;&#157;. The methodology was first applied in Jordan in 2012 to assess the impact of&#13;
the influx of Syrian refugees. However, the exercise did not adequately quantify the fiscal impact of&#13;
forced displacement. Subsequent dialogue between the WBG and the Government led to: (i) the $150&#13;
million â&#128;&#156;Emergency Project to Assist Jordan Partially Mitigate Impact of Syrian Conflictâ&#128;&#157; that aims to&#13;
maintain access to essential healthcare services and basic household needs for the Jordanian&#13;
population affected by the influx of Syrian refugees; and (ii) the $53 million â&#128;&#156;Jordan Emergency Services&#13;
and Social Resilience Projectâ&#128;&#157; that provides assistance to municipalities and host communities to&#13;
address immediate service delivery impacts of Syrian refugee inflows and strengthen municipal capacity&#13;
to support local economic development.&#13;
&#13;
GPFD is providing technical support to a number of these ESIAs and building on this momentum by&#13;
preparing an overview, illustrated by the table below, not only of ESIAs as such, but also of major&#13;
studies that have components that measure the social and/or economic impact of forced displacement&#13;
in its various forms. The methods and outcomes of these assessments will feed into the flagship&#13;
analytical work to be undertaken in FY16.&#13;
&#13;

the crisis on IDPs in Bamako, refugees in camps in Mauritania and Niger, and returnees in the regional capitals&#13;
of Gao, Timbuktu and Kidal, using data from a face-to-face household survey and follow-up interviews with&#13;
baseline respondents using mobile phones. Beginning in August 2014, the WBG has tracked the welfare of&#13;
displaced people in Mali on a monthly basis. The baseline survey showed that better-educated and wealthier&#13;
households fled the crisis, the welfare of the displaced declined considerably, and significant amounts of&#13;
durable goods (20-60 percent) and animals (75-90 percent) were lost. Follow up interviews have revealed that&#13;
over time the impact of the crisis has diminished, and by February 2015 most eligible children were going to&#13;
school and employment levels and number of meals consumed were at pre-crisis levels. The survey data also&#13;
show that different ethnic groups chose different places of refuge, and depending on their location, the&#13;
narrative of the crisis and the solutions they envisage are vastly different. GPFD provided crucial support for&#13;
this work by mobilizing resources from the KTF, providing co-funding of $75,000, facilitating discussions with&#13;
UNHCR, and providing technical input to the concept note and survey instruments. This innovative work is of&#13;
importance to frame future policy and planning dialogue with affected governments and UNHCR on how best to&#13;
promote solutions to forced displacement.&#13;
&#13;
The Peculiar Dynamics of the Kakuma Refugee Camp: An Economic and Social Impact Analysis&#13;
In Kenya, GPFD provided substantial seed funding of $250,000 (including $50,000 from UNHCR), and the&#13;
country office provided co-financing for â&#128;&#156;The Peculiar Dynamics of the Kakuma Refugee Camp: An Economic&#13;
and Social Impact Analysisâ&#128;&#157;. GPFD was intimately involved in the preparation of the Concept Note, approved in&#13;
May 2015, for this analysis. The study will evaluate the economic and social impact of refugees on host&#13;

&amp;#12;communities in Turkana County. Recognizing that there are other factors impacting on the welfare of host&#13;
communities over the 20-year lifespan of the camp, the analysis aims to construct a counterfactual to isolate&#13;
the changes caused by the presence of refugees. An original survey was carried out in Kakuma in June/July&#13;
2015 and another town to collect data on household demographics, remittances, employment opportunities and&#13;
trends, wage rates, and prices in food, labor, cattle and housing markets. Apurva Sanghi, the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s Lead&#13;
Economist in charge of the Kakuma study, published an external blog post inspired by the study on the&#13;
Brookings website titled â&#128;&#156;The peculiar economics of a refugee camp: â&#128;&#156;Yes in my backyardâ&#128;&#157;,22 about the need to&#13;
â&#128;&#156;do things differentlyâ&#128;&#157; and giving his perspective on the economics of displacement and the effect on host&#13;
populations.&#13;
&#13;
MENA analytical initiatives on the economic and social impact of crises in Syria and Iraq&#13;
In MENA, several analytical initiatives are underway to evaluate the economic and social impacts of the crises in Syria&#13;
and Iraq including the impact of forced displacement. In addition to the Lebanon Economic and Social Impact&#13;
Assessment of the Syrian Conflict described above, impact assessments have been completed in Iraq KRG, Lebanon&#13;
and Jordan, and the Levant region and additional studies are underway in Iraq, Lebanon and Jordan.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢    GPFD provided technical input to the design of â&#128;&#156;The Kurdistan Region of Iraq: Assessing the Economic and Social&#13;
     Impact of the Syrian Conflict and ISISâ&#128;&#157; and provided ongoing support to the team, including funding for an expert&#13;
     from GPFD to participate in the mission and contribute technical inputs. The assessment quantifies the&#13;
     macroeconomic and fiscal impacts of the Syrian war and Islamic State insurgency on the Kurdistan Region of Iraq&#13;
     and the cost of restoring access to and quality of services to pre-crisis levels.23&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢    The WBG is leading an initiative in Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq to evaluate the socio-economic impact of the regional&#13;
     crises on Syrian refugee and host community populations. Data on living conditions, access to services and&#13;
     economic opportunities, coping strategies and economic status are to be collected via a specialized household&#13;
     survey and a sub-component of the survey will be carried out on a semi-annual basis to continue to monitor and&#13;
     adapt support as needed. GPFD facilitated $1.1 million of funding of this activity including $900,000 from a&#13;
     Denmark-led EU project and $200,000 from UNHCR. GPFD also provided technical input to the Concept Note,&#13;
     design of the sampling strategy and development of the survey questionnaire.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢    A study on â&#128;&#156;The Economic Effects of the Syrian War and the Spread of the Islamic State on the Levantâ&#128;&#157;, while not&#13;
     supported by GPFD, is part of the growing analytics on the economics of forced displacement. The study uses a&#13;
     global computable general-equilibrium framework with new detail on six Levant countries - Egypt, Iraq, Jordan,&#13;
     Lebanon, Syria and Turkey24 - to quantify the direct and indirect economic effects of the Syrian war and the&#13;
     advance of the Islamic State on the Levant including labor force and population effects of refugee flows. The study&#13;
     shows that refugee hosting countries lose in per capita terms but gain in aggregate terms as the influx of refugees&#13;
     boosts their population numbers, increasing demand for goods and services (aggregate consumption and&#13;
     investment) and labor supply.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢    GPFD has provided technical advice during the concept stage for the â&#128;&#156;Iraq Crisis Responseâ&#128;&#157; study, which will&#13;
     assess the impact of the Islamic State and oil price-related crises on IDPs and households left behind in IS&#13;
     controlled areas.&#13;

    Needs of Syrian Refugeesâ&#128;&#157;, which will: (i) compare the socio-economic profile of refugees with that of the Syrian&#13;
    population before the crisis and with the hosting populations of Jordan and Lebanon; (ii) provide a welfare and&#13;
    vulnerability assessment of Syrian refugees including a poverty profile, the socio-economic characteristics of higher&#13;
    poverty and where pockets of deep poverty are located; (iii) analyze key drivers of welfare and poverty; and (iv)&#13;
    model monetary and non-monetary vulnerability. Data will be drawn from three existing UNHCR databases.&#13;
&#13;
â&#128;¢   In Libya, GPFD has provided $60,000 for an economic and social impact assessment of conflict-induced&#13;

Somalia Household Survey, SKOPE, and Somaliland Poverty Assessment&#13;
In Somalia, three studies that focus on the displacement dimensions are underway and completed. They are:&#13;
(i) the Mogadishu Household Survey, (ii) the Somalia Knowledge for Operations and Political Economy Study&#13;
(SKOPE), and (iii) the Somaliland Poverty Assessment. The pilot for the Mogadishu Household Survey has&#13;
been completed, with fieldwork aligned with the two other Somalia studies for comparability. SKOPE fieldwork&#13;

&amp;#12;began this summer (2015), and results are expected at the end the calendar year. The Somaliland&#13;
Poverty Assessment, completed by the Poverty GP and AFR, completed an intermediate report in&#13;
January 2015 and finalized findings in June 2015. The report found that more than 1 in 3 people in the&#13;
settled parts of rural Somaliland and more than 1 in 4 people in urban Somaliland were living in poverty.&#13;
Lack of employment and high food prices were cited by households as a larger risk to welfare than&#13;
conflict.&#13;
&#13;
South Sudan IDP study&#13;
GPFD has provided technical input to the Concept Note and funded an STC to provide input to the&#13;
design of an IDP Study in South Sudan that aims to assess the economic needs of IDPs and host&#13;
communities in urban areas. The National Bureau of Statistics has yet to finalize the design. The&#13;
proposed design of the project is to conduct a multi-sectoral in-depth assessment of IDPs to guide&#13;
recovery programs. The main sectors covered will include livelihoods, water &amp; sanitation, infrastructure&#13;
as well as intentions and conditions to return. Basic information about education, employment and&#13;
general health variables will also be collected. These variables will help to create a general profile of&#13;
IDPs to understand their specific needs and how to address them, especially in the medium-term.&#13;
&#13;
Joint WBG-UNHCR Regional Assessment of Social, Economic &amp; Environmental Impact of&#13;
Forced Displacement in the Lake Chad Basin&#13;
As mentioned above, GPFD has provided support to conduct a joint WBG-UNHCR pre-assessment&#13;
mission with the objective of designing and scoping a regional assessment to analyze the development&#13;
dimensions of forced displacement in the LCB, including: the extent, causes, character and social and&#13;
economic impact of forced displacement in Nigeria and other adjacent countries of the LCB (Niger,&#13;
Chad and Cameroon, and possibly CAR). Subsequent to this mission, the UNHCR and WBG teams&#13;
have agreed to carry out a joint Regional Assessment of the Social, Economic &amp; Environmental Impact&#13;
of Forced Displacement in the LCB aligned with the scope proposed in the mission report. This&#13;
assessment will analyze the forced displacement and development nexus; assess the impacts of&#13;
refugees on hosting areas and communities; identify ongoing innovative interventions; and propose&#13;
entry points and practical operational recommendations. This work will inform dialogue between&#13;
national governments and development partners on effective national and regional initiatives,&#13;
institutional reforms and public policies that address the development dimensions of forced&#13;
displacement.&#13;
&#13;
Guidelines on Political Economy Analysis of Forced Displacement&#13;
In 2014, GPFD completed and published a set of guidelines on how to conduct PEA of forced&#13;
displacement.25 The note describes how and why to conduct PEA and illustrates how it can contribute to&#13;
understanding forced displacement crises with nine case studies: Casamance (Senegal), Colombia,&#13;
Cote dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire, DRC, Liberia, the Philippines, Somalia, South Sudan, and Zimbabwe.&#13;
&#13;
In this study, PEAs are presented as methods of informing policy dialogue and development operations&#13;
so that the interests of vulnerable forcibly displaced populations and their hosts are effectively&#13;
accommodated in resource allocation decision-making and in poverty alleviation initiatives. The key&#13;
elements of forced displacement PEAs include: (i) a review of the historical context and displacement&#13;

guided GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s country-specific and regional analytical work during the reporting period.&#13;
&#13;
Political Economy Analysis on Forced Displacement in MENA&#13;
GPFD has drafted a number of PEA on situations of forced displacement in MENA, at the country and&#13;
regional level. Thus far, GPFD has drafted and periodically updated these analyses for Libya, Turkey,&#13;
Iraq, Yemen, Jordan, Lebanon, Egypt, and the MENA region in general. These products typically&#13;
examine the legal and social context that displacement occurs within as well as the stakeholders&#13;
involved in each scenario (the actors, factors, and their interests) and the impacts of population&#13;
movements on host communities and governments in these countries and regions.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, in July 2015, GPFD inaugurated a two-phased exercise entitled â&#128;&#156;The Mashreq Population&#13;
Displacement Analysisâ&#128;&#157; that begins with the drafting of a knowledge product identifying and comparing&#13;
data on livelihoods and social stability impacts resulting from the Syrian refugee crisis in Iraq, Lebanon,&#13;
and Jordan. A second phase of activity is envisioned for the twelve months beginning in November&#13;
2015 that will conduct primary research on those factors that have merged as gaps in existing data or&#13;
require updating and monitoring to ensure the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s understandings of livelihood and social stability&#13;
impacts arising from the regional crisis are current.&#13;
&#13;
GPFD is also a regular contributor to ongoing reassessment of strategic direction in Yemen. Every four&#13;
weeks, GPFD provides updated forced displacement profiles for Yemen that detail the scope and&#13;
direction of movements, price data, and basic service delivery deficits in key locations based on key&#13;
informant data made available to GPFD.&#13;

&amp;#12;Sustainable Refugee Return&#13;
Among the most important thematic analytical pieces commissioned by GPFD during the past 18 months is a report&#13;
on the â&#128;&#156;Sustainable Refugee Return: Triggers, constraints, and lessons on addressing the development challenges of&#13;
forced displacementâ&#128;&#157;. The objective of this piece is to identify key conditions that influence the decisions by refugees in&#13;
protracted displacement regarding return to their home country or other coping strategies, and how these are affected&#13;
both by life in exile and by the situation in the country of origin. Based on a desk study of the existing literature and&#13;
eight country case studies, the report examines various displacement and return situations along with the role of&#13;
international assistance (including that provided by the WBG) to identify good practice examples and draw general&#13;
lessons that can be used to inform both WBG planning and advice to client governments, and the wider community of&#13;
development and humanitarian actors together with the governments of refugee origin and refugee hosting countries.&#13;
&#13;
Preliminary findings of this work show that access to livelihood assets, such as land, financial resources and social&#13;
networks in the country of origin, together with the prospects for recovering these assets, is a key factor that influences&#13;
and facilitates refugee households in their decisions to return, even where they appear to be integrated in the host&#13;
country, and even where the overall security and developmental conditions in the country of return are far from&#13;
optimal. The analysis also suggests that the extent to which life in exile provides space to pursue livelihoods and build&#13;
up assets is significant for the ability to reintegrate and re-establish livelihoods for those who choose to return.&#13;
Conversely, the record of assistance to returning refugees is very uneven and generally has been inadequate to&#13;
support sustainable reintegration of returnees. The findings of the analysis also suggests that the international&#13;
communityâ&#128;&#153;s current paradigm of â&#128;&#152;durable solutionsâ&#128;&#153; â&#128;&#147; voluntary return, local integration in the host country, or&#13;
resettlement to a third country â&#128;&#147; is too limited to capture the complexities and dynamics of refugee decision making&#13;
and coping strategies since it rests on the idea that â&#128;&#152;durable solutionsâ&#128;&#153; are found when movements stop, that they are&#13;
a finite event. The voluntary return model underplays the fact that refugees are purposive actors who respond to&#13;
circumstances in their exile and country of origin through strategies that can include either returning, staying in exile, or&#13;
a temporary or permanent combination of the two involving staggered or cyclical return, or temporary or permanent&#13;
dispersal of family members between exile and return locations to maximize access to livelihoods, services or other&#13;
priorities for family wellbeing. These complexities and the fluidity of displacement and return is something that both the&#13;
international aid community and the governments of refugee hosting and origin countries need to recognize in their&#13;
strategies to address displacement and return and promote â&#128;&#152;durable solutionsâ&#128;&#153;. This report is expected to be&#13;
completed and disseminated during FY16.&#13;
&#13;
Africa Forced Displacement Report and Portfolio Review&#13;
The objective of this work is to improve responses to the development challenges associated with forced displacement&#13;
in Africa by: (i) informing the regional and country assistance strategies of the WBG and other development partners; (ii)&#13;
influencing the policies and programs of client governments; and (iii) improving the relevance and effectiveness of WBG&#13;
operations in displacement-affected settings. The first phase of this work, which is now complete, summarizes the&#13;
demographics of forced displacement in AFR, legal and policy frameworks, and development challenges posed by&#13;
displacement. It also includes a detailed review of the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s country strategies and operational portfolio to distill&#13;
lessons learned. The second phase of this work is envisaged as part of the flagship for AFR and MENA, mentioned&#13;
above, to be undertaken in collaboration with the Chief Economists for the two regions.&#13;
&#13;
Forced Displacement and the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s Twin Goals&#13;
Following the commitment of the WBG to the Twin Goals of ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity,&#13;
GPFD set out the imperatives for addressing the development impacts of forced displacement to achieve these&#13;
goals. The articulation of these arguments supported GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s advocacy within the WBG to ensure that&#13;
analytical work and operations recognize that: (i) displaced people who are poor also have unique&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                              51&#13;
&amp;#12;vulnerabilities that are impediments to achieving higher incomes; (ii) eliminating extreme poverty requires a&#13;
strong and sustained focus on the particular development challenges in fragile and conflict-affected settings,&#13;
including the significant impacts of forced displacement on the poor; (iii) efforts are required to mitigate the&#13;
impact of conflict shocks by supporting the restoration of livelihoods and economic opportunities for both those&#13;
displaced by conflict and their hosts; (iv) a healthy social contract should enable displaced people to contribute&#13;
to their fullest potential by removing impediments to their participation in the economic, social, and political life&#13;
of their host communities; (v) efforts are required to understand and address the dynamics of protracted&#13;
displacement and its implications for vulnerability, exclusion and increased poverty levels; (vi) the potential&#13;
contribution of displaced people to improved economic growth and poverty reduction should be recognized and&#13;
facilitated; and (vii) sustainability of any progress towards the Twin Goals rests, among other things, on the&#13;
voice and empowerment of all sub-national population groups, including IDPs, refugees, returnees and host&#13;
communities.&#13;
&#13;
Urban Displacement&#13;
Recognizing that an increasing number of displaced persons worldwide now live in urban settings, GPFD has&#13;
made urban displacement a key thematic priority. This work stream aims to: (i) promote the mainstreaming of&#13;
forced displacement into the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s urban sector; and (ii) improve the effectiveness of operational responses&#13;
to displacement in urban environments. Analytical work conducted by the program has presented statistics on&#13;
the urbanization of forced displacement, identified the opportunities and challenges posed by urban&#13;
displacement, described the specific vulnerabilities of the urban displaced, identified the key constraints on&#13;
addressing displacement in urban areas, and proposed strategies for addressing the long-term development&#13;
impacts of forced displacement in urban areas. This work has also set out the next steps for TTLs, including a&#13;
detailed checklist, to integrate displacement into their policy dialogue with Government counterparts, and to&#13;
mainstream displacement into analytical and operational work. To disseminate and validate this work, GPFD&#13;
brought together a group of senior urban TTLs in the WBG in 2015 responsible for active or pipeline operations&#13;
that deal with displacement in urban environments - including Jordan, South Sudan, Lebanon, Georgia and&#13;
Azerbaijan - and to facilitate interactions between TTLs on their experiences (see knowledge section below).&#13;
&#13;
Gender in the Great Lakes&#13;
In collaboration with the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s Learning on Gender in Conflict and Africa (LOGiCA) Program, GPFD has&#13;
authored a study focused on the gender aspects of forced displacement across the Great Lakes Region. This&#13;
study aims to provide: (i) an analysis of the gender aspects of forced displacement in the region; and (ii)&#13;
operational recommendations going forward on approaches to integrate gender in development responses to&#13;
displacement in the region. It also deals with the inclusion of male gender issues, particularly those pertaining&#13;
to male youth at-risk, as well as SGBV in the displacement context. During the reporting period, the study team&#13;
carried out field studies and focus group discussion in Burundi, DRC and Uganda. The study team, based on&#13;
the field research, prepared country-specific reports. In April 2014, a workshop was organized which brought&#13;
the team members from the three countries to prepare the final report. The draft final report of the study has&#13;
been prepared and shared with LoGiCA.&#13;

4. PARTNERSHIPS&#13;
Partnership is a key element of the work of GPFD and facilitates the achievement of GPFD/WBG objectives.&#13;
Over the last year and a half, GPFD has focused significant attention on further strengthening internal and&#13;
external partnerships following the MTR in 2013. The aim of this work has been to develop collaborative and&#13;
complementary approaches to addressing the development challenges of conflict induced forced displacement&#13;
amongst humanitarian and development partners; strengthen the dialogue on policy options with governments,&#13;
regional organizations, NGOs and internationally; identify the best operational responses to address the&#13;
development needs of the displaced and affected host and return communities; and secure the essential&#13;
internal and external financing for GPFD.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
External Partnerships&#13;
Affected Governments&#13;
GPFD, with WBG country teams, is committed to working closely with affected governments to include&#13;
displacement considerations in national development planning and programs. Over the reporting period, GPFD&#13;
invited the Ugandan Refugee Commissioner to speak at the WBG FCV Forum during a session on UNHCRâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                    53&#13;
&amp;#12;Alternatives to Camps policy to share the Uganda experience more widely. In Jordan, GPFD has worked&#13;
closely with the Government to develop a comprehensive response to the refugee crisis through the&#13;
development of the JESSRP. Government representatives from affected countries were present at the latest&#13;
GPFD annual meeting. GPFD is now exploring options to work more closely with the G7+ and OECD&#13;
International Dialogue to ensure that the voice of affected countries on the issue of forced displacement is&#13;
represented in international fora.&#13;
&#13;
Bilateral Partners&#13;
GPFD has maintained strong and productive working partnerships with bilateral agencies focused on&#13;
addressing the development dimensions of forced displacement and finding solutions to the growing and&#13;
protracted nature of displacement crises. Financial support to GPFD provided by its key partners, including&#13;
Switzerland, Denmark and Norway has been essential in enabling GPFD to focus on the objectives of the&#13;
program and push the boundaries of forced displacement work within and outside the WBG. The power and&#13;
value of these strategic partnerships is evidenced in the ongoing discussions and consultations on approaches&#13;
and solutions held during the year with Denmark, Norway, Switzerland, the Netherlands, Canada, Sweden, the&#13;
US State Department, USAID, BMZ, Turkey and DFID.&#13;
&#13;
GPFD has worked with the Government of Germany on the development of a new policy on forced&#13;
displacement and will collaborate on key pieces of analytical work to shape future implementation investments.&#13;
GPFD and WBG teams have worked with the Canadian Government on the implementation of the JESSRP&#13;
project in Jordan that aims to mitigate the impacts of the Syrian crisis. Staff from GPFD visited the Netherlands&#13;
for consultations with the Government as it develops its response to forced displacement and work on the&#13;
Regional Development and Protection Program (RDPP) in the Horn of Africa. GPFD was able to share its&#13;
knowledge and expertise from the WBG Horn regional initiative. GPFD participated in the WBG strategic&#13;
consultations with the Government of Switzerland in 2015 during which displacement was identified as a key&#13;
development priority. GPFD continues to work with them on the Sahel, Great Lakes and Horn regions of Africa,&#13;
Syria, Colombia and Ukraine. GPFD has worked closely with the Governments of Denmark and Norway on the&#13;
design of the Solutions Alliance and to strengthen collaboration on strategic approaches in AFR and MENA.&#13;
GPFD has established a working partnership with the Government of Turkey as a new member of the Solutions&#13;
Alliance and Host of the WHS. During the year GPFD held consultations with DFID to strengthen collaboration&#13;
on analytical and operational work in Africa and MENA and in the run up to the WHS.&#13;
&#13;
GPFD has invested significant time over the past year to work with bilateral agencies on joint analytical work.&#13;
For example, GPFD worked closely with Norway on the Sahel and Horn of Africa studies and with DFID on a&#13;
joint study on protracted displacement.&#13;
&#13;
Regional Institutions&#13;
During the past year, GPFD has expanded its partnership base to improve collaboration with regional&#13;
institutions through the three regional initiatives in Africa. GPFD has worked closely with the EU on the&#13;
development of the EU policy on displacement and visited Brussels in June for consultations on the challenges&#13;
of displacement and implications for the European migration crisis. The New European Agenda for Migration,&#13;
agreed in May 2015, sets out the new policy for the EU and contains important references to the development&#13;
dimensions of both displacement and migration. GPFD will continue to work closely with DEVCO on the&#13;
RDPPs in the Horn, North Africa and the Middle East. Finally, GPFD has continued its collaboration with the&#13;
African Union (AU) on the Kampala Convention, with SADC on the Great Lakes Operation for Regional&#13;
Cooperation and Capacity Building and with ECOWAS on their regional strategy for security and development&#13;
in the Sahel.&#13;

&amp;#12;UNHCR and other UN Agencies&#13;
Over the past year and a half, GPFD has intensified its collaboration with UNHCR on joint analytical and&#13;
operational work in the Great Lakes, Sahel, Horn, and LCB regions of Africa, as well as on the Syria crisis.&#13;
Financial support from UNCHR has been instrumental in facilitating this cooperation. This has ensured a&#13;
greater focus on the importance of addressing the development challenges of forced displacement within both&#13;
institutions and is reflected, for example, in the new UNHCR policy on â&#128;&#152;Alternatives to Campsâ&#128;&#153;, as well as in the&#13;
WBGâ&#128;&#153;s operational work. The partnership with UNHCR has been given renewed attention with the&#13;
establishment of a regular high level strategic dialogue between the UN High Commissioner and WBG&#13;
President. The purpose of this dialogue is to further strengthen the partnership on displacement and identify the&#13;
priorities to guide future joint analytical, policy and operational work. GPFD and UNHCR teams recently met in&#13;
Geneva to take forward their vision for greater strategic and operational collaboration and to explore better&#13;
ways to support affected Governments to incorporate a development approach to forced displacement in&#13;
national development policies and plans. UNHCR will work closely with the WBG on the proposed flagship on&#13;
forced displacement and development. In relation to this, a series of thematic events with practitioners from&#13;
both organizations is being prepared to facilitate more effective knowledge exchange on key development&#13;
issues and to agree areas for further analytical work.&#13;
&#13;
The WBG/GPFD has actively participated in discussions with UNHCR and other UN agencies, including UNDP,&#13;
to promote the issue of forced displacement in the post-2015 debate and the SDGs, particularly Goal 1626. The&#13;
development aspects of forced displacement should thus be reflected in the 2016 WHS outcome document.&#13;
GPFD was represented at the Geneva ECOSOC in June 2015, organized by EU and IDMC, as well as the UN&#13;
Special Rapporteur on IDPs. GPFD also participated in the OCHA-organized seminar, â&#128;&#156;Coherence in Conflictâ&#128;&#157;&#13;
in June 2015 in Copenhagen, which explored ways to strengthen the complementarity of humanitarian and&#13;
development assistance to fragile and conflict-affected countries.&#13;
&#13;
The Solutions Alliance&#13;
Many of GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s bilateral partners were actively involved in the establishment of the Solutions Alliance in&#13;
Copenhagen in April 2014 as a coalition of humanitarian actors, development organizations, affected states,&#13;
donor nations, academics, the private sector, civil society and other actors. The Solutions Alliance is chaired by&#13;
UNHCR, UNDP, IRC and the Danish and Turkish Governments, and is working to promote and enable the&#13;
transition for displaced persons away from dependency towards increased resilience, self-reliance and&#13;
development. In particular, the Solutions Alliance aims to: (i) support innovative solutions and concrete&#13;
operations in selected displacement situations; (ii) help shape the global policy agenda, including the post-2015&#13;
development agenda and the New Deal process, to recognize displacement as a development challenge as&#13;
well as a humanitarian and protection issue; and (iii) ensure that a diverse and growing group of partners form&#13;
a vibrant network and maximize the impact of their individual efforts.&#13;
&#13;
The Solutions Alliance is now actively pursuing a global advocacy strategy that will support strategic planning&#13;
by affected states to address the specific legal, economic, social and political issues relevant to achieving&#13;
solutions. GPFD contributed to the design of the Solutions Alliance and is part of its data sharing working group&#13;
and its Somalia chapter (see below). GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s work with the Solutions Alliance has established a strong platform&#13;
for an exchange of views and sharing of lessons on the development aspects of forced displacement and&#13;
facilitates country and global level policy dialogue and joint actions.&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                                55&#13;
&amp;#12;The Solutions Alliance Somalia&#13;
The Solution Alliance Somalia (SAS) is a Kenya-based forum for data analysis and exchange of information, as&#13;
well as creating a joint vision to address Somali displacement within the region. The members of the SAS&#13;
include: The WBG, UNHCR, the Danish Embassy (Danida), as well as the Regional Durable Solutions&#13;
Secretariat (RDSS), which includes DRC, IRC, and other NGOs working on Somali displacement.&#13;
&#13;
One of the first deliverables of SAS is a regional durable solutions framework that will facilitate the collaboration&#13;
between the various organizations working on Somali displacement. The framework takes its starting point in&#13;
already existing frameworks, including the IASC framework on durable solutions for IDPs. A team led by IRC&#13;
and DRC has been working on developing the first draft of the Framework. In addition to tailoring the ISAC&#13;
indicators to fit the current context in Somalia, the team has been documenting the progress made by various&#13;
organizations to address durable solutions needs of the displaced in order to set the baseline to measure future&#13;
progress. In March 2015, GPFD co-organized the first SAS technical workshop that brought together technical&#13;
staff from the various member organizations of the SAS to develop the durable solutions results framework.&#13;
GPFD is working closely with members of the SAS to finalize the development of the results framework. In July&#13;
2015, GPFD made a brief presentation on the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s involvement in the Solutions Alliance-Somalia at the&#13;
2015 UNHCR Annual Consultations with NGOs. GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s presentation highlighted the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s displacement-&#13;
related activities in Somalia and the role of the SAS.&#13;
&#13;
NGOs&#13;
GPFD has strengthened relationships with NGO partners, such as Save the Children, International Rescue&#13;
Committee (IRC), and Search for Common Ground, so as to benefit from these agenciesâ&#128;&#153; specific sector&#13;
expertise and close contact with affected people in order to move forward the global debate. GPFD has also&#13;
spearheaded the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s collaboration with IRC on forced displacement, particularly by providing support to the&#13;
meetings of the WBG President and the President of the IRC in 2015, where they committed to working more&#13;
closely on mitigating the impacts of forced displacement in the run up to the WHS.GPFD and Danish Refugee&#13;
Council (DRC) have worked closely for several years on issues such as livelihoods, human terrain and the&#13;
Syria crisis. GPFD also partners with the Norwegian Refugee Council (NRC) on strategic matters and has done&#13;
joint analytical work on land issues for the displaced in Cote dâ&#128;&#153;Ivoire and Casamance.&#13;
&#13;
Research Institutions&#13;
Over several years, GPFD worked closely with the Refugee Study Centre (RSC) at Oxford University on the&#13;
development of a methodology for economic and social impact assessments, as well as a paper on sustainable&#13;
refugee return. GPFD recently participated in the Humanitarian Innovation Conference at Oxford. The ongoing&#13;
collaboration with the Joint IDP Profiling Service (JIPS) is exploring how profiling of displaced populations can&#13;
be useful to development planning. Current collaboration with the independent research organization REACH&#13;
leverages that groupâ&#128;&#153;s regional presence, relationships, and expertise in collecting data on forced displacement&#13;
issues in MENA. GPFD participated in a workshop organized by RefugePoint on solutions to forced&#13;
displacement, held in Massachusetts in April 2015. Finally, collaboration with the Nansen Initiative is examining&#13;
the role of analytics and data gathering for the development of a protection agenda for those displaced&#13;
because of natural hazards and climate change.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;Internal Partnerships&#13;
As discussed above GPFD is now housed in the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s FCV Group and is able to ensure that the&#13;
displacement challenge is reflected in the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s core work on fragility and conflict. Within the WBG, GPFD&#13;
has developed relationships with other CCSAs, for example on jobs and gender, as well as the GPs (GP&#13;
SURR, Social Protection, Governance and Poverty) to further strengthen WBG work on forced displacement.&#13;
&#13;
KNOMAD&#13;
GPFD continues to work closely with the Global Knowledge Partnership on Migration and Development&#13;
(KNOMAD), a global hub of knowledge and policy expertise on migration and development issues, which&#13;
during the reporting period created a new Thematic Working Group (TWG) on Forced Migration, in 2014, and&#13;
nominated GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s Manager, Niels Harild, as its Co-Chair, together with UNHCRâ&#128;&#153;s Deputy High Commissioner,&#13;
Alexander Aleinikoff. An expert workshop in September 2014 identified the most important knowledge gaps on&#13;
the development impacts of forced migration and related policy issues and helped shape the work program of&#13;
the TWG. Based on the workshop results, the TWG will work on questions related to the socio-economic&#13;
impacts of forced migration (compared to economic migration), self-reliance of refugees and IDPs, personal&#13;
transfers to and from refugees and IDPs, public perceptions, the political economy in host countries, and return&#13;
to countries and communities of origin. The objective of the TWG is to develop evidence-based policy options&#13;
for protracted situations. In its first year, the TWG focused on the impact of displaced populations on urban&#13;
areas, personal transfers sent to and from refugees and IDPs, and an assessment of refugees' right to work.&#13;
&#13;
Internal Evaluation Group (IEG)&#13;
IEGâ&#128;&#153;s forthcoming â&#128;&#156;Evaluation of World Bank Group Activities in Situations of Conflict and Violenceâ&#128;&#157; benefited&#13;
from consultations with GPFD at its conception stage. The evaluation aims to assess and report on the quality&#13;
and results of WBG programs and operations planned and implemented under situations affected by localized&#13;
conflict and violence. Since there is no comprehensive list of countries faced with localized conflict and&#13;
violence, GPFD was part of consultations to help the evaluation team select the potential case studies and to&#13;
ensure that the issue of IDPs and refugees across national borders is properly recognized and discussed in the&#13;
evaluation.&#13;
&#13;
One of the focus areas of the evaluation is how the WBG and the UN collaborate in situations of localized&#13;
conflict and violence. The program shared its unique experience of forging strong partnership between the&#13;
WBG and UN and other partners to deliver development responses to situations of crisis and protracted&#13;
displacement, ranging from strategic collaboration to country level engagement.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;5. KNOWLEDGE, TRAINING &amp; COMMUNICATION&#13;
Given the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s commitment to addressing the challenge of FCV, and the urgency of delivering development&#13;
solutions to respond to forced displacement, GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s role in promoting knowledge sharing on operational&#13;
approaches and lessons learned has grown significantly. Based on the results that the program has achieved&#13;
over the past few years, the team has developed a proactive knowledge management plan, which emphasizes&#13;
effective, regular dissemination of analytical and operational achievements. GPFD has also organized several&#13;
high profile events during the past 18 months, including the â&#128;&#156;Alternatives to Campsâ&#128;&#157; discussion during the WBG&#13;
FCV Forum; an event with the Brookings Institution on the Great Lakes displacement report; and contributed to&#13;
a â&#128;&#156;Solutions CafÃ©â&#128;&#157; brainstorming session at the WBG 2015 Spring Meetings. GPFD also launched a new&#13;
website in June 2015, which will serve as a key platform to share analytical work with bilateral partners and to&#13;
communicate effectively with those outside of the WBG. The GPFD knowledge management plan also includes&#13;
a series of workshops, to be conducted for WBG task team leaders working on forced displacement. GPFD is&#13;
establishing a new Community of Practice (CoP) on the issue, building on new communication platforms&#13;
available to the team. To fulfill the expectations of its partners and meet the institutional needs of the WBG,&#13;
GPFD hired a dedicated consultant to craft a knowledge management plan. This plan answered key questions&#13;
about strategy, technology, processes, and people. Based on priorities for the program, GPFD identified three&#13;
broad categories of work: (i) training; (ii) communications; and (iii) dissemination. Progress made in each of&#13;
these areas is listed below.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Training&#13;
Forced Displacement Training&#13;
Towards the end of the reporting period, GPFD held the first of what it expects to become a series of forced&#13;
displacement trainings within the WBG. This two-day training supported senior-level TTLs working on&#13;
operations that respond to development challenges posed by forced displacement and included modules on: (i)&#13;
a toolbox for TTLs; (ii) guidance on how to respond to the development and political challenges or forced&#13;
displacement; (iii) discussion on the balance between vulnerability and resilience and costs and benefits; (iv)&#13;
presentations of case studies and WBG experience; (v) a peer-to-peer clinic; and (vi) networking and&#13;
community-building between TTLs.&#13;
&#13;
32 senior staff attended the training, including a mix of Senior Social Development, Public Sector, Rural&#13;
Development, Urban, Operations, Economist, Country Economist, and Social Protection Specialists. Major&#13;
outcomes of the training were: (i) demand for spin-off sector and geography-specific trainings; (ii)&#13;
overwhelmingly positive feedback, with constructive comments on areas to enhance, such as requests for&#13;
longer trainings with step-by-step operationalization tools; (iii) the creation of a draft CoP design, which was&#13;
created on-site, with participants. This training was registered on the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s Learning Management System&#13;
(LMS), enabling participants to receive credit for the course.&#13;
&#13;
GPFD is in the process of developing a list of indicators for use in the planning of operations on forced&#13;
displacement. The preliminary list is being piloted in the preparation of the regional IDA project on forced&#13;
displacement in the Great Lakes, as well as in the regional MENA work on SIRI. Various TTLs have deemed&#13;
this list useful in the development of results frameworks and analytical work, and the program will continue to&#13;
further develop this list.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      58&#13;
&amp;#12;Core Course Displacement Modules&#13;
The core course is a regular training opportunity hosted by the FCV group for WBG staff as well as key external&#13;
participants. The FCV CCSA presents a number of modules, and has recently included a dedicated module on&#13;
forced displacement, developed by GPFD. This module provides participants with an overview of the&#13;
development challenges of forced displacement (at the sub-national, national and regional levels) and the&#13;
range of programming that has responded to the needs of the displaced and affected host communities. GPFD&#13;
presented the forced displacement modules at two core courses, one in March 2015 in Washington, DC, and a&#13;
second one in June 2015 in Istanbul, Turkey. The forced displacement module has been well received by&#13;
participants, as measured by high marks and positive participant responses in course evaluations.&#13;
&#13;
GSURR Workshop on Urbanization&#13;
As part of a series of TTL workshops, GPFD hosted a session within the WBG GSURR Learning Forum&#13;
entitled â&#128;&#156;Forced Displacement and Urbanizationâ&#128;&#157;. This session provided a real-time exchange among TTLs on&#13;
design features of developed or ongoing operations in urban areas with significant forced displacement.&#13;
Projects in the following countries were discussed: Lebanon, Jordan, South Sudan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and&#13;
Afghanistan. Following a brief introduction of each programâ&#128;&#153;s objectives, the TTLs exchanged views on&#13;
challenges, achievements, and opportunities. Two draft documents were presented and discussed at the event,&#13;
namely: (i) the urban TTL checklist; and (ii) the note on urban forced displacement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Communications&#13;
GPFD Website&#13;
Responding to a call from bilateral&#13;
partners for an improved and easily&#13;
accessible GPFD website at the&#13;
annual meeting in February 2014,&#13;
the program has made significant&#13;
efforts to launch a new website&#13;
before the end of the reporting&#13;
period. This goal was achieved,&#13;
when the new website was launched&#13;
on June 9, 2015. The site is&#13;
integrated into the mainframe of the&#13;
WBG, linked to its location in the&#13;
CCSA on FCV, and is available at:&#13;
www.worldbank.org/forceddisplacem&#13;
ent. The purpose of the site is to be&#13;
the online focal point for the WBG's work on Forced Displacement, a global issue that is a priority for the&#13;
Fragility, Conflict, and Violence CCSA. In addition, the website will clearly and transparently present program&#13;
knowledge and information to partners engaged with the program, country client governments, donors, WBG&#13;
staff, and the general public. The website is organized according to the four work streams of the program,&#13;
namely: operational support, analytical work, partnerships, and knowledge. The website will also function as&#13;
the main avenue for dissemination of the program's analytical and operational work.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                       59&#13;
&amp;#12;Community of Practice&#13;
Following discussions on how best to mainstream the forced displacement agenda in the WBG, GPFD is in the&#13;
process of establishing a CoP which will be consolidated and expanded in the coming fiscal year. This idea&#13;
grew from the forced displacement training, as well as TTLs and managers across the WBG, who are calling&#13;
for a mechanism to remain engaged with GPFD and share lessons learned. The ideas evolved during a&#13;
brainstorming session on topics, tools, and methods undertaken during the training for WBG staff. GPFD will&#13;
consider developing a regular newsletter as a priority for the CoP.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Dissemination&#13;
GPFD hosted several public events in the past year and a half to disseminate analytical and operational work.&#13;
The Urban Forced Displacement Note and TTL Checklist were disseminated internally through the GSURR&#13;
Forum mentioned above. GPFD also created audio recordings and packets of materials for a number of events&#13;
and disseminated those materials to participants and attendees, as well as wider staff. Important dissemination&#13;
events are below.&#13;
&#13;
FCV Forum&#13;
The WBG FCV Forum is a yearly forum&#13;
that highlights the work of the FCV&#13;
CCSA and its partners. On February 11,&#13;
2015, GPFD hosted a two-session panel&#13;
called â&#128;&#156;Alternatives to Campsâ&#128;&#157;, the&#13;
purpose of which was to: (i) profile the&#13;
new UNHCR policy on â&#128;&#156;Alternatives to&#13;
Campsâ&#128;&#157;;      (ii) highlight  Ugandaâ&#128;&#153;s&#13;
experience and the work of GPFD in&#13;
establishing development responses to&#13;
forced displacement; and (iii) examine&#13;
WBG        experience   in     providing&#13;
alternatives in Turkey and Azerbaijan.           Zeynep Dandelier and Ximena Del Carpio&#13;
Panelists were Niels Harild, Manager of          present their work on forced displacement in&#13;
GPFD, Steven Corliss, Director of the            Turkey at the GPFD session â&#128;&#156;Alternatives to&#13;
Division of Program Support and                  Campsâ&#128;&#157;, during the Fragility, Conflict, and&#13;
Management, UNHCR, and Apollo                    Violence Forum.&#13;

study presentations on Turkey and&#13;
Azerbaijan from the WBG and implementing partners. More than 80 people attended from both inside and&#13;
outside the WBG.&#13;
&#13;
In addition, GPFD supported a two-session panel in the FCV Forum, entitled: â&#128;&#156;Enhancing World Bank&#13;
Engagement in MENA in a Context of Regional Transformation, Conflict and Uncertaintyâ&#128;&#157;. In the first of the&#13;
MENA-focused sessions, panelists, including GPFD Manager, examined the Arab worldâ&#128;&#153;s shifting political&#13;
landscape, the regionâ&#128;&#153;s drivers of transition and conflict, its impacts and the challenges/opportunities for longer-&#13;
term stability and development. The second session focused on the rise of sectarian divisions and ethnic&#13;
conflicts, recognizing the impact of these trends on the transition process and on the regionâ&#128;&#153;s stability. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                        60&#13;
&amp;#12;session also examined some of the strategies the WBG and other development institutions could pursue in&#13;
supporting transitional governance and institutional and social resilience against external shocks and sectarian&#13;
violence.&#13;
&#13;
Inclusive and Sustainable Cities Event&#13;
On March 2, 2015, GPFD manager Niels Harild presented a TED-style talk on â&#128;&#156;Forced Displacement and the Urban&#13;
Sectorâ&#128;&#157; at the Plenary Session of the three-day Inclusive and Sustainable Cities event, hosted by GSURR. The event&#13;
reflected the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s newly defined multi-dimensional approach to promote inclusive cities. The new approach calls for&#13;
higher attention to inclusion in urban areas and it recognizes the need to move away from single-sector - â&#128;&#152;brick and&#13;
mortarâ&#128;&#153; interventions to a multi-dimensional strategy that encompasses spatial, social and economic aspects. The talk,&#13;
focused on the message that urban displacement is increasingly being recognized as a long-term development issue.&#13;
The presentation highlighted the issues of displacement in an urban context including exclusion and vulnerabilities&#13;
faced     by     displaced&#13;
population in urban areas.&#13;
He also discussed the key&#13;
challenges and approaches&#13;
to address these issues&#13;
were also discussed.&#13;

share solutions to clientsâ&#128;&#153; most pressing and complex challenges. Among several high-profile discussions,&#13;
GPFD supported the FCV session titled â&#128;&#156;How Can We Turn Displacement into an Opportunity to Build&#13;
Resilience and Stability?â&#128;&#157; Held in the WBG, the session gathered practitioners from around the world. Led by&#13;
Betty Bigombe, Sr. Director of the FCV CCSA, Ferid Belhaj, Country Director for the Middle East region, and&#13;
Ede Jorge Ijjasz-Vasquez, Sr. Director of GSURR, the session highlighted the need for in-depth exchanges&#13;
between teams who are working on forced displacement in the same regions. Solutions CafÃ© sessions were&#13;
recorded and made available to participants after the event.&#13;
&#13;
Great Lakes Report Dissemination and Collaboration with Brookings&#13;
On April 21, 2015 the Brookings-LSE Project on Internal Displacement and GPFD hosted a talk at Brookings&#13;
on assistance and protection conditions for refugees, IDPs, returnees, and host communities in the Great&#13;
Lakes. Speakers Stacey White, author of the Brookings-LSE Project on Internal Displacement report â&#128;&#156;Now&#13;
What? The International Response to Internal Displacement in the Democratic Republic of the Congo,â&#128;&#157; as well&#13;

&amp;#12;de Berry and Cordelia Chesnutt, examined how to pursue a development response to forced displacement&#13;
within existing regional political frameworks, processes, and bodies such as the AU, and the UN Special Envoy&#13;
for the Great Lakes region. Attended by over 80 audience members, Elizabeth Ferris, senior fellow and co-&#13;
director of the Brookings-LSE Project on Internal Displacement, moderated the event and an interactive Q&amp;A&#13;
after speakersâ&#128;&#153; comments. Audio and transcript of this session are available on the Brookings IDP-LSE Project&#13;
on Internal Displacement website. The GPFD report was subsequently translated and printed in French and&#13;
disseminated to local authorities in DRC, in both Goma and Kinshasa. This event was one among a series of&#13;
knowledge events in which GPFD and Brookings worked together to highlight the development dimensions of&#13;
forced displacement. Niels Harild participated in the event, â&#128;&#156;Internal Displacement: Lessons Learned after 20&#13;
years and challenges aheadâ&#128;&#157;,27 which marked the culmination of Brookingsâ&#128;&#153; work on this topic.&#13;

6. IMPACTS AND RESULTS&#13;
The purpose of this section is to provide an overview of GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s impacts and results. The main objective of&#13;
GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s work is to achieve positive changes for vulnerable displaced populations and their host communities,&#13;
which often requires a shift in government policy. GPFD acts as a catalyst, encouraging policy dialogue and&#13;
operational change with WBG project teams and client governments. The full impact of GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s work will be&#13;
evident once large-scale impact evaluations are conducted of the development projects GPFD has influenced.&#13;
In the interim, the programâ&#128;&#153;s results thus far are discussed below.&#13;
&#13;
The results chain above (figure 10) shows the different levels of work GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s work. GPFD focuses on four key&#13;
results areas: analytical work, operational support, partnerships, and knowledge, in order to influence CMUs,&#13;
TTLs, GPs and CCSAs. However, GPFD does not operate in a vacuum. The program continually engages with&#13;
partners within and outside the WBG. This affects its modus operandi by bringing shared experiences and&#13;
lessons learned and vice versa through regular interaction. Therefore, judging the impacts and results of&#13;
GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s work is most accurately be done at the meta-level, by determining to what extent the program has&#13;
managed to influence the design of WBG projects or influence policy change with Governments. The 2013&#13;
MTR was the first step in assessing the programâ&#128;&#153;s impact.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
MTR Findings&#13;
It found GPFD to be on track in meeting its dual objectives of raising WBG awareness of the development impacts of&#13;
displacement and in improving the WBG's contribution to an enhanced development response. The MTR gave a&#13;
positive review of the Analytical and Advisory Assistance (AAA) services and operational support provided to CMUs&#13;
and Sector teams working on countries impacted by forced displacement. The role of GPFD in contributing to the global&#13;
Solutions Alliance and debates on international policies on forced displacement and development was acknowledged.&#13;
The MTR was impressed by the positive achievements in relation to the WBG response to Syria crisis and the work&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                         63&#13;
&amp;#12;undertaken to support the AFR regional initiatives following the visits of the UN Secretary General and WBG President.&#13;
Given the growing international profile of forced displacement and the increased demand for GPFD services, the MTR&#13;
recommended a significant expansion of GPFD to assist the WBG to meet this demand.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Major Impacts of GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s Activities&#13;
One of GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s biggest achievements during the reporting period is the allocation of $250 million in regional IDA funds&#13;
to the Great Lakes and Horn of Africa for development operations to address forced displacement. GPFD has&#13;
successfully leveraged donor resources by: (i) supporting the drafting of the regional initiatives; (ii) leading&#13;
analytical work in partnership with UNHCR; (iii) mainstreaming recommendations from these studies to WBG&#13;
operations, and (iv) aiding the preparation of regional operations in the Great Lakes and the Horn.&#13;
&#13;
GPFD has provided multifaceted support to the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s analytical and operational work in MENA as a result of&#13;
the Syria crisis, and in the ECA region in relation to the Ukraine crisis. In MENA, this has influenced the&#13;
development of: (i) operations to address forced displacement in the region; (ii) the design of the new MENA&#13;
strategy, with a focus on forced displacement; and (iii) agreement between the Chief Economistsâ&#128;&#153; offices in&#13;
both the MENA and AFR regions on a major flagship AAA on the economics and operational elements of&#13;
forced displacement.&#13;
&#13;
Finally, GPFD has had significant impact at the policy level, as evidenced by the agreement by the WBG President and&#13;
UN High Commissioner for Refugees to have regular high-level consultations and to expand this partnership further.&#13;
Moving forward, GPFD will continue to promote forced displacement as a central issue in the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s engagement in&#13;
global policy dialogues, such as the WHS and the post-2015 debates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Geographical distribution&#13;
Globally, during the reporting period, GPFD has been active in 40 countries, shown in figure 11.&#13;

                                                          figures prominently (10%), due to longstanding&#13;
                                                          activities in Azerbaijan and Georgia, coupled with&#13;
                                                          crises in Turkey and Ukraine. GPFD has added&#13;
                                                          activities in EAP, engaging with country teams in&#13;

                                                          work on Afghanistan will ensure that GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s focus on&#13;
                                                          SAR will grow in the coming fiscal year, and the&#13;
                                                          program will remain committed to supporting colleagues&#13;

Policies on Forced Displacement&#13;
In its first few years, GPFD focused on awareness raising and positioning forced displacement in the analysis&#13;
and operations of the WBG and its partners. Building on the programâ&#128;&#153;s experience, and with increased support&#13;
from across the WBG, GPFD is now even better positioned to achieve its objective of influencing global,&#13;
regional and national development policies to better reflect the needs of displaced populations and their host&#13;
communities.&#13;
&#13;
In MENA, GPFD is supporting the Center for Mediterranean Integration (CMI) in Marseille in the planning and&#13;
development of a conference of high-level policymakers to address the Syrian refugee crisis in September&#13;
2015. Another example of GPFD engagement at the policy level was the programâ&#128;&#153;s contribution to a revised&#13;
ECOWAS strategy for security and development in the Sahel in 2013.&#13;
&#13;
The regional operations in the Great Lakes and the Horn of Africa are platforms for a more substantive policy-&#13;
dialogue on forced displacement at both national and regional level. In Ethiopia, the engagement with the&#13;
Government through the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s regional HOA initiative has inspired a different Government approach to the&#13;
refugee challenge in the country. The regional initiatives, and associated operations, are supporting a paradigm&#13;
shift amongst governments and regional institutions from seeing forced displacement as only a humanitarian&#13;
concern to an issue that has development, political, and security dimensions.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      65&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                  In Uganda, GPFD together with GSURR has worked closely with&#13;
                                                 the Government to showcase its progressive policies towards&#13;
                                                 hosting refugees. During the FCV Forum in February 2015, the&#13;
                                                 Ugandan Refugee Commissioner spoke at a panel organized by&#13;
                                                 GPFD to share experiences and lessons learned. In particular, the&#13;
                                                 protracted refugee presence in Uganda has led the Government&#13;
                                                 to move from a predominantly humanitarian response to&#13;
                                                 increasingly including forced displacement in national&#13;
                                                 development plans. This has allowed refugees to live in open&#13;
                                                 settlements and made it possible for refugees to take part in and&#13;
                                                 contribute to the local economy. The photo above demonstrates&#13;
                                                 the vision of the Office of the Prime Minister, Department of&#13;
                                                 Refugees, which seeks to empower refugees and host&#13;
                                                 communities with opportunities to live a better life.&#13;
&#13;
                                                 GPFD has also supported the Government of Sudan in&#13;
                                                 dealing with the political challenge of forced displacement.&#13;
                                                 Here, displacement is a major focus of the Interim Poverty&#13;
                                                 Reduction Strategy Paper (I-PRSP) and displacement is&#13;
                                                 among the Governmentâ&#128;&#153;s four key development priorities&#13;
                                                 alongside growth and employment, governance and human&#13;
                                                 resources. This priority is mirrored by the WBG engagement&#13;

for the second pillar is â&#128;&#156;supporting reintegration through area-based development approaches targeting&#13;
livelihood promotion and employment creation for displaced populations and host communitiesâ&#128;&#157;. GPFD&#13;
was closely involved with the drafting of these documents and helped ensure that forced displacement&#13;
was made a critical priority in the PRSP and ISN.&#13;

High Level WBG Attention&#13;
                                                                     One significant way in which high level&#13;

                                                                     President, Jim Y. Kim, has undertaken jointly&#13;
                                                                     with UN Secretary General, Ban-ki Moon, to&#13;

&amp;#12;opportunity for GPFD and UNHCR to jointly produce analytical work with recommendations that have&#13;
influenced the design of operations within the WBG. And in October 2014, the leaders visited the HOA,&#13;
including spending time in a refugee camp, highlighting the development challenges of displacement. These&#13;
joint visits have demonstrated the sense of political commitment to forced displacement, underlining the critical&#13;
role of the UN in the humanitarian field, while allowing the WBG to take up more of a role on the development&#13;
side.&#13;
&#13;
Another way in which senior WBG management have demonstrated their attention and commitment to the&#13;
issue was when the WBG President and UNHCR High Commissioner recently had a bilateral discussion of the&#13;
challenge of forced displacement. This discussion took place as a result of the joint efforts of GPFD and&#13;
UNHCR colleagues and reflected the recognition of both organizations that the issue requires a coordinated&#13;
humanitarian and development approach. It was agreed that moving forward, regular high level consultations&#13;
would be held to monitor progress on this important partnership. When the UN High Commissioner for&#13;
Refugees, Antonio Guterres, visited Kenya and Somalia in May 2015, he expressed the need to â&#128;&#152;improve&#13;
socio-economic conditions for the benefit of returning refugees and internally displaced Somalis, as well as&#13;
local communitiesâ&#128;&#153;.29 In May 2015, after her visit to the Great Lakes region, WBG Managing Director and Chief&#13;
Operating Officer Sri Mulyani Indrawati blogged about the WBG support of the Great Lakes Regional Initiative&#13;
and the development issues facing the forcibly displaced (see: â&#128;&#156;The Difference between Peace and Lasting&#13;
Peace is Regional Integrationâ&#128;&#157;, Annex 3).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Better dissemination and communication&#13;
A major achievement of the program during the reporting period has been the improved dissemination&#13;
and communication to partners of its analytical achievements. Following strong recommendations from its&#13;
partners at the annual GPFD meeting in Copenhagen in February 2014, GPFD has made a concerted effort in&#13;
this area, resulting most importantly in the launching of its website in June 2015. In addition, the program held a&#13;
series of high profile knowledge dissemination events within and outside of the WBG (see knowledge section).&#13;
Moving forward, GPFD will seek to further strengthen this area of its work to ensure the effective use of its&#13;
analytical and operational results.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Remaining Challenges&#13;
In spite of the explosive numbers of forcibly displaced persons worldwide and the increased high level attention&#13;
to the issue, challenges remain in achieving the paradigm shift from looking at forced displacement mainly as a&#13;
humanitarian concern to one that has both developmental, security, political and economic aspects. The&#13;
political sensitivity of forced displacement can still limit the willingness of policymakers to discuss the issue from&#13;
a development perspective, as this might signal an acceptance of long-term, protracted displacement.&#13;
Providing livelihood opportunities to refugees is particularly complex in countries faced with economic hardship.&#13;
GPFD uses the recommendations emanating from its analytical work, as well as global operational lessons&#13;
learned, as the basis for conversations with WBG country teams and external partners, to increase awareness&#13;
of both the negative and positive impacts of displacement.&#13;

&amp;#12;7. RESOURCE MANAGEMENT&#13;
During the first six years of GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s existence, donor contributions totaled $7,981,775, coming from Denmark&#13;
($4,166,414), Norway ($2,270,386), Switzerland ($1,144,975) and UNHCR ($400,000). In addition, GPFD&#13;
secured $ 1,763,338 in support from bank sources (trust funds and regular budget), bringing the total income of&#13;
the program to $ 9,745,113. Expenditure for the first six years, ending June 2015, totaled $ 7,925,171. The&#13;
remaining balance of some $ 1.8 million is allocated or earmarked for specific activities for FY16. This amount&#13;
is insufficient to cover existing and projected demand for the coming 3 years.&#13;
&#13;
GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s plan and budget are appropriately simple and flexible to facilitate ongoing prioritization in response to&#13;
shifting needs. The demand from WBG teams and external partners for support from the GPFD has continued&#13;
to increase as awareness of the program expands and as the global level of forced displacement increases. Its&#13;
lean structure and simple procedures makes it cost-effective. Assumptions about demand can only be&#13;
indicative as developments in situations of conflict and fragility are inherently unpredictable, and the demand&#13;
could become much higher if new situations of conflict and sub national fragility emerge or if opportunities arise&#13;
to address protracted displacement. As most of the existing forced displacement is protracted with extensive&#13;
development needs, the demand is likely to increase.&#13;
&#13;
The successes that GPFD has achieved so far is largely dependent on the financial and technical support of its&#13;
bilateral partners. While progress has been made in raising awareness of the issue and strengthening the WBG&#13;
contribution to an enhanced development response, there is still much more to do. A significant scale up of&#13;
financial and human resources is necessary for the GPFD to meet the growing demand by WBG country and&#13;
task teams for the provision of advice, and technical and analytical support in both protracted situations and in&#13;
newly emerging crises. The proposed scaled up GPFD work program for the next three years to meet the&#13;
increased demand from a growing number of countries globally affected by forced displacement and to deliver&#13;
on the program objectives and strategic priorities for FY16-18 is projected to be $12 million, requiring an&#13;
additional $10.5 million funding from internal and external sources. This would enable GPFD to maintain its&#13;
responsiveness, flexibility and reach and continue to provide high quality analytical and operational work.&#13;

8. MOVING FORWARD&#13;
Over the past six years, the WBG, through the GPFD, has been working to ensure that the development&#13;
dimensions of forced displacement are incorporated into WBG analysis, country and regional strategies, and&#13;
operations. It is clear that it will not be possible to achieve the WBG twin goals of ending extreme poverty and&#13;
promoting shared prosperity without the inclusion of displaced persons in the WBG core work particularly in&#13;
countries impacted by FCV. Moving forward, GPFD plans to significantly scale up its work program to meet&#13;
and address the growing demand for work on forced displacement across the WBG and internationally.&#13;
&#13;
The original GPFD objectives of increasing WBG awareness of the development impact of forced&#13;
displacement; and improving the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s contribution to an enhanced development response remain as&#13;
relevant as ever. Over the next three years, GPFD will focus on mainstreaming displacement considerations in&#13;
WBG policies, strategies and programs as a central aspect of the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s CEM and continue to contribute to the&#13;
global debates on displacement policy in order to further strengthen the development response of the&#13;
international community.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                      69&#13;
&amp;#12;Operational support&#13;
The strategic objective of GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s operational support is to provide WBG regional and country teams with the&#13;
necessary advisory, analytical, and operational support to address forced displacement within programs and&#13;
projects and to document and share operational evidence and experience.&#13;
&#13;
Moving forward, GPFD will continue to work on the regional initiatives in Africa, through: (i) continued policy&#13;
dialogue with government counterparts and development partners to identify policy, regulatory and operational&#13;
priorities to assist displaced populations and affected host and return communities; (ii) support for analytical&#13;
work to assess population displacement dynamics in a regional context including the prospects and options for&#13;
durable solutions, and (iii) the mainstreaming of displacement issues into existing and new development&#13;
operations at both national and regional level.&#13;
&#13;
In MENA, GPFD will further strengthen its collaboration with country teams and governments to both&#13;
understand and mitigate the impact of the Syrian displacement crisis. This includes regular updates of context&#13;
analysis, technical advices to task teams, specific analytical work, and operationally focused training&#13;
workshops for staff and governments. GPFDâ&#128;&#153;s collaboration with WBG economists undertaking assessments of&#13;
the social and economic impact of displacement in Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, and Turkey will remain a key priority.&#13;
As the Syrian and Iraq displacement crises continue to evolve, GPFD will work closely with the country teams&#13;
to build on existing work and to respond to new demands.&#13;
&#13;
In terms of country-specific engagements, experience to date shows that early, direct and sustained work with&#13;
operational teams based on analysis (for example the recent work in Ukraine) is an effective way to incorporate&#13;
a displacement lens in the development of operations and to contribute to policy dialogue. GPFD will continue&#13;
to focus on responding, where appropriate, to the existing and emerging demands in the countries facing&#13;
displacement challenges and ensure that there is timely and sustained delivery of technical and financial&#13;
support to respond to emerging client demands in crisis situations as and when opportunities arise in situations&#13;
of protracted displacement. Initially this will include continued support for the following priority countries:&#13;
Afghanistan, Azerbaijan, CAR, Georgia, Nigeria, Philippines, and West Bank and Gaza.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Analytical work&#13;
GPFD will, with internal and external partners, continue to support and lead the development of high quality analytical&#13;
work on forced displacement with internal and external partners with the aim of supporting both national and&#13;
international policy dialogue on the development dimensions of forced displacement and to identify the most&#13;
appropriate development responses. This will include a major flagship report on forced displacement, bringing together&#13;
the knowledge and lessons from analytical and operational work to date on the economic, fiscal and social impacts.&#13;
&#13;
The flagship report will be led by GPFD and undertaken in close collaboration with the offices of the Chief Economists of&#13;
the MENA and AFR region, building on the experience of the Syria crisis and displacement challenges in the Sahel,&#13;
Great Lakes and Horn regions of Africa. The report will aim to: (i) inform policy dialogue with governments and the&#13;
WBGâ&#128;&#153;s future work on forced displacement; (ii) build on operational experiences and completed and ongoing&#13;
impact assessments; (iii) develop an economic analysis of the problem, and make specific recommendations on&#13;
possible interventions, policy reforms, and priorities; (iv) identify critical knowledge gaps where further research is&#13;
needed; (v) highlight forced displacement as a development issue (and not merely as a humanitarian issue); and (vi)&#13;
inform the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s interventions on this issue at the WHS and preliminary discussion on the key issues for IDA 18.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
                                                           70&#13;
&amp;#12;GPFD will also develop a programmatic series on cross-Mediterranean migration and displacement, now a critical&#13;
concern to key European partners. The aim will be to better understand the drivers of migration in the countries of origin&#13;
and who has been impacted. GPFD will work closely with colleagues across the WBG to examine issues of financing&#13;
for refugees and displaced persons as a â&#128;&#152;global public goodâ&#128;&#153; and explore the demand for and feasibility of new financing&#13;
instruments or approaches.&#13;
&#13;
GPFD will work with country and regional teams on a series of impact assessments for specific policies or interventions&#13;
to inform policy dialogue and where relevant, identify a series of thematic and sector specific policy and guidance notes&#13;
to address key and emerging issues for example; urban displacement, gender and displacement, trauma and&#13;
displacement, sustainable refugee return, service delivery, governance and voice, resilience and forced displacement&#13;
and other thematic issues according to demand. GPFD will collaborate closely with relevant GPs, CCSAs, and CMUs to&#13;
complete ongoing analytical work and ensure a robust program of knowledge dissemination and use. Finally, GPFD will&#13;
complete analytical work on global policies and applications of refugeesâ&#128;&#153; ability to work and move, as requested by the&#13;
Mashreq CMU.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Partnerships&#13;
GPFD will continue to actively engage in critical partnerships on displacement and in the Solutions Alliance to&#13;
establish a more harmonized approach to the development aspects of displacement. With colleagues in the&#13;
FCV Group, and subject to additional resources, GPFD will explore opportunities to work more closely with the&#13;
g7+, OECD International Dialogue, and those working on the post MDG 2015 process (including the Secretary&#13;
Generalâ&#128;&#153;s working group on humanitarian financing) to ensure that forced displacement is well reflected in the&#13;
post-2015 agenda and the outcome document of the WHS and that there is sufficient global financing to meet&#13;
the challenges of displacement both in crisis and protracted situations. GPFD will organize a â&#128;&#152;knowledge forumâ&#128;&#153;&#13;
on forced displacement with key partners to provide a formalized platform for academics, policy makers and&#13;
practitioners to exchange. Internally, GPFD will continue to raise awareness of the development aspects of&#13;
forced displacement within the WBG. GPFD will continue regular dialogue with Global Practices, CCSAâ&#128;&#153;s,&#13;
regions and CMUs and will work with identified focal points across the WBG to ensure that lessons learned&#13;
from analytical and operational experience are fed into WBG policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
Knowledge&#13;
In the next phase of the program, GPFD will seek to document analytical and operational evidence and to&#13;
ensure knowledge and awareness on forced displacement is widely available and that analytical work is&#13;
disseminated and used across the WBG. GPFD will draw on the growing body of evidence to strengthen&#13;
country level dialogue and action on policies and interventions, knowledge dissemination, and monitoring and&#13;
evaluation for greater results and impact. For example, following the expression of interest from clients in the&#13;
MENA region GPFD will work with the region to support the development of peer to peer workshops with&#13;
governments on forced displacement and development. GPFD will concentrate additional resources on the&#13;
development of core training for key staff on the issue of forced displacement through a series of specialist&#13;
workshops and hands on training for staff and TTLs. GPFD will also further strengthen its module on forced&#13;
displacement in the FCV Group Core Course. The team will draw up a schedule of targeted dissemination&#13;
events, further develop the website and publicize and disseminate key analytical work.&#13;

&#13;
CONCLUSION&#13;
There is now growing recognition of the immense global development challenges and opportunities that conflict&#13;
induced forced displacement raises, and the issue is receiving prominence on the international agenda. Unless&#13;
it is addressed, it will pose a real threat to the achievement of the new SDGs and the WBGâ&#128;&#153;s goal of reducing&#13;
extreme poverty and increasing shared prosperity. There is strong commitment from the WBG to this agenda.&#13;
The WBG can use its convening power, analytical, technical and operational strengths to work closely with&#13;
affected governments to address the development needs of IDPs, refugees, returnees, and host communities&#13;
alongside other development, humanitarian, political and security actors. Building on the momentum over the&#13;
past 18 months, GPFD will seek additional resources to significantly scale up its activities, both within and&#13;
outside the WBG. GPFD is well positioned to play a catalytic and transformative role in enhancing the&#13;
development response to forced displacement challenges at the policy and operational level.&#13;

&amp;#12;ANNEX 3: SRI MULYANIâ&#128;&#153;S OP-ED ON&#13;
         REGIONAL INTEGRATION30&#13;
Conflict doesnâ&#128;&#153;t respect borders. No one knows this better than the people in Africaâ&#128;&#153;s Great Lakes region where&#13;
instability has been fueled in part by a lack of economic opportunity.&#13;
&#13;
For the Great Lakes Region, where I will visit next week, the cost of conflict has been extraordinary. Among the&#13;
11.5 million people in the Eastern Congo, are 2 million children who donâ&#128;&#153;t get an education because their&#13;
schools have been destroyed; over 3.5 million people have died since 1998 as a direct consequence of conflict.&#13;
The 2013 peace framework signed by 11 nations ushered in a new era for peace and reconstruction. But&#13;
pockets of violence persist.&#13;
&#13;
The wider region remains host to over five million people who have fled their homes due to ongoing insecurity.&#13;
&#13;
The Great Lakes countries share similar challenges such as communal violence, lack of access to land, limited&#13;
social cohesion and competition over resources. These challenges must be tackled by individual countries, but&#13;
more often than not, they require collective action. Regional approaches are critical to leverage national efforts.&#13;
&#13;
Borders can be both a factor and a feature of conflict. I firmly believe that they can also be part of the solution.&#13;
They provide security and facilitate trade between countries. To borrow the words of Mexican-American poet&#13;
Gina ValdÃ©s: â&#128;&#156;For every border, there is also a bridge.â&#128;&#157;&#13;
&#13;
In this region, as elsewhere, regional integration is the key to lasting peace and to a more prosperous future.&#13;
Peace accords are critical. They end conflict but they donâ&#128;&#153;t always bring lasting peace. It takes livelihoods, jobs,&#13;
and trust in the future that can bring countries closer together and making it worthwhile to invest in peace. We&#13;
all know that there wonâ&#128;&#153;t be development without peace nor can there be peace without development.&#13;
&#13;
The pay offs of cooperation and integration are significant. Take for example the East African Community.&#13;
Since 1993, it has been the second-fastest growing economic bloc in the world, after ASEAN, the Association&#13;
of Southeast Asian Nations. It has doubled its GDP to $79 billion, and intra-community trade is now more&#13;
important than trade with Europe or the rest of Africa.&#13;
&#13;
In my previous capacity as Finance Minister of Indonesia, a country where the transition toward democracy and&#13;
a unified society took more than a decade â&#128;&#148;and a founding member of ASEANâ&#128;&#148;, I have experienced firsthand&#13;
the positive impact of regional integration on creating sound and predictable economic policies, resulting in high&#13;
economic growth, job creation and poverty reduction. ASEAN and East Asia are now the worldâ&#128;&#153;s most vibrant&#13;
region with low barriers to trade and investment, allowing goods and people to move relatively freely.&#13;
&#13;
The WBG, one of the Great Lakes regionâ&#128;&#153;s most important development partners, has an important role to play&#13;
in supporting regional peace and stability through programs that improve livelihoods in border areas, facilitate&#13;
cross-border trade and strengthen economic interdependence through connective infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;

                                                              78&#13;
&amp;#12;For many communities, key markets are situated across the border and informal cross-border trade plays a&#13;
huge role in linking small producers to markets. Consider this: between 2012 and 2014, informal exports from&#13;
Rwanda to neighboring countries including Burundi, DRC, Tanzania and Uganda, totaled nearly $100 million.&#13;
&#13;
Making trade more user-friendly and safe is essential. A study looking at cross-border trade between the DRC&#13;
and Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda showed that women, who represent the majority of small informal traders,&#13;
are often victims of harassment and physical violence and are forced to pay bribes. For the millions of women&#13;
and their families whose livelihoods depend on cross-border trade, regional integration shouldnâ&#128;&#153;t be an abstract&#13;
concept, nor a dangerous undertaking. Women are the key to boosting trade and prosperity, and their ability to&#13;
do so safely is paramount.&#13;
&#13;
The prospects for international trade to drive growth and fight poverty are enormous and go far beyond DRC&#13;
and its neighbors. In Eastern DRC rehabilitating the Goma Airport will create a vital transport hub to reconnect&#13;
the people of the region to the rest of the country, stimulate private sector development, and enable trade to&#13;
resume. Evidence also suggests that insecurity is decreasing in areas where roads have been rehabilitated.&#13;
This is why all countries should have a common interest in developing regional infrastructure.&#13;
&#13;
The WBG launched the Great Lakes Initiative in 2013 together with UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. We&#13;
are providing about $1.3 billion for regional initiatives that expand hydropower; transport and information&#13;
technology; trade; health services; and address sexual and gender-based violence and forced displacement.&#13;
&#13;
We are also supporting investments in energy which will significantly increase access to electricity Rwanda,&#13;
DRC, and Burundi.&#13;
&#13;
Through the Great Lakes initiative we have refocused our work around prevention and response not just in one&#13;
country, but among neighbors. We hope to deliver a major contribution to the lasting peace and development of&#13;
this region that has suffered so much from conflict and has so much to gain from peace.&#13;

            Global Program on Forced Displacement
            (GPFD) annual progress report (January 2014 - June 2015)
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This report is structured around these
            four lines of activity. In the past 18 months, the WBG has
            seen a dramatic increase in client demand for development
            work on forced displacement, particularly in the AFR and
            MENA regions. To meet this demand, GPFD is scaling up its
            analytical, operational and partnership support to country
            and regional teams. Senior management across the WBG is
            giving the issue greater priority as illustrated by the
            recent joint visits of the WBG President and the UN
            Secretary General to the Sahel, Great Lakes, and the Horn,
            with announcements of operational funds directed to forced
            displacement. The WBG is increasingly considered an
            important actor in global policy discussions on forced
            displacement and in efforts to find lasting solutions. With
            its new location in the CCSA on FCV, GPFD is centrally
            located as the custodian of global knowledge and lessons
            learned on forced displacement and development in the WBG.
            The following sections provide an overview of GPFD’s key
            achievements and activities for the reporting period 1
            January 2014 to 30 June 2015.
