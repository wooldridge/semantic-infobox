Since the 1990s, there have been several attempts in India to             that have not been abandoned at conceptualization stage&#13;
involve the private sector in urban water supply services. These          (Table 1). Information was collected though consultations and&#13;
attempts have had mixed outcomes: while several projects                  interviews with government and private sector stakeholders&#13;
planned during the initial years were abandoned in the                    and PPP experts, as well as from publicly available documents&#13;
development phase, there has been an increase in the number               and project case studies.&#13;
of contracts awarded to the private sector in recent years.&#13;
There has also been a change in the type of projects developed            The term PPP in the Indian urban water sector generally&#13;
and the role of the private sector in these projects.                     does not mean provider functions being contracted out in&#13;
                                                                          their entirety to a private provider. For the purpose of this&#13;

sector participation in Indian urban water supply services,&#13;
                                                                          services (such as bulk water supply, domestic piped supply&#13;

sector participation; draws on learning from project design               not involve private sector investments. Further, the study is&#13;
and the transactions; and reflects on future directions. As               restricted only to formal PPP arrangements sanctioned by the&#13;
most such projects are still at early stages, it has not been             city/utility. Informal private provisioning of water services,&#13;
possible to assess their operating or financial performance               as is commonly found in low income neighborhoods, is&#13;
in any depth. The study covers Public Private Partnership                 therefore not included under this study.&#13;

    Increase in the number of PPP projects&#13;
    reaching contract award stage&#13;
    Since the 1990s, there has been an increase in the number of&#13;
    PPP projects initiated or awarded. Whereas only four PPP&#13;
    contracts were awarded before 2004, another 13 were awarded&#13;
    since 2005. Before 2004, only 40 percent of the initiated&#13;
    projects were successfully awarded, whereas since 2005, all&#13;
    the projects initiated were awarded. Some 5 million1 people&#13;
    in urban areas now obtain water supply through projects or&#13;
    institutional arrangements that involve the private sector.&#13;

    PPP contracts is presented in Figure 1.&#13;
&#13;
    Shift in the geographic concentration&#13;
    of PPPs&#13;
    There has been a gradual broadening of states and cities where&#13;
    PPPs have been undertaken in the water sector. In the 1990s,&#13;
    such initiatives were largely concentrated in the southern&#13;
    states of Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, and Andhra Pradesh.&#13;

Between 2000 and 2004, projects were being proposed in                    bulk water supply augmentation and O&amp;M of the entire&#13;
Karnataka, Delhi, Maharashtra, and Andhra Pradesh, and                    water supply system (Figure 2).&#13;
since 2005, elsewhere, including Madhya Pradesh and West&#13;
Bengal. The availability of public funding under schemes                  The type of PPP arrangements has also changed. During&#13;
such as JNNURM has enabled a wider cross-section of                       the 1990s, the trend was primarily Build Operate Transfer&#13;
states and cities to initiate projects on their own. Positive             (BOT) with 100 percent private financing. The majority of&#13;
experiences with national PPPs in other infrastructure sectors            the O&amp;M improvements since 2000 involved management&#13;
â&#128;&#148;especially energyâ&#128;&#148;have also stimulated interest in water                 contracts, with the public sector providing most of the&#13;
supply PPPs.                                                              investment. Learning from the failure of the earlier large-&#13;
                                                                          scale BOT projects, state governments, and international&#13;
More PPPs for distribution improvements                                   funding agencies encouraged the management contract model&#13;
Most of the water supply PPP projects during the 1990s                    to emulate the managerial efficiencies of the private sector,&#13;
were aimed at augmentation of bulk water supply systems.                  while minimizing the risks and costs associated with previous&#13;
Since the early 2000s, however, 80 percent of the projects                project structures.&#13;
that attempted to bring in the private sector were aimed at&#13;
operation and maintenance (O&amp;M) improvements of the                       Today, the operational contracts are a mix of concession&#13;
distribution system. Today, approximately 60 percent of PPP               agreements, BOT projects, and management contracts.&#13;
projects address O&amp;M improvements, 30 percent focus on                    There are variations in the BOT models implemented, with&#13;
bulk water supply augmentation, and the rest include both                 a few of them requiring partial to full private financing. The&#13;

    the time taken between project initiation and the award of                but since 2005, a growing number of urban water supply&#13;
    contract has become much shorter. Up to 2000, the average                 PPP projects have been developed on the basis of substantial&#13;

    2005 the time taken between project initiation and awarding               developed with financial support from the central government.&#13;
    PPP contracts has been two-and-a-half years on average.                   The capital injection from schemes such as JNNURM and&#13;
    The reduced private investment component and absence of                   UIDSSMT has been a major driver of this shift. Public&#13;
    tariff implications may have contributed to a shorter project             funding for PPP projects in progress within the JNNURM&#13;
    development period.                                                       framework (including the UIDSSMT component) covers&#13;

    Reduced reliance on multilateral                                          Moreover, JNNURM has created an impetus for private&#13;
    funding for PPPs                                                          sector participation. The additional funding lowers the cost of&#13;
    The attempted early water supply PPPs followed strong                     PPPs, and the appraisal process under the program encourages&#13;
    advocacy by multilateral funding agencies and, up to the                  PPP-based projects.&#13;
    mid-2000s, several depended heavily on financial assistance&#13;
    from these agencies to meet capital costs. However, since                 Given the high risk perceptions about water PPPs in India,&#13;

    Bodies (ULBs) and state departments.                                      weak financial health of ULBs, most public funding would&#13;

            Trends in private sector participation in
            the Indian water sector : a critical review
        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            Since the 1990s, there have been several
            attempts in India to involve the private sector in urban
            water supply services. These attempts have had mixed
            outcomes: while several projects planned during the initial
            years were abandoned in the development phase, there has
            been an increase in the number of contracts awarded to the
            private sector in recent years. There has also been a change
            in the type of projects developed and the role of the
            private sector in these projects. This study reviews trends
            and the factors that have facilitated or impeded the
            development and implementation of projects in the sector
            with private sector participation; draws on learning from
            project design and the transactions; and reflects on future
            directions. As most such projects are still at early stages,
            it has not been possible to assess their operating or
            financial performance in any depth. The study covers Public
            Private Partnership (PPP) attempts in urban water supply
            from 1990 till 2009, which have not been abandoned at
            conceptualization stage. Information was collected though
            consultations and interviews with government and private
            sector stakeholders and PPP experts, as well as from
            publicly available documents and project case studies.
