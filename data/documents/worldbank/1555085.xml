DEVELOPMENT PROBLEMS OF MINERAL EXPORTING COUNTRIES&#13;
A Background Study for World Development Report, 1979&#13;
A number of structural features associated with the historical, technical&#13;
and institutional development of the mining industry distinguish the mineral-&#13;
exporting countries (the mineral economies) from other developing countries,&#13;
especially the predominantly agricultural nations, and present these countries&#13;
with a special set of development opportunities and problems. The essential&#13;
advantage of the mineral economies lies in their possession of a resource&#13;
that is readily converted into a large financial flow, much of it in the form&#13;
of foreign exchange. However, the mineral economies must contend with the&#13;
fundamental fact that their mineral wealth is exhaustible. This peculiar&#13;
combination of circumstances gives rise to various problems of economic&#13;
management, the discussion of which forms the core of this paper. Thus,&#13;
mineral economies tend to be especially characterized by technological and&#13;
wage dualism; they are prone to neglect their non-mineral sectors&#13;
(particularly agriculture); their export earnings are often marked by&#13;
instability; and they are subject to strong inflationary pressures.&#13;
Further, to maximize their benefits they must exact the economic rents&#13;
inherent in the production and sale of their mineral resources, thus&#13;
requiring to pay special attention to mineral taxation, participation in the&#13;
mining industry, and negotiations with foreign mining companies. Finally,&#13;
the mineral economies need to adopt a strategy which, through an efficient&#13;
sequencing and sectoral distribution of investments, will create a diversified&#13;
and growing economy before their mineral rents wither away. These problems&#13;
and objectives, the paper concludes, require a wide array of policy changes&#13;
that are largely institutional in nature, and the appropriate setting at the&#13;
earliest possible stage, of two key 'prices' - 'the' mining sector wage-rate&#13;
and 'the' exchange-rate.&#13;

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS&#13;
This paper is designed to provide a perspective on the development&#13;
problems of the mineral economies 1/ and to offer recommendations on policy&#13;
choices to confront these problems. In a more conjectural vein, an attempt is&#13;
made to assess the long-term prospects of the mineral economies.&#13;
The major working hypothesis of the study is that the mineral economies&#13;
share enough common characteristics to have economic advantages and problems that&#13;
set them apart from other developing countries. These differences arise in the&#13;
first place because the mineral economies differ from the non-mineral economies&#13;
structurally. In the second place, there is evidence to suggest also that the&#13;
economic performance of the mineral economies, along various dimensions, also&#13;
differs from that of a control group of non-mineral economies. These differences&#13;
of structure and performance suggest the elements of a policy framework that&#13;
could remedy the major development problems of the mineral economies.&#13;
The number of mineral economies has been growing in recent years, and&#13;
there is reason to expect many more developing countries to become mineral&#13;
exporters in future. An additional concern of this study has therefore been to&#13;
offer informed conjectures on the development prospects of the mineral economies.&#13;
More specifically, this paper permits the following propositions, each&#13;
of which is dealt with in greater detail below:&#13;
Proposition 1: The mineral economies differ structurally from other&#13;
developing countries, and in particular, from other primary-exporting (i.e.,&#13;
agricultural) developing countries.&#13;
Proposition 2: These structural differences, and the typical policy&#13;
responses to them, tend to render the mineral economies more prone to a number&#13;
of economic problems as compared to non-mineral economies.&#13;
Proposition 3: The recent economic performance of the mineral&#13;
economies suggests that their long-term prospects are moderately favorable, but&#13;
depend critically on the ctioice of policy objectives and instruments.&#13;
Proposition 4: To sustain vigorous economic growth and diversify&#13;
their economies as their mineral reserves are depleted, and to increase employ-&#13;
ment, will require: (a) a wide array of changes that are largely institutional&#13;
in nature, and (b) the appropriate setting of two key 'prices' - 'the' mining&#13;
sector wage rate and 'the' exchange rate.&#13;
1/ The term 'mineral economies' is meant to capture those developing countries&#13;
in which the high share of mineral production in GDP and of mineral exports&#13;
in total exports render the mineral sector the keystone of the economy;&#13;
some discretion is used in the choice of countries but the guiding thresholds&#13;
are: 10 percent or more of GDP in 1967-75 and 40 percent of total merchandise&#13;
exports in 1973-76. The countries considered are Algeria, Angola, Bolivia,&#13;
Chile, Congo P.R., Ecuador, Gabon, Guinea, Guyana, Indonesia, Iran, Iraq,&#13;
Jamaica, Kuwait, Liberia, Libyan A.R., Mauritania, Morocco, Nigeria, Peru,&#13;
Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone, Syrian A.R., Togo, Trinidad and Tobago, Venezuela,&#13;
Zaire, Zambia. Minerals are defined to include bauxite, copper, iron ore, lead,&#13;
Manganese ore, petroleum, phosphate rock, tin and zinc.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Proposition 1, which argues that the mineral economies differ&#13;
structurally from other developing countries, rests on five interrelated sub-&#13;
propositions arising from the nature of the mining industry. These are:&#13;
Sub-Proposition 1.1: The mineral economies are characterized by an overwhelming&#13;
dominance of the fiscal linkage over production and consumption linkages; this&#13;
structural feature underlines the importance (a) of maximizing the fiscal&#13;
linkage and (b) of the state's role in transforming the economy.&#13;
Historically, export-led development has been characterized by the&#13;
presence of production and consumption linkages between the export industry and&#13;
secondary and tertiary industries. Thus, through the external effects of inputs&#13;
demanded, outputs supplied, consumer markets created, and education provided or&#13;
stimulated by the export industry, development has spread through the initially&#13;
export-oriented economy.&#13;
Studies of the linkage effects of mining activities in numerous&#13;
mineral economies such as Zambia, Chile, Zaire, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia, Iran,&#13;
Venezuela and Sierra Leone unequivocally support the conclusion that mining,&#13;
unlike other historical staples, has been notably deficient in production and&#13;
consumption linkages, while fiscal linkages make a strong showing. The&#13;
difference between production and consumption linkages on the one hand, and&#13;
fiscal linkages on the other hand, is that the former share an automaticity&#13;
that is glaringly absent in the latter. Production and consumption linkages&#13;
work themselves out through the market, assuming the social milieu and policy&#13;
environment are supportive. But the success of the fiscal linkage depends on&#13;
the willingness and ability of governments to tax or otherwise participate in&#13;
the incomes originating in mining; and in addition, the ability to tax must&#13;
be combined with an ability to invest productively. It is in this lack of&#13;
automaticity that the major weakness of the fiscal linkage lies. The dominance&#13;
of the fiscal linkage in mineral economies implies (a) that maximizing the&#13;
magnitude of the fiscal linkage is a critical problem for the mineral economiest&#13;
and (b) that more than for the typical developing country, the role of the&#13;
state in the sectoral allocation of investments largely determines the directior&#13;
in which the transformation of the economy proceeds.&#13;
Sub-Proposition 1.2: The mineral economies differ from non-mineral economies&#13;
also because the mining industry is characterized (a) by the presence of large&#13;
foreign mining companies (FMCs) and (b) by the existence of a large element of&#13;
rent in the market value of minerals. 1/ The rent element, if not tapped, tend;&#13;
to migrate out of the mineral economy because of the dominant role of FMCs in&#13;
the industry and the high proportion of mining output that is exported.&#13;
1/ The concept of economic rent refers to the surplus earned by factors of&#13;
production over and above the minimum earnings necessary to induce their&#13;
employment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iii -&#13;
The presence of large FMCs in the mining industry is a well established&#13;
fact, despite the increasing participation of state owned enterprises in mining&#13;
activity. It is also well known that five types of rent may be distinguished in&#13;
the mining industry: scarcity, differential, quasi, windfall and monopolistic.&#13;
The objective of mineral economies is simple: it is to capture all rents while&#13;
letting the investor make the return necessary to induce him to invest. But&#13;
collecting all of rent, however desirable, is generally not possible, since its&#13;
size is not easily established. In principle the easiest way to capture all&#13;
rents is to mine, process and market the mineral, but this requires large&#13;
investments and highly sophisticated skills.&#13;
The weakness of production and consumption linkages and the difficul-&#13;
ties of capturing rents imply that mineral economies must pay particular&#13;
attention to mineral taxation, participation in the mining industry and, in&#13;
general, to negotiations with FMCs. The complexity of these tasks sets the&#13;
mineral economies apart from many non-mineral economies, particularly the&#13;
agricultural exporting countries.&#13;
Sub-Proposition 1.3: The mineral economies are less likely to be subject to&#13;
fiscal and/or foreign exchange gaps for a reasonable range of growth rates, at&#13;
least while their mineral reserves last.&#13;
The mineral economies, as noted above, tend to reap substantial fiscal&#13;
resources from the mining sector,and since minerals are internationally traded&#13;
these are received in the form of foreign exchange. The relative ease with&#13;
which mineral economies have access to this flow of fiscal revenue in the form&#13;
of foreign exchange arises principally because (a) unlike the agricultural&#13;
primary exporters, the mineral economies export products with high income&#13;
elasticities of demand and (b) taxes on the mining sector, which is easily&#13;
identified and often foreign-owned, are easier to levy and to administer&#13;
relative to taxes on agricultural or other incomes.&#13;
However, this is not an unmixed blessing. Their greater dependence&#13;
on a single sector for large shares of their fiscal and foreign exchange&#13;
resources gives rise to periodic instabilities in the levels of these resources.&#13;
Sub-Proposition 1.4: The mineral economies, to a somewhat greater degree than&#13;
other developing countries, have the option of pursuing a resource-based&#13;
industrialization strategy.&#13;
Of the four strategies of industrialization that are being undertaken&#13;
or advocated for the developing countries, namely import substitution, exports&#13;
of labor-intensive manufactures, resource-based processing, and basic goods&#13;
production, the latter two are based on the domestic processing of natural&#13;
resources, in particular minerals and agricultural commodities.&#13;
The case for mineral processing as the centerpiece of an industria-&#13;
lization strategy must be distinguished from a selective emphasis on mineral&#13;
processing. The former type of strategy, being highly capital intensive, is&#13;
suited primarily to mineral economies with extremely high mineral wealth per&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- iv -&#13;
capita. The development strategies adopted by many mineral economies, for&#13;
example, Algeria, Iran and Trinidad and Tobago, suggest that there has been an&#13;
overemphasis on mineral-based industrialization. The relevance and merit of the&#13;
mineral-based industrialization option, although deserving of emphasis, have&#13;
clearly been exaggerated. Selective mineral processing, on the other hand, is&#13;
easily justified on value-added grounds for one or more of the following reasons:&#13;
the raw material cost shares of such industries, the relative abundance of&#13;
critical complementary inputs (such as natural gas or hydropower for aluminum&#13;
smelting), or as a mechanism for exacting mineral rents.&#13;
Sub-Proposition 1.5: The mineral economies have an exhaustible resource and&#13;
thus transforming and diversifying their economies (before the mineral wealth&#13;
is entirely depleted) are objectives of greater priority for them than for&#13;
predominantly agricultural countries.&#13;
Though the distinction is not a rigid one, since new mineral finds&#13;
are often made, and since some mineral economies have reserves that are not&#13;
expected to be depleted for a hundred or more years (e.g. Guinea and Jamaica&#13;
for bauxite), it does identify a structural feature that would be expected to&#13;
affect the development strategy of mineral economies vis-a-vis predominantly&#13;
agricultural countries.&#13;
II&#13;
Proposition 2 suggests that the preceding structural differences, in&#13;
conjunction with typical policy choices that have been made in the mineral&#13;
economies, render these economies more prone to a number of economic problems.&#13;
To test the underlying hypotheses a control group comprising all non-mineral&#13;
middle income countries was used. The hypotheses and the degree of support&#13;
they receive are summarized below. 1/&#13;
Hypothesis 2.1: The saving performance of the mineral economies is poorer than&#13;
that of non-mineral economies.&#13;
This hypothesis is difficult to test, not least because the mineral&#13;
economies' mineral wealth is of uncertain magnitude, but also because the&#13;
evidence is mixed: average as well as incremental national saving rates are&#13;
higher in the mineral than in the non-mineral economies, but incremental saving&#13;
rates are lower in the non-fuel mineral economies than in the non-mineral&#13;
economies. A third test, which compares the saving rates of the mineral and&#13;
1/   These hypotheses are only superficially tested here.   A thorough&#13;
statistical test would require that for each dependent variable we&#13;
demonstrate a statistically significant difference between the mineral&#13;
and non-mineral economies. Time constraints have made this impracticable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
non-mineral econ-Ti'.3 with their respective "norm" saving rates, 1! a1so confirms&#13;
that the non-fuel mineral economies have under-saved in recent years. IrL con-&#13;
trast, the saving recorc jf the petroleum economies compares very favorably with&#13;
their respective "norms". It is noteworthy that neither the non-mineral&#13;
economies nor the latter "norms" provide a measuring rod for evaluating the post-&#13;
1973 saving behavior of the petroleum economies. Thus, we are uncertain about&#13;
the relative saving performance of the petroleum economies, but that of the non-&#13;
fuel mineral economies seems to compare unfavorably with the non-mineral&#13;
economies.&#13;
Hypothesis 2.2: The mineral economies are characterized by greater technological&#13;
and wage dualism, higher unemployment, and lower school enrollment ratios than&#13;
the non-mineral economies.&#13;
The literature is replete with evidence supporting the view that the&#13;
mining industry has been highly capital-intensive and is becoming increasingly&#13;
so, while mineral processing and related industries are also among the most&#13;
capital-intensive manufacturing activities. A major empirical correlate of&#13;
technological dualism in the mineral economies is wage dualism, evidence of&#13;
which exists in the literature and is revealed by a study of the mining-&#13;
manufacturing wage differentials in mineral economies. Not all mineral economies&#13;
have highly dualistic wage structures: around 1970, Algeria, Nigeria and&#13;
Bolivia had a low mining-manufacturing wage differential, while Zambia, Venezuela,&#13;
Chile, Jamaica had very high wage dualism. The tendency does exist however, and&#13;
is a major obstacle for the development of the mineral economies. The evidence&#13;
on unemployment is also mixed, but there is again a tendency for mineral&#13;
economies to exhibit high unemployment: among the mineral economies for which da-&#13;
ta are available, Bolivia, Zambia, Morocco, Algeria, Trinidad and Tobago and&#13;
Jamaica have open unemployment rates greater than 10 percent of the labor force,&#13;
while Syria, Iraq, Iran, Indonesia and Venezuela have an average unemployment&#13;
rate of 4 percent.&#13;
Finally, data on school enrollment indicate that the mineral economies&#13;
lag significantly behind the non-mineral economies. Despite large increases in&#13;
school enrollment in mineral economies over the past fifteen years, the gap&#13;
between them and the non mineral economies has not narrowed.&#13;
Hypothesis 2.3: Inflation rates tend to be higher in the mineral economies than&#13;
in the non-mineral economies.&#13;
Between 1960 and 1970, inflation rates were of the same order of&#13;
magnitude in the mineral and non-mineral economies, but they were significantly&#13;
higher than these average rates in the non-fuel mineral economies. In recent&#13;
years (1970-76) inflation has been higher in the mineral than the non-mineral&#13;
economies, but this difference is accounted for primarily by the petroleum&#13;
economies. Thus it may be inferred that mineral economies tend to exhibit&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

k. ''.,2er inflation rates, and in particular that the largcar inve't-mernLs made by the&#13;
petroleum economies in recent years have been higiily inftationat3.   In this regard,&#13;
the experiences of Iran and Nigeria are noteworthy.&#13;
Hypothesis 2.4:  Agriculture tends to grow inore siwl.-, and food constitutes a&#13;
larger share of total imports, in mineral than in non--nineral economies.&#13;
The evidence clearly confirms both these hypotheses. Although indivi-&#13;
dual mineral economies may have reason to shift resources out of agriculture,&#13;
this is unlikely to be true for all mineral ecao:mies.&#13;
Hypothesis 2.5: Mineral economies are more subject to export earnings instability&#13;
that non-mineral economies.&#13;
An examination of indices of export earnings instability shows the&#13;
evidence to be mixed: export earnings were less stable, on the average, in the&#13;
mineral than in the non-mineral economies in both 1961-72 and 1968-73, but in&#13;
the latter period, earnings were more stable in the non-fuel mineral economies&#13;
than in the non-mineral economies. It is well known that agricultural product&#13;
exporters are subject to similarly high export earnings instability. Once again,&#13;
however, the tendency does seem to be unmistakable. Also suggestive is the&#13;
finding that debt GNP ratios are significantly higher among mineral than among&#13;
non-mineral economies, but though these high ratios are associated with unstable&#13;
export earnings, they may also be due to poor saving performance and almost&#13;
certainly reflect poor macro-economic management.&#13;
Hypothesis 2.6: The exports of mineral economies tend to remain more concentrated&#13;
than those of non-mineral economies.&#13;
Between 1960 and 1975, the petroleum economies and the non-fuel mineral&#13;
economies increased their dependence on exports of minerals and of primary&#13;
commodities generally. The evidence on the poorer export-diversification&#13;
performance of the mineral economies thus seems incontrovertible.&#13;
It may be concluded that there is substantial support for the view that&#13;
mineral economies, relative to non-mineral economies, perform poorly in agricul-&#13;
ture, export diversification and inflation; and tnat the evidence suggests a&#13;
greater tendency for the mineral economies to be characterised by poorer saving&#13;
performance, greater technological/wage dualism, higher unemployment, higher&#13;
external indebtedness and higher export earnings instability.&#13;
III&#13;
Proposition 3 alludes to the nature of the recent economic performance&#13;
of the mineral economies, and suggests that their long-term prospects are&#13;
moderately favorable. The basis of this judgement is essentially that the recent&#13;
economic performance of these economies has been very mixed. Proposition 3 rests&#13;
on two sub-propositions, the first factual and the second both factual and&#13;
conjectural, that are summarised below:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- vii -&#13;
Sub-Proposition 3.1: The economic performance of the mineral economies, judged&#13;
by reference to the five indices of saving, growth in agricultural production,&#13;
export diversification, inflation and the choice of investment priorities, shows&#13;
no clear country patterns, and exhibits both positive and negative findings.&#13;
Although, on the average, the mineral economies' performances in&#13;
agriculture and inflation may be described as poor, and those in saving, export&#13;
diversification and investment priorities as moderate, there are sufficient&#13;
differences in their achievements to suggest that the basis for a successful&#13;
transformation is being laid in some of them -- notably Venezuela, Morocco and&#13;
Algeria. On the other hand, there is enough evidence of poor performance on the&#13;
part of others to suggest that their transformation is unlikely to occur if&#13;
present trends continue. This group includes countries such as Zaire, Zambia,&#13;
Indonesia, Ecuador, Trinidad and Tobago, Congo P.R., Chile and Bolivia.&#13;
Some of the most encouraging findings are that: agricultural produc-&#13;
tion has grown faster in countries with large agricultural potential, such as&#13;
Bolivia, Guinea, Zambia and Ecuador; incremental saving rates are higher in&#13;
countries in the middle stages of their mineral exploitation such as Gabon, Iran&#13;
and Nigeria; and export diversification has been most successful in countries&#13;
in the late stages of mineral exploitation, notably Venezuela and Peru.&#13;
The discouraging findings include the conclusion that the incremental&#13;
saving rate is lowest in the least well-endowed of the mineral economies (those&#13;
with low capital resources); although this may be understandable, it suggests&#13;
that these countries are not making the saving effort required to attain their&#13;
growth and transformation objectives. In this respect, the saving performance&#13;
of countries such as Peru, Congo P.D.R., Syria and Togo has been disappointing.&#13;
Also unsettling is the finding that mineral economies of long standing have&#13;
done no better at export diversification than have the newer ones. 1/ Thus the&#13;
continued high dependence on minerals of countries such as Bolivia, Chile, Zambia,&#13;
Iran and Iraq is similar to that of newer mineral economies such as Libya and&#13;
Nigeria. Finally, inflation, which has been high in most mineral economies, has&#13;
been particularly high in the larger mineral economies and in countries at the&#13;
late mineral-exploitation stage; examples of the former group are Iran, Nigeria,&#13;
Indonesia, Peru and Zaire, while the latter group includes Trinidad and Tobago,&#13;
Bolivia, Syria and Venezuela.&#13;
Sub-Proposition 3.2: The economic performance of the mineral economies, when&#13;
evaluated against alternative pessimistic and optimistic scenarios, suggests&#13;
that their prospects are moderately favorable.&#13;
Two criteria underlie the conceptualization of pessimistic and optimistic&#13;
scenarios for the mineral economies: the size of the country's mineral wealth per&#13;
1/ Mineral economies of long standing are not necessarily also in the late&#13;
stages of mineral exploitation, and vice versa. Thus Iran, Chile and&#13;
Zambia are 'old' mineral economies but are in their middle stage of&#13;
exploitation, while Ecuador and Indonesia are 'new' but in their last&#13;
stage of mineral exploitation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-viii -&#13;
capita and the country's stage of mineral exploitation. The optimistic view&#13;
contends (a) that although the prospects of mineral economies with more mineral&#13;
wealth per capita are better than those with less mineral wealth per capita, the&#13;
relative economic performance of the latter group will be superior to that of&#13;
the former; 1/ and (b) that economic performance will improve with the stage of&#13;
mineral exploitation. 2/ The pessimistic view contends (a) that the economic&#13;
performance of the lower per capita mineral wealth countries will be relatively&#13;
poorer than that of the other mineral economies, and will thus reinforce the&#13;
differences between the two groups; and (b) that economic performance will&#13;
remain generally poor through the various stages of mineral exploitation.&#13;
The actual economic performance of the mineral economies in recent years&#13;
is found to be superior to that in the pessimistic scenario, but falls short of&#13;
that in the optimistic scenario. Although this is interpreted as suggesting&#13;
moderate optimism for the mineral economies' long-term prospects, it is clear&#13;
that much will depend on improving performance in saving, in increasing agricul-&#13;
tural growth rates, in keeping down inflation and, perhaps most importantly, in&#13;
choosing the right investment priorities and diversifying exports.&#13;
The task ahead is not an easy one. But the rewards to informed&#13;
economic choices and policies are likely to be high, for some mineral economies&#13;
have done better than others.&#13;
IV&#13;
Proposition 4 deals with the policy framework for mineral economies&#13;
and rests largely on the preceding propositions. Thus, the differences of&#13;
structure and performance between mineral and non-mineral economies suggest the&#13;
policy objectives that ought to be adopted by the mineral economies. Proposition&#13;
3 suggests that differences in economic performance across mineral economies may&#13;
be attributed to differences in their policy choices.&#13;
1/ Thus the optimistic view would suggest that the economic performance of&#13;
low-capital group countries such as Liberia, Zaire, Nigeria, Peru, Syria,&#13;
Indonesia, Togo would be superior to that of high-capital group countries&#13;
such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Libya, where economic performance denotes&#13;
saving, agricultural growth, export diversification, inflation and choice&#13;
of investment priorities.&#13;
2/ Again, the optimistic view would predict that along the same five dimensions,&#13;
the economic performance of late mineral-exploitation stage countries such&#13;
as Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Peru, Syria, Congo P.R., Bolivia and&#13;
Indonesia would be superior to that of early or middle-stage countries such&#13;
as Liberia, Iran, Nigeria, Zaire, Chile, Jamaica, Morocco and Guyana.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ix -&#13;
The paper identifies three sets of major policy objectives for the&#13;
mineral economies (see chart on page xviii).First, arising from their structural&#13;
features and from their peculiar incentive-wage-consumption dynamic, 1/ the paper&#13;
emphasizes the following objectives: fiscal and foreign exchange stability,&#13;
higher marginal savings, more rapid employment growth, greater price stability,&#13;
faster agricultural growth, more stable export earnings, and more export&#13;
diversification. Secondly, with respect to investment priorities and sequencing,&#13;
mineral economies have been apt to overstress mineral based processing and under-&#13;
emphasize labor-intensive manufacturing, agriculture, small-scale enterprise&#13;
development and expenditure on research and development, while inappropriate&#13;
sequencing of investments has led to some waste of resources. It is important&#13;
to note, however, that although the benefits of mineral-processing are often&#13;
exaggerated, there is still substantial scope for such processing in the mineral&#13;
economies, and surmounting entry barriers in this highly oligopolistic industry&#13;
remains an important policy objective. Thirdly, it is argued that given the&#13;
importance of the fiscal linkage, maximizing the exaction of mineral rents must&#13;
remain an important objective; in particular, there are substantial differences&#13;
in the degree to which different mineral economies are successfully tapping&#13;
their rents, as is clearly suggested by a comparison of Indonesia, Zambia, Chile&#13;
and Peru (high rent-exaction) with Bolivia, Liberia and Zaire (low rent-&#13;
exaction).&#13;
Turning to the policy instruments recommended for the mineral economies,&#13;
the paper clearly reveals that there are two 'prices' whose influences pervade&#13;
the mineral economy, and which must receive early attention if the incentive-&#13;
wage-consumption dynamic is not to lead the mineral economy astray. These two&#13;
1/ The phrase 'incentive-wage-consumption dynamic' refers to what were found to&#13;
be typical policy responses to economic problems that most mineral economies&#13;
face early in their mineral-rent cycles. Thus, typically, the mineral economy&#13;
begins its mineral-rent cycle by permitting incentives to the domestic&#13;
production of non-mineral exports and agricultural commodities to wither away,&#13;
by allowing the mining sector wage rate to lead wages in the rest of the&#13;
economy and by increasing its incremental consumption ratio. In effect,&#13;
there is a tendency for incentives, wages and consumption to evolve as if the&#13;
mineral resources were not depletable. This has certainly been true of&#13;
Chile, Trinidad and Tobago, Oman and Congo P.R. But other mineral economies&#13;
do indicate a clear awareness of the depletable nature of their minerals and&#13;
attempt to plan for their post-mineral era, including countries such as&#13;
Algeria, Iran, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. For these latter countries one&#13;
cannot overemphasize the importance of appropriately choosing the level and&#13;
sequence of investments if these resources are to be productively used.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
prices are: (a) 'the' mining sector wage rate and (b) 'the' exchange rate. 1/&#13;
In particular, these policy tools are seen as exerting crucial influences on&#13;
saving, unemployment, inflation, agricultural production, export diversification&#13;
and, through the latter, export earnings stability. Inattention to these major&#13;
'prices' can only be perilous to the mineral economy, and hence to its objectives&#13;
of growth and transformation on the one hand, and employment and distribution on&#13;
the other. The long-term prospects of most mineral economies are bleak if an&#13;
appropriate wages policy and a carefully designed foreign trade regime are not&#13;
instituted as early as possible in the mineral-rent cycle.&#13;
A second characteristic of the recommended policy instruments is note-&#13;
worthy: apart from the two key prices noted above, they are primarily institu-&#13;
tional in nature. 2/ In a developing economy, institutional change is of the&#13;
essence. The problem is that it is much more difficult to bring about&#13;
institutional change than to modify a few prices. The task ahead is therefore a&#13;
difficult one. This can only increase the importance that must attach to the&#13;
mining wage rate and the exchange rate.&#13;
The chart (page xix) in addition to listing policy objectives and corres-&#13;
ponding policy instruments, identifies sub-groups of mineral economies to which&#13;
each of these policy objectives is most relevant, and gives country examples.&#13;
At the end of three major studies of economic policy making in Latin&#13;
America, an astute observer wrote: "in fine, the roads to reform are narrow&#13;
and perilous, they appear quite unsafe to the outside observer however sympathetic&#13;
he may be, but they exist". 3/ The success of the mineral economies in attaining&#13;
their goals rests in large measure on the size of their respective mineral reserves,&#13;
but perhaps even more importantly on whether they can tread the roads to reform&#13;
that are summarised below.&#13;
1/ High mining sector wage rates tend to render the mineral economy a high wage/&#13;
high unemployment economy (the Gulf countries are an obvious exception to the&#13;
high unemployment character of these economies, but only because international&#13;
migration is more easily controlled). The exchange rate problem in mineral&#13;
economies is that foreign exchange has a low shadow price in the short to&#13;
medium term but a much higher one in the long term, when the mineral resources&#13;
are depleted, and unless the foreign trade regime is made to reflect this&#13;
peculiar time profile of the exchange rate, the transformation of the mineral&#13;
economy is unlikely to occur. But the very pervasiveness of these two prices&#13;
is also a major reason why they are likely to be difficult instruments to use.&#13;
Throughout, policy recommendations are offered on the basis of the 'rational&#13;
actor' model of policy-making. An alternative and more realistic conceptualiza-&#13;
tion of the policy-making process is the 'incrementalist' model which recognizes,&#13;
in particular, that policy-making is plagued by uncertainty and conflict.&#13;
Although the paths of reform are narrow it is to be hoped that Hirschmanian&#13;
reform-mongers in the mineral economies will rise to the occasion. See&#13;
Lindblom (1958) and Hirschman (1973).&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
I.1   Introduction&#13;
Mention of the mineral exporting countries is likely to conjure up&#13;
images of Saudi Arabia and Kuwait on the one hand, and Zaire and 7ambia on the&#13;
other.  The first group seems embarrassed by its economic opport"..ties, and the&#13;
second appears to stumble from year to year. But such oversimplified imagery is&#13;
hazardous: one must drink deep from the Pierian spring, or not at all.&#13;
The mineral exporting countries share many developmental advantages&#13;
and problems. Their advantages derive from their possession of resources for&#13;
which demand is vigorous, and that can form the cornerstone of a development&#13;
strategy: their mineral resources, with some investment, provide a source of&#13;
rents that can finance other investments, and may in addition form the basis of&#13;
a mineral-based industrialization strategy. Their problems stem from the&#13;
depletability of these resources, the short-run instability of demand for them,&#13;
and the difficulties inherent in exacting mineral-rents. Essentially, the&#13;
depletability of their mineral resources implies that these economies must aim&#13;
to attain a diversified base as the minerals are gradually exploited. The&#13;
fundamental problem that mineral-exporting countries have to deal with is that&#13;
there is a tendency for incentives, wages and consumption to evolve as if the&#13;
mineral resources were not depletable. If this tendency is allowed to persist,&#13;
a crisis ensues when the apex of the mineral-rent cycle is attained. Short-&#13;
run demand instabilities, on the other hand, through fluctuations in export&#13;
earnings, tend to give rise to inflationary bouts in the mineral exporting&#13;
countries, and in a more direct fashion, to cycles in investment. Although&#13;
other primary-exporting countries are subject to similar fluctuations, mineral&#13;
exporting countries tend to be less diversified and hence more vulnerable.&#13;
Finally, mineral-exporting countries must successfully tap the mineral-rents&#13;
that provide their main advantage over other developing countries. This task&#13;
is necessarily complex because rents are not easily identified, vary with the&#13;
rent-exaction technique, and may even be increased through producer cooperation.&#13;
The dominance of foreign mining companies (FMCs) in the mineral sectors of most&#13;
of these countries implies that untapped rents tend to migrate to other shores.&#13;
These then are the concerns of this paper. Our discussion of these&#13;
concerns will proceed in three stages. Throughout, the ultimate objectives&#13;
are to assess the implications of these characteristics for the development&#13;
objectives of the mineral exporting countries, and to suggest ways in which&#13;
they may best exploit their advantages. Section II focuses on the advantages&#13;
and problems of the mineral exporting countries relative to the other middle-&#13;
income countries; in particular, it addresses the short- and medium-term&#13;
problems that arise from the peculiar incentive-wage-consumption dynamic of&#13;
the mineral exporting countries, and from the instability of their export&#13;
earnings. Within the group of mineral-exporting countries, the distinction&#13;
between petroleum exporters and non-fuel mineral exporters is emphasized. In&#13;
Section III, a closer look is taken at the mineral exporting countries. The&#13;
emphasis is on the long-run diversification of their economies, and distinctions&#13;
are drawn between high-capital, moderate-capital and low-capital mineral&#13;
exporting countries, and between those in the early, middle and late stages of&#13;
&#13;

exploitation of their mineral reserves. This differentiation of the mineral&#13;
exporting countries permits us to assess their investment priorities, and to&#13;
discuss their long-term prospects. Section IV treats problems associated with&#13;
the exaction of mineral rents, and in particular discusses the taxation of FMCs&#13;
and the exaction of monopolistic rents through producer cooperation. Section V&#13;
pulls together the policy recommendations offered in the preceding sections.&#13;
The rest of this section is addressed first to defining the group of mineral&#13;
exporting countries, second to assessing the implications for the mineral&#13;
exporting countries of the historical record on export-led development, and&#13;
third to describing some salient institutional features of the mining industry&#13;
and their consequences.&#13;
1.2   The Mineral Economies&#13;
The term 'mineral economies' is meant to capture those developing&#13;
countries in which the high share of mineral 1/ production in GDP and of mineral&#13;
exports in total exports render the mineral sector the keystone of the economy.&#13;
In order not to exclude those countries in which the mineral sector is declining&#13;
and yet continues to play a pivotal role, some discretion is used in our choice&#13;
of countries, although the guiding thresholds are: 10 percent of GDP (1967-75)&#13;
and 40 percent of export earnings (1973-76). Our group of mineral economies&#13;
comprises 28 countries, of which 15 are petroleum exporters and 13 are non-fuel&#13;
mineral exporters. Table 1 lists these countries, and gives their shares of&#13;
mining in GDP and mineral exports in total exports. In general, countries with&#13;
populations under 1 million are excluded; however, Gabon and Guyana are&#13;
included because they are small, non-Middle Eastern countries that have high&#13;
mineral reserves per capita.&#13;
The development objectives of the mineral economies, like those of&#13;
the other developing countries, are to sustain high growth rates; to meet the&#13;
distributional aim of alleviating poverty, both absolute and relative; and to&#13;
generate productive employment for their working populations. In addition, a&#13;
fourth objective is often emphasized: that of transition from a mineral&#13;
dependent to a highly diversified modern economy. These proximate objectives&#13;
lead, of course, to the ultimate objective of improving the living standards of&#13;
their populations. In discussing the long-term prospects of the mineral&#13;
economies, frequent reference will be made to the productive employment objective.&#13;
This is because it is seen as the key to the other objectives, all of which&#13;
follow from an optimization of productive employment opportunities. The transi-&#13;
tion objective also receives prominence in what follows because the special&#13;
advantage of the mineral economies - their potential access to mineral rents -&#13;
makes possible a more rapid transformation of their economies. 2/&#13;
1/ Minerals are defined here to include: bauxite, copper, iron-ore, lead,&#13;
manganese ore, petroleum, phospate rock, tin and zinc.&#13;
2/ One additional comment may be made: in the phrase 'development problems', the&#13;
word 'problems' presumes a prior choice of goals, and refers to the difficulties&#13;
encountered in attaining them. Also implicit is the availability of a given&#13;
configuration of resources for the attainment of these goals. A number of&#13;
problems that frustrate some of the mineral economies arise from a choice of&#13;
goals, that is seen to be wildly at variance with the resources they have at&#13;
hand, or can muster over time. This is particularly so for some of the low-&#13;
capital group of mineral economies whose saving performance and investment&#13;
priorities would seem to be based on an unrealistic assessment of their mineral&#13;
reserves per capita. In some instances, problems can only be solved by a re-&#13;
definition of goals.&#13;

I.3   Some Conjectures Based on the Hist6tic&amp;l Record&#13;
The role of foreign trade in the process of economic development has&#13;
been much debated since the late forties. To oversimplify, the line may be&#13;
drawn between economists who upheld the traditional role of primary exports as&#13;
a leading sector in development and those who deprecated the dynamic potential&#13;
of such exports and espoused in its place import substitution and balanced&#13;
growth. There can be no correct general position in this debate since countries&#13;
in the process of development are so diverse. However, an attempt at under-&#13;
standing the development problems of mineral economies inevitably leads one to&#13;
ask: 1/ what does the historical record on export-led growth suggest about&#13;
whether and how development can be transmitted to the domestic economy?&#13;
An assessment of export-led growth may be pursued from at least two&#13;
angles. The production function approach or "staple theory" approach 2/&#13;
focuses analysis not so much on the export industry itself as on the effects of&#13;
staple production on the rest of the economy. The production function for the&#13;
staple is important because secondary and tertiary industry can possibly develop&#13;
around the export base through the external effects of inputs demanded, outputs&#13;
supplied, consumer markets created, and education provided or stimulated by the&#13;
export industry. Many attempts have been made to define and classify the types&#13;
of externalities and linkages surrounding export activities, of which the most&#13;
general distinguishes between production, consumption and fiscal linkages. 3/&#13;
Whatever the mode chosen for analyzing externalities, both theoretical and&#13;
empirical work have shown that the range of strengths they may possess go all&#13;
the way from negligible to vast. 4/&#13;
If, as has been argued, a comparative appraisal of the existence,&#13;
strength, and reliability of the various linkage effects for different staples&#13;
in various socio-economic settings is one way of understanding the period of&#13;
export-led growth, 5/ what may one say about the mineral economies? There are&#13;
two major conclusions to be drawn. The first is that most studies in which the&#13;
1/ A major premise here is that the mineral economies may be regarded as part&#13;
of a larger sample of primary exporting countries, namely the now-developed&#13;
non-European countries of the nineteenth century, and other primary&#13;
exporting countries of the present century. Although such a viewpoint is&#13;
debatable on numerous grounds, it is justified if, as is the purpose here,&#13;
it is used as a heuristic device.&#13;
2/ The "staple theory" approach was pioneered by Innis in his study of Canadian&#13;
economic development; see Watkins (1963). It has since been applied by&#13;
Baldwin (1963), Roemer (1970) and others.&#13;
3/ Hirschman (1977).&#13;
4/ Caves (1965).&#13;
5/ Hirschman, op. cit.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
staple theory is extended to mining suggest that, unlike other historical staples,&#13;
the mining industry has been notably deficient in the sort of spread effects&#13;
arising from production and consumption linkages. 1/ The simplest explanation&#13;
for the failure of mining activity to generate production linkages is that its&#13;
technology is generally highly capital- and skill-intensive and hence has input&#13;
requirements that are highly divergent from domestic factor supplies; while the&#13;
failure of consumption linkages to arise is attributable to the low labor demand&#13;
generally implied by mining technology. 2/ Not surprisingly, mining has only&#13;
been generative of such spread effects where it has been carried out by small-&#13;
scale, independent miners with indigenous technology, as in Malaysia. 3/ Even so,&#13;
given the scale of such activity, these spread effects were hardly significant&#13;
for the economy as a whole.&#13;
The second conclusion of the study of linkages in mining is that fiscal&#13;
linkages make a strong showing in mineral economies. This is perhaps not a&#13;
coincidence. For it is precisely because of this absence of links that the&#13;
enclave becomes an obvious and comparatively easy target of the fiscal authorities:&#13;
fiscal linkages are usually associated with the lack of production and consumption&#13;
linkages, and vice versa. 4/&#13;
The difference between production and consumption linkages on the one&#13;
hand, and fiscal linkage on the other, is critical: the former share an&#13;
automaticity that is glaringly absent in fiscal linkage. 5/ Production and con-&#13;
sumption linkages work themselves out through the market, assuming the social&#13;
milieu and the policy environment are supportive. But the success of the fiscal&#13;
linkage depends on the willingness and ability of governments to tax or otherwise&#13;
participate in the incomes originating in mining; and in addition, the ability&#13;
to tax must be combined with an ability to invest productively. It is in this&#13;
lack of automaticity that the major weakness of fiscal linkage lies. It may&#13;
further be argued that the tasks taken on by governments through fiscal linkage&#13;
1/ See Baldwin (1966) and Fry and Harvey (1974) for Zambia; Reynolds (1965) for&#13;
Chile; Mikesell (1974) for Zaire; Pearson (1970) and Meyer and Pearson (1974)&#13;
for Nigeria; Killick (1974) for Sierra Leone; Wells (1971) for Saudi Arabia,&#13;
Bartsch (1971) for Iran; and Harris (1971) for Venezuela.&#13;
2/ Thus, the mineral economies may be distinguished from the agricultural primary&#13;
exporters; for in the latter group, production and consumption linkages can,&#13;
if allowed to, dominate the fiscal linkage; whether or not they do lead to&#13;
export-led development depends of course on the social milieu and policy&#13;
environment (see below).&#13;
3/ Thoburn (1977).&#13;
4/ Hirschman, op. cit.&#13;
5/ It is primarily in this respect that the miperal economies differ from other&#13;
primary producing countries: the configuration of linkages is vastly&#13;
different in economies dominated by export agriculture.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
are often intrinsically more difficult than those that are assumed, frequently by&#13;
private capital, in conjunction with production and consumption linkages.&#13;
Thus, an assessment of export-led growth in the mineral economies, judged&#13;
from the staple theory angle, suggests that these economies must rely primarily on&#13;
the fiscal linkage. The dominance of the fiscal linkage, characterized as it is by&#13;
a lack of automaticity in its potential spread effects, necessarily means that the&#13;
state or government must play the leading role in charting mineral-based development.&#13;
Of course, this role may be direct (through active state participation) or indirect&#13;
(through fiscal and/or financial channels), but either way, it is a dominant role.&#13;
An evaluation of the historical record on export-led growth may, on the&#13;
other hand, be approached from a second angle; 1/ exports lead to development only&#13;
if the social milieu and policy environment are supportive. In particular, it is&#13;
argued that history suggests that trade cannot be an engine of growth, it can&#13;
only be a handmaiden of growth: the differential impact of trade on growth&#13;
across countries lies in internal factors that determine the nature and mobility&#13;
of domestic factors of production. 2/ The world of foreign trade is one of change&#13;
and to be successful countries must be able to adapt the structure of their foreign&#13;
trade accordingly. The terms of trade turn against the enlarging economy that&#13;
cannot transform. 3/ Transformation, of course, does not demand shifts of the&#13;
whole economy from one task to another: the changes occur at the margin.&#13;
The essential implication of this view on export-led development is that&#13;
the success of the mineral economies will depend significantly on the quality and&#13;
mobility of their internal factors of production, and on the policy environment they&#13;
establish for economic decision-making. Together,these two sets of factors will&#13;
determine their capacity to transform as their mineral rents wither away or as&#13;
demand for their mineral decreases. In particular, the older mineral economies&#13;
may not have benefited from the impulses from their mineral exports because these&#13;
internal and policy factors were inhibiting. Such was the case, for example, with&#13;
Peruvian guano and Chilean nitrates. 4/&#13;
What conclusions emerge from the literature on export-led growth and its&#13;
causes? Put rather tersely, it may be claimed that the historical record permits&#13;
the following conjectures:&#13;
(a) Historically, successful export-led growth has, in large&#13;
measure, hinged upon the effects of staple production,&#13;
through production and consumption linkages, on the rest&#13;
of the economy.&#13;
1/ A third angle on export-led growth has been that set forth by Nurkse, namely&#13;
the trade-pessimism theory. The essence of Nurkse's argument, that for&#13;
various reasons the prospects for exports of primary products to the&#13;
developed countries are poor, is least applicable to minerals and is therefore&#13;
not pursued here.&#13;
2/ Kravis (1970).&#13;
3/ Linder (1961), Kindleberger (1962 , 1964).&#13;
4/ Levin (1960).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(b)   Production and consumption linkages are, however, not&#13;
necessary conditions for export-led development. In&#13;
principle, fiscal linkage, whic; 'ends to predominate&#13;
where the other linkages are absent, provides an alter-&#13;
native route to growth.&#13;
(c)   Neither production and consumption linkages on the oie&#13;
hand, nor the fiscal linkage on the other, are sufficient&#13;
conditions for export-led growth: internal factors (the&#13;
quality and mobility of factors of production), the policy&#13;
environment, and an ability to invest fiscal proceeds&#13;
productively must all play supportive roles.&#13;
(d)   The lesson from Canadian and Peruvian history is that, in&#13;
general, no single staple industry can be expected to lead&#13;
a country all the way through diversification and industria-&#13;
lization. The production and consumption linkages of a&#13;
series of vigorous staples are required before the capacity&#13;
to transform is great enough to avoid the instabilities of&#13;
an export economy. And the fiscal linkage of a single&#13;
staple is, in general, not large enough to foster the&#13;
transformation of the entire economy. Perhaps the major&#13;
exception to this view arises in the context of those post-&#13;
1973 petroleum economies whose fiscal linkage is large&#13;
enough to permit a transformation of their economies on the&#13;
basis of a single staple.&#13;
The implications of these conjectures for the study of the mineral&#13;
economies are:&#13;
(a) Since export-led development will depend primarily on the&#13;
magnitude of the fiscal linkage rather than on production&#13;
and consumption linkages, maximizing the fiscal linkage&#13;
is a critical problem for the mineral economies.&#13;
(b) Since successful export-led growth based on the fiscal&#13;
linkage rests, in large part, on the ability of the state&#13;
productively to invest its fiscal proceeds, the investment&#13;
priorities of mineral economies must be carefully chosen&#13;
if they are to exploit their mineral-rent advantage.&#13;
(c) Since export-led development is particularly responsive to&#13;
the policy environment for economic decision-making, lacunae&#13;
in the latter can only delay the transformation of the economy,&#13;
and the attainment of the growth, distribution and employment&#13;
objectives.&#13;
These implications mirror and reinforce the three main concerns of this&#13;
paper (see Section I.1), and are reflected, respectively, in Sections IV, III and&#13;

I.4   Some Salient Institutional Features df the International&#13;
Mining Industry and their Consequences&#13;
The most significant institutional features of the international mining&#13;
scene are the highly uneven geographical distribution of minerals, the great&#13;
degree of uncertainty associated with exhaustible natural resources, and the&#13;
highly capital-intensive technology of the industry.&#13;
The uneven geographical distribution of mineral reserves is indicated&#13;
by the statistical fact that 70 to 75 percent of world non-fuel mineral output&#13;
is produced in only a dozen countries, half of which are developing countries:&#13;
the Soviet Union (18.7 percent), U.S.A. (15.9 percent), Canada (11.5 percent),&#13;
Chile (4.6 percent), Zambia (4.1 percent), Australia (3.4 percent), China (3.2&#13;
percent), Zaire (2.4 percent), Peru (2.3 percent), South Africa (1.9 percent),&#13;
Mexico (1.8 percent) and Brazil (1.6 percent). The shares of the top five&#13;
producers in copper, bauxite, zinc, iron ore and nickel are 71 percent, 63 per-&#13;
cent, 59 percent, 67 percent and over 90 percent respectively. 1/&#13;
Uncertainty pervades the mining industry. The search for new deposits&#13;
has become increasingly systematized: large organizations with massive explora-&#13;
tion budgets have replaced the maverick prospector. Yet discoveries, even today,&#13;
are still sudden and unpredictable. The impact of discoveries on price, if there&#13;
is an open market for the resource, or on the plans of the organizations involved&#13;
in the trade of that resource, is likely to be dramatic. There is, in addition,&#13;
the related uncertainty regarding future technologies. Techniques for searching&#13;
for new deposits may change, or new technologies can also appear for working&#13;
known mines, thus influencing unit costs. Technical change can generate cheap&#13;
substitutes for resource inputs, as evidenced by the history of Chilean nitrates&#13;
and Peruvian guano. Economic life, of course, is full of all types of uncertainty.&#13;
The argument is that in the field of natural resources, uncertainty seems&#13;
especially great.&#13;
Similarly, economic activities also require capital and a certain&#13;
minimum scale of operations. Both the search for new deposits and their&#13;
exploitation appear to be, once again, especially capital intensive, where&#13;
capital includes physical, human and social overhead capital. Such capital&#13;
intensity plus organizational requirements in production, transportation and&#13;
marketing combine to create indivisibilities in the production and distribution&#13;
of many exhaustible natural resources. As a result, for substantial output&#13;
ranges marginal costs are considerably below average costs.&#13;
These three features of the mining industry, i.e., uneven geographical&#13;
distribution, uncertainty and capital intensity, provide much of the explanation&#13;
for a fourth feature, namely the dominance of large vertically-integrated&#13;
international firms. The uneven geographical distribution of exhaustible&#13;
1/ Bosson and Varon (1977), pp. 85-86; based on 1968 value of world output.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
resources implies that international trade in such resources must be significant.l/&#13;
The relatively poor performance of open markets in the presence of the uncertain-&#13;
ties and complexities described above encourages the substitution of corporate&#13;
planning for open markets, and gives rise to vertically-integrated firms. And the&#13;
high capital intensity of the industry leads to an oligopolistic market structure&#13;
dominated by a few large firms. Together, these three features explain, in large&#13;
measure, the presence of large, international and vertically-integrated firms in&#13;
the mining industry, or of foreign mining companies (FMCs) in most mineral&#13;
economies. Having come into existence, such FMCs have tended to maintain the&#13;
oligopolistic structure of the industry by erecting various entry barriers. But&#13;
such barriers have been surmounted, and oligopolistic rivalry in the mineral&#13;
industry has an interesting history. 2/&#13;
There are two major consequences of these institutional features. First,&#13;
the absence of open markets for many minerals and the high degree of uncertainty&#13;
imply that the identification of economic rents, which abound in the mineral&#13;
industry, is extremely difficult for the host country governments. Since fiscal&#13;
linkages are a major spin-off from the industry, this rent-identification problem&#13;
raises the question of how best the mineral economies may tax mining activity.&#13;
The growing tendency to nationalize, or otherwise increase government participation&#13;
in, mineral industries,as well as the growing number of producers' associations,&#13;
are further responses to the rent identification problem. These issues are dealt&#13;
with at length in Section IV.&#13;
The second consequence of the dominance of FMCs in the mining industry&#13;
is that exploration and investment decisions, as well as decisions on the location&#13;
of mineral-processing plants, are often taken from the point of view of the global&#13;
strategy of these FMCs. 3/ In particular, it is argued that the capital intensity&#13;
of the industry is a response to factor prices in the home countries of the FMCs&#13;
rather than in the mineral economies; and that the concentration of mineral-&#13;
processing plants in the industrialized countries reflects the particular interests&#13;
of the FMCs (such as oligopolistic rivalry) or those of their home countries (such&#13;
as protection to domestic industries and security considerations) rather than just&#13;
the pure economics of location. The questions of producer cooperation in general,&#13;
and of industrialization strategies based on mineral-processing are addressed in&#13;
Sections IV.5 and II.3 respectively.&#13;
The preceding description of some salient features of the international&#13;
mining industry has provided some background for the discussion of the problems&#13;
that mineral economies face, and in particular has underlined the importance of&#13;
issues on our agenda of discussion: the taxation of mineral rents, increasing&#13;
government participation in the mineral industry, the increasing tendency for&#13;
producer cooperation and the economics of mineral processing in the producing&#13;
countries.&#13;

II. THE MINERAL AND NON-MINERAL ECONOMIES IN PERSPECTIVE&#13;
II.1 Introduction&#13;
The merit of a distinction between mineral and non-mineral economies&#13;
must, in the final analysis, rest on differences between their development&#13;
advantages and problems, It was claimed in Section 1.1 that the mineral&#13;
economies have specific advantages; and further that their short- and medium-&#13;
term problems stem primarily from the peculiar incentive-wage-consumption&#13;
dynamic that the discovery of minerals tends to unleash, and from short-run&#13;
instabilities in the demand for minerals. The purpose of this section is to&#13;
attempt to substantiate these claims by comparing the mineral economies to a&#13;
group of non-mineral economies.&#13;
Among the mineral economies, a distinction is drawn first between&#13;
the petroleum and the non-fuel mineral economies; the higher average earnings&#13;
of the former group necessitate such a division. Secondly, two other sub-sets&#13;
of the mineral economies are distinguished: Sample I excludes Indonesia and&#13;
Morocco from the universal set of mineral economies identified earlier (because&#13;
these two economies have a more diversified production base than other mineral&#13;
economies) while Sample II excludes Guinea and Zaire (the two lowest income&#13;
countries in the group). The non-mineral economies may be defined in two&#13;
possible ways: first, in a residual fashion, as all middle-income developing&#13;
countries other than the mineral economies; or second, in a more particularistic&#13;
fashion, by choosing a reference group of non-mineral exporting countries for&#13;
each group of mineral economies with otherwise similar long-term comparative&#13;
advantages. By this latter criterion, one would compare Zambia and Zaire to,say,&#13;
Tanzania and Malawi; Algeria and Morocco to, say, Tunisia; Saudi Arabia and&#13;
Kuwait to, say, Yemen Arab Republic and Yemen, PDR. The residual definition&#13;
of non-mineral economies is chosen on the grounds that any a priori reason for&#13;
using non-mineral economies as a standard of comparison is more defensible for&#13;
an income-related definition. Although the mining sector remains in many ways&#13;
an enclave par excellence, its direct and indirect effects on incentives, wages&#13;
and consumption in the rest of the economy render the mineral economy very&#13;
different from non-mineral economies with otherwise similar characteristics.&#13;
Thus, for the rest of this paper, non-mineral economies are defined as all&#13;
middle-income developing countries (i.e., with 1976 per capita GNP of US$260&#13;
or more) other than the mineral economies. 1/&#13;
The major arguments of this section may be stated quite succinctly.&#13;
First, in general terms, it is argued that the mineral economies enjoy two&#13;
important advantages over the non-mineral economies: (a) unlike many other&#13;
developing countries, the mineral economies generally are not as burdened&#13;
with fiscal and foreign exchange gaps; and (b) unlike many other developing&#13;
countries whose choice of an industrialization strategy is largely restricted&#13;
to import substitution, exports of labor-intensive manufactures and basic&#13;
goods production, 2/ mineral economies (like other resource economies) have&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
the added option of resource-based industrialization.&#13;
It is argued, on the other hand, that in comparison with the non-&#13;
mineral econor'es, there is evidence to support the view that mineral economies&#13;
do perform poorly in (a) agricultural growth (b) export diversification and&#13;
(c) inflation; and the view that there is a tendency for these economies to be&#13;
characterized by (d) lower incremental saving ratios, (e) higher technological and&#13;
wage dualism, higher unemployment and lower school enrollment ratios, (f) higher&#13;
external debt-to-GNP ratios, and (g) higher export earnings instability. 1/&#13;
II2 Fiscal and Foreign Exchange Ease&#13;
In development planning, few ideas have received as much attention&#13;
as the constraints imposed by saving, fiscal and foreign exchange gaps. These&#13;
gaps depend, of course, on the planned growth rate and on the allowed adjusting&#13;
variables. The principal argument here is that mineral economies are less likely&#13;
to be subject to the fiscal and/or foreign exchange gaps for a reasonable range&#13;
of growth rates, at least while their mineral reserves last. (Saving in mineral&#13;
economies is discussed in II.4 below.)&#13;
The essential advantage of the mineral economies, in comparison with&#13;
other developing countries engaged in other forms of primary production, lies&#13;
in their possession of a resource that, often in conjunction with foreign&#13;
investors, is more easily converted into a financial flow. This financial&#13;
flow, which principally represents the rent element that the mineral economy&#13;
is able to tap, is usually generated as fiscal revenue, in the form of foreign&#13;
exchange. The mineral economies' relatively easy access to this flow of fiscal&#13;
revenue in the form of foreign exchange arises principally because, (a) unlike&#13;
the agricultural primary producers, the mineral economies export products with&#13;
high income elasticities of demand; and (b) taxes on the mining sector, which&#13;
is foreign-owned and easily identified, are easier to levy 2/ and to administer.&#13;
The upshot of these advantages is that fiscal and foreign exchange gaps are less&#13;
likely to constrain investment in mineral than in non-mineral economies.&#13;
1/ The distinction between mineral and non-mineral economies is two-pronged:&#13;
first, there are structural differences that arise from the particular&#13;
nature of the mining industry--namely, the relative importance of the&#13;
fiscal linkage, fiscal and foreign exchange ease, the resource-based&#13;
industrialization option, the exhaustible nature of the resource, the&#13;
dominance of FMCs in the industry and the large rent component in the&#13;
market value of minerals; second, there are hypothesized differences&#13;
in performance which follow both from the structural features mentioned&#13;
above and from typical policy responses to these. These latter hypotheses&#13;
are subjected to tests below; but only superficially so. A thorough&#13;
statistical test would require that for each dependent variable we&#13;
demonstrate a statistical difference between the structural equations&#13;
for mineral and non-mineral economies. Time constraints have made this&#13;
impracticable.&#13;

The evidence on the relative ease of access to fiscal and foreign&#13;
exchange resources is summarised in Table II. The greater access to foreign&#13;
exchange resources shared by the mineral economies is abundantly clear: the&#13;
export earnings to GDP ratio is about twice as large in these economies than&#13;
in the non-mineral economies. The evidence for fiscal ease shows the mineral&#13;
economies to have a tax to GDP ratio about one and one half times that of the&#13;
non-mineral economies. 1/ However, this is an instance in which the middle-&#13;
income definition of non-mineral economies is somewhat misleading, since one&#13;
could expect the efficiency of a country's tax administration to be correlated&#13;
more with the general level of development than with per capita income per se.&#13;
Some comparisons of individual countries make the point clearly: Zambia's,&#13;
Gabon's, Congo P.R.'s and Zaire's tax revenue/GDP ratios average 27, 19.5, 20&#13;
and 25 percent respectively (1968-73), while those for Cameroon, Ghana, Ivory&#13;
Coast and Sudan average 15, 15.1, 20.1 and 14.3 respectively; Trinidad and&#13;
Tobago, Jamaica and Guyana had tax ratios, over the same period, of 15, 17.5&#13;
and 21 percent respectively, while Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama,&#13;
Paraguay and Colombia had tax ratios of 7.8, 10.6, 9.0, 11.5, 10.0 and 8.1&#13;
respectively; finally, Saudi Arabia had an average tax ratio of 30 percent&#13;
while Egypt's tax ratio, over the same period, averaged 14.5 percent.&#13;
However, these advantages are not unmixed blessings. The share of&#13;
government revenue (Table III) and of income and foreign exchange (Table I)&#13;
that arises in the mining sector is often so high that short-run demand&#13;
instabilities tend to generate corresponding instabilities in foreign&#13;
exchange earnings and in fiscal revenue. The recent experience of the&#13;
copper producing countries is a classic example. In this respect, mineral&#13;
economies come close to other countries that are highly dependent on exports&#13;
of one or a few commodities. This dependence calls first for astute short-&#13;
run macro-economic management, and in the longer run, for a diversification&#13;
of the economy and a widening of the tax base. These policy objectives are&#13;
dealt with in II.6 and II.9 respectively.&#13;
I1.3 Resource-based Industrialization 2/&#13;
Of the four strategies of industrialization that are being under-&#13;
taken by or advocated for the developing countries, namely import-substitution,&#13;
exports of labor-intensive manufacturing, primary export processing and basic&#13;
goods production, the latter two are based on the domestic processing of&#13;
natural resources, including minerals. The principal argument of this sub-&#13;
section is that although the mineral economies, perhaps to a greater extent&#13;
than other primary product exporting countries, have the option of pursuing&#13;
a resource-based industrialization (RBI) strategy, it is not obvious that RBI&#13;

enterprises.&#13;

is better suited to achieve the goals of growth, distribution and employment&#13;
than other potential strategies. The contribution of RBI to each of these&#13;
goals must be assessed. Although often advocated as if its appropriateness&#13;
is unquestionable, resource-based industrial projects must, like all other&#13;
projects, be subject to the cost-benefit calculus.&#13;
It is well known that mineral processing facilities are heavily&#13;
concentrated in the industrialized countries; only about 30 percent of the&#13;
minerals (including petroleum) mined in the developing countries is processed&#13;
there. Moreover, this ratio has remained relatively constant over the past&#13;
two decades, suggesting that increases in processing facilities in these&#13;
countries have merely met increases in mine capacity. 1/ While mining must&#13;
by necessity be carried out where deposits exist, mineral-processing is more&#13;
foot-loose.&#13;
Various reasons may be adduced for the concentration of mineral&#13;
processing in the industrialized countries: in several minerals, the developed&#13;
countries used to be major producers and built up processing facilities at home&#13;
(lead, zinc, iron ore, copper and bauxite); their tariff structure has tended&#13;
to favor imports of unprocessed products; mineral-processing requires large&#13;
capital investments and is subject to high economies of scale; some mineral-&#13;
processing activities are technologically highly sophisticated and require&#13;
highly skilled labor; and finally, in some products proximity to consumers&#13;
is a distinct advantage, while in others, the supply of complementary inputs&#13;
determines location.&#13;
However, other factors also favor expanded mineral-processing&#13;
activities in the producing countries. The potential contribution of&#13;
mineral processing to the mineral economies may be discussed in terms of&#13;
comparative advantage, economies of scale, external economies, and employ-&#13;
ment and income distribution.&#13;
Comparative Advantage: In general, there are few data to support comparative&#13;
advantage in mineral processing on the basis of lower labor costs: of all the&#13;
mineral-based industries, only primary metal processing is labor intensive and&#13;
of median capital intensity. Capital costs on the other hand are a high frac-&#13;
tion in all mineral processing except aluminum fabrication, averaging around&#13;
40 per cent or more of total costs. Thus, if capital abundance were the sole&#13;
criterion, only the highly capital-abundant mineral economies would possess a&#13;
comparative advantage in processing. Raw material costs too are high for all&#13;
mineral-based industries except aluminum, and this indicates that considerable&#13;
importance attaches to the saving of material-related costs such as transport&#13;
and handling costs. Finally, the presence of critical complementary inputs&#13;
may confer a comparative advantage: for example, natural gas and hydropower&#13;
for aluminum smelting.&#13;

Economies of Scale: Almost all industries based on natural resources are&#13;
subject to economies of scale. The important mineral economies produce&#13;
volumes of their minerals well in excess of the minimum required output;&#13;
this is true for the six leading copper exporters, the four major bauxite&#13;
exporters and all major petroleum exporters. In each of these cases., the&#13;
limitations are imposed by the ability of exporters to market the refined&#13;
output. This constraint is particularly severe in the highly integrated&#13;
aluminum and petroleum markets, and to a lesser extent in copper. Yet,&#13;
for all but the very large mineral economies, a part of their processed&#13;
output would have to be exported if scale economies are to be attained.&#13;
External Economies: Perhaps the most important but oversold argument for&#13;
RBI is the external economies one. Simply stated, it stresses the importance&#13;
of production linkages in the mineral processing industries. The linkage&#13;
from ore-mining through smelting, refining, fabrication of metal products,&#13;
and finally into capital goods, is pivotal to the basic goods industrializa-&#13;
tion strategy. The critical role of steel in industrial development is&#13;
argued on the basis of the latter series of linkages. Linkages based on&#13;
cheap natural gas are being exploited in the industrialization of many&#13;
petroleum economies: these linkages extend from natural gas as a raw&#13;
material for fertilizer, petrochemicals and sponge-iron to gas as a cheap&#13;
source of power for smelting aluminum.    Finally, the linkage argument for&#13;
RBI receives its greatest support in a recent study in which a calculation&#13;
of indices of toal production linkage (direct and indirect, forward and&#13;
backward) for 18 sectors showed that basic metals have the second highest&#13;
index, while chemicals, petroleum refining, metal products and machinery&#13;
had above-median scores. 1/&#13;
Employment: Labor-intensity in mining activity and in mineral-based&#13;
processing is so low as to make these activities at least on a direct&#13;
basis,very low in employment generation. For example, it is estimated&#13;
that in Colombia, each US$100 million of investment in petrochemicals&#13;
employed only 2,500 in 1967, whilst the same funds invested in labor-&#13;
intensive industries would have provided 50,000 jobs. 2/ When both direct&#13;
and indirect employment effects are allowed for, fertilizer and petroleum-&#13;
refining score better, but other direct evidence conflicts with even these&#13;
results. 3/ Thus assuming fixed factor proportions, most mineral-based&#13;
industries simply do not offer much scope for employment creation. Nor&#13;
does there seem to be much scope for factor substitution to increase&#13;
employment coefficients in these industries. Worse still, the employment&#13;
implications of these industries go beyond themselves: they give rise to&#13;
high wage enclaves which encourage high open unemployment and migration&#13;
(see Section III.5).&#13;

Income Distribution: With very few employees who receive high wages, most&#13;
mineral-based industries tend to increase the income concentration of the&#13;
already dualistic economies. A recent study 1/ identified natural resource&#13;
abundance and dualism as two of the most critical variables (of 31 tested)&#13;
in determining income distribution, both leading to greater concentration.&#13;
The average share of income accruing to the top 5 percent of the population&#13;
is 50 percent higher for 26 resource-abundant countries than for 17 less well&#13;
endowed countries. 2/ But if the resource-based industries are introduced&#13;
into an economy that is already characterized by dualism due to a mining&#13;
enclave and to a highly protected import-substitution sector, the former&#13;
should not take the full blame. Nor is RBI likely to break such a pattern&#13;
if it already exists. There is, in fact, some evidence to suggest that&#13;
income distribution is largely insensitive to industrial structure or&#13;
industrial policy regimes. 3/ It may be noted that RBI could improve&#13;
regional distribution since such industries tend to be located near the&#13;
mines, which themselves are often in some of the least developed regions&#13;
of the mineral economies.&#13;
An Assessment: The upshot of the above strategies is that subject to the&#13;
entry barriers issue discussed below, RBI in the mineral economies receive&#13;
their strongest a priori support on the basis of (a) the raw material cost&#13;
shares of such industries; (b) comparative advantage arguments for the more&#13;
capital-abundant of the mineral economies such as Saudi Arabia, and Libya&#13;
and for countries that are abundant in critical complementary inputs such&#13;
as Algeria, Nigeria (natural gas) and Zaire (hydropower) for aluminum smelting;&#13;
and (c) external economy arguments where there is high potential for produc-&#13;
tion linkages in basic metals, chemicals, petroleum refining, metal products&#13;
and machinery.&#13;
On the other hand, it is clear that the total employment effects of&#13;
RBI would in general perpetuate the already dualistic character of most&#13;
mineral economies, leading perhaps to more (open) unemployment, rural-urban&#13;
migration and doing little or nothing to improve income distribution.&#13;
To decide whether such arguments favor RBI for specific minerals&#13;
in specific countries, these general propositions must be combined to produce&#13;
a single-dimensional indicator. Few studies provide such an analysis on a&#13;
comparative basis, using the multiple objectives we have stressed above.&#13;
The most reliable of the few comparative studies that have attempted to&#13;
assess the value added picture for specific mineral-based processing 4/&#13;
concluded that of the seven major non-fuel minerals, this criterion favored&#13;
the processing of bauxite, copper, iron-ore and to a lesser extent, zinc,&#13;

while it disfavored both lead and nickel; the prospects for tin, on the other&#13;
hand, are poor because of the world's excess tin smelting capacity. The&#13;
preceding table summarizes this evidence.&#13;
This evidence clearly indicates that even for minerals which pass&#13;
the value-added test, entry barriers are a major stumbling block. These&#13;
include tariffs and other import barriers in the developed countries, the&#13;
market power exercised by shipping conferences that can set rates to&#13;
discriminate against the processed commodity, and perhaps most importantly,&#13;
oligopolistic market structures that prevent market entry. These raise&#13;
policy issues related to producer cooperation and to the regulation of FMCs&#13;
which are dealt with in Section IV.&#13;
In the final analysis, then, RBI is defensible only if it satisfies&#13;
some combination of direct value-added and potential linkage effects. 1/&#13;
Its low demand for labor implies that it can be the sole industrialization&#13;
strategy only for highly capital-abundant countries with small populations,&#13;
such as Kuwait, Libya and Gabon, and even in these economies only if complemen-&#13;
tary investments are made in education, training, and research and development.&#13;
For the moderate- or low-capital mineral economies, and in particular for the&#13;
larger mineral economies, import substitution and development of labor-&#13;
intensive manfuactures for export are likely to be integral components of&#13;
their industrialization strategies. This issue is discussed in greater&#13;
detail in Section III.&#13;
II.4 Macro-economic Consumption-Investment Choices&#13;
It is often claimed that mineral economies are characterized by&#13;
consumption standards that assume that their mineral rents have an infinite&#13;
time-horizon rather than a medium-term one. 2/ On the realistic assumption&#13;
that such mineral rents first increase and then gradually decline over time,&#13;
such consumption behavior would clearly not be prudent, let alone optimal.&#13;
Investments made during the lifetime of the mineral should clearly be such&#13;
as to substitute an equivalent or larger flow of income as the rents wither&#13;
away. A test of the hypothesis that the mineral economies' consumption is&#13;
too high is rather difficult, not least because a given country's mineral&#13;
reserves may increase over time as prices and technology change and as&#13;
exploration proceeds. 3/ Mineral prices may change over time for similar&#13;
1/ A third argument favoring RBI is that it is an instrument for exacting&#13;
mineral rents. The rent-exaction problem and other approaches to it are&#13;
discussed in Section IV.&#13;
2/ There is also interview evidence that suggests that many petroleum economies&#13;
are acutely aware of the medium-term nature of their mineral rent cycles,&#13;
and the need therefore to invest these 'temporary' rent flows productively.&#13;
This is so in particular for Saudi Arabia, Kuwait,Iran and Algeria. See&#13;
The Economist, May 17, 1975, pp. 57-62, August 9, 1975, p. 67.&#13;
3/ The uncertainties associated with sea-bed mining put the point across rather&#13;
graphically,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
reasons, and possibly also as a result of market interventions and changes&#13;
in market structure. To add to the complications, different mineral economies&#13;
are on different mineral-rent cycles, and in different stages of their res-&#13;
pective cycles. In the face of such complications, our simple comparison of&#13;
the macro-economic consumption-investment choices made by mineral and non-&#13;
mineral economies can only be suggestive in nature. Even so, it does consti-&#13;
tute a simple test of the hypothesis. 1/ 2/&#13;
Table IVa below compares the mean gross national saving rates for&#13;
the mineral and non-mineral economies, and in the former group, for the petro-&#13;
leum and non-fuel mineral economies. The evidence is somewhat mixed. Gross&#13;
national saving rates, on the average, are higher in the mineral economies&#13;
than in the non-mineral economies: in 1968, the respective rates were 20.4&#13;
and 13.5 percent and had risen by 1976 to 26.5 and 16.2 percent respectively.&#13;
However, disaggregation reveals that the saving performance of non-fuel mineral&#13;
economies has been deteriorating: in 1968, these economies had a higher gross&#13;
national saving rate than the non-mineral economies, but have more recently&#13;
(1973-76), fallen behind the latter. The evidence would seem to suggest that&#13;
the hypothesis may be true for the non-fuel mineral economies.&#13;
Further evidence on saving in the mineral and non-mineral economies&#13;
is provided in Table IVb which compares incremental saving ratios for the two&#13;
groups.   The distinction between the two sets of economies is no longer as&#13;
clear as it was above: the non-mineral economies had an incremental saving&#13;
rate of 23.6 percent over 1968-70, but this has since fallen to 13.8 percent&#13;
for 1973-76, while the mineral economies,which had a 1968-70 rate lower than&#13;
that of the non-mineral economies (13.7 percent),have since increased their&#13;
rate to 24.2 percent.&#13;
1/ In principle, the consumption-investment split depends, of course, on the&#13;
social rate of time preference and on the rate of return on investment.&#13;
There is much to be said for the argument that the social rate of time&#13;
preference must be quite high in the petroleum economies, but clearly&#13;
not in the non-fuel mineral economies.&#13;
2/ It is worth noting however that there is already some evidence that provides&#13;
indirect support for the above hypothesis. In a number of studies in recent&#13;
years, the effect of foreign aid and capital inflows on the behavior of&#13;
national saving rates has been analyzed. These studies suggest that a&#13;
considerable portion of such capital inflows has in fact been allocated&#13;
to consumption. It would not be surprising then to observe that the&#13;
onset of a foreign resource inflow in new mineral economies, or sudden&#13;
increases in these inflows as in 1973 in the petroleum economies and&#13;
during export booms in the non-fuel mineral economies, lead to increased&#13;
consumption-income ratios. See Griffin and Enos [1970], Weisskopf [1972].&#13;

The disaggregated figures reveal that the improvement in the saving&#13;
performance of t0e mineral economies over the 1968-76 period solely reflects&#13;
the performance in the petroleum economies: although their incremental saving&#13;
rate was lower than that of the non-mineral economies during 1968-70, it has&#13;
since risen to account for the entire difference between the saving performances&#13;
of the mineral and non-mineral economies. Saving in the non-fuel mineral&#13;
economies has shown little change over the 1968-76 period, but despite the&#13;
fall in the non-mineral economies, still compares unfavorably with that in&#13;
the latter group of countries.&#13;
Table IVa and IVb therefore clearly show that consumption accounts&#13;
for a higher share of income in the non-fuel mineral economies than in other&#13;
economies. There is also some indication that saving performance in the petro-&#13;
leum economies may also have been inferior to that in the non-mineral economies&#13;
but for recent oil-price increases: the 1968-70 incremental saving rate is&#13;
lower for the former than for the latter. 1/ At any rate, subject to further&#13;
testing, it is neither possible to accept nor to reject the hypothesis for the&#13;
petroleum economies.&#13;
Table V below presents the results of a final test of the hypothesis&#13;
under consideration. It aims to assess the relative saving performance of the&#13;
petroleum economies in particular, and to provide some information on the&#13;
variance of average saving rates for the groups of economies under consideration.&#13;
It uses as a benchmark the "norm" Saving-GNP ratios that emerge from the Chenery-&#13;
Syrquin cross-country saving equation, 2/ and presents for each group, (a) the&#13;
mean absolute deviation of actual from "norm" saving rates, and (b) the propor-&#13;
tion of below "norm" saving rates. The former index measures the degree to&#13;
which, on average, the saving performance of the group varies from what it&#13;
would have been if each country in the group were to save "normally" (allowing&#13;
for its income per capita and population). The second index gives a measure&#13;
of the degree to which the group's variance is characterized by saving rates&#13;
superior or inferior to the "norm" (hence, the lower this index, the better&#13;
the saving performance relative to the "norm").&#13;
The evidence in Table V suggests a number of conclusions. First,&#13;
it clearly supports the view that saving behavior of the mineral economies as&#13;
a group differs significantly from that in the non-mineral economies as a&#13;
group, since the variation around the "norm" is twice as high in the former&#13;
than in the latter. Also, since this order of magnitude persisted between&#13;
1968 and 1976, the evidence also suggests that no changes along the above&#13;
dimensions occurred in this period.&#13;
1/ It is important to note that the improvement in the saving performance of&#13;
the petroleum economies follows the oil price level which increased between&#13;
1970 and 1973 from $1.80 to $3.30 per barrel, and in 1974 to $11.59.&#13;
2/ See Chenery and Syrquin [1975], Chapter 2, especially pp. 21-23. The&#13;
independent variables in the equation are GNP per capita, population and&#13;
a time trend. Thus, given any country, one can compute its "norm" saving-&#13;
ratio using its GNP per capita and its population.&#13;

Secondly, to the credit of the mineral economies, the evidence&#13;
suggests that they have, as a group, not wasted their mineral-rent advantage:&#13;
for both years, the proportion of below "norm" saving performances is much&#13;
lower in the mineral economies than in the non-mineral economies.&#13;
However, it is clear that the proportion of below "norm" savers&#13;
among the mineral economies has increased over the period, while for the&#13;
non-mineral economies it has remained the same.   And what is more, the new&#13;
class of low savers among the mineral economies are all non-fuel economies.&#13;
The third conclusion that we may draw from these facts then is that the&#13;
saving record of the non-fuel mineral economies has been rapidly deteriorating&#13;
in recent years; so much so, in fact, that in 1976, the proportion of below&#13;
"norm" savers in this group was equal to that for the non-mineral economies.&#13;
As a group therefore, the non-fuel mineral economies seem in recent years to&#13;
have totally wasted their mineral-rent advantage! It is instructive to cite&#13;
those countries in this group which have below "norm" saving rates: in 1968,&#13;
Chile, Peru and Morocco; and in 1976, Chile, Peru, Morocco, as well as&#13;
Bolivia, Guinea, Jamaica and Sierra Leone.&#13;
Finally, the evidence suggests that the petroleum economies have&#13;
by far the best saving record of all the groups considered here, if their&#13;
respective "norms" are used as the measuring rod. Their performance as a&#13;
group has, not surprisingly, improved substantially between 1968 and 1976,&#13;
the below "norm" proportion having fallen from 35 to 21 percent. In 1968,&#13;
the below "norm" petroleum economies were Syria, Iran and Indonesia, while&#13;
in 1976, they were Syria, Kuwait and the Congo P.D.R. Much as this evidence&#13;
suggests an impressive saving record for the petroleum economies as a group,&#13;
it must be borne in mind that the measuring rod is a debatable one for these&#13;
economies, given their post-1973 quantum leap in mineral rents. The conclu-&#13;
sion has to be therefore that it is possible neither to accept nor reject&#13;
the high consumption hypothesis for these economies.&#13;
It is of particular significance that throughout this section,&#13;
the control group of non-mineral economies is chosen on the basis of per&#13;
capita incomes. For among the many suggested determinants of savings,&#13;
that which receives unambiguous empirical support is income. 1/ The&#13;
relevance of the control group for the purpose at hand is certainly not&#13;
ideal, but it does offer some standard of comparison.&#13;
The general policy implications of the poor saving performance&#13;
of the non-fuel mineral economies are clear, although they may vary for&#13;
individual countries. In particular, national saving is likely to be&#13;
influenced by the functional distribution of income between wages and&#13;
other forms of income (see Section II.5), by the level and structure of&#13;
interest rates, by the rate of inflation (see Section II.6), by the effi-&#13;
ciency of the financial institutions, and not least,, by the saving perfor-&#13;
mance of the public sector. To the extent that saving performance reflects&#13;
the influence of these factors, it may be improved by:&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

(a) an incomes policy directed at controlling wages&#13;
especially in the mineral and related sectors&#13;
(Section II.5);&#13;
(b) a more progressive income tax and/or high taxes&#13;
on luxuries, both imported and domestic;&#13;
(c) policies aimed at a lower rate of inflation&#13;
(Section 11.6);&#13;
(d) a widening of the geographical and functional&#13;
coverage of the financial institutions and a&#13;
modification of the level and term-structure&#13;
of interest rates; and&#13;
(e) controlling the growth of government consumption&#13;
expenditure, particularly through the programming&#13;
of recurrent expenditure outlays associated with&#13;
capital expenditures.&#13;
These polieies must cleariy receive attenti,m in the nen-fuel&#13;
mineral economies, the sub-group for which the evidence supports the&#13;
hypothesis of low relative savings. As argued earlier, it is possible&#13;
neither to accept nor reject the low-saving hypothesis for the petroleum&#13;
economies; however, the saving performance of petroleum economies in the&#13;
low-capital group, as we shall see below, needs substantial improvement&#13;
(see Section III).&#13;
II.5 Technological and Wage Dualism, Migration and Unemployment&#13;
In reviewing the historical record on export-led growth and the&#13;
case for RBI in mineral economies, attention was drawn to the technological&#13;
dualism that characterizes the mineral economies: an enclave, after all, is&#13;
defined by its distinctiveness from its environment. This characteristic is&#13;
well documented and does not therefore call for much substantiation here.&#13;
Except in the very early stages of mining when mining activity was largely&#13;
labor-intensive, small-scale and primarily carried out by independent&#13;
nationals 1/, the mining industry has been highly capital-intensive and is&#13;
becoming more so, and has infrastructure requirements that are enormous&#13;
compared to most other industries. The order of magnitude of capital&#13;
intensity in mining and processing is gleaned from Table VI, while the&#13;
dualism it leads to is documented in most studies of the mineral economies.2/&#13;
1/ For example, tin in Malaysia, copper in Peru and Chile: see Thoburn&#13;
[1977], Roemer [1970] and Reynolds [1965] respectively. Small-scale&#13;
mining is still of some significance for some minerals and countries:&#13;
see Bosson and Varon [1977], Appendix K, pp. 261-265.&#13;

Although such dualism is characteristic of most developing countries, its&#13;
degree would seem to be higher in the mineral economies. That this is so&#13;
for countries in which processing takes place is easily established by&#13;
reference to a ranking of two-digit industries on the basis of their&#13;
capital-intensity, the top six of which include Petroleum Products,&#13;
Chemicals and Primary Metals (see Table VII).&#13;
A major empirical correlate of technological dualism, evidenced&#13;
by widely differing capital-intensities across sectors, is wage dualism.&#13;
The documentation in support of wage dualism in those mineral economies&#13;
that have been intensively studied is just as overwhelming as that for&#13;
technological dualism. 1/ This not only reflects the higher labor pro-&#13;
ductivity in the more capital-intensive mining sector, but also a variety&#13;
of other factors: first, when nationals replace foreign workers, the&#13;
higher inducement wages paid to the latter must generally be maintained;&#13;
second, the industry's small number of workers makes it easier for them&#13;
to unionize; third, governments tend to support higher wage demands in&#13;
the mining sector as one way of increasing the retained value of mining&#13;
carried out by foreign investors, who in turn often offer higher wages&#13;
than those prevailing in other sectors both to attract higher quality&#13;
labor and because it is deemed to be "good politics". Although wage&#13;
dualism also characterizes non-mineral developing countries, it is likely&#13;
to be more extreme in the mineral economies because of the greater degree&#13;
of technological dualism, the often greater participation of foreign&#13;
investors in the economy and the relative ease with which unionization&#13;
is achieved (due to the small number of workers in the industry).&#13;
A more rigorous test of the hypothesis of greater wage dualism&#13;
in the mineral than in the non-mineral economies would require data on the&#13;
wage structure of various economic sectors for a large number of countries.&#13;
Such data are difficult to come by. However, World Bank data on sectoral&#13;
wages in Zambia, Trinidad and Tobago and Jamaica show extremely high wage&#13;
dualism. Further, in a recent study which compared the coefficient of&#13;
variation of wages (in two-digit sectors) for 18 developed and developing&#13;
countries, Jamaica (the only mineral economy in the sample) ranked fourth. 2/&#13;
Evidence on wage differentials in mineral economies between the&#13;
mining and manufacturing sectors is presented in Table VIII below. It shows&#13;
that not all mineral economies are characterized by very high degrees of wage&#13;
dualism. Thus Algeria, Nigeria and Bolivia had a mining-manufacturing wage-&#13;
ratio of around unity; while Zambia, Venezuela, Chile, Jamaica had ratios&#13;
in excess of 1.6.&#13;

The preceding arguments and the evidence on wage dualism are not&#13;
conclusive; but they seem enough to suggest that there is a tendency for&#13;
greater wage dualism in the mineral economies. In addition, it appears&#13;
that in such wage-gap economies in which workers of like skills receive&#13;
different wages in different sectors, (a) increases in wages tend to spill&#13;
over from the high to the low-wage sectors, thus preserving the wage&#13;
structure but increasing the average wage level; and (b) the rate of&#13;
unemployment, working through the migration mechanism, responds to the&#13;
magnitude of the wage gaps. 1/&#13;
Support for the wage spill-over and higher unemployment rate&#13;
hypotheses for the Jamaican case is argued in a recent study 2/, as well&#13;
as in internal Bank studies for Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and Zambia.&#13;
The severe unemployment problems of mineral economies such as Guyana,&#13;
Indonesia, Bolivia, Liberia, Peru, Algeria, Chile and Zaire have also&#13;
been much emphasized in internal Bank studies 3/ and are supported by&#13;
the unemployment data in Table VIII. Finally, the responsiveness of&#13;
migration to expected wage differentials has received empirical support&#13;
in many developing countries, 4/ and there is no a priori reason to expect&#13;
at least the 'labor surplus' mineral economies to be different. 5/&#13;
1/ The reasoning relies on the assumption that labor supply in various sectors&#13;
responds to expected income differences, and hence migration between sectors&#13;
occurs as long as expected income in the receiving sector is higher than&#13;
that in relevant alternative sectors.&#13;
2/ G. Tidrick [1975].&#13;

4/ See Yap [19771. It is noted that although much of the evidence is based&#13;
on rural-urban migration, and many mining areas are non-urban, the most&#13;
important causal factor has been the expected wage differential.&#13;
5/ Casual empiricism suggest that relative to the non-mineral economies, mineral&#13;
economies have faster-growing 'service' sectors. But the evidence shows this&#13;
to be a mirage: for 1970-75, both groups, on the average, had a growth rate&#13;
of about 6.6 percent in their service sectors. Petroleum economies exhibited&#13;
a rate of 8.2 percent and non-fuel mineral economies, of 4.9 percent. The&#13;
complex nature of intra-sector changes in the service industry during the&#13;
development process is suggested in Keesing [1969].&#13;

The preceding paragraphs have argued first that mineral economies,&#13;
relative to non-mineral economies, are characterized by greater technological&#13;
and wage dualism; second that there is some, although somewhat poor, evidence&#13;
to suggest that the greater wage dualism in mineral economies is associated&#13;
with wage spill-overs from their mining to other sectors; third that there is&#13;
no a priori reason to believe that the responsiveness of migration to expected&#13;
income differentials is any different in mineral economies than in non-mineral&#13;
ones. In a nutshell, it has been argued that mineral economies have large&#13;
wage gaps which continue to be sustained by wage spill-overs and which, in&#13;
turn, given migrant behavior, result in high unemployment rates. As a result,&#13;
mineral economies tend to be high-wage economies characterized by high unemploy-&#13;
ment. (Evidence supporting the high relative wage hvpothesis is presented in&#13;
Table IX). This conflicts not only with their employment and equity objectives,&#13;
but also with the growth objective since the distorted factor prices are likely&#13;
to lead to a misallocation of resources.&#13;
In this discussion of labor markets in mineral economies, it also is&#13;
instructive to examine school-enrollment data for the mineral and non-mineral&#13;
economies for two reasons: first, as an indication of the relative quality&#13;
of labor supply; and second, to compare at least one social indicator for the&#13;
two groups of countries. Table XI below presents the evidence on primary,&#13;
secondary and higher education enrollment for the mineral and non-mineral&#13;
economies. The evidence clearly indicates that over the 15-year period,&#13;
school enrollment has been significantly higher in the non-mineral than in&#13;
the mineral economies, at all levels. In educational development, then,&#13;
mineral economies are far behind the non-mineral economies; furthermore,&#13;
there has been no narrowing of the gap in educational attainment between&#13;
the two groups of countries. The only gratifying bit of evidence in Table XI&#13;
is that the mineral economies have increased school enrollment at about the&#13;
same rate as the non-mineral economies. Given the greater priority of the&#13;
transformation objective in mineral countries, this can hardly be described&#13;
as adequate.&#13;
From a policy point of view, it is important to note that the&#13;
anomalies of the labor market in mineral economies are rooted (a) in the&#13;
wage gap,(b) in institutions which permit wage spill-overs, and (c) in&#13;
institutions which encourage a particular form of migration behavior.&#13;
Thus policies aimed at transforming the high-wage/high-unemployment&#13;
character of mineral exploitation must be aimed at these targets. In&#13;
particular, the following measures would be instrumental in any labor-&#13;
market reform in the mineral economies:&#13;

for higher wages in these sectors;&#13;

the high-wage sectors; in particular, no general&#13;

hiring on a queuing system rather than a random system&#13;
might encourage migrants to register for jobs and wait&#13;
in a lower-wage sector (including agriculture) rather&#13;
than remain unemployed. In general, such institutional&#13;
reforms would have to reflect the behavior of migrants&#13;
and the characteristics of the sharing system (through&#13;
which the unemployed are supported while they wait for&#13;
a job opening) in individual countries.&#13;
II.6 Inflation in the Mineral and Non-Mineral Economies&#13;
Interest in the relative inflation rates in mineral and non-mineral&#13;
economies is of long standing. What does the evidence suggest? Are inflation&#13;
rates higher in the mineral economies? Table XII compares inflation rates for&#13;
the two groups of countries over the 1960-76 period, and shows that while&#13;
inflation rates during the sixties were similar (5.3 percent relative to 5.5&#13;
percent), in more recent years (1970-76) inflation has been higher in the&#13;
mineral economies (16.2 relative to 13.7 percent). Moreover, the evidence&#13;
shows (a) that inflation rates were higher during 1960-70 in the non-fuel&#13;
mineral economies than in the petroleum or the non-mineral economies; and&#13;
(b) in more recent years (1970-76) inflation in the petroleum economies has&#13;
far exceeded that in the non-fuel mineral and non-mineral economies. Are&#13;
there reasons to expect higher inflation rates in the mineral economies?&#13;
Actual inflations are rarely due to any single factor. In what&#13;
ways may it be argued that the mineral economies, relative to the non-mineral&#13;
economies, are more prone to some or all of the following causes of inflation:&#13;
demand-pull, cost-push, internationally transmitted and structural inflation?&#13;
(Since monetary growth must support each of these causes of inflation, it is&#13;
not treated as a primary causal factor.) Only after identifying these&#13;
mechanisms can offsetting policies be suggested.&#13;

Demand-pull inflation often manifests itself in economies cha-&#13;
racterised by export earnings instability-both mineral and non-mineral.&#13;
Since this instability is directly transmitted to fiscal revenues, and&#13;
given the political difficulties associated with cuts in government&#13;
expenditures, governments tend to run fiscal deficits financed largely&#13;
by central bank borrowing. The reduction in foreign exchange earnings&#13;
also implies that imports do not increase aggregate supply. The result&#13;
is a demand-pull inflation. 1/ Although inflations always have a variety&#13;
of causes, this sort of inflation has been characteristic especially of&#13;
the copper exporting countries, Chile, Zambia and Zaire. (See Section II.8).&#13;
A second type of demand-pull inflation is more characteristic of&#13;
the petroleum economies and, in periods of export booms, the other mineral&#13;
economies. In these cases, even though the governmentts budget is in&#13;
surplus, its domestic expenditure out of oil reveneues is in effect&#13;
financed by the issue of high-powered money and is therefore akin to&#13;
deficit financing, except insofar as leakages occur through imports.&#13;
This kind of inflation merges with structural inflation (see below).&#13;
Perhaps the single most important cost-push element in the&#13;
mineral economies is the wage rate in the mining sector, which as noted&#13;
above tends to spill over to other sectors. A second cost-push element&#13;
is the price of food: as we shall note below (Section II.7), agricultural&#13;
production tends to stagnate or grow very slowly in mineral economies,&#13;
resulting in food-price inflation and large food imports. In both of these&#13;
cases, the increased prices easily spread throughout the economy.&#13;
A third kind of inflation in mineral economies, as in other highly&#13;
trade-dependent economies, is that which is transmitted through international&#13;
trade.&#13;
The structuralist view of inflation is deemed to be relevant for&#13;
most developing countries. To the extent that mineral economies are more&#13;
likely to invest massively over relatively short periods with the aim of&#13;
rapidly transforming their economies, they are more likely to hit against&#13;
the supply rigidities or inelasticities that are the main cause of structural&#13;
inflation. There is some truth in the monetarist view that many of these&#13;
inelasticities are inflation-induced to begin with; however, once in operation,&#13;
they are also inflation-causing. Of particular relevance here is the distinction&#13;
1/ Jenkins [1978] points out that, unlike in the Keynesian framework, a fall&#13;
in exports leads to inflation, not unemployment, in mineral economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
between "tradeables" and "non-tradeables", for the supply of "tradeables"&#13;
may easily be increased, albeit not always without problems (especiwally due&#13;
to port congestion and opposition from domestic producers), but "non-tradeables"&#13;
must, of necessity, be supplied domestically. If the growth of productivity&#13;
in these latter sectors is slower than in the "tradeables" sector, (i.e., supply&#13;
is more inelastic in these sectors) and/or demand shifts to these sectors&#13;
(often due to expected inflation), price increases are likely to spread from&#13;
these to other sectors.&#13;
Such structural inflation is often also described as due to absorp-&#13;
tive capacity constraints. It is important to note that there are at least&#13;
two aspects of such constraints; first, there is the view that the marginal&#13;
productivity of new investments begins, at some point, to decline below&#13;
acceptable rates because supplies of co-operant factors are limited; and&#13;
second, it is believed that there are decreasing returns to the scale of&#13;
investment--whose source is not technological but lies rather in the pro-&#13;
cesses of maturation of labor and capital which are inevitably associated&#13;
with new investments. 1/ Both elements can give rise to structural inflation,&#13;
but the former may be inflation-induced while the latter is clearly not.&#13;
If mineral economies are more prone to inflation, as they seem to&#13;
be, and for the sorts of reasons indicated above, we have still to argue&#13;
that the consequences of inflation warrant an attack on it: after all, as&#13;
the structuralists often argue, the costs of fighting inflation may exceed&#13;
the costs of inflation.&#13;
The consequences of inflation are both economic and social.&#13;
Economists have argued that rapid and erratic inflation (often accompanied&#13;
by price controls) causes serious inefficiencies in the allocation of current&#13;
and investible resources. Also commonly cited are the redistributive effect&#13;
of inflation, and the resource costs of levying the inflation tax. In a&#13;
related vein, one may cite at least two socio-economic effects of erratic&#13;
or unanticipated inflation: first, the incentive to be efficient at the&#13;
production and distribution of 'real' goods and services gives way to that&#13;
of forecasting inflation and coping with its consequences, with obvious&#13;
implications for the allocation of people's efforts and ingenuity and for&#13;
the social framework; and second, people tend to rely relatively less on&#13;
private contracts and more on political compacts in trying to ensure for&#13;
themselves a reliable frame for their economic lives, with some danger of&#13;
overloading their political institutions. 2/ These economic and social&#13;
costs of high and unanticipated inflation hardly seem trivial.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
The causes of inflation in mineral economies suggest the kinds of&#13;
policies that may help to keep it at bay;&#13;
(a) Firstly, it is clear that there is no obvious reason why&#13;
export earnings instability must translate into fiscal and import instability;&#13;
the establishment of a reserve fund which is built up during export booms and&#13;
drawn down during export recessions is an obvious solution that has received&#13;
the attention of many mineral economies, such as Zambia, but that in practice&#13;
has been difficult largely it would seem for political reasons. if Poor macro-&#13;
economic management in the face of instability in export earnings is not only&#13;
likely to set off inflation during every export recession, but may also lead&#13;
the mineral economy to accumulate large debts. This is part of the incremental&#13;
savings problem referred to earlier.&#13;
(b) The second cause of demand-pull inflation, arising from the&#13;
effects ot spending high-powered money, calls for some combination of&#13;
expenditure control, offsetting monetary and fiscal policies and&#13;
measures to switch expenditures towards imports. Expenditure control&#13;
is especially relevant for the non-fuel mineral economies whose inflation is&#13;
fuelled by a temporary increase in export earnings,and much less so for the&#13;
petroleum economies whose earnings have taken at least a semi-temporary&#13;
increase. Where fiscal expenditures are considered of greater priority&#13;
than private expenditures, offsetting monetary (reserve-ratios) and fiscal&#13;
(increased taxes) measures may be necessary to maintain internal balance.&#13;
Allowing imports to offset the increased liquidity is an attractive solution,&#13;
but must not jeopardize investments dictated by the long-run comparative&#13;
advantage of the economy. It is most easily achieved by upvaluing the&#13;
exchange rate, but as noted in Section II.9, the evolution of 'the' exchange&#13;
rate in the mineral economy is plagued by the requirement that it must reflect&#13;
one shadow price for the short to medium term (while substantial mineral rents&#13;
flow in) and another for the long-run (when they are withering away).&#13;
(c)   Cost-push inflation in mineral economies, it was argued,&#13;
results from food price inflation and from wage increases in the mineral&#13;
sector which spill over to other sectors. Policy guidelines for the latter&#13;
were discussed above, while those for the agricultural sector are dealt with&#13;
in the next section.&#13;
1/ In an internal Bank study, a simulation model for Zambia suggests that&#13;
Zambia could, over the next decade, comfortably allow government&#13;
expenditures to grow at 3.5 percent p.a., while such a resource fund&#13;
operates alongside.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
(d)   The international transmission of inflation through import&#13;
prices is hardly amenable to policy manipulation except through demand-&#13;
shifts or by encouraging the production of goods that can be domestically&#13;
produced below international prices.&#13;
(e)   Structural inflation is best avoided by appropriately choosing&#13;
the level and sequence of investments in various sectors so as to avoid the&#13;
absorptive capacity constraints that are due to the scarcity of cooperant&#13;
factors and to the gestation lag implied by learning and maturation&#13;
processes. To the extent that some supply rigidities are policy induced they&#13;
call for a general reform of the policy environment. This is, however, more&#13;
appropriately discussed in Section II.9 on foreign-trade regimes in mineral&#13;
economies. A discussion of the appropriate sectoral sequence of investments&#13;
is discussed in SectionIII where the general problem of the sectoral alloca-&#13;
tion of investments for different types of mineral economies is addressed.&#13;
Mineral economies then, are more prone to inflation for a number of&#13;
structural reasons, and the socio-economic costs of inflation are clearly not&#13;
trivial. However, price stability is only one of many objectives that&#13;
governments set themselves, and trade-offs with other objectives do exist&#13;
and will be expected to influence policy. It is sufficient to note here&#13;
that high and unanticipated inflation seems detrimental to growth as well&#13;
as distribution; and although inflation is, in the short run, a 'social&#13;
mollifier', it tends to erode the social order if allowed to persist at&#13;
high erratic rates over long periods.&#13;
The inflationary experiences of two petroleum economies--Iran and&#13;
Nigeria 1/-- in recent years are instructive enough to warrant reference.&#13;
Both countries have, since 1973, exhibited higher than average increases&#13;
in inflation rates. Their record suggests the degree to which (a) increases&#13;
in aggregate demand arising through the monetization of foreign receipts and&#13;
(b) structural rigidities, especially in the non-traded goods sector, can&#13;
combine to spawn high inflation rates and the consequences thereof.&#13;
Throughout the Third and Fourth Plans (1962-72) Iran had remarkable&#13;
price stability, with increases in the wholesale price index(WPI)and consumer&#13;
price index(CPI)peaking (1971/72) at 7.1 and 6.3 percent respectivelv. The situa-&#13;
tion changed dramatically after 1972. In 1973, the WPI increased by 13.1 percent&#13;
and in 1974 by 15.9 percent. Corresponding increases for the CPI were 11.2&#13;
and 15.5 percent, while the 1975 CPI increase, between March and June, was&#13;
17.5 percent.&#13;
1/ The ensuing analysis is based on internal Bank studies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
Two facts are important in suggesting explanations for this&#13;
inflationary trend. Both of them relate ultimately to the large increases&#13;
in expenditure following the 1973 oil-price increase. First, in 1973/74&#13;
the money supply grew by 29 percent, and in 1974/75, by 62 percent. Second,&#13;
the highest price increases were recorded for building materials (27 percent&#13;
in 1974) followed by home produced and consumed goods (17.5 percent) and&#13;
thJrdly, by imported goods (11.9 percent). Both facts suggest that inflation&#13;
in Iran has been due more to the monetization of foreign exchange inflows and&#13;
structural rigidities than to imported inflation. In the meanwhile, budget-&#13;
ted public spending for 1976 was already outstripping oil revenues, while tax&#13;
revenues continued to stagnate. Two other observations are noteworthy: since&#13;
most "non-tradeables" are publicly supplied, excess demand is more likely to&#13;
be expressed in greater congestion, delays etc., than in price increases; and&#13;
the CPI would probably have been higher but for low producer prices paid to&#13;
the agricultural sector.&#13;
The Nigerian experience parallels that of Iran, except that it has&#13;
been even more traumatic. Between 1970 and 1976, Federal capital expenditures&#13;
(in current prices) increased by a factor of forty, while the corresponding&#13;
factor for State capital expenditures was sixteen. Probably, no other country&#13;
has witnessed a more discontinuous expansion of public sector expenditure in&#13;
such a short period. The money supply grew in 1974 by 50 percent, in 1975 by&#13;
70 percent and in 1976 by 40 percent, while the rate of inflation in 1974/75&#13;
was 34 percent. Through various short-term palliative measures--a massive&#13;
import program and consumer subsidies--the rate of inflation was reduced to&#13;
22 percent in 1976. But the Government can hardly continue to pay these&#13;
subsidies indefinitely, nor can Nigeria afford to rely on imports for more&#13;
than a small share of its aggregate supply. There is already evidence that&#13;
the inflation has adversely affected the share of rural in total incomes,&#13;
and it is fairly certain that (in conjunction with the stable exchange rate)&#13;
the inflation has only deepened the import bias of the Nigerian economy.&#13;
The only solution would seem to be to reduce government spending while&#13;
correcting the import bias either through exchange or fiscal means.&#13;
II.6 Agricultural Production and Food Imports in the Mineral&#13;
and Non-mineral Economies&#13;
That mineral economies tend to exhibit low growth in agricultural&#13;
production is evident from a cursory examination of Table XIII below.&#13;
Agricultural growth rates are higher in the non-mineral than in the&#13;
mineral economies (3.6 vs. 3.3 percent for 1960-76, and 3.4 vs. 2.7&#13;
percent in 1970-76), and higher in the petroleum than in the non-fuel&#13;
mineral economies (3.6 percent for 1960-76 and 3.1 vs. 2.6 percent in&#13;
1970-76). The agricultural sector is singled out for mention as a problem&#13;

Although the long-run comparative advantage of some mineral&#13;
economieB is unlikely to be in agriculture, e.g., Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and&#13;
Libya, it is clear that, in general, agriculture plays a critical role&#13;
in the development process, and there is no a priori reason why the&#13;
presence of a vigorous mining sector should encourage mineral economies&#13;
to neglect their agricultural sectors. 2/&#13;
The industry vs. agriculture debate, beleaguered in part by a&#13;
confusion between sectoral growth rates and priorities in government&#13;
economic policy, may have been resolved by recent attempts to clarify&#13;
the areas of complementarity and competitiveness between agricultural&#13;
and industrial development. In the long run,it is the interaction&#13;
between agriculture and other sectors, involving increases in the&#13;
productivity and output of each, that permits rapid growth in the&#13;
national product and in opportunities for productive employment through-&#13;
out the economy. 3/ Thus the case for not neglecting agriculture rests&#13;
(a) on its role in supplying surpluses of food, and sometimes labor and&#13;
capital,to the industrial sector; (b) on its favorable economic charac-&#13;
teristics in terms of the productivity of investment, the provision of&#13;
employment and the distribution of income; and (c) on its complementarity&#13;
with other sectors at the level of final and intermediate demand. This&#13;
implies the need for an acceptance of some measure of 'balanced growth',&#13;
qualified of course, by the possibilities of trade. The objective of&#13;
food self-sufficiency, embraced by many countries and sometimes counter&#13;
to comparative advantage considerations, only adds to the case for en-&#13;
couraging agriculture.&#13;
Of course in any individual economy, the arguments in favor of&#13;
agriculture must be assessed de novo. It is important to note that poor&#13;
agricultural performance in the mineral economies is not explained by low&#13;
agricultural potential. Population density per square km. of agricultural&#13;
land (as a crude measure of agricultural potential) varies considerably&#13;
among the mineral economies. In particular, eighteen of these economies&#13;
have a population density of under 100 per square km: Angola, Bolivia,&#13;
Chile, Guinea, Guyana, Mauritania, Morocco, Peru, Sierra Leone, Syria,&#13;
Togo, Zaire, Zambia, Congo P.R., Gabon, Libya, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela&#13;
(see Section III). 4/&#13;
1/ As for example in internal Bank studies on Algeria, Bolivia, Chile,&#13;
Congo P.R., Ecuador, Iraq, Jamaica, Nigeria, Zaire, Zambia.&#13;
2/ An interesting result, due to P. Temin, is that the historical basis&#13;
for the argument that a declining share of agriculture in GDP is an&#13;
established "pattern of growth" is, at best shaky; the increasing&#13;
share of industry is however clearly established. See Temin [1966-7]&#13;
and Ashworth [1977].&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

If, as emphasized above, agriculture contributes not only to&#13;
growth 1/ but also to employment and a more even income distribution,&#13;
then the case for agriculture is stronger than that implied by considera-&#13;
tions simply of comparative advantage,    In particular, it has been argued&#13;
that diffusion of yield-increasing innovations and technologies within a&#13;
framework of small-scale, labor-intensive farm units will be instrumental&#13;
in determining the extent to which the expansion of farm output will lead&#13;
to widespread increases in income-earning opportunities. Such a 'unimodal'&#13;
strategy, based on the spread of technologies to small-scale farm units,&#13;
may be contrasted with a 'bimodal' strategy that leads to a concentration&#13;
of resources in an atypically large and capital-intensive subsector within&#13;
agriculture. Examples of mineral economies that have tended to pursue a&#13;
'bimodal' strategy are Iran, Liberia, Zambia, Zaire, Bolivia, and Jamaica.&#13;
The major short-run consequence of the poor agricultural perfor-&#13;
mance of the mineral economies has been that a large share of their imports&#13;
are food imports: Table XIV shows that in 1967, the share of food imports&#13;
in total imports was higher in the non-mineral than in the mineral economies,&#13;
but that the position has since changed: over the 1970-75 period it was 17.9&#13;
percent in the mineral economies and 14.6 percent in the non-mineral economies.&#13;
Further, the relevant share is higher in both the petroleum economies (15.4&#13;
percent) and the non-fuel mineral economies (19.4 percent, 1970-74) than in&#13;
the non-mineral economies.&#13;
The primary causes underlying agricultural stagnation in the mineral&#13;
economies are not unlike those in other developing countries, although they&#13;
are perhaps more accentuated. In the first place, commercial and trade&#13;
policies aimed at industrialization, namely the protection of import-&#13;
substituting industry, act as disincentives to both agriculture and exports.&#13;
This is dealt with at some length in Section II.9. A second factor of some&#13;
importance is that of labor shortages in agriculture, resulting from migration&#13;
to cities, which in turn seems to be particularly serious in wage-gap mineral&#13;
economies. Labor shortages in agriculture are important in Jamaica, Trinidad&#13;
and Tobago, Guyana and the Congo People's Republic. Thirdly, in many mineral&#13;
economies such as Chile, Congo P.R., Ecuador, Iran and Nigeria low producer&#13;
prices for food products seem to have discouraged agricultural production.&#13;
And finally, internal Bank studies of most mineral economies suggest that&#13;
agricultural infrastructure, extension credit and research and development&#13;
tend to receive little attention in practice even though an awareness of&#13;
their importance is generally in existence. 2/&#13;
1/ That the marginal productivity of capital is higher in agriculture than&#13;
in industry has been argued most forcefully by M. Lipton (1977).&#13;
2/ This is so, for example, for Bolivia, Congo P.R., Ecuador, Jamaica,&#13;
Liberia, Nigeria, Zaire and Zambia.&#13;

The policy recommendations arising from the preceding discussion of&#13;
the causes of agricultural stagnation in mineral economies are much easier&#13;
stated than implemented:&#13;
(a) A modification of commercial policies to remove the bias&#13;
against agriculture (or more generally ethe urban biast) is clearly a&#13;
priority. This is treated at greater length in Section II.9.&#13;
(b) Reference has already been made to the role of wage policies&#13;
in improving the international competitiveness of the mineral economy's&#13;
non-mineral activities, and in possibly reducing migration and unemployment&#13;
in the cities and hence increasing the supply of labor to agriculture.&#13;
(c) Agricultural pricing policies must reflect the importance&#13;
that agriculture deserves in the long-run development strategy of each&#13;
individual mineral economy. Unfavorable terms of trade for agriculture&#13;
have been advocated on the grounds that they provide a mechanism for&#13;
transferring capital to industry; but this has certainly not been the&#13;
case in mineral economies, which have relied on mining rents for much&#13;
of their 'primitive accumulation'.&#13;
(d) Finally, arguments for the expansion of agricultural&#13;
extension, credit, infrastructure and research can hardly be over-&#13;
emphasized, while on employment grounds, the choice between a unimodal&#13;
and bimodal strategy clearly favors the former.&#13;
II.8 Export Earnings Instability in Mineral and Non-mineral Economies&#13;
The hypothesis that mineral economies are more subject to export&#13;
earnings instability than non-mineral economies is tested here. Table XV&#13;
below shows that the evidence is mixed. For both the 1961-72 and 1968-73&#13;
periods, export earnings were more unstable on the average, in the mineral&#13;
than in the non-mineral economies. However, in the latter period, export&#13;
earnings were more unstable in the non-mineral economies than in the non-&#13;
fuel economies.&#13;
Export earnings instability is considered a problem for most&#13;
developing countries, and it is not surprising that the evidence in&#13;
Table XV is mixed. Studying the causes and consequences of export&#13;
earnings instability in the mineral economies is a major undertaking,&#13;
and we may satisfy ourselves with the evidence for LDCs as a group.&#13;
In particular, there is increasing evidence to suggest that both&#13;
commodity concentration and geographical concentration are positively&#13;
correlated with export earnings instability; 1/ and that the negative&#13;
consequences of such instability on the growth rate, on the level of&#13;
1/ Soutar (1977), Massell (1970). Incidentally, Soutar finds that&#13;
export earnings instability is negatively correlated with the share&#13;
of petroleum in total exports.&#13;

inve-stment and on the growth of exports are significant, l/ The most&#13;
extensive study, with the widest country- and period-coverage to date,&#13;
unambiguously supports the hypothesis that unstable export earnings are&#13;
detrimental to growth. 2/ Finally, the inflationary consequences of such&#13;
instability have already been described (Section II.6).&#13;
The evidence in Table XV provides only an extremely simple test&#13;
of the hypothesis under consideration: it neither holds other factors&#13;
such as commodity and geographical concentration constant, nor does it&#13;
test for statistical significance. It is however suggestive of greater&#13;
export earnings instability for mineral than for non-mineral economies.&#13;
Further support is provided (in Section II.9) by the poorer performance&#13;
of the mineral economies in export diversification.    Additional support&#13;
is implicit in three characteristics of mineral supply and demand: (a)&#13;
low short-run price elasticity of supply once available capacity is being&#13;
fully used; (b) low short-run price elasticity of demand; and (c) quantum&#13;
shifts in the demand for minerals over the business cycle. 31&#13;
The hypothesis that such export earnings instability has tended&#13;
to cause higher international debt ratios in the mineral than the non-&#13;
mineral economies is one that may be at least probed here. The evidence in&#13;
Table XVIa   clearly indicates much higher average external debt ratios&#13;
in the mineral than the non-mineral economies. And although this ratio&#13;
has increased by about fifty percent for both groups between 1970 and 1976,&#13;
the changes within the group of mineral economies have been more pronounced,&#13;
for the debt ratio of the petroleum economies remained unchanged, 4/ while&#13;
that of the non-fuel mineral economies almost doubled. 5/ It is clear that&#13;
the greater propensity to accumulate external debts in mineral economies&#13;
cannot be attributed solely to export earnings instability, for saving perfor-&#13;
mance and macro-economic management can offset the latter. It seems however&#13;
that the greater propensity to accumulate debts in the mineral relative to&#13;
non-mineral economies can hardly be disputed.&#13;

of 99.1 and 63.8 percent respectively, does reduce the mineral economies'&#13;
debt ratio considerably, to 28.1 percent. But the exclusion of the lowest-&#13;
income countries in an analysis of the tendency to accumulate debts in&#13;
mineral economies is surely suspect.&#13;

- 51 -&#13;
The policy implications of this vulnerability of the mineral&#13;
economies, (and in the post-1973 era this applies particularly to the&#13;
non-fuel mineral economies), are three-fold:&#13;
(a) First, it increases the case for the establishment of a&#13;
reserve fund which is accumulated in periods of high export prices and&#13;
depleted during recessions, and more generally, for better short-run&#13;
macro-economic management in the mineral economies (see Section II.6):&#13;
(b) Second, it suggests that mineral price stabilization&#13;
through buffer-stocks and/or production quotas may be worth further&#13;
investigation;&#13;
(c) And thirdly, it lends greater weight to the argument&#13;
for export diversification in the mineral economies (see Section II.9),&#13;
since the effect of commodity concentration on export earnings instability&#13;
seems now to be established.&#13;
The administrative and political difficulties entailed in the&#13;
kind of fine-tuning implied by (a) are not trivial. 1/ Hence it is critical&#13;
that price stabilization and export diversification be regarded as powerful&#13;
alternative weapons in the arsenal of the mineral economies if the costs of&#13;
export earnings instability are to be avoided.&#13;
II.9 The Foreign Trade Regime and Export Diversification&#13;
in the Mineral Economies&#13;
Export diversification emerges on all counts as a worthy deity.&#13;
Firstly, as is clear from the diversification principle in portfolio theory,&#13;
export diversification is an instrument for stabilizing export earnings. 2/&#13;
In addition, the argument for export diversification follows (a) from the&#13;
long-run depletability of mineral reserves and (b) from the possibility of&#13;
declining terms of trade for minerals in a world of uncertain reserves and&#13;
technology.&#13;
The principal argument of this sub-section is that relative to&#13;
the non-mineral economies, the mineral economies' export diversification&#13;
performance has been poor. For the reasons given above, the case for&#13;
export diversification appears to be stronger for the mineral economies.&#13;
As Table XVTb shows, the evidence is not encouraging. Between 1960 and 1976,&#13;
1/ Taylor [1974].&#13;
2/ The portfolio approach to export instability is tested and confirmed in&#13;
Hirsch and Lev [197]], and is indirectly supported by studies which&#13;
confirm the contribution of commodity concentration to export earnings&#13;
instability (see Section I1.8).&#13;

the dependence of the mineral economies on exports of minerals increased&#13;
increased from 59 to 94 percent. This increased dependence was evident&#13;
for both the petroleum (57 to 95 percent) and the non-fuel mineral economies&#13;
(67 to 72 percent). The evidence for the dependence of the mineral economies&#13;
on primary commodities, also compares unfavorably with the non-mineral&#13;
economies: the latter group decreased its dependence on primary commodities&#13;
while the former group's dependence increased.&#13;
The data in Table XVTh therefore support the hypothesis that&#13;
export diversification performance (away from primary commodities) has&#13;
been poorer among the mineral economies than among the non-mineral&#13;
economies.&#13;
The dismal export diversification performance of the mineral&#13;
economies is primarily attributable to their foreign trade regimes.&#13;
Like many other developing countries, many mineral economies have&#13;
established foreign-trade regimes that protect import-substituting&#13;
industries, whether or not this was their original objective, and that&#13;
gave rise to capital-intensive and inefficient (relative to international&#13;
standards) industries. Such foreign trade regimes by definition discrimi-&#13;
nated against exports and agriculture. However, unlike many other develop-&#13;
ing countries, the mineral economies are more able to afford the short- to&#13;
medium-term costs associated with such a policy because their mineral rents&#13;
are not affected thereby. Thus, over this period, food imports increase and&#13;
the need for alternative sources of export earnings may go unperceived.&#13;
In particular, many mineral economies are able to maintain an exchange rate&#13;
that may be appropriate to the high productivity mining sector, but which&#13;
in the light of wage spill-overs to other sectors, etc., is increasingly&#13;
over valued with respect to the non-mineral sector. As long as this policy&#13;
framework operates, export diversification through exports of agricultural&#13;
products or manufactured products is unlikely to occur, and pre-mineral&#13;
agricultural exports are likely to dwindle. This scenario fits the case&#13;
of Chile, in which the mineral sector has been active over the last century,&#13;
almost perfectly; it is largely true also of Jamaica, Guyana, Trinidad and&#13;
Tobago, Nigeria, Zaire, Zambia and Iran, inter alia. 1/&#13;
There is much evidence to support the importance attached to the&#13;
foreign trade regime in the preceding paragraphs. The effects of exchange&#13;
controls, quantitative restrictions and high tariffs on growth and on exports&#13;

have been studied extensively, 21   Three mAjor conclusions emerge,  First,&#13;
among the e-onomies studied, the relatively open ones grew fzster than the&#13;
chronically "closed", The main reasons given for superior performance were&#13;
thiat exports proved to be highly responsive to the reduction or elimination&#13;
of the bias against them, while the partly consequential increase in imports&#13;
reduced the chaotic pattern of import substitution incentives. Secondly,&#13;
and somewhat interestingly, countries that have had export-oriented develop-&#13;
ment strategies have intervened almost as much on the side of promoting&#13;
exports as other countries have on the side of import-substitution. A&#13;
major explanation is thought to be that export products, however much&#13;
they may be sheltered in the domestic market, must face price and quality&#13;
competition in world markets. Of course none of the above detracts from&#13;
the infant industry argument for protection based on internal and external&#13;
economies, although it ought to be noted that protection through subsidies&#13;
is to be preferred to protection through tariffs and/or quotas both because&#13;
of its greater political visibility and on consumer surplus grounds. The&#13;
third conclusion of these studies is the critical importance of stable&#13;
policies: export incentives must not be erratic, or nothing happens.&#13;
Export diversification is, of course, one aspect of the transition&#13;
objective that mineral economies set themselves and must necessarily follow&#13;
an initial effort of diversifying production in the mineral economy.    The&#13;
general problem of the sectoral allocation of investment in different kinds&#13;
of mineral economies is dealt with in Section III. What must be emphasized&#13;
here is that unless the choice of productive activities in mineral (or any&#13;
other) economies reflects their particular long-run comparative advantages,&#13;
and unless trade policies compel a rapid maturation of infant industries,&#13;
the diversified production base is unlikely ever to lead to a diversification&#13;
of exports.&#13;
The preceding discussion has three policy implications for the&#13;
mineral economies, relating respectively to the choice of economic activities,&#13;
protection and the exchange rate.&#13;
(a) The choice of economic activities, and in particular of indus-&#13;
tries to be established, must reflect the country's long-term comparative&#13;
advantage, or else production diversification will not result in export&#13;

diyersification; this is not to deny, of course, that nQn-econQmic objectives&#13;
may ampetimes dictate otherwise.   Section III Addresses the long-r7un c     4mpaative&#13;
advantage issue in detail,&#13;
(b) Protection must only be offered to infant industries, for&#13;
the shortest feasible and pre-fixed interval, and via subsidies rather than&#13;
via tariffs or quotas.&#13;
(c) The exchange rate system is perhaps the most difficult single&#13;
decision for the mineral economy: this is because the mineral economy"s cir-&#13;
cum tances imply, in effect, a low shadow price for foreign exchange in the&#13;
short to medium run and another higher one in the long run when mineral&#13;
reserves are depleted.&#13;
There are essentially two approaches that the mineral economy may&#13;
take, but neither approach reduces to a freely floating exchange rate&#13;
(without subsidies). A freely floating exchange-rate would essentially&#13;
mirror the mineral-rent cycle, the domestic currency's value rising in the&#13;
initial stages, and falling as mineral rents decline. This will simply not&#13;
do, because the market is hardly efficient over time and under uncertainty,&#13;
and there is no escaping the fact that if production and exports are to be&#13;
diversified as the mineral rents decline, gestation lags require that speci-&#13;
fic incentives be offered in the new activities well in advance of such&#13;
declines in mineral rents.&#13;
The first approach would be to decide by political judgement an&#13;
arbitrary "long-term equilibrium" exchange rate and let private considerations&#13;
of profitability determine the mix of activities to be undertaken at this&#13;
exchange rate.  This has the advantage of administrative ease, but amounts&#13;
to a tax on the rest of the private sector in order to protect certain existing&#13;
or planned production units. Thus, it may be advisable for the low-capital&#13;
mineral economies but not for the moderate- and high-capital mineral econo-&#13;
mies who are more likely to want to have this tax levied on the government.&#13;
A variant of this approach, and one that is in principle somewhat more&#13;
attractive, is for the exchange rate to be periodically depreciated but by&#13;
more than is warranted by declines in mineral rents,and by enough to render&#13;
an increasing number of socially beneficial activities privately profitable.&#13;
This arbitrary "medium-term equilibrium" exchange rate approach would be&#13;
more flexible, and would imply a lower tax burden on the consumer, but is&#13;
quite clearly more difficult to administer.&#13;
The alternative approach would be to operate some system of dual&#13;
exchange rates, either de facto or de jure. 1/ Under the de Jure dual&#13;
exchange rate system, one rate would be applicable to the mineral sector&#13;
1/ Bery [1976].&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
and another to the non-mineral-sectoX, Under the de fActq 8ystem, there&#13;
would be a single exchange rate-but lnterlj subsidies would be qffered to&#13;
activities in which the countryts long-term comparative advantage is believed&#13;
to lie. The subsidies would be warranted not only by internal and external&#13;
economies Cinfant industry subsidiest) j    but also by the generally higher&#13;
wages in mineral economies ('wage subsidiest). '/ In both cases, the objective&#13;
would be, once more, to render socially beneficial activities in the non-&#13;
mineral sector privately profitable i.e., to offset various exchange rate,&#13;
labor and capital market imperfections and failures, in order to ensure that&#13;
the long-run comparative advantages of the mineral economy are exploited.&#13;
These are the considerations that ought to underlie the mineral&#13;
economy's exchange rate system. The advantages would seem to lie most with&#13;
the de facto dual exchange rate system because it is most susceptible to&#13;
fine-tuning; but this is precisely what makes it administratively and&#13;
politically less attractive. At the other extreme is the "long-term&#13;
equilibrium" exchange-rate approach which is the least flexible, and&#13;
correspondingly administratively and politically attractive. The "medium-&#13;
term equilibrium" exchange-rate approach and the de iure dual exchange-&#13;
rate system are middle cases, providing greater administrative economy&#13;
and less room for purely political decision-making, but at the expense&#13;
of flexibility. In these assessments, flexibility has been given pride&#13;
of place because the choice of activities in which long-term comparative&#13;
advantages reside is a difficult process, as is the choice of an exchange&#13;
rate. 2/ The "right" answer will clearly be country-specific. 3/&#13;
Two observations are in order here: First, mineral economies may&#13;
be able to postpone remedying their foreign trade regimes through new&#13;
mineral finds which set off new mineral rent cycles. This has occurred&#13;
in Oman, Trinidad and Tobago, Chile and Peru at various times. But the&#13;
critical link between the foreign trade regime and production-export&#13;
diversification cannot be severed. There is no denying the fact that&#13;
the exchange rate is a key policy variable for the mineral economy, and&#13;
one which if inappropriately adjusted over time could result in a set of&#13;
inefficient industries, stagnant agriculture, declining export earnings&#13;
as mineral reserves are depleted, and in some cases, unemployment. The&#13;
1/ Hagen [1958], Johnson [1964].&#13;
2/ Long-term comparative advantage considerations are dealt with in Section III.&#13;
The difficulties inherent in choosing an exchange rate are described by&#13;
Hutchison (1977).&#13;
3/ In other words, the relative dependence on exchange rate and fiscal&#13;
instruments will vary from country to country for political, administrative&#13;
and similar reasons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
relative absence of production and consumption linkages in the mining industry&#13;
implies that the government0a role in establishing an appropriate policy&#13;
environment il all the more critical,&#13;
The second observation is a caveat: the payments regime is only one&#13;
factor among many that determine a country's overall growth, and the relation-&#13;
ship between them is anything but simple. It depends upon a host of other&#13;
institutional factors specific to individual countries and cannot be analy ed&#13;
without regard to other aspects of the domestic economy. This is a principal&#13;
conclusion of recent studies of the relationship between foreign trade regimes&#13;
and economic development, and holds notwithstanding the general statements&#13;
made in the preceding paragraphs.&#13;
I1.10 An Assessment&#13;
The preceding sub-sections have attempted to demonstrate that the&#13;
mineral economies may be distinguished from the non-mineral economies on a&#13;
number of counts. In particular, it has been suggested that the mineral&#13;
economies are less susceptible to fiscal and foreign exchange gaps and&#13;
have the important, but limited, advantage of industrializing via mineral&#13;
processing. On the other hand, with varying degrees of support, it has&#13;
been demonstrated that the mineral economies are more likely: to have&#13;
lower marginal saving rates, higher rates of inflation, lower growth in&#13;
agriculture and higher shares of food in total imports; to develop into&#13;
high wage/high unemployment economies; to perform poorly on export-&#13;
diversification; and, to some extent, to be more open to export earnings&#13;
instability.&#13;
In each of these problem areas, likely underlying causes were&#13;
suggested, and policy recommendations offered.   Three observations are in&#13;
order here:&#13;
(a) First, although each problem area has been analyzed separately&#13;
and policy suggestions offered in a piecemeal fashion, it is clear that there&#13;
are interdependencies within each and that for any given mineral economy, an&#13;
integrated policy package which recognises the links within problem areas and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
policy-tools would have to be designed, 1/&#13;
(b) Second, in keeping with the preceding observation? it is clear&#13;
that there are two policy tools whose relevance cuts across all the problem&#13;
areas identified: (i) the mining sector wage rates, and (Li) Ithe' exchange&#13;
rate. In particular, these policy tools were seen to be instrumental in&#13;
influencing the mineral economy's performance in saving, unemployment,&#13;
inflation, agricultural production, export diversification and through&#13;
1/ For example, just such an attempt is made in an internal Bank study which&#13;
uses a simulation dual economy model for Zambia. The model permits a&#13;
comparison of major economic performance indices under varying assumptions&#13;
with respect to the growth of government expenditures, the level of food&#13;
subsidies, government expenditure on agriculture, and the growth of wages.&#13;
The most important exogenous variable is of course the international&#13;
copper price. In particular, two policy packages are compared. The&#13;
basic scenario assumes that government expenditure grows at 3.5 percent&#13;
p.a., that food subsidies continue, that government expenditures on&#13;
agriculture remain at 20 percent of total government expenditure and&#13;
that real wages rise at the same rate as productivity. The model then&#13;
predicts a growth rate of 4.4 percent p.a., a rapid growth of food imports&#13;
(7.9 percent p.a.), increasing government subsidies, a worsening of the&#13;
income distribution with agricultural incomes falling while urban and&#13;
mining wages increase, and high rates of migration and urban unemployment.&#13;
In contrast, when it is assumed that subsidies are gradually eliminated&#13;
(over 1977-81) and that the share of agricultural expenditure gradually&#13;
increases to 30 percent of total government expenditure, the alternative&#13;
scenario preducts a higher growth rate of 5 percent p.a., a fall in agri-&#13;
cultural imports and rising agricultural production such that Zambia&#13;
becomes a net agricultural exporter after 1990, a slower increase in&#13;
the rural-urban wage gap as real incomes in agriculture increase, though&#13;
not by enough to narrow the gap, and lower migration and urban unemploy-&#13;
ment. The construction of such models for stylized types of mineral&#13;
economies (say, the five types distinguished in Section III) as a means&#13;
of evaluating alternative policy packages, is the most important next&#13;
step in any further work aimed at policy recommendations for the mineral&#13;
economies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
the latter, export earnings stability, 1/ This is nQt to belittle the other&#13;
policy recommendations offered, but to recognise that the influence of these&#13;
two 'prices' is pervasive throughout the mineral economy, Inattention to&#13;
these major 'prices' can only be perilous to the economic performance of&#13;
the mineral economy, and hence to its objectives of growth and transformation&#13;
on the one hand, and employment and better income distribution on the other. 2/&#13;
(c) Finally, in order to contrast them with the non-mineral economies,&#13;
the degree of variation in economic performance within the group of mineral&#13;
economies has not received much attention: in particular, only the distinc-&#13;
tion between petroleum and non-fuel mineral economies was emphasized. But&#13;
the mineral economies' performances with respect to savings, inflation,&#13;
1/ The Zambia model also permits an assessment of a wages policy in the&#13;
Zambian context. In particular, the model suggests that a 1 percent&#13;
reduction in urban real wages would lead to a 1.9 percent increase in&#13;
employment, one-third of this latter change occurring within two years,&#13;
and a 1 percent increase in employment resulting within five years.&#13;
The merit of a wages policy has long been recognised in mineral&#13;
economies such as Zambia, Trinidad and Tobago, Jamaica and Bolivia.&#13;
In particular, it has been tried in the latter three countries, but&#13;
in each case abandoned following a labor crisis e.g., Jamaica in 1972/73&#13;
and Bolivia in 1975. In each of the latter cases, an effort to re-&#13;
instate a wages policy followed closely. The political obstacles in&#13;
the way of a successful adoption of such a policy are clearly no less&#13;
severe in developing, relative to developed,countries.&#13;
2/ In contrast with the general awareness of the high wage problem by the&#13;
mineral economies, the exchange rate problem has received less open&#13;
recognition. Of course varying tariff and subsidy levels imply, even&#13;
with a single and over-valued exchange rate, different effective&#13;
exchange rates for different activities. But an explicit dual&#13;
exchange rate system is much less common in the mineral economies&#13;
than would have been expected. Chile had in the fifties used such&#13;
a system, but no evaluation of its operation and of the reasons&#13;
for its abol       seems to have been done.   (See Reynolds [1957]).&#13;
More recently in January 1974 Iran moved towards a type of dual&#13;
exchange rate system, "aimed at encouraging non-oil exports and&#13;
increasing imports to relieve inflation" but once again, no rigorous&#13;
assessment of its operation seems available. A second area of&#13;
concern in any further work on policies for the mineral economies must&#13;
clearly be to evaluate previous attempts with the dual exchange-rate&#13;
system in mineral economies, and more generally, of other policies as&#13;
well. No matter how confident one is of one's a priori reasoning,&#13;
one can hardly offer policy recommendations without worrying about&#13;
the evaluation of previous attempts with them, even if only in&#13;
distant lands.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
agricultural production and export-diversification do show significant&#13;
variation acroa8 countries. In particular, the variance in these indices&#13;
of medium-term economic performance may be analysed in order to offer&#13;
judgements regarding the long-term prospects of the mineral economies.&#13;
This analysis, as well as that relating to the differences in investment&#13;
priorities across mineral economies, is taken up in Section III.&#13;

111. THE MINERAL ECONOMIES: THE LONG VIEW&#13;
II1.1 Introduction&#13;
In a historical sense, the mineral economies are a rare species.&#13;
Their potential membership in the club of successful export-led developers&#13;
is therefore difficult to conjecture on. However, there are substantial dif-&#13;
ferences among the mineral economies which have a bearing on their relative&#13;
prospects for successful long-term development. In particular, Section 1.3&#13;
drew attention to the importance, for the long-term development of mineral&#13;
economies, of two factors that differ across mineral economies. These were:&#13;
first, the magnitude of the fiscal linkage and the ability of the state produc-&#13;
tively to invest the fiscal proceeds thereof; and second, the choice of an&#13;
appropriate policy environment for economic decision 'Making in the short to&#13;
medium term. This section aims to assess the long-term prospects of the mineral&#13;
economies, differentiating them on the basis of these two sets of criteria. The&#13;
approach is a broad-brush one, and is primarily of heuristic value. But it is&#13;
rooted in the past and present performances of the mineral economies, and pro-&#13;
vides-a basis for offering judgements on the long-term prospects of the mineral&#13;
economies.&#13;
The key to the long-term development of the mineral economies,&#13;
by definition, resides in their mineral exports and in the impact of these&#13;
exports on the rest of their economies. In particular, choices regarding the&#13;
sectoral allocation of investment are a critical problem area when a long view&#13;
of the mineral economies is taken. One of the tasks of this section is to dif-&#13;
ferentiate the mineral economies by reference to divergences between their&#13;
actual sectoral investment priorities and the 'ideal' priorities suggested by&#13;
their growth and equity objectives, given the respective sizes of their mineral&#13;
resources and other comparative advantages. Thus Section I11.2 suggests a&#13;
classification scheme for the mineral economies, Section III.3 suggests&#13;
'ideal' investment priorities in five types of mineral economies, while&#13;
Section II1.4 attempts to identify country- and sector-wise patterns of diver-&#13;
gence between actual and 'ideal' investment priorities in the mineral economies.&#13;
The second task of Section II1.4 is to examine the performance of&#13;
different mineral economies along the dimensions examined in Section II, namely&#13;
with respect to saving, inflation, agricultural production and export diversi-&#13;
fication. Thus Section II.5 examines country-wise patterns in the medium-term&#13;
performance of the mineral economies.&#13;
The preceding identification of country patterns forms the basis&#13;
for an assessment of the long-term prospects for the mineral economies, which&#13;
is offered in Section III.6.&#13;
The major conclusion of Section III is that contrary to one widely&#13;
held view the long-term prospects of the mineral economies are moderately&#13;
favorable: differences in their investment choices and in their medium-term&#13;
performances suggest that some mineral economies have highly favorable long-&#13;
term prospects, and that these prospects are more favorable than those of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
others even after allowing for the size of their respective mineral reserves.&#13;
However, their long-term prospects are seen to be conditional upon critical&#13;
policy choices that are summarized in Section V.&#13;
I11.2 A Classification Scheme for the Mineral Economies&#13;
The key concept in this classificatory attempt is that of long-term&#13;
comparative advantage. It is commonplace that in a dynamic and growing world,&#13;
technological change and changes in factor proportions imply that comparative&#13;
advantage is, in the long run, highly amenable to modification through invest-&#13;
ment choices. Thus the division of total investment over physical capital,&#13;
human capital and R &amp; D (research and development) is instrumental in determining&#13;
the country's long-term comparative advantage. However, the concept of compara-&#13;
tive advantage maintains its usefulness because it requires that resource avail-&#13;
abilities and hence opportunity costs at the beginning of the planning period&#13;
play a critical role.&#13;
The Primary Classification&#13;
The central classificatory device used to differentiate the mineral&#13;
eco;iomies is an index of their lonR-run capital stock per capita. The reason&#13;
for this choice is clear: the specific advantage of these economies is their&#13;
possession of mineral reserves that are, in effect, capital assets. The index&#13;
of long-run capital stock per capita is based on three underlying indicators:&#13;
(a) capital stock per capita at present; (b) the size of their mineral&#13;
reserves; (c) the long-run terms of trade for their minerals;l/ the latter&#13;
two indicators permit an approximate valuation of the per capita mineral&#13;
reserves of each mineral economy.2/&#13;
Adding present capital stock per capita to the per capita value of&#13;
mineral reserves gives an index of long-term capital stock per capita. It is&#13;
best considered an index because it involves gross oversimplifications: apart&#13;
from the usual limitations due to uncertain reserves and prices, it assumes no&#13;
differences in savings or in retained value across countries, and assigns&#13;
revenues generated in their mining sectors to capital formation. Notwithstand-&#13;
ing these limitations, it may be considered a measure of the potential for&#13;
capital formation permitted by their mineral reserves, or an index of long&#13;
term capital stock per capita.&#13;
These data are also used to obtain an index of the stage of uimwal&#13;
exploitation that each mineral economy is presently at. By taking the ratio&#13;
of the value of mineral reserves per capita to the value of present capital&#13;
stock per capita, we obtain an index of mineral exploitation stage.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -&#13;
The indexes of long-term capital stock per capita and of mineral&#13;
exploitation stage allow a classification of the mineral economies into (a) high,&#13;
moderate and low capital groups; and (b ) early, middle and late stage of mineral-&#13;
exploitation groups. Like all classifications these are also somewhat arbitrary.&#13;
But they do separate the mineral economies along dimensions that are interesting&#13;
from the point of view of their long-term prospects.&#13;

The central merit of the preceding analysis is that it provides a&#13;
comparative perspective on the potential contributions of the mineral sector&#13;
to the long-run development of the mineral economies. Thus it is clear from&#13;
the above tables that countries such as Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya and Guinea&#13;
have better potential long-term prospects than countries such as Algeria, Peru,&#13;
Ecuador, Indonesia and Togo; this is so both because the former countries have&#13;
a higher index of long-term capital stock per capita, and because they are at an&#13;
earlier stage of mineral exploitation. In a very real sense, countries at a&#13;
later stage of mineral exploitation can afford far fewer mistakes than those&#13;
at an earlier stage.&#13;
Secondary Classification&#13;
The primary classification of mineral economies distinguished between&#13;
those with high, moderate and low long-run capital stock per capita. The&#13;
secondary classifications are aimed at further pinning down their comparative&#13;
advantages. This is done by focusing on the two other major factors of pro-&#13;
duction: skilled labor and agricultural land, and on their market size. The&#13;
ultimate aim is of course to derive priorities for the sectoral allocation of&#13;
investment for the different mineral economies, as determined by (a) growth&#13;
(comparative advantage) considerations; and (b) distribution (employment)&#13;
considerations.&#13;
The chosen index of the skill level of the population is the Harbison-&#13;
Myers index, one that has come to be used as an index of human resource develop-&#13;
ment.l/ It permits a classification of the mineral economies into high- and&#13;
low-skill economies.&#13;
As an index of the potential for agriculture, the index chosen was&#13;
population density per square kilometer of agricultural land. This allows us&#13;
broadly to classify the mineral economies into those that have and do not have&#13;
high agricultural potential.2/&#13;
The last criterion is that of market size, measured by population,&#13;
and permits a distinction between large and small mineral economies.3/ The&#13;
significance of population as a determinant of country growth patterns has been&#13;
convincingly established.4/ Following from the degree to which domestic demand&#13;
dominates total demand, its major significance for the mineral economies lies&#13;
1/ See for example, Balassa (1977).&#13;
2/ This is clearly a crude measure because it does not allow for quality&#13;
differences; it is somewhat justifiable as a broad classificatory device.&#13;
3/ The dividing line, following the studies cited below, is taken to be a&#13;
population of 15 million.&#13;

in determining the long-term share of international trade in their GDP. In&#13;
particular, together with comparative advantage considerations, it helps&#13;
determine the required long-term level and structure of export diversification&#13;
away from minerals. The structure of export diversification as described below&#13;
derives from the relative weights given to the various types of manufacturing&#13;
(labor intensive, capital intensive and/or resource intensive) on the one hand,&#13;
and agriculture on the other.&#13;
The characteristics of the mineral economies with respect to human&#13;
resource development, agricultural potential and market size are summarized&#13;
in Table XIX below. These comparative advantage considerations, qualified&#13;
by employment objectives, form the basis of the priorities in the sectoral&#13;
allocation of investment for the different mineral economies that are suggested&#13;
in Section III.3.&#13;
III.3 'Ideal' Investment Priorities in the Mineral Economies&#13;
The allocation of investment in the mineral economies may be clas-&#13;
sified along the following lines: physical infrastructure; education and&#13;
training; agricultural extension, credit and research; small-scale enterprise&#13;
development; and by major industrial sectors.l/ The following general statements&#13;
may be made:-&#13;
(a) Investments in physical infrastructure are important in all&#13;
mineral economies, although somewhat more so in the larger than smaller ones,&#13;
and particularly so in land-locked countries;&#13;
(b)   Investments in education and training are more important in&#13;
countries with a large long-term capital stock per capita, and in countries&#13;
where present skill levels are low; for those mineral economies which have a&#13;
potential advantage in capital-intensive industries, research and development&#13;
expenditures will have to follow expenditures on education and training;&#13;
(c)    The importance of investments in agricultural extension,&#13;
credit and research is of course likely to increase with the country's agricul-&#13;
tural potential, but also with the size of the country's population, and to&#13;
decrease with the country's long-term capital stock per capita;&#13;
(d) Efforts to develop small-scale enterprises are likely to be&#13;
more important in large countries, and less important in countries with a&#13;
large long-term capital stock per capita;&#13;
(e) The industrial bias in the mineral economies' development, and&#13;
its structure, may be analysed in terms of the four industrialization strategies&#13;
referred to earlier: import substitution, export diversification, resource-&#13;
based industrialization and basic goods production.&#13;
1/ Any finer distinction of sectors is possible only in the context of multi-sector&#13;
programming models.&#13;

Import Substitution as an industrialization strategy is fraught with&#13;
difficulties unless each industry is guided to maturity in the shortest pos-&#13;
sible time, and market-size considerations are not inhibiting. Thus its feasibility&#13;
increases with the size of the mineral economy. Further, import substitution&#13;
is constrained by the country's supply of capital.&#13;
Export diversification into labor-intensive manufactures is most suited&#13;
to small and skill-abundant economies with moderate levels of long-term capital&#13;
stock per capita.&#13;
Mineral Processing is nominally open to all mineral economies, but as&#13;
the foundation of a resource-based industrialization strategy makes most economic&#13;
sense in those countries with high levels of long-term capital per capita. However,&#13;
these industries are generally also skill intensive, and are inadvisable in countries&#13;
that are unlikely to beabundant in skilled labor in the medium run. The importance&#13;
of research and development in these industries cannot be overemphasized.l/ The&#13;
resource-processing industries, unlike say textiles and automobiles, are tech-&#13;
nically unsettled. Countries opting for mineral processing as the cornerstone&#13;
of their industrialization strategy must therefore be able to develop an R &amp; D&#13;
capability, or else will soon be stranded with inefficient plants.2/&#13;
Finally the basic good industrialization strategy, which is a selective&#13;
mix of import-substitution and resource-based industrialization, is most suited to&#13;
large countries that have high long-term capital stocks per capita, although it&#13;
may also be feasible in countries in which these stocks are moderate. The skilled&#13;
labor and research and development required for resource-based industrialization&#13;
are also necessary, in appropriate measure, to this strategy as well. Since it is&#13;
essentially a mix of two other industrialization strategies, it is not considered&#13;
separately any further.&#13;
The above discussion provides the general considerations upon which&#13;
priorities in the sectoral allocation of investments are offered. These&#13;
considerations do not, however, address the critical problem of sequence. The&#13;
appropriate sequencing of investments in these sectors cannot be overemphasized.&#13;
It is critically related, of course, to the spread of the mineral-rent cycle. But&#13;
more importantly, investments in infrastructure, education and training, and&#13;
research and development need to be carefully planned before the establishment of&#13;
industries that require them as inputs.    Inappropriate sequencing is likely to&#13;
lead to inefficient investments and high inflation, and to necessitate a slow-&#13;
down in the rate of investment. This is evident in some of the high capital&#13;
mineral economies such as Saudi Arabia, and in other mineral economies such&#13;
as Iran and Nigeria.&#13;
1/ This is evident from R &amp; D rankings of 2 digit industries.&#13;
2/ The importance of a technology strategy in the industrialization process&#13;
is clear from the Japanese example, and in a negative fashion from recent&#13;
British experience; see,respectively, Blumenthal (1976) and Peck (1968).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
The preceding considerations suggest that, by their 'ideal' development&#13;
paths, the mineral economies may be classified into five groups:l/2/&#13;
(a) Small High-Capital Group&#13;
Since all mineral economies in the high capital group are small, this&#13;
category includes Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Libya, Guinea and Gabon. Except for&#13;
Guinea, which is at present highly underdeveloped and has a high agricultural&#13;
potential, the long-term strategy for these economies is resource-based capital-&#13;
intensive industrialization, with agriculture playing the largely passive role of&#13;
maintaining structural balance or the non-economic role of ensuring food self-&#13;
reliance. This requires careful pre-planning in the fields of education and&#13;
training and in research and development capabilities. Although investments in&#13;
capital-intensive plants may begin early, the emphasis at the earlier stages would&#13;
need to be on the manpower requirements of such industries and on efficient&#13;
import-substitution in industries for which market size is not much of a limitation&#13;
Investments in education have long gestation lags, and hence the critical importanc.&#13;
of the sequence of investments in these economies. Some reliance on foreign&#13;
expertise is to be expected in the early stages. But if these economies are to&#13;
evolve away from rentier to productive economies, upgrading their domestic skills&#13;
is essential. Industrialization is capable of solving the employment problem in&#13;
these economies if the right investment priorities and sequence are emphasized.&#13;
The case of Guinea differs because its mineral reserves remain largely untapped;&#13;
although its long-term strategy should not differ from the others in this group,&#13;
the pace of approach seems likely to be much slower and a far greater reliance on&#13;
agricultural investments is warranted for the forseeable future.&#13;
1/ The characteristics of these groups are described below by emphasizing the&#13;
differences between them rather than repeating the common features each time.&#13;
2/ This classification of development strategies may be compared to that in Chenery&#13;
and Syrquin [1975]. The latter study uses three major criteria for classificati&#13;
namely market size, trade orientation and primary-industrial specialization; as&#13;
such it distinguishes between four development patterns: primary specializatior&#13;
balanced production and trade, import substitution and industrial specializatior&#13;
Our own classification wsesmarket size; in addition, since mineral exporters are&#13;
by definition highly trade-oriented, it emphasizes instead the degree to which&#13;
mineral wealth can bolster the accumulation processes in the mineral economies,&#13;
the implications of the size of this wealth (relative to population) for the del&#13;
lopment strategy of individual mineral economies. Thus, most mineral economies&#13;
are still in a primary specialization stage, and their market size, present deg,&#13;
of development, agricultural potential, and mineral wealth per capita suggest&#13;
what the relative emphases on various industrial sectors, on agriculture, and o0&#13;
the associated investments in education and training and R&amp;D expenditures might&#13;
be. These indicators suggest,then, for individual mineral economies, whether&#13;
the movement away from primary specialization ought to emphasize balanced pro-&#13;
duction and trade, import substitution or industrial specialization. As argued&#13;
earlier, the mineral economies, although specializing in the primary sector,&#13;
differ vastly from the agricultural primary specialized countries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
(b)   Large Moderate-Capital Group&#13;
For the two large mineral economies, Iran and Morocco, option (a) is&#13;
not available, due to their lower ratios of mineral reserves to population. In-&#13;
dustrialization by itself cannot solve the entire employment problem, and agriculture&#13;
must therefore play a pivotal role, as must small-scale enterprise development.l/&#13;
Appropriate investments in agricultural infrastructure, extension, research and&#13;
credit are therefore warranted as are similar efforts in the direction of small-&#13;
scale enterprises. The appropriate extent of the former investments will, of&#13;
course, vary with the degree to which the economy has a comparative advantage in&#13;
agriculture. Industrialization can be more broadly based in these economies:&#13;
their size makes import substitution in consumer as well as capital goods&#13;
economically viable, and their capital endowment is high enough to permit selective&#13;
resource-based industries (for which complementary investments in education and&#13;
R &amp; D are required). The general development strategy for these countries is&#13;
best described in the words of the Chinese dictum: "walking on two legs".&#13;
(c)   Small Moderate-Capital Group&#13;
This group has the capital endowment characteristic of the latter&#13;
category, but not their market-size advantage. The essential difference between&#13;
them is that the small moderate-capital group must be more export oriented than&#13;
the large moderate-capital group. This implies an important role tor iabor-&#13;
intensive exports, exports from selective resource-based industries, and agricul-&#13;
tural exports if comparative advantage permits. Since industrialization cannot&#13;
employ the entire labor force, agriculture and small-scale enterprise develop-&#13;
ment are also priority sectors. For these economies, then, walking on two legs&#13;
is not sufficient: export markets must provide further support. Countries&#13;
in this category are Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago, Chile, Zambia, Guyana,&#13;
Iraq and Jamaica.&#13;
(d)   Large Low-Capital Group&#13;
This group and the next share the major disadvantage of having relatively&#13;
small mineral wealth relative to population. This means that, unlike the other&#13;
mineral economies, these two groups simply cannot afford the various short-&#13;
and medium-term mistakes that mineral economies were seen to be prone to. The&#13;
discovery of mineral reserves sets off a dynamic that is likely to come to a&#13;
halt long before these economies have provided productive employment to their&#13;
labor forces. The aim of the large low-capital countries ought to be to emulate&#13;
the development strategy of the large moderate-capital group through a very&#13;
high saving effort. The alternative is, otherwise, not a very promising one.&#13;
Countries in this group are Algeria, Nigeria, Peru, Indonesia and Zaire.&#13;
1/ The historical role of small-scale enterprises in the development process&#13;
is more pervasive than is generally recognized; see Hoselitz (1959).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
(e) Small Low-Capital Group&#13;
This group, as the preceding remarks suggest, must aim at the develop-&#13;
ment strategy of the small moderate-capital group through a high saving effort,&#13;
if it is to make the transition to a diversified economy providing employment&#13;
to its entire labor force. This group includes Bolivia, Ecuador, Togo, Syria,&#13;
Liberia, and the Congo P.R.&#13;
111.4. 'Ideal' and Actual Investment Priorities in the Mineral Economiesll&#13;
The preceding discussion provides a framework for offering 'ideal'&#13;
investment priorities for the various mineral economies. These 'ideal' priori-&#13;
ties may be compared to the actual development paths that individual mineral&#13;
economies seem to be embarked upon. A comparison will then suggest what the&#13;
most frequent divergences seem to be. This is only meant to capture broad&#13;
tendencies rather than to reflect on the appropriateness or otherwise of the&#13;
investment priorities of individual mineral economies. In particular, our&#13;
assessments of the mineral economies' actual performance are based upon the con-&#13;
clusions of internal Bank studies. Since our assessments are expressed qualita-&#13;
tively, they are individually subject to a margin of error, although the general&#13;
characterization of these economies is fairly accurate.&#13;
The comparison between 'ideal' and actual priorities is made along the&#13;
following dimensions: capital-intensive import substitution, labor-intensive&#13;
import substitution, resource-based industrialization, labor-intensive manufactui&#13;
exports, education and training, and agricultural extension, credit and research.&#13;
Comparisons for physical infrastructure and small-scale enterprise development&#13;
are not made, due to inadequate information.&#13;
The divergences between 'ideal' and actual development priorities may&#13;
be analyzed by asking two questions: first, what country patterns, if any,&#13;
emerge as one moves from countries with low to countries with high divergence;&#13;
and second, what sectors seem most often to be under- or over-emphasized? The&#13;
following patterns2/ seem to emerge:&#13;
(a) More mineral economies have high divergences than low divergences;&#13;
(b) countries with high divergences include members of the moderate and&#13;
low capital groups; they also include countries at various stages&#13;
of exploitation of their mineral reserves, are both small and large,&#13;
and are both long-time mineral economies and new ones;&#13;
1/ In this section, investment priorities are suggested purely on the basis&#13;
of macro-economic characteristics of countries. In particular, no assessment&#13;
of the efficiency of past investments is either offered or implied.&#13;
2/ Like all patterns, these can only be measures of central tendency.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
(c)  their low divergences indicate that Saudi Arabia, Morocco and&#13;
Venezuela have favorable investment priorities; but of these,&#13;
only Venezuela (in its late mineral-exploitation stage) already&#13;
has a fairly diversified economy;&#13;
(d)  the next group of economies showing relatively low divergence&#13;
has one striking characteristic: the two members of the&#13;
group are both centrally-planned economies (Algeria and Iraq);&#13;
(e)  the divergence is highest for Zaire; but it is also relatively&#13;
high for two mineral economies of long standing (Chile, Zambia),&#13;
for three of the largest mineral economies (Indonesia, Nigeria and&#13;
Iran); and for two economies that are already in their late&#13;
mineral exploitation stage (Trinidad and Tobago, Congo P.R.);&#13;
(f)  finally, among sectors, more mineral economies have tended to&#13;
underemphasize agriculture and labor-intensive manufactures, and&#13;
to overemphasize resource-based industrialization, while both&#13;
education and training and import substitution have fared better;&#13;
(the efficiency of import substituting investments is not being&#13;
judged here, only its sectoral priority).&#13;
These observations do not provide any firm conclusions. But they are&#13;
at least mildly suggestive of some conjectures or working hypotheses. These&#13;
are stated below, and for ease of expression rather more baldly than the evidence&#13;
warrants:&#13;
(a) Investment priorities tend to be chosen better in the high capital&#13;
group and in the more centrally planned mineral economies. This may be because&#13;
the former group is less disposed to overstretch its capacity constraints (and&#13;
empirically, excludes all of the larger mineral economies); while centrally-&#13;
planned economies are, in general, more successful in achieving planned priorities&#13;
in the sectoral allocation of investments.&#13;
(b) Investment priorities seem to be particularly misplaced in the&#13;
large mineral economies.  This may   have   something to do with their being in&#13;
the low or middle capital group and therefore aiming to speed up the development&#13;
process; or with the sheer size of their populations which make greater demands&#13;
on their managerial and project-related capabilities; or with the non-economic&#13;
objectives which are more often embraced by larger countries.&#13;
(c) The period over which mineral exports have been important for the&#13;
economy is no indication of whether the appropriate sectoral priorities are being&#13;
followed; Chile and Zambia are at one extreme, Venezuela at the other, and Peru&#13;
in between, and yet all of them are mineral economies of long standing.&#13;
(d) The stage of exploitation is not indicative of whether or not a&#13;
mineral economy's investment priorities are likely to be appropriate; in particular,&#13;
Venezuela and Algeria on the one hand, and Trinidad and Tobago and Congo P.R. on&#13;
the other, are all in their late stages but have fairly different degrees of&#13;
divergence.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
(e) The mineral economies as a group seem not to attach sufficient&#13;
priority to agriculture and labor-intensive manufactures, and to overemphasize&#13;
resource-based industrialization, but generally give appropriate weights to&#13;
education and training and import substitution.&#13;
The preceding comparison of 'ideal' and actual investment priorities,&#13;
while useful in capturing tendencies in the mineral economies, is sketchy and&#13;
unanimated. To fill in some detail and to exemplify changes in investment&#13;
priorities undertaken by the petroleum economies after 1973, brief references&#13;
to the experience of selected mineral economies would be useful. The choice of&#13;
countries for such treatment is guided by the divergence between their actual&#13;
and 'ideal' investment priorities. Thus, we treat Algeria, Morocco and Venezuela&#13;
as examples of countries with low divergence, and Congo P.R., Chile, Trinidad and&#13;
Tobago, Nigeria, Zambia, Zaire and Iran as examples of countries with relatively&#13;
high degrees of divergence.l/&#13;
Algeria. In the five-way classification of mineral economies offered&#13;
above, Algeria falls in the large low-capital group. Hence, its 'ideal' invest-&#13;
ment priorities are essentially guided by balance between industry and agricul-&#13;
ture, with the former sector being characterized by import substitution in con-&#13;
sumer and capital goods as well as selective resource-based industries. In addition&#13;
the role of education, training, and R &amp; D expenditure would be expected to be&#13;
important. Since it is in the low-capital group, a high saving effort would be&#13;
particularly necessary.&#13;
In 1966, Algeria's Revolutionary Council defined Algeria's long-term&#13;
development strategy as emphasizing industrialization and the acceleration of&#13;
education and training. Algeria obtained results close to planned&#13;
objectives; the share of investment in GDP rose from 15% to 39% between 1966 and&#13;
1973, while the population in school increased from 1.5 million to 2.9 million&#13;
over the same period. However, less satisfactory results were registered in&#13;
the agricultural sector where slow output growth was accompanied by an increase&#13;
in underemployment; about 9% of the agricultural labor force was officially&#13;
considered to be "strongly underemployed" in 1973 compared to 4% in 1966. Pro-&#13;
viding jobs for unskilled workers therefore continued to be a worrisome problem.&#13;
The improvement in Algeria's financial situation following the 1973&#13;
oil price increase led to an acceleration of the pace of economic development.&#13;
The 1974-77 Plan ained at increasing investments, broadening the productive base,&#13;
shifting the distribution of investment in favor of sectors other than industry,&#13;
and improving the employment prospects of unskilled labor. A post-Plan evaluation&#13;
suggests that these aims were largely accomplished. Substantial employment creatio&#13;
reduced the unemployment rate in non-agricultural sectors to about 10 percent in&#13;
1976 compared to 17 percent in 1973; growth in the non-hydrocarbon sectors was&#13;
higher than in the hydrocarbon sector (10 percent relative to about 1 percent);&#13;
1/ The ensuing country examples, and the data used therein, are based on internal&#13;
Bank studies of the respective countries undertaken in and around the mid-&#13;
seventies. In some cases, investment priorities may have been modified in&#13;
the last year or two. Since the emphasis is on broad historical characteriza-&#13;
tions, the country analysis remains valid even in the latter cases.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
and the saving performance remained impressive at 44 percent of GDP. There were&#13;
also some blemishes, however. Although agricultural output growth was high&#13;
(around 8 percent) over 1974-76, actual public investment in agriculture was&#13;
around 6 percent, only half of planned investment in that sector. Education&#13;
and training also received 6 percent relative to a planned 9 percent of total&#13;
public investment over the 1974-77 period. In contrast, the hydrocarbon sector&#13;
received about 24 percent relative to a planned 18 percent.&#13;
These remarks suggest, as will be confirmed below, that the divergence&#13;
between actual and ideal investment priorities, although not insignificant, is&#13;
lower in Algeria than in other mineral economies.&#13;
Morocco. Morocco falls in the large moderate-capital group; but unlike&#13;
the other member of this group - Iran - the time profile of its mineral rents is&#13;
more spread out. Thus, it must aim at a greater balance between industry and&#13;
agriculture, and make a relatively high saving effort (since its mineral wealth&#13;
is less easily tapped immediately).&#13;
The Second Plan (1968-72) saw growth in all sectors, and an unchanged&#13;
structure of production. Thus agriculture grew slightly faster than GDP at 6&#13;
percent p.a., as did mining, energy and tourism. Manufacturing expanded by about&#13;
5 percent p.a. But unemployment remained at about 9 percent of the labor force,&#13;
with higher rates in the urban centers. Modern agriculture and industry pro-&#13;
vided relatively few new jobs, and underemployment in agriculture and services&#13;
persisted. Although education and training received much emphasis, Morocco is&#13;
still to utilize its educated in labor-intensive industries aimed at the domestic&#13;
as well as export markets. Thus, although it is commendable that agriculture&#13;
receives the highest priority and that phosphate processing receives its due&#13;
attention, greater attention to the scope for labor-intensive agriculture and&#13;
manufacturing is essential if the unemployment and underemployment problems are&#13;
to be redressed. The Third Plan recognized this objective, but performance over&#13;
1973-77 has still to be evaluated.&#13;
Venezuela. Venezuela belongs to the small moderate-capital group. It&#13;
is therefore required to emphasize some degree of industrial specialization and&#13;
to rely on export markets. The importance of diversifying its productive base&#13;
is paramount because Venezuela's petroleum production has been declining and it&#13;
is in the late stage of exploiting its known mineral reserves.&#13;
Venezuela's investment priorities in the past have emphasized balance&#13;
between agriculture and industry. Long-term trends show that Venezuela has been&#13;
able to maintain a fairly high rate of growth of GDP (4.2 percent over 1970-75;&#13;
5.9 percent excluding petroleum) and a higher rate of growth in industry (4.8 percent&#13;
or 7.4 percent excluding petroleum production). Although the share of industry&#13;
is somewhat smaller than that in other Latin American countries, Venezuela has&#13;
in recent years experienced very rapid change in industrial structure: if indus-&#13;
trial diversification is measured by the change in the ratio of value added in&#13;
metal-mechanical industries to value added in traditional industries, Venezuela&#13;
experienced greater diversification than Brazil, Colombia and Peru between 1963&#13;
and the early seventies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
Venezuela's agricultural growth over the past two decades has also&#13;
been impressive: between 1949-51 and 1975, real agricultural output grew at&#13;
5.2 percent p.a. Emphasis on education and training has long been pursued, and&#13;
Venezuela has large numbers of trained and experienced people at all levels,&#13;
from managers and h:i.h level technicians to skilled workers and operators.&#13;
Notwithstanding the preceding remarks, Venezuela has a relative&#13;
scarcity of skilled manpower, especially in the light of its investment program&#13;
following the 1973 oil price increase. In addition, industrial development has&#13;
reached a point where the traditional strategy of import substitution must in-&#13;
creasingly be replaced and complemented by one emphasizing industrial speciali-&#13;
zation and export development. In the former group, emphasis is being given to&#13;
resource-based industries (steel, petrochemicals and aluminum    and industries&#13;
linked to these. It is important that export development not be neglected since&#13;
given its market size, the employment and diversification objectives make exporting&#13;
indispensable.&#13;
Congo P.R. Congo P.R. falls in the small low-capital group; hence it&#13;
must emphasize agriculture and labor-intensive manufactures, be highly export-&#13;
oriented, and achieve high saving rates. These aims are more compelling because&#13;
the Congo P.R. has extremely low mineral reserves per capita; oil production&#13;
increased from 100,000 metric tons to 2 million metric tons in 1973, but had&#13;
already begun to decline by 1975. Output from a second oil field is expected&#13;
to come on stream in 1978; and although the prospects for other oil wells are&#13;
considered quite bright, Congolese oil is known to have high recovery costs.&#13;
Output has declined in the agricultural sector, the mainstay of the&#13;
economy: although agricultural production increased by 4.5 percent in 1971,and&#13;
2.0 percent in 1972, it declined by 1.2 percent in 1973 and appears to have&#13;
stagnated since. This is believed to be due to labor shortages in the rural&#13;
areas, deterioration of roads and low producer prices. Exports of the other&#13;
major export item, timber, have also fallen as the most accessible forests have&#13;
become increasingly bare. Further exploitation of the Congo's vast timber resource&#13;
will have to await improvements in its transportation system.&#13;
Recent saving performance has been on the low side even though the&#13;
investment rate has consistently been above 20 percent and reached 27 percent&#13;
in 1974. External sources supply on the average as much as much as 75 to 50&#13;
percent of total investment -- a proportion that largely reflects investments&#13;
in the mining industries. External public debt has been rising.&#13;
Although the 1975-77 Plan allocates 15 and 38 percent of planned&#13;
expenditures to agriculture and infrastructure respectively, it was based on&#13;
higher oil production estimates than were realized and it is not clear what&#13;
sectors will be de-emphasized as a result.&#13;
Chile. Chile belongs to the small moderate-capital group. This&#13;
implies a significant degree of export-orientation -- labor-intensive and resource&#13;
based manufactures as well as agricultural commodities. In connection with&#13;
these sectors, some emphasis on education and training is also called for.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

Chile 1/is mere highly urbanized than most developing &amp;.conomies,&#13;
and its urban growth was stimulated by the development of services rather tharn&#13;
by that of manufacturing. Given the dominant role of the mining sector, Chile's&#13;
past development has appropriately been described as "primary-terLiary" -in&#13;
nature. Education and training have received much attention but have primarily&#13;
fed the service industries. Given the extremely high degree of urbanization,&#13;
most prior governments have kept food prices relatively low, and agricultulral&#13;
output has tended to be sluggish while food imports have continued to increasad.&#13;
Chile has in the past failed to disengage itself from its almost&#13;
complete dependence upon copper; its agricultural potential is relatively&#13;
unexploited, and its industrial sector is "inward-looking" to an extreme degree.&#13;
With its highly trained labor force, Chile has much potential for export-&#13;
oriented development which remains untapped. Perhaps more than in any other&#13;
mineral economy, past policies have tended to be guided by short-term considerations&#13;
rather than by development objectives.&#13;
Trinidad and Tobago belongs to the small moderate-capital group, and&#13;
like Chile and Venezuela would be required to stress export activities, especial-&#13;
ly in manufactures, since its agricultural potential is low.    Corresponding&#13;
investments in education and training would be necessary.&#13;
During its Third Five-Year Plan (1969-73) GDP grew at 2.3 percent p.a.&#13;
in real terms -- much below the target rate of 4.3 percent. This was to a large&#13;
extent due to the unexpected decline of some 30 percent in oil production as&#13;
known reserves were depleted. Production from newly discovered reserves began&#13;
in 1972 and,together with the increased oil prices since 1973, could provide&#13;
the basis for future growth if appropriately invested. Past development in&#13;
Trinidad and Tobago has manifested many of the negative symptoms of a dual&#13;
economy, with the high productivity of the petroleum sector contrasting sharply&#13;
with that in other sectors of the economy. Despite the recognition in the Third&#13;
Five-Year Plan that industrial development must be geared toward export markets,&#13;
the effect of industrial promotion policies has been to encourage import substitu-&#13;
tion. Agriculture-provides employment for 25 percent of the labor force, and has&#13;
received much government attention, but the tendency has been to concentrate on&#13;
the development of new crops and the cultivation of new land, even though tradi-&#13;
tional export crops would seem to be unwarranted.&#13;
A detailed development strategy which takes account of the higher&#13;
petroleum earnings is under formulation. The general thrust of government&#13;
thinking, unfortunately, is to plough back into the petroleum sector and&#13;
petroleum-based industries a large part of the higher revenues anticipated.&#13;
This is only likely to entrench dualism, and to exacerbate Trinidad and Tobago's&#13;
most serious problem, that of unemployment.&#13;
1/ Since 1973 the Chilean economy has undergone relatively drastic changes.&#13;
The above characterization reflects the pre-1973 growth pattern.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

Nigeria was earlier classified as a large low-capital country. Hence,&#13;
the importance of agriculture as well as industry and,in the latter, of import&#13;
substitution in consumer and capital goods and of selective mineral processing.&#13;
Its low-capital status suggests further that high savings would be necessary if&#13;
its mineral endowment is to be used for developmental purposes.&#13;
The performance of the directly productive sectors in recent years&#13;
has been particularly disappointing. Nigeria's economic development has been&#13;
dominated by the oil sector which in 1974 accounted for 41 percent of GDP,&#13;
93 percent of export earnings and 82 percent of government revenue, surpassing&#13;
the agricultural sector in all measures of relative importance except employment.&#13;
The growth of manufacturing output, although high (10-12 percent p.a.), has been&#13;
hampered by physical bottlenecks and, to some extent, by import competition.&#13;
The decline of agricultural exports following the emergence of the petroleum&#13;
sector has continued unabated.&#13;
The Third National Development Plan (1975-80) was comprehensively&#13;
reviewed in 1976 by the government, both because of rising prices and an over-&#13;
estimation of oil, revenues: although the bulk of thepublic sector program was&#13;
left unchanged, prestige projects were reduced in scope and greater emphasis&#13;
was given to such areas as agriculture, education, housing and health. Most&#13;
importantly, the significance of agriculture and rural development to the&#13;
future growth prospects of the country was recognized.&#13;
The emergence of sizeable budget deficits and declining foreign&#13;
reserves in 1975/76 meant that a sharp reduction in government spending was&#13;
necessary. The financial constraint calls for a careful assessment of the&#13;
appropriate sequence of investments among the following sectors: infrastructure,&#13;
education, industry, agriculture and the social sectors such as housing and&#13;
health. In particular, in the context of the 'ideal' investment priorities dis-&#13;
cussed above, it would seem inappropriate for a low-capital group country such&#13;
as Nigeria to be spending 21.7 percent of the public sector investment program&#13;
on social services, and only 6.7 percent and 16.2 percent respectively on agri-&#13;
culture and manufacturing. It would seem wise to follow the recommendations of&#13;
the Anti-Inflationary Task Force and give higher priority to the directly&#13;
productive sectors.&#13;
Finally, the bias against industry and agriculture and in favor of&#13;
imports must be corrected if these productive activities are to re-emerge as&#13;
foci of growth and employment. This calls, among other things, for adjustments&#13;
in the exchange rate or equivalent fiscal or commercial measures. These problems&#13;
and the appropriate solutions are recognized, and are gradually being acted upon.&#13;
Zambia, classified as belonging to the small moderate-capital group,&#13;
would be expected to be highly export oriented,l/ and to emphasize agriculture,&#13;
1/ Since Zambia is landlocked, transportation costs are likely to impede the&#13;
development of exports; however, there may still be scope for exports to&#13;
neighboring countries, such as Zaire and Angola.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
labor-intensive industry and selective resource-based industry, with the&#13;
associated investments in education and training.&#13;
With its vast mineral resources and high agricultural potential,&#13;
Zambia possesses the potential for rapid sustained growth. To date, however,&#13;
the contribution of these sectors to growth and development has been below&#13;
potential. Zambian development since 1964 has been characterized by declining&#13;
productivity of capital and increasing capital intensity in the modern sector,&#13;
a lagging agricultural sector, and increasing urban unemployment. Although&#13;
manufacturing has grown faster than other modern sector activities, it has con-&#13;
tributed less to import substitution and employment than would have been pos-&#13;
sible with more realistic factor prices and a greater agro-processing orientation&#13;
in industrial investment. An internal Bank study projected that, with proper&#13;
pricing and investment policies for rural development, Zambia could achieve an&#13;
average annual rate of agricultural growth of 6-7 percent over the next two&#13;
decades. Such growth would not only supply Zambia's food and raw material needs,&#13;
but would also probably create net surpluses for export. Increasing attention&#13;
to the agricultural sector in the very recent past is clearly an encouraging sign.&#13;
Zambia has made impressive strides in education and training, but there&#13;
are still acute shortages of manpower in science and commerce-based occupations,&#13;
and in high and middle level agricultural jobs. The 1976 Education System Review&#13;
recommends a major effort in education and training, but one that may be exces-&#13;
sive relative to budgetary resources, and that almost certainly calls for some&#13;
pruning down.&#13;
It is clear that to diversify the productive base and to improve employ-&#13;
ment opportunities, incentives should encourage investment in agriculture by&#13;
commercial and traditional farmers, in the processing of resource-based (largely&#13;
agricultural) products and in more labor-intensive methods of production.&#13;
Zaire, like Nigeria, is also a large low-capital country, with the&#13;
major difference that its mineral-rent cycle is likely to be more spread out&#13;
over time. These characteristics and Zaire's high agricultural potential and&#13;
low level of skills suggest that the major emphasis in the earlier stages of&#13;
of its development ought to be on agriculture, education and training and some&#13;
processing of minerals and other resources, with increasingly complex manu-&#13;
facturing being gradually introduced over time. The importance of a high saving&#13;
effort is, of course, clear.&#13;
Zaire's economy grew at a rate of about 7 percent from 1968 to 1973.&#13;
The rate of saving, which was around 25 percent in the late sixties, has fallen&#13;
to 20 percent while foreign borrowing has increased to keep Lnvestments at the&#13;
earlier level. The highest growth rates occurred in manufacturing, construction&#13;
and services (including government), and to some extent in mining and power&#13;
generating activities. Agriculture grew at 2.5 percent--below the rate of&#13;
population growth. Investment in agriculture has been low -- about 8 percent&#13;
of domestically-financed government investment in recent years, or 2 percent of&#13;
total government capital expenditure (including government investments financed&#13;
directly by external aid agencies). Similarly, expenditure on education and&#13;
training has been extremely low -- 6 percent of domestically-financed or 2 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78 -&#13;
of total government capital expenditure in recent vears. On the other hand,&#13;
investment in import-substituting manufacturing and mining have accounted&#13;
for 90 percent of capital expenditures in the private and semi-public sectors.&#13;
In short, the only priority sectors that have received due attention are&#13;
physical infrastructure and mining, while agriculture, education and training&#13;
and resource-processing continue to be neglected.&#13;
Iran, being in the large moderate-capital group, would be expected to&#13;
emphasize balance between agriculture and industry and,in the latter, between&#13;
import-substituting and resource-based processing; it would also need a com-&#13;
mensurate effort in education and training. Like Nigeria, Iran's response to&#13;
the increased flow of financial resources since 1973 has been to attempt to do&#13;
too much, with the predictable result that much reformulation has been necessary&#13;
in recent years and as inflation has reached very high levels.&#13;
Over the 1962-72 decade, Iran achieved an average annual growth rate&#13;
of 11 percent in real GNP. The boom in oil revenues, which increased between&#13;
1962 and 1972 from U.S.$400 million to U.S.$2.4 billion annually,helped to&#13;
finance massive investments in economic infrastructure and a rapidly growing&#13;
modern industrial sector. But this performance was accompanied by an inability&#13;
to spend the amounts allocated in the plans for agriculture and primary education.&#13;
These latter failures contributed in no small measure to the unequal income&#13;
distribution that Iran has most often been criticized for.&#13;
The Fifth Plan recognized the critical importance of agriculture and&#13;
rural development. Despite this alleged shift of policy, a Bank mission con-&#13;
cluded that the support given to these programs in the Plan document was inadequate,&#13;
the performance targets were too optimistic and that Iran's development strategy&#13;
retained its brban bias.  In particular, it appeared that the programs of rural&#13;
development were unbalanced, with emphasis being placed on programs that would&#13;
benefit only a few and leave untouched the mass of the rural poor.&#13;
There has since been a revision of the planned agricultural strategy,&#13;
to give more recognition to the importance of the private sector and the need&#13;
for supports and incentives to foster its growth in agricultural activities.&#13;
But actual policies still remain unchanged; in particular, preoccupation with&#13;
the stabilization of consumer prices has resulted in depressed agricultural&#13;
producer prices and incomes. Since agriculture provides a livelihood for 40 per-&#13;
cent of the population, it remains the most challenging sector to develop.&#13;
The revision of the Fifth Plan following the oil price increase emphasize!&#13;
the promotion of basic and petrochemical industry. The major constraints are&#13;
recognized to be those of trained manpower, including management, and the infra-&#13;
structure of ports, roads and communications. In spite of the large investments&#13;
being poured into these sectors, both are characterized by long gestation lags,&#13;
with the result that there is much doubt about whether the large investments in&#13;
these and other sectors can be absorbed productively. The increased oil revenues&#13;
appeared to offer two alternative courses: maintenance of the old pace of&#13;
development (which was itself rapid) while systematically working on the bottle-&#13;
necks that would impede faster development,and thus banking or investing abroad&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
for a time the surplus earnings;    or alternatively, acceleration of the rate of&#13;
development by the injection of most of the increased earnings in the domestic&#13;
economy, with the objective of changing Iran's economic structure within a short&#13;
time. In the event, the latter course was chosen.&#13;
III.5   Patterns in the Medium-Term Performance of the Mineral Economies&#13;
A second way of distinguishing among the mineral economies is by refer-&#13;
ence to certain aspects of their medium-term performance. Section II argued that&#13;
the policy choices of mineral economies were critical in determining their saving&#13;
rates, inflation rates, agricultural production growth rates, and their success&#13;
with export diversification. This section analyzes these indices of medium-term&#13;
performance and attempts to glean some country patterns.&#13;
Six criteria are used, independently of each other, 1/ to partition the&#13;
mineral economies into sub-groups. These criteria are: long-term capital stock&#13;
per capita, stage of exploitation, size (population), agricultural potential,&#13;
degree of central planning, and length of mining history. Table XX presents&#13;
relevant data on growth rates of agricultural production, inflation rates, marginal&#13;
saving rates and export diversification (measures by share of primary commodities&#13;
in total exports) for these country groups.&#13;
These data suggest the following patterns:&#13;
(a) Growth of Agricultural Production has, in recent years, been&#13;
higher in large countries and in those with high agricultural&#13;
potential but lower in the low- and moderate-capital countries&#13;
as well as in the 'centrally planned economies'.&#13;
(b) Inflation is higher in the large countries, in the high-capital&#13;
countries and in countries at the early stages of mineral&#13;
exploitation, but is lower in the 'centrally planned economies'.&#13;
(c) Marginal Saving Rates have been higher in large countries; they&#13;
have been highest in the high-capital group, followed by the&#13;
moderate- and low-capital groups; they have also been highest&#13;
in the middle exploitation-stage countries, followed by the&#13;
early- and late-exploitation stage countries; but have&#13;
worsened, in recent years, in the 'centrally planned economies'.&#13;
(d) Export diversification as measured by the share of primary&#13;
commodities in total exports has been most successful in&#13;
countries at the late mineral-exploitation stage; for the&#13;
moderate-capital group countries followed by the low- and&#13;
high-capital groups respectively; and for the 'centrally&#13;
planned economies; but worse for the 'old' mining countries&#13;
than for the 'new'.&#13;
1/ In other words, the ceteris paribus clause does not hold; or, what is the&#13;
same thing, the underlying statistical concept is that of simple correlation,&#13;
not partial correlation.&#13;

The most important conclusion that emerges from the above analysis is&#13;
that none of the six criteria unequivocally sifts 'good' from 'bad' performers&#13;
for any of the four performance indices.&#13;
The implication to be drawn is that the prospects for the mineral&#13;
economies, as reflected in their recent performance, are moderately good:&#13;
although these economies are, in a historical sence, a rare species, there are&#13;
sufficient differences in their achievements to suggest that some of them are&#13;
laying the basis for a successful transformation.    On the other hand,&#13;
there is enough evidence of poor performance on the part of others&#13;
to suggest that the transformation is unlikely to occur if present trends&#13;
continue.&#13;
Some of the most encouraging findings of the above analysis are that:&#13;
agricultural production has grown faster in large countries and those with high&#13;
agricultural potential; marginal saving rates are higher in the large countries&#13;
and highest in countries in the middle exploitation stage; export diversification&#13;
has been most successful in the late- exploitation-stage countries and in the&#13;
moderate-capital countries.&#13;
There are discouraging findings too. In particular, inflation has been&#13;
higher in the large countries, somewhat higher in the high-capital group and&#13;
higher in the early and late mineral-exploitation stage countries than in the&#13;
middle stage countries. It is distressing that agricultural production has grown&#13;
much more slowly in the low- and moderate-capital groups than in the high-capital&#13;
group.   The finding that the marginal savings rate is lowest for the low-capital&#13;
group and highest for the high-capital group, although understandable, suggests&#13;
that the former countries are not making the higher saving effort that they are&#13;
required to. And finally, the poor export diversification performance of the&#13;
'old' relative to the 'new' mining countries is indicative of a failure in the&#13;
attempt at transformation.&#13;
In a nutshell, the performance of the mineral economies has been worst&#13;
with respect to inflation, and mixed with respect to agricultural production,&#13;
saving and export diversification.&#13;
III.6   Long-Term Prospects in the Mineral Economies&#13;
The long-term prospects of the mineral economies rest, ultimately, on&#13;
their medium-term performances: in particular, on their choices of in-estment&#13;
priorities and on their achievements in reducing the problems of inflation,&#13;
agricultural stagnation, low saving and export concentration. Our evaluation of&#13;
the mineral economies' performance makes possible an assessment of their long-&#13;
term prospects in two ways:&#13;
(a) In principle, the long-term prospects of individual mineral&#13;
economies are, other things equal, directly related to the&#13;
level of their long-term capital stock per capita. It is&#13;
therefore of interest to determine whether their economic&#13;
performance in recent years reinforces this general principle&#13;
or offsets it. In other words, is the economic performance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
of the low-capital group countries superior to that of the&#13;
moderate-capital group, and is that of the latter group&#13;
5uperior to that of the high-capital group?&#13;
(b) Under the assumption that the cross-section view of the&#13;
mineral economies grouped according to their stage of&#13;
mineral exploitation may be used as a guide to the long-&#13;
term evolution of a stylized mineral economy moving from&#13;
early to late mineral exploitation, 1/ we may ask: does&#13;
the recent economic performance of the mineral economies&#13;
suggest that the stylized mineral economy is likely to&#13;
transform its economy into a highly-diversified and growing&#13;
one as its late stage approaches?&#13;
The indices of economic performance used are: agricultural growth,&#13;
price stability, marginal savings, export diversification and investment&#13;
priorities, all of which were analyzed above. The accompanying charts summarize&#13;
the evidence by distinguishing, for each of the two criteria, ideal-type&#13;
pessimistic, optimistic and actual economic performances.&#13;
Essentially the pessimistic ideal-type view assumes (i) that the&#13;
economic performance of the low capital group is better than that of the moderate&#13;
capital group, while that of the high capital group is least impressive; and&#13;
(ii) that performance improves from the early to the late stages of exploitation.&#13;
On the other hand, the optimistic views assume (i) that economic&#13;
performance is better for the low capital group than for the moderate capital&#13;
group, and least impressive in the high capital group; and (ii) that it improves&#13;
from the early through to the late stages of exploitation.&#13;
The indices of actual performance are based, of course, on Sections&#13;
II.4 and II.5.&#13;
The evidence in these charts suggests that the long-term prospects of&#13;
the mineral economies, as judged by their recent economic performance, are&#13;
moderately good. This is because:&#13;
(a) Their actual performance is superior to the pessimistic views&#13;
for both questions posed above, but falls short of the&#13;
respective optimistic views: in other words, performance&#13;
correlates positively with level of long-term capital stock&#13;
per capita, but not as perfectly as the pessimistic view would&#13;
suggest; and performance correlates positively with the stage&#13;
of mineral exploitation but not as perfectly as the optimistic&#13;
view would suggest.&#13;
(b) The most outstanding positive finding is that export diversi-&#13;
fication improves with the stage of mineral exploitation.&#13;
1/   The problems associated with applying cross-section evidence to time-series&#13;
projections are well-known: for the purpose at hand, however, these may&#13;
be glossed over.&#13;

depend on an improved performance in keeping down inflation, increasing agricul-&#13;
tural growth rates and, in the low-capital group, in improving saving performance.&#13;
Further, although successful export diversification would seem to be within the&#13;
reach of the mineral economies, it would clearly depend on an improvement in the&#13;
choice of investment priorities, particularly in the low- and moderate-capital&#13;
group countries. The task ahead is not an easy one, but the rewards to informed&#13;
economic choices and policies are likely to be high. That, at any rate, is'what&#13;
is suggested by this attempt to glean the long-term prospects for the mineral&#13;
economies on the basis of 'verbal correlations'. 1/&#13;

IV. ECONOMIC RENTS: THE DISTRIBUTION OF GAINS FROM MINERAL EXPLOITATION AND&#13;
MINERAL DEVELOPMENT POLICY 1/&#13;
IV.1 Introduction&#13;
Preceding sections of the paper have assumed away the problems&#13;
associated with the conversion of minerals from their physical state to a flow&#13;
of financial resources. The mining industry, ever since minerals entered&#13;
international trade, 2/ has involved the participation of direct foreign investors.&#13;
In particular, after the eighteenth century, the industrializing countries, in&#13;
addition to greatly increasing mining activity at home, began to seek minerals&#13;
abroad notably in the developing countries of today. The distribution of gains&#13;
from mineral exploitation have, especially following the 1938 nationalization of&#13;
the Mexican petroleum industry, increasingly become a bone of contention between&#13;
the mineral economies and the mining companies. The subsequent watershed was,&#13;
of course, the OPEC action in 1973 which culminated in a quadrupling of oil&#13;
prices.&#13;
What we have christened the conversion problem raises a complex set&#13;
of issues. First and foremost, it raises the question of the rate at which&#13;
mineral reserves should be exploited. 3/ A second set of questions relates to&#13;
the general regulation of the foreign mining companies (FMCs) and in particular&#13;
to the policy options through which mineral economies may share in mining rents&#13;
and exercise leverage on long-run investments and exploration in their mining&#13;
sectors. And thirdly, it raises the question of producer cooperation in the&#13;
mining, marketing and processing of individual minerals. Subsequent sections&#13;
1/ The title of this section and a fair measure of the ensuing discussion are&#13;
based on Hughes (1975). Other basic sources for this section are: Diaz&#13;
Alejandro (1976) and Gillis (1977).&#13;
2/ Precious metals excluded.&#13;
3/ An additional issue that has received little or no attention in the literature&#13;
is the rate of exploration. Like the rest of the mining industry, exploration&#13;
has large economies of scale. Since no returns can be assured, exploration&#13;
funds must be provided strictly as risk capital. Rough estimates indicate&#13;
that in the early 1970s approximately US $300-350 million were spent annually&#13;
on non-fuel mineral exploration activity worldwide (excluding centrally&#13;
planned economies), but only 15 percent of this was in the developing countriet&#13;
In the past, the FMCs have done most of the exploration (Mexico was the&#13;
exception). More public exploration companies, notably in Brazil, have been&#13;
successful in exploring on a large scale, and similar steps are being con-&#13;
sidered throughout the world. Bilateral and multilateral technical and&#13;
financial assistance on the one hand, and greater producer cooperation on&#13;
the other, may be expected to play a greater role in the future. See Bosson&#13;
and Varon (1977) pp. 31-34.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
discuss each of these sets of issues, but running through each of these is the&#13;
underlying concept of rents in the mining industry, a subject to which we turn&#13;
first. The major conclusion of the ensuing analysis is that the mineral economies&#13;
would do best to concentrate on exacting non-monopolistic mineral rents through&#13;
appropriate tax systems and modes of participation in the mining industry, rather&#13;
than the more uncertain monopolistic rents which have received so much attention&#13;
in recent years.&#13;
IV.2 Rents in the Mining Industry&#13;
It is possible to distinguish five different types of rent in the mineral&#13;
industry. First, arising from the basic characteristic of minerals, namely their&#13;
exhaustibility, is an element of scarcity rent. The essential factor in the&#13;
determination of scarcity rent is the rate of consumption of the mineral relative&#13;
to total stocks (reserves): thus, petroleum enjoys a substantial scarcity rent&#13;
while salt, limestone and other minerals used in the construction industry have&#13;
negligible scarcity rent. Quite clearly, as total stocks diminish scarcity rents&#13;
increase, ceteris paribus. In general scarcity rent will increasingly dominate&#13;
market price as depletion occurs.&#13;
Differences in the quality of ores, in the ease of mining, or in&#13;
location, give rise to Ricardian-type differential rents. Thus bauxite from&#13;
Jamaica, Guyana, Surinam enjoys locational advantages with respect to the&#13;
U.S. market; Nigerian petroleum is well known for its low sulphur content,&#13;
and off-shore drilling in the North Sea for its hazards.&#13;
Monopolistic rents are a third type and can arise in two ways:&#13;
firstly, through producer-country cartels,and secondly as a result of the&#13;
structure of the international market for minerals. To take the latter first,&#13;
the existence of excess profits due to the oligopolistic structure of inter-&#13;
national markets in many minerals is not disputed, although difficult to prove.&#13;
There are no open competitive markets for bauxite, iron ore and nickel. On the&#13;
other hand, as the 1973 OPEC price rise demonstrated, it is possible for mineral&#13;
economies, under some circumstances, to increase monopolistic rents by in effect&#13;
taxing the consumer. Whether or not taxes on specific minerals can be shifted&#13;
by the FMCs on to consumers depends, to a large extent, on the degree of competi-&#13;
tion in the industry: given few substitutes, the more competitive, the greater&#13;
the incidence of the tax on consumers. 1/   The two kinds of monopolistic rents&#13;
therefore differ in that the mineral economies can tap the first only by&#13;
increasing oligopolistic excess profits at the expense of consumers, while the&#13;
second is at the expense primarily of the FMCs. The Jamaican 1974 bauxite&#13;
"oproduction levy" may have been borne largely by the FMCs. 2/&#13;
The presence of quasi-rents is quite general, but there is reason to&#13;
believe that these rents are higher in the mining industry. Since capital is&#13;
immobile in the short-run, and the mining industry is highly capital-intensive,&#13;
capital enjoys a sizeable quasi-rent. Taxing this element is likely, however,&#13;
1/ Gillis and McLure (1975), p. 392.&#13;
2/ Ibid.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88 -&#13;
to drive future investments away. Other factbrs also enjoy quasi-rents, and&#13;
in mining, this is particularly true for managerial and technical know-how.&#13;
Given that the mineral economies' capabilities in these areas are still inade-&#13;
quate, these rents are high. But they are less easily taxed than the former&#13;
because they are more mobile. These quasi-rents are best tapped by imitation&#13;
and displacement than by taxation.&#13;
Finally, reference may be made to windfall rents that arise in the&#13;
mining industry periodically and are largely due to sudden demand increases&#13;
in the presence of low short-run supply elasticity. Whether these rents should&#13;
be taxed is questionable (because the industry is also prone to demand increases),&#13;
unless fortuitous losses are given favorable tax treatment.&#13;
In all of the above, rent is conceived as the surplus earned by a&#13;
particular factor of production over and above the minimum earnings necessary&#13;
to induce it to do its work. Although there is some ambiguity about the rela-&#13;
tive costs and benefits of tapping quasi-rents, most mineral economies lay nominal&#13;
claim to the scarcity, differential, monopolistic and windfall rents. Exacting&#13;
these rents however poses many problems.&#13;
However desirable it may be, it is as a rule impossible for a govern-&#13;
ment to collect all rents. The major difficulty is that of distinguishing rent&#13;
from supply price, both because of the government's relative ignorance of the&#13;
industry and because the supply price depends on the producer's perception of&#13;
risks. The latter is difficult to judge and risk must, in any case, be&#13;
negotiated. The absence of arms-length transactions in many of the relevant mar-&#13;
kets is a complicating factor. Thus, all ex ante taxes on rents are plagued&#13;
by uncertainty. On the other hand, ex post taxes amount to a marginal tax rate&#13;
of 100 percent, which has obvious implications for incentives, even if transfer&#13;
prices were controlled. Thus rents are uncertain, vary with risk (and hence also&#13;
with the tax instrument used to tap rents) and involve actual costs of collection.&#13;
Any attempt to tap rents must contend with these difficulties. Before appraising&#13;
the policy options for mineral economies in their attempt to maximize their rent&#13;
extractions, a brief account of the factors that ought to determine the rate of&#13;
mineral exploitation is in order.&#13;
IV.3 The Rate of Mineral Exploitation&#13;
A fixed and known stock of an exhaustible resource may be regarded as&#13;
a capital asset. The representative owner has to decide whether to exploit it&#13;
and at what rate. If the marginal costs of exploitation and the present and future&#13;
prices of the resource are known to the owner, assumed to be a price taker, the&#13;
decision is simple. Exploitation should be at a rate such that the price of the&#13;
resource, net of costs, increases at the same rate as the ruling rate of interest.&#13;
Efficiency calls for all forms of investment having the same yields: Venezuela&#13;
1/ Hotelling (1931) and Solow (1974).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
should sow petroleum into new factories only while the return to these assets is&#13;
higher than the appreciation of oil in her ground.&#13;
It is well known that even if we limit ourselves to competitive&#13;
markets within a single country, to homogeneous deposits and no uncertainty,&#13;
doubts arise regarding the efficiency of markets. The institutional features&#13;
of uncertainty, high capital intensity, and large foreign mining companies&#13;
(whose rate of time preference differs from that of the mineral economy) can&#13;
only imply that the rate of exploitation of mineral reserves is a policy decision,&#13;
par excellence.&#13;
The opportunity cost of the various rents from a mineral depost is the&#13;
discounted value of these rents if the mineral were to be exploited in the&#13;
future under other circumstances. In particular, changes would follow from:&#13;
(a) future. movement of real prices due to changes in demand,&#13;
supply and technology;&#13;
(b) future possibilities of increasing domestic gains through&#13;
greater domestic supply of inputs, greater domestic&#13;
multiplier effects and/or greater domestic taxes due to&#13;
better tax administration;&#13;
(c) future increases in absorptive capacity and hence in the&#13;
productivity of investments; and&#13;
(d) expected increases in domestic demand for the mineral which may&#13;
dictate its preservation for later own-use, given the non-&#13;
competitive nature of the market, imperfect knowledge, long&#13;
gestation periods, fluctuating demand and/or national&#13;
security considerations. 1/&#13;
It is noteworthy that uncertainty with respect to the trend of future&#13;
prices makes present extraction plus investment in financial or real assets&#13;
abroad an attractive alternative, as it has to Kuwait and S. Arabia. In the&#13;
majority of the mineral economies however, including the petroleum economies,&#13;
mineral exploitation is being pushed ahead at full steam except as dictated by&#13;
production cut-backs to maintain prices. The reason is not difficult to find.&#13;
Development is of the utmost priority, and speed is believed to be of the&#13;
essence. It is difficult to quarrel with this objective, except in cases in&#13;
which development expenditures are increasing at such phenomenal rates that they&#13;
cannot be productively absorbed, and the manna leads to indigestion! The recent&#13;
cut-backs in Iran and Nigeria, and the open recognition in the 1975-80 Saudi plan&#13;
that actual spending is likely to fall far short of allocations, 2/ are all&#13;
symptoms of such over stretching.   From a policy point of view then, the decision&#13;
to invest mineral rents in financial or real assets abroad as an alternative to&#13;
'over-spending' them domestically, is one that must receive the close attention&#13;
1/ Such own-use preservation is most fervently being carried out by India and&#13;
Venezuela, but is generally advocated,but not necessarily followed, by many&#13;
mineral economies.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 -&#13;
of those mineral economies in this very fortunate position, including the&#13;
moderate capital group countries. For mineral economies whose 'over-spending'&#13;
is fuelled by foreign borrowing, these strictures are equally, if not more,&#13;
applicable.&#13;
IV.4 Mineral Taxation and Development Policy&#13;
From the point of view of the mineral economies, the objective of&#13;
mineral taxation is simple: to capture all scarcity, differential, monopo-&#13;
listic and windfall rents, while letting the investor make the return necessary&#13;
to induce him to invest. As noted earlier, this is difficult in an imperfectly&#13;
competitive and uncertain world, and one in which the taxing government's&#13;
knowledge of the industry is inferior to that of the investor, and transfer&#13;
prices are the rule that prove the exception. In principle the easiest way to&#13;
capture all these rents is for the government to run the mines, a decision&#13;
Mexico took in 1938. Although the participation of state-owned enterprises&#13;
in mining is increasing, it is not surprising that countries differ substantially.&#13;
Among the non-fuel mineral economies, Zambia and the Congo People's Republic&#13;
own more than 90 percent of their mining industries while the proportion in Jamaica&#13;
was, until recently, under 10 percent, and that in Bolivia, Chile and Indonesia&#13;
is around 50 percent. 1/ Not only do high entry barriers in the marketing&#13;
sphere limit such participation, but the efficient operation of mining activity&#13;
is itself very demanding. And even though it is increasingly possible to contract&#13;
out the difficult parts of the production process, e.g., the managerial and&#13;
technical inputs, the latter markets are still highly underdeveloped and it is&#13;
certainly not easy to combine disparate inputs efficiently. Thus the role of&#13;
FMCs is likely to remain significant in the mining industry, and hence also the&#13;
role of taxation as an instrument of exacting rents. 2/&#13;
The oldest form of mineral resource tax is the royalty. Specific&#13;
royalty taxes are simply based on tonnage, and their main advantages are:&#13;
(a) ease of assessment and administration;&#13;
(b) stability of revenue, since production tends to be&#13;
more stable than profits.&#13;
But the specific royalty tax, being independent of ore quality and price,&#13;
is able to tap only the scarcity rent Element. The ad valorem royalty taxes&#13;
differential rent and is therefore preferable.   It is also relatively easily&#13;
administered, although somewhat more demanding than the specific royalty; it is&#13;
likewise relatively stable, though again less 80 than the specific royalty.&#13;
1/ Gillis in Gillis (1978).&#13;
2/  Reference may be made to mineral processing as an additional way`'f exacting&#13;
rents. But this route is plagued by various barriers to entry that were&#13;
described in Section II.3.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
Its major disadvantage is that it drives a wedge between private and social&#13;
costs and therefore discourages optimal exploitation of the mine and the optimal&#13;
reprocessing of material discarded at an earlier processing stage.&#13;
As a means of capturing mineral rents and at the same time minimizing&#13;
the excess burden of taxes, income and excess profits taxes score eminently.&#13;
Their main advantages are that they impose fewer constraints on operating decisions,&#13;
are more sensitive to rents and can allow for exploration and development expendi-&#13;
tures. Their main disadvantage is that it is difficult to calculate income and&#13;
excess profits, and hence to tax away the rents, because of the twin problems of&#13;
uncertainty and transfer pricing. They have the further disadvantage of leading&#13;
to revenue instability, as was clearly shown by the experience of Zambia in 1971. 1/&#13;
The efficiency and rent-sensitivity of income and excess profits taxes must be&#13;
weighed against their relative instability and greater administrative demands.&#13;
It is clear that whatever the method of rent exaction, there will be&#13;
some effect on investment, discovery and output. But newer forms of revenue&#13;
collection have been designed which preserve the spirit of the income and profits&#13;
tax, retain the advantages of private operation and reduce political risks, hence&#13;
increasing potential taxable rents.   These are   production sharing and contracting,&#13;
and were first used in Indonesia, and more recently in Peru, in both cases for&#13;
petroleum. In production sharing, the foreign investor supplies foreign exchange&#13;
investment, management and export markets; the repayment of capital, interest&#13;
and profits is predetermined and takes the form of a share of output at agreed&#13;
prices; and ownership and control remain in national hands. Production contracting&#13;
is a variant of the latter, with contractors operating parts of the mining&#13;
activity on an output-share basis. Both approaches overcome some of the diffi-&#13;
culties of estimating operating costs and prices; but they are not finely tuned&#13;
to costs and hence to rents, and are therefore most appropriate where rents are&#13;
relatively high. Their major disadvantage is that they require extremely skill-&#13;
ful and sophisticated negotiation, and supervision.&#13;
The resource rent tax is the type of mineral tax that has most recently&#13;
been advocated. 2/ It focuses on the observation that rent is inversely related&#13;
to risk of loss, and risk of 'Loss is increased if the spectrum of probabilities&#13;
associated with the rate of return is increased. It is argued that each oi the&#13;
uIsual tax systems--specific and ad valorem royalties, proportional and progressive&#13;
profits tax, etc.--increases the risk of loss because it renders the rate of&#13;
return uncertain.  Tne resource rent tax, by allowing for an appropriate rate of&#13;
return, does not increase risk beyond what it would be in the absence of taxation.&#13;
Thus, it maximizes potential rent. It is a profits tax that begins to be levied&#13;
(at a very high rate) when a certain threshold rate of return on investment has been&#13;
realized, and may be made progressive. The Papua-New Guinea bauxite project uses&#13;

Zambian mineral-tax revenues almost halved dueto the fall in profits resulting&#13;
from a fall in copper demand.&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- '92 -&#13;
such a tax scheme, although somewhat simplified. The advantage of the resource&#13;
rent tax is obvious. It is administratively similar to an income tax, and is&#13;
just-as variable; however, like the latter, it may be combined with royalties.&#13;
It is less demanding of administrative resources than taxes that have to be&#13;
negotiated frequently, but it requires a strong direct tax administration.&#13;
Its major disadvantages are that it tends to grant long tax holidays which&#13;
are politically unpopular in many mineral-economies and, as with income taxes,&#13;
profits may easily be shifted to tax havens.&#13;
Other forms of taxes on minitg activity -and minerals abound; of&#13;
these, only two will be mentioned here. Jamaica has pioneered the levying of&#13;
taxes on the value of the final output, by taxing bauxite in proportion to the&#13;
market price of aluminum (a step that was necessitated by the absence of an&#13;
open price for bauxite). The similarity of this tax to those based on posted&#13;
prices is apparent. Auctioning exploitation rights is a device that theoreti-&#13;
cally assures host countries of all rents. It is infrequently used first&#13;
because of uncertainty about the size and quality of reserves, and second&#13;
because very often the bidders are dismally few in number. It is a more viable&#13;
option in petroleum due to the more standardized technology, the ease of&#13;
marketing and to the large number of potential bidders.&#13;
A recent study of comparative mining taxes showed wide variance&#13;
in the reliance on these modes of taxation. 1/ At one extreme was Bolivia, wit!&#13;
almost exclusive reliance on royalties and no taxes on income, although the&#13;
largest mining company is government owned. Liberia, Zaire and Jamaica differ&#13;
little from Bolivia in this respect, although they differ in the degree of&#13;
government ownership in the industry. On the other hand, Indonesia boasts of&#13;
a combination of royalties, income and excess profits taxes, three wholly owned&#13;
government corporations and sophisticated production sharing and contractual&#13;
operations. Zambia, Chile and Peru belong with Indonesia, although the former&#13;
two have ceased to charge royalties.&#13;
It is obvious that the choice between the available mechanisms for&#13;
exacting mineral rents cannot be made on qualitative grounds alone. The benefi&#13;
and costs associated with alternative means of tapping rents will differ some-&#13;
what among countries. But some general statements may still be made:&#13;
(a) Given that an essential policy problem is the identifi-&#13;
cation of rents, some reliance on royalties is to be&#13;
encouraged in spite of its drawbacks; in addition to its&#13;
ease of administration, the relative stability of royalties&#13;
is a major argument for combining it with other forms of&#13;
taxation;&#13;
(b) The rent-sensitivity and efficiency of the income and&#13;
excess profits taxes render them highly desirable instru-&#13;
ments of mineral taxation; increasing attention to&#13;
these taxes in countries such as Bolivia, Zaire and&#13;
Jamaica is to be encouraged; investments in strengthening&#13;
the tax administration in this direction would pay off&#13;
handsomely;&#13;

&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -&#13;
(c) A major factor limiting the exaction of rents by&#13;
governments is their relative ignorance of the&#13;
intricate details of the technology, management and&#13;
marketing of their minerals; given that learning&#13;
will tend to follow doing, and that supervision is&#13;
easier from inside than outside, government or domestic&#13;
participation in the mining industry through such new&#13;
instruments as production sharing and contracting is&#13;
to be encouraged, albeit at a cautious pace;&#13;
(d) The resource rent tax can, in principle, be operated&#13;
by any country that has an income or profits tax;&#13;
although it gives rise to tax holidays, it may be&#13;
combined with a specific royalty in the early years&#13;
and still retain its advantage of decreasing commercial&#13;
risk; and it has the further advantage of encouraging&#13;
exploration and development;&#13;
(e) Since countries that attract FMCs by offering lower&#13;
tax rates are likely to be giving up rents, the&#13;
importance of producer coordination in tax policy is&#13;
obvious;&#13;
(f)  Since changes in bargaining strength between the FMC&#13;
and the host government are generally exploited to&#13;
change contract terms, it is advisable to allow for&#13;
such changes at the start; this renders the disposition&#13;
of rent variable in the medium term and fixed in the&#13;
short term, thus allowing flexibility but reducing&#13;
risk of loss for the FMC (and hence increasing potential&#13;
rent). 1/&#13;
IV.5 Cooperation Among the Mineral Economies&#13;
Cooperation among the mineral economies has most commonly taken the&#13;
form of producer cartels aimed at increasing monopolistic rents. But it may&#13;
take at least two other forms; first, tax policy may be coordinated, either&#13;
overtly or following the 'price leadership' model. Thus, the 1974 tax increase&#13;
on bauxite by Jamaica was quickly followed by similar increases in the other&#13;
Caribbean bauxite economies. Secondly, mineral economies may attempt economic&#13;
integration of common activities such as mineral processing, and research and&#13;
development (R &amp; D) related to their minerals. There are as yet few examples&#13;
of such integrated activity. But the rationale for joint processing is evident&#13;
given scale economies, and that for joint R &amp; D may be argued on the basis of&#13;
the high and uncertain costs associated with such activity. 2/&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

The exploitation of possible gains from cartelization has been&#13;
viewed with renewed enthusiasm since the 1973 OPEC price increase. 1/ Thus,&#13;
bauxite producers who are members of the International Bauxite Association&#13;
(IBA) have also successfully increased their annual earnings by a few hundred&#13;
percent since 1974. 2/ On the other hand, the success of the phosphate rock&#13;
producers has been mixed. Morocco trebled its phosphate prices in January 1,&#13;
1974 and most other producers, including the U.S., followed suit. The success&#13;
of this move hinged in part on the increased price of hydrocarbon-based ammonia&#13;
fertilizer which accounts for 55 percent of the fertilizer market (phosphate-&#13;
based fertilizer accounts for 25 percent, and potash-based fertilizer for the&#13;
other 20 percent). But demand for phosphate rock nose dived in mid-1975, and&#13;
prices have not recovered since. 3/ A phosphate rock cartel formed among&#13;
Morocco, Jordan, Tunisia, Togo, Senegal and Algeria in late 1976 was largely&#13;
unsuccessful in 1977 in maintaining prices, and Algeria and Togo have since&#13;
withdrawn from the group. Clearly the factors affecting possible gains from&#13;
cartelization vary across minerals. However the success of the bauxite&#13;
producers attests, at least, to the fact that oil is not an exception. 4/&#13;
One of the most sophisticated analyses, to date, of gains to&#13;
producers from the cartelization of exhaustible resources studies the prospects&#13;
for oil (OPEC), bauxite (IBA), and copper (CIPEC). 5/ Using a dynamic frame-&#13;
work, potential monopoly profits were calculated on the basis of:&#13;
(a) estimates of demand and supply elasticities;&#13;
(b) the effect of adjustment lags in demand and supply on&#13;
short-term monopoly profits.&#13;
The most important results were, first, that the relative gains are made&#13;
primarily in the first five years, and second, that the gains from carteliza-&#13;
tion are highest for bauxite (60 to 500 percent over the competitive solution,&#13;
depending on the rate of exhaustion), next highest for oil (50 to 90 percent)&#13;
and least for copper (8 to 30 percent). The most significant factors explain#ng&#13;
the poorer performance of copper are the lower market share of CIPEC, and the&#13;
quick response of the secondary copper market to price changes. An additional&#13;
revealing fact is that, at all times, IBA's monopolistic bauxite price is&#13;
within a few dollars of the "limit price" at which the production of alumina&#13;

(1974).&#13;
2/ Bergsten (1976).&#13;
3/ The Economist (May 1974; August 1975).&#13;
4/ The argument that oil is the exception has been most forcefully made by&#13;
Krasner (1974), while contrasting arguments are made by Mikdashi (1974)&#13;
and Bergsten (1973), (1974).&#13;

from other areas becomes economical. The major limitation of the study is its&#13;
neglect of the effect of higher prices on exploration and hence on the discovery&#13;
of new reserves. All the same, it too supports the view that oil is not an&#13;
exception, although it does not refute the view that both oil and bauxite are&#13;
exceptions.&#13;
Three broad factors may be said to determine possible gains from&#13;
cartelization: the degree to which the cartel dominates the market, substi-&#13;
tution possibilities and the political problem of achieving producer cooperation.&#13;
The degree to which the cartel dominates the market determines, in part, the&#13;
short-run supply elasticity. Substitution possibilities determine the elasti-&#13;
city of demand as well as, in part, that of supply; and the two factors together&#13;
determine the potential for short-run monopoly gains which, as noted above,&#13;
seem to account for a large proportion of cartelization gains. Moreover, it&#13;
has been observed that price raising may be a good idea even if it encourages&#13;
substitutes,provided the short-run gains are large enough to allow diversifi-&#13;
cation of the producer's economy and increase its flexibility. 1/ Further&#13;
it is possible through subtle pricing and marketing strategies to increase&#13;
rents without pushing consuming countries to develop substitutes which require&#13;
heavy initial investments and start-up costs, or to use available but higher&#13;
priced substitutes. 2/ Of course substitution among minerals can be avoided&#13;
by supra-cartels; however, these are likely to be extremely difficult to hold&#13;
together.&#13;
The political problem of achieving producer cooperation is greater&#13;
the more differences there are among the producers with respect to initial&#13;
conditions (income levels, foreign exchange reserves, ore quality, etc.) and&#13;
expectations (including ideological differences). Even so there is likely to&#13;
be some trade-off between these difficulties and the potential gains from&#13;
concerted action.&#13;
The upshot of these observations is simply that given some market&#13;
dominance, the potential gains from cartelization, if any, require detailed&#13;
knowledge of the industry and of the market. Thus although it is difficult to&#13;
predict what other minerals may successfully join the ranks of oil and bauxite,&#13;
it is clear that a prerequisite of such action is the intensive study of the&#13;
mining industry and mineral markets by the producer countries. The objectives&#13;
of such a study would be to determine the price levels that would stay clear&#13;
of "limit prices" at which substitutes become attractive, and to reveal the&#13;
potential gains from cartelization as a means of encouraging group cohesion.&#13;
Until such knowledge becomes available to the producer countries, the exaction&#13;
of monopolistic rents must remain a highly uncertain proposition.&#13;

IV.6 A Concluding Note&#13;
Prospects for tapping monopolistic rents would seem to exist in&#13;
some minerals. But it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the mineral&#13;
economies would do best to first concentrate on exacting the scarcity,&#13;
differential and windfall rents by devising appropriate tax systems and modes&#13;
of participation in the mining industry. As their knowledge of the industry&#13;
increases, the feasibility of tapping monopolistic rents is likely to increase.&#13;
Although difficult to prove, it would seem that oil and bauxite lend themselves&#13;
more easily to the exploitation of gains from cartelization than do the other&#13;
minerals. If so, then attaching more immediate priority to exacting non-&#13;
monopolistic rents is not only a more efficient use of resources, but also&#13;
follows the logical sequence because it will help to accumulate knowledge of&#13;
the industry for the more difficult task of tapping monopolistic rents.&#13;
On the other hand, (a) min±ng tax policy, (b) joint mineral&#13;
processing, (c) joint R &amp; D efforts and (d) exchanging mineral industry&#13;
information, would each seem to be fertile ground for greater producer&#13;
cooperation than there is at present.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
V.  POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS iOR THE MINERAL ECONOMIES&#13;
V.1 Summary and Conclusions&#13;
A. The mineral economies, we have seen, have certain unique&#13;
nda2ntages:  some measure of their required 'primitive accumulation' is for&#13;
them a natural endowment, they have less constraining fiscal and foreign&#13;
exchange gaps, and can, to some extent, base their industrialization&#13;
strategies on mineral processing.&#13;
B. On the other hand, relative to non-mineral economies, the&#13;
mineral economies are more susceptible to a number of economic problems;&#13;
low marginal saving, high unemployment 3nd dualism, high inflation, low&#13;
growth in agricultural production, high export earnings and fiscal instability&#13;
and poor export diversification performance.&#13;
C. Notwithstanding these general tendencies, there is significant&#13;
variation in economic performance within the group of mineral economies, which&#13;
suggests tnat their long-term prospects (as judged by their prospects for trans-&#13;
formation and growth on the one hand, and employment and distribution on the&#13;
other) aze moderately good:&#13;
(i) First, a qualitative analysis of the divergences between&#13;
actual and 'ideal' investment priorities in five types of&#13;
mineral economies (small high capital, large moderate capital,&#13;
small moderate capital, large low capital and small low&#13;
capital) suggests that although divergences are on average&#13;
quite high, the 'right' investment priorities tend to be&#13;
emphasized in some mineral economies in each of these five&#13;
groups. Thus, there is no clear country pattern in the&#13;
incidence of such divergences. However, there is some&#13;
tendency for the large mineral economies, and for the moderate&#13;
ard low capital group mineral economies to show greater&#13;
divergences. And, in general, the mineral economies tend&#13;
to overemphasize mineral processing, underemphasize agri-&#13;
cultural production and labor-intensive manufacturing,&#13;
while paving appropriate attention to import substitution&#13;
and edtucation and training. For lack of information, it is&#13;
not possible to judge the priority attached to R &amp; D&#13;
capability and to small-scale enterprise development, but&#13;
it is likely that these needs are being underemphasized,&#13;
particularly in the high capital group and large countries&#13;
respectively.&#13;
(ii)  Second, a 'verbal corre'Lation' analysis of the relative&#13;
medium-term economic perforomances of the mineral economies,&#13;
using groupings based on six independent criteria, shows&#13;
mixed results. The encouraging findings are that: agri-&#13;
cultural production has grown faster in the large countries,&#13;
and in the countries with high agricultural potential;&#13;
marginal saving rates are higher in the large countries&#13;
and in the middle mineral exploitation stage, and export&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -&#13;
diversification has been most successful in the moderate&#13;
capital countries. The discouraging findings are that:&#13;
inflation has been high in the high capital group, and&#13;
not much lower in the moderate and low capital groups, and&#13;
has been higher in the early and late mineral exploitation&#13;
stage countries than in the middle stage countries; agri-&#13;
cultural growth has been lower in the low and moderate&#13;
capital groups relative to the high capital group; and&#13;
marginal savings have been lowest in the low capital group.&#13;
In a nutshell, the performance of the mineral economies&#13;
has been mixed with respect to agricultural production,&#13;
saving and export diversification, but poor with respect&#13;
to inflation.&#13;
This heterogeneity suggests that the long-term prospects of the&#13;
mineral economies lie in between alternative pessimistic and optimistic ideal-&#13;
type scenarios. It is clear however that much will depend on an improved&#13;
performance in keeping down inflation, increasing agricultural growth rates&#13;
and, in the low capital group, improving saving performance. Further, although&#13;
successful export diversification in some mineral economies suggests that it&#13;
may be within reach of the others, it would clearly depend on an improvement&#13;
in the choice of investment priorities, particularly in the large and in the&#13;
low and moderate capital group countries.&#13;
The task ahead is not an easy one; but the rewards to informed&#13;
economic choices and policies are likely to be high.&#13;
D. Finally, an analysis of comparative mining taxes and mining&#13;
sector policies suggests that the mineral economies have considerable scope&#13;
for reforming these policy areas in their attempt to increase their share of&#13;
scarcity, differential and windfall rents. The fiscal linkage, as we have seen,&#13;
is after all the major externality of the mining industry. Cooperation among&#13;
producers to increase their share of monopolistic rents is seen to be a much&#13;
more uncertain route to increasing mining rents, not least because it requires&#13;
detailed knowledge of the entire mining industry. However, producer cooperation&#13;
in the fields of joint R &amp; D activity,joint mineral processing and mining&#13;
tax policies, although still uncommon, is likely to pay handsome dividends.&#13;
The policy recommendations offered in various parts of the paper&#13;
are summarized below.&#13;
V.2 A Policy Framework for the Mineral Economies&#13;
Various policy objectives and policy instruments have been identified&#13;
for the mineral economies. 1/ The different policy objectives relate to the&#13;
goals of growth and transformation on the one hand, and employment and&#13;
1/ Throughout, and in this section, policy recommendations are offered on the&#13;
basis of the 'rational actor' model of policy making. An alternative, and&#13;
more realistic conceptualization of the policy making process is the 'incre-&#13;
mentalist' model which recognizes, in particular, that policy making is&#13;
plagued by uncertainty and conflict. Although the paths of reform are narrow&#13;
it is to be hoped that Hirschmanian reform mongers in the mineral economies&#13;
will rise to the occasion.   See Lindblom (1958) and Hirschman (1973).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 99 -&#13;
distribution on the other, in many ways. In particular, one .cannot over-&#13;
emphasize the critical importance of the level, sequence and sectoral allocation&#13;
of investment in determining the mineral economy's success with the above goals,&#13;
and hence of the policy environment for medium-term economic decision making.&#13;
The policy instruments may be classified into three kinds: micro-&#13;
economic, macro-economic and institutional. Three observations are in order&#13;
here. First, as stressed earlier, there are two 'prices' whose influences are&#13;
pervasive throughout the mineral economy, and which must receive early attention&#13;
if the consequences of their neglect are to be reversed. These are: a) 'the'&#13;
mining sector wage rate; and b) 'the' exchange rate. Their pervasiveness is a&#13;
major reason whay they are likely to be difficult instruments to use. But the&#13;
long-term prospects of most mineral economies are bleak if an appropriate&#13;
incomes policy and a carefully designed foreign trade regime are not instituted&#13;
as early as possible in the mineral rent cycle.&#13;
Second, although mineral processing is not the panacea it is often&#13;
claimed to be, it can contribute to the industrialization of many mineral economies&#13;
both because its benefits exceed its costs and because of its potential linkage&#13;
effects. Nonetheless, as stressed earlier, important barriers to entry in the&#13;
industry are: in particular, tariff barriers in importing countries, and&#13;
discriminatory pricing against processed commodities by shipping conferences.&#13;
This is a second pervasive problem area; but its solutions lie more in the&#13;
international arena.&#13;
Third, as an examination of the charts below suggests, a staggeringly&#13;
high proportion of the policy instruments are institutional. In a developing&#13;
economy, institutional change is important. The problem is that it is much&#13;
more difficult to bring about institutional change than to modify a few prices.&#13;
The task ahead is therefore a difficult and uncertain one. This can only increase&#13;
the importance that must attach to the mining wage rate and the exchange rate.&#13;
The chart below, in addition to listing policy objectives(and&#13;
corresponding policy instruments), identifies sub-groups of mineral economies&#13;
to which each of these policy objectives is most relevant, and gives country&#13;
examples.&#13;
At the end of three major studies of economic policy making in&#13;
Latin America, an astute observer wrote: "in fine, the roads to reform are&#13;
narrow and perilous, they appear quite unsafe to the outside observer however&#13;
sympathetic he may be, but they exist." 1/ The success of the mineral economies&#13;
in attaining their goals rests in large measure on the size of their respective&#13;
mineral reserves, but perhaps even more importantly on whether they can tread&#13;
the roads to reform that are summarized below.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            The essential advantage of the mineral
            economies lies in their possession of a resource that is
            readily converted into a large financial flow, much of it in
            the form of foreign exchange. However, the mineral economies
            must contend with the fundamental fact that their mineral
            wealth is exhaustible. Thus, mineral economies tend to be
            especially characterized by technological and wage dualism;
            they are prone to neglect their non-mineral sectors; their
            export earnings are often marked by instability; and they
            are subject to strong inflationary pressures. Further, to
            maximize their benefits they must exact the economic rents
            inherent in the production and sale of their mineral
            resources, thus requiring to pay special attention to
            mineral taxation, participation in the mining industry, and
            negotiations with foreign mining companies. Finally, the
            mineral economies need to adopt a strategy which, through an
            efficient sequencing and sectoral distribution of
            investments, will create a diversified and growing economy
            before their mineral rents wither away. These problems and
            objectives, the paper concludes, require a wide array of
            policy changes that are largely institutional in nature.
