0DJUSTMENT POLICIES AND PROBLEMS IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES&#13;
A Study of the Problems Created by, and Policies Toward,&#13;
the Imports of Manufactures from Developing Countries&#13;
A Background Study to the World Development Report, l919&#13;
This study examines the problem posed by the need to adjust to imports&#13;
from developing countries. It- begins with an attempt to define the terms of&#13;
adjustment and adjustment policy. The overall context within which adjust-&#13;
ment has to occur is then discussed, and attention is drawn both to the un-&#13;
favorable macroeconomic environment and to the bias against changes brought&#13;
about by imports from developing countries. The theory of adjustment costs&#13;
and their political implications is examined, followed by a review of the&#13;
evidence on the exact impact of the exports of manufactures from developing&#13;
countries and on the nature of the protectionist response as a political phe-&#13;
nomenon. This leads to a definition of the possible forms and goals of adjust-&#13;
ment policy. The effectiveness of existing policies is reviewed, immediately&#13;
following a discussion of the relevant differences between major developed&#13;
countries. Finally conclusions are drawn about what improved adjustment pol-&#13;
might consist of in different country contexts.&#13;
The study was prepared as a background paper to the second Forld_Dve     -&#13;
ment Report and is based on a review of some of the relevant literature and on&#13;
interviews with officials in a number of governments and international organi-&#13;
zations. The work was carried out between October 1978 and the beginning of&#13;
February, 1979.&#13;

I. INTRODUCTION&#13;
A. Scope of the Paper&#13;
"Adjustment to change is a necessary condition of economic growth -&#13;
indeed the growth process is -little more than a sequence of adjustments of this&#13;
kind." (Blackhurst, Marian and Tumlir 1978 p.l.) L/   Virtually all economic policy&#13;
has implications for the ability to adjust by ilts effect either on the purely&#13;
economic aspects of change or on its political acceptability. /2 It would not be&#13;
inappropriate to define the goal of economic policy as the determination of what&#13;
to adjust to and how to adjust in the most efficient and socially acceptable&#13;
manner.&#13;
Even if adjustment is a central part of the process of economic&#13;
evolution, it does not follow that policy decisions by Government are necessary.&#13;
This depends on the extent to which economic change is considered to be within&#13;
the boundaries of the political process. Laissez faire might be described as the&#13;
first modern adjustment policy, and it makes unnecessary any political decision&#13;
about the desirability of an economic change. /3&#13;
/1   This view of economic development is particularly clearly expressed by&#13;
Schumpeter (1951, p.66) "Development.in our sense is then defined by the&#13;
carrying out of new combinations." Scott (1976) has elaborated this way of&#13;
looking at the process of growth.&#13;
/2   The importance of social, economic, and political resistance to change is an&#13;
essential part of Schumpeter's theory of- development and especially of the role&#13;
of the entrepreneur (Schumpeter, 1951, pp. 86-9).&#13;
/3   Of course, even in the heyday of laissez faire, Great Britain was the only&#13;
country to adhere to free trade. In other cases, the tariff was used to&#13;
impede change, when trade was the source of the pressure -for adjustment.&#13;
However, in the 19th century protection in the now industrialized countries&#13;
was at least as much a change-promoting as a change-retarding policy, being a&#13;
major means -of infant-industry promotion.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2-&#13;
However, even in such countries as the United States and West Germany, where the&#13;
primacy of the market is still largely accepted, it is no longer possible for&#13;
Government not to take a position on the desirability of a major economic change.&#13;
The fundamental nature of the adjustment problem and its central&#13;
place in the political process of the industrial democracies has several impli-&#13;
cations for this paper. An obvious point is that the problem created by the need&#13;
to adjust to trade, in general, and trade with the developing countries, in particular,&#13;
must be seen in the context of the total impact of the forces of economic change.&#13;
This is so, even though, as will be argued below, there are respects in which the&#13;
problems created by trade are sui generis - at least politically- and thus merit&#13;
special treatment. Furthermore, the difficulties are to a considerable extent&#13;
political and our treatment must, therefore, consider both the political context&#13;
and the likely political effect of various policy measures. In addition, many of&#13;
the measures that are likely to make sense in the context of adaptation to trade&#13;
are those appropriate to overall development. Industrial policies, for example,&#13;
and action to improve the working of factor markets, while quite general in focus,&#13;
are an important part of any process of adjustment to trade. However, it is&#13;
necessary to go further: since political acceptabili-ty is crucial, policies to&#13;
affect income distribution, income security and regional development will all&#13;
have an effect on the adjustment to trade. Even macroeconomic policy will play&#13;
a key role, since without full employment microeconomic adjustment will often be&#13;
thwarted by the political process. However, macroeconomic policy, in turn, pre-&#13;
supposes microeconomic flexibility, creating an intractable "chicken-and-egg"&#13;
problem. /4 Finally, adjustment is an alternative to essentially defensive&#13;
measures, and policy to achieve the former can be understood only in relation to&#13;
/4    On this point, Blackhurst, Marian and Tumlir (1978, p.89) argue "Demand&#13;
stabilization policies presuppose an economy in which competition ensures,&#13;
through changing relative prices, a flexible adaptation of supply to changes&#13;
in the pattern of demand."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3-&#13;
the characteristics and effects of the latter. This is particularly important,&#13;
because some of the measures that masquerade, so to speak, as adjustment assis-&#13;
tance are defensive measures by another name.&#13;
Some narrowing of the scope is clearly necessary. For this reason,&#13;
macroeconomic policy is largely ignored and other policies are examined almost&#13;
entirely from the point of view of their effect on adjustment to changes re-&#13;
quired by trade, in general, and trade with developing countries, in particular.&#13;
Even here the focus is on imports of manufactured goods, and only a few examples&#13;
of particular policies are considered. Furthermore, the underlying case for&#13;
adjustment rather than for protectionism is not examined, there being many&#13;
excellent recent discussions, for example Blackhurst, Marian and Tumlir (1977 and&#13;
1978), World Bank (1978), Balassa (May 1978), and OECD (1979 and June 1979).&#13;
Discussion here is limited to pointing to the relatively small impact of imports&#13;
from developing countries - in fact, the role of these imports as a scapegoat for&#13;
much deeper problems.&#13;
B. Definitions&#13;
For our purposes an adjustment policy is defined as any policy or&#13;
set of policies that makes possible-the acceptance of, rather than resistance to,&#13;
market penetration by the exports of developing countries in developed-countries.&#13;
This is an extremely bro-ad definition as far as means are concerned, but is a&#13;
narrow one as far as the goal is concerned. Since, as Ohlin (1975, p.8) points&#13;
out,'the meaning of 'adjustment assistance' is not self-evident', it will not be&#13;
a surprise that other definitions exist. The closest to ours is UNCTAD's (1978,&#13;
Summary and Conclusions, para.(ii)):"adjustment assistance programmes should pave&#13;
the way for further import liberalization for the competitive products of&#13;
developing countries." However, this definition is mcre restrictive, since it&#13;
assumes assistance and also concentrates on liberalization, rather than the avoid-&#13;
ance of new protection. Fels (1974, pp. 250-1) states that adjustment assistance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 4 -&#13;
aims at "assisting the rehabilitation or compensation of those who have been put&#13;
at a disadvantage as a result of increased import competition.   In doing so, it&#13;
involves a shift from the provision of security by actual or potential trade&#13;
limitations to security by assisting restructuring." This definition focuses on&#13;
a specific means of bringing about adjustment, namely, assistance to displaced&#13;
factors of production, but is broader than ours to the extent that it covers all&#13;
imports. Miles' definition (1975, p.15) is restricted to industrial policies:&#13;
"The term adjustment assistance is customarily taken to mean specific policy&#13;
measures directed towards facilitating the adaptation of domestic industries to&#13;
import competition."&#13;
It will be useful for the purposes of the discussion to make certain&#13;
distinctions. In the first place, an adjustment policy will be- seen to work by&#13;
reducing the social costs, redistributing the private costs and in these ways&#13;
increasing the political acceptability of change.   Adjustment policies will be an&#13;
alternative to purely defensive measures. Some policies are aimed largely at&#13;
increasing the efficiency with which resources are transferred in the economy;&#13;
others, and compensation above all, are aimed almost exclusively at redistribu-&#13;
ting private costs and making protection less politically desirable. It may also&#13;
be useful to see adjustment policy as including measures to adapt to change, to&#13;
accelerate change and to anticipate change. "Adjustment assistance", however, is&#13;
more narrow than adjustment policy. It is perfectly possible to imagine a success-&#13;
ful adjustment policy (namely, reliance on the market), which involves no assistance&#13;
at all. Thus, adjustment assistance is taken to refer to policies involving actual&#13;
government expenditure.&#13;
While the criterion for evaluating the success of policy is a narrow&#13;
one and relates to trade with developing countries, policies need not be. Even&#13;
when judged solely from the point of view of the developing countries' exports,&#13;
policies need not be strictly trade-related. For this reason it will be necessary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 5 -&#13;
to examine whether a particular policy can,- must, or should be restricted to change&#13;
created by trade, or rather whether it should be seen as a general measure&#13;
potentially beneficial or harmful from our more hiarrow point of view.&#13;
C. Outline and Summary of Conclusions&#13;
a.   The Context for Adjustment to Imports from Developing Countries&#13;
A period of slow growth and high unemployment is one in which&#13;
adjustment to the impact of new overseas competition is particularly difficult.&#13;
Some protectionist bias against imports from developing countries could be seen&#13;
even in the boom years of the 1960s and early 1970s, but it seems to have become&#13;
worse since 1974. Moreover, evidence of declining flexibility and increasing&#13;
inability to operate Keynesian macroeconomic policies emerged during the 1960s, and&#13;
these tendencies also worsened, to the extent that they did not cause, the malaise&#13;
of the period-after 1974. Faced with what seemed to be unmanageable problems, an&#13;
increasing number of governments resorted to short-term, selective, and defensive&#13;
measures to shore up existing production; of these measures discriminatory protec-&#13;
tion against imports from developing countries was among the foremost. Indeed,&#13;
these imports have played something of the role of scapegoat in recent years.&#13;
A detailed analysis of the problems of the developed countries is&#13;
beyond the scope of this paper. Two points do, however, emerge. The first is&#13;
that we can at least look for policies that might reduce the bias against imports,&#13;
in spite of the generally unfavourable environment.   Moreover, some adjustment&#13;
policies are inherently general and will, therefore, contribute both to our imme-&#13;
diate goal and to the wider one of increasing the flexibility of the industrial&#13;
economies. The second point is that the various analyses of the overall problems&#13;
of industrial countries, and the specific issue of adjustment to imports, differ&#13;
fundamentally in their starting points. Some commentators have taken protectionist&#13;
positions, and their influence, while not yet decisive in any major country, has&#13;
been considerable. However, even among those who favour adjustment to trade there&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
are major differences both of analysis and recommendation. Some authors see the&#13;
entire problem as the consequence of "overmighty" government, and recommend, both&#13;
for the specific issue of adjustment to trade and for the wider goal of effi-&#13;
cient growth, a policy of much diminished intervention of all kinds. Others stress&#13;
the inherent defects of the market, and consider that it is only very recently&#13;
that government intervention has become counter-productive. They stress the need&#13;
to move to "positive adjustment" policies, which include a host of general inter-&#13;
ventions, especially in factor markets, to improve the workings of the market.&#13;
Yet others stress the failures of the market mechanism itself, and tend to see the&#13;
solution as direct government involvement in sectoral planning and industrial&#13;
restructuring, taking into account the particular goal of adjusting to imports from&#13;
developing countries. These differences, and related differences among countries,&#13;
determine in some measure the choice of acceptable adjustment policies.&#13;
b.   The Adjustment Problem and the Goals of Adjustment Policy&#13;
Transitional social costs created by imports are the result of&#13;
market imperfections and most analyses indicate that they are modest. These&#13;
transitional costs may even be negative if account is taken of the growing&#13;
employment opportunities created elsewhere. The real issue is that of the dis-&#13;
tribution of private costs, since there is evidence of large transfers through&#13;
protection to sector- or location-specific factors in the short- to medium-run.&#13;
The lack of adequate compensation, combined with the receptivity of the political&#13;
system to protectionist pleas, explains the prevalence of protection.&#13;
There is some reason to believe that industries directly affected by&#13;
import competition from developing countries are likely to find survival parti-&#13;
cularly difficult, and that their failure will impose high costs on some of the&#13;
owners of sector-specific factors. All the evidence on the numbers of workers&#13;
displaced by imports from developing countries indicates that these are modest,&#13;
especially in relation to those displaced by productivity growth. One recent analys&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
indicates that in gross terms only about 3 percent of the total labor force in manu-&#13;
facturing in industrialized countries might be theoretically displaced by imports&#13;
from developing countries between 1976 and 1986, while net change would be zero. Almost&#13;
half of the workers affected seem to be women, and there is some evidence that the&#13;
effect would be concentrated in poorer regions. The costs to workers in the tradition-&#13;
ally vulnerable industries do not seem to be particularly high when comparison is made&#13;
with industries where-unskilled and semi-skilled workers receive much more generous&#13;
wages (such as automobiles and steel). However, there is some evidence that a sig-&#13;
nificant proportion of the workers displaced by imports from developing countries do&#13;
become permanently unemployed. There is no reason to suppose that these imports will&#13;
have any effect on the overall relative level of wages in the foreseeable future.&#13;
Turning to the political dimension, it appears that the industry associations representing&#13;
capitalists and managers, rather than organized labor, are the decisive lobby for these&#13;
industries. Moreover, with the possible exception of textiles, where the large fibre&#13;
producers have thrown their weight alongside that of the host of smaller textile and&#13;
clothing firms, the lobbies of industries affected by imports from developing countries&#13;
do not appear particularly powerful, at least until they started to affect the steel&#13;
industry - if only marginally. What may be more important is the general lack of any&#13;
strong pressures against the use of protection against imports from developing countries,&#13;
-the main differences with the case of imports from the major developed countries being&#13;
the fear of retaliation, in the latter, and the widespread acceptance that low-cost&#13;
imports are "unfair", in the former.&#13;
Adjustment policy is, in economic terms, aimed at lowering the social&#13;
costs, largely through a reduction in the duration of unemployment, and redistribut-&#13;
ing the private costs. The sorts of policies thought appropriate tend to depend&#13;
on the ideologies outlined above. However, the key aim of any adjustment policy is&#13;
to make acceptance of the particular change more politically feasible, and all&#13;
alternatives have to be evaluated in this light.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 8-&#13;
c.   An Evaluation of Existing Policies&#13;
What will work and is appropriate obviously depends on the&#13;
circumstances, traditions and ideologies of individual countries, and in the&#13;
case of Europe of groups of countries. The following questions should be kept in&#13;
mind: Is the country generally market-oriented or interventionist? Is the&#13;
interventionism forward-looking or defensive? Does there exist a comprehensive and&#13;
generous welfare state, likely to make redundant any further assistance at least&#13;
to displaced workers? Is trade a large part of the economy, or can its effects&#13;
be readily separated out? Is there noticeably greater resistance to trade-related&#13;
changes than to others? Differences in these respects between the United States,&#13;
Europe and Japan explain the first's reliance on a trade-related adjustment&#13;
assistance program largely aimed at providing compensation to workers, the second's&#13;
reliance on a wide range of general policy measures combined with (frequently&#13;
defensive) industry-specific interventions, and the last's emphasis on a strategy&#13;
of sectoral forward planning.&#13;
It is impossible to summarize at a reasonable length the discussion&#13;
of the microeconomic policies that can be viewed as conducive to adjustment.&#13;
However, three conclusions can be drawn: the first is that many of-the interven-&#13;
tions which are supposed to help adjustment - industrial restructuring, for&#13;
example - are, in fact, largely defensive. The distinction between defensive and&#13;
more positive orientations cuts across those among the different immediate goals&#13;
of individual policies. Thus, industrial policies can be defensive or aimed at&#13;
achieving efficient change and the same applies to regional or manpower policies.&#13;
A second point is that the various kinds of intervention designed to make markets&#13;
work better can consist either of direct attempts to remove existing distortions&#13;
or of subsidies to offset their effects. It is particularly when failures are&#13;
thought to be the spontaneous result of market forces and not open to direct poli-&#13;
tical action that subsidies are most readily used. The danger here is that even&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-9-&#13;
"spontaneous" distortions do not occur independently of government action to&#13;
offset their effects. Thus, inability to achieve either regional mobility or&#13;
wage flexibility for labor may be increased by income security, regional and&#13;
manpower policies designed to offset the consequences of just those rigidities.&#13;
Finally, while an orientation towards the survival of existing vulnerable industry&#13;
is unlikely to prove other than counter-productive, and the use of emergency&#13;
"safeguard'" protection should, therefore, be tightly controlled, carefully de-&#13;
signed general industria]., regional and-manpower policies can be useful in&#13;
improving the workings of the economy, and income maintenance and compensation&#13;
programs can help to redistribute the burden. However, none of these general&#13;
policies has, at least in the context of low growth and high unemployment,&#13;
assuaged protectionist pressures, perhaps because of the political role of owners&#13;
of sector-specific factors subject to large and uncompensated windfall losses.&#13;
It is because of the essentially political nature of the adjustment&#13;
problem that emphasis must be placed on policies designed to help those affected-&#13;
by a particular source of change, namely imports. What is then provided is a&#13;
visible alternative to the often futile attempt to preserve the status quo.    Thus,&#13;
the impact of trade can be used as a criterion for assistance to owrkers of factors&#13;
employed in aff,cted firms and to the regions in which they are located.    Programs&#13;
designed to provide especially high compensation to workers displaced by trade, or&#13;
to assist firms to restructure their operations in those circumstances, exist in&#13;
the United States, Canada and the Netherlands. They face the general problem&#13;
that delays and uncertainty are inevitable when benefits are provided only to&#13;
those already affected by a particular source of change. The consequence tends&#13;
to be that benefits come too late to be relevant to decision makers at the time of&#13;
lay-off or contraction. Moreover, the-costs borne by the owners of relatively&#13;
sector-specific factors are quite inadequately compensated in these programs.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10 -&#13;
Thus, the actual political benefits are modest. These programs also tend to&#13;
suffer from the drawback of trying to keep firms in business instead of compen-&#13;
sating them for closure, and they may in this way maintain the protectionist lobby&#13;
in being.&#13;
The problem of delay, in particular, can be dealt with by using an&#13;
industry, rather than a specific source of change, as the organizing principle&#13;
for assistance. There is always the problem that the boundary of an industry is&#13;
arbitrary, but at least in this way a host of firms can be-identified as eligible&#13;
almost at a stroke. The greatest practical disadvantage is that, instead of&#13;
using the industry as a vehicle for identifying those eligible for compensation,&#13;
manpower or community assistance, there is a natural tendency to attempt to shore&#13;
up the industry itself. Furthermore, there can be great injustice if the early&#13;
victims are uncompensated because an industry-wide assistance program does not yet&#13;
exist.&#13;
d.   Towards Improved Adjustment Policies&#13;
Within the context of a market economy compensation of those affected&#13;
by imports seems to be the only feasible direct alternative to protection. How-&#13;
ever, estimates of the size of the transfers to factors employed in protected&#13;
industries indicate that full compensation is not feasible. What might be managed,&#13;
however, is lump sum compensation of those who leave an industry, combined with&#13;
a long-term but clearly announced program of gradual liberalization or strictly&#13;
time-bound emergency protection. The relevant point is that in the long term&#13;
almost all factors of production are mobile, and transfers to them from protection&#13;
correspondingly negligible. In effect, the compensation program would benefit the&#13;
more marginal factors of production and the (strictly controlled) protection would&#13;
sustain the incomes of those who have few alternative opportunities in the short&#13;
to medium term. However, if such protection were to be provided, it would be&#13;
important to ensure that no niew factors were attracted into the industry because&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
of it. Programs of this kind could be provided in the context of decisions to&#13;
liberalize specific imports or when it is determined that a given industry is&#13;
suffering injury from imports. The existence of a general program to provide&#13;
compensation to those whose factors of production are employed in firms which&#13;
are affected by imports, on the lines of the adjustment assistance program of&#13;
the United States, would provide a useful source of information on when an industry&#13;
was facing growing difficulties. In countries where trade is a much larger pro-&#13;
portion of GNP than in the United States such a program could be oriented just to&#13;
imports from developing countries. However, if no program to help those involved&#13;
in particular input-affected firms exists, it will be necessary to establish a&#13;
careful monitoring system to identify the problems of an entire industry early.&#13;
Of more general policies designed to improve the flexibility of an&#13;
economy, the following seem to be potentially useful: regional policies that&#13;
exclude 'ronl 'ncentives industries that are vulnerable to imports, concentrate&#13;
on the provision of general infrastructure, and, above all, lead to a richer&#13;
endowment in poorer regions of highly-skilled labor; manpower policies designed to&#13;
offset the many taxes now imposed on employment, including replacement of some of&#13;
the conditional payments in social security systems with lump sums;-government&#13;
support for training in firms and direct provision of such training; reduction in&#13;
the obstacles to worker mobility inherent in many current practices in housing and&#13;
pensions, in particular; assistance to industrial research and development, but&#13;
not direct support to senescent industry with the - usually futile - aim of&#13;
buying it back       to viability; and, in certain cases, government support for&#13;
the dynamic industries of the future on the successful model of Japan.&#13;
Some commentators on adjustment adopt a different position, in which&#13;
general support for the market process is replaced by sectoral planning, or even&#13;
planning at a national levelswith the aim of adapting to imports. This approach&#13;
seems unlikely to work, with sector-specific plan8 being more likely to engender&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
well-articulated pleas frjr protection that antything else, and being diffliult to&#13;
implement as well. Similarly, there seems to be little point in attempting to&#13;
anticipate the structural changes that will be needed and attempting to impose&#13;
them by fiat.&#13;
The willingness to adjust tather than to resist requires an initer-&#13;
national consensus. Trade policies will need modification in a number of&#13;
countries simultaneously, since otherwise the adjustment capacity of one can be&#13;
swamped by the trade diversion created by the protectionism of others. Developing&#13;
countries, for theic part, need to explore ways to raise the perceived political&#13;
cost of protection and to persuade the industrialized countries that adjustment&#13;
is in their own interests and not a sacrifice of them to a purely charitable cause.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
II. THE OVERALL CONTEXT FOR ADJUSTMENT TO&#13;
IMPORTS FROM DEVELOPING COUNTRIES&#13;
The ability and willingness of the developed countries to absorb&#13;
increased imports from the developing countries is determined in substantial&#13;
measure by their overall economic situation. Without the full employment of&#13;
labour and the ability to adjust speedily to economic change, strong resistance&#13;
is likely to be the main response to the emergence of new competitors. It is,&#13;
therefore, impossible to consider the problem of adjustment to the imports from&#13;
developing countries without at least a brief analysis of this overall context.&#13;
Indeed, it would be perfectly defensible to argue that the problem created by&#13;
the developing countries' exports is solely a manifestation of the larger issue&#13;
of macroeconomic imbalance. Blackhurst, Marian and Tumlir (1978) set out to do&#13;
just this, their argument being, in essence, that the current overall problems of&#13;
the developed countries and the resistance to exports from developing countries&#13;
derive from the same roots and require the same cure.&#13;
While the overall context is important for our more immediate concern and&#13;
merits consideration, it will not be the main-focus of our treatment of the ad-&#13;
justment problem. One reason is that there exists already a very large body&#13;
of literature on the macroeconomic problems of the developed countries,quite&#13;
apart from the reams written on the theoretical basis of macroeconomic policy.&#13;
Moreover, the macroeconomic environment and its microeconomic causes and con-&#13;
sequences must be taken largely as. given. There is little that can be done&#13;
about the problem in the near future (except perhaps for avoiding making it&#13;
worse by resort to protectionism). Thus, we are still left with the major&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
question of whether, given this environment, policies can be adopted that&#13;
will facilitate, cr at least not prevent, a rather modest inflow of exports&#13;
from developing countries. This leads to our view, subsequently elaborated,&#13;
that the failure of adjustment to imports from developing countries is not&#13;
determined in any simple way by the overall environment or by failures of&#13;
general policy. There has always been a certain discrimination against&#13;
change that derives from the emergence of new competitors in world markets.&#13;
For that very reason, there may exist policies that can at least reduce that&#13;
discrimination (or even promote these adjustments). This is not to deny the&#13;
existence of some constraints at an overall level, but merely to indicate&#13;
the existence of room for manouevre, which might be of some value. Thus we&#13;
are searching for policies that may help to reduce the bias against change&#13;
brought about by trade, in general, and imports from developing countries in&#13;
particular. If, as turns out to be the case, some of these can help to im-&#13;
prove the overall flexibility of the industrial economies and permit faster&#13;
growth and more efficient use of capacity, they are, so to speak, "twice&#13;
blessed."&#13;
A. The Period of Expansion&#13;
a. The Boom&#13;
The experience of the 1930s led to a decisive change in the basic&#13;
goals of the Western countries: in the first place, Governments made an&#13;
/ This view is clearly and cogently expressed in Sampson (1978), expecially&#13;
p. 3: "As far as the level of activity in industrialized countries is&#13;
concerned, it is possible to assign to it an important, but not dominant,&#13;
role in the recent increase in protectiont'.&#13;

_ 15 -&#13;
explicit commitment to full employment - in certain cases in legislation;&#13;
secondly, the obligation of Government to guarantee economic security to the&#13;
entire population was almost universally accepted;-/ thirdly, there was a&#13;
fairly rapid return or reaffirmation of the role of private enterprise end&#13;
a competitive market as the source of income growth;iJ and finally, at the&#13;
international level there was a commitment to the restoration of convertible&#13;
currencies, of a system of multilateral payments and of liberalized trade.&#13;
1945 to 1973 witnessed a boom unique in world history. The Govern-&#13;
ments of the developed countries were able to achieve all their objectives,&#13;
in spite of the fears that the pursuit of full employment would prove incon-&#13;
sistent with price stability;/ that Governments would reject the constraints&#13;
of international rules on trade and payments whenever they clashed with some&#13;
powerful (perceived) domestic interest; or that the welfare state would prove&#13;
2/ The official acceptance of the full-employment goal was made among others&#13;
in Great Britain, Canada, Australia, the United States, and France.&#13;
(See Garratty, 1978, pp. 230-1).&#13;
3] For the United Kingdom a decisive step was the publication of the Beveridge&#13;
Report in 1942.&#13;
/ The most interesting (and most successful) case of restoration of the&#13;
market was that of West Germany with its "social market" policy. See on&#13;
this Blackhurst, Marian and lumlir (19T8, pp. 3, 72). For a slightly&#13;
different view, which emphasises the continued role of the state, see&#13;
Shonfield (1965, pp. 239-40).&#13;
2/ On the liberalization of trade, see Baldwin and Kay (1975, pp. 112-3), who&#13;
point out that the postwar Administration's "basic belief was that an&#13;
expansion of world trade in a nondiscriminatory manner would significantly&#13;
improve the prospects for world peace by promoting closer economic, social&#13;
and political ties". Mention must also be made in this context of the&#13;
process of European economic integration, which was a major spur to the&#13;
growth of world trade.&#13;
/ Beveridge (1944, p. 199) wrote: "There is a real danger that sectional&#13;
wage bargaining may lead to a vicious spiral of inflation". I am indebted&#13;
for-this quotation to Scott (1979).&#13;

inconsistent with a thriving private sector. Employment remained high and&#13;
unemployment low; and both output and trade grew at unprecedented rates,&#13;
with the latter leading the former. Furthermore, this success at the "core"&#13;
helped the "periphery" to achieve unprecedented rates of economic growth./&#13;
As Blackhurst, Marian and Tlmlir indicate (1977, p. 7),during the&#13;
war- and depression-ridden thirty-five years from 1913 to 1948 the volume of&#13;
world production increased at an average annual rate of around 2 percent.&#13;
Over the same period the volume of world trade appears to have grown by only&#13;
about one half of 1 percent per annum. Between 1948 and 1973, however, aggre-&#13;
gate world production was increasing at an average annual rate of about 5 per-&#13;
cent. Productivity growth was about three percent per annum. World trade&#13;
grew at 7 percent per annum. The contrast between the two periods could not&#13;
be more striking.&#13;
Let us look a little more closely at the developed countries them-&#13;
selves:  the growth of GNP averaged 4 percent per annum between 1950 and 1975&#13;
(World Bank 1978, pp. 9-10) and averaged 5 percent in the decade prior to&#13;
1973. The volume of their exports rose by 7 percent per annum in the decade&#13;
of the 1950s and the rate of growth rose to 8.5 percent between 1960 and 1975.&#13;
Unemployment was kept at extremely low and steady levels, indicating that&#13;
demand was both high and stable: between the two wars the unemployment&#13;
rate reached a peak of 13.1 percent in the United Kingdom, 17.2 percent in&#13;
Germany, and 24.7 percent in the United States (Lal 1977, Table 2); by con-&#13;
trast, in the same countries between 1955 and 1970 the rate never exceeded&#13;
3.5 percent in the United Kingdom, 3.4 percent in West Germany, and 6.7 percent&#13;
V   Lewis (1978, p. 67) remarks that "when the developed revive and grow faster&#13;
than ever, as between 1950 and 1973, the developing also grow faster&#13;
than ever."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17 -&#13;
in the United States.   (Ibid., Table 1(A) ).   It is also worth noting the&#13;
extent of economic adjustment and, most obviously, the large transfer of&#13;
labor from agriculture to the rest of the economy. Between 1959 and 1974 the&#13;
fall in total employment in agriculture was 6.1 million in Japan, 1.9 million&#13;
in France, 1.9 million in Germany, and 1.4 million in Italy (OECD, 1972 and&#13;
1978). The corresponding proportionate reductions in the agricultural labor&#13;
force were 47 percent, 43 percent, 51 percent, and 31 percent. The ability&#13;
of these economies to absorb labor was indicated also by the extent of immi-&#13;
gration.  In Germany, for example, cumulative net immigration, largely of&#13;
workers, between -1959 and 1973 was 4.6 million (Ibid.).&#13;
What about imports from the developing countries? In spite of&#13;
some resistance the growth was dramatic: imports of manufactures by the&#13;
industrial countries from developing countries grew at a compound rate of&#13;
12 percent in volume between 1963 and 197L (GATT 1978, Table D.1),i which&#13;
exceeded the growth in the volume of manufactures traded among the developed&#13;
countries for the same period, at 11 percent. Furthermore, the inclusion of&#13;
the initially large, sluggish and atypical category of non-ferrous metals gives&#13;
a downward bias to the estimates for the developing countries' exports.&#13;
Keesing and Plesch (1976) estimate the real growth-of developing countries'&#13;

effects of war-time'dislocation and the enormous influx of refugees.&#13;
In 1950 the unemployment rate was 6.8 percent (Lal, 1977, Table 1(A) ).&#13;
2/ Manufactures are defined as SITC 5-8. The country definitions are those&#13;
of the United Nations.&#13;

- 18 -&#13;
exports to the developed countries in SITC 5 through 8 less 68 (non-ferrous&#13;
metals) at 22 percent per annum for 1967 through 1973. Unfortunately, ex-&#13;
ports of agricultural commodities were much less buoyant, partly because of&#13;
protection. The growth rate of exports of food from developing countries tc&#13;
the developed was 3.3 percent per annum in volume between 1960 and 1973&#13;
(United Nations June 1977, Special Table F).&#13;
ITis buoyant period generated a certain euphoria among commentators&#13;
on the developed countries and advisers of the developing, as performance&#13;
consistently exceeded expectations.  Shonfield (1965) writes that "continu-&#13;
ing prosperity and uninterrupted growth on the scale of recent years are&#13;
possible in the future" (p. 63), although he notes the need for political will&#13;
end skill. He also remarks that "the control over the business cycle, which&#13;
owes so much to Keynes's work, has been one of the decisive factors in estab-&#13;
lishing the dynamic and prosperous capitalism of the postwar era" (p. 64).&#13;
Moreover, as Balassa notes (1978, p. 6), "while the United Nations foresaw&#13;
an increase of only 60 percent [in developed countries' imports of manufac-&#13;
tures from developing countries] during the sixties, these imports increased&#13;
fivefold between 1960 and 1970." It is far from surprising that more and more&#13;
developing countries began to shift slowly towards more outward-looking trade&#13;
policies.&#13;
b. The Emerging Symptoms of Decay&#13;
It can be argued that problems with which we have become familiar&#13;
in recent years first showed themselves in the 1960s, although so hidden&#13;
were they that it is only in the light of hindsight that certain tendencies&#13;
now appear to be of decisive importance. Indeed, it is possible to argue&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19 -&#13;
that current difficulties are the product of essentially fortuitous events&#13;
of the early 1970s. -     However, even if the features to be discussed be-&#13;
low were not, in fact, significant in creating the post-1973 decline in&#13;
growth rates, they have had some effect both on the ability to recover and&#13;
on the nature of-resistance to the exports of the developing countries. The&#13;
latter, in pa-rticular, was affected by the steadily growing willingness of&#13;
,governments to engage in discretionary, selective intervention, to protect&#13;
existing firms, regions or other threatened groups. This, in turn, had&#13;
implications for the willingness to accept imports from developing countries,&#13;
which were likely to have their greatest initial impact on backward regions&#13;
and vulnerable groups. In addition, there followed an increased willingness&#13;
to use-discretionary, selective and discriminatory trade policy measures,&#13;
namely,-various forms of non-tariff barrier. S&#13;
A-closely related development of the post Second World War peri-od&#13;
was the growing direct government involvement in industry, and it was sig-&#13;
nificant that this growing commitment was taking place within a markedly&#13;
changed context, namely, the virtual disappearance of the tariff as an instru-&#13;
ment for infant industry protection. Not only had tariff levels become ex-&#13;
tremely low by historical standards (World Bank Development Policy Staff&#13;
1977, pp. 124-27), but-probably still more important-tariffs agreed in nego-&#13;
tiations- under GAIT auspices were 'bound', as were the zero tariffs agreed&#13;
within the EEC.   Thus, the option of what had been historically the obvious&#13;

ism directed against develcping countries, see among others Tracy&#13;
Murray and Ingo Walter (1977, pp. 405-410), Balassa (1978, pp. 7-16),&#13;
and Sampson (1978, pp. 19-23). A thorough discussion of the whole&#13;
issue of non-tariff barriers is contained in Baldwin (1970), and the&#13;
most comprehensive recent treatment of the problem facing developing&#13;
countries is contained in Yeats (1978, Chapter 5).&#13;

means of industrial promotion for a market economy virtually disappeared.-2/&#13;
Thus, we find not only an increase in the extent of intervention, but a&#13;
change in its form.13/&#13;
As Franko points out (1978, p. 10), "It was partly because France&#13;
and Japan were arguably the two most successful economies in the advanced, non-&#13;
communist world during the early post-war years that the notion of adopting&#13;
"industrial policies" began to spread to Britain, Belgium and the European&#13;
Economic Commission in the late 1960's." Italy also seems to have been an&#13;
important example. In itself, the idea of active industrial policy need not&#13;
conflict at all with that of adjusting to such market forces as changes in&#13;
comparative advantage vis a vis developing countries. This is obvious when&#13;
industrial policy is truly forward looking, and allows a country to move with&#13;
confidence out of existing lines of activity (Hirono 1978, p. 23).&#13;
In practice, however, the very existence of large public intervention&#13;
funds has proved a source of strong pressure for propping up weak firms&#13;
and industries. Prior to 1974 this tendency was already&#13;
L2/ It should not be assumed that the earlier use of tariff protection in&#13;
industrialized countries was an efficient means cf infant industry&#13;
protection. Nor was this the only reason for such protection. See&#13;
on this Little, Scitovsky and Scott (1970, pp. 162-8).&#13;
3~/ It must be remembered that in the case of European countries the switch&#13;
towards non-trade policy instruments such as subsidies was dictated in&#13;
part by the fact that trade policy became the responsibility of the ERC&#13;
itself. The German example of such a shift is considered by Fels (1976,&#13;
p. 92) who states "During the 196os, a shift occurred in West Germany's&#13;
industrial assistance policy from assistance by trade barriers to&#13;
domestic subsidies and tax allowances". Little, Scitovsky and Scott&#13;
(1970, p. 164) state that the same thing happened in late l9th century&#13;
Japan, which was compelled to follow a policy of free trade.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
extremely obvious in the United Kingdom (Denton, 1976).1-/ Thus, the in-&#13;
creased role of the government in industry and the instruments being used,&#13;
although emerging in a buoyant context and generally forward looking in im-&#13;
pulse, could easily be used for vigorous defensive action in a subsequent&#13;
period of recession or rapid changes in comparative advantage.i2/&#13;
Another important development was an apparent deterioration in the&#13;
operation of the labour market. A visible sign was the rise in the rate off&#13;
unemployment   corresponding     to any given pressure of demand, as measured&#13;
by the vacancy rate. Thus, taking peaks of successive cycles we find the&#13;
unemployment rate in France at 1.1 percent (1964), 1.6 percent (1969) and&#13;
2 percent (1973),- in the United Kingdom at 1.4 percent (1964) and 2.3 percent&#13;
(1973), in the Netherlands at 0.8 percent (1965), 1.4 percent (1969) and&#13;
2.4 percent-(1973), and in the U.S.A. at 3.6-percent (1966) and 4.7 percent&#13;
(1973)(OECD 1978, Table 1).  The relation between vacancies and unemploymenit&#13;
seems to have changed markedly for the worse in Canada, Norway, Australia,&#13;
the Netherlands,- the United Kingdom, and Germany (Ibid., Diagram 4). A mone-&#13;
tarist might argue that-there has been a rise in the "natural" rate of&#13;
)34j  Assistance was also given, somewhat more successfully, to computers and&#13;
aluminium smelting (see Denton, 1976, Pp. 139-50). Denton concludes&#13;
that, notwithstanding its attractive objectives, "Industrial policy in&#13;
the United Kingdom since 1960 can only be characterized as incoherent."&#13;
(Ibid p. 150).  Ar. interesting example was the Industrial Expansion Act&#13;
of 1968, which, despite its forward-looking emphasis, was used inter -&#13;
alia to make loans and credit guarantees of up to £100 million for the&#13;
Concord and £24 million-for construction of the Queen Elizabeth II&#13;
(Ibid p. 133-4).&#13;
X/   Industrial policy can quickly become protectionist because it is clcsely&#13;
associated with the idea of obtaining a specific industrial structure.&#13;
From this it is a short step to the notion of "structure preferences",&#13;
which is the underpinning of some recent views on the international&#13;
division of labour and the need to maintain an unspecialized production&#13;
structure. See on this Henry et alii (1978, pp.. 4-6) and Balassa (1978,&#13;
p. 20, footnote 2), who quotes M. Barre.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
unemployment. Scott (1979) argues,at least for the case of the United&#13;
Kingdom,-that there has been an increase in structural unemployment - a&#13;
misnatch between the available labour force and the productive structure,&#13;
which, in turn, reflects a strong tendency towards labour-saving invest-&#13;
ment. This bias is explained, according to Scott, by the extremely rapid&#13;
fall in the share of profits in value added after 1966. (Ibid., Table 5.3,&#13;
and OECD March 1979, Diagram 7), a phenomenon that seems also to have oc-&#13;
curred elsewhere (McCracken et al. (1977), p. 161).&#13;
Declining rates and shares of profit are of importance not only&#13;
for the effect on the characteristics of investment, but also on its level.&#13;
The latter, in turn, affects the ability to adjust, since moving capital&#13;
from one industry to another obviously requires fresh investment and, conse-&#13;
quently, the lower the rate of investment in new productive assets, the more&#13;
difficult will be the process of adjustment. Glisman, Rodemer and Wolter&#13;
(July 1978, Table Al) show that in West Germany(in 1962 prices) the share&#13;
of net investment in net social product has fallen markedly ever since 1970,&#13;
from 20.1 percent to 16.6 percent in 1973 and 12.9 percent in 1977. Of in-&#13;
terest for the view that some of the seeds of subsequent problems were sown&#13;
in the middle of the great boom, the same authors argue (June 1978, p. 24)&#13;
that Germany is in the downswing of-a long growth cycle, whose high point&#13;
was 1960.&#13;
There were other indications of structural rigidity. One was the&#13;
rapid spread of the idea of regional policy. In the United Kingdom regional&#13;
policies have existed since the 1930s because of the continuing problem of&#13;
the areas with a high concentration of the older export industries. In the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
post Second World War period regional policy has been a particularly&#13;
important part of United Kingdom industrial policy (Denton 1976, pp. 134-9).&#13;
In France regional policy emerged in the early 1960s (Schonfield 1965, p. 356,&#13;
note 69); in Germany it was originated'in 1950, to develop the border areas&#13;
with the Eastern Zone, but was greatly extended in 1959 (Schonf'ield 1965,&#13;
p. 263, note 57); in Italy the main objective since the 1950s has been de-&#13;
velopment of the Mezzogiorno (Schonfield'1965, p. 183); and the idea is now&#13;
firmly entrenched throughout Europe, even in the smallest countries. Recently,&#13;
Japan has begun-its own version (Economist November 18, 1978, p. 124).    The'&#13;
EEC established its own collective Regional Development Fund in 1975 (Commis-&#13;
sion of the European Communities 1975), which spent 850 million European&#13;
units of account by January 1977 (Ibid. 1977, p. 14). However,'already in&#13;
the late 1960s the Commission felt obliged to intervene to reduce the subsi-&#13;
dies given by the wealthier countries of the EEC, and thus to mitigate the&#13;
possible harmful effects of a wasteful policy competition. Obviously, re-&#13;
gional pclicies need not be injurious either to the countries using them or&#13;
to the export-interests' of the developing countries. Ilowever, the strongly&#13;
felt desire for such policies is likely to reflect labour market r gidity in&#13;
part,because explicit subsidization is required whenever labour is unwilling&#13;
tc move, differences in the inter-regional demand for labour are not reflected&#13;
in wage level differences, and full employment of all labour is desired.&#13;
Furthermore, the willingness of government to provide such subsidies is per-&#13;
haps a factor in confirming those very rigidities.&#13;
Perhaps the problem most completely identified with the 1970s is&#13;
that of inflation, but rising'inflation had already emerged in many countries&#13;
in the later 1960s. If one compares annual inflation rates for a number of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
major countries for 1966 to 1977 with their average inflation rates for&#13;
1961-70, one observes that for the U.S.A., France and the U.K. that&#13;
average has been exceeded in every year subsequent to and including 1968; L&#13;
for Germany and Italy the same is true subsequent to and including 1970; and&#13;
for Japan it is true for all but one year since 1970. Thus, in all these&#13;
major countries inflation has been consistently worse in the 19708 than in&#13;
the 1960s, and in certain cases the turning point was as early as 1968.&#13;
(See Table 1.)&#13;
Another feature which is relevant to our topic is the decline in&#13;
manufacturing employment as a share of total employment. As OECD (1979,&#13;
pp. 19-21) states, "it is ...significant that between 1960 and 1973 (i.e.,&#13;
prior to the recession), the share of industry in employment peaked in most&#13;
OECD countries and in many of them the absolute level of industrial employ-&#13;
ment started to decline." Indeed, it turns out that in 1970 the level of&#13;
industrial employment was the same as or lower than that in 1963 in the&#13;
United Kingdom, Switzerlarnd, Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands (a 2.4 per-&#13;
cent increase), Sweden, Austria, and Italy (Ibid., Chart D). It is on the&#13;
manufacturing sector that imports from developing countries bear most heavily;&#13;
furthermore, import-competing manufacturing as whole is usually quite highly&#13;
unionized (Frank 1977, pp. 16-17). -It is not surprising that workers in a&#13;
sector where employment is essentially stagnant or even declining are&#13;
particularly defensive and prone to support almost any job-preserving measures.&#13;
16 In the case of the U.S.A. the inflation rate first exceeded the 1961-7C&#13;
average in 1967, but only by 0.1 percent.&#13;

Finally, by the early l960s problems were beginning to emerge&#13;
in the area which had seen the greatest success, namely, trade. Overall,&#13;
libaralization was impressive. However, certain failures were becoming&#13;
increasingly apparent: in the first place, agricultural trade has remained&#13;
stubbornly unliberalized (Curzon (1965), pp. 166-208) and indeed the Common&#13;
Agricultural Policy of the EEC was a new and virtually insuperable barrier&#13;
to the international division of labor in agriculture. In the second place,&#13;
the increased intervention of government in the domestic economies of devel-&#13;
oped countries has itself created serious problems for the system of inter-&#13;
national rules that regulate trade. The result has been increased atten-&#13;
tion to the problem of nontariff intervention, but without any great success&#13;
in defining what is, and is not, acceptable behavior.iv    Finally, an estab-&#13;
lished structure of discrimination against developing countries (and Japan)&#13;
was created and extended during the 1960s. Of particular importance was the&#13;
Long Term Agreement on cotton textiles of 1962, "in which the generally and&#13;
solemnly agreed rules of pout-war policy conduct - including the keystone of&#13;
the system, the non-discrimination rule - were formally set aside for reasons&#13;
recognized as pragmatic" (Blackhurst, Marian and lumlir 1977, p. 55).   This&#13;
agreement provided another precedent of relevance to our subject, namely, that&#13;
whereby "temporary" restrictions designed to help adjustment have turned into&#13;
permanent and growing protectionism. The LTA "was introduced with the&#13;
IV Malmgren (1977, pp. 219-33) is worth quoting in extenso: "Domestic&#13;
microeconomic policies aimed at sectoral, regional, or institutional&#13;
problems also give rise to significant trade-distorting effects. These&#13;
structural policies are becoming increasingly important....As Govern-&#13;
ment responsibility has broadened structural objectives have multiplied&#13;
- to the point, in recent years, that structural policies often conflict&#13;
with, or undercut, international rules as well as the arrangements which&#13;
have emerged from multilateral bargaining." (Ibid, pp. 219-20).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
ceclared purpose of assisting importing countries to adjust to changes in&#13;
the pattern of world trade in cotton textiles."   (Tripartite Report July&#13;
1973, p. 8.) However, sixteen years later the recent Multi-Fibre Arrangement&#13;
vas the most restrictive and comprehensive of all these agreements. Apart&#13;
frem the introduction of discriminatory quotas for textiles within the GATT,&#13;
the 1960s saw the first use of bilateral measures outside the GATT to con-=&#13;
trol the exports of developing countries. The most important of these were&#13;
the so-called "Orderly Marketing Agreements" and "Voluntary Export Restraints".&#13;
Thus, what seemed to be happening was the use of domestic interventions, such&#13;
as subsidies, for industries competing with other developed countries (for&#13;
which trade policy measures were largely ruled out) and resort to discrimi-&#13;
natory trade restrictions, often entirely outside the GATT, to deal with the&#13;
exports of the developing countries and Japan.&#13;
Obviously, none of these problems was of overwhelming importance at&#13;
the time. Unemployment was kept at historically low levels throughout the&#13;
developed world; inflation, while rising, remained tolerable; the rate of&#13;
profit, while falling in some important cases, was not a barrier to an excep-&#13;
tionally high rate of investment; protectionist sentiment and actihn did not&#13;
prevent an extraordinarily rapid growth of world trade, in general, and of&#13;
manufactured exports from the developing countries, in particular; and indus-&#13;
trial policy intervention was as often positive as defensive in orientation&#13;
and did not lead to overwhelming problems in international commercial rela-&#13;
tions. Nonetheless, two points emerge: in the first place, the growth of&#13;
defensive microeconomic intervention, which followed the onset of recession,&#13;
follows from longer term trends in policy making. Secondly, specific discrimina-&#13;
tion against the exports of developing countries, while greatly increased in scope&#13;
and severitv in recent vears. is not the consequence of recession alone. On the&#13;
contrary, the tendency to-use measures that prevent the exploitation of the&#13;

by 1973.&#13;
B.  The Consequences of Recession&#13;
What was only a trickle in the late 196Cs and early 197Cs became&#13;
almost a flood after 1973. As the Oecretary-General of the OECD remarks&#13;
(OECD (June 1979), p. 73), "...since the oil crisis and the inflationary re-&#13;
cession of 1974-75, there is evidence of a shift in policies from longer-term&#13;
to short-term objectives, Yron, broadly-based to more selective interventions&#13;
and, more fundamentally, from the pursuit of adjustment to a defenlsive pCs-&#13;
ture based on maintaining the status quo. it was only to be expected that&#13;
this shift would first manifest itself in the area of trade pclicies, which&#13;
are particularly tempting for defensive and selective short-term action."&#13;
(My underlining.)&#13;
A key point is that for most developed countries (except the U.S.A.)&#13;
the unwillingness to employ Keynesian remedies for high unemployment was the&#13;
consequence of two considerations: the first (and less important) was a&#13;
concern about the balance of payments, which resulted from the large surplus&#13;
of the OPEC countries and the lack of any completely reliable means of recycl-&#13;
ing the surpluses (except - until recently - for the United States). Borrcw-&#13;
ing from commercial sources meant running the risk of suddenly running out of&#13;
credit just when (or because) it was most needed. The adjustment then re-&#13;
quired did not seem to be as simple as proponents of floating exchange rates&#13;
had believed. On the contrary, extremely wild swings in the excharge. rate&#13;
with harmful effects on inflation and general uncertainty seemed to be the&#13;
result of balance of payments disequilibria. Thus the combination of large&#13;
ex ante balance of payments deficits following from expansionary policy,&#13;
insecure access to capital, and a painful and costly adjustment precess all&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
inhibited expansion in countries facing a weak balance of payments situa-&#13;
tion (except - until recently - in the United States).&#13;
Cf greater importance, because still more general, was the fear&#13;
of a resurgence of inflation. The fear resulted in large measure frcm the&#13;
suspicion that inflationary expectations combined with the deterioration&#13;
of allocative mechanisms meant that bottlenecks were likely to emerge before&#13;
unemployment had been greatly reduced, and that these would lead to rapid&#13;
rises in prices. This was particularly likely because changes in relative&#13;
prices (especially of energy) meant that the marginal pattern of expendi-&#13;
ture was likely to diverge sharply from the average. If resources could not&#13;
move freely and easily into the new activities, bottlenecks were certain to&#13;
arise.   Indeed, both the inflexibility of labor and the depressed level of&#13;
investment made it rather unlikely that resources would flow in the desired&#13;
directions. Blackhurst, Marian and Tumlir (1978) argue that it is increased&#13;
uncertainty which constrains investment, and that this uncertainty results&#13;
from inflation and the nature of government invervention, especially in trade&#13;
policy (Ibid, pp. 85-6). What is certain is that the Keynesian notion of&#13;
aggregate demand is not particularly useful in a situation in which changes&#13;
in the pattern of demand make the existing inter-industrial allocation of&#13;
resources inappropriate.&#13;
Given this situation, unemployment is a policy choice (aimed at&#13;
curbing inflation). However, it is obviously a highly undesirable way of&#13;
achieving this aim. A logical policy might be to attempt to improve&#13;
the process of achieving balance of payments equilibrium; provide a more&#13;
reliable means of lending from surplus to deficit countries; reduce the in-&#13;
flationary bias in the wage bargaining process; improve the ease with which&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
resources flow from one sector or region to another; increase the profit-&#13;
ability of business; and reduce the policy-created uncertainties facing it.&#13;
In the context of such policies, and after a period of disinflation, further&#13;
expansion might be possible. In practice, most developments have been in the&#13;
opposite (and largely self-defeating) direction.&#13;
Much effort has gone into the attempt to preserve existing firms&#13;
and jobs. Indeed, it is this effort that deserves most fully the statement&#13;
that  public policy decisions  are largely a euphemism for incoherent sequences&#13;
of desperate expedients" (Lachmann, March 1976, p. 61). Of the major nations,&#13;
the U.S.A., Japan and Germany resisted substantial increase in industrial&#13;
subsidization but France, Italy and the United Kingdom did not.     The impor-&#13;
tance of this development lies not only in the probable waste of resources,&#13;
but still more in the concentration on the weaker firms, and thus the erosion&#13;
of the basic discipline of the market.&#13;
The turn to a largely defensive industrial policy was obvious in Britain&#13;
and Italy. In the former, the newly created National Enterprise Board&#13;
launched in 1975, sunk over 90 percent of its twice-expanded assets in Rolls&#13;
Royce and British Leyland (Price, September 1978, pp. 20-1). In Italy, the&#13;
state sector has steadily expanded to take over sick private firms, usually&#13;
without any subsequent rationalizatiQn, and the result is that 30 percent of&#13;
the industrial labor force is now employed by the state (Ibid., p. 26). In&#13;
France, assistance was also given to many declining industries (Balassa,&#13;
1978, p. 17).&#13;
While, in general, Germany, the U.S.A. and Japan resisted the&#13;
tendency towards defensive intervention on behalf of individual&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
industries,     Germany   , as part of the- EEC, has had to go along with&#13;
the creation of a steel cartel, which combines three elements, namely,&#13;
voluntary production quotas, compulsory minimum prices and import restric-&#13;
tions.  All the European gcvernments, other than in Germany, are subsidizing&#13;
their steel industries, and in several. cases (flelgium, France an'd Sweden,&#13;
for exa¢ple) there has been extensive-nationalization.   It is far from clear&#13;
that this will lead to any significant restructuring, since the EEC has pro-&#13;
vided the framework for profitability, but has no power to compel governments&#13;
to rationalize their industries (Price, 1978, pp. 53-4). Shipbuilding'is&#13;
also subsidized throughout Europe, even by Germany (Financial Times, 12th&#13;
December 1978).&#13;
Apart from subsidies to individual firms and industries, and the&#13;
creation.cf international cartels, two other important defensive measures&#13;
have spread rapidly. The first is direct subsidization of labour; the&#13;
second is protection. The Temporary Employment Subsidy was introduced in&#13;
the TK in August 1975 and is paid to employers, who are prepared to keep on&#13;
employees, whom they would otherwise make'redundant (Layard, 1978). The&#13;
scheme has covered about 200,000 workers, more tilan half of whom wtere located&#13;
in the textile, clothing and footwear sectors. In Germany, the Government&#13;
provides 75 to 90 percent of the difference between the full-time wage and&#13;
the wage earned -by workers who had to be-put on a part-time basis because&#13;

S/ However, Balassa (1978, pp. 18-19) notes that the USA plans various forms&#13;
of special assistance to the steel industry and has long subsidized ship-&#13;
building. In Japan a bill was introduced in February 1978 to authorize&#13;
assistance to the a]uminium, steel, shipbuilding and synthetic fibre&#13;
industries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
employment of older workers and of workers undergoing training is subsi-&#13;
dized. While some subsidization of employment can be justified in a reces-&#13;
sion, especially given the various ways that employment is taxed, it is&#13;
important to note that most of this intervention is designed to preserve&#13;
existing, rather than create long-term new,employment. Thus, in the UK a&#13;
program designed to subsidize new jobs (the Small Firms Employment Subsidy)&#13;
is less generous than the Temporary Employment Subsidy and covers vastly&#13;
fewer workers (Layard, 1978). In addition to such subsidization, there has&#13;
been almost universal action to make it more difficult to lay off workers,&#13;
by requiring employers to make redundancy payments cr other employment&#13;
security legislation (for example, the British Employment Protection Act of&#13;
1975).&#13;
Where firms are subject to competition from within a ccuntry or&#13;
from other developed ccuntries (or are export-oriented), the Government has&#13;
resort to direct subsidization or international cartelization. Where the&#13;
latter requires control over imports as well, the letter of the GATT can be&#13;
kept by having-resort to "anti-dumping" provisions, as has happened with&#13;
both the U.S.A.'s and EEC's "trigger-price" mechanism for steel (Balassa,&#13;
1978, pp. 10-11).   Towards developing countries protectionism has&#13;
been more blatant. Thus, they have been treated to an extremely restrictive&#13;
renegotiation of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement.9/ A host of other discriminatory&#13;
12/ Keesing (May 1978) provides a comprehensive account of the renegotia-&#13;
tions of the MFA and its implications. Of particular importance has&#13;
been the role of the UK and France within the EEC in pushing for tight&#13;
restrictions, which were then imposed on the negotiations as a whole.&#13;
While supposedly temporary, there is no adjustment program attached to&#13;
the Arrangement, and every likelihood of further restrictions in future.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 33 -&#13;
restrictions on exports of developing countries have been introduced,&#13;
focussed especially on the most successful countries (South Korea, Taiwan&#13;
and Hong Kong) and on a wide range of products.°-/   In themselves, these&#13;
measures, while extremely disadvantageous to developing countries, are not&#13;
crippling, provided the large area of trade among developed countries re-&#13;
mains unrestricted and developing countries can replace existing exporters.&#13;
However, as the GATT Secretariat notes (1978, p. 14 "from the categories&#13;
of textiles, clothing and footwear, in which the industrial countries are,&#13;
by and large, at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis the developing coun-&#13;
tires, protectionism is now spreading into industries in which they compete&#13;
mutually and, through chemicals, into the advanced technology industries&#13;
which embody the comparative advantage of industrial countries vis-a-vis&#13;
other economies. As a result of these and earlier developments, world trade&#13;
is burdened by-substantially more restrictions than it was five years ago.&#13;
In late 1977, the GATT estimated that 3 to 5 percent of world trade was "being&#13;
adversely affected by import restrictions introduced, or seriously threatened,&#13;
by.the industrially advanced countries. 1     OECD-sponsored "standstill"&#13;
agreements have had little effect (Sampson, 1978, p. 30). This is consistent&#13;
with inter-war experience. Hudec (1975, p. 4) remarks that, in spite of pro-&#13;
nouncement of the best liberal principles, "the main value of their exhorta-&#13;
tions seems to have been to provide an official record of:their progressive&#13;
decline."&#13;

In evaluating the effects of these defensive measures, our concern is&#13;
with their relation to the broad and important aim of lowering overall unemployment.&#13;
If governments are maintaining unemployment in order to curb the size of wage&#13;
claims, defensive measures to maintain employment in particular industries&#13;
can only lower aggregate output. The government will raise unemployment&#13;
elsewhere to offset the employment preserved, and it can be presumed that,&#13;
where employment is lost, the value of output is close to the wage, while in&#13;
the subsidized industries the gain in output is less than the wage. If&#13;
governments are merely unwilling to see aggregate demand expand because of&#13;
fears of inflation, the effect of the measures on employment deperds on how&#13;
far productivity is lowered and on the ability to shift unemployment to&#13;
foreigners. Thesei"beggar-my-neighbour" policies are explicitly supported&#13;
by Layard (1978), who states: "The fact that textiles and clothing are so&#13;
*nternationelly competitive affords some hope (sic) that a reasonable frac-&#13;
tion of the subsidized workers displaced foreign rather than domestic output&#13;
and employment." It is possible that governments are unwilling to expand,&#13;
because of fears of the early emergence of inflationary bottlenecks. In that&#13;
case, measures designed to keep workers in their existing low-productivity&#13;
employment rather than encourage transfer to sectors likely to face rapid&#13;
growth in demand can only raise the level of unemployment in the long run.&#13;
This is particularly important if, along with unskilled workers with few&#13;
alternatives, defensive measures keep highly skilled workers locked up in&#13;
such sectors as steel, automobiles, and ship-building. The trade-off be-&#13;
tween unemployment and inflation is then worsened in both the short and long&#13;
run. A final possibility is that governments do not wish to expand until&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 35 -&#13;
they have succeeded in giving firms greater confidence in the long-term&#13;
stability of the environment, and thus increased their willingness to in-&#13;
vest. In that; case a host of ad hoc measures designed to maintain existing&#13;
firms, even at the price of increasing public expenditure on subsidies, is&#13;
likely to worsen rather than improve the situation, as business becomes in-&#13;
creasingly unsure about the long tern environment, especially if businessmen&#13;
believe that such measures will add to inflation. In sum, these defensive&#13;
policies will only improve aggregate employment if, for some reason, govern-&#13;
ment is completely unable to raise aggregate demand, and the subsidies lead&#13;
tc the export of unemploynient on "beggar-my-neighbour" lines. -/   "   However, if&#13;
policies to raise aggregate demand are constrained by fears of inflation,&#13;
whether due to the wage-bargaining process,-the expected emergence of bottle-&#13;
necks or worries about business confidence and the lack of private investment,&#13;
defensive policies to maintain employment are likely to increase unemployment&#13;
in ar.ything longer than the very short run, or.,-given unemployment, to lower&#13;
output.&#13;
22/  Magee (1972, p. 651) points to the inferiority of beggar-my-neighbour&#13;
policy for lowering unemployment and cites the disastrous effects of&#13;
the LIoot-Saw'Ley Tariff Act of 1930. Of' course, it goes without saying&#13;
that all trade restrictions have an effect on employment through the&#13;
export of unemployment. Thus, our discussion of defensive wage or&#13;
industry subsidization a fortiori includes the effects of trade restric-&#13;
tions.&#13;
23/ -One point should be rioted here, which relates closely to the long run&#13;
argument for wage subsidization. Assuming away the cycle, unemployment&#13;
may exist because of the elevated real cost to employers of unskilled&#13;
labour. Under the Stolper-Samuelson theorem, protection of the pro-&#13;
ducers of unskilled-labour-intensive import-substitutes will be a (third&#13;
best) way of raising equilibrium employment. Thus the arguments against&#13;
protection-and defensive wage subsidization as a means of lowering unem-&#13;
ployment are valid only in the context of a cyclical disequilibrium or&#13;
Keynesian underemployment equilibrium.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
All these actions seem to follow quite naturally from trends in&#13;
government intervention and market rigidity that were clearly visible before&#13;
1973. It is not necessary to take the cynical view that elected governments&#13;
prefer to be seen to be directly responsible for saving Jobs or creating&#13;
them (as in the United States' job programmes) to taking credit for the work-&#13;
ings of an impersonal market. Of course, there is some plausibility to the&#13;
view that governments can expect some electoral return for making so many&#13;
jobs directly dependent on the continuation of their largesse. However, it&#13;
is just as plausible that, in a context of general unemployment, it is simply&#13;
not feasible for elected governments, who have taken responsibility for the&#13;
course of economic events and bear the blame for failure, to allow the market&#13;
to work.&#13;
It is important not to exaggerate the seriousness, of the current&#13;
situation. It should be remembered that between 1929 and 1933 international&#13;
trade declined from $65 billion to $25 billion a year (Magee 1972, p. 651),&#13;
while between 1974 and 1977 the volume of world exports rose by 12.5 percent,&#13;
and that of world output by 10.6 percent (GATT, 1978, Table 1). Furthermore,&#13;
the realization that defensive policies will prove self-defeating seems to&#13;
have spread. The French Government, for exanple, committed itself to a&#13;
notable change in policy after the March 1978 elections. Thus Price (1978,&#13;
p. 5) quotes Raymond Barre as saying:"We must not hesitate to cut out the&#13;
dead wood, that is, the sectors where we cannot compete. The future of&#13;
France does not depend on the number of ships which we build at a loss, nor&#13;
on the production of steel which we cannot sell." Furthermore, the Govern-&#13;
ment finally let the Boussac textile empire collapse, as well as Terrin,&#13;
France's largest ship-repairer, and has attempted major changes in the steel&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
industry   The French rescue organization, the   Comite Interministerial&#13;
pour l'Amenagement des Structures Industrielles   (CIASI) has had consid-&#13;
erable success in saving firmps at fairly modest expense (Ibid., pp. 3-4).&#13;
Similar realism seems to be emerging - if-painfully - in the United Kingdom&#13;
and the Netherlands (Ibid., pp. 24 and 32). Finally,, it must be'considered&#13;
encouraging that the Tokyo Round seems likely to come to a successful conclu-&#13;
sion. The Hoot-Smawley Tariff Act raised tariffs on one thousand articles of&#13;
trade!&#13;
C. Conflicting Ideologies&#13;
The account of the problems of the industrialized countries that&#13;
has been given above follows from a particular view (or ideology perhaps) of&#13;
the economic process. There are others, and they each imply not only a dif-.&#13;
ferent analysis of the-past but different recommendations for the future; not&#13;
only different assessments of the overall problem of the developed countrics&#13;
but contrasting judgements on whether (and how) to adjust to imports from&#13;
developing countries. These different approaches are of importance and will&#13;
recur in various guises in subsequent discussion of the problems created by&#13;
imports from developing countries.   They not only provide alternatfive modes of.&#13;
analysis but are actually part of the current scene, influencing the actions&#13;
of those in power and the pressure of those whc are not.&#13;
a. The Emergence of Protectionism&#13;
Very little of the policy of the industrialized countries thus far&#13;
has followed from explicit acceptance of protectionist ideas. On'the contrary,&#13;
with the possible exception of the French Prime Minister's famous plea for&#13;
"oorganized free trade", public adherence to the principles of liberal trade&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
has remained strong. Actual protectionist and defensive actions have had&#13;
the characteristics of a series of desperate expedients rather than of any&#13;
long-term policy. Behind the scenes, however, explicit political and intel-&#13;
lectual support for the protectionist idea has grown. In the United Kingdom,&#13;
for example, the Cambridge Economic Policy Grcup has come forward with a rela-&#13;
tively sophisticated protectionism based on the view that countries like the&#13;
United Kingdom are facing a structural balance of payments constraint, which&#13;
cannot be dealt with by exchange rate adjustment but requires import restric-&#13;
tions if slow growth and !'de-industrialization" are to be prevented.L-' An&#13;
exp'.icitly mercantilist position has been advanced by Mr. Edmund Dell, the&#13;
former United Kingdom Secretary of State for Trade. He argues (February 1977, p.15)&#13;
that   "international trade is a kind of war in which it is better to win&#13;
than to lose ..... You win by having a surplus and you lose by having a deficit".&#13;
Of the developing countries' competition, he states that " 'unfair' competition&#13;
usually means competition which for whatever reason is of a kind that domestic&#13;
production in one or other developed country cannot meet" (October 1977, p. 7).&#13;
Most interestingly,he takes developing countries' mercantilism (which he be-&#13;
lieves to be in their interest) as adequate justification for reciprocal mer-&#13;
cantilism by the developed: "we have our own new international economic order&#13;
to promote...which gives us a greater feeling of security" (Ibid., p. 23.&#13;
24/ The Cambridge argument is contained in their annual Economic Policy&#13;
Reviews.&#13;
./ A discussion of Mr. Dell's views, from which I have taken these quota-&#13;
tions, is contained in Lal (19078).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39 -&#13;
Another current idea of protectionist import is that of "structure pref-&#13;
erences", which are to be set against the idea of comparative advantage,&#13;
according to the discussion by Professor de Bandt in an annex to a recent&#13;
expert report for the Commission of the European Communities. 6    Structural&#13;
preferences as a sort of "merit good" can clearly justify almost any form&#13;
of protectionist or defensive policy. Yet-others express doubt about whether&#13;
lberal access for the exports of developing countries is in their own in-&#13;
terests, since it increases their "dependency". i&#13;
These various ideas influence the-propaganda and policies of those&#13;
close to power. Trade union movements have become strongly protectionist in&#13;
several major countries (the United States of America and the United Kingdom,&#13;
for example). Industrialists too have ready resort to these various arguments,&#13;
and both they and the leaders of trade- unions enjoy pointing out that these&#13;
low cost imports are the products of "exploited" labor with the benefits sup-&#13;
posedly going to the "multinationals". Governments themselves reveal two&#13;
sources of protectionist action. To a large extent they are concerned with a&#13;
political problem, namely, that whether convinced of the need for adjustment&#13;
or r.ot they face the reality that in the short run they lose more politically&#13;
than they gain from permitting change. However, it is also true that, what-&#13;
ever the lip service to the ideal of liberal trade, protectionist ideas have&#13;
made some headway. There is the belief that 'an industry in the hand is worth&#13;
two in the bush', which reveals a fundamental doubt about the market's ability&#13;
26/ Annex 1 to Henry et al. (1978).&#13;
27/ See, for example, Ewers (1975, p. 178).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
to achieve adjustment, also represented by the fear that 'there is nothing&#13;
to adjust towards'.  Some governments seem to believe that they are sur-&#13;
rounded by neomereantilist sharks. On this view the willingness of a Japan&#13;
or a West Germany to run large current account surpluses is seen as the&#13;
counterpart of "de-industrialization" and ultimate total dependence on im-&#13;
ported manufactures.&#13;
The ideas of protectionism are obviously of importance. Eowever,&#13;
they will not be dealt with directly, but treated rather as a fact about the&#13;
environment.  It would take us too far afield to indicate why these-various&#13;
ideas seem to us false and misleading, although it is possible at least to&#13;
show that the costs of adjustment to trade with developing countries are&#13;
small. Our staiting point is the assumption that there is no thorough-going&#13;
commitment to protectionism in any of the key countries, largely because no&#13;
adjustment policies can deal with such a conviction, and indeed adjustment&#13;
policies are unlikely to be tried at all in these circumstances. The case&#13;
with which we are    concerned is one in which there is some desire to adjust&#13;
but doubt about the costs and political acceptability.&#13;
b. Alternative Approaches Among Pr onents of AdJiutmeit&#13;
b.i. Market-oriented analysis&#13;
Many of those who believe that the (more or less) free market is&#13;
the only guarantee of efficiency and international comity would agree with&#13;
our discussion of the long-standing symptoms of arteriosclerosis in the&#13;
industrialized countries and of the essentially short-sighted and harmful&#13;
nature of the response to the recession, and subsequent slow grow-th and high&#13;
unemployment of the years after 1974. What are thought to be the underlying&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
causes?  The answer of many is to emphasize the problemjs created by the&#13;
growth of goverrment interventions and of the welfare state. They point to&#13;
the desire to provide jobs in particular places, to be at the forefront of&#13;
particular industries, indeed, "to make possible progress without change"&#13;
(Tumlir (1978) p. 7), which has led to increasing government intervention.&#13;
This, in turn, is seen as the main cause of the declining efficiency of the&#13;
allocative system of the market (Blackhurst, Mlarian and Tumlir (1978) rp. 71).&#13;
In international affairs, as Golt notes (1978, p. 9),"We must now regard the&#13;
tendency of governments to intervene directly in the organization and direc-&#13;
tion of industry 'as a factor of great importance... in the rising tide of eco-&#13;
nomic nationalism and protectionism."   Other writers emphasize the problems&#13;
for economic efficiency and competitiveness created by the rapidly burgeoning&#13;
welfare states of certain countries (Geiger 1978 on Western Europe), and the&#13;
enormous share of national resources pre-empted for non-market expenditures&#13;
(Bacon and Eltis 1978). The common theme of these writers is that the root&#13;
cause of current problems, both in domestic and international economic poli-&#13;
cies, is excessive government interventionism of various kinds, and the sclu-&#13;
tion is to reduce it.   Their adjustment policies generally consist of a return&#13;
to a more freely-functioning market.&#13;
Another approach (but one that is closely related) is to emphasize&#13;
the government's valuable role in improving the functioning of the markets,&#13;
although continuing to rely on the latter as the main means of bringing about&#13;
change-(OECD June 1979, p. 82). Those who hold this view, and it is particu-&#13;
larly obvious in documents of the OFCD such as The Case for Positive Adjustment&#13;
Policies (June 1979), and Deepak Lal's monograph for the OECD, Unemployment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 42 -&#13;
and Wage Inflation in Industrial Economies (1977), would tend to agree&#13;
with much of the analysis cf symptoms presented above. However, their&#13;
view of the underlying causes would not be the same as those more confident&#13;
in the unguided market. Thus, the inflationary recession of the mid-1970s&#13;
would be seen as the consequence in large measure of fortuitous events in&#13;
the early 1970s,such as "the synchronous boom, inflation and the oil crisis"&#13;
(OECD June 1979, p. 71). Previously existing adjustment problems, which had&#13;
been masked by the long boom, were the consequence of forces outside the con-&#13;
trol, or the responsibility, of governments, whose own industrial policies were&#13;
"essentially growth and efficiency oriented" (Ibid., p.72).   It is only in the&#13;
years after the recession that government policy has moved decisively in a&#13;
defensive and short-sighted direction (Ibid., p.73). Thus, the papers published&#13;
by the OECD emphasize the importance not of less government intervention but of&#13;
a changed emphasis towards "positive adjustment policies", which implies a wide&#13;
range of interventions by government to-make the market more efficient and more just.&#13;
b.ii. Market-replacing analysis&#13;
Even among those who desire greater adjustment, especially to trade,&#13;
a common view is that the present failure-of the industrialized countries to&#13;
grow and to achieve full employment is the consequence of ineradicable flaws&#13;
in the market system itself :what the Marxists hail as a "crisis of capitalism".&#13;
Much more moderately, Mukherjee (1978, p. 75) remarks that "A good deal of state&#13;
involvement at the micro level has (as many bodies, including the OECD, have&#13;
pointed out) come about because there has been a need for remedial action to&#13;
counteract damage either caused directly by the operation of market forces or&#13;
which the market system is neither equipped nor prepared to meet." From this&#13;
has emerged a host of detailed interventions in the process of industrial&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 43 -&#13;
change. In many countries this has meant attempts to prepare plans at&#13;
thc sectoral level, usually after consultation with the industrialists and&#13;
unions involved (Ibid., p. 76).   From the point of view of Mukherjee and&#13;
UrICTAL (April 1978), this is an entirely ajTropriate response to the problems&#13;
ot the industrialized countrieL.   W'here such authors differ from'those who&#13;
want to use the same approach to irnpcse essentially protectionist "structural&#13;
preferences" is in their insistence that trade with developing countries must&#13;
be incorporated into this process of sectoral planning. As Mukherjee remarks,&#13;
"the call for a new international economic order is a proposal for deliberate,&#13;
determined and, most of all, anticipatory adaptation of production structures&#13;
by the dcs" (ITbid., pp. 77-8). It would not be incorrect tc say that in much&#13;
of their analysis of the political and economic problems of the developed countries,&#13;
those who propose the planned imposition of a productive structure favourable to&#13;
the developing countries are identical to the protectionists. The difference&#13;
is that the recommended policy method is to be turned on its head to achieve&#13;
"structure prefernces" in accordance with the desires of the developing&#13;
countries.&#13;
D. Conclusion&#13;
The current situation of the industrialized countries has three cen-&#13;
tral implications for the process of adjustment to imports from developing&#13;
coumtries. In the first place, to the extent that it reflects a long-standing&#13;
and increasing inflexibility, one of the sym.ptoms has been an equally long-&#13;
standing bias against imports from the developing countries. In the second&#13;
place, the recessicn is bcth cause and perhaps product of still greater unwill-&#13;
ingness and inability to adjust, which, in turn, still further limits the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
44 -&#13;
acceptability of greatly increased imports from developing countries,&#13;
however small their true impact. Finally, the continued slow growth and&#13;
high unemployment is leading not merely to decreased willingness to resist&#13;
the protectionist pressures of those affected by imports, but actually to&#13;
increased general acceptance of protectionist ideas and the erosion of the&#13;
commitment to a liberal order, both internationally and dcmestically.&#13;
In what follows we focus on the policies that might improve the&#13;
adjustment process, on the assumption that such adjustment is desired. As&#13;
will become apparent, some policies can be directed specifically to the bias&#13;
against trade, while others must have a more general effect (if they work at&#13;
all). Thus, while there will be no further analysis of the overall situetion&#13;
of the developed countries, the policies to 'be discussed should certainly dc&#13;
no harm and indeed should be beneficial in this wider context.&#13;
What is thought to be the underlying problem of the developed coun-&#13;
tries and the appropriate remedies differs fundamentally even among those who&#13;
favour the idea of the acceptance of change, in general, and of imports, in&#13;
particular. These differences of opinion will reappear at various points&#13;
throughout the analysis. While it will be clear from the discussion above in&#13;
which directions the author leans, the attempt will be made to propose and&#13;
discuss policy options on the basis of the alternative judgements of what the&#13;
problems really are. Nonetheless, some view will ultimately have to be taken&#13;
of which approaches could conceivably work and why.&#13;

III.        THE ADJUSTMENT PROBLEM AND THE GOALS OF ADJUSTMENT POLICY&#13;
A.    Introduction&#13;
What are the social and private-costs of economic change? What is&#13;
the cost of adjustment itself? Is there anything special about trade, in general,&#13;
or trade with developing countries, in particular? Is the problem of adjustment&#13;
to trade-economic or political, and what is the relationship between the two?&#13;
What do we know about the characteristics of those affected by trade-induced&#13;
competition? Can we quantify the costs it imposes? These are the questions con-&#13;
sidered in this chapi.er.&#13;
B. The Theory of Adjustment&#13;
a. The Social Costs&#13;
The analysis of the costs, both-social and private, created by any&#13;
economic change is complex and depends in large part on what is assumed about the&#13;
workings of the economy. If we ignore the distribution of income, an optimum is&#13;
reached when marginal rates of transformation through trade are equated-to those&#13;
in domestic production. If the initiating change is an improvement in the terms&#13;
of trade, social costs will arise only to the extent that there exist imperfections&#13;
in the economy. If the initiating change is liberalization of imports, social&#13;
costs may also arise as a result of a deterioration of the terms of trade needed&#13;
to equilibrate the balance of payments.&#13;
-Obviously, the most important factor is the extent and nature of&#13;
domestic market imperfections. If wages are inflexible or do not reflect the&#13;
opportunity cost of labor, long term and costly unemployment can ensue (Mutti 1978).,&#13;
This effect may be multiplied as demand falls,both for the import substitute -&#13;
directly, and indirectly for supplieb of inputs or of goods previously purchased&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
by owners of factors of production employed in the import-substituting industry.&#13;
Even if unemployment is not permanent, there may be a period during which labor&#13;
searches for jobs and owners of capital search for the best alternative use for&#13;
their assets. The costs of search and of the output lost during the period of search&#13;
are social costs. However, depending on the precise nature of the labor market or&#13;
of the market in used capital equipment, these costs may subsequently be offset. Thus,&#13;
if the wage in the declining industry were determined by that which the marginal&#13;
worker could expect in alternative employment, minus the costs of search, then his&#13;
current wage will be below his expected wage. Consequently, the real costs of search&#13;
and of output forgone during search will be made up by higher wages (and product) in&#13;
new employment, provided the worker's cxpectations were correct. Thus, without&#13;
entering into all the ramifications, it is true in general that change has&#13;
social costs, to the extent that the current prices of factors of&#13;
production do not reflect opportunity costs and to the extent that they are&#13;
inflexible. Such adjustment costs consist of the loss of valuable output and&#13;
the costs of search, and where appropriate these are to be added to losses caused&#13;
by deterioration, of the terms of trade.&#13;
In some empirical work on this subject, there has been a tendency&#13;
to assume that the social losses due to unemployment can be measured by the&#13;
change in employment in the import competing industry (computed from average&#13;
labor-output ratios), multiplied by the average period of unemployment and by&#13;
the average wage in the import-competing industry. For a number of reasons this&#13;
may be a misleading 7qay of making these calculations. In the first place, there&#13;
will be increased expenditures elsewhere by those who benefit from the change&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
(for example, foreign exporters or domestic consumers). 1/ These are likely&#13;
to reduce the queues for employment in other industries. Thus, it is not&#13;
correct to assume that all those who leave the affected industry would otherwise&#13;
have remained employed there. Normal turnover as well as capital deepening&#13;
need to be taken into account. In the third place, the value of the output of&#13;
the marginal worker in an industry that is contracting due to a terms of trade&#13;
improvement or import liberalization, is below the wage. In addition, leisure&#13;
itself may be seen as having some social value. Finally, wages and even returns&#13;
to other factors may be higher in the new industry than the old, thus compensating&#13;
for the loss of output and search costs during the period of unemployment.&#13;
Against these various reasons for believing that costs may be&#13;
exaggerated by such studies as those of Baldwin and Mutti (1972), Magee (1972) and&#13;
Mutti (1978), there are also reasons for believing that they may be underestimated. In&#13;
particular, the costs of search and multiplier effects tend to be ignored. How-&#13;
ever, it has to be remembered that the latter work both ways, through the&#13;
reduction in demand for import substitutes and through the expansion in demand&#13;
elsewhere.   On balance, concentrating only on the domestic consequences of&#13;
trade liberalization, it seems likely that the methods of computation that have&#13;
frequently been employed are likely to lead to a substantial exaggeration. Be&#13;
that as it may, from an analytical point of view the social costs that follow&#13;
from an improvement in the terms of trade or import liberalization may be divided&#13;
1/   Foreign exporters' income need not rise following a fall in the price of their&#13;
exports. However., if the change is removal of a previous tariff, a rise in export&#13;
earnings will occur, but this is not necessarily the case if the previous&#13;
restriction were a quota, that permitted the exporter to obtain the rent.&#13;

into terms of trade effects (which arise in the case of import liberalization)&#13;
and costs of transition, including the loss of valuable output during periods&#13;
of unemployment of factors and the costs of search. Against these there are&#13;
benefits to consumers and possible long term benefits from the more productive&#13;
use of factors. It is the costs of transition that make up the adjustment costs&#13;
strictly defined, and their existence and extent depend on such market imperfec-&#13;
tions as inflexible wages, factor prices that do not reflect opportunity costs&#13;
and imperfect information-about alternatives. 2/ 3/&#13;
In order to illuminate the subsequent discussion of the effects created&#13;
by the developing countries' exports, let us consider what will determine the&#13;
social costs. Any industry that employs industry- or location-specific factors,&#13;
especially in a region with few other opportunities, is likely to impose larger&#13;
costs by its contraction, ceteris paribus. Important considerations will be the extent&#13;
of employment of immobile workers, (for example, married women or those enjoying&#13;
2/    By and large, this discussion is consistent with that in Tumlir (1976).&#13;
The main disagreement seems to be with his argument that, since the transfer&#13;
of employment is necessary, the only social cost derives from the difference&#13;
between the period of unemployment of the import-affected worker and the&#13;
t'socially efficient" period of unemployment, valued at the wage in the new&#13;
employment. This seems incorrect. It is not necessary to transfer the&#13;
workers following a terms of trade improvement nor, in general, is the value&#13;
of their output in a protected (or unliberalized) industry zero, although&#13;
it will be less than the wage.&#13;
3/   We are unsure how large the overestimate is likely to be, since it depends&#13;
on labor market conditions for the wide range of industries which will&#13;
expand. In a boom period these more dynamic industries may already face&#13;
severe labor shortages, in which case the normal ways of estimating frictional&#13;
unemployment costs will be correct. In a recession, however, errors may be&#13;
quite large, since increased output in the expanding industries should have&#13;
some effect on unemployment.&#13;
&#13;

- 49 -&#13;
location-specific subsidized housing), or of older people who often find it&#13;
difficult to obtain any other employment. At the extreme, the social cost&#13;
of continuing to employ the workers is given only by the value of their leisure,&#13;
which could be well below the social value of their product, even if the&#13;
(inflexible) wage is well above it. Of course, this cost is offset if the newly-&#13;
expanded industries also employ industry - or location-specific factors, (as&#13;
would happen, for example, if the exporting countries spend their earnings on&#13;
Boeing aircraft at a time of slack business in sales of commercial aircraft).&#13;
What is the effect of a recession? Obviously, there will be an increase in the&#13;
average duration of unemployment, but does it increase the frictional unemploy-&#13;
ment cost of import liberalization or protection forgone?      This depends on the&#13;
relation between the lengthened period of unemployment of import-affected&#13;
workers and the induced shortening of the period of unemployment of workers&#13;
attached to other industries or occupatiQns. It is not obvious a priori how&#13;
this will go. Finally, let it be noted that there is a logical argument that&#13;
the social cost of increased unemployment is actually negative. This follows,&#13;
if the level of unemployment is determined by a target level of real wages and&#13;
a liberal trade policy improves efficiency and growth, and thus makes it possible&#13;
to employ more people at the desired real wage. While this argument is not,&#13;
in fact, concerned with adjustment costs, it points out that a consistent policy&#13;
of protection could quite readily lead to a continued level of unemployment, and,&#13;
therefore, of social costs from lost output, greater than that from liberalization.&#13;
Indeed, it seems quite possible that a protectionist policy will lower immediate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-50 -&#13;
unemployment and raise it consistently in the long run. 4/&#13;
b. The Private Costs&#13;
The social costs of the sorts of change with*which we are concerned&#13;
are probably small, but the transfers involved can be very large. To the extent&#13;
that income distribution is a political concern and enters legitimately into&#13;
the "social welfare function", these transfers themselves can be seen as creating&#13;
social costs (or benefits). What are these transfers? The owners of physical and human&#13;
capital in the import substituting industry experience large windfall losses,&#13;
as will those workers whose opportunities elsewhere are, for one reason or&#13;
another, not comparable to those in existing employment. These changes are,&#13;
of course, only transfers, since the reductions in asset values (including here&#13;
human capital or entrenched position) that follow from, price reductions are&#13;
fully offset by equivalent benefits to consumers. Formally, all asset holders&#13;
lose the difference between the present value of the earnings originally&#13;
expected in the initial use and the present value in the best alternative use,&#13;
plus the cost of getting from the former to the latter, less any transfers from&#13;
government or other source. The work of Magee (1972) indicates that transfers&#13;
created by protection are very large indeed in relation to the conventionally&#13;
measured social costs.&#13;
4/   This argument makes clear how important it is to define the two states&#13;
of the world correctly. The comparison may not be a marginal one at all,&#13;
but rather between a protectionist or a liberal world. The evaluation of&#13;
the unemployment implications of the former vis-a-vis the latter is&#13;
obviously impossible.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
There is an important qualification to -any assessment of the&#13;
significance of these transfers, namely, that they arise in the short run,&#13;
while factors are immobile, and only to the extent that the change is un-&#13;
foreseen. In the long run it is reasonable to assume that most factors of&#13;
production are in perfectly elastic supply with respect to any specific industry&#13;
(except sometimes for land) (Magee 1972, p.665). In that case, protection or&#13;
changes in the terms of trade in the long run affect only the size of the industry&#13;
but not returns to factors, other than through the effects on the overall&#13;
demand for factors of production. Moreover, it is the differences in the short-&#13;
rtn elasticities of supply between the various factors of production that will&#13;
determine the distribution of the short-run transfer costs. Perfectly mobile&#13;
factors will bear no costs. Perfectly immobile factors may see-their value&#13;
brought down to zero. Nonetheless, in the long run people die and machines&#13;
wear out. New machines and young people can go elsewhere, and no section of&#13;
the population (except perhaps for the owners of some land) need be any worse&#13;
off than if the change in question had not occurred. It is for this reason&#13;
that a desire to reduce windfall losses has led to agreements to liberalize&#13;
tariffs according to a fixed and lengthy timetable, or to provide "temporary"&#13;
safeguard protection to industries threatened by terms of trade improvements.&#13;
What is the position of the major factors of production? Labor has&#13;
the advantage that it is generally more mobile than already existing physical&#13;
capital. Furthermore, training designed to augment or replace its human capital&#13;
is normally subsidized. In addition to being a flexible factor, labor is also&#13;
the beneficiary of most public transfer programs, and the risks of destitution,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
or even of a substantial fall in real income during the period of unemployment&#13;
are small. However, there are some important caveats: in the first place,&#13;
workers may have been receiving high wages in their former employment, either&#13;
because of trade union power (for example, in steel and coal in many countries)&#13;
or because of the value of skills, some of which may have no worth outside&#13;
(for example, printers); in the second place, those who are immobile geographically&#13;
or are old face the prospect of long or even indefinite periods of unemployment,&#13;
and are likely to find their new wages, just as will the first group, lower&#13;
than before; in the third place, the income from a job is usually a much more&#13;
more important source of income to the worker than is income from any particular&#13;
physical asset to its owner; and finally, there will be non-pecuniary costs&#13;
to the worker, if he has to change a job, to which he is attached, or to leave&#13;
a place he considers home. The importance of these factors will influence the&#13;
unwillingness to accept reallocation.&#13;
Particularly sector-specific skills are likely to be those of the&#13;
manager, especially one with a predominantly technical background, and of the&#13;
trade union official in a single-industry union. An interesting case arises&#13;
when one also considers the ownership of physical assets. Usually, those who&#13;
depend on the ownership of physical -assets have diversified portfolios (or&#13;
own shares in diversified companies). However, this is generally not the case&#13;
for owners of small businesses. If they are also the managers, they face the&#13;
risk of a substantial private cost, and one which the state will not compensate&#13;
adequately. One might expect that the private costs of a decline in the price&#13;
of an industry's output will be particularly high when the sector is characterized&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
by a large number of small manager-proprietors, who have most of their physical&#13;
and human assets employed in their firms. (Farming is surely the best example&#13;
and here the lack of alternative use of much land adds to the problem).&#13;
c.  From Protectionism to Protection - The Political Aspects&#13;
The existence of private costs resulting from an economic change is&#13;
no guarantee either of the creation of a protectionist movement or of the&#13;
successful introduction of protection. Between the two, there must be the&#13;
creation of lobbying groups and their effectiveness, the latter, in turn, depend-&#13;
ing on the political system and the political climate. Let us consider these&#13;
steps, and what is likely to determine the success of the attempt to change the&#13;
rules of the economic game by political means.&#13;
As North (1978, p.970) remarks, "Neoclassical theory simply ignores&#13;
the losers. In a general equilibrium model they are costlessly reabsorbed into&#13;
the economic system. In fact, there are losers - both relative and absolute -&#13;
in a dynamic economic system and those participants attempt to avoid the costs&#13;
associated with being losers". Perhaps the most interesting general discussion&#13;
of the problem is contained in Hirschman (1970), who distinguishes between the&#13;
options of "exit" and "voice". As he states (Ibid., p. 16), "voice is just the&#13;
opposite of exit", and later in the same paragraph, "voice is political action par&#13;
excellence". But, as Hirschman notes (Ibid.), "The economist tends naturally to&#13;
think that his mechanism (namely exit) is far more efficient and is in fact the only&#13;
one to be taken seriously". The significance of "voice" in changing the most&#13;
fundamental rules of economic life must not be underestimated. North points out&#13;
(1978, p.971);"The breakdown of the Madisonian political structure was.... a&#13;
result of conflicting property groups.... attempting to protect themselves from&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
competition".&#13;
While Hirschman does not, in fact, discuss the problem, it is&#13;
probably true that no other economic change elicits resort to "voice" to the&#13;
same extent as the threat of competition from abroad. Protection is, and has&#13;
always been, the most common means of attempting to save the position of&#13;
5/&#13;
particular groups threatened by economic change.    What is the particular&#13;
attraction of protection of senescent industry?&#13;
The process of obtaining protection involves a number of stages:&#13;
first, some group must feel that a particular change is making them worse off&#13;
than they expect or wish; second, a lobby must try to prevent the costs being&#13;
borne by the directly affected groups; third, there must be political receptivity;&#13;
and, finally, given the strength of the lobbying pressure and the degree of&#13;
receptivity, there may be political action. What can be said at a general&#13;
level about the political stages, before we consider the particular case of trade&#13;
with developing countries?&#13;
5/   Technical change is the major source of adjustment pressure in the long run.&#13;
Frank (1977, Table 3-4) shows that the growth in productivity per employee&#13;
was six times as important as trade as a source of job loss in his sample&#13;
of import-competing industries. Wolter (1977, Table A6) found that the&#13;
ratio of job displacement due to productivity change to that due to import&#13;
growth for West German   manufacturing for 1962-75 was four to one.   A country&#13;
experiencing a rise of productivity per man at a mere 2 percent per annum&#13;
suffers a job loss ceteris paribus of 22 percent of the labor force per&#13;
decade. Yet no government (to our knowledge) in the developed world has an&#13;
official program to prevent technical progress, although trade unions do act&#13;
in that direction. (India's policy of reservation of production to the small&#13;
scale sector is one case of such internal protection-)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
The key points about the lobbying effort created by trade are the&#13;
following: the private costs are almost always concentrated on well-defined&#13;
groups of producers, while the benefits are diffused among a wide range of&#13;
consumers and unaware producers; in certain cases lobbying organizations exist&#13;
ready-made, such as trade associations, giant corporations, or trade unions,&#13;
and the more important government is in large areas of economic life the greater&#13;
6/&#13;
the number and more thorough the organization of such groups is likely to be;&#13;
in addition, the extent of the losses expected by any particular group and the&#13;
7/&#13;
numbers affected will determine the energy behind the lobbying effort; and,&#13;
the likelihood that the political system will be receptive is itself a determinant&#13;
8/&#13;
of the number and intensity of lobbying efforts.&#13;
6/    Cable (1977, pp.47-8) points to the role of already existing pressure groups&#13;
and of the quality of organization as an explanation for success in lobbying&#13;
for protection.&#13;
7/    There is some support for the hypothesis that the number of people affected&#13;
is an important determinant of lobbying success. Cheh (1974), in his study&#13;
of the exceptions from linear tariff cuts by the United States in the&#13;
Kennedy round of the GATT, hypothesized that short-run labor adjustment&#13;
costs were the explanation. He found that the one significanit variable was&#13;
the size of the labor force in an industry. However, Anderson (1978) seems&#13;
to find opposite results for Australia, where the share in the labof force&#13;
of the protected industry was' not significant.&#13;
8/    On the band-wagon effect see Balassa (1978) p.14.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Why is the political system so receptive? Firstly, there is the&#13;
fact of nationalism, which underlies any bias towards the home market. Pro-&#13;
tectionist periods tend to be strongly nationalist periods, the main examples&#13;
in the past one hundred years being 1879 - 1914 and 1929 - 45 (Curzon 1965,&#13;
9/&#13;
pp. 16-27).   Secondly, there may be a general preference for industrial&#13;
activity, as Johnson has argued (1965), in both the developing and the developed&#13;
countries, with the result that any country finding its industrial sector&#13;
uncompetitive will have resort to protection. Thirdly, there is what Corden&#13;
has termed the "conservative social welfare function" (1974, pp. 107-12). By&#13;
this is meant the feeling of "unfairness" evoked by the sight of any group&#13;
experiencing substantial income losses; the desire to avoid risk; the aim of&#13;
preserving social peace, that might be jeopardized by any major changes in&#13;
relative incomes; and the aim for a democratic government of avoiding changes&#13;
10/&#13;
that make it likely that it will lose power (Ibid., pp. 107-8).     Fourthly,&#13;
9/    A related hypothesis is that liberal international policies require the&#13;
existence of a dominant, liberal "leader" (i.e. Britain before 1880 and&#13;
the United States after 1945). This thesis is advanced in Kindleberger&#13;
(1973).&#13;
10/   It is not easy to provide compelling evidence for the existence of such&#13;
a "conservative social welfare. function". However, Streeten (1973, p.36)&#13;
has argued "The better off a society is the more it can afford to forgo&#13;
extra increases in production for the sake of less disruption, particularly&#13;
if such disruption continues to be called for repeatedly or if its benefits&#13;
are mainly enjoyed by others". Dell (February and October, 1977) seems&#13;
to be saying virtually the same thing. If generally held, such views&#13;
provide support for the existence of a "conservative social welfare function",&#13;
as does the prevalence of income related social welfare payments by the state.&#13;
Equally telling evidence is the widespread acceptance of the arguments about&#13;
maintaininR  "differentials" in wage bargaining (Lal, 1977, p.33).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
there is the feeling that protection is not incompatible with a market economy,&#13;
does not have the degrading implications of permanent subsidies (and, indeed,&#13;
being invisible, is much less likely to change), and usually involves small&#13;
intervention in the affairs of an industry.    For all of these reasons protection&#13;
is more acceptable both to the recipients and the rest of the community than other&#13;
11/&#13;
sorts of permanent assistance.     Fifthly, (and this is of particular relevance&#13;
for trade with developing countries), in countries that accept the competitive&#13;
system as moral, this is not because of what economists think of as efficiency,&#13;
but because it is seen as fair that in a competition between equally placed&#13;
individuals and groups those who use opporttnities better should prosper at the&#13;
expense of the others. However, the essence of comparative advantage is that it&#13;
hinges on advantages over which individuals have no control. Thus, it is seen&#13;
as. "unfair" that a South Korean entrepreneur can wipe out a competitor in a&#13;
developed country, not because of any virtue inherent in himself, but merely&#13;
because of access to cheap labor. This form of competition has recently attracted&#13;
11/   Fels (1976, pp. 98-101) provides an interesting discussion of the reasons&#13;
for the acceptability of protectionist action in a generally market-&#13;
oriented country like West Germany. He points out that from the point of&#13;
view of the general public: (1) nominal protection is considered to be.low;&#13;
(2) protection has also been declining; (3) residual protection is seen-as&#13;
having value from the point of view of regional balance; (4) protection&#13;
is thought to be a marktkonformes Mittel (i.e. a policy consistent with&#13;
the market); (5) protection is the responsibility of the EEC, whose decisions&#13;
are generally looked on more favorably than those of the government; and&#13;
(6) there is a general ideological hostility to subsidies, which are seen&#13;
as somehow different from protection. Correspondingly, producers prefer&#13;
high prices to subsidies because they "do not like to become pensioners of&#13;
the government" (Ibid., p.99), and because they fear that subsidies presage&#13;
direct government interference.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
12/&#13;
the label "social dumping".     Finally, especially in countries or at times when&#13;
much of the economy is seen as vulnerable, generalized protectionist sentiment&#13;
can attach itself particularly to those imports, which are seen as unstoppable&#13;
because of their "supercompetitiveness", as it has sometimes been called. It is&#13;
natural to deny the theory of comparative advantage, to generalize that com-&#13;
petitive margin to all tradeable goods (or at least all manufactures), and fear&#13;
that free trade means free disposal of your own industrial economy. It is at&#13;
this point that protectionism needs no lobbies, and that the entire country,&#13;
including the government, acts to shut out the threatening interloper, be it&#13;
Japan or some other highly competitive and rapidly growing economy. In certain&#13;
cases, this fear of the competitor may be added to the desire to control and plan&#13;
the domestic economy, which requires a degree of certainty not available to an&#13;
12/   The number of advertisements and pieces of propaganda arguing that the&#13;
developing countries' advantage is "unfair" is legion. Thus, union&#13;
representatives at a recent ILO conference on trade between developing&#13;
and developed countries argued that they opposed imports that were the&#13;
result of dumping, "social exploitation" (sic), or government subsidies&#13;
(ILO July 1978, pp.5-6). See also Dell (1977). Sinclair (1978(A),&#13;
Chapter 4, p.6) quotes the President of the Sheffield Chamber of Commerce&#13;
as saying "it is clear that the subsistence level of wages in countries&#13;
like South Korea do not enable free trading to be carried out". He also&#13;
cites cutlery manufacturers as,stating that they seek competition with&#13;
countries of "similar economic and social conditions" (Ibid., p.16). In&#13;
assessing these arguments it is not necessary to assume that the producers&#13;
themselves believe in them or that they are any more than a convenient&#13;
tool to them. The fact that they are used indicates that they are con-&#13;
sidered politically useful and, therefore, generally accepted.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
open, trading nation.'3/   Greiger (1978, p. 111) argues indeed that this is&#13;
a possible consequence of current tendencies in the evolution of European&#13;
welfare states.&#13;
When this daunting list of sources of protectionist sentiment&#13;
;Ini .ICL-ion i3s reviewed, it is difficult to understand why protection is ever&#13;
prevented. However, there are some countervailing factors. A government may&#13;
be convinced that free trade is in its own interests. This was the case for&#13;
Britain for:nearly a century. Free trade may also be regarded as beneficial&#13;
to the achievement of some global political objective, as was the case for the&#13;
United States after the Second World War. Again, there may be fear of retaliation,&#13;
especially if existing commercial policy has been decided in international&#13;
14/&#13;
negotiations, which involved explicit reciprocal commitments.     Finally, domestic&#13;
political forces, including some producers, wholesalers and retailers may act&#13;
15/&#13;
as a lobby for liberal trade in general or in any particular instance.&#13;
13/   As Portes (1978, p.28)remarks, "... central plans cannut accommodate the&#13;
uncertainty associated with giving agents outside the scope of regulation&#13;
by the plan free access to the goods produced and allocated under the plan".&#13;
14/   Cable (1977, p.46) cites the British Prime Minister as saying "it would&#13;
not be in the interests of jobs in Britain if we were to take action&#13;
which provoked retaliation against these exports".&#13;
15/   Multinational companies with vertically integrated production across national&#13;
boundaries are, it is argued, a powerful factor in resisting some pro-&#13;
tectionism and promoting some liberalization (e.g. Offshore Assembly&#13;
Provisions in tariff codes). Helleiner (1978, p.19) argues that their&#13;
influence is likely to exceed that of workers in industries which they&#13;
dominate and that they will favor liberalization that facilitates intra-firm&#13;
trade.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -&#13;
In sum, adjustment will be permitted,rather than prevented through&#13;
protectionism,depending on the extent of the costs borne by groups in the society,&#13;
on the probability that "voice" will be exercised, and on the chances that it&#13;
will be "heard" by the political system. For reasons to be considered in the&#13;
succeeding section, it appears that exports from developing countries are prime&#13;
candidates for hostile reaction at all these stages.&#13;
C. Protection and the Costs of Adjustment -&#13;
Trade with Developing Countries&#13;
a.    The Bias Against the Developing Countries&#13;
We have argued that policies to interfere with trade are probably&#13;
the most common defensive interventions by government. Direct subsidization is also&#13;
often directed against competition from abroad which for one reason or another&#13;
cannot be met by protectionist action. It is rare for governments to intervene&#13;
to prevent internal competition. Indeed, even employment subsidization itself&#13;
is only likely to have a beneficial effect on employment if it displaces foreign&#13;
production. Howeve; it also seems likely that there is special discrimination&#13;
against changes brought about by imporu from developing countries. What is the&#13;
evidence for this bias?&#13;
One approach is to point to the low level of market penetration by&#13;
the developing countries, both overall and in the product groups in which they&#13;
have specialized. Thus, in 1975 the developing countriest share in the imports&#13;
of manufactures by developed countries was 8.9 percent and in consumption was&#13;
1.2 percent (World Bank 1978, Table 26). The share of developing countries in the&#13;
consumption of textiles and clothing in 1974 was 4 percent in the United States,&#13;
8 percent in Germany and 6 percent in the United Kingdom (Ibid., p.17). It is only&#13;
in narrowly defined product groups in particular marlkets, e.g. radlos and black and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
white television sets in the United States, that market penetration is really high&#13;
(Ibid., p.29). Perhaps the most striking statistic is that, until the recent reces-&#13;
sion, the annual increments in trade in manufactures among developed countries ex-&#13;
ceeded the total level of their imports from developing countries.    Yet, in spite&#13;
of this very modest presence, the concern expressed has been very great and,. in&#13;
certain cases, such as the recent renegotiation of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA),&#13;
action has been drastic.&#13;
Evidence for a bias in protection against developing countries is&#13;
provided in lqbal (1974, p.18), who concluded that, at least for the United States&#13;
and the United Kingdom, "the structure of effective tariff protection.... is&#13;
significantly and positively correlated with the comparative advantage of less&#13;
developed countries in manufacturing activities". Fels (1976, p.112) notes that&#13;
in Germany "Some of the highly assisted industries in manufacturing are exposed&#13;
to strong import competition from developing countries". Stronger support is&#13;
given by Hiemenz and Rabenau (1976, p.40), who conclude their study of effective&#13;
protection in German industry by noting that protection is concentrated on raw&#13;
material processing and labor-intensive industries. Therefore, "The structure&#13;
of West German protection - and the same is true for most industrialized countries -&#13;
mainly reduces the access of developing nations to German markets because these&#13;
nations are typically the main competitors in raw material and labor-intensive&#13;
16/&#13;
products."    Walter and Chung (1972, p.125) conclude their study of non-tariff&#13;
barriers by remarking "the specific characteristics of non-tariff obstacles,&#13;
taken as a group, result in significant variations in their relative impact on&#13;
16/   A fortiori what is true for West Germany is likely to be true for the EEC&#13;
as a whole, since the countries have common tariffs and trade policies.&#13;

foreign suppliers, particularly as between exporting developed and developing&#13;
countries. This is because they tend to be applied most frequently to products&#13;
in which developing countries presently have or are establishing a competitive&#13;
advantage in the international market, and because the impact of individual NTBs&#13;
tends almost uniformly to bear disproportionately on developing-country suppliers.&#13;
In this respect, the biases against developing countries inherent in the structure&#13;
of non-tariff protection appear to parallel those indicated by existing tariff&#13;
structures". Leaving aside the specific point of bias against the developing&#13;
countries,the extent of barriers to developing countries' exports, including the&#13;
problem of transport costs, is amply documented by Yeats (1974 and 1978). However,&#13;
he also notes one important aspect of the process of bias creation, namely the&#13;
developing countries' lack of participation in negotiations on tariff reductions.&#13;
Thus, he remarks (1978, p.113),"The differential trade benefits from the Kennedy&#13;
Round were noted by the UNCTAD secretariat which estimated that the average&#13;
tariff reduction for products of interest to developing countries was only about&#13;
20 percent as opposed to a general reduction of about 35 to 40 percent for industrial&#13;
17/18/&#13;
nations".&#13;
17/   The literature on the topic is vast.   Yeats (1978, p.210) gives his overall&#13;
assessment of the bias against developing countries. There is also an&#13;
argument that trade liberalization is biased in favor of intra-industrial&#13;
trade (Hufbauer and Chilas, 1974) and that, since exports and imports tend&#13;
to be more similar between any pair of developed countries than between a&#13;
developed and a developing country (Hufbauer, 1970, p.205), trade liberalization&#13;
in developed countries will be biased against trade with developing countries.&#13;
18/   Trade liberalization within the EEC is a fortiori biased largely against the&#13;
developing countries, with the Lome convention a modest offset.&#13;

b.    The Impact of the Exports of Developing Countries&#13;
b.i. Industries&#13;
At the overall level, no issue arises, since the OECD trade surplus&#13;
with the rest of the world in manufactures has grown steadily in real terms.&#13;
OECD (1979, Table 9) shows that the export surplus in 1976 prices grew from&#13;
US$ 40.7 billion in 1963 to US$ 99.3 billion in 1974 and US$ 119.6 billion in&#13;
1977. While the-situation varies among countries (the United States, for example,&#13;
has experienced a declining surplus and then a deficit with what the OECD calls&#13;
the "Newly Industrializing Countries") (Ibid., Table 10), it is clear that overall&#13;
the industrial sectors of the developed countries are larger than they would be&#13;
without trade with developing countries.&#13;
However, the exports of the developing countries do have an effect&#13;
on the structure of manufactured output. Some sectors or lines of production&#13;
grow in relation to what they would otherwise be and others shrink. It appears&#13;
that the commodity range of developing countries' manufactured exports is relatively&#13;
homogeneous (Hufbauer 1970, p.201).      (On the other hand, as Donges and Riedel&#13;
(1977, Table 3) have shown, in the course of development export diversification&#13;
has proceeded apace). It is argued that, because of the undiversified nature of&#13;
developing countries' exports and t.he concentration of their imports in investment&#13;
goods (Wolf 1978, Table 29), their trade with the developed countries is largely&#13;
19/&#13;
inter-industrial rather than intra--industrial.     It is also argued that intra-&#13;
industrial trade creates smaller adjustment costs than inter-industrial trade.&#13;
Whatever the value of such arguments, it should be remembered that for developed&#13;
19/   The high level of what is measured as intra-industrial trade is well-&#13;
established for trade among developed countries (Balassa, January 1979,&#13;
pp.1-2) and for certain groups of developing countries trading among them-&#13;
selves (Ibid., pp. 5-18).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-64 -&#13;
countries as a group, exports to the developing countries are so much larger&#13;
than imports that net exports are seldom negative for a broadly&#13;
defined industry such as 'textiles', 'clothing', 'electrical engineering' or&#13;
'non-electrical engineering'. Thus, at a high level of aggregation it is only in&#13;
a few cases (and clothing is one), that trade with developing countries has led&#13;
to a contraction of the industry vis-a-vis what it would have been without that&#13;
trade. However, there are three qualifications: first, at a narrower level&#13;
(for example, T-shirts, transistor radios, or black and white television sets) large&#13;
negative trade balances occur. Second, what is true for the developed countries&#13;
taken together is not true for individual countries, and it is at that level that&#13;
most decisions about protection are taken. Thus, Fels (1972, Chart 3) shows&#13;
that by 1969 West Germany was already in deficit in clothing, leather products,&#13;
footwear, textiles, and the group consisting of musical instruments, toys,&#13;
jewellery and sporting goods. Finally, even if the effect of trade with develop-&#13;
ing countries on an industry is to make it bigger than it otherwise would be,&#13;
in certain cases recent change in the balance of trade has tended to cause a&#13;
contraction. Such a reduction in the developed countries' trade surplus with&#13;
the developing countries has happened in textiles.&#13;
What are the implications of exports of developing countries for&#13;
costs borne by those in the developed countries' competing industries? Two&#13;
issues arise:  the first concerns the situation of those whose output is directly&#13;
displaced by products from developing countries. The second concerns the in-&#13;
direct effect on the profitability of those producing close substitutes for what&#13;
is exported by developing countries.   As far as the former issue is concerned, it may&#13;
be argued that adjustment for workers and firms within an industry is easier than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
adjustment between industries, It may also be argued that developing countries&#13;
tend to be competitive across the range of output of any industry in which&#13;
they are competitive at all. If these assumptions were true, exports from&#13;
developing countries would seem to create relatively severe private costs for&#13;
those directly affected. However, there are difficulties with the argument.&#13;
In the first place, the tendency towards inter-industrial rather than intra-&#13;
industrial trade does not prove that developing countries are competitive in&#13;
all the activities within an industry. They may be competitive in only a few,&#13;
in which case their exports may have only a mild effect on the size of the affected&#13;
industry. In the second place, in most broadly-defined industries developing&#13;
countries both import and export. This may not be true for clothing or footwear,&#13;
but it certainly is true for textiles, electronics, other electrical machinery,&#13;
non-electrical machinery, and so forth. Finally, it is not clear that an&#13;
industry should be considered as an homogeneous entity, as far as factor&#13;
mobility is concerned. Indeed, there is considerable evidence against this&#13;
20/&#13;
proposition.&#13;
Rather than focus exclusively on the trade relationship, it may&#13;
be more illuminating to look at that in the context of the structure of the&#13;
industry itself.   The initial impact of the exports of developing countries&#13;
comes thrQugh the sale of certain products. Those who produce the same products&#13;
20/   Blackhurst, Marian and Tumlir (1978, p.79) argue that the concept of&#13;
intra-industrial trade has no useful bearing on the issue of adjustment&#13;
costs. Finger (1975) provides evidence on the wide range of conditions&#13;
to be discovered in what are conventionally called industries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 66 -&#13;
in the developed countries have a number of options. They may discover that&#13;
there are other products, within the competence of the affected firms, that&#13;
can be exported to developing countries in return; they may discover that there&#13;
are other products, again within the competence of the affected firms but not&#13;
within that of the developing countries, which face buoyant markets in developed&#13;
countries; they may discover a way of producing the affected products com-&#13;
petitively through cost reductions; they may find it possible to arrange vertical&#13;
specialization with producers in developing countries and thus abandon only some&#13;
stages of the production process; or, finally, when all else fails, they may&#13;
know that collapse of the firms will be followed by rapid re-employment of labor&#13;
at similar wages, while the owners of capital can obtain a good price for their&#13;
assets. Private costs for those directly affected will be high if none of these&#13;
conditions holds. Only the first of the escape routes is that of intra-industry&#13;
trade, although vertical specialization entails intra-industry trade when there&#13;
is an initial export to the developing country for further processing, and the&#13;
product exported is considered to be from the same statistically-defined industry&#13;
as the import. In the other cases there is inter-industry trade, but private&#13;
costs are, nevertheless, quite low. Furthermore, if the industry is characterized&#13;
by product diversity, but each firm specializes in particulat products and does&#13;
not know how to change, intra-industry trade will impose severe costs on those&#13;
affected by imports while providing benefits to the entirely different firms&#13;
who produce the exports. Private costs can be high in such a situation, especially&#13;
if factors are not readily transferable, in spite of the observation of intra-&#13;
industry trade. (Consider the strong pressure on, and protectionism of, certain&#13;
producers of consumer electronics in the United States, while producers of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 67 -&#13;
industrial electronic equipment like computers are in a strong competitive&#13;
position).  Thus, an observation of intra-industry trade,with all its statistical&#13;
flaws,is neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for low private costs.&#13;
What determines in any particular case the existence or acceptability&#13;
of one of the escape routes? It is important to dispel a false option, namely,&#13;
that of cost-reduction or process innovation. This is, in fact, what governments&#13;
often seem to mean by "adjustment" to imports. However, in practice, it usually&#13;
entails not only resistance to imports from developing countries but protection&#13;
or subsidization. If opportunities for cost reduction exist without protection&#13;
it has -to be assumed that the products were not being produced as efficiently&#13;
as possible-prior to the import competition. This is certainly possible, but&#13;
not generally probable. Thus, the aim of reducing the cost of production to&#13;
meet competition from developing countries usually entails subsidization at least&#13;
of investment. Alternatively, protection is required and a vested interest for&#13;
permanent protection is often created, partly because developing countries can&#13;
imitate most cost-reducing techniques.&#13;
What determines the availability of the other escape routes? If the&#13;
industry produces an homogeneous commodity, the likelihood is great that any&#13;
developing country comparative advantage will be across-the-board. The implica-&#13;
tions of firm size are unclear. Small firms may be producing a limited range&#13;
of standardized items and be very vulnerable. However, they may be producing&#13;
in batches to order and have considerable natural protection. Industries with&#13;
large firms and small firms side-by-side may see the competition of developing&#13;
countries giving an advantage to the larger,. because of the latter's ability&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
to specialize vertically across frontiers and because of their ability to&#13;
21/&#13;
diversify.    Diversified firms should have an advantage over undiversified&#13;
firms. Industries and firms whose products employ standard technologies and&#13;
are technically static     will be at a disadvantage because of the competitive&#13;
21/    The possibility of vertically integrated production across international&#13;
borders is one advantage that large firms have over small firms. For this&#13;
reason, industries dominated by the latter are likely unambiguously to&#13;
oppose imports from developing countries. In industries with a mixed&#13;
firm size, conflicts will arise. It is for that reason Hirono (1978, p.18)&#13;
remarks "it has been mainly the small and medium-sized enterprises in&#13;
Japan which have been pressured into a losing battle with exporting&#13;
manufacturers in developing countries which are often the subsidiaries&#13;
of large-scale Japanese and other foreign enterprises". Sinclair (1978 (A))&#13;
points to the strong conflicts of interest that have emerged within the&#13;
British cutlery industry between firms that import a large part of their&#13;
sales and those who do not. The former group includes one of the biggest&#13;
firms in the industry, Viner's, who obtain 54 percent of their profits&#13;
from sales of imported cutlery. The result has been a schism within the&#13;
"Cutlery and Silverware Association". Of even greater interest is the&#13;
opposition to the import of 'blanks' for finishing in the United Kingdom.&#13;
Some desire to keep the domestic components manufacturers in business,&#13;
especially the smaller firms, who purchase their components and feel un-&#13;
able to rely on imports. Thus, again there is a conflict between larger&#13;
firms able to sub-contract overseas and smaller firms, who cannot (Ibid.,&#13;
Section 3.7).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
22/&#13;
abilities of developing countries in such industries (Wolter 1977, p.112).&#13;
Lack of technical dynamism combined with product homogeneity will tend to close&#13;
most escape routes.   Firms with valuable brand names, (who often sell diverse&#13;
goods to consumers and are large), are usually in a good position to arrange&#13;
sub-contracting or find secure market niches. Finally, firms none of whose&#13;
potential products are protected by location will find it difficult to survive.&#13;
One might hypothesize that private costs, measured here either by the death of&#13;
the firm or by the size of its contraction will be ranked as follows: highest&#13;
for small firms producing homogeneous, standard products; then large firms also&#13;
producing homogeneous products; then small but diversified firms (perhaps pro-&#13;
ducing to order on a batch basis); then large, diversified firms, then large,&#13;
diversified firms which are technically dynamic or have valuable brand names;&#13;
and, lowest of all, firms in the last category able to benefit from vertical&#13;
integration across frontiers. In addition to-the effects of industrial structure,&#13;
mention must also be made of the rate of growth of demand for the products.&#13;
22/    Wolter (1977, p.112) argues that the revealed comparative advantage of&#13;
developing countries indicates that, at least vis-a-vis West Germany,&#13;
they are competitive in most goods with standardized production techniques,&#13;
whether labor- or physical-capital intensive, as well as in raw-material&#13;
intensive goods. The implication is that physical capital is highly&#13;
internationally mobile, at least to the most competitive developinR&#13;
countries. West Germany's comparative advantage is in goods that are inten-&#13;
sive in human skills, where innovation is important. Fels (1972, p.96)&#13;
also points out the relatively unimportant role of physical capital&#13;
intensity. Work on the United States has also indicated that human&#13;
capital is a crucial determinant of trade patterns.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
It is interesting to note that the large diversified firm offers&#13;
advantages other than its sheer ability to survive. It can use information&#13;
about its internal needs for labor to re-allocate workers and thus reduce&#13;
substantially the frictional cost of unemployment. The same applies to its&#13;
capital stock. Moreover, the ownership of such a company is likely to be&#13;
widely scattered in portfolios, none of which are dominated by the stock of&#13;
the company itself. For these reasons, even if the absolute size of the loss&#13;
is as great as that experienced by those engaged in a single-product industry&#13;
characterized by small manager-proprietor businesses, the burden on any group&#13;
of individuals is likely to be much smaller. Furthermore, such a firm may,&#13;
in fact, be a better   means of re-allocating labor than the labor market, and&#13;
thus reduce both social and private costs.&#13;
Firms competitive with developing countries are likely&#13;
to be in a poor position.        Developing countries       seem to have a com-&#13;
parative advantage in products with standardized production characteristics and&#13;
for which firm size is no great advantage. Product homogeneity also helps them&#13;
since it reduces market barriers and may make manufacture easier. Their com-&#13;
petitors in the developed world are often old, undynamic industries, whose out-&#13;
put comes from small, unsophisticated firms or from small firms alongside big&#13;
ones. Cotton textiles, clothing, footwear, and cutlery are all made by industries&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 71 -&#13;
23/&#13;
of this kind.    Steel and most shipbuilding are also characterized by single-&#13;
industry firms, although large ones, which are not very technically dynamic,&#13;
produce a fairly homogeneous product, and have few prospects for diversifica-&#13;
tion. In none of these industries is there strong brand loyalty, and, if any,&#13;
24/&#13;
it belongs to a few large firms.      Horizontal specialization, with developed&#13;
country producers concentrating on higher quality products (Balassa, January&#13;
1979, p.25), is not a viable long-term strategy if the product is homogeneous,&#13;
or if, as has happened in textiles and clothing, the developing countries are able&#13;
to upgrade their products rapidly. Thus, the ability of the directly affected&#13;
firms to survive by resort to any of the obvious escape routes is limited.     It&#13;
is in electrical engineering, in general, and electronics, in particular, that&#13;
compatible arrangements have most frequently been discovered and-that private&#13;
23/    We have not been able to collect consistent statistics for all these&#13;
industries. However, Miles (1968, pp.90-3) notes that in April, 1959&#13;
there were 928 single-process firms in the Lancashire cotton textile&#13;
industry, employing 138,000 people.    By 1965, these numbers had fallen&#13;
to 555 and 76,300, respectively. The share of such specialized firms&#13;
in total employment fell from 57.6 percent to 46.5 percent. 94 percent&#13;
of the firms in 1959 employed fewer than 500 people. In the cutlery&#13;
industry in the United Kingdom 64 percent of the total work-force was&#13;
employed by firms having 300 or fewer employees (Sinclair 1978 (A),&#13;
Section 2.3). In footwear 65 percent of the work-force was employed&#13;
in establishments with fewer than a thousand employees (Sinclair 1978&#13;
(B), Table 8). (These figures are for 1972.) Of course, small firms&#13;
can have decisive advantages, such as their flexibility and competitiveness&#13;
in batch production. The importance of such advantages in any particular&#13;
case needs examination.&#13;
24/    It is their name which allows a large cutlery firm like Viner's to import&#13;
profitably (Sinclair 1978 (A), Section 3.7). Otherwise, presumably,&#13;
importing would be done directly by retailers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
costs appear to have been lowest. This does not mean the absence of protectionist&#13;
pressure. However, when one considers that electrical engineering exports&#13;
from developing countries have grown as fast and are about as large as clothing&#13;
exports, the difference in the treatment of the two is striking. What matters&#13;
is that the industry is dynamic, technologically and in terms of market growth,&#13;
firms in the developed countries have been able to exploit the opportunities&#13;
created by trade with developing countries, and many of them are large, diversified,&#13;
and possess knowledge capital and market recognition for their products.&#13;
Implications for those directly affected are only one part&#13;
of the problem: indirect effects must also be considered. The key point&#13;
is that developing countries compete on price, and the result is downward&#13;
pressure on all those who produce close substitutes for the exported products,&#13;
even when the actual market penetration is modest (Keesing 1978, pp.22-3). The&#13;
wider the range of products, the greater the spread of this indirect effect on&#13;
the industries of developed countries.&#13;
What of the future impact on the firms and industries of developed&#13;
countries? The World Bank (1978, Table 26) estimates that in 1975-85, developing&#13;
countries will contribute 17.5 percent of the growth in manufactured imports, and&#13;
5.4 percent of the growth in consumption of manufactures, of developed countries.&#13;
The composition is difficult to predict. However, recent studies in West Germany hav:&#13;
the interesting and important implication that developing countries are likely to&#13;
be strong competitors not only in the obvious light manufactures, such as&#13;
clothing, leather products, musical instruments, toys, sporting goods, footwear,&#13;
woodwork, plastic products and textiles (Fels, 1972, p.100), but also in a wide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
range of standardized engineering products, such as metal products, switchgear,&#13;
wiring devices, household appliances, lighting fixtures, radio and TV sets,&#13;
bicycles, mountings and'fittings in mechanical engineering, sewing'machines,'&#13;
and standard tools (Giersch 1978, p.12). To this is likely to be added optical&#13;
equipment and simple cameras, and watches.   Thus, the range of industries and&#13;
firms likely to come under indirect pressure on prices and profits is likely&#13;
to grow rapidly, quite apart from the growth of the number displaced. Con-&#13;
sequently, the euthanasia of marginal firms and industries will, if not checked&#13;
by government intervention, proceed apace.&#13;
Obviously the argument needs more rigorous empirical examination.&#13;
However, some plausible conclusions do emerge concerning the ability of the&#13;
affected firms to survive and the indirect effects of developing countries'&#13;
exports. Firstly, it appears that many of the firms will not be able to&#13;
survive the onslaught, and this means high perceived private costs by those&#13;
immediately affected. Even if they can survive, contraction is likely. Secondly,&#13;
the indirect effects of the exports of develoning countries are significant,&#13;
and, consequently, a small degree of market penetration can have a'large effect on&#13;
the profitability of an industry. Thirdly, rapid diversification of developing&#13;
countries' exports can be expected without the abandonment of.any existing&#13;
penetration.w The result will be increa'singly strong eompetition for a host of.&#13;
firms producing standardized products without locational advantages, whether labor-&#13;
or physical-capital intensive.   The impact on the firms is-only the first stage of the&#13;
process. It is, of course, a good indication of the sorts of costs to be paid&#13;
by the sector-specific factors.   However, private costs also depend on what happens&#13;

to the factors of production that are released, and it is to this that we now&#13;
turn.&#13;
b. ii. Morkers&#13;
There is a vast and growing literature on the employment implica-&#13;
tions of trade. Thorough surveys are contained in Hsieh (1973), UNIDO (October&#13;
1978), and OECD (1979, Annex II). The various studies employ a wide range of&#13;
different approaches, from general equilibrium models, through analyses of the&#13;
direct employment effects and total employment effects ¢he latter within an&#13;
input-output framework), to decomposition procedures to incorporate the impact&#13;
of causes other than trade. Some studies seek to assess the impact of uni-&#13;
lateral liberalization; others focus on the consequences of specific proposals&#13;
for multilateral trade liberalization; yet others analyze the impact of&#13;
balanced trade expansion with developing countries; some are concerned&#13;
only with the effects on particularly sensitive industries; and there are still&#13;
others that focus on the effects of actual trade with developing countries,&#13;
either in the past or the future. What can be usefully learned for the particular&#13;
problem of trade with developing countries from this cornucopia of the economist's&#13;
art? In the first place, the estimates of the ratio of labor. requirements to out-&#13;
put in balanced trade with developing countries range disconcertingly from 0.65&#13;
for direct labor requirements in the OECD (Balassa 1979), and for the ratio of&#13;
total labor requirements in the USA (Grinols and Thorbecke 1978), to 0.84 for total&#13;
labor requirements in Belgium (de Grauwe et al 1977), 0.93 in the Netherlands&#13;
(Kol and Mennes 1978), and 0.96 in Germany (Schumacher 1977). In the second&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
place, the effect of actual trade with developing countries is undoubtedly&#13;
positive, because of the size of the surplus in trade in manufactures of&#13;
OECD countries with developing countries (Balassa (1979) for the OECD, Grinols&#13;
and Thorbecke (1978) for the shift in the trade balance of the USA with develop-&#13;
ing countries between 1963 and 1975, and Commissariat G6ne'ral du Plan (1978)&#13;
for France).   However, if Balassa and Grinols and Thorbecke are right about the&#13;
ratios of labor coefficients the impact will become negative if trade in&#13;
manufactures with developing countries balances. Finally, where comparison is&#13;
made with other sources of change, especially productivity growth, imports turn out&#13;
to be relatively insignificant (Wolter (1977) for Germany, Cabit (1977) for the&#13;
United Kingdom, Frank (1978) and Krueger (1979) on the United States of America).&#13;
Estimates of the net employment impact of trade with developing&#13;
countries are unfortunately virtually irrelevant to an analysis of either the&#13;
social or the private costs of trade. The social cost of change is, as we have&#13;
observed above, essentially a short-term phenomenon that depends on the time path&#13;
and structure of unemployment in comparison with what it would otherwise have&#13;
been, on the value of output forgone from unemployed resources, and on the&#13;
value of output from new sources of employment. All of these follow from the&#13;
precise nature of the distortions assumed. Since the models possess no-.adjustment&#13;
mechanisms, they can tell us nothing about this. In the long term there. is no&#13;
reason to suppose that any particular economic change will lead to a permanent&#13;
change in unemployment in accordance with models that assume fixed labor-output&#13;
coefficients in a range of very broadly-defined industries. However, the models&#13;
can tell us something usefui about private costs since they estimate the gross&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
labor displacement due to trade in comparison with other sources of change;&#13;
the employment characteristics of those displaced; and the effect on the com-&#13;
position of the demand for labor and thus on the need for changes in relative&#13;
prices and in the training and location of labor. As the private costs borne&#13;
by those employed in import-competing industry are probably the major political&#13;
factor in protectionism, the information provided is useful. However, the cost&#13;
to anyone unemployed is not determined only the the fact of unemployment, but&#13;
also by its duration and the size of the income reduction, and these will also&#13;
be considered.&#13;
Frank (1977, Table 3-5) indicates that for his import-competing&#13;
industries in the US, productivity change contributed a decline in employment of 2.9&#13;
percent per annum between 1963 and 1971, compared with a decline of only 0.9&#13;
percent per annum due to import growth and of 0.5 percent per annum due to net&#13;
trade. In absolute terms this meant a job reduction, ceteris paribus,of 590,000 due to&#13;
imports (of which 295,000 were displaced due to imports from developing countries),&#13;
compared with about 1.9 million displaced by productivity gain (Ibid., Tables 3-6 and&#13;
3-9). For West Germany, Wolter (1977, Table A6) gives the total displacement&#13;
in manufacturing for 1962-75 due to productivity change at 6.5 million, com-&#13;
pared with 1.7 million for imports and 133,000 for imports from developing&#13;
countries. For the United Kingdom, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office (1979, Table&#13;
17) indicates that for 1970-75 the contribution of productivity change in&#13;
industries competing with developing countries was a decline in employment of&#13;
211,000, while all imports brought about a reduction of 131,000 and those from&#13;
developing countries one of 38,000. In sum, imports were a relatively unimportant&#13;
source of job displacement.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
The employment displaced by exports from developing countries is&#13;
industrially concentrated. Thus Frank (1977, Table 3-9) shows that of the total&#13;
jobs lost in the US due to imports from developing countries .25 percent were in&#13;
electrical equipment and supplies, 18 percent were in apparel, 11 percent were&#13;
in transport equipment, and 9 percent were in primary metal products. (Surprisingly,&#13;
between 1964 and 1971 only 2,000 jobs were lost in textiles). For West Germany,&#13;
Wolter (1977, Table A6) indicates that 35 percent of the jobs lost between 1962&#13;
and 1975 due to the exports of developing countries were in clothing, 18 percent&#13;
were in textiles and 9 percent were in electrical engineering. While there is this&#13;
degree of industrial concentration, it should be noted that, even in the most&#13;
affected industries, productivity change was more important than import growth as&#13;
a source of job displacement. Thus, for the United States for 1963-71 Frank&#13;
(1977, Table 3-4) shows that productivity change led to an annual reduction in&#13;
employment, ceteris paribus, of 6.2 percent in apparel, 2.8 percent in electrical&#13;
equipment, and 1.9 percent in transportation equipment. Corresponding figures&#13;
for the effect of all imports were -0.8 percent, -1.8 percent, and -0.7 percent&#13;
respectively, and for net trade were -0.8 percent, -1.1 percent and 0.3 percent.&#13;
For the United Ki-ngdoo, Cable (1977, Table 3) shows that in footwear the job dis-&#13;
placement between 1970 and 1975 due to productivity change was 8,100, that in&#13;
clothing was 81,900, in cotton textiles (fabrics) 4,700, and in textile yarns 11,000;&#13;
corresponding figures for the loss due to net import penetration by developing&#13;
countries were 1,710, 19,450, 2,225, and 215. For West Germany, Wolter (1977,&#13;
Table A6) gives the ratio of productivity change to imports from developing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 78-&#13;
countries as a source of job displacement at 3.5 to one for clothing, 19 to one&#13;
for textiles, and 100 to one for electrical engineering.&#13;
Whatever the relative importance of productivity change, it is&#13;
probably more nearly neutral in its effects across industries. Trade with&#13;
developing countries changes the industrial structure of employment quite&#13;
markedly. Schumacher (1978, p.8) shows the net employment effect of a balanced&#13;
growth in West Germany's trade with developing countries of DM 1 billion in&#13;
accordance with the 1972-76 commodity structure of trade growth. The overall&#13;
net reduction is only 836, but in clothing it is 5,795, and in textiles it is&#13;
3,299. Large net increases in employment occur in machinery construction&#13;
(3,746) and road vehicle construction (2,396). Moreover, it should not be&#13;
assumed that it is only net changes in the employment in any industry that&#13;
matter. As we have remarked above, large reductions in employment in any&#13;
industry, even if offset by growth in the same industry due to exports, are not&#13;
irrelevant to private costs, since the firms are not likely to be identical and,&#13;
consequently, workers will have to move from one employer to another, even within&#13;
an industry. This will also impose costs, even if they may be somewhat smaller&#13;
than for inter-industrial job transfer. Looking at gross employment loss due&#13;
to increased imports, the same study showed that 25 percent of the gross dis-&#13;
placement occurs in clothing, 16 percent in textiles, and 11 percent in electrical&#13;
equipment. Of the gross employment exppnsion, 21 percent is in machinery con-&#13;
struction, 13 percent in electrical equipment, and 13 percent in road vehicle&#13;
construction. Gross and net changes are similar to each other for clothing,&#13;
textiles, machinery, and vehicle construction, but for electrical equipment the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
reduction (-2,614) is close to the expansion (2,998). Thus, in the first&#13;
four cases, the effect of trade with developing countries is unambiguously&#13;
negative or positive, while in the case of electrical equipment there will&#13;
be gains and losses and, correspondingly, structural change.&#13;
An important issue is that of the characteristics of workers who are&#13;
displaced. There is a very high proportion of women employed in the most&#13;
sensitive industries.   Fels and Glisman (1975, Table A2) report for West Germany&#13;
that the share' of female employees in total employment in 1968 was 82 percent in&#13;
clothing, 61 percent in leather products, 59 percent in footwear, 55 percent -in&#13;
textiles, 37 percent in electrical engineering, and 30 percent in manufacturing&#13;
as a whole.     However,   there is no obvious tendency for the&#13;
share of foreign workers to be high, textiles being the most important&#13;
exception. Wolter (1977, Table 5) supports this conclusion by pointing to the&#13;
high negative rank correlation between West Germany's revealed comparative&#13;
advantage and the proportion of female workers in an industry. The very high&#13;
proportion of women affected is supported for the United Kingdom by Cable (1977,&#13;
Table 4), with women's shares in employment in sensitive industries very similar&#13;
to those in West Germany. Furthermore, wages in the affected industries tend to be&#13;
markedly lower than average (Fels and Glisman 1975, Table A2; Cable 1977, Table&#13;
4), although it is not clear whether this is because of the composition of&#13;
employment-in the affected industries or lower pay for the same skills. In the&#13;
third place, displaced workers are relatively unskilled. Schumacher (1978, p.10)&#13;
shows that balanced trade growth with developing countries of DM 1 billion for&#13;
West Germany, again using the 1972-76 commodity structure of trade growth, leads&#13;
to a fall of 2,431 in the demand for people with no vocational training, and a rise&#13;
of 1,044 in demand for more skilled workers. Similar information on the differential&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 80 -&#13;
skill impact of trade with developing countries is contained in Balassa (1979),&#13;
who indicates that "the share of professional and technical workers in total&#13;
employment is about two-thirds higher in the exports than in the imports of&#13;
manufactured goods in the OECD countries in trade with the developing countries"&#13;
(Ibid., p.22).&#13;
What are the prospects for labor displacement due to the exports of develc&#13;
ing countries?  Obviously, this depends on how fast the exports are expected to&#13;
grow.  A number of studies of the prospects for West Germany exist.   Wolter (1977,&#13;
Table 16) gives projections for 1973-85, which are based on a continuation of&#13;
trends for 1962 to 1974. Gross employment displacement is projected at 846,000&#13;
overall (about 11 percent of 1975 employment in manufacturing), while gross&#13;
employment growth due to increased exports is set at 400,000. By contrast, the&#13;
total displacement due to imports from developing countries for 1962-75 is&#13;
given as only 133,000. In order of size the gross import displacement by industry&#13;
(with percent of 1975 employment in parentheses), is 300,000 in electrical&#13;
engineering (30 percent), 204,000 in clothing (71 percent), 61,000 in transport&#13;
equipment (9 percent), 57,000 in precision and optical goods (37 percent),&#13;
45,000 in leather products and shoes (47 percent), and 41,000 in textiles (11&#13;
percent). Of the total employment growth 76 Percent is in mechanical engineering&#13;
(which contributes almost half on its own), electrical engineering and transport&#13;
equipment. In fact, the net change projected for the last mentioned is negligible.&#13;
It is clear that some industries, and especially clothing, would tend to disappear,&#13;
and the shifts in tha industrial structure of employment would be considerable. It&#13;
is interesting to note from the same source that the expected displacement of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
846,000 is a little more than half of the actual displacement of 1,684,000&#13;
for 1962-75 from all imports. However, the latter was much more evenly dis-&#13;
tributed. For France, Haas (1978, p.46), in his background contribution to&#13;
the already mentioned study by the Commissariat General du Plan, projects the&#13;
1976-85 employment displacement on the basis of 1970-76 trends at 344,000 (6&#13;
percent of total employment in manufacturing in 1976). 52 percent of the loss&#13;
is expected to be in textiles and clothing, and a further 28 percent in&#13;
25/&#13;
mechanical and electrical engineering.    For the United Kingdom, the estimate&#13;
in the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's paper (1979, p.43) that the increase&#13;
in imports from Newly Industrialising Countries might amount to 8 percent of&#13;
manufacturing output over the next decade implies a somewhat greater gross dis-&#13;
26/&#13;
placement of labor.     (This follows from the relatively greater labor intensity&#13;
of these imports). Thus, the displacement of labor in relation to manufacturing&#13;
employment, and probably its distribution as well, would be similar to that&#13;
projected for West Germany.&#13;
The work on Germany assumes that imports from developing countries&#13;
will grow at rates similar to those of the 1960s and early 1970s. That on France&#13;
25/   The employment displacement in France is lower in absolute terms than&#13;
that in Germany, both because of the more modest initial penetration and&#13;
the smaller labor force in manufacturing. The former is the more important.&#13;
26/   The Newly Industrializing Countries according to this definition consist&#13;
of countries counted as developing countries in World Bank (1978) except&#13;
for the addition of Poland and Hungary. The omission of all the small&#13;
developing country exporters of manufactures and the inclusion of Poland&#13;
and Hungary makes no significant difference to the overall estimate cited&#13;
in the text.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
assumes a continuation bf'1970-76 trends, and that on the United Kingdom assumes&#13;
that imports from the "Newly Industrialising Countries" will increase at 14 per-&#13;
cent per annum. Estimates by Balassa (1979), which are based on projections in&#13;
World Bank (1978), assume that the growth rate for manufactured imports of OECD&#13;
countries from developing countries between 1976 and 1986 will be 12.6 percent&#13;
per annum. This is lower than past trends. The resulting gross labor dis-&#13;
placement is projected at 1.75 million, (which happens to be almost exactly the&#13;
same as the projected growth of employment in OECD manufactured exports to&#13;
developing countries), and this is equal to 2.5 percent of total OECD manufacturing&#13;
employment in 1976. Balassa's projection for the whole OECD is, therefore, sub-&#13;
stantially below those for France, Germany and the United Kingdom, which we have&#13;
cited. The difference results from a lower assumed growth rate of imports and&#13;
lower penetration of imports in some other OECD countries.&#13;
It is obviously difficult to know which projection is likely to prove&#13;
correct. Balassa's are valuable in that they show the implications of what the&#13;
World Bank considers to be a minimally satisfactory rate of export growth from&#13;
developing countries. The following points are worth noting: firstly, the&#13;
projected gross displacement is.about twice that from the same cause between&#13;
1960 and 1976; secondly, if productivity growth were to average 2.5 percent per&#13;
annum, it would be somewhat more than ten times as important overall as imports&#13;
from developing countries as a source of labor displacement; thirdly, if liberal&#13;
policies were to be pursued in such sectors as clothing, footwear, and leather&#13;
products, displacement by trade could begin to rival that by productivity growth&#13;
in these sectors; fourthly, structural change could be substantial, with the main&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 833 -&#13;
beneficiaries being engineering goods and skilled labor; finally, the effect&#13;
would be still larger if indirect employment effects were included - a study&#13;
of West Germany concludes that direct and indirect effects together are 50&#13;
percent greater than direct effects alone, with more employment lost in textiles&#13;
due to the increased imports of clothing than from imports of textiles them-&#13;
selves (UNIDO 1978, Table 23). In sum, while still very far indeed from a&#13;
dominant source of employment change, imports of manufactures from developing&#13;
countries could become a significant factor in manufacturing as a whole and&#13;
a decisive one in some industries, if reasonably rapid growth from developing&#13;
countries were to continue.&#13;
What does it cost society and the individuals concerned to lose their&#13;
employment? Strangely, while most of the estimates of actual employment dis-&#13;
placement by developing countries' exports are for West Germany, those of the&#13;
27/&#13;
costs are for the United States and the United Kingdom.    Some estimates of the&#13;
cost per worker displaced are contained in Bale (1976), whose figures are based&#13;
on interviews with workers who had been recipients of trade adjustment assistance&#13;
under the Trade Expansion Act of 1962. His estimates are in 1972 prices. The&#13;
workers had been laid off in 1969-70 from firms manufacturing shoes, pianos,&#13;
silver flatware, textiles, radio electronics and glass products. Thus, the&#13;
industries affected were representative of those under pressure from developing&#13;
countries' exports. Under his first method of calculation, the wage cost of&#13;
the average 31 weeks of unemployment for those actively in the labor force was&#13;
$3,370; from this transfer payments of $2,059 were to be deducted, making a&#13;
cost rer worker of $1,311. However, Bale discovered that the new wage tended&#13;
27/   For the United States most of the analyses of trade are concerned with all&#13;
trade and not just with developing countries. The difference between the&#13;
interest in developing countries' exports in Germany and in all trade in the&#13;
United States is probably explained by the fact that in the former the bulk of&#13;
trade with developed countries, namely, that within the EEC, is outside the&#13;
political debate. Thus, trade with developing countries plays the role of&#13;
marginal irritant that trade as a whole does in the United States.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 84 &#13;
to be lower than the old. If this were to remain the case for only a year&#13;
more, the additional private cost was $618; if it were to remain the case for&#13;
the rest of the employee's working life, the additional cost was $8,318, dis-&#13;
counted at 5 percent per annum. 15 percent of the affected workers had left&#13;
the labor force, but Bale does not attempt to estimate the costs of those who&#13;
had done so because of the loss of the job. He also ignores loss of fringe&#13;
benefits and expected wage rises, costs of job search and retraining, and, on&#13;
the other side, the value of leisure. It seems likely that the true private&#13;
cost has been underestimated, but this depends on the value imputed to leisure.&#13;
Unfortunately, numbers like those of Bale, while fairly readily&#13;
applicable to a case of instantaneous liberalization of a marginal kind, cannot&#13;
be applied to a sustained policy of liberalism towards the exports of developing&#13;
countries in contrast with one of strict protection. The difficulty is particu-&#13;
larly great with the calculation of social costs. Bale's numbers themselves&#13;
are unreliable guides to the social value of lost production when non-marginal&#13;
changes are occurring, and, more particularly, a rapid reduction in the labor&#13;
force in any industry must be taken to imply that the marginal product is less&#13;
than the wage.  More serious still, it is quite unclear that over the long term&#13;
a liberal policy will generate higher unemployment than an illiberal one:&#13;
theoretical job displacement does not imply actual lay-offs when demand is&#13;
growing and there is natural wastage; and workers would easily learn to anticipate&#13;
where opportunitiec were disappearing and where they were being created. Even&#13;
in the short run the net increase in unemployment is impossible to calculate.&#13;
The numbers seem better suited to calculation of the private costs of those&#13;
directly affected. Since this is the main element in the political resistance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 85 -&#13;
to liberal policy, such a calculation might be valuable, in order to learn&#13;
how large the compensation might need to be. If one were to follow Balassa&#13;
and also assume that over a decade the manufactured exports of developing&#13;
countries to the United States would remain about half of their 'total manufactured&#13;
exports to developed countries, displacement in the United States would be about&#13;
850,000 jobs. From Bale's calculations a value of $2,000 seems to be a reason-&#13;
able estimate of the private cost per worker in 1972 prices. Updated to 1976&#13;
prices by the average increase in hourly earnings, the figure rises to $2,750.&#13;
The total private cost of job displacement would then be $2.3 billion over ten&#13;
years. If one were to add the cost already borne by public transfer programs,&#13;
the total would be double at about $4.5 billion.&#13;
As it happens, this calculation is useless for either of its two&#13;
possible purposes. In the first place, 850,000 is not a correct estimate of&#13;
the number virtually laid off due to imports, since that depends on whether the&#13;
required reduction in jobs exceeds natural wastage after allowing for demand&#13;
growth. In almost any conceivable circumstances, natural wastage will take&#13;
care of most of the long term reduction in labor requirements. Let us assume&#13;
as the representative import-affected industry one with imports accounting for&#13;
15 percent of current consumption,,with import growth at 15 percent per annum,&#13;
demand growth at 3 percent per annum, and productivity growth at 3 percent per&#13;
annum. Then, over a decade domestic output falls by 14 percent, and employment&#13;
by 35 percent, or at an annual compound rate of 4.2 percent per annum. Thus,&#13;
none of those theoretically displaced need ever be involuntarily unemployed as&#13;
a result of imports. In the second place, any actual compensation program could&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
not distinguish between those displaced by imports or by productivity growth.&#13;
Thus, payments would have to be made to all those involuntarily laid off&#13;
in an import-affected industry. In the ewample given above the total&#13;
reduction-in the industry's employment is 35 percent, and it may be necessary&#13;
to provide compensation to almost all of those leaving the industry. This figure&#13;
may be greater or less than the number "displaced" by imports, depending on the&#13;
28/&#13;
other characteristics of the industry concerned.      In our example, actual com-&#13;
pensation paid would be close to the theoretical calculation of import "displacement",&#13;
even though without a compensation program it is likely that no lay-offs would&#13;
ever be required.&#13;
28/ Decomposition can be carried out in accordance with the following formula:&#13;
AL = 1    D    + 1 bX     - I AM     -     P&#13;
L    L P+iP     L P+AP     L  P+&amp;P       P (P+&amp;P)&#13;
wuhere L  labor force&#13;
D   demand for the product&#13;
X = exports&#13;
M = imports&#13;
P = labor productivity (i.e. output per man)&#13;
The first term on the ROHoS. represents the effect of demand expansion,&#13;
the second the effect of exports, the third the effect of imports and the&#13;
last the effect of productivity change. In our example the L.H.S. is - 35&#13;
percent, the demand term is 30 percent,, the export term is zero, the import&#13;
term is -40 percent, and the productivity term is - 25 percent.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 87 -&#13;
In turning from the number displaced to the costs thereby created we&#13;
have moved from reasonably well-estimate.d figures to the speculative. Our last&#13;
issue is the impact on relative wages and for this we have no figures at all.&#13;
It has already been noted that the effect of trade with developing countries is&#13;
.to lower the demand for relatively unskilled labor, ceteris paribus. We are&#13;
also informed by Bale (1976) that trade-displaced workers experienced a fall in&#13;
wages, at least initially, although Jacobson (1978) implies the opposite for male&#13;
workers in industries most likely to be affected by imports from developing&#13;
countries. Sinclair (1978, (B)), while noting the general finding that people&#13;
move to higher paid jobs, indicates that case studies in the United Kingdom have&#13;
shown the opposite, especially when the initial impact is on such relatively well-&#13;
paid industries as coal-mining and steel. Does this mean that liberal trade with&#13;
developing countries would reduce the relative wage of unskilled labor, a la&#13;
Stolper Samuelson, or that, failing such a reduction, unemployment would in-&#13;
exorably rise?&#13;
Growth in the exports of developing countries envisaged for the next&#13;
decade or so could not possibly have a significant general effect on the labor&#13;
market. If one takes Wolter's estimate of the gross labor displacement by&#13;
imports in Germany at 800,000 between 1973 and 1985, and the assumed rise in&#13;
employment in exports to developing countries at 400,000, and applies Schumacher's&#13;
(1978) information on the composition of the direct and indirect employment created&#13;
by the two, the net decline in demand for people with no vocational training is&#13;
about 200,000 in West Germany. Balassa (1979) estimates the net fall in the demand&#13;
for unskilled labor in OECD countries between 1976 and 1986 at about 200,000&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 88&#13;
overall, which is less than 0.3 percent of the total labor force in manufactur-&#13;
ing. Given the scale of migrant labor in these countries, such a reduction&#13;
would surely not have any significant effect on relative wages.&#13;
In the very long term,liberal policies in developed countries com-&#13;
bined with an export orientation in the developing could presumably have a&#13;
significant effect on production structures and factor prices in the former. If&#13;
one considers the impact made by only very few developing countries in such&#13;
industries as textiles and clothing, the size of the labor force available in&#13;
countries such as India and elsewhere in Asia, and the existing gap in the wages of&#13;
unskilled labor between developed and developing countries, it seems likely that&#13;
competitive pressure could become intense. There is evidently something somewhat&#13;
incongruous about the incomes enjoyed by unskilled (and semi-skilled) labor in&#13;
developed countries, given the fact that the world suffers not from scarcity of&#13;
such labor, but from abundance. As Lewis (1977) notes "The working classes&#13;
(in developed countries) were always adamant against Indian or Chinese immigration&#13;
into their countries because they realized that, if unchecked, it would drive&#13;
wages down close to Indian or Chinese levels". However, free trade tends to&#13;
have the same effect in the long run. During a sustained boom immigration and&#13;
the import of goods could be seen as-a means of releasing domestic labor from&#13;
unpleasant activities. However, in a recession the fear of 'pauper labor' comes&#13;
again to the fore. The recent growth in protectionist sentiment may be seen as&#13;
a warning shot indicating that some growth of trade will be permitted, but that&#13;
there is fear of what a liberal world might bring and determination to see that&#13;
what is feared does not occur.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 89 -&#13;
Is the fear correct? The answer depends on how easy it is to&#13;
transform unskilled labor in industrialized countries into highly skilled&#13;
labor. In theory, the many years of education enjoyed by everyone in developed&#13;
countries should mean that workers are over-qualified for the jobs in which&#13;
developing countries are competitive. In practice, it is not so clear that a&#13;
significant amount of valuable human capital is embodied in the unskilled&#13;
labor forces of the developed countries. Another factor will be the intensity&#13;
in unskilled labor of services, which are likely to be the fastest growing&#13;
activities. There is also the possibility of transfers from those who benefit&#13;
from the trade with developing countries to those who lose. This last makes&#13;
it clear that compensation may have to go well beyond short run costs if&#13;
organized labor is to tolerate the apparent implications of liberal trade with&#13;
developing countries.&#13;
What can we conclude? In the past the exports of developing countries&#13;
have had a very small effect on employment in the developed countries: even&#13;
in the most exposed industries productivity growth has been much more important.&#13;
It is disturbing how strong the protectionist reaction has been in this context.&#13;
In the fairly near future, the exports of the developing countries, while much&#13;
more significant - perhaps decisive in a few industries, will continue to be&#13;
much less important than productivity growth as a source of job displacement.&#13;
Moreover, there seems every likelihood that most of the job displacement can&#13;
occur through natural wastage. Thus, figures for the cost of unemployment&#13;
which assume that all those theoretically displaced are actual victims of lay-&#13;
offs are gross overestimates. Over the reasonably short run the impact on&#13;
the composition of the demand for labor will be quite minor. In the much longer&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 90 &#13;
term free trade with developing countries could have a significant effect on&#13;
unskilled labor in developed countries. In order to avoid harmful social&#13;
repercussions, it will be essential for the developed countries to ensure&#13;
that a high level of capital is "embodied" in new entrants into the labor force.&#13;
b. iii. Regions&#13;
It is frequently argued that a major reason for the high costs&#13;
created by the exports of developing countries is that their impact is regionally&#13;
concentrated. Furthermore, it is the poorest regions that are worst affected.&#13;
Since an even distribution of activity across regions is desired by many&#13;
developed countries this impact becomes a major source of protectionist pressure.&#13;
What is the evidence? It should be noted that there are essentially two&#13;
distinct questions. Firstly,"Does the overall impact of exports from developing&#13;
countries tend to be regionally concentrated and especially on the poorer regions?"&#13;
Secondly1, "Are any of the major affected industries regionally concentrated?"&#13;
The first is more important from the welfare point of view, but the second has&#13;
political implications.&#13;
Wolter (19771, Table 6) indicates that the revealed comparative&#13;
advantage of Germany vis-a-vis the developing countries is negatively correlated&#13;
with the employment structure of poorer regions. Dicke, Glisman, Horn and Neu&#13;
(1976, pp. 214=5) provides estimatea of the impact at the district level (i.e.&#13;
Regierungsbezirke, Verwaltungsbezirke, Kreisfreie St'adte, or Landkreise) of&#13;
continued liberalization of imports from developing countries of textiles and&#13;
clothing, precisaon and optical instruments, leather manufactures and footwear.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 91 -&#13;
They show than in certain cases the 1972-85 employment reduction is over 20&#13;
percent of 1970 employment in manufacturing, while in others it is virtually&#13;
zero. For France the Commissariat General du Plan (1978, Annexe VIII) indicates&#13;
that the proportion of total industrial employment in sensitive industries&#13;
varies widely by district. In some cases the share is as high as 50 percent.&#13;
Furthermore, in vulnerable districts there is a strong tendency for the share&#13;
in employment of one sensitive industry to be very high. As an extreme case&#13;
32 percent of industrial workers in the Dordogne are engaged in the manufacture&#13;
of footwear. Cable's study of some sensitive industries in the United Kingdom&#13;
does not focus upon the regions, but he indicates that none of the industries&#13;
is highly concentrated in broad-regions of high unemployment, except for textiles.&#13;
Moreover, the Lancashire textile towns do not suffer from high unemployment.&#13;
(Cable 1977, Table 4 and pp. 41-3).&#13;
What of the regional concentration of industries? Glisman and Fels&#13;
(1975, Table A2) indicate that footwear, leather and leather product industries&#13;
are more regionally concentrated than average in West Germany, but textiles are&#13;
much less so. In the United Kingdom the textiles industry is regionally con-&#13;
centrated, however. Information is needed on the situation of affected industries&#13;
in other major developed countries.&#13;
b. iv. Conclusion&#13;
One key point needs to be emphasized. Whether one looks at the&#13;
problem from the point of view of industries and firms, or of workers, or of&#13;
regions it appears that these exports bear most heavily on marginal actors.&#13;
An undynamic firm in a stagnant industry, an unskilled worker or women, a back-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -&#13;
ward region - these are the victims of exports from developing countries.&#13;
In effect, marginal actors in the domestic context of the developed countries&#13;
are under attack from those who in a global sense are still more marginal,&#13;
namely, the new firms and impoverished workers of the developing countries.&#13;
Of course, overall the increased availability of cheaper clothes and shoes&#13;
benefits the same sort of people as those who are hurt, but the former never&#13;
have the same political influence. The essential problem for an adjustment policy&#13;
designed to increase the market access of developing countries is how to combine&#13;
this with the strong desire of developed countries to improve the relative&#13;
incomes of poorer groups of workers and to promote the development of poorer&#13;
regions.&#13;
c.    Political Aspects of the Reaction to Imports from Developing Countries&#13;
c. i.     Whose "voice" - capital, labor, or industries?&#13;
When one examines the overall effective protective structure of the&#13;
developed countries, with the bias against exports from developing countries of&#13;
raw materialzand labor-intensive products, there can be little doubt that the&#13;
'conservative social welfare function' is at work. At least as far as trade&#13;
with developing countries is concerned, the reaction is defensive - the support of&#13;
senescent industry. Who or what is being conserved?&#13;
TOe evidence of the bias against imports of labor-intensive products&#13;
presented above can be supplemented by such analyses as those of Ball (1967) and&#13;
Anderson (1978), for the JUnited States of America and Australia, respectively.&#13;
Ball argues that it is the industries intensive in unskilled labor that are&#13;
most heavily protected:   ".... the 1962 U.S. tariff afforded heavier effective&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -&#13;
protection to lower-wage industries, and lesser effective protection to higher-&#13;
wage industries" - (Ibid., p.186). It is possible to explain this bias as-&#13;
reflecting the general fear of the effects on unskilled labor of,unrestricted&#13;
trade with developing countries. The relevant economic model would be one that&#13;
assumes perfect mobility of factors of production, and the political implication&#13;
would be resistance by the owners of the factor used intensively in the industries&#13;
suffering from a comparative disadvantage. Thus, the major political force&#13;
would be the lobbying of organized labor. This is indeed likely to be one cause&#13;
of the sort of protectionist policies that are observed: organized labor is&#13;
frequently protectionist, and the number of those affected, their importance as&#13;
electors, and the generally accepted egalitarian desire to narrow the gap between&#13;
the incomes of unskilled labor and those elsewhere, will all add to their pressure.&#13;
Nonetheless, while this may indeed be a part of the story, it is certainly not&#13;
all of it.&#13;
The evidence of protection to unskilled labor-intensive industries&#13;
admits of quite a different explanation. Since these are the industries suffer-&#13;
ing from the strongest competitive pressure, an alternative hypothesis would be&#13;
that it is the owners of the industry-specific fixed factors that are the&#13;
main source of protectionist lobbying. It-may be argued tnat unskilled labor&#13;
can readily obtain work elsewhere and the general effect on the wage is too&#13;
remote (and speculative) to lead to much protectionist pressure. (Indeed, it&#13;
is almost as remote and generalized as the interest of consumers in liberalized&#13;
trade). However, the owners of such industry-specific factors as physical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -&#13;
and human capital not only have a great deal to lose in the short-to-medium-&#13;
runi, but often have ready-made organizations to represent them. Indeed, there&#13;
is considerable evidence that it is the industry associations, representing&#13;
physical capital and management, combined with unions, when they represent&#13;
workers who have a great deal to lose (as in the car or steel industries) (Jacobson&#13;
1978), that are decisive. Magee (n.d.) argues that the evidence for the United&#13;
States indicates that in almost all cases labor and capital in a given industry&#13;
agree either on protection or on free trade as the most desirable course, which&#13;
supports the fixed-factor model of lobbying pressure.&#13;
There is also some evidence that of those representing fixed factors&#13;
in industries currently most vulnerable to competition from developing countries,&#13;
it is the industry associations that are the most important (even if thev relv&#13;
on the employment argument.&#13;
One point is that much of the protection received by threatened&#13;
industry is not through the general tariff, but through emergency product-specific&#13;
intervention of a "safeguard@' nature. Sinclair provides very interesting direct&#13;
evidence (1978, (A), (B), and (C)) that in the footwear, cutlery and radio&#13;
industries of the United Kingdom it has been the industry associations that have&#13;
pushed hardest for such non-tariff protection.&#13;
There is also indirect evidence to support the importance of the&#13;
industry associations. Many of the workers are women or (in the case of textiles&#13;
in Germany and the United Kingdom) immigrants. They are poorly organized and&#13;
certainly lack substantial political influence (Cable, 1977, p.45). Furthermore,&#13;
there is evidence that the most protected industries have experienced extremely&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -&#13;
high-labor turn-over and continued labor shortages, at least in the boom years&#13;
of the sixties and early seventies. Thus, the Tripartite Report (1973, p.10)&#13;
says "Despite the repeated claim that import quotas are necessary to protect&#13;
employment, all of our textile industries have labor shortages". Another piece&#13;
of evidence for the importance of the firms and their owners is the protection&#13;
granted to raw-material intensive industry through cascading tariffs. These&#13;
industries employ few people, which is why they tend to be ignored when the&#13;
employment impact of the exports of developing countries is examined. Part of&#13;
the reason for the protection is presumably the government's desire to protect&#13;
industrial activity as such. However, it is likely that the owners of industrial&#13;
capital are an important factor, and certainly no reason to suppose that it is&#13;
labor interests that matter. Evidence that governments respond to private lobbies&#13;
and that firms are a key part of the latter is also supplied by the lack of&#13;
protection of industries or activities when major firms have a strong interest&#13;
in imports from developing countries. One need only consider the case of&#13;
electronics and the continued existence in a number of tariff codes of special&#13;
provisions for off-shore assembly, despite their unpopularity with organized&#13;
labor.&#13;
What is the role of governments? Obviously, decisions to protect&#13;
are made by governments, but this does not mean that they are initiators. It&#13;
is true that they may have general protectionist prejudices, especially vis-a-vis&#13;
the developing countries; they may see no link between exports to, and imports&#13;
from, developing countries; they may fear that factor market rigidities mean a&#13;
permanent loss of output from factors engaged in import competing activity&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 96 -&#13;
following liberalization; and they may even be concerned about the short-run&#13;
social costs of adjustment. However, in every specific case they seem to be&#13;
responding to the pressures of those who are suffering the private cost. Govern-&#13;
ments have therefore been largely a passive factor, whose role it has been to&#13;
shift costs imposed on identifiable domestic groups by identifiable and powerless&#13;
foreigners onto the rest of the population.&#13;
c. ii. Sources of lobbying strength&#13;
Is the regional impact important for the strength of a protectionist&#13;
lobby? It must be remembered that protectionist pressure originates with an&#13;
industry. The regional interest is a supporting one, at most. However, if the&#13;
industry is important to one or more specific areas, it can rely on such support.&#13;
If an industry is small in the national context, it will probably help its bid&#13;
for protection to be concentrated in politically marginal regions. Thus, the&#13;
regional concentration of leather products and shoes in Germany and the United&#13;
States and, apparently, of a wider range of 'sensitive' products in France may&#13;
help to mobilize local support for protection. If an industry is large, especially&#13;
in terms of employment, concentration may not matter at all. Thus, if it is con-&#13;
centrated an industry will be decisive in a few areas; if it is not, it will be notice-&#13;
able in many. Which of these is politically more valuable will depend in part on&#13;
the political system. If legislators have independence, as in the United States,&#13;
a relatively widely-dispersed but noticeable industry may have an enormous lobby.&#13;
(Pinius 1975). If politics is dominated by party organizations concerned about&#13;
winning marginal seats, industries that are concentrated in the latter areas may&#13;
be the most politically powerful.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 97 -&#13;
Because of the problem of organizing "free riders", it may be expected&#13;
that the level of assistance will be negatively related to the number of firms&#13;
in the industry, and this is Anderson's (1978) finding for Australia. However,&#13;
to his surprise but in accordance with evidence for the United States of America&#13;
and Canada, the level of assistance is also negatively related to the concentration&#13;
of the industry's output in the largest four firms. The explanation may be that an&#13;
industry can be concentrated, but have relatively many firms, only if the size&#13;
distribution of firms within the industry is extremely unequal. In that case,&#13;
as we have suggested, there may be conflicts of interest within the industry with&#13;
larger firms expecting to benefit from imports, as has happened in the electronics&#13;
industries of some countries. Anderson also reports, very surprisingly, that&#13;
numbers employed are not a significant factor; this conflicts with other findings&#13;
(Cheh 1974).&#13;
The ability to organize and the existence 'of strong common interests&#13;
seem to be the decisive factors. Industries most likely to show these characteristics&#13;
are those with relatively few firms, based entirely in one country, producing&#13;
standardized items with an easily accessible technology, and vulnerable to com-&#13;
petition both from developing and developed countries. Political receptivity&#13;
is likely to be enhanced if a national security interest can be identified, if&#13;
the firms are closely identified with the state (perhaps through nationalization),&#13;
and if the numbers employed in individual plants are very large (which may. matter&#13;
more than the total number employed). Steel and, to a lesser extent,ship-building,&#13;
show all these characteristics. The additional fact that their work forces tend&#13;
to be relatively well paid will be a powerful impetus to trade union pressure.&#13;
Kay and Hanna (1977) remark:"When 500 jobs are lost in each of 50 firms, a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 98 -&#13;
government finds it relatively easy to resist pressure to act; but when 25,000&#13;
jobs are at risk in a single enterprise, the pressures are of a different order&#13;
of magnitude". Thus, the industries now most vulnerable to imports from develop-&#13;
ing countries may not be as effective as lobbyists as those that are to come.&#13;
The success of the textile lobby may seem somewhat surprising, since&#13;
over the entire range of processes the number of firms is extremely large, the&#13;
differences in size considerable, the size of plant generally modest, and the&#13;
strategic significance not very great. In the case of the pressures leading&#13;
up to the last renegotiation of the MFA, especially in Europe, a particularly&#13;
important factor appears to have been the decision of the large fibre producers&#13;
that their interests lay with the survival of the textile and clothing industries&#13;
downstream. They could, therefore, become the core of the organizational effort,&#13;
using the natural but generally ineffective appeal of the numerous small firms&#13;
and multitude of employees as valuable points of political persuasion.&#13;
c. iiM. Assessment of the political factors&#13;
It is clear that the core of the adjustment problem is political re-&#13;
sistance. What have we learned about the political realities and, therefore,&#13;
about the political effect that adjustment policy must have? In the first&#13;
place, protection against developing countries is seen as politically costless,&#13;
except in those few cases when powerful producer interests are ranged on the&#13;
other side. Ne'.ther consumers nor advocates of development are a significant&#13;
lobby and the fear of effective retaliation by developing countries is small.&#13;
In the second place, there is quite general suspicion of developing countries'&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-99 -&#13;
long-term impact: they are feared not only for their competitiveness in-&#13;
existing lines of production, but for their expected expansion into a host&#13;
of new ones. In the third place, developing countries' exports are seen as&#13;
having a damaging effect on vulnerable firms, workers and regions and thus&#13;
as being especially "unfair". For these reasons, the resistance of protection-&#13;
ist pressure is exceptionally weak in this case. If we turn to the lobbies&#13;
themselves, we notice that, with the possible exception of textiles (and now&#13;
steel, of course), the industries are not really particularly powerful, although&#13;
their regional concentration may help their lobbying efforts. Moreover, the&#13;
main driving force behind protection is neither workers nor regions but the&#13;
industry associations. Consequently, the owners of firms will have to be com-&#13;
pensated if protectionist pressure is to be abated. It can also be argued&#13;
that the fact that, for many firms, import restriction is a life-or-death matter&#13;
may be the main cause of lobbying intensity. Finally, if the older lobbies&#13;
were not intrinsically very strong, this certainly does not apply to some of&#13;
the newly affected industries, like steel or ship-building with automobiles to&#13;
come. Nonetheless, while impossible to prove, it seems plausible that the&#13;
protectionist bias against the developing countries is not caused by the strength&#13;
of the "voice" in favor, but by the complete lack of an effective "voice",&#13;
against.&#13;
D. The Goals Of Adjustment Policy&#13;
If the problem of adjustment to imports from developing countries&#13;
is examined in economic terms, it is difficult to understand the fuss. Consider&#13;
that in a number of developed countries the fall in the labor force engaged&#13;
in agriculture was close to 50 percent over a fifteen year period, that both&#13;
the United States and a number of European countries have absorbed millions of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 100 -&#13;
foreign workers, that in the U.S.A, "in manufacturing almost 11 million job&#13;
changes and new hires occurred in a recent year" (Mintz 1973, p.5) and that&#13;
in the United Kingdom "some 400,000 people change jobs every month" (Price&#13;
1978, p.87). Against these figures, a gross displacement of 3 percent of the&#13;
labor force in manufacturing over a decade, most of which will be taken care&#13;
of by natural wastage, hardly looks very troublesome. This remains true, even&#13;
if some industries were to perish. It would certainly not be the first time&#13;
that has happened.&#13;
However, the problem is essentially not economic but political and&#13;
derives from the fact that the protectionist instrument is ready to hand and&#13;
that there is negligible political pressure against its use, at least where&#13;
developing countries are concerned. The initiating force is usually the burden&#13;
of private costs and the knowledge that governments can be persuaded to shift&#13;
these burdens elsewhere, usually in such a way that, however real, they are&#13;
largely invisible.&#13;
If the problem is political, an adjustment policy must be judged in&#13;
large measure by its political effects. However, no adjustment policy can remove&#13;
all political pressures and fears: it cannot make the imposition of protection&#13;
politically expensive - that takes retaliation; it cannot persuade governments&#13;
that protection is inefficient - that takes education; it cannot change the&#13;
nature of the developing countries' impact on vulnerable groups; it cannot make&#13;
producers in developed countries see the developing countries as a help not a&#13;
hindrance; it cannot compensate fully every victim of change, nor can it transform&#13;
the process of development into one without cost; finally, it cannot mitigate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 101 -&#13;
the forces of. nationalism. About some of these problems the developing countries&#13;
themselves may be able to do something and a clear perception of the political&#13;
process in the developed will help them. However, there are some problems that&#13;
cannot be cured. All the adjustment policy can do is to reduce.the real social&#13;
costs of the adjustment period and - most important - alleviate and reduce the&#13;
private costs that are the source of the pressure.&#13;
What are thought to be appropriate adjustment policies depend on the&#13;
view taken of the desirable framework for policy making in the developed countries.&#13;
One view is that the problem of adjustment is one of political will, and that&#13;
governments must be cajoled and pressured, partly from abroad, to abstain from&#13;
protectionism, while allowing the market to handle the process of adjustment.&#13;
This position might be stretched somewhat to grant that, whatever the merits&#13;
of the market and however great the likelihood that government intervention&#13;
will make things worse, compensation of those affected (or apparently affected)&#13;
by import competition is necessary if the market is to be allowed to work. Com-&#13;
pensation certainly seems to be politically the most direct way of achieving&#13;
adjustment. Another view is that the market is indeed the best way to re-&#13;
allocate resources, but that not only compensation, but measures to increase its&#13;
efficiency,are required. Various kinds of externalities can justify the&#13;
subsidization of training, for example, while there may be a need to remove&#13;
a host of obstacles to mobility. It may also be efficient to subsidize the&#13;
movement of firms to regions, and useful to help with the anticipation of change&#13;
through the provision of information. Such policies may be thought of as re-&#13;
ducing the social costs of change either by directly tackling market imperfections&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 102 -&#13;
or by providing subsidies to offset their effects. The policy of "safeguard"&#13;
protection to industry may be another way to reduce social costs,this time by&#13;
slowing down the pace of change. Still another viewpoint stresses the failures&#13;
of the decision-making mechanism itself, and suggests that governments must&#13;
become directly involved in what firms do through plans to "restructure"&#13;
senescent industry or promote the purported winners of the future. It is these&#13;
various specific alternatives to long term protection and their actual effective-&#13;
ness that are considered in the succeeding chapter. Throughout the emphasis will&#13;
be on what might be politically effective.&#13;
It must be remembered that we are attempting to remove the bias against&#13;
developing countries in an unfavorable macroeconomic context. Since many of the&#13;
policies to be discussed are general in effect, they will help all adjustment.&#13;
This is valuable even if a bias against imports remains. However, some of the&#13;
policies (compensation, for example) can be made trade-specific. In such cases&#13;
we must consider whether the advantages of programs with a pro-trade bias, or&#13;
even with a bias in favor of trade with developing countries, outweigh the dis-&#13;
advantages of special treatment of this kind.&#13;

IV. AN EVALUATION OF EXISTING POLICIES&#13;
What policies have been tried? How well have they worked? How do&#13;
they fit into the economic and social context of the various countries? These are&#13;
the questions to be considered immediately below. However, in order to avoid&#13;
overloading the discussion with excessive detail, we will focus on&#13;
just a few examples in each case. First of all, however, the problem of adjustment&#13;
policy will be looked at from the point of view of the various countries.&#13;
A. The Country Situations&#13;
a. Essential Distinctions&#13;
In a recent paper on adjustment policy Giersch (1978) proposes as&#13;
a key distinction that between "Schumpeterian" and "Keynesian" countries. The for-&#13;
mer are, broadly speaking, those which emphasize the dynamic power of the market&#13;
economy, who rely on supply rather than demand as the agent of growth, and whose&#13;
"economists and other intellectuals still praise the virtues of openness vis a vis&#13;
the future (indeterminacy) and the rest of the world" (Ibid., p.5). The latter&#13;
stress the demand aspects of growth, tend to favor government policies over private&#13;
initiative, tend to be sensitive to a strong popular quest for private security&#13;
and interpersonal equality, and emphasize the short run over the long run. It&#13;
is Giersch's hypothesis that this interesting (and not implausible) distinction&#13;
allows us to identify the outward looking countries of the Third World as the&#13;
"natural partners of advanced Schumpeterian countries" (Ibid., p.6).&#13;
If Giersch is right, one very simple way of approaching the adjust-&#13;
ment problem, conceived in relation to the goal of increasing the ease of access&#13;
of the exports-of the developing countries to the markets of the developed, is to&#13;
identify the "Schumpeterian" countries and consider ways of arranging a bargain&#13;
between them and the outward looking developing countries. However, while Giersch&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 104 -&#13;
has pointed to an important distinction, which will have bearing on the sort of&#13;
adjustment policy that is appropriate in certain contexts, there is a far from&#13;
perfect correlation between the Schumpeterian countries and the non-protectionist,&#13;
on the one hand, and the Keynesian countries and the protectionist, on the other&#13;
hand. This follows naturally from the point we emphasized above, namely, that&#13;
trade with developing countries is a special case and is treated with special&#13;
discrimination. Thus, the overall attitude to adjustment and change, which is at&#13;
the heart of the distinction Giersch wishes to make, does not determine the atti-&#13;
tude to trade with developing countries.&#13;
If one considers the attitude of the United States to foreign trade&#13;
from the Civil War to the end of the nineteenth century or that of Germany from&#13;
1879 to 1914, one sees two perfect examples of "Schumpeterian" protectionist&#13;
economies. There is obviously no incompatibility between economic dynamism, (even&#13;
when market-reliant), and protectionist attitudes. Nationalism, unwillingness to&#13;
accept the legitimacy of competition from those enjoying different factor costs,&#13;
the power of producer lobbies, or some other factor may explain this apparent&#13;
contradiction.   Even now it is clear from the statistics that the United Kingdom,&#13;
surely the archetypal "Keynesian" economy, is no more protectionist vis a vis the&#13;
developing countries than such "Schumpeterian" economies as Germany, the United&#13;
States or Japan./1&#13;
/1 In 1973 the manufactured imports of the U.K. from developing countries at $1,525.4&#13;
million were equal to those of Germany at $1,562.5 million and almost thrice&#13;
those of France at $591.5 million. If one compares these imports with GNP, (which&#13;
avoids the down7jard bias of comparing imports from developing countries with total&#13;
imports for the European countries which trade so much among themselves), the&#13;
order is as follnOMS among the five largest developed countries in 1973: United&#13;
Kingdom (0.84%), E7ni_ed States (0.55%), Japan (0.52%), West Germany (0.44%) and&#13;
France (0.24%). It is true that the import growth in the United Kingdon is relatively&#13;
low, while that in Japan is high, but this can be explained in part by the&#13;
relatively slow GNP growth of the former. It is also true that the United Kingdom&#13;
has historically had a close connection with a few important developing countries,&#13;
such as Hong Kong and India. Nonetheless, it is clear that there is no simple&#13;
relationship between economic dynamism and reliance on the market, on the one&#13;
hand, and openness to imports from developing countries, on the other. (Data&#13;
come from Keesing 1976, Table 1 and World Bank 1976, Annex .)&#13;

The actual treatment of developing countries is the result of two forces, the&#13;
first of which is the overall openness to market-induced change and the second&#13;
of which is the bias against change brought about specifically by trade, in general,&#13;
or with     developing countries, in particular.   It is possible for a country to&#13;
be hostile to almost all change but not to be particularly biased against any&#13;
particular source of change, and vice versa. It is for this reason that even&#13;
"Schumpeterian" countries may need special adjustment policies to make trade with&#13;
developing countries more acceptable.&#13;
Even if the distinction between "Schumpeterian" and "Keynesian"&#13;
countries neither ,itself indicates who will be protectionist nor allows us to&#13;
identify with confidence the countries that can easily be persuaded to cooperate&#13;
with developing countries, it does serve a valuable purpose. This is to separate&#13;
those countries for which the main aim of adjustment policy is to remove the&#13;
bias against developing countries and allow the market to operate, from those&#13;
which are already highly-interventionist. In the latter case one must work&#13;
within the context of policies designed directly to affect the structure of&#13;
industry. Adjustment policy must be framed,.given that situation, with the aim&#13;
of shifting to forward-looking from defensive intervention. Thus, we do not&#13;
suppose that there is any special likelihood that "Schumpeterian" economies will&#13;
be less biased against developing countries, nor do we abandon all hope of the&#13;
"Keynesian" countries.  What we recognize is that the sorts of policies that are&#13;
likely to be acceptable and indeed to work vill differ greatly between the two.&#13;
In the above we have made the assumption that "Schumpeterian"&#13;
economies are market-oriented while "Keynesian" countries are interventionist.&#13;
This is not necessarily correct. A second distinction needs to be made between for-&#13;
ward-looking interventionist countries (for example, Japan and France) and defensive&#13;
interventionist countries (for example, the United Kingdom and Italy). In the&#13;
former case, it will be important to ensure that-intervention takes into account&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 106 -&#13;
the adjustment to trade with developing countries; however, in the latter a change&#13;
in the orientation of policy may be required as well.&#13;
Apart from distinctions between market-oriented and interventionist&#13;
countries and between forward-looking and defensive interventionists, there are&#13;
two other important distinctions to be made from the point of view both of under-&#13;
standing existing policy and of recommending change. In the first place, the need&#13;
for special policies to provide extra compensation or income security depends on&#13;
the extent of development of the welfare state. The more developed it is, the&#13;
less the role of such special policies. In the second place, the role of any&#13;
trade-related program depends on the magnitude of the impact of trade on the economy,&#13;
or in other words the openness of the economy, and on the extent of political bias&#13;
against change brought about by trade, in general, or trade with developing countries,&#13;
in particular. Thus, the larger the impact of trade the more infeasible it becomes&#13;
to separate trade-induced from other change, and the less the bias against trade-&#13;
induced change the less valuable trade-specific programs become.&#13;
In sum, for the purposes of analysing existing policy in its country&#13;
context and of recommending changes - a subject discussed in the next chapter -&#13;
the following questions seem relevant: Is the country generally market-oriented&#13;
or interventionist? Is the interventionism forward-looking or defensive? Does&#13;
there already exist a comprehensive and generous welfare state? Is trade a large&#13;
part of economic life, so that a separate trade-related program could make sense&#13;
only if directed at trade with a specific group of countries (for example, developing&#13;
countries)? Is there significantly greater resistance to trade-induced change than&#13;
to any other change? The reader should have these questions firmly in mind during&#13;
the succeeding discussion.&#13;
b. The United States of America&#13;
A number of features of the United States explain the&#13;
particular policies it has adopted in the domestic sphere to complement liberal&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 107 -&#13;
trade policies: in the firs$t-pjace, there is a strong commitment to the idea of&#13;
the market. It is accepted that the main responsibility both for creating and re-&#13;
acting to economic change lies with private firms. Direct government interference&#13;
in the decision-making process is regarded with considerable suspicion, at least&#13;
outside the ranks of firms dependent on public defence and aerospace expenditures.L/2&#13;
In the second place, the Federal Government shares responsibility for domestic&#13;
micro-economic policies with State and local government. Indeed, most of what&#13;
would in other countries be regional policy determined by the central government&#13;
is in the United States the responsibility of State or local governments. However,&#13;
the Federal Government has unquestioned authority over trade policy. In the&#13;
third place, the welfare state system, while enormously developed over the last&#13;
forty-five years, remains less generous than those of most European countries.&#13;
Thus, the risks of a free economy are "socialized" to a relatively small extent,&#13;
and the loss of a Job, in particular, means a significant fall in income. Fourthly,&#13;
and most directly relevant, the commitment to the market is not, and never has&#13;
been, conterminous with a commitment to free trade. On the contrary, with the&#13;
exception of relatively brief periods, dominant sentiment and national policy&#13;
has been protectionist. Finally, trade is quite a small component of GNP (about&#13;
7 percent - and this exaggerates since GNP is value added while imports are sales),&#13;
and, furthermore, the number of industries for which it is a decisive factor is&#13;
modest.&#13;
/2   One of the reasons for the liking for protection by firms in the United States&#13;
is that it provides a large subsidy with absolutely no government interference.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 108 -&#13;
This combination explains why the trade assistance programs of the&#13;
United States are thought desirable and feasible. A Federal Government committed&#13;
to liberal trade, but faced wiEh strong protectionist pressure,wants to provide&#13;
compensation to those affected, largely in order to reduce political resistance&#13;
and to make trade-induced change less "unfair". The Government has neither the&#13;
authority nor the ability to restructure industries as it wishes, but it can pro-&#13;
vide assistance to those who see themselves as directly hurt by imports. The&#13;
absence of a generous welfare state system makes it possible to provide higher&#13;
levels of unemployment pay to workers (the heart of the program) without exceed-&#13;
ing existing levels of pay in the affected industry or what workers might obtain&#13;
elsewhere. The modest impact of trade and its concentration on a few industries&#13;
help to allow the trade adjustment assistance program to operate in a marginal&#13;
way. Finally, recognition of the role of firms as a source of lobbying pressure&#13;
and knowledge that only a limited number will ever be overwhelmingly affected&#13;
by imports explains the addition to the program of assistance to firms. In sum,&#13;
trade adjustment assistance is an appropriate response to American circumstances.&#13;
It is a major question whether the same applies elsewhere. The role of the policy&#13;
is to allow the market to work as effectively as it does in other contexts in the&#13;
American economy, largely by mollifying the political opposition and providing&#13;
the Federal Government with an alternative to protection.&#13;
c. The European Economic Community&#13;
Obviously, the countries of the current, expanded (and rapidly&#13;
expanding) European Economic Community are an heterogeneous group, varying in their&#13;
attitude to the market, degree and kind of interventionism, development of the&#13;
welfare state, and the role of, and attitude towards, trade. Nonetheless, there&#13;
are certain common features which differentiate them from the United States, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 109 -&#13;
are relevant to the adjustment policies they have adopted: firstly, trade is&#13;
very important indeed, the ratio of exports to GNP varying from about 20 percent&#13;
in the case of France to about 50 percent in the case of Belgium and the Netherlands.&#13;
While these numbers do, of course, exaggerate the true ratio, since value added in&#13;
exports is much less than gross value, especially in the smaller economies, the&#13;
contrast with the United States is striking. Secondly, most of the countries have&#13;
extremely well-developed welfare states: to take just one example, the propor-&#13;
tion of earnings received as unemployment compensation in France or Germany is&#13;
higher than workers in the United States receive even after the topping up&#13;
provided by trade adjustment assistance. Thirdly, political sensitivity to un-&#13;
employment is high. The United States has consistently run higher rates of un-&#13;
employment than those in Europe. (This is true even allowing for differences in&#13;
underlying concepts, as OECD (1978, Diagram 2) shows clearly.) Finally, most&#13;
of the governments have taken a major and growing responsibility for economic&#13;
development, and have adopted a wide range of tools for selective and discre-&#13;
tionary intervention. That this is so is clearly documented for France and the&#13;
United Kingdom (Shonfield 1965; Corden and Fels 1976; Price 1978). However,&#13;
even in the case of Germany, there is close cooperation between government and&#13;
business (Shonfield 1965, Chapter XII; Price 1978, pp. 8-16). There are important&#13;
differences in the form of intervention (discretionary or automatic, selective or&#13;
general), and in the aims (forward-looking or defensive), but there is no disagree-&#13;
ment about the government's ultimate reqponsibility to intervene.&#13;
To these features of the individual countries must be added the&#13;
implications of the existence of the European Economic Community and the commit-&#13;
ment to economic integration: perhaps the most important is the decision to&#13;
treat those trade-induced changes that occur within the Community essentially as&#13;
if they occur within the boundaries of a nation state. Thus, the commitment to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 110 -&#13;
liberalization is thought to be irrevocable. Furthermore, with the exception of&#13;
the rather modest assistance given by the Social Fund and the European Coal and&#13;
Steel Community (Braun 1973, pp.203-4),adjustment is supposed to occur within the&#13;
framework of normal national policy for dealing with dislocation, whether trade-&#13;
related or not. Another important implication of the existence of the EEC is that&#13;
trade policy is a Community matter. Thus, individual countries have been forced&#13;
to use other measures to protect senescent or promote infant industry, and to&#13;
develop backward regions. This, in turn, has created room for dispute among the&#13;
countries who have argued that such measures as the United Kingdom's Temporary&#13;
Employment Subsidy, or the subsidization of steel plants and ship-building in a&#13;
number of countries, are protectionism carried out by other means.-3&#13;
The combination of national policies and attitudes, on the one hand,&#13;
and international imperatives, on the other hand, has direct implications for the&#13;
appropriateness of trade adjustment assistance on the United States model. At the&#13;
national level, governments already possess in the welfare state apparatus and&#13;
industrial and regional policies virtually all the instruments they might require&#13;
to make adjustment more acceptable and less costly. Furthermore, the importance&#13;
of trade to their national economies, and especially to the industrial sector,&#13;
makes it quite impossible to separate trade-induced from other changes. It is&#13;
difficult to think of any firm or industry whose difficulties do not have an&#13;
important trade-related component. Moreover, the commitment to the European&#13;
Economic Community determines both the sort of adjustment policies to be used for&#13;
/3   The potential for dispute is increased by the fact that, not only is trade&#13;
policy Lne responsibility of the Community, but policy towards industry within&#13;
each country comes under the guidance of rules favoring free and equal com-&#13;
petition. The EEC itself has an important commitment in the Rome Treaty to&#13;
the idea of competition in a free market, which has, for example, constrained&#13;
resort to cartelization in the recent recession.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ll -&#13;
intra-European trade and the fact that no distinction between intra-European and&#13;
intra-national trade may be made. Thus, the individual countries would find an&#13;
overall trade adjustment program neither feasible, nor politically appropriate.&#13;
Of course, this does not mean that European integration is without its strains&#13;
and conflicts. As we have indicated, there is considerable argument about&#13;
policies pursued by individual countries which affect competitors within Europe.&#13;
It is certainly not true that policy and attitudes towards intra-European trade&#13;
are identical to those for intra-American trade.&#13;
It might be argued that, given the ccr,mitment to the European-&#13;
Economic Community, it is collective trade with the outside world that is similar&#13;
to external trade for the United States. Above all, trade with the outside world&#13;
is marginal: the ratio of gross trade to GNP for the Community as a group is only&#13;
9 percent (Bergsten and Cline 1976, p.155), which is very close to the ratio for&#13;
the United States. In the case of manufactures, only 21 percent of the 1975 imports&#13;
of EEC and EFTA countries (largely the EEC) came from, and only 43 percent of&#13;
the exports went to, countries outside Western Europe. For total trade the ratios&#13;
were 39 percent for both imports and exports, which implies that the trade of&#13;
Europe as a whole with the rest of the world is close to being balanced (Schwartz&#13;
1977). Since only 21 percent of the total imports of manufactures of European&#13;
countries individually come from outside Europe, it might be feasible to have a&#13;
special trade adjustment policy to deal with this part of trade, and since there&#13;
is greater resistance to it than to intra-European trade, such a policy might help&#13;
to reduce the bias against it. Alternatively, one could focus just on imports&#13;
from developing countries, which accounted for 4 percent of manufactured imports&#13;
(18 percent of manufactured imports from outside Europe) and 20 percent of total&#13;
imports (half of total imports from outside Europe, with the bulk being petro-&#13;
leum) in 1975 (Ibid.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 112 -&#13;
In practice, a special adjustment program is virturally out of the&#13;
question. The reason is that it is other developed countries that account for&#13;
the bulk of imports from the rest of the world in competitive products. Thus, in&#13;
1975 82 percent of the manufactured imports of European countries from the out-&#13;
side world came from other developed countries (including the Centrally Planned&#13;
Economies) (Ibid.) There can be no question of introducing a program which within&#13;
the fragile context of European integration discriminates in favor of the exports&#13;
of other developed countries vis a vis those from the European countries them-&#13;
selves. This leaves the one possibility of a program specially oriented to&#13;
imports from developing countries, (which exists in the Netherlands). While this&#13;
does seem feasible and will be discussed in the succeeding chapter, there will be&#13;
objections both because of the prior commitment to intra-European trade, and&#13;
because of the sheer range of already existing intervention programs at both&#13;
national and Community levels. Furthermore, it should be noted that in the con-&#13;
text of the discriminatory trade agreements of the Community with particular&#13;
groups of developing countries (especially the Lome Convention), any special&#13;
assistance program oriented towards developing countries would probably be designed&#13;
to discriminate among them.&#13;
d. Japan&#13;
The most important features of the Japanese economy from the point&#13;
of view of the adjustment process and trade are the following: in the first place,&#13;
the Government has played a very important role in the entire process of indus-&#13;
trial development, and will continue to do so. Using a variety of formal and in-&#13;
formal policy instruments, it has focused its attention on a limited number of&#13;
industries in which Japan is intended to be competitive in future. Thus, policy&#13;
may be described as forward-looking and interventionist. Hirono (1978, p. 26)&#13;
states "industrial adjuste6eat policy measures, consisting in Japan of forward&#13;
planning and industrial adjustment assistance,are quite different from those&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 113 -&#13;
adjustment assistance measures found in some of the European countries,whose&#13;
objective    is to subsidize those affected industries either to maintain levels&#13;
of production in excess of those justified by demand or even to become com-&#13;
petitive once again with those exporting foreign manufacturers." In the second&#13;
place, Japan has perhaps the least developed welfare state system of any major&#13;
OECD country, and indeed the entire principle of state-provided compensation to&#13;
those affected by economic change is relatively little accepted. What assistance&#13;
to workers there is goes through the employers (Ibid.). In the third place, Japan's&#13;
economy is not very open, with the ratio of trade to GNP being only about 10&#13;
percent and, for whatever reason, Japan has engaged rather little in intra-&#13;
industrial specialization. Fourthly, and this is perhaps the most interesting&#13;
aspect of its situation, its relation to the most competitive developing-countries&#13;
is somewhat unique. One reason is the latter are strong competitors not so much&#13;
in the home market as in export markets, since thev are specializing in some of&#13;
the older categories of Japanese exports like clothing, simple consumer elec-&#13;
tronics and textiles. Another reason is that the Japanese are, unlike the Western&#13;
Europeans, not prepared to keep labor-intensive activities alive by importing&#13;
cheap foreign labor. For this reason, firms with a tradition in these products&#13;
have felt under strong economic pressure to relocate in neighboring countries.&#13;
Finally, in the Japanese political environment business seems to be an exceptionally&#13;
powerful lobby.&#13;
These-various aspects of the Japanese situation help to explain-its&#13;
unique approach to adjustment problems. A formal adjustment assistance cum com-&#13;
pensation program on the lines of that in the-United States would be quite out of&#13;
keeping, even -though the relatively small direct impact of trade would seem to make&#13;
it feasible. However, Japan is equally the economy in the best situation to&#13;
achieve coordinated structural adjustment on-the lines beloved by such authors as&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- ilj  -&#13;
Mukherjee (1978). The Government is accustomed to playing a key role in identify-&#13;
ing and developing the new sectors which will replace what is to be lost to&#13;
developing countries; it is also accustomed to work through and with firms; and,&#13;
finally, firms in the threatened sectors are under strong pressure, and have&#13;
excellent opportunities, to survive by making cooperative arrangements with the&#13;
developing countries through investment, sub-contracting and so forth. In this&#13;
context, the geographical proximity of the most dynamic developing countries and&#13;
their emergence as competitors in Japan's older exports is obviously a great help&#13;
(just as it is a threat which domestic protectionism cannot readily meet). Kojima&#13;
(1973, p.250) describes the ideal policy for Japan and other advanced countries as&#13;
"an integrated aid, investment-cum-preference, structural adjustment policy."&#13;
While the extension of the approach to the other developed countries is a very&#13;
questionable example of seeing the world through a mirror, there can be no doubt&#13;
that this is the obvious approach for Japan itself.&#13;
e. Conclusion&#13;
What has been brought out is the importance of remembering the&#13;
differences among the industrialized countries. Policies can hardly come from a&#13;
standard recipe book. On the contrary, the tradition of policy-making, consti-&#13;
tutional arrangements, attitudes to the market, the role of trade and resistance&#13;
to it, and other factors will determine what policies can be pursued. It is as&#13;
futile to recommend a grand, centralized "restructuring" of industry to the United&#13;
States, as it is to propose a massive program of income maintenance and compen-&#13;
sation to Japan, or a general trade adjustment program to Belgium. Granted the&#13;
objective of improving the access of developing countries' exports to the markets&#13;
of the developed, policy instruments must be judged in part in the context of the&#13;
special situations of different countries and supra-national authorities.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B. The Analysis of Adjustment Policy&#13;
Broadly speaking, the aim of adjustmeni policy is to lower the social&#13;
cost, redistribute the private cost, and above aLl make change more politically&#13;
acceptable. 14   Such a policy can consist of a number of elements, namely,&#13;
helpfor industry; direct assistance to affected areas; assistance to factor&#13;
mobility; compensation of factor owners   or areas; or provision of information./5&#13;
Most countries have programs under all these heads.   A country can also combine&#13;
these various elements into one program, which may be designed to deal with all&#13;
the problgms created by trade, with all the problems created by one declining&#13;
industry, with all the problems of a particular region, or with the problems of&#13;
the country as a whole. In our discussion below we start by examining the component&#13;
elements, and their strengths and weaknesses, in the context of specific examples,&#13;
and then proceed to an analysis of composite programs, whether oriented to trade,&#13;
to the problem of an industry, or to the overall development of the economy.&#13;
A   Tumlir (1976, p.20) defines the public policy function as "minimizing the&#13;
cost of adjustment and compensating the minimum cost or a part of it." This&#13;
definition corresponds to the first two parts of ours, but ignores the poli-&#13;
tical aspect. It can, however, be argued that political acceptability follows&#13;
from success with the first two and is, therefore, not an independent-&#13;
objective. Furthermore, Tumlir holds to the view that bribing the losers is&#13;
corrupt (Ibid., p.17). We emphasize political acceptability because it is a&#13;
necessary condition for the achievement of our major objective, namely, the&#13;
increased access by developing countries' exports to the matkets of developed&#13;
countries.&#13;
/5 Provision of information is the central part of what we term an "anticipatory"&#13;
adjustment policy. Giersch (1978, p.22) has in mind a different definition of&#13;
"anticipatory" adjustment assistance, which covers assistance to labor mobility;&#13;
relocation of firms; and regional policies. Under our definitions these are&#13;
all included as "adjustment assistance". It is not clear to us why Giersch&#13;
refers to these as "anticipatory". He may mean that the policies should be&#13;
created in general before any particular need for them, which is what Tumlir&#13;
emphasizes (1976, p. 19). He does not seem to mean that action should be taken&#13;
before any obvious need.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 116 -&#13;
C. Elements Of Adjustment Policy&#13;
a.   Assistance to Industry&#13;
Most trade-related intervention is aimed at helping existing indus-&#13;
tries and firms, simply because most intervention is protectionist. It is in this&#13;
context, in particular, that we observe most clearly the key distinction between&#13;
defensive and adjustment policies. Indeed, the relationship between the two is&#13;
very close because much of what is, in fact, protection is proposed as a vehicle&#13;
to adjustment. This is the case of "temporary," "emergency" protection, granted&#13;
in the context of "safeguard" provisions of such agreements as the GATT or the EEC&#13;
treaty, (or more often perhaps, outside the context of any such agreement at all).&#13;
What is the role of such putatively temporary protection in industrial adjustment?&#13;
This is the first question considered below.&#13;
It will be useful to distinguish between three different forms of&#13;
innovation by firms, namely, process, product and locational innovation. Process&#13;
innovation consists of reducing the cost of what is already produced. In the&#13;
context of competition with developing countries, this means an attempt to engineer&#13;
a factor-intensity reversal and thus save the affected activities (while damning&#13;
some others). Product innovation is horizontal specialization within the market,&#13;
leading either to intra-industrial trade or to specialization in higher quality or&#13;
location-protected activities for the developed country's market. Locational in-&#13;
novation can iwvolve vertical apecialization across frontiers, perhaps with direct&#13;
investment as well, or it can mean a move to a less developed region of the country.&#13;
The import of labor from developing countries may be regarded as a special form&#13;
of locational innovEtion.   What is important from our point of view is that process&#13;
imnovation is inherently a defensive reaction, while product and international&#13;
locational innovatlon are not.&#13;
It is obvious that adjustment of any kind is carried out by firms,&#13;
an irGustry being a much more a-:bitrarily defined and speculative entity.   Policy&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 117 -&#13;
can be directed towards whole groups of firms which bear the conventional name of&#13;
an industry, or to individual firms. Thus, we do not mean to imply by the title&#13;
"assistance to industry" exclusion of assistance targeted to individual firms.&#13;
However, it must be remembered that while subsidies or special favors through&#13;
government procurement can be, and frequently are, firm-specific, protection is&#13;
a general measure applying to all those who produce the protected product and&#13;
close substitutes.&#13;
a. i. Defensive assistance&#13;
Policy Measures and their Rationale. Faced with the realization&#13;
that a particular branch of industry is not competitive, given trading oppor-&#13;
tunities, a government which is unwilling to see an industry contract at an&#13;
unchecked rate may intervene by preserving a sustained high level of protection,&#13;
by introducing emergency protection, or by direct subsidization. We have already&#13;
seen that (leaving aside the latter) industries competitive with the exports of&#13;
developing countries are relatively highly protected and exemptions have been&#13;
made in their favour during GATT negotiations. Thus, in Robertson's terminology&#13;
(1977, pp.5-6) they are the beneficiaries of various "exceptions". In addition,&#13;
however, there exists "safeguard" protection, which serves to deal "with a sudden&#13;
surge of import competition" (Ibid., p.5). It is true that, strictly speaking,&#13;
a safeguard provision must refer to a clause in an agreement or treaty, which&#13;
allows escape from the agreement, when certain unforeseen events occur. In the&#13;
GATT, Article XIX provides for such an escape mechanism in the event that "unfore-&#13;
seen developments" and "obligations incurred under (the) Agreement" "cause or&#13;
threaten serious injury to domestic producers" (GATT, Article XIX, Clause l.(a)).&#13;
In practice, because of defects in the clause and its lack of acceptability (Ibid.,&#13;
p.7 and pp.21-2; Tumlir 1974, p.262) most emergency protection, while clearly&#13;
directed against "sudden surges" in import protection, has occurred outside the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 118 -&#13;
GATT, or any other, legal framework, and cannot, therefore, be related to the idea&#13;
of a "safeguard" provision in an agreement. While this is a fact of considerable&#13;
importance in terms of the current state of international trade law, it is of&#13;
little relevance to us. From the point of view of restrictive effect, what is&#13;
relevant is that (whether within the GATT or not) unforeseen threats of import&#13;
penetration are met by "emergency" protection. Sometimes direct subsidization&#13;
is added. /6&#13;
What is the economic rationale underlying the use of emergency&#13;
protection? It is important to note that, unlike the 'exceptions', emergency&#13;
protection is usually introduced as a temporary measure. It is argued either&#13;
that the domestic firms need a breathing space in which to learn to meet the&#13;
competition or that the cost of adjustment is reduced by slowing it down. Thus,&#13;
again unlike permanent exceptions to tariff reductions, emergency protection is&#13;
seen as part of the adjustment process.&#13;
The Economic Logic of Emergency Protection. Let us examine this&#13;
logic more closely. Obviously, emergency protection is granted to those pro-&#13;
ducing directly competitive products, usually by means of a quota restriction of&#13;
some kind. There is almost never a restriction on new investment by the firms&#13;
(except perhaps in the case of highly visible large firms in such industries as&#13;
steel). Very often these very firms have been struggling for years under the impact&#13;
of competition which they have been unable to escape. It was for that very reason&#13;
that they have b'een a fierce protectionist lobby (Miles 1973 p. 106 and pp. 112-3;&#13;
Sinclair 1978    , (B), and (C)).   They have been unable to diversify beyond the&#13;
reach of the developing countries' exports. Since the government's action has raised&#13;
/6 Examples of direct subsidization of import-affected industries are steel, and&#13;
some labor-intensive industries via such policies as the Temporary Employment&#13;
Subsidy of the United Kingdom.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 119 -&#13;
the profitability of producing the existing product lines, there is no reason&#13;
whatsoever to suppose that the opportunity will now be taken to invest in quite&#13;
new lines. On the contrary, one of two things is likely to occur: nothing, or an&#13;
attempt to use new-found profitability to reduce process costs, largely by saving&#13;
labor, or (more technically) to try to engineer a factor intensity reversal. The&#13;
latter is particularly likely since the threatened firms have obtained the pro-&#13;
tection because of their unwillingness to exit from the industry, while the new&#13;
protection is not guaranteed to be permanent. Thus, their breathing space is&#13;
virtually certain to be used to engineer a labor-saving revolution in the industry,&#13;
to the extent that this is feasible.&#13;
Under what circumstances will this protection indeed be temporary?&#13;
Obviously, the firms must either succeed with their attempt to regain viability or&#13;
the next time round government must be prepared to resist pressures for renewed&#13;
protection, which they were unable to resist the first time, after substantial&#13;
new investment has taken place and after the-principle of protection has been&#13;
granted. New political backbone is always a possibility, but it would be&#13;
unreasonable to rely on it. What of the factor intensity reversal? Perhaps the&#13;
best general comment is Robertson's (1977, pp.8-9), which deserves quotation in full:&#13;
"For the most part, increased protection has been explained as&#13;
temporary action, designed to give the import-competing industry&#13;
time to adjust by improving its productivity, to become competitive&#13;
again, or to allow the industry to decline gradually with&#13;
resources moving to other activities. In most cases, however, the&#13;
'temporary' measures have been maintained. Why? Because the&#13;
innovations introduced by the import-competing industries to&#13;
improve their productivity have been promptly adopted, and&#13;
usually adapted, by the industry in the developing countries.&#13;
The industrialised countries have therefore stepped up their&#13;
research-and-development effort and the process has been repeated.&#13;
The upshot has been a steady flow of research-and-development resources&#13;
into the creation, in the industrialised countries, of unnecessarily&#13;
capital-intensive technologies to supply standard consumer items at&#13;
the lower end of the technology scale - textiles, clothing, footwear&#13;
and so on."&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 120 -&#13;
The failure to reverse a comparative disadvantage partly results from&#13;
the fact that if the developed countries' comparative advantage is based on&#13;
human skills and sophisticated entrepreneurship, no amount of increased physical&#13;
capital intensity in the production of standard goods with easily managed tech-&#13;
nologies will help. Factor intensity reversals don't happen. Fels (1972, Chart 1)&#13;
shows that in West Germany between 1959 and 1969 clothing remained twenty-ninth&#13;
out of twenty-nine, leather products fell from twenty-seventh to twenty-eighth,&#13;
and textiles remained eighteenth in the ranking of industries by total capital&#13;
intensity. No factor intensity reversals here! Furthermore, while the capital&#13;
intensity of textile production (measured with Lary's measure of value added per&#13;
employee) increases with the per capita income of countries, it does so to a&#13;
smaller extent than that of many other industries (Ibid., Charts 5a and b).&#13;
De Bandt (1975, Tables 1 through 4) indicates that the remuneration of factors in&#13;
the textiles and clothing industries in the developed countries is below the&#13;
industrial average in France, and there has been no tendency for this relative&#13;
position to improve, -    As de Bandt points out (Ibid., p.42), the low elasticity&#13;
of substitution in textiles "indicates that there is no possibility of factor&#13;
proportion reversal." Thus, the attempt of firms to surpass the capital intensity&#13;
of industry as a whole has been a futile chase after a distant and moving&#13;
target. While there has been some tendency for the labor saving effect of capital&#13;
formation in industries competitive with developing countries to exceed the&#13;
average, at least in Germany, (Fels and Glisman 1975, Table A2), this has been far&#13;
from sufficient for the purpose. What has occurred is exactly what Robertson describes.&#13;
/7 Supporting evidence that textiles and clothing remain relatively labor-&#13;
intensive is provided in Balassa (May 1977, Appendix Table 1), Neu (1976, p.172),&#13;
and Commission of the European Communities (July 1978, Table V).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 121 -&#13;
The consequence is, of course, that when the initial "temporary"&#13;
protection comes up for reconsideration the government tends to find itself con-&#13;
strained by the millstones it has hung around its own neck. It faces virtually&#13;
irresistible pressure to renew, and indeed extend the scope of the protection.&#13;
The reason for the extension is that usually some other industry is adversely&#13;
affected - clothing, for example, by protection to textiles. Since the former is&#13;
also largely import-substituting vis a vis developing countries, it too can be helped&#13;
by protection, and the textile producers will try to extend protection to clothing&#13;
both to avoid the appearance of a-counter-lobby and to preserve their own&#13;
customers. Then fibre ptoducers also join-in. (It is only if a significant pro-&#13;
portion of producers downstream are exporters that this ploy will not work, as steel&#13;
producers may soon discover.) Such a steady deepening and widening of temporary&#13;
protection has occurred in the key case of the textile and clothing industry.&#13;
Furthermore, if one examines a recent Commission of the European Communities paper&#13;
on the textiles and clothing industry, following the latest and most stringent&#13;
Multi-Fibre Agreement, no recognition can be discovered of the fundamental uncom-&#13;
petitiveness of most of the industry, and no suggestions that make sense of how&#13;
protection is to be "temporary" this time,. although that fig leaf is still carried&#13;
before the nakedness of policy (Commission of the European Communities July 1978,&#13;
pp. 4-5). All such "temporary" protection of major industries is likely to become&#13;
permanent. /8&#13;
/8 The interesting question is Why do the authorities of developed countries believe&#13;
(or pretend to believe) that the competitive advantage of the developing&#13;
countries can be so readily reversed? One explanation may be that they have&#13;
become accustomed from dealing with inter-developed country trade to what&#13;
appear to be more arbitrary and reversible bases for trade, such as brand names,&#13;
technological leads, or product variety. It is a common assumption of developed&#13;
countries' governments that, given adequate expenditures, any of these can be&#13;
reversed.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 122 -&#13;
Time-Bound Emergency Protection. There is also the argument that&#13;
clearly announced "temporary" protection is valuable not so much to give firms a&#13;
breathing space to discover how to meet the unmeetable but rather to reduce&#13;
adjustment costs by slowing adjustment down. This is particularly important for&#13;
reducing the private costs of factors which are fixed in the short-to-medium run.&#13;
For that reason, experts such as Robertson (1977, p.63) stress that any emergency&#13;
protection must have a clearly defined time limit. If that limit were believed,&#13;
firms would presumably not undertake futile investment, and the effect of the.&#13;
protection would merely be to slow down the process, as desired. Several points&#13;
should be remembered. In the first place, part of the cost of slowing down the&#13;
process of adjustment is the postponement of the benefits. In the second place,&#13;
the policy is internally inconsistent: it involves maintaining the pull of&#13;
resources towards an industry, vhile at the same time attempting to ensure that&#13;
they leave. Certainly, it makes no sense unless protection falls steadily and&#13;
there is some new investment. In the third place, it is not clear that costs for&#13;
those who will lose their jobs are much lower this way, unless the plant or plants&#13;
are so important in a particular area that closure affects the general length of&#13;
unemployment in the local labor market.   Even then compensation car make up for&#13;
the additional cost and save the resources wasted in the industry during the period&#13;
of protection. Price (1978, p.86) gives the interesting story of the Shelton&#13;
Works of the British Steel Corporation. It employed some 3,000 workers to make&#13;
164,000 tons of steel a year, and had been losing E 12 million a year after 1975.&#13;
After three years of agony the plant was closed in June 1978. The Government had&#13;
maintained an additional 1,500 people employed (the rest were found employment else-&#13;
where) at a total cost of E 36 million, or i 24,000 per unwanted man, (which ignores&#13;
the low value at the margin of half a million tons of extra steel). As it is the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 121 -&#13;
workers are disgruntled about the low level of redundancy pay and the taxpayers'&#13;
money is incarcerated in unneeded steel. Clearly everybody would have been better&#13;
off'if the plant had been closed at once and the redundant workers had been&#13;
given as much as the present value of E 8,000 per man over three years.&#13;
4.30      There is a more fundamental objection.   It is virtually impossible to&#13;
prevent firms from renewed investment in the protected industry. They will hope&#13;
that when the time limit is reached the fear of the consequences will prevent&#13;
the government from carrying out its intentions. By giving the firms a new lease&#13;
of life the government has created hostages to fortune. The result will be a&#13;
waste as neither firms nor workers find themselves facing a secure policy environ-&#13;
ment and they bend their efforts to further influence over policy.&#13;
The Consequences of Defensive Protection Our discussion of "temporary"&#13;
"emergency" protection has led to two strong conclusions: firstly, if indeed&#13;
protection is temporary then it is likely to be an inefficient way of achieving&#13;
adjustment - certainly strong controls on the inflow of new factors are needed;&#13;
secondly, it is far more likely that the protection will become permanent,&#13;
especially if the industry affected is a large one. As the Community's paper on&#13;
the textile and clothing industry says,"The textile industry is a big employer&#13;
and as such is essential for the industrial, social and regional balance of the&#13;
Community's economy" (my underlining) (Commission of the European Communities&#13;
July 1978, p.4). There is no likelihood of temporary protection here if the&#13;
industry cannot survive without it.&#13;
That defensive protection imposes a welfare cost is obvious. What is&#13;
immediately relevant, however, is the loss of employment, since the key rationale&#13;
for protection is the preservation of employment.    It seems likely that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 124 -&#13;
emnlovment will not be areserved.   Let us consider the theory first.  Assume that&#13;
there is a fall in the world price of a relatively labor-intensive product, so&#13;
that it is faced with an increased comparative disadvantage in countries with&#13;
relative abundance of capital. The industry will no longer be able to compete&#13;
for fresh investment funds or for labor. Perhaps even maintenance of existing&#13;
capital will be unprofitable and there will be continued labor shortages and&#13;
high labor turnover. For the owners of sector-specific factors, such as exist-&#13;
ing capital or certain skills, this is an unpleasant situation indeed. Un-&#13;
fortunately, the capital is unlikely to become worthless very quickly and will&#13;
continue to be operated, while all the time plans will be made to reverse the&#13;
decline. One way is to import cheap labor or encourage new entrants into the&#13;
labor market, who will for one reason or another accept low wages. Yet another&#13;
is protection. Once the latter is achieved, fresh investment and the attraction&#13;
of labor again becomes possible. However, for a number of reasons the emphasis&#13;
will be on the accumulation of fresh capital. In the first place, protection&#13;
of labor-intensive industry can be expected to increase its capital-intensity&#13;
under standard neoclassical trade theory. In the second place, if one takes a&#13;
vintage capital approach, more investment in the newest vintages means a re-&#13;
duction in labor requirements, given, the level of demand. In the third place,&#13;
long term viability can be assured only by creating a factor intensity reversal.&#13;
Thus, there will be investment both in the development of new capital-intensive&#13;
technology and in its installation as soon as profits permit expanded investment&#13;
(which protection provides). The fact that protection may be temporary will&#13;
increase the intensity of search for such capital-intensive technology. Fourthly,&#13;
firms trying to ensure a future will put their trust in fixed capital, which&#13;
cannot "run away" if protection is reduced. Finally, governments will probably&#13;
help the "restructuring" process by providing subsidized capital. For all these&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 125 -&#13;
reasons, a substantial reduction in labor requirements per unit of output can&#13;
be expected in protected labor-intensive industry. If the industry faces&#13;
sluggish demand, as is the case for many of the vulnerable industries, the&#13;
9/&#13;
result could be a precipitous fall in the demand for labor.&#13;
The evidence supports this hypothesis. Frank (1977, Table 3-4) shows&#13;
that in the heavily protected United States textile industry the growth in&#13;
productivity per man-hour between 1963 and 1971 contributed to a reduction in&#13;
labor requirements at the rate of 9.7. percent per annum. For apparel the correspond-&#13;
ing figure was 7.4 percent per annum, while for the import-competing industries&#13;
as a whole it was only 4.3 percent. Indeed, in these two industries the rate&#13;
of labor displacement due to productivity growth rivaled that of such dynamic&#13;
sectors as electrical equipment and instruments. Tharakan (1975, Table 3) notes&#13;
that total capital per worker in clothing and leather products in Belgium increased&#13;
by 440 percent between 1958 and 1970, well above the average for industry as a&#13;
whole, although this was not true for textiles. Fels and Glisman (1975, Table&#13;
A2) indicate that the labor saving effect of gross fixed investment in Germany&#13;
was above the average for manufacturing between 1964 and 1970 for clothing, leather&#13;
products, musical instruments and related products, footwear, and textiles, as&#13;
well as for most raw material-intensive industries. The Economist (2nd December&#13;
1978, p.113) notes that against a bleak productivity trend in the United Kingdom&#13;
9/ It might be noted as a special case that, if protection is discriminatory&#13;
(as in the MFA), trade diversion may create almost as much employment loss&#13;
as would have occurred without such protection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 126 -&#13;
"some manufacturing sectors stand out: instrument engineering and, more&#13;
surprisingly, clothing and footwear, where output per man has risen an average&#13;
3.4 percent through the four lean years. But the average is a dire 0.4 percent".&#13;
For us this aspect of the recent performance of the United Kingdom economy&#13;
is less surprising.&#13;
A rapid rise in productivity in firms trying to stay ahead of rising&#13;
wages in labor intensive industry is to be expected. It is to be expected even&#13;
without protection, in part simply because marginal firms perish first and they&#13;
are likely to be the least productive. However, protection helps because it&#13;
provides resources to otherwise finance-starved industries. Isard (1973)&#13;
analyses the United States textile industry in the context of a vintage capital&#13;
model and shows, as one would expect, that "employment per unit output with&#13;
new plant and equipment is between 35 and 49 percent of the unit labor require-&#13;
ment with marginally profitable plant and equipment" (Ibid.,p.403). Thus, any&#13;
new investment leads to a sharp fall in employment, given the state of demand.&#13;
Moreover, Isard indicates that investment responded powerfully to protection.&#13;
Following the LTA, investment rose from the 1953-61 annual average of about $300&#13;
million in 1958 dollars to approximately $800 million in 1966 and averaged over&#13;
$500 million during 1967-9 (Ibid., p.410). Leaving aside entirely the issue of&#13;
economic efficiency, it is clear that a higher growth of imports would have been&#13;
compatible with the same level of employment, if there had been less investment.&#13;
This substantial investment also made it virtually impossible subsequently to&#13;
reduce protection.&#13;
It should be stressed that it is merely a plausible hypothesis that&#13;
protection cum labor-saving investment are alternatives to a more liberal import&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 127 -&#13;
policy. It is not clear that the former will be superior to the latter with&#13;
regard to employment over anything but the very short run. Thus, according to&#13;
Frank's figures, employment in the United States' textile industry fell by 46 per-&#13;
cent between 1963 and 1971, while that in apparel fell by 25 percent. In both&#13;
cases it was productivity improvement and, we would argue, to some extent induced&#13;
productivity improvement, that had this effect. It is interesting to note that,&#13;
if one compares the employment change in the textile industries of France,&#13;
Germany and the United Kingdom between 1972 and 1977 one finds that Germany&#13;
experienced the sharpest fall in employment (27 percent), even though the output&#13;
reduction was the smallest (2.4 percent). Thus, German producers maintained&#13;
competitiveness by increasing labor productivity. While the industry's viability&#13;
was thus preserved, employment was clearly not     (Commission of the European&#13;
Communities July 1978, Tables VIII and X).&#13;
One of the most interesting, because precisely defined, examples of the&#13;
dilemma is provided by the history of the jute industry of Dundee in the U.K. In&#13;
this case the existence of protection stimulated the adoption of an alternative&#13;
technology, based on polypropylene, which is relatively capital-intensive. The&#13;
result has been the virtual disappearance of the industry and the loss of about&#13;
58 percent of the jobs between 1959 and 1973 (McDowall and Draper 1978, p.10).&#13;
The firms managed to survive by switching to the new technology and the decline&#13;
in employment was probably slowed, both of these effects being helped by the&#13;
protection. Yet, as Odling-Smee notes in his introduction to the study, "although&#13;
protection postpones trade adjustment, it may precipitate technological. adjust-&#13;
ment" (Ibid., p.xvii); However, since most of the original workers have had&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 128 -&#13;
to leave their jobs, "There is a revealing contrast between the willingness&#13;
of governments to protect jobs that are threatened by international com-&#13;
petition (estimated now to be 1,500) and their unwillingness to protect jobs&#13;
threatened by technological change (seven or eight times as many' jobs lost&#13;
over the last decade)" (Ibid.).&#13;
Perhaps the observation that protection does not preserve employment&#13;
except in the very short run should not surprise us. Governments are largely&#13;
concerned with the short run. Furthermore, the firms are the major force for&#13;
protection. As we have already argued, and Little, Scitovsky and Scott (1970,&#13;
p.290) state "The best organized and most effective resistance to the freeing&#13;
of imports of manufactures from developing countries has often come, and is&#13;
likely to come, from profit earners rather than wage earners". It may be&#13;
argued that protection of labor-intensive industry does not, and is not intended&#13;
to, preserve employment, with the firms barely interested in the objective and&#13;
governments unconcerned provided a visible, foreign,irritant is removed.&#13;
a. ii. Adjustment assistance for industry&#13;
Having considered what an industrial adjustment policy is not, let&#13;
us consider what it might be. As we have discussed above, the adjustment routes&#13;
for the firm consist of product innovation and specialization, and locational&#13;
innovation, especially vertical specialization across international frontiers.&#13;
These are classic entrepreneurial functions, involving ideas and superior manage-&#13;
ment. What can government contribute?&#13;
A key element of successful adaptation is good management. Government&#13;
policies exist to help here. For example, in the United States' trade assistance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 129 -&#13;
program (Frank 1977, p.44) there are funds for the payment of consultants.&#13;
If the firms do, in fact, have good, unrecognized opportunities and their&#13;
bankers are unwilling to lend even for consultancy services, this government&#13;
assistance can be efficient. Up to the end of July, 1978 eighty firms had&#13;
received $1,287,000 in payments for technical assistance under the Trade Act&#13;
of 1974 in less than three years (Department of Commerce unpublished information).&#13;
By contrast, under the Trade'Expansion Act of 1962 disbursements under this head&#13;
were only $1,806,400 in all the years of its operation (Frank 1977, Table 4-2).&#13;
How successful was this assistance? It appears that, of twenty-eight firms given&#13;
loans under the 1974 Act by September 30th, 1977, two were already out of&#13;
business and eight were delinquent by June 30th, 1978 (Department of Commerce&#13;
unpublished information). This seems to be a high rate of attrition so early in the&#13;
program and in the repayment periods of the firms. However, delinquency on sub-&#13;
sequent loans is only an indirect test of the value of consultancy services.&#13;
Since many of the firms in vulnerable industries are small, they are eligible&#13;
for assistance under small business programs which exist in most developed&#13;
countries.&#13;
Another method of improving the management of weak firms, particularly&#13;
beloved in certain countries in Europe, is the merger.    The theory is either that&#13;
economies of scale in production or research and development need to be exploited&#13;
or that stronger management teams should be spread more thinly. During the 1960s&#13;
mergers were very fashionable in the United Kingdom, there being a boom in&#13;
1967-9 (Kay and Hanna 1977, p.93), and the government-created Industrial Re-&#13;
organization Corporation played a key catalytic role (Ibid., p39). The CIASI plays&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 130 -&#13;
a similar role in France (Price 1978, p.3): "The CIASI's universal remedy&#13;
is to select a healthy firm in the same line of business, and persuade it to&#13;
take over its ailing colleague" (Ibid., p.4). There have been some striking&#13;
successes: Peugot's merger with Citroen; the creation of an expanded General&#13;
Electric Company in the United Kingdom; and the birth of a viable United Kingdom&#13;
ball-bearing manufacturer (Ransome-Hoffman-Pollard) (Kay and Hanna 1977, p.39).&#13;
There have been equally spectacular failures, starting with British Leyland&#13;
and continuing with "le Plan Boussac" of 1975, which failed to rescue the ailing&#13;
textile giant. Whatever the merits of this approach may be, and they are&#13;
certainly controversial, the relevance to the exports of developing countries&#13;
is marginal, largely because they do not compete with firms who are the focus&#13;
of this sort of assistance.&#13;
Can government play a role in the development of new products? One&#13;
important area is assistance to research and development across the spectrum of&#13;
industry. There is a good argument that the market will under-supply such&#13;
activity, both because of the desire to avoid risk and because the innovator is&#13;
usually unable to appropriate the full benefits of his innovation. In fact,&#13;
direct and indirect assistance to such expenditure is a feature of policy in&#13;
virtually all developed countries (Fels 1976; and Denton 1976). However, the&#13;
assistance is far from neutral across industry, but has been heavily concentrated&#13;
on certain specific industries, especially aerospace, advanced electronics and&#13;
nuclear power. Thus, in the United Kingdom between 1971/2 and 1973/74 90 percent&#13;
of Government expenditure on industrial innovation went on aerospace and nuclear&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 131 -&#13;
power (Denton 1976, Table 5.2). The development of Concorde alone far exceeded&#13;
the cost of support for general industrial research and development. While&#13;
such assistance may play a role in developing new industries for specialization&#13;
by developed countries, it is largely irrelevant to the aim of helping firms&#13;
in directly vulnerable industries. In such cases as clothing, footwear, or&#13;
textiles it is not easy to see what government can contribute to product innova-&#13;
tion.&#13;
Governments can and do provide a legal framework for vertical&#13;
specialization across frontiers or even complete relocation. Offshore assembly&#13;
provisions in tariff codes are a major help to successful international locational&#13;
innovation (Finger 1975). These are of value to domestic firms, especially&#13;
because they make it possible to compete with firms located entirely overseas&#13;
(for example United States'against Japanese firms), thus reducing dislocation.&#13;
Again, this is a help largely to bigger firms, especially those who have&#13;
technological or marketing advantages. Governments can also insure firms&#13;
against the risks of overseas investment and negotiate agreements with govern-&#13;
ments of developing countries on the treatment of foreign investment.&#13;
A more active, industry-wide approach is being taken in a number of&#13;
countries. The National Economic Development Council of the United Kingdom&#13;
has sponsored detailed examinations of the problems of a wide range of industries.&#13;
A similar approach has been taken in the Netherlands (Evers 1975, p.172). We&#13;
have been unable to discover clear examples of success following such an approach,&#13;
and there is the great danger that these industry-specific fora will become an&#13;
excellent vehicle for organizing protectionist lobbies and asking for subsidies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 132 -&#13;
for defensive process innovation. A particularly interesting recent case of&#13;
industry-specific support has been the development of a special program for&#13;
the United States shoe industry. On July 20th, 1977 the Under Secretary of&#13;
Commerce announced a special three-year $56 million program for this industry.&#13;
"The program included formation of specialist teams of experts in the fields of&#13;
management, production, marketing and finance to provide consultative services&#13;
to trade-injured shoe manufacturers. The specialist teams were in operation&#13;
during the fall of 1977, adapting the technical and financial assistance&#13;
available under the Trade Act to the unique individual needs of small footwear&#13;
firms. Other features of the special program were funding for the Federal&#13;
loans and loan guarantees for investment in new plant and equipment and new&#13;
technology by certified shoe firms, as well as obtaining the voluntary co-&#13;
operation of retailers in increasing orders to trade-injured shoe manufacturers&#13;
as a spur to domestic production.... During the last five months of 1977, EDA&#13;
(Economic Development Administration) received 89 petitions from footwear firms,&#13;
of which 53 were accepted for filing and 45 shoe companies were certified eligible&#13;
to apply for trade adjustment assistance". (Department of Commerce January 1978,&#13;
p.1). Apart form the provision of firm-specific technical advice the main&#13;
feature of the program appears to be finance of new plant, equipment and technology&#13;
at rates of interest below those available to the firms on the market. It seems&#13;
rather likely that such investment will be cost-reducing in large part rather&#13;
than involve major product innovation.&#13;
Obviously the main actual role of government is the provision of money.&#13;
As Blackhurst, Marian and Tumlir note (1978, Appendix Table 1.4),subsidies&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 133 -&#13;
to enterprises have reached very high levels - 7.1 percent of GNP in Ireland,-&#13;
6.7 percent in Norway, 4.1 percent in Belgium, and 2.8 percent of GNP in both&#13;
France and the United Kingdom in 1976. Moreover, this presumably omits the&#13;
provision of funds for investment, on much of which no financial return can&#13;
be expected.  Lack of resources for restructuring is hardly the problem.    The&#13;
issue is what they are used for. While generalization is very difficult, given&#13;
the sheer range of involvement of most modern-'governments, there is certainly&#13;
reason to suppose that assistance to existing vulnerable industry is strongly&#13;
defensive. Thus, to pursue the case of footwear but this time in Europe,&#13;
Sinclair (1978 (B)) concludes his evaluation of the EEC's program by stating&#13;
"The overall objective is to spend as much as is necessary to make EEC manufacturers&#13;
competitive with ldc suppliers".&#13;
When governments are not subsidizing defensive investment, they some-&#13;
times underwrite industrial contraction. This is a policy to be followed when&#13;
successful adjustment within the industry is impossible. A key component is&#13;
compensation. A decision-making role in contraction is being taken in such&#13;
key industries as steel and shipbuilding, which are, or are in the process of&#13;
being, nationalized in several countries. In the steel industries of Belgium,&#13;
France and the United Kingdom, for example, the governments are promoting and&#13;
financing restructuring and contraction. However, it should be remembered that&#13;
the actual impact of the government is to slow the rate of decline, although&#13;
it may be argued that, by providing genexous redundancy pay and buying out the&#13;
owners, the governments are making contraction more politically acceptable.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 134 -&#13;
If we examine the logical basis for direct government assistance&#13;
to adjustment by vulnerable industries and firms and also take actual experience&#13;
into account, the positive role for government is at best marginal. The problem&#13;
is a lack not of money but of ideas, and governments are much better at providing&#13;
the former than the latter. When governments do intervene heavily they are&#13;
likely to finance largely defensive activities which require long term protection&#13;
for financial viability. Obviously, this is inimical to the interests of the&#13;
developing countries. Governments can make a contribution by providing a frame-&#13;
work for innovation, by financing technical assistance for small firms, and&#13;
perhaps by promoting mergers and expenditure on research and development. On&#13;
balance, however, the most valuable single act would be to stop intervening to&#13;
preserve existing patterns of output and to make the acceptance of change more&#13;
widespread.&#13;
a. iii. Promotion of new industry&#13;
Instead of concerning itself with senescent industry, a government&#13;
can focus its efforts on actively encouraging the birth of new and dynamic&#13;
industry. In countries where rapid growth has occurred, such as Japan and&#13;
Germany, special adjustment programs have been unnecessary (Frank 1977, pp.139&#13;
and 144). In this case we return to. the insight that adjustment to trade is&#13;
just one aspect of total adjustment, and that if the total works well nothing&#13;
special will have to be done about trade.&#13;
Japan and France have perhaps been the most successful in picking the&#13;
next generation of "winners". Both have been prepared to employ frankly dis-&#13;
criminatory policy to encourage the development of particular firms or sectors&#13;
(Shonfield 1965, p.165; Krause and Sekiguchi 1976, p.413; Trezise and Suzuki&#13;
pp. 784-5). There is considerable controversy about the actual value of this&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 135 -&#13;
role, but it is clearly believed in by many. Hirono (1978) stresses the role&#13;
of forward planning of the industrial structure in the Japanese approach to&#13;
adjustment. Kojima (1973) emphasizes the same point that rapid and deliberate&#13;
development of the new is a corollary of abandonment of the old. If these&#13;
governments are successful, they will clearly be making a valuable contribution&#13;
to adjustment as well as to their own countries' development.&#13;
It has to be noted that, beyond the general encouragement of research&#13;
and development and the sharing of certain major risks, the wisdom of inter-&#13;
vention to promote specific industries is unclear. In many countries the&#13;
inability of govcrnment to pick winners is as clear as the obverse seems to be&#13;
in Japan (OECD June 1979, p.105). Furthermore, even in Japan it may be argued&#13;
that the closer the country gets to the frontier of knowledge the less likely&#13;
such planning is to work (Giersch 1978, p.18).&#13;
In sum, it does appear that an essentially forward-looking attitude&#13;
to the process of change and adjustment at the industrial level could be a&#13;
very valuable part of adjustment. It is also arguable that some governments&#13;
can and should continue to try to pick and nurture the industries of the future.&#13;
While this seems to have worked in the past in certain cases, it is a policy&#13;
subject to very great risks partl.y because of the tendency to put too many eggs&#13;
in one bureaucratic basket. Not only can the swans turn out consistently to&#13;
be geese, but, what is worse, a government bent-on the defensive can readily -&#13;
pass off what it knows to be geese as future swans. In this area more. than&#13;
most, policy must be judged in the light of the experience, capacity and attitudes&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 136 -&#13;
of the governments and countries concerned,&#13;
b.    Assistance to Regions and Communities&#13;
There are two distinct but related ways in which the regional&#13;
dimension of change can hinder economic adjustment. Firstly, competition from&#13;
overseas can have a concentrated effect on a region (or regions), which already&#13;
has above-average unemployment and below-average income. Secondly, even when&#13;
this is not true, the rapid decline of a regionally concentrated industry or&#13;
the closure of a large plant can have a dramatic effect upon a particular&#13;
community. In such circumstances the private and social costs are not only&#13;
likely to be relatively high, because the unemployment is longer and the&#13;
10/&#13;
secondary effects on those living in the area more inescapable,    but political&#13;
resistance is likely to be well-organized and effective.&#13;
The obvious general policy for securing more even development of&#13;
the various regions of a country is the provision of special incentives to&#13;
firms willing to move to the less favored areas. Such incentives, usually to&#13;
investment but sometimes to employment (as with the Regional Employment Premium&#13;
of the United Kingdom), are a feature of regional policy throughout Europe.&#13;
10/ Workers laid off at the time of plant closure are likely to be relatively&#13;
old because the plant will not have been hiring for some time prior to&#13;
closure. Older workers find it more difficult to find new jobs. (See&#13;
Frank 1977, pp.64-5). Bale (1976) notes that the average length of un-&#13;
employment of his trade-displaced workers was 31 weeks while Baldwin and&#13;
Mutti (1973 (1973, pp.159-60) report the average duration of unemployment&#13;
at 11 weeks in 1969. (Bale's sample of workers consisted of those laid&#13;
off in 1969-70, a virtually identical period). The closure of any large&#13;
employer will have a significant effect on those providing services in an&#13;
area, such as shop-keepers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 137 -&#13;
In the United States direct subsidies to firms are not a feature of Federal&#13;
policy (Frank 1977, Chapter 6), but they are provided by various units of the&#13;
local governments in a somewhat haphazard way. The economic logic may be&#13;
that firms do not face the full price at the margin of exacerbating agglomera-&#13;
tion costs in richer areas, nor do they obtain the benefit of increased use&#13;
of existing infrastructure in poorer regions. If wages are sticky and labor&#13;
mobility poor, the alternative to incentives may be permanently elevated rates&#13;
11/&#13;
of unemployment.     In certain cases governments may use direct coercion to&#13;
compel firms to relocate in regions with high unemployment, sometimes with&#13;
disastrous results as in the case of the Linwood plant in Scotland of Rootes&#13;
Motors (Kay and Hanna 1977, p.36). The advantages of incentive policies are&#13;
that they are general, predictable and automatic. To the extent that they&#13;
succeed, they will lower the resistance to plant closure in any given area&#13;
both because the existing level of unemployment is low and there will be&#13;
greater confidence that new firms will arrive.&#13;
In spite of the advantages, we must recognize several drawbacks.&#13;
The great danger is, of course, that the incentives do not reduce regional in-&#13;
equality in what gives the developed countries their comparative advantage,&#13;
namely, human capital, technical ingenuity and entrepreneurship. It seems likely&#13;
that many firms see location in a region with somewhat lower wages as an escape&#13;
route, when competing with low-cost producers in developing countries. Unfortunately,&#13;
11/ Fels (1974, p.253) notes of West Germany that "Workers..do not hesitate to&#13;
move from one industry to another; but they are very reluctant to change&#13;
their place of living".&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 138 -&#13;
this is nut only a defensive act from the point of view of the developing&#13;
countries, but is likely to prove unviable in the longer term because the wage&#13;
differential within any developed country is small in relation to that between&#13;
developed and developing countries. As firms in developing countries master&#13;
the managerial problem of producing many labor-intensive goods, we may find&#13;
12/&#13;
that the incentives have created a concentration of vulnerable industry.&#13;
Another way of helping poorer regions, which does not involve support&#13;
for any particular firms, is the financing of essential infrastructure. This&#13;
has been an important part of policy in the United States (Frank 1977, pp.82-8)&#13;
and in Europe. In the latter a significant example is provided by the large&#13;
expenditures on the Mezzogiorno in Italy. In the EEC the European Investment&#13;
Bank exists in large part to finance infrastructure projects in poorer regions.&#13;
Indeed, over its history it has made 33 percent of all its loans to the Mezzogiorno&#13;
(European Investment Bank 1978, pp.12 and 19). However, this approach too&#13;
has its drawbacks if it does not compensate for the essential weaknesses in&#13;
the human material. As the EIB says of the Mezzogiorno after almost a generation&#13;
of special assistance "the entrepreneurial spirit of initiative, innovation&#13;
and willingness to take risks is not as yet much in evidence" (Ibid., p.16).&#13;
The same comment could be made on some of the areas of declining industry in&#13;
the United Kingdom.&#13;
Particularly severe political problems are created by the closure&#13;
of a large employer in an already-depressed region or one totally dependent on&#13;
that particular firm. For this reason specially tailored programs to deal with&#13;
12/ This problem can be minimized by restricting the industry-coverage of&#13;
regional incentives.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 139 -&#13;
such events can be satisfactory from the political point of view. In the&#13;
United States interesting examples of community-specific adjustment programs&#13;
are those of the Defense Department's Office of Economic Adjustment, which&#13;
was established to provide help to communities adversely affected by the closure&#13;
of military bases. According to Frank (1977, p.77) more than two hundred&#13;
communiLies were helped between 1961 and 1975.   The aim of the OEA is to co-&#13;
ordinate the efforts of the government departments and to advise the communities&#13;
themselves. Most of the jobs created stem from induced private investment&#13;
expenditures rather than direct government expenditures. The OEA itself helps&#13;
the community to prepare a development plan and to obtain aid from federal&#13;
agencies for job training and construction of improved infrastructure. A&#13;
particularly successful effort was that in Wichita, Kansas, where unemployment&#13;
dropped from 11.6 percent in June 1971 to 4.7 percent in April 1972 (Ibid.,&#13;
p.76). Another example of a strong community-oriented program is that in South&#13;
Bend, Indiana following the closure of a Studebaker plant in December, 1963&#13;
(Ibid., pp. 79-82). The immediate effect was a jump in the unemployment rate&#13;
from 2.4 percent to over 9 percent. A coordinated program was put together at&#13;
the instigation of the President, which focused particularly on labor training&#13;
and attracting new industry to the area. The program was highly successful&#13;
and unemployment fell to 2.1 percent of-the labor force by October 1965. Price&#13;
(1978, p.12) discusses the closely comparable case of Volkswagen, which decided&#13;
following huge losses in 1974 that it would have to make 25,000 workers redundant.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 140 -&#13;
The Government of West Germany refused to help the firm itself, but provided&#13;
DM 250 million to encourage the creation of new activities in the affected&#13;
regions. As it happened, Volkswagen's situation improved and the redundancies&#13;
that occurred were readily absorbed at a cost to the state of DM 8,400 per&#13;
worker. British Steel is now running similar programs in areas of plant closure.&#13;
Unfortunately, special programs to deal with the particular problems&#13;
of specific regions have their drawbacks as well. One is that they are inherently&#13;
arbitrary and inequitable. The only rationale is political and such programs&#13;
make it too obvious that politics in a democratic society is a race among special&#13;
interests trying to get their hands on the till. However, such programs are&#13;
certainly preferable to protection. Another drawback is that being ex post&#13;
and specific they are likely to create delays in the process of adjustment and&#13;
may even be seen as a means of negotiating how much adjustment to accept&#13;
at all (Tumlir 1976, p.19). Finally, the program makes sense only if the change&#13;
is very concentrated indeed in its effects. This will usually not be the case&#13;
with industries affected by developing countries' exports, except when the affected&#13;
industry is both large and regionally concentrated, as was true for Lancashire&#13;
cotton textiles. More usually it will be the closure of single large plants&#13;
that create the desire for a specially-tailored program. However, it should&#13;
also be noted that if the regional effect is not visible, there is no political&#13;
need for such a special program, in any case.&#13;
The probelm of satisfactory regional development is clearly complex&#13;
and the solution elusive. What does seem clear from our discussion is that&#13;
there is in certain cases a regional dimension to the costs imposed by competition&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 141 -&#13;
from developing countries and for that reason a regional dimension to the&#13;
political resistance. However, if one examines the solutions, one finds that&#13;
they all have disadvantages. General incentives to firms may simply be a&#13;
part of a process of encouraging the concentration of new, vulnerable industry&#13;
where there used to be old, vulnerable industry. A policy of concentrated&#13;
assistance to deal with the closure of a large employer is politically effective&#13;
but arbitrary and inequitable. It also does not seem to be well-suited to the&#13;
problem created by most of the exports of developing countries, which are not&#13;
generally competitive with large plants (although there are exceptions). In the&#13;
long term the concentration of vulnerable industry in the poorer regions of&#13;
many developed countries can be dealt with only by spreading the factors which&#13;
give the developed countries their comparative advantage more evenly. Un-&#13;
fortunately, just as governments cannot print real wealth, they cannot create&#13;
entrepreneurship, talent and skill wherever they wish. Thus, regional policies&#13;
will always play a modest role in the adjustment process even if a useful one.&#13;
c.   Labor Mobility and Training&#13;
If we have limited success in moving the mountain to Mohamed, what&#13;
are the prospects for moving Mohamed to the mountain? Alternatively, Mohamed&#13;
can be retrained thus making it more attractive for the mountain to move. A&#13;
broad range of interventions in thse labor market is a characteristic of most&#13;
developed countries and the aim of raising employment and reducing unemployment&#13;
is, of course, far wider than that of facilitating adjustment to trade-induced&#13;
change. Nonetheless, it is of relevance to us also, since by reducing the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 142 -&#13;
period of unemployment and raising the expected income in a new job, such&#13;
intervention can lower both the social and private costs of economic change&#13;
and increase its political acceptability.&#13;
Swedish labor market policy provides what might be considered an&#13;
extreme example of activism. The budget of the National Labour Market Board is&#13;
about 8 billion Swedish Kroner (US$ 2 billion) to service a labor force of just&#13;
over four million. An equivalent level of expenditure per worker in the United.&#13;
States would see the total cost at about US$ 50 billion! The sum represents&#13;
8 percent of the budget and 2½ percent of GNP. In 1976/77 41 percent of ex-&#13;
penditures went for employment creation projects, (such as public relief work,&#13;
special relief work, and subsidization of stock-piling by firms); 18 percent&#13;
went on training (of which a very substantial part went to subsidize the training&#13;
costs in-plant of workers threatened by lay-off); 16 percent went on training&#13;
and placing various categories of hard-to-place labor; 7 percent went on informa-&#13;
tion services; and there were smaller amounts for cash assistance to unemployed&#13;
persons, for refugees, for regional assistance and for vocational and geographical&#13;
mobility. It is clear that, when account is taken of direct wage subsidization,&#13;
the balance of expenditure is aimed at preserving existing employment. In&#13;
factD policy consists of a series of make-shifts designed to paper over the&#13;
cracks in the overall situation. As the National Labour Market Board (1977, p.16)&#13;
states,"Certain tendencies occurring during the past decade suggest that there&#13;
has been a decline in the flexibility of the labor market. The number of&#13;
industrial workers raslgning voluntarily and the number of vacancies have both&#13;
declined , at the same tine as the average duration of unemployment and the&#13;
average duration of vacancies have per3istently increased. There has also been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-=143 -&#13;
a distinct decline in the geographical mobility of the labor force". It is&#13;
in this context that we can understand Miller's information (1978, p.4) that&#13;
44,000 workers were in in-plant training in March 1978 as an alternative to lay-&#13;
off, 59,000 were in institutional training, 52,000 were in public service&#13;
13/&#13;
employment, and 40,000 handicapped were in sheltered employment.      This is a&#13;
substantial effort called forth in large part by, and aimed at mitigating the&#13;
underlying inflexibility of, the labor market.&#13;
Turning to specific policies which may be expected to help adjustment,&#13;
let us look briefly at Millen's account (1978) of a plant closure in Sweden.&#13;
In the first place, lay-offs require pre-notification of as much as six months&#13;
if more than 100 workers are affected. Usually the County Labor Board holds&#13;
an information meeting when the notice is official and it may decide to set up&#13;
a consultation group consisting of representatives of itself, the employer,&#13;
the employees and the municipality. During the period of cutback a state grant&#13;
can be made to cover 75 percent of the wage costs, and in these circumstances&#13;
all employees are entitled to training or resettlement grants. Bankrupt firms&#13;
can receive grants for up to half the wage costs for up to twelve months. Orders&#13;
for goods from the central government can be placed with the firm. All these&#13;
measures postpone the period of closure or extend it, thus giving the Labor&#13;
Board more time to find alternative employment for workers and to create new&#13;
jobs in the area. It appears from the example Millen gives of a particular&#13;
13/ Comparable numbers in the United States would be 1 million in subsidized&#13;
in-plant training, 1.4 million workers in institutional training organized&#13;
by the state, 1.2 million in specially created public sector jobs, and&#13;
0.9 million handicapped people in sheltered employment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 144 -&#13;
closure that the Labor Board is reasonably successful in finding alternative&#13;
employment for the employees, although it is, of course, unclear how much of&#13;
the unemployment is displaced on to entrants into the labor force and other&#13;
marginal groups.&#13;
What Sweden has created for the management of lay-offs is a com-&#13;
bination of subsidies to firms, a generalization of the type of special programs&#13;
to help severely-affected communities that we discussed in the preceding section,&#13;
and extensive direct assistance to worker mobility. Two questions arise. Firstly,&#13;
What is the efficiency of the approach? The answer seems to be that it is un-&#13;
certain whether the social costs of adjustment are lowered. The key factors&#13;
will be whether job search is significantly less efficient without actual&#13;
unemployment and whether the output of the workers in the subsidized jobs has&#13;
economic value. Secondly, Is the approach generalizable? The answer is probably&#13;
"no". It demands an extensive bureaucracy; trust among local and national&#13;
governments, trade unions and employers; a willingness to spend a great deal of&#13;
money; and, perhaps most important, a realization that the subsidies to the&#13;
firms are indeed strictly limited in time to the adjustment period.- Against&#13;
this, it must be recognized that some elements, such as the extended notice of&#13;
lay-offs.are readily transferable elsewhere   (and indeed already exist in&#13;
14/&#13;
legislation in most European countries).&#13;
Of the policies directly aimed at the workers, training takes the&#13;
largest proportion of the funds. Government-funded training programs also&#13;
14/ Legislation demanding lengthy notification of expected lay-offs exists in&#13;
the United Kingdom. The process of complex negotiations over substantial&#13;
lay-offs is E feature of the situation in West Germany (Millen 1978).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 145 -&#13;
15/&#13;
exist in the United States (Frank 1977, pp.90-4), and in most European countries.&#13;
A recent study by Ashenfelter (1978) on the United States' Manpower Development&#13;
and Training Act concluded that there was a significantly positive effect on&#13;
earnings, giving a rate of return of about 10 percent for males but considerably&#13;
more for females. Frank (1977 pp.91-2) concurs that the benefits of these&#13;
programs appear to have been strongly positive, but also indicates that most&#13;
research shows that on-the-job training is significantly more effective than&#13;
institutional training. This particular finding may justify the Swedish willing-&#13;
ness to subsidize such training on a very large scale (90,000 workers in 1976/77).&#13;
However, it is unclear whether training of workers who would otherwise be laid&#13;
off, as is happening in Sweden,  is quite the same in effect as more general&#13;
subsidization of in-plant training. The National Labor Market Board (May 1978,&#13;
p.10) estimates that some 75 percent of its trainees obtain jobs within three&#13;
months and almost 90 percent within six months. Since most of those trained&#13;
(except for those in in-plant training) were previously outside the labor force&#13;
or unemployed, it regards these statistics as an indication of a considerable&#13;
success. This seems plausible, but information is, of course, lacking on&#13;
the extent to which all that is happening_is a change in the order in the job queue.&#13;
15/ While not itself enormous, the European Social Fund is an important source&#13;
of funds for training. Indeed, about 90 percent of its funds, which are&#13;
currently running at a little over 600 million European Units of Account&#13;
per annum, support training (Commission of the European Communities October&#13;
1978, especially Annex 1). Since the retraining aim of the Fund was established&#13;
in the context of a desire to reduce the costs of trade integration, the Fund&#13;
represents an attempt to use training as an essential part of the adjustment&#13;
process.   (See on this Braun 1973, pp.201-8; Frank 1977,pp.127-8).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 146 -&#13;
In Germany too there has been an increase in the training budget and training&#13;
activities in 1975 covered 120,000 unemployed workers (Millen 1978, p.9).&#13;
Interestingly, the absolute number is barely more than that in the equivalent&#13;
category in Sweden.&#13;
Training seems to be of great value. In the first place, it is a&#13;
direct way of avoiding the Stolper-Samuelson effect of trade with developing&#13;
countries, since it involves a wider distribution of human capital. Secondly,&#13;
it may go some way towards directly offsetting the weaknesses of the poorer&#13;
regions of developed countries. Thirdly, it is likely to be particularly&#13;
important for women, who are so heavily represented in the vulnerable industries.&#13;
Since women are often relatively immobile inter-regionally, training may help&#13;
to increase their mobility inter-sectorally. Ashenfelter's evidence that the&#13;
return on training of women was higher than that for men is particularly encourag-&#13;
ing. However, training can hardly be a panacea. The extent to which individuals&#13;
can be transformed later in life is presumably limited: human beings are not as&#13;
malleable as metal. Furthermore, Wolter (1977) notes that the key characteristic&#13;
of industries in wihich developed countries have a comparative advantage is the&#13;
presence of very highly skilled labor, and such people are not likely to be&#13;
created out of those laid off in import-competing industries. Nonetheless, all&#13;
industries employ people of lower skill levels, and training, by increasing the&#13;
16/&#13;
flexibility of the labor force, can help to ease the pain of adjustment.&#13;
16/ There is the issue of whether governments should subsidize retraining.&#13;
Capital market imperfections certainly justify loans. Outright sub-&#13;
sidization of retraining of displaced workers may be regarded as an&#13;
appropriate part of a policy of compensation for the losses experienced.&#13;
There may be broader income distribution objectives served by such sub-&#13;
sidization.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 147 -&#13;
Direct assistance to mobility through grants and arrangements to&#13;
help with the sale of houses is common. In Sweden the bulk of such assistance&#13;
goes for removal grants. Assistance with the costs of job search and re-&#13;
location is a part of the United States Trade Act of 1974, but the facilities&#13;
have been rather little used. One reason is that the administrative process&#13;
of certifying     eligibility has taken about six months, by which time more&#13;
than 70 percent of the laid off workers are already re-employed. It may also&#13;
be the case that, given the fairly generous levels of topped-up unemployment&#13;
benefits, workers prefer to wait in the hope of getting their earlier jobs&#13;
back. This seems to be particularly relevant for workers in highly-paid&#13;
industries like steel and automobile manufacturing. Under the Department of&#13;
Defense's program for economic adjustment,workers are also protected against&#13;
capital losses on the sale of their homes (Frank 1977, pp.67-8). All governments&#13;
can assist with the removal of impediments to mobility such as extensive rent&#13;
controls or non-transferability of pensions. Thus, the United Kingdom provides&#13;
more than 40 percent of its housing, largely for the working class, through&#13;
local councils. Rents are below market levels and mobility among areas is&#13;
difficult. Countries in which private pensions are an important part of security&#13;
for old-age but where portability-is imperfect, face an important obstacle to&#13;
mobility as well.&#13;
In sum, much of what is being done in the area of labor market policy&#13;
has nothing to do with increasing adjustment, and is indeed designed to maintain&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 148 -&#13;
existing employment. Nonetheless, there are potentially valuable policies.&#13;
Training, for example, seems to provide a good return and to be a useful&#13;
part of adjustment policy. Programs to assist relocation may also be valuable,&#13;
although they are generally very small in relation to other expenditures in&#13;
the labor market. Indeed, it may make better sense to concentrate on removing&#13;
already existing obstacles to mobility, of which there are several. Sweden's&#13;
approach to the management of sizeable layoffs may be useful, but it is probably&#13;
not replicable in countries less used to cooperation among employers, unions&#13;
and local and central government. In all, whatever the value of labor market&#13;
policy, in most other countries it will probably never be possible to employ it&#13;
as actively as in Sweden. Furthermore, it must be remembered that the&#13;
effect of such policy can be perverse, as longer-run trends in Sweden may&#13;
indicate. Thus, if workers become more and more unwilling to adjust their&#13;
aspirations as the state increasingly accepts them as binding constraints on&#13;
policy, labor market flexibility will steadily decline and ever-growing resort&#13;
to ad hoc measures will be needed merely to preserve the status quo of employ-&#13;
ment.&#13;
d.   Compensation and Income Maintenance&#13;
In a market economy compensation is the obvious way of dealing with&#13;
the problem of the unequal distribution of the benefits and costs arising from&#13;
any particular change. If compensation could be truly "lump-sum" and have&#13;
no effect on efficiency, an economic problem would not be created. However,&#13;
it cannot be, and thus there are costs associated with any given scheme of&#13;
compensation. This brings out a key difference between compensation as an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 149 -&#13;
adjustment policy and those we have already considered: whereas&#13;
the other adjustment measures can have direct economic benefits and reduce the&#13;
social costs of adjustment (although the reverse is probably true of many of&#13;
the examples we have considered), compensation will normally affect only the&#13;
private costs and political acceptability-of change. But even so, if compen-&#13;
sation is a policy alternative to protection, which itself imposes efficiency&#13;
costs, it can increase aggregate, unweighted,social welfare via its effect on&#13;
policy choice.  This emphasizes the importance of allowing for political effects&#13;
in judging the economic consequences of policy in controversial areas like trade&#13;
(Corden 1974, p.112).&#13;
What is the relationship between a compensation program and one&#13;
designed to provide income security? If perfect compensation could be provided&#13;
for all losses, perfect income security would- also be available. However, in&#13;
a world of uncertainty the two concepts diverge. Income security is provided&#13;
by insurance: the recipient is guaranteed a certain level of income irrespective&#13;
of the state of the world. Since one cannot know the state of the world in&#13;
any period except by experiencing it, this entails periodic payment to bring&#13;
the level of income up to dhe desired level. If the insurance scheme guaranteed&#13;
the recipient his expected income, he would be fully compensated for change&#13;
but in a way that removed all incentive to work. The problem is, of course,&#13;
that states of the world are not independent of action, which in turn will be&#13;
affected by the knowledge that the initial expected income is guaranteed irr-&#13;
espective of action. For this reason all actual income security schemes fall&#13;
well short of guaranteeing original expected income and thus do not compensate&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 150 -&#13;
fully for economic change. In a world of uncertainty compensation might be&#13;
defined as that sum which leaves the recipient indifferent between maintaining&#13;
his original expected income in his original employment and the best income he&#13;
can expect from new employment, taking into account the cost of search and any&#13;
insurance and welfare payments available in the interim period. It will be&#13;
clear that such compensation does not provide security because no allowance is&#13;
made for the possibiliity of being wrong about the income one can expect to&#13;
obtain and the costs of search. However, it is also worth noting that the&#13;
compensation sum is likely to be larger than the present value of the difference&#13;
between the two income streams to the extent that the recipient is not in-&#13;
different to risk.&#13;
d. i. Compensation and income security for workers&#13;
For some time it has been accepted in the developed countries that&#13;
the risk of a fall in income should be "socialized". This applies irrespective&#13;
of the cause of the fall and in particular of whether the fall is the consequence&#13;
of unforeseeable and uncontrollable change or not. The loss of a job is offset&#13;
by the payment of unemployment benefit, under which a sum based on prior re-&#13;
muneration is paid on a regular basis, usually subject to a number of eligibility&#13;
restrictions and a time limit. Unemployed workers and their families are also&#13;
eligible for various welfare benefits. In the United States, unemployment&#13;
benefits themselves are rather low. Frank (1977, p.95) estimates that average&#13;
benefits as a percentage of covered wage levels were only 38 percent in February&#13;
1975, and these vary by state. Frank judges that, apart from food stamps, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 151 -&#13;
other welfare programs of the United States are not particularly relevant&#13;
to well-paid workers (Ibid., p.97), but this may not be true for the less well-&#13;
paid and often female employees in firms affected by imports from developing&#13;
countries.  For the latter Aid for Dependent Children (AFDC) could be valuable.&#13;
In addition, Frank (1977, pp. 97-109) shows that union contracts often&#13;
provide additional benefits. In Europe social security is much&#13;
more generous than in the United States, both for unemployment and more generally.&#13;
Millen (1978, p.9) suggests that unemployment benefit is on average equal to about&#13;
80 percent of the wage in Germany, and from what we have discovered, the same is&#13;
true of all the countries of North West Europe (i.e. France, the Benelux countries,&#13;
and Scandinavia, in addition to Germany). Flemming (1976, p.60) indicates&#13;
that the ratio of total benefits to after-tax income in employment for a&#13;
worker with a wife and two children in the United Kingdom in 1973 was over&#13;
70 percent, if he had been earning the average waRe. The ratio would fall as income rnse.&#13;
In relation to the goal of compensating for specific economic changes&#13;
and to the issue of incentives, all existing schemes for assistance to the&#13;
unemployed suffer from defects. One problem is that, being based on regular&#13;
payments, the schemes reduce the incentive to find work, thus raising the&#13;
"natural" rate of unemployment and presumably increasing the social costs of&#13;
adjustment. Secondly, they do not provide full compensation for the costs of&#13;
being laid off, and indeed are not supposed to. A particularly important fact&#13;
is that they do not offset a reduction in earnings themselves. Thus the&#13;
failure to compensate tends to be larger the higher the initial income, since&#13;
those who earn high incomes, are unlikely to obtain equally profitable jobs&#13;
again (Jacobson 1978, especially Tables 6 and 7) and welfare benefits are&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 152 -&#13;
usually progressive. Because benefits are usually progressive many of those in&#13;
industries vulnerable to imports from developing countries would not be so badly off,&#13;
were it not for the fact that their jobs are usually neither stable nor full-time&#13;
and this impairs eligibility for unemployment benefit in most systems. Finally,&#13;
there is no special consideration for those laid off because of trade: this&#13;
may be necessary to mollify political resistance.&#13;
Programs exist that solve some of these problems. Under the trade&#13;
adjustment program of the United States there is special compensation for those&#13;
who are laid off from firms significantly affected by imports. (Incidentally,&#13;
once it is determined that imports contribute "importantly" to the loss of&#13;
jobs, which does not mean that they are the predominant or even the largest&#13;
single cause, no attempt is, or can be, made to distinguish between imports,&#13;
productivity growth or other causes. All workers are eligible). In the 1974&#13;
Trade Act the payment to a displaced worker is 70 percent of his weekly wage&#13;
up to a maximum payment of the average weekly wage in manufacturing for a&#13;
period of up to 52 weeks. The period is twice as long as that provided for&#13;
normal unemployment benefit and the payment is much higher. Workers in training&#13;
and older workers are entitled to still bnger periods of benefit. If a worker&#13;
earns additional income, he is entitled to keep 50 percent of it until his&#13;
total income (including the readjustment allowance) equals 80 percent of his&#13;
average weekly wage or 130 percent of the average weekly wage in manufacturing,&#13;
whichever is less, and thereafter the marginal tax rate exceeds 100 percent until&#13;
he has lost the entire readjustment benefit. (The marginal tax rate on the&#13;
readjustment benefit alone is 100 percent, but to this must be added normal&#13;
17/&#13;
income tax).    The program has a number of defects both from the point of&#13;
17/ For a discussion of United States benefits to workers see Frank (1977) pp.63-4.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 153 -&#13;
view of efficiency and as a source of compensation. Firstly, the program&#13;
does not provide full compensation and this inadequacy increases the higher&#13;
the original income. (Bale (1976) shows that there was a significant short-&#13;
fall.) Secondly, because of the taxation of benefits, the program creates a&#13;
significant disincentive effect. Finally, and most important, because of&#13;
administrative delays of six months or more most workers are already employed&#13;
again when they receive payment.   Thus, the program appears to them as a&#13;
source of a single back-dated lump sum. Since a substantial proportion of&#13;
applications for eligibility are rejected (currently about 55 percent payment&#13;
is probably     not anticipated and has, therefore, rather a small effect on&#13;
incentives. However, for the very same reason-,workers are unlikely to consider&#13;
the readjustment allowance as any kind of compensation at the time of dis-&#13;
missal or before. It is too uncertain. Thus, the program must fail to fulfil&#13;
what is its primary function,namely   to encourage "exit" rather than "voice"&#13;
among those being or expecting to be made redundant by imports.&#13;
Another interesting approach is that of providing lump sum redundancy&#13;
payments or severance payments. In the United States Frank (1977, pp.102-3)&#13;
shows that such payments are a part of many union contracts. The United Kingdom&#13;
has developed a national system of redundancy payments. Under the Redundancy&#13;
Payments Act of 1965 any redundant worker is entitled to a payment of a number&#13;
of weeks' gross pay varying according to the age of the employee at the time&#13;
18/&#13;
of dismissal and the length of service.     Payments are made by the employer&#13;
18/ More precisely, payment is half a week's pay for each year of service between&#13;
18 and 21, one week's pay for each year of service between 22 and 40, and&#13;
one week's pay thereafter, subject to a maximum of 20 years, a minimum&#13;
period of two years, and a maximum payment of E 3,000 in 1977. (Department&#13;
of Employment Gazette, Volume 86, Number 9 (September 1978) p.1032).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 154 -&#13;
who is entitled to a refund of half the payment from the Redundancy Fund,&#13;
which is itself financed by contributions from employers. Between 1966&#13;
and 1973 total redundancy payments under the act were b 545 million and the&#13;
average payment was b 271 per worker (Jackson 1975, p.49). In 1975/76 the&#13;
average payment was E 570, equal to about 19 percent of the average annual&#13;
earnings of full-time adult workers and more than 20 percent of the earnings&#13;
of those actually made redundant. By the end of 1977 the average payment had&#13;
19/&#13;
risen-to just over E 600 per worker.     If one considers that wages in the&#13;
United Kingdom are about half those in the United States, this latter sum&#13;
is equivalent to B1,200,which is a significant proportion of the $2,750 we&#13;
had estimated as the private cost of displacement of trade-affected wurkers&#13;
after all benefits had been received (page 85 above).     Since the welfare&#13;
system is more generous in the United Kingdom than in the United States it is&#13;
possible that redundancy payments go quite a long way towards making full&#13;
compensation for job loss except perhaps for those with very well-paid initial&#13;
jobs. The latter are not able to get such adequate welfare and unemployment&#13;
benefits and usually experience a considerable fall in earnings. However, to&#13;
make up for this disadvantage specially high redundancy payments have sometimes&#13;
been made available. Thus, the Economist (2-8th December 1978, p.114) reports&#13;
that workers in the British Steel Corporation with five years' service had&#13;
been given redundancy pay of E 5,000 per man, financed by the government, the&#13;
EEC steel funds, and BSC itself.&#13;
Lump sum redundancy payments have a number of major advantages as a&#13;
form of assistance. Firstly, they do not affect the decision about work&#13;
following redundancy, except to the extent that by providing funds they can&#13;
19/ Data derived from Department of Employment Gazette, various issues.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 155 -&#13;
encourage a worker to remain unemployed in the hope of getting his former&#13;
job back, especially if it was highly paid. Secondly, the money is&#13;
immediately available, so that he can see that compensation will be made.&#13;
Thirdly, the employer bears half the cost directly, and therefore faces part&#13;
of the cost of redundancy, which is considerable from the social point of&#13;
view, especially if there are generous unemployment and welfare benefits.&#13;
Against this it should be noted that there are also potential costs. Thus, the&#13;
existence of redundancy payments can encourage revolving door employment, although&#13;
the length of service provisions in the United Kingdom scheme should minimize&#13;
this. In addition, there are effects on the queue-of those willing to leave&#13;
(Department of Employment September 1978,-p.1033), although the weakening of&#13;
Last-In-First-Out hiring systems may actually increase efficiency. The cost&#13;
to the employers of contributions to the Redundancy Fund is presumably shifted&#13;
forward in large part and thus creates no significant problems. In all,&#13;
redundancy payments seem to be an extremely appropriate form for compensation&#13;
of workers affected by economic change, whether general or trade related.&#13;
d. ii. Compensation for capitalists&#13;
The idea of compensating owners of capital for changes in the value&#13;
of their capital is very much more controversial than that of providing security&#13;
to, or compensation for, workers. The argument is that owners of capital are&#13;
expected to bear risks and that if in their personal capacities they become&#13;
poor, the general welfare system will take care of them. However, there do&#13;
exist reasons for compensating capitalists. An economic argument is that the&#13;
state shares in gains through its taxation, but it shares in losses only if a&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 156 -&#13;
company is larSe and diversified enough to have gains elsewhere, against&#13;
which the losses can be offset. Thus, small, undiversified companies are&#13;
at a relative disadvantage from this point of view. If firms are extremely risk-&#13;
averse and this prevents them from undertaking projects which ard valuable&#13;
from the social point -of view, there is also a case for compensating some&#13;
losses. However, the major argument for compensation is, as we have noted,&#13;
a political one, namely, the strength of opposition by the owners of fixed&#13;
capital to trade liberalization and the need to buy this opposition out.&#13;
Whatever the theory, practice is clear. In many countries it has&#13;
become normal to nationalize what are, in effect, worthless assets and thus&#13;
compensate the owners for whatever it was that made the assets worthless.&#13;
Recent nationalizations in Europe of steel and shipbuilding firms have this&#13;
characteristic, although unfortunately we do not have adequate information on&#13;
the value of compensation implicit in the purchase prices. Subsidies to private&#13;
firms are, in effect, compensation for losses caused by economic change. More&#13;
directly relevant -are payments that have been made to persuade firms to scrap&#13;
existing assets of low but positive value as an alternative to protection.&#13;
Thus, under the 1959 Cotton Industry Act in -the United Kingdom,fixed compensatory&#13;
amounts were made available to firms prepared to scrap equipment (Miles 1968,&#13;
pp.49-53). There was a premium rate for those prepared to leave the industry&#13;
altogether, a standard rate for those scrapping machines in use, and a discount&#13;
rate for those scrapping idle equipment and equipment in closed mills. In all,&#13;
b 17 million was paid under the Act and 48 percent of spinning spindles, 27&#13;
percent of doubling spindles and 38 percent of looms were scrapped (Ibid., Tables&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 157 -&#13;
4.4 and 4.5). In Japan, also, compensation has been paid to those scrapping&#13;
existing capacity in textiles (Kojima 1973, p.256). However, Kojima notes&#13;
that, in fact, overall capacity and efficiency increased, so that Government&#13;
subsidies went not to a reduction in the size of the industry but rather to&#13;
its modernization.&#13;
d. iii. -Conclusion&#13;
The idea of compensating either workers or capitalists fully for the&#13;
consequences of a change is inevitably controversial and raises issues from&#13;
the philosophical to the purely administrative. The issues are worthy of&#13;
attention simply because compensation as we have defined it seems to be a&#13;
direct and sensible way of dealing with the adjustment problem in a market&#13;
economy. Moreover, given the existence of programs to ensure income security&#13;
the ideal method seems to be the provision of a lump sum broadly in line with&#13;
practice in the United Kingdom.&#13;
e.   Anticip-ation and the Provision of Information&#13;
It is sometimes argued that adjustment policy should be "anticipatory".&#13;
One suggestion is to provide information on expected changes in capacity through-&#13;
out the world (Franko, October 1978, p.16). As he says, "In the absence of advance&#13;
warning, structural adjustment is necessarily a surprise and a disruption which,&#13;
to those affected, makes protection look much less costly than a market solution&#13;
of sudden disappearance" (Ibid.) It seems clear that information is valuable,and,&#13;
having some of the characteristics of a "public good", is unlikely to be supplied&#13;
adequately. However, if examined more closely it will become unclear whether&#13;
the provision of information by public authorities is either feasible or useful.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 158 -&#13;
Let us consider feasibility. The inaccuracy of projections of the&#13;
exports of developing countries is notorious. Consider only the vast dis-&#13;
crepancy between what was expected for the 1960s and what happened (Balassa&#13;
May 1978, p.6). It may be argued that in the case of such industries as&#13;
chemicals or steel, surprises are less likely to occur because plants have to&#13;
be built and that takes time. Moreover, because the firms in the developed&#13;
countries are large they should be able to obtain all the required information&#13;
on capacity expansion and presumably already do so. Nonetheless, even if the&#13;
information were available, exports remain unpredictable because in such sectors&#13;
they are usually the product of temporary surpluses created by fluctuations in&#13;
supply and demand. Thus, very recently,Indian exports of steel grew from&#13;
nothing to well over a million tons and have now fallen again. Nobody predicted&#13;
this, or could have done so. In other sectors, such as clothing or footwear,&#13;
or electronics assembly, new capacity can be put up so rapidly that projections&#13;
are useless. The key factor is not even comparative advantage, but essentially&#13;
unpredictable changes in the commercial policy of developed and developing&#13;
countries. Thus, most projections of the exports of developing countries are&#13;
likely to prove of little value to the firms that will be affected.&#13;
Feasibility is not the only problem. Unfortunately, in the world of&#13;
"exit" or "voice" information is a double-edged weapon. If firms know that&#13;
there is nothing they can do to change the rules of the game, all information&#13;
must be useful. However, if they know that the rules can be changed,. and that&#13;
is certainly true for trade with developing countries, projections will give them&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 159 -&#13;
extra time to organize a protectionist lobby and obtain what they desire in&#13;
advance of market penetration. At least at present something has to happen&#13;
before protection is imposed. Obviously, even this works both ways. It is&#13;
possible that information will reduce the panic created by completely un-&#13;
expected market inroads. Nonetheless, we must be aware that, as with many&#13;
of the other policies we have discussed, advance information can lead to a&#13;
better organized resistance.&#13;
D. Composite Adjustment Policies&#13;
There exist ways to integrate these independent elements and we investi-&#13;
gate thre approaches: trade-related, industry-oriented, and economy-wide programs.&#13;
Under each, one or two examples are chosen, but it is, of course, impossible&#13;
to examine all the various policies that ingenious governments of close to&#13;
twenty countries have thought up in the past twenty years.&#13;
a.   Trade-Related Adjustment Programs&#13;
a. i. The United States of America&#13;
The program was initiated in the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 and ex-&#13;
panded in the Trade Act of 1974. Because of excessively severe restrictions&#13;
on eligibility the "trade adjustment assistance program of the 1962 Trade&#13;
Expansion Act was an abysmal failure" (Frank 1977, p.57). and for this reason&#13;
the program was substantially liberalized and extended in the 1974 Act. We&#13;
have already considered the major components of the program, which includes&#13;
technical assistance, loans and loan guarantees for firms attempting to re-&#13;
structure their operations; payments-to displaced workers; assistance to worker&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 160 -&#13;
mobility and training; assistance to affected communities; and provision for&#13;
monitoring production, consumption and employment in industries that are com-&#13;
petitive with imports (Frank 1977, pp.63-8). Of particular importance in the&#13;
1974 Act were changes in eligibility and administration. Thus, the criterion&#13;
for adjustment assistance is merely that imports contribute "importantly" to&#13;
the loss of jobs, which apparently does not require either that imports be the&#13;
predominant or even largest single cause (Ibid., p.61). Furthermore, the&#13;
Secretary of Labor or Conmerce is responsible for deciding eligibility for adjust-&#13;
ment assistance and must act within sixty days, while escape clause relief is the&#13;
responsibility of the International Trade Commission, which has up to six months&#13;
to make its determination (Ibid.). In sum, this is an extremely comprehensive&#13;
trade-oriented program. It does not include a broad regional or industrial&#13;
approach, but otherwise contains all the obvious components of adjustment policy.&#13;
If we focus on the assistance provided under the 1974 Trade Act, we&#13;
observe that it is workers who have received the bulk of the benefits. Between&#13;
April 3rd, 1975 and the end of May, 1978 a total of $463 million had been paid&#13;
to 335,000 workers in Trade Readjustment Allowances (Department of Labor un-&#13;
published information). While we do not have information on the dollar value&#13;
of payments under worker mobility and training allowances, it is clear that&#13;
these must have been very small, since by the end of May, 1978 only 1,075&#13;
applications for a job search allowance and 557 applications for a job realloca-&#13;
tion allowance had been approved, and 9,843 workers had been referred to training.&#13;
By the end of July, 1978 $67.6 million had been given to sixty-three firms in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 161 -&#13;
financial assistance, of which $45.4 million was in direct loans and $22-.1&#13;
million was in loan guarantees. $1.3 million had been granted to 80 firms&#13;
for technical assistance in developing adjustment proposals (Department of&#13;
Commerce unpublished information). Because of the difficulty of proving that&#13;
an area qualifies under the criteria of the Trade Act, the Department of&#13;
Commerce encourages affected communities to apply under other programs, such&#13;
as those established under the Public Works and Economic Development Act of&#13;
1965 (Department-of Commerce January 1978, pp.4-5). In order to provide a&#13;
point of comparison, it may be noted that under the 1962 Act only about 52,000&#13;
workers had received $72 million during its entire history (entirely between&#13;
1969 and 1975) (Neumann 1978, p.109), and 19 firms received about $45 million&#13;
(Frank 1977, pp.49-53). It is clear that measured in terms of numbers helped&#13;
and expenditure, the 1974 Act has already been much more successful than the&#13;
earlier program.&#13;
What does assistance mean to those affected and what are the problems?&#13;
For workers the average amount received has been $1,382 for an average period&#13;
Df 24.9 weeks. 24 percent of the workers were in primary metal industries&#13;
(mostly steel), 20 percent were in the manufacture of transportation equipment&#13;
(largely automobiles), 14 percent were in apparel, 10 percent were in electrical&#13;
and electronic machinery, and 10 percent were in-leather and leather products.&#13;
It is clear that much of the benefit has gone-to industries for which the&#13;
leveloping countries are an insignificant factor. One reason is that unions&#13;
iave played a vital role in obtaining assistance for their members, so that&#13;
the relatively-well-organized steel and automobile workers have done exceptionally&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 162 -&#13;
well. Thus a report by the Comptroller General of the United States (May&#13;
1977, p.13) notes that in the first year of operation over 80 percent of&#13;
petitions were filed by unions, although in 1975 about 65 percent of un-&#13;
employed manufacturing workers were not union members. Another report by the&#13;
Comptroller Gcneral (January 1978, p.8) notes that in the case of automobile&#13;
workers a large part of the benefits went simply to repay company/union supple-&#13;
mental unemployment benefit funds. Furthermore, at least in the case of such&#13;
relatively well-paid workers there is negligible incentive to train for a job&#13;
elsewhere (Ibid., pp.5-8).&#13;
Turning to firms, it is important to note that the program is essentially&#13;
geared towards the needs of small firms, since the maximum direct loan is $1&#13;
million and the maximum guaranteed loan is $3 million (with the Department of&#13;
Commerce guaranteeing 90 percent of the face value). The interest rate on&#13;
direct loans is equal to the yield on U.S. securities of comparable maturity&#13;
plus a small charge for administration and losses. Interest rates on guaranteed&#13;
loans are restricted to the maximum rate which the financial institution may&#13;
charge on its Small Business Act guaranteed loans. Given the precarious situation&#13;
of the firms and the fact that they bear 10 percent of the risk, it appears&#13;
that banks are generally unwilling to lend on these terms, which is why most of&#13;
the assistance has come in the form of direct loans. In 1977 82 percent of the&#13;
112 certified firms were in footwear, apparel or handbag manufacture. There&#13;
were 49 footwear firms, 28 apparel firms and 15 handbag manufacturers (Department&#13;
of Commerce January 1978, p.2). Thus, in the case of assistance to firms it&#13;
has been those affected by developing countries that have been the main beneficiaries.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 163 -&#13;
A key issue is that of administration. By its nature it is necessary&#13;
to start by discovering whether imports are indeed an important cause of lay-&#13;
offs (for workers) or of a decline in sales or output (for firms). This entails&#13;
20/&#13;
certification of eligibility by the Departments of Labor or Commerce, respectively.&#13;
Thereafter, workers applv for their benefits and firms present their program of&#13;
adjustment, usually following receipt of a report from a (government-financed)&#13;
20/ The problem of defining eligibility is a difficult one and the decision in&#13;
any particular case is somewhat arbitrary as are the criteria themselves.&#13;
For firms the Department of Commerce (n.d., p.2) says "If the firm's sales&#13;
or production have decreased, if it has laid off or is about to lay off&#13;
workers (or has significantly reduced their work hours), and if imports&#13;
of "like or directly competitive" articles have been an important reason&#13;
for the problems, the firms have a good chance of being certified". In&#13;
the case of labor the same sort of approach is followed, except that there&#13;
has to be evidence of a significant separation of workers, (i.e. 50 people&#13;
or 5 percent of the work-force). In the process of examining the claim,&#13;
the customers of the firm are approached to discover whether they have&#13;
switched their purchases to imports, which is very unpopular with the&#13;
affected firm when it is workers' certification that is at stake. In the&#13;
case of commodities, the prices of imports are examined. Obviously, all&#13;
these steps involve very rough and ready judgement. A report by the&#13;
Comptroller General (May 31, 1977) points out that problems of consistent&#13;
definition have arisen in determining what are "like or competitive"&#13;
articles, when imports have increased, and whether imports have contributed&#13;
importantly to worker separations. It is clear that arbitrariness both&#13;
in criteria and their applications, as well as delays in execution, are in-&#13;
herent in the program. Separating the trade-affected sheep from the goats&#13;
is inevitably a complex and tortuous business.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 164 -&#13;
consultant. Thus, the process is inevitably time-consuming and prevents the&#13;
various decision-makers from taking the program into account at the time of&#13;
dislocation or displacement itself.   This problem is exacerbated by the fact&#13;
that, as might be expected, many applications for certification are denied.&#13;
In the case of workers a major reason for delay has been a far greater number&#13;
of applications than anticipated. Thus, accordingly to information we received,&#13;
the backlog of cases built up steadily after the beginning of the program in&#13;
April 1975. While the processing of applications for certification is supposed&#13;
to take 60 days, six months was usual and up to a year not uncommon. In the&#13;
first year only 25 percent of applications for certification were processed&#13;
within 60 days (Comptroller General of the United States May 1977, pp.37-8),&#13;
and performance deteriorated throughout the year. After certification, workers&#13;
still had an average of 12 weeks to wait between the time of application by&#13;
each individual and payment (Comptroller General of the United States May 9th,&#13;
1978, p.ii), at least in Pennsylvania. In all "an average of over 65 weeks elapsed&#13;
from the time workers were separated or put on a reduced work schedule to the&#13;
time workers received the first trade readjustment allowance payment". (Ibid.).&#13;
Furthermore, only 42 percent of all cases led to certification. Thus, the process&#13;
was both lengthy and uncertain, althbugh there have been recent improvements.&#13;
The great majority of workers had already obtained employment again, often in&#13;
the original industry, by the time certification had taken place, let alone&#13;
actual receipt of the money. In the case of firms, the Department of Commerce&#13;
estimates that certification is carried out within 60 days, but the entire&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 165 -&#13;
process takes between six and twelve months (Department of Commerce n.d.).&#13;
The length of time taken to process applications, combined&#13;
with the uncertainty about the outcome, are extremely disadvantageous&#13;
features of the program viewed as an attempt to help workers readjust or to&#13;
"buy off" protection. Moreover, these features are inherent in a program that&#13;
requires case-by-case analysis of the consequences of something that has&#13;
already happened. Any trade related program will have this feature unless it&#13;
also includes the possibility of pre-certifying a whole industry as eligible&#13;
for benefits instead of individual firms. Nonetheless, administration can be&#13;
improved. A possibility is to require longer notice of lay offs by firms and&#13;
application for certification at the time such notice is given. There are&#13;
additional defects in the program's conception. One problem is that firms&#13;
are assisted only to invest anew. However, it is likely that many of the firms&#13;
will continue to be in great difficulty and this process will maintain the&#13;
protectionist lobby in being. - /     Another point is that many of the loans are&#13;
made for working capital. If the firm does, in fact, fail, all the Government&#13;
has done is to bail out some of the original creditors. More seriously, there&#13;
is no assistance to indirectly-affected firms, such as producers of finished&#13;
leather for shoe firms. Payment to workers is inadequate as compensation for&#13;
the private costs and inefficient to the extent that it is based on weekly&#13;
payments with high marginal tax rates. In all, while a program with interesting&#13;
features, it is flawed both in conception and execution, as is clear from the&#13;
failure to still the rising chorus of protectionism.&#13;
21/ The rate of failure seems to be quite high.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

a. ii. Canada&#13;
Following experience with the Canadian-American Automotive Agreement&#13;
of 1965, (of which more later), the General Adjustment Assistance Program was&#13;
created in 1968. In 1971 a special program for adjustment in the textile and&#13;
clothing industry, the Textile and Clothing Board Act, was established. In the&#13;
same year the GAAP was amended, and again in 1973 to allow assistance to virtually&#13;
any activity in the tradeable goods sector, irrespective of whether the need&#13;
for adjustment was related to Kennedy Round concessions or whether there had&#13;
been injury arising from those concessions. Any manufacturer is eligible for&#13;
assistance provided he wishes to restructure his operations to become more&#13;
competitive internationally, to exploit new trade opportunities, or to adapt&#13;
to competition from abroad that threatens serious injury.&#13;
The GAAP is very similar to the part of the United States' program&#13;
that deals with firms. Thus the Government guarantees 90 percent of a loan,&#13;
meeting the eligibility criteria if the firm is unable to obtain the loan&#13;
without such assistance. Direct loans can also be provided and the government&#13;
will pay for up to one half of the eonsultant services required to develop a'&#13;
workable proposal. The bulk of the assistance has been in the form of loan&#13;
guarantees, which had totalled almost $41 million by mid-1974. The main difference&#13;
from the United States program, especially after amendment, is the extremely&#13;
weak eligibility criteria. As a result most of the assistance went to exporters,&#13;
and, according to Frank, (1977, p.131), as of October 1971 no loans had been&#13;
approved to remedy a serious injury resulting from import competition. As far&#13;
as the workers are concerned, the only provision is that eligibility for assistance&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 167 -&#13;
requires three months' notice of layoffs, which should remedy some of the&#13;
22/&#13;
problems of the United States program.&#13;
The aims of the Canadian program are modest. Compensation and&#13;
security for unemployed workers, regional development, labor mobility, and&#13;
indeed any other possible component of adjustment policy are dealt with else-&#13;
where in the context of general, non trade-related programs. The program, like&#13;
that of the United States, does nothing for those owners of capital who are un-&#13;
able to discover a viable (or even putatively viable) adjustment strategy.&#13;
Furthermore, it seems to have done little to prevent the growth of protectionist&#13;
action, much of it directed against developing countries' exports of textiles&#13;
and clothing.&#13;
a.iii.  The Netherlands&#13;
The Dutch program for adjustment assistance is of interest for a&#13;
number of reasons: firstly, it is specifically related to trade with developing&#13;
countries, which, as we have argued, is the only feasible trade-related adjust-&#13;
ment program for the European countries. Secondly, it has been developed in the&#13;
context of an ambitious program for comprehensive restructuring of Dutch industry&#13;
of a highly interventionist type, and has been much lauded. Thus Mukherjee&#13;
(1978, p.73) states "the inter-related approach adopted by the Dutch is both&#13;
politically and in practice a strategy with a greater potential for success than&#13;
separate adjustment assistance programmes". Thirdly, in spite of Mukherjee's&#13;
encomium, that part of the program which is specifically related to the re-&#13;
structuring demanded by trade with developing countries has been a failure.&#13;
22/   Information on the Canadian program is derived from Frank (1977, pp.129-33),&#13;
and Mukherjee (1978, pp.65-8).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 168 -&#13;
The specific Dutch program was announced in 1972/3 and began in 1974/5.&#13;
It allowed for a fund of D.Fl 35 million per annum to be included in the develop-&#13;
ment assistance budget, and to be provided to Dutch firms contemplating re-&#13;
adjustment necessitated by changes in the international division of labor with&#13;
developing countries. Unlike the United States' and Canadian programs, funds&#13;
are provided not so much to break a financial constraint as simply to subsidize&#13;
the firms. Thus the government provides a grant equal to 20-25 percent of the&#13;
project cost.&#13;
As Mukherjee notes, the keynote of the program is that it is inter-&#13;
related. More precisely, in accordance with a "Supplementary Memorandum on&#13;
the Restructuring of the Netherlands Economy and Development Cooperation"&#13;
presented to the States General in 1975 (Evers et alii June 1977, pp.3-6), it&#13;
is hoped that a subsidized project will have three characteristics: (i) abandon-&#13;
ment of production of an item; (ii) modification of the production structure&#13;
so that "employment will as far as possible be maintained at the same level"&#13;
(Ibid., p.5); and (iii) construction of production capacity in developing&#13;
countries. Even if allowance is made for a relaxed interpretation in any&#13;
particular case, it will be rare that any firm will not only be abl. to ful-&#13;
fil all these criteria but be able to show it.&#13;
Whatever the cause, by the end of 1978 commitments under this program&#13;
had reached only D.F.1.57 million:, well below the sums appropriated for that&#13;
purpose. This was not because of a high level of rejections, since only about&#13;
25 percent of applications were rejected, but because of a lack of applications.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 169 -&#13;
The probability is that very few firms affected by competition from developing&#13;
countries could find projects which were product-innovating, maintained&#13;
employment, and benefitted the exports of developing countries. -Increasing&#13;
protection of the vulnerable industries may well have also discouraged applicants.&#13;
In any case, the program is being reconsidered.&#13;
aiv. Conclusion&#13;
The trade-related adjustment programs reviewed above are, apart from&#13;
that of the United States, not very ambitious in scope. The common element is&#13;
the provision of resources to firms for new investments, which are supposed&#13;
both to ensure the survival of the firms and allow imports to proceed. For reasons&#13;
we have considered above, the attempt to ensure the viability of firms which&#13;
are vulnerable to competition from developing countries, is unlikely to succeed&#13;
largely because vulnerable firms are, relatively speaking, those with weak&#13;
management producing fairly standard items, and not protected by location or&#13;
other favorable factors. In general, it appears to make more sense to compensate&#13;
firms for their losses than to encourage them (or society) to throw good money&#13;
after bad. Apart from this general defect, all the programs suffer from specific&#13;
disadvantages. However, there is one feature that all trade-related program&#13;
oriented towards individual firms pust share, namely that a procedure has to&#13;
be developed to distinguish those injured by imports from others. Not only are&#13;
the criteria arbitrary and success with individual claims correspondingly un-&#13;
certain, but the process of certification of elegibility is bound to take time.&#13;
The consequence is either that adjustment itself is delayed or that the benefits&#13;
come too late to be relevant to decision-makers. This-means that adjustment-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 170 -&#13;
assistance, especially for workers, cannot have the desired incentive effect&#13;
of mollifying protectionist sentiment and lowering the desire to retain the&#13;
job. Administration can be improved, but the delays inherent in a program&#13;
that investigates what has happened prior to providing benefits are un-&#13;
avoidable. Consequently, from the point of view of increasing the access of&#13;
imports, the approach has serious flaws.&#13;
b.    Industry-Oriented Adjustment Programs&#13;
By an "industry-oriented adjustment program" we mean much more than&#13;
just assistance to an industry. What is also included is help to factors of&#13;
production who are forced to leave and foreigners for which a particular industry&#13;
is vital. Thus the industry is just the organizing principle for assistance&#13;
as was trade in the previous section, without there being any necessary commit-&#13;
ment to its survival. Providing assistance to those affected by an industry's&#13;
decline offers certain substantial advantages. In the first place, eligibility&#13;
can be "precertified" by looking at the overall circumstances of the industry,&#13;
(for example, output, sales, employment, exports and imports), without bothering&#13;
about the situation of individual firms. This can expedite administration. In&#13;
the second place, protection is given to an entire range of producers and,&#13;
consequently, pressure for protection will be assuaged only by a program that&#13;
benefits an equally wide range of firms, whether or not they would be eligible&#13;
for firm-specific adjustment assistance. However, there are also some dis-&#13;
advantages. One is the likelihood that an industry-wide "adjustment program"&#13;
will be no more than a last-ditch defense. Another is the inevitable arbitrari-&#13;
ness in the definition of an industry, and of who is in it. There is also the&#13;
question of whether it is desirable to assist flourishing firms in a vulnerable&#13;
industry. Despite these various drawbacks the approach has merits. Consequently,&#13;
we examine a few examples of such programs, focussing largely on those which seem&#13;
to be clearly aimed at expediting adjustment in industries vulnerable to trade.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 171 -&#13;
b.i. The United Kingdom 1959 Cotton Industry Act&#13;
The decline of the Lancashire cotton textile industry over 1952-&#13;
1958 was steady. The Act of 1959 was introduced by a government that wished&#13;
to maintain a liberal policy towards imports from developing countries, and&#13;
that recognized, as did the industry, that the source of the ptoblem was&#13;
not imports alone but the loss of export markets. Thus, protection could not&#13;
be the solution (Miles, 1968, p.47). The legislation that was enacted and&#13;
executed represented in considerable part the wishes of the industry itself.&#13;
For this reason it had a strongly defensive character. Thus, in the words of&#13;
the White Paper,the object of the Act was "to bring about a reorganized and&#13;
re-equipped industry which could compete with success in the markets of the&#13;
world with the types of cloth that are wanted wherever living standards are&#13;
high" (Ibid, p. 48).    The aim was to be achieved by reducing the size of the&#13;
industry by a minimum of 50 percent in spinning and about 40 percent in&#13;
weaving and finishing and then by encouraging the remaining firms to re-equip.&#13;
The scrapping provision of the Act have already been considered.&#13;
In addition to the payment for scrapping there was compensation to employees&#13;
of a type that foreshadowed the subsequent redundancy payments sohemes of the&#13;
United Kingdom. Thus, according to agreement reached between trade associations&#13;
and unions, payments were subject to a minimum total length of service of five&#13;
years after 1945, but were otherwise solely based on age and average weekly&#13;
earnings. Thus, an operative aged 65 or more would receive 30 weeks' earnings,&#13;
while one aged 27-29 would receive only 3 weeks' earnings. The compensation&#13;
for scrapping was paid by the government and by a levy on firms in the ratio&#13;
of two to one. However, compensation for employees was financed entirely by&#13;
levies on the firms.   25 percent of re-equipment was financed by grants, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 172 -&#13;
this presumably led to some wasteful investments of little long-term&#13;
viability.&#13;
What were the consequences of the Act? 48 percent of spindles,&#13;
27 percent of doubling spindles and 38 percent of looms were scrapped, and&#13;
i17 million pounds was paid in compensation. However, E154 million of expen-&#13;
diture on re-equipment was eligible for grants, the sums paid being 25 percent&#13;
of this total (Ibid, Table 4.6). Nominally the equipment installed was only&#13;
a modest proportion of that in existence in 1965 (12.8 percent of spinning&#13;
spindles, 1.8 percent of doubling spindles, and 8.8 percent of looms) (Ibid,&#13;
Table 4.7), but this probably underestimates the true increase in capacity&#13;
e'-ce the new machines were presumably more productive than the old, and&#13;
because modifications to existing equipment are not included. Furthermore,&#13;
the scrapped machinery was presumably the least productive. Thus, it is clear&#13;
that the goals for reduction in the size of the industry were not met. More&#13;
seriously, the Act was unable to create a viable industry in the long run.&#13;
The Government itself had no idea of what a viable structure would have been,&#13;
and indeed, such was the pace of change in the industry's technology, structure&#13;
and markets, it could not have had. At the same time, since import&#13;
restrictions were in operation, there were subsidies for re-equipment (however&#13;
modestly used), and apparent opportunities for investment created by new&#13;
technology which encouraged inter alia the increasing involvement of major&#13;
fiber producers, the industry continued its existence. However, what existed&#13;
was unhealthy, as can be seen from the fact that the industry explained the&#13;
general failure to uwe the re-equipment grant to the extent expected by stating&#13;
that modernization in the absence of import controls was money "thrown away"&#13;
(Miles, .1976, p. 191). Thus the industry of the 1960s was neither viable nor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 173 -&#13;
defunct. As Miles says: "The Act failed to achieve its stated objectives&#13;
of restoring the Lancashire industry's competitive position or its profit-&#13;
ability; and the pressure for import controls, far from being removed, was&#13;
intensified and persisted throughout the 1960s." (Ibid, p. 192)&#13;
During the 1960s the Lancashire textile industry continuea to&#13;
contract, as imports expanded, along with the growth of man-made fibres and&#13;
the related expansion of knitted fabrics. The quota system grew in scope&#13;
until in 1966 global quotas were introduced on imports from all countries&#13;
outside Western Europe, North America and Australia, covering yarns, woven&#13;
fabrics and made-up goods containing more than 50 percent cotton by weight.&#13;
The effect seems to-have been in substantial measure to divert imports&#13;
towards developed countries (Ibid, Table 7.3). A report produced by the&#13;
Textiles Council in 1969 recognized the continued vulnerability of the&#13;
industry, and recommended further contraction, restructuring, and re-equipment.&#13;
However, it set itself against a repetition of the scheme to buy out surplus&#13;
capacity.  The Countil actually recommended the   replacement of quotas by&#13;
tariffs, but this never happened.   In spite of government intervention and&#13;
much structural change the industry remains neither healthy nor dead.&#13;
The full analysis of the problems of the textile industry is&#13;
obviously beyond our scope. What'is essential is to understand why the&#13;
required adjustment was not achieved either by the 1959 Act or by sub-&#13;
sequent reports, and interventions. The key point, it appears, is that the&#13;
aim has never been simply to compensate those leaving the industry or contracting&#13;
their output, while giving the market the role of determining what production&#13;
and industrial structure would be viable.   On the contrary, the aim was to&#13;
create a financially viable industry in spite of. the fact that it was unclear&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 174 -&#13;
either whether a profitable industry could be created without permanent pro-&#13;
tection or what shape it should take, if it were possible. Indeed, the problem of&#13;
defining such a viable industry was made doubly difficult by the fact that&#13;
technology, markets and competition were changing all the time. Since the&#13;
program of scrapping and contraction was viewed as a step towards creating&#13;
a viable industry, and the aim was clearly not achieved, policy became simply&#13;
and, in general, increasingly protectionist. However, this does not mean that&#13;
in another context, namely, one in which government is prepared to see the&#13;
industry disappear (although it is, of course, unlikely to come to that),&#13;
subsidies for scrapping equipment and exit from the industry by firms as well&#13;
as compensation to workers are not appropriate and useful.&#13;
b.ii. Japanese textile and other industries&#13;
According to Kojima (1973, p. 256) government intervention in&#13;
textiles began with the Textile Structural Adjustment Law of 1956 and the&#13;
amended law of 1964 and 1967. "Those laws aimed at scrapping old, inefficient&#13;
spinning mills and building new, more efficient mills" (Ibid). Government&#13;
money was provided to compensate those scrapping old facilities. However,&#13;
as we have noted above, while new spinning capacity was limited, its&#13;
superior efficiency meant that production actually expanded. Government&#13;
compensation increased following a law of 1971 introduced to deal with the&#13;
effects of the United States-Japan textile agreement (Namiki, 1973, p. 261).&#13;
The Government was prepared to pay 100 percent of the costs of scrapping&#13;
equipment because the need for such scrapping was created by a government&#13;
agreement to curb exports. By September 1972 the Government had paid&#13;
Y25,564 million (about US$83 million) in compensation. According to Hirono&#13;
(1978, p. 28), a trust fund was established under the 1977 "Law for Temporary&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 175 -&#13;
Measures for Stabilising the Specific Declining Industries" to compensate&#13;
firms in several industries for reduction of their excess capacity.&#13;
It is not clear whether these programs can be described as&#13;
"composite" at all. Quite separate legislation exists to deal with workers,&#13;
for example. Similarly, while Government encourages firms to move overseas&#13;
in order to produce increasingly uncompetitive raw-material and labor-&#13;
intensive products, these too are separate measures (Ibid, p. 26). The truth&#13;
is, no doubt, that in the Japanese context all measures should be seen as&#13;
combining in a coordinated and flexible manner (whatever the nominal distinc-&#13;
tions between the laws and programs), in order to achieve the desired readjust-&#13;
ment. Thus, the distinction we have introduced between the elements of&#13;
adjustment policy and composite programs is presumably irrelevant in the more&#13;
activist and less legalistic framework of Japan.&#13;
b. iii. European coal and steel&#13;
The policy of the European Coal and Steel Community, while changing&#13;
in detail and emphasis over the years, remains a true example of an inte-&#13;
grated approach to an industry. Apart from restricting imports of compe-&#13;
titive oil, and thus slowing the transfer from the use of coal, the program&#13;
has included subsidized loans for a number of investment purposes as well as&#13;
grants for the readaptation of workers. Up to the end of 1977 the ECSC had&#13;
made total subsidized loans of EUC 4,841 million, of which 62 percent had&#13;
gone to investment in the iron and steel industry, 18 percent had gone to&#13;
investment in coal mining, 9 percent had gone towards investment in new&#13;
industries located in areas where steel workers and coal miners were becoming.&#13;
redundant, 5 percent had gone towards the provision of subsidized housing for&#13;
workers in these industries, and the rest had been used for investment in&#13;
thermal power stations and iron ore mines, for resettlement, for technical&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 176 -&#13;
research and miscellaneous purposes (European Coal and Steel Community et al,&#13;
February 1978, Table 6). In 1977, total lending was EUC 742 million, of&#13;
which only 2 percent was for attracting new industry into areas of declining&#13;
labor force in mining and and steel (Ibid, Table 7). Aid for the readapta-&#13;
tion of workers in 1977 was EUC 26 million, covering 17,000 workers, or&#13;
EUC 1,500 per worker, which is about 50 percent more than the average amounts&#13;
received by trade displaced workers in the current United States adjustment&#13;
program (Ibid, Table 8).&#13;
Of the total expenditure of the ECSC only the sums for attracting&#13;
new industry into an area of declining employment and the expenditures on the&#13;
training, relocation and compensation of redundant workers are clearly&#13;
related to the end of adjustment, as we have defined it. Subsidized lending&#13;
to coal and steel reduced the decline of the former and presumably accelerated&#13;
the growth of the latter, but to the extent that in the former case it did&#13;
not prevent growing reliance on oil (which was perhaps excessive), prior to&#13;
1973, the measures were clearly not incompatible with adjustment to imports.&#13;
Furthermore, Little, Scitovsky and Scott (1970, pp. 284-285) point out that,&#13;
in addition, governments such as that of West Germany compensated private&#13;
owners for the closure of their pits. Thus, viewed as an adjustment&#13;
program, that for coal, in particular, has combined the customary direct&#13;
measures to improve productivity and competitiveness with measures to bring&#13;
in new sources of employment to affected areas (i.e. community assistance),&#13;
to increase labor mobility (through training and resettlement), to provide&#13;
compensation to workers for the loss of their jobs, and to provide compen-&#13;
sation to capitalists for the closure of their pits. The combined program&#13;
has had considerable success: the labor force in mining declined by 34 percent&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 177 -&#13;
or 290,000 men in Germany and France alone between 1962 and 1975 (OECD, 1972&#13;
and 1978) without any insuperable problems of labor absorption, although&#13;
the buoyancy of the economies was obviously decisive. In the currently&#13;
radically different circumstances of these industries, with the renewed&#13;
profitability of coal and the declining profitability of steel,'the problems&#13;
are somewhat different, and the abllity of the ECSC to manage a smooth&#13;
adjustment to alterations in the trading environment, especially in steel, is&#13;
under substantial challenge.&#13;
b. iv. The Canadian-American Automotive Agreement&#13;
The interest in the Canadian-American Automotive Agreement of&#13;
1965 lies in the fact that it represents an attempt to deal with the&#13;
problems created by adjustment to reciprocal liberalization within an&#13;
industry. The aim was to increase the efficiency of the North American&#13;
automobile industry through increased intra-industrial specialization. One&#13;
can envisage a similar aim being embodied in agreements between groups of&#13;
developing and developed countries to liberalize trade in textiles and clothing,&#13;
the presumption being that the developed countries will tend to specialize&#13;
in the former and the developing countries in the latter. The adjustment&#13;
assistance provisions of the Canadian-American Agreement were designed to&#13;
deal with the problems created for those affected by such reciprocal liberali-&#13;
zation, and were therefore an important means of increasing the political&#13;
acceptability of the trade agreement itself.&#13;
In the U.S., under the Automotive Products Trades Act of 1965 a group&#13;
of workers or a firm were eligible for assistance provided there was actual or&#13;
threatened "dislocation" and the operation of the agreement had been a-"primary fac-&#13;
tor" in causing the dislocation. According to Frank (1977, p.55), "Under the law,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 178 -&#13;
a decrease in domestic production, together with either an appreciable&#13;
decrease in exports to Canada greater than any increase in Canadian production&#13;
of the good, or an increase in imports from Canada, was regarded as prima&#13;
facie evidence that the operation of the agreement was a primary cause of the&#13;
dislocation." However, as Frank notes, this was not the only way that the&#13;
agreement could cause dislocation. For example, production might shift&#13;
within the United States or a parts manufacturer might lose sales as a&#13;
result of closure of a customer. In practice, because the administration&#13;
of the agreement was handled by an Automotive Agreement Adjustment Board,&#13;
with the Tariff Commission playing a purely fact-finding role, because the&#13;
eligibility conditions were more liberal than those in the 1962 Trade&#13;
Expansion Act, and because of the vaguenss of the language, the program was&#13;
considerably more effective than that under the 1962 Act. Indeed, it&#13;
influenced the form of the 1974 Act. It also had the particular merit of&#13;
allowing for the effects of a decline in exports. In all during the three&#13;
years'currency of the Act, fourteen successful petitions were made by&#13;
workers and 1,943 were found eligible for assistance payments. The average&#13;
worker received twenty weeks of readjustment allowances and small retraining&#13;
benefits, the average sum received being $2,100.&#13;
One of the key features of the   Canadian-American Automotive Agree-&#13;
ment was that a parallel adjustment program was created in Canada. Under the&#13;
Automotive Manufacturing Assistance Regulations of 1965, an Adjustment&#13;
Assistance Board was created in Canada (Mukherjee, 1978, pp. 66-7). The&#13;
Board was responsible for certifying eligibility of workers and firms, who&#13;
had suffered or were likely to suffer injury. As in the United States, the&#13;
main benefit for workers consisted of supplements to unemployment benefits.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 179 -&#13;
b. v.   Conclusion&#13;
The programs we have considered have in common only the focus on&#13;
specific industries, but they differ in their aim and in the means emploYyed.&#13;
Clearly there is always the danger that a program organized around an industry&#13;
will have as one of its objectives saving the industry itself in some form or&#13;
other. In this case, whether the program is successful or not, the result&#13;
is likely to be a failure to accept greatly increased imports, and indeed&#13;
growing protection. Thus, it is essential that any funds for modernization&#13;
or re-equipment be used only for those sorts of investments that are compatible&#13;
with growing imports. This, in turn, means that such funds can be justified&#13;
only if the government has made it clear that protection will not be granted&#13;
to save the industry (if subsidized capital to vulnerable industry can be&#13;
justified at all). The second lesson is that the industry-focus does indeed&#13;
simplify administration. This is obvious when, as in the case of the coal&#13;
and steel industries in Europe, one has a few large establishments, generally&#13;
of great importance to a particular area. However, the same also seems to&#13;
be true even of such unconcentrated industries as textiles. Thus in the case&#13;
of the United Kingdom Cotton Industry Act, the entire administration could be&#13;
delegated to the Cotton Board which possessed the necessary detailed information&#13;
on the amounts and kind of machinery installed in particular mills, on financial&#13;
relationships among the firms, and on the condition of the machinery (Miles,&#13;
1968, p.53). A third lesson is that compensativn to firms for scrapping equip-&#13;
ment is feasible. Finally, the Canadian-American Automotive Agreement indicates&#13;
the potential for integrating generous adjustment assistance into a specific&#13;
liberalization agreement as part of an attempt to secure its acceptance.&#13;

C.   Economy-Wide Adjustment Programs&#13;
The idea of an economy-wide, inter-related approach is attractive&#13;
to some authors, and it is worth specifying why we consider it vacuous.&#13;
Given any country that possesses all the elements of adjustment policy on a&#13;
nation-wide scale, and most do, what is an economy-wide restructuring program&#13;
beyond the sumof those independent component programs plus the effective&#13;
operation of the market? The answer seems to us to be nothing. A focus&#13;
towards trade or a particular industry is something distinct. It is possible&#13;
to imagine combining the various elements of adjustment policy with a parti-&#13;
cular focus of this kind, and such programs exist. However, the sum of each&#13;
individual element of adjustment policy, if operated on a national scale, is&#13;
simply an economy-wide adjustment program, and that is all that an economy-&#13;
wide adjustment program can be, unless we can imagine comprehensive planning&#13;
of the economy.&#13;
To take the example of the Netherlands, which seemed to have&#13;
particularly ambitious ideas in this direction the aim was "selective&#13;
growth", taking into account environmental conservation, the need for physical&#13;
planning, the saving of energy and scarce raw materials, and the aim of&#13;
increasing the access of developing countries. Since it is impossible for&#13;
a market economy as open as the Netherlands to plan comprehensively, the idea&#13;
seemed to be to penalize or promote certain activities, in relation to their&#13;
desirability in terms of the four criteria, by using taxes and subsidies. There&#13;
were also to be indicative plans for individual sectors of industry, regional&#13;
assistance, manpower policy, and support for desirable forms of technical&#13;
progress. Now, it is quite clear that the Government of the Netherlands&#13;
(if it ever carries out this approach) intends to be exceptionally activist&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 181 -&#13;
and interventionist; but it is unclear that the approach is any more than a&#13;
combination of industrial policy, regional policy, and manpower policy,&#13;
together with the particular objective of opening up trade with developing&#13;
countries. A "shopping list" does not create an integrated program, however&#13;
desirable the individual items on that list.&#13;
In essence, to have something deserving the name of an economy-wide&#13;
adjustment program, rather than a set of policies and a list of desiderata,&#13;
there must be, as there is for trade-related or industry-oriented, programs, one&#13;
clear organizing principle, towards which everything is directed. The closest&#13;
to such a situation is that of Japan. According to Hirono (1978), the&#13;
Japanese authorities do have a clear goal for the evolution of their economy,&#13;
together with a wide range of formal and informal policies designed to achieve&#13;
their end. Their idea is to focus, within the context of generally lower&#13;
growth, on the development of industries which are relatively intensive in&#13;
human capital, while abandoning the domestic production of labor-intensive and,&#13;
subsequently, physical capital-intensive goods. However, they do not wish&#13;
to lose the benefit of the accumulated knowledge and experience of managers&#13;
and entrepreneurs in the latter industries, and for that reason they have&#13;
encouraged them to set up in neighboring countries with suitable natural&#13;
resource or labor endowments, and export either to Japan or elsewhere. Mean-&#13;
while those who have to close down in Japan and are unable to relocate over-&#13;
seas are compensated. At the same time, there has been growing resort to&#13;
the normal range of labor market and regional policies. This broad strategic&#13;
conception does perhaps justify the name of an economy-wide adjustment program.&#13;
E. Conclusion&#13;
Let us attempt to pull the threads together.   It is importknt td&#13;
stress that what will work and is, indeed, appropriate obviously depends on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 182 -&#13;
the circumstances, traditions and ideologies of individual countries, and,&#13;
in the case of Europe, of groups of countries. We have suggested that the&#13;
following questions be kept in mind. Is the country generally market-oriented&#13;
or interventionist? Ts the interventionism forward-looking or defensive?&#13;
Does there exist a comprehensive and generous welfare state? Is trade a very&#13;
large part of the economy? Is there noticeably greater resistance to trade-&#13;
related changes than to any others? We have attempted to describe the&#13;
differences between the circumstances of the United States, Europe, and Japan,&#13;
which explain the first's reliance on a trade-related program, the second's&#13;
use of a range of general measures combined with some industry-specific inter-&#13;
ventions, and the last's emphasis crn a strategy of "forward planning" of&#13;
the industrial sector.&#13;
In our discussion of the various kinds of micro-economic policy that&#13;
may be thought to help adjustment, mention has not been made of the under-&#13;
lying ideologies that justify the use of one or other element or combination&#13;
of elements. Yet it is evident that certain combinations are particularly&#13;
likely to occur,and this important point is the focus of the succeeding&#13;
chapter. However, the present chapter provides useful background to that&#13;
discussion and permits the following observations: the first is that many&#13;
interventions by government are evidently defensive in orientation, and the&#13;
distinction between defensive and positive orientations cuts across those&#13;
between the various types of policy that have been discussed. A defensive&#13;
approach is particularly likely when direct assistance to industry is involved,&#13;
but is also far from unlikely in manpower and regional policies. A second&#13;
point is that the various kinds of interventions which are designed to make&#13;
markets work better can consist either of direct attempts to remove existing&#13;
distortions or of subsidies to offset their effects. It is particularly&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 183 -&#13;
when failures are thought to be spontaneous and not open to direct political&#13;
action that subsidies are most readily used. The danger here is that even&#13;
"spontaneous" distortions do not occur independently of government action to&#13;
offset their effects. Thus, inability to achieve either regional mobility&#13;
or wage flexibility of labor is arguably worsened by income security, regional&#13;
and manpower policies designed to offset the consequences of just those&#13;
rigidities. Finally, it appears from our discussion that, while an orientation&#13;
towards the survival of existing vulnerable industry is very unlikely to&#13;
prove other than counterproductive, carefully designed general industrial,&#13;
regional and manpower policies can be useful in improving the workings of the&#13;
economy, and income maintenance and compensation programs can help to distri-&#13;
bute the burden of change more widely. However, none of these general&#13;
policies has, at least in the context of low growth and high unemployment,&#13;
assuaged the force of protectionist pressure.&#13;
It is because of the essentially political nature of what was&#13;
identified in the previous chapter as the "adjustment problem", that we have&#13;
placed particular emphasis on policies designed to help all those affected&#13;
by a particular source of change. The advantage of policies designed to&#13;
help firms, workers and regions affected by particular imports or the decline&#13;
of a particular industry is essentially political. What is provided is a&#13;
very visible alternative .to an often-futile attempt to preserve the status&#13;
quo. Thus trade or the fate of a particular industry becomes an organizing&#13;
principle for assistance. Programs designed to provide especially high&#13;
compensation to workers displaced by trade and t assist firms to restructure&#13;
their operations in those circumstances exist in the United States, Canada,&#13;
and the Netherlands. Apart from specific problems that exist with all of them,&#13;
there is the general difficulty that delays and uncertainty are inevitable&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 184 -&#13;
when benefits are pointed only to those already affected by a particular&#13;
sour:e of change. The consequence tends to be either that adjustment itself&#13;
is delayed or that the benefits come too late to be relevant to decision-&#13;
makers at the time of a lay-off or of contraction of the firm. In general,&#13;
the costs faced by fixed factors are quite inadequately compensated in these&#13;
programs. Thus, the political benefit is much diluted. There is also the&#13;
problem that assistance to firms seems largely aimed at keeping the moribund&#13;
alive, thus adding to (rather than subtracting from) the general protec-&#13;
tionism of zombie firms. The problem of delay can be dealt with by using&#13;
an industry, rather than a specific source of change, as the organizing&#13;
principle. The simplicity that arises from "pre-certifying" the industry's&#13;
eligibility is real, although there is also the problem that the boundary of&#13;
an industry is inevitably arbitrary. However, the greatest actual disadvan-&#13;
tage of the industry-oriented approach is that, instead of using the&#13;
industry as a vehicle for identifying those eligible for compensation, man-&#13;
power or community assistance, there is a tendency to attempt to shore up the&#13;
industry itself. In this way, we return to the lest desirable element of&#13;
adjustment policy, namely, "restructuring" of industry with all its drawbacks.&#13;
Finally, the economy-wide approach has been discussed. We have&#13;
taken the view that, unless one is referring to the sum of individual&#13;
policies (or to the market itself), this does not exist. The closest case&#13;
seem3 to be that of Japan, but it appears to be exceptional. The possibility&#13;
of comprehensive planning of industrialized economies, which would make the&#13;
"economy-wide" approach a reality, seems remote and unrealistic.&#13;

V. TOWARDS IMPROVED ADJUSTMENT POLICIES&#13;
What is desired is greater willingness to accept rather than resist&#13;
the changes in economic structure that trade with developing countries can&#13;
bring about. As Corden (1974, p. 111) states,"The idea of adjustment assistance&#13;
is to encourage rather than to slow up change, and at the same time to.provide&#13;
some compensation for the industries or factors of production concerned."&#13;
Corden distinguishes two aspects of adjustment policy, namely, pure&#13;
compensation and policy to increase the efficiency of change and reduce the&#13;
costs of the unemployment of resources. However, the distinction cannot be too&#13;
sharply drawn. Thus, "Insofar as the alternative to adjustment assistance is&#13;
straightforward protection, rather than non-intervention, one can say that&#13;
adjustment assistance fosters the transfer of resources even when it consists&#13;
purely of income compensation not tied directly to the transfer of resources"&#13;
(Ibid, p. 112).- The other measures we have reviewed are all designed to increase&#13;
the efficiency of change, although they will also indirectly reduce the private&#13;
costs facing those directly affected. Thus, the distinction between the&#13;
industrial, regional, manpower, and information policies, on the bne hand, and&#13;
compensation, on the other, is far from complete.&#13;
The distinction has a major operational implication. There is really&#13;
little sense in orienting industrial, regional, or manpower policy to any&#13;
specific source of change. The aim of these policies is to improve the&#13;
workings of the market, or rather to offset market failures, whatever the imme-&#13;
diate cause of the change that reveals those failures. However, compensation&#13;
can be made specific to particular kinds, or sources, of private costs, and-&#13;
can therefore be particularly valuable politically.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 186 -&#13;
Another distinction needs to be recalled between three quite&#13;
different approaches,discussed in Chapter II , to what is needed to improve&#13;
the efficiency of the process of resouce reallocation itself. Neoclassical&#13;
economists tend to accept the value of the market as a means of making&#13;
decisions, and emphasize policies to make it work better. This usually means&#13;
the removal (or offsetting) of distortions in factor markets, in the provision&#13;
of information, indeed in the whole array of price signals facing entrepreneurs.&#13;
They may also emphasize the need to bring about improvements in the distri-&#13;
bution of income. More conservative economists might emphasize the responsi-&#13;
bility of government for most distortions and insist upon the need for much&#13;
less intervention. However, there exists quite a different approach that&#13;
emphasizes the inadequacies of the market as a system of coordination. The&#13;
implication is that the process of decision-making be transferred increasingly&#13;
to the political sphere, starting perhaps with the negotiation of sector&#13;
plans among the "social partners", proceeding by way of "planning agreements"&#13;
between government and firms and of direct state entrepreneurship, and&#13;
finishing up with complete central planning of the Eastern European-kind.&#13;
Let us also reiterate the significance of our particular goal. Much&#13;
of the discussion of adjustment in the literature is not particularly concerned&#13;
with the specific question of adjustment to imports from developing countries.&#13;
Given our concern, we emphasize policies to reduce what is seen as a bias&#13;
against change brought about in this way.&#13;
In the light of these distinctions and related differences among&#13;
countries (see Chapter IV), it is possible to create certain ideological "ideal&#13;
types" of alternative approaches to economic policy, in general, and trade, in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 187 -&#13;
particular, among those who desire adjustment. The key distinctions are&#13;
between market-oriented and directly interventionist countries. Account must&#13;
also be taken of alternative attitudes to trade and of the different kinds of&#13;
interventionism. In the process of explaining the different fundamental&#13;
approaches, their likelihood of success (from our point of view) can also be&#13;
evaluated, taking account of the detailed discussion in the previous chapter.&#13;
A. Adjustment Policies For Market Economies&#13;
a.   The General Policy Environment&#13;
Let us imagine a country with devotion to the ideal of the free&#13;
market. It desires to minimize the scale of government activity and of&#13;
bureaucratic intervention in the economy, and leaves responsibility for&#13;
shifting resources to private decision-makers. It also believes that govern-&#13;
ment intervention to "offset" distortions is a cure worse than the disease,&#13;
since it increases the arbitrary decision-making of government, the size of&#13;
the distortion to be "offset" will be unknown, and, most seriously, the&#13;
willingness of individual actors to take action on their own account will be&#13;
undermined by the knowledge that the government will provide, whatever the&#13;
nature or cause of the underlying distortion. Thus, it sees governmental&#13;
regional, manpower, or industrial policy as a treadmill, in which at each&#13;
stage it attempts to buy its way out of distortions created by actions at&#13;
earlier stages. Thus, most existing distortions are created by government&#13;
action and can be cured only by less intervention. (See Blackhurst, Marian&#13;
and Tumlir, 1978, especially pp. 68 and 77).&#13;
It is evident that no Western country of any importance comes close&#13;
to this position -- perhaps unfortunately. Nonetheless, there are countries,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 188 -&#13;
such as the United States and West Germany, where the extent of government&#13;
responsibility for what occurs is not considered to'be unlimited, and such&#13;
responsibility as it has assumed is under attack. The issue for us is&#13;
whether in such a context an adjustment policy can play a useful,role in&#13;
regard to trade, and,if so, what it should be.&#13;
b.   Protection and Compensation in a Market Economy&#13;
b.i. Protectionism&#13;
The essential point is that in such countries as West Germany and&#13;
the United States there exists undesirable protection, and it is apparently&#13;
biased against the developing countries. Thus, attempts are made to prop up&#13;
the position of those dependent for their livelihood on industries that are&#13;
vulnerable to imports. The "Conservative Social Welfare Function" exists.&#13;
The question is what to do about it. One way is to *improve the general system.&#13;
of income maintenance, thus reducing the desire to stay in a particular indus-&#13;
try, and, more important, the willingness of the rest of society to support&#13;
protection in order to preserve the incomes of those affected. However, the&#13;
effectiveness of any such policy is questionable given the resistance that&#13;
already exists in countries with extremely generous welfare systems. The only&#13;
general policy that might achieve the end is one of complete compensation, in&#13;
lump sum form, for everyone affected by change, and this is not feasible in any&#13;
circumstance, let alone in the sort of country we have described. Instead, let&#13;
us have resort in the political context to the principle that distortion-&#13;
removing policy should be directed exclusively at the distortion itself and&#13;
side effects should be minimized. In this case, the correct policy is pre-&#13;
sumably to compensate those who would otherwise be able to secure, or already&#13;
have secured, protection.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 189 -&#13;
There are several arguments against the principle of compensating-&#13;
those affected by economic change. Thus, it may be argued that there is no&#13;
reason to maintain people at the level of income which they expect. A more&#13;
valid criterion would seem to be the actual income level, irrespective of how&#13;
the individual arrived at it. Furthermore, it can be argued that risks are to&#13;
be borne by economic agents, which certainly includes all firms and presumably&#13;
includes all workers in a market economy. While it may be admitted that there&#13;
are certain circumstances in which society should subsidize risk, it would be&#13;
felt that these are very special cases. Whatever the validity of these argu-&#13;
ments, (and they seem to us not without force), they are irrevelant in a&#13;
context in which a particularly inefficient form of income maintenance is&#13;
already granted, namely, protection. The central point is that we wish to&#13;
change an established line of policy, and we may in that context have resort&#13;
to Giersch's argument that "nobody should suffer from policies which were&#13;
introduced after he or she acquired specific resources" (Giersch, 1978, p.24).&#13;
Combining this principle with the desire to remove existing protection and&#13;
prevent its future use, we may justify the use of compensation.&#13;
b.ii. The feasibility of compensation&#13;
If the aim is to compensate instead of protect, the amount should&#13;
presumably be no more than that required to make it possible not to have&#13;
resort to the latter. The sum would, therefore, be equal to or less than the&#13;
compensation which would make those directly affected by a change indifferent&#13;
between the receipt of protection or its absence. How close it would have to&#13;
be to the full level of compensation depends, in effect, on how willing the&#13;
rest of society would be to see those affected bear a part of the cost them-&#13;
selves. In practice, it is infeasible and probably unneceseary to provide full&#13;
compensation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 190 -&#13;
The infeasibility of paying full compensation to all those affected&#13;
is the result of two factors: firstly, the removal of protection creates a&#13;
substantial short-term transfer from producers to consumers (much of which&#13;
comes from those continuing in business or in employment in the industry,&#13;
depending on the degree of supply elasticity). Magee (1972) estimates that in&#13;
the U.S.A. for tariffs alone in 1971 the transfer to producers from consumers&#13;
of import substitutes (including directly competitive and indirectly compe-&#13;
titive imports), was $5 billion per annum, while the deadweight loss of the&#13;
tariffs was only $500 miilion. While comparable information is not available&#13;
for non-tariff barriers, Magee estimated the deadweight loss at $2.4 billion,&#13;
from which one can reasonably conclude that the transfer from consumers to&#13;
producers (largely on textiles and petroleum at that time) is at least as&#13;
large as that created by tariffs. On that assumption, and updating to 1976&#13;
prices, one obtains an annual transfer from consumers to producers created by&#13;
tariffs and quotas of $14 billion. Discounted over twenty years at 5 percent&#13;
the present value is $170 billion, and at 10 percent it is $120 billion.&#13;
There can be no prospect of providing so large a sum to those affected by the&#13;
instantaneous removal of protection. Secondly, it will be extremely difficult&#13;
(and indeed arbitrary) to allocate the sum between the various factors of&#13;
production, since the distribution of the costs will depend, in part, on the&#13;
long-run supply elasticities of each factor (which are unknown).&#13;
It also appears to be undesirable to arrange full compensation.&#13;
Most of the cost will be borne by sector-specific factors, such as existing&#13;
fixed physical and human capital. Over the long term, unskilled labor can move&#13;
elsewhere quite readily, given normal turnover in any industry. However, it&#13;
seems politically undesirable to give most of the compensation to those who are&#13;
already rather well off. Certainly it may be felt that compensation for failing&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 191 -&#13;
to anticipate the policy change or the change in world prices should not go&#13;
to large, diversified firms. One can expect such firms, their shareholders&#13;
and their managers to survive without transfers from government. Furthermore,&#13;
workers who obtain high incomes from substantial accumulations of human capital&#13;
(often subsidized by society) or because of union power, cannot expect to&#13;
be maintained by society at the level to which they are accustomed. It may&#13;
also be felt that society responds to the fate of those who lose their jobs&#13;
or are bankrupted and that, if someone chooses to stay, he must attempt to&#13;
do his best for himself. Finally, it may be noted that in the long term all&#13;
factor supplies should be highly elastic, and therefore, the transfer-does not&#13;
exist for ever. If we do wish to help factors that are sector-specific in the&#13;
short run, a policy of steadily falling subsidization or protection combined&#13;
with restrictions on further entry of such factors may be appropriate.&#13;
In sum, it may be best to restrict compensation to those who are&#13;
actually separated from an import-affected industry, excluding from such&#13;
compensation large firms (especially when diversified) and the full pay of&#13;
those who are better off. In addition, it may be thought desirable to provide&#13;
compensation to communities which are severely affected by plant closure or&#13;
lay-offs. Compensation may also be given for the loss in value of such&#13;
physical assets as housing (although such a policy may be seen as largely&#13;
intended to improve mobility). The best system, given the existence of a&#13;
social security system, is a lump sum paid at the time of separation or plant&#13;
closure to those eligible.&#13;
Before we turn to the details of organization, let us review certain&#13;
principles. The first point is that, if one wishes to provide compensation&#13;
only to those who lose their jobs or to bankrupt firms, it must be recognizefd&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 192 -&#13;
that there was some probability of these events occurring even within&#13;
protection. To take an example, let us suppose that under protection a&#13;
worker considers that he has a 10 percent risk of losing his job, and the&#13;
private cost of such a loss is $2,500. Then, the expected loss is $250, even&#13;
under protection. Assume that without protection the probability of losing&#13;
the job rises to 50 percent and the expected value of the loss is then $1,250.&#13;
If the government offers compensation of $2,000 per man as an alternative to&#13;
protection, the private cost of the loss of a job becomes $500 and its&#13;
expected value, at $250, is the same as that under protection. The implication&#13;
is that the compensation to be offered by government need not be equal to the&#13;
private cost of job loss, if it is specified at the time of trade liberali-&#13;
zation (or avoidance of protection), when those involved are not sure of&#13;
what their fate will be. The second point is that, by varying the compensation,&#13;
one can accelerate the rate of departure from the industry and use the policy in&#13;
.an "anticipatory" fashion, if that is desired. Thus, in the example we have&#13;
given, $2,500 may be the mean expected private cost. If the government offers&#13;
$2,000 in compensation, those for whom the private cost is less will leave.&#13;
This will bring about a decline in the labor force, and thus increase the&#13;
security of those remaining who are a fortiori those with a higher expected&#13;
cost from severence. In the third place, by identifying the characteristics&#13;
of %:.rkers which determine the Kpected private cost of the loss of a job&#13;
(such as age, skills, sex, the present wage and other factors), and allowing&#13;
for them in the formula to calculate the compensation payment (as is done&#13;
in the British Redundancy Payments Act), it is possible both to make most&#13;
workers indifferent between protection and liberalization cum compensation,&#13;
and to influence the characteristics of those who will leave.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 193 -&#13;
What of the principles that can be applied to firms and communities?&#13;
As far as the former are concerned, compensation will be given for the&#13;
necessity of exit, including voluntary plant closure. There seems to be no&#13;
way of compensating for partial scrapping of machinery which does not lead&#13;
to the finance of new investment, and it must be admitted that this danger&#13;
exists even with complete plant closure. In theory the cost to be compensated&#13;
is the difference between the present value of the profit stream expected&#13;
under protection and the value of the assets to be-sold.   Since the former&#13;
cannot be estimated, the closest approximation will be the book value of&#13;
assets-(allowing for depreciation and inflation since purchase).   The govern-&#13;
men't can offer some approximation to this sum to purchase firms or plants&#13;
in import-atfected industries,subject to an upper limit on the absolute&#13;
value of compensation (to exclude large firms), and to a lower limit,'to the&#13;
share of the firm's assets (to exclude diversified conglomerates).    The&#13;
government can then sell all the assets on the market. Alternatively, it can&#13;
allow the firm to sell the assets and pay a specified proportion of.the&#13;
difference between the book value of the assets and the price the firm obtained.&#13;
Three further points can be noted: firstly, as with workers, there is a&#13;
possibility of bankruptcy or plant closure even with protection. Thus, if&#13;
the amount to be paid in compensation is to be pre-announced at the time&#13;
liberalization (or the refusal to protect) occurs, it should not equal the&#13;
full book value of assets. Against this should be noted a second point,&#13;
namely, that many firms have valuable intangible assets, such as goodwill,&#13;
brand recognition, or the skills and knowledge of the proprietor. Finally,&#13;
it will be clear that the government can accelerate adjustment to imports by&#13;
scrapping product-specific assets (such as looms, sewing machines, or spindles),&#13;
even though they are still of positive value. This measure would have an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 194 -&#13;
"anticipatory" value similar to that of providing compensation to workers&#13;
at levels that encourage many to leave.&#13;
As for compensation for communities, while there is a purely&#13;
theoretical possibility of defining the reduction in income r4tgrously, it&#13;
would be impossible in practice. A rough and ready sum would have to be&#13;
computed, and this may be an adequate reason for not attempting pure compen-&#13;
sation to affected communities.&#13;
b. iii. The organization of compensation&#13;
There exist three situations in which the issue of assistance of&#13;
the kind we have been discussing will arise. The first is a decision 'to&#13;
liberalize existing protection; the second is a response to an industry's&#13;
request for emergency protection because of injury by imports; and the third&#13;
is when a firm that is not in the first two categories is about to go out&#13;
of business or close a plant, in part because of import competition. It is&#13;
the first two that are crucial for our anti-protectionist purpose, although&#13;
the last can lead to the second. Given the distinction between the three,&#13;
let us also accept as valid, Tumlir'a suggestion that "Efficient adjustment&#13;
policies would 000 have two general characteristics. They would be perman-&#13;
ently in plece (available immediately or within the shortest delay possible)&#13;
and would provide general incentives for adjustment action based on the&#13;
information currently available to the affected units " (Tumlir, 1976,&#13;
P. 19).o&#13;
Given the aim of liberalizing existing protection, it is possible&#13;
to start from a defined list of products, namely, those for which liberali-&#13;
zation till take place. In the context of a liberalization of the Generalized&#13;
System of Preferences, the list of "sensitive products" could be the right&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 195 -&#13;
place to start, although this may be very complex (Fels and Glisman, 1975,&#13;
p. 81). If existing non-tariff barriers were to be the focus, the products&#13;
would be defined accordingly, and the same applies to tariffs. As is usual in&#13;
these cases, liberalization can take place over a period of years, thus helping&#13;
the fate of the fixed factors, and no more needs to be said on that, except&#13;
to note that this is easier for non-tariff barriers if they are first turned&#13;
into tariffs. The key point would be that, at the time of announcing the&#13;
liberalization, the government can specify the compensation to be paid. Any&#13;
workers who leave (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, since the aim is not&#13;
to encourage behavior leading to sacking) firms that produce the specified&#13;
products will be entitled to a sum, unconditionally, depending on pay, age,&#13;
and years of service at the time of the announcement of liberalization.&#13;
This sum can be paid at any time until retirement,* but only on separation,&#13;
and will be adjusted for inflation. -     The sum will be calculated for each&#13;
group so that it is lower than the private cost of job loss, in order to&#13;
avoid a mass exodus of workers, but high enough to make the workers accept&#13;
the loss of the job. In order to facilitate administration, workers can be&#13;
certified prior to leaving the job, the criterion being the proportion of the&#13;
output of their plant that is concentrated in the liberalized products. It&#13;
can also be assumed that the lump sum will rise less than proportionately with&#13;
income, up to an upper bound, will rise with age (because of the growing&#13;
difficulty of getting a new job) and will then decline as the worker gets&#13;
1/   In the unlikely case that the net of tax real return on private&#13;
savings is positive, it will be necessary to provide some interest,&#13;
to avoid everybody leaving. Alternatively, if an inflation-indexed&#13;
asset provides an exceptionally good return, everybody will tend to&#13;
stay in his job. For this reason, it will be necessary in such a&#13;
case to avoid perfect indexation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 196 -&#13;
closer to retirement, and will be zero for an extremely short period of&#13;
work in the industry (rather than the firm) and will not rise continually&#13;
with that period.&#13;
As for firms, the government can state that it will pay a propor-&#13;
tion of the book value of assets (allowing for inflation) existing at the&#13;
time of the announcement to any firm producing the specified products,&#13;
subject to a lower limit to the share of those products in output. There&#13;
will be a maximum sum, and a minimum share of company assets. Compensation&#13;
will be paid only on plant closure or firm liquidation within the period of&#13;
liberalization until the change has worked its way through. No compensation&#13;
will be provided for assets obtained by firms after the announcement of the&#13;
liberalization. Again, as with workers, the firm can register its assets&#13;
and get agreement to the claim, prior to closure or liquidation, but there&#13;
is to be a time limit on these latter events.&#13;
There may be a simple revolving door of exits and entrances. For&#13;
example, a firm that intends to stay in business can arrange to sell its&#13;
assets to itself through proxies. For that reason, it may be better if the&#13;
government itself handles the sale. Similarly, workers can arrange to leave&#13;
their employer and return immediately after receiving the lump sum. In this&#13;
way, the program will come very close to providing compensation to all in&#13;
the industry and not just for permanent separations. It will be impossible&#13;
to avoid this behavior entirely, although it may be feasible to state that,&#13;
if a worker returns to his original employer within the period of unemployment&#13;
from which the private costs were calculated, he will lose a proportion of&#13;
the compensation amount.   (As we have noted, such   "revolving door"&#13;
practices have occurred with the United States adjustment assistance programs&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 197 -&#13;
in respect of automobile and steel workers.)&#13;
The way to handle requests for "emergency" protection will be&#13;
similar. Assuming that there are no security reasons for maintaining the&#13;
industry, in which case an explicit subsidy should be required, "emergency"&#13;
protection will not always be provided. Instead, if a finding of injury is&#13;
made, a compensation program similar to those for liberalization will be&#13;
announced, together with a time period for claims by firms. Again, all&#13;
compensation will be paid in relation to the sLtuation at the time of the&#13;
announcement of the finding of injury. "Emergency" protection of a rigorously&#13;
time-bound kind may be provided if the losses of sector-specific factors are&#13;
otherwise expected to be very severe and this is politically necessary.&#13;
The third situation is that of a firm or a group of workers&#13;
affected by imports, but not producing goods for which there is a liberali-&#13;
zation program or a program of "emergency" compensation. It is just these&#13;
situations with which a trade-related program like that of the United States&#13;
is equipped to deal. The basic approach of that program seems suitable for&#13;
our purpose, except that longer notice of lay-offs could usefully be required&#13;
as a condition for assistance, as in the current Canadian program, and firms&#13;
supplying at least 50 percent of their output to import-affected firms&#13;
(whether in the liberalization, "emergency", or general programs) could also&#13;
be made eligible. It would be necessary for the firm to be shown to be&#13;
affected by imports "importantly", whereupon workers leaving the firm would&#13;
be entitled to their lump sums, calculated as of the date of certification, and&#13;
the firm could get compensation if it closed. The difference from the current&#13;
United States program would be that workers would get more than they now do&#13;
and in one lump sum,.and firms would receive money only if they decided to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 198 -&#13;
close. However, since there is no general reason to encourage "anticipatory"&#13;
movement of factors from such firms, and since in the absence of a liberalization&#13;
or "emergency" program for an industry it can be assumed that imports are a&#13;
minor cause of the problem (since it is not industry-wide), compensation in&#13;
these cases might be set at lower levels than in the industry-wide cases.&#13;
What we have suggested is, therefore, a sort of marriage of&#13;
industry-and firm-specific programs. -/ A similar idea is put forward by&#13;
Frank (1977, p. 69) with his "Two-Tier System". However, our proposal differs&#13;
in that compensation is all that is provided, and the "first tier" consists&#13;
of the pre-identification of a list of products. Each applicant firm or&#13;
workers would still have to show that their firm was dependent on those&#13;
products. However, since this can be done prior to the need for any action&#13;
by government the procedure should not create delays. The entire program will&#13;
be further facilitated by having just one compensation scale for all trade-&#13;
affected workers and firms, depending simply on age, pay and length of service&#13;
for workers , and on maximum compensation and minimum share of firm assets for&#13;
the firms.&#13;
b. iv. The country situations&#13;
How do these ideas fit in with the situations of existing market-&#13;
oriented countries? In the case of the United States, it has already .been&#13;
accepted that adjustment assistance can be given in lieu of, or along with,&#13;
some emergency protection, as has happened with shoes. The entire adjustment&#13;
2/   The point can be put in another way by stating that a trade-related&#13;
program can be used both to provide industry-wide (or rather&#13;
product-group wide) coverage, and to help individual firms affected&#13;
by imports. Industry-specific programs can really only do the former.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 199 -&#13;
assistance program was introduced along with a policy of trade liberalization,&#13;
namely, the 1962 Trade Expansion Act. However, the latter covered so wide&#13;
a range of goods, because of the nature of subsequent Kennedy Round tariff&#13;
cuts, that it could not be used as a means of identifying specific vulnerable&#13;
products. The idea of pre-identifying vulnerable products would make sense,&#13;
however, if the items were those now under non-tariff barriers, or sensitive&#13;
items in the United States GSP. Thus, the shell of the current program&#13;
could be maintained (with a change in the nature of the benefits as we have&#13;
suggested), while permitting the Executive Branch to announce that an industry&#13;
judged to be injured by imports at an ITC hearing, or an industry affected by&#13;
a specific liberalization of existing measures of special protection (largely&#13;
non-tariff barriers but also very high tariffs), would be "pre-certified".&#13;
Such special decisions could be taken exclusively in favor of developing&#13;
countries (starting with textiles and clothing), thus reducing the program's&#13;
total cost and increasing its immediate relevance to our purposes.&#13;
In a country such as West Germany, where a general trade-related&#13;
program is not feasible, two possibilities exist, or a combination thereof.&#13;
One is to introduce a program similar to that suggested for the United States&#13;
but restricted entirely to the exports of developing countries. Again it&#13;
could be applied when liberalization of restrictions imposed on developing&#13;
countries is being considered, or when an industry requests discriminatory&#13;
protection against developing countries, or when a firm claims that is being&#13;
injured by imports from the developing countries and is required to lay off.&#13;
workers or to close its plant. In the former two cases, pre-certification of&#13;
the vulnerable products would occur and the firms would subsequently have to&#13;
prove their dependence upon them. The second approach is not to have any&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 200 -&#13;
general program, but merely to announce compensation terms ad hoc for specific&#13;
industries, for which liberalization is being considered or which successfully&#13;
claim injury. Of the two approaches, a general, clearly-defined trade program&#13;
oriented to the developing countries seems preferable but industry programs&#13;
are more in accord with practice.&#13;
b. v. The cost of the program&#13;
Obviously, for any government, cost is the main issue. These are&#13;
largely financial costs, of course, being transfers, with the real cost&#13;
depending on the incentive effects and administrative costs of raising revenue.&#13;
However, we do not have the information to calculate the financial costs of&#13;
the sort of program we have discussed. A few specific points need to be made:&#13;
firstly, the workers to be compensated will be all those leaving the affected&#13;
firms. No distinction can be made among the different sources of change. The&#13;
only exception will be natural wastage due to normal retirement. Secondly,&#13;
costs will be reduced to the extent that the criteria of import-vulnerability&#13;
are tightened (which is obvious), and to the extent that the focus is on&#13;
imports from developing countries. It is clear from Jacobson (1978, Tables 6&#13;
and 7) that, even for prime age males, earnings losses in the typical industry&#13;
affected by developing countries' exports are much below those in the industries&#13;
largely affected by the competition of the developed. Furthermore, according&#13;
to Frank (1977, Tables 3-6 and 3-9), developing countries account for only&#13;
half of the import displacement in the United States. (This ratio is much&#13;
lower for European countries because of the role of intra-European trade.)&#13;
Finally, it is possible for the government to require firms to pay a proportion&#13;
of the cost of lay-offs, since the latter impose real social costs. However,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 201 -&#13;
while this seems to be a valid general principle, it is probably undesirable&#13;
to apply it to firms that are vulnerable to imports.&#13;
Since we wish to focus on what would happen in the context of a&#13;
program like that of the United States, but with substantial liberalization,&#13;
we follow figures calculated by Frank (1977, Table A-2). His most liberal&#13;
option gives a figure for those eligible of 100,000 per annum, which happens&#13;
to be very close to the actual number certified under the 1974 Act this far.&#13;
It seems to us reasonable to assume, firstly, that the number eligible&#13;
would increase with the rate of compensation, since obviously many do not&#13;
now apply (given the high involvement of unibn labor), and second that libera-&#13;
lization of non-tariff barriers would create a greater effect than tariff&#13;
liberalization alone. We assume, therefore, that the number eligible might&#13;
be 200,000 per annum. (Remember that this is not the same as the number&#13;
displaced by imports, but is the number eligible in vulnerable industries,&#13;
defined as the number losing employment for any reason in industries&#13;
experiencing declining output and employment, and increased import penetration).&#13;
At an earlier stage we used Bale's numbers to calculate a private cost per&#13;
worker in 1976 prices of $2,750. To this should be added the average cost&#13;
of trade readjustment allowances of $1,300; thus the average&#13;
cost to workers would be about $4,000. (These figures would&#13;
probably be much higher for well-paid workers in such industries&#13;
as automobiles and steel (Jacobson, 1978, p. 98), but we have already&#13;
decided not to compensate such workers fully.) In order to provide a dis-&#13;
incentive to leaving, we set compensation at 75 percent of the private costs,&#13;
or $3,000 for each worker which makes the total cost $600,000,000 per annum&#13;
in 1976 prices. This can be compared with an actual cost of the 1974 US program&#13;
go far of about $150,000,000 per annum. However, if the focus were to be on&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 202 -&#13;
those affected by the developing countries, the cost could be halved. From&#13;
the point of view of development, $300,000,000 per annum would be a small&#13;
price to pay for a removal of most protectionist barriers.&#13;
While we have been able to make this extremely rough and ready&#13;
calculation of the cost of compensating workers leaving vulnerable industries,&#13;
we are not in a position to calculate the cost of compensation of firms or of&#13;
communities.&#13;
B. Adjustment Policies for Market-Oriented Interventionist Countries&#13;
Most individual countries are interventionist in varying degrees,&#13;
and most are also protectionist to some extent. The efficient way to deal with&#13;
the latter problem is to introduce a compensation program on the lines we have&#13;
suggested. With various modifications depending on the importance of trade&#13;
and the willingness to focus exclusively on developing countries, the approach&#13;
seems appropriate for almost all countries. However, it may be useful, in&#13;
addition, to employ positive policies designed to bring social and private&#13;
costs closer together if it is believed that existing distortions can indeed&#13;
be removed by government action, either through subsidization or other means.&#13;
Such policies are essentially economy-wide, and, to the extent that they are&#13;
successful, all adjustment will become more efficient. We begin by examining&#13;
the relationship between these policies and the specific problem of trade&#13;
with developing countries. We then examine whether the policies can be use-&#13;
fully incorporated into a trade-oriented program. It should be noted that&#13;
when what is recommended is the removal of existing policies that create the&#13;
distortion, the ideologue of the pure free market will, of course, concur.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 203 -&#13;
a.   Economy-Wide Corrective Policies&#13;
a.i. Regional policy&#13;
In order to make these policies effective from our specific point&#13;
of view, a number of ideas might be considered. It is essential that regional&#13;
policy not be a means of collecting together all the most vulnerable&#13;
industries. For that reason, it might be suggested that regional subsidies&#13;
and incentives not be given to firms producing sensitive products, as defined&#13;
by the various GSP schemes, or to firms producing products subject to&#13;
"emergency"=protection directed against the developing countries.     Fels&#13;
(1974, p. 256) has already made this useful suggestion.    Moreover, the aim&#13;
of regional policy is to create centers of viable and dynamic development.&#13;
For that reason it is appropriate to try to focus on creating growth poles in&#13;
areas which seem to have good potential, in part by financing excellent&#13;
infrastructure. Giersch (1978, p. 23) makes the suggestion that, in the&#13;
European context, such areas may be discovered in former border regions. In&#13;
addition, account must be taken of the nature of factor scarcities. The aim&#13;
of regional policy is to create viable employment for relatively-unskilled&#13;
workers where they live, rather than encourage migration. If the basis of the&#13;
comparative advantage of developed countries is highly-skilled labor., viable&#13;
employment for unskilled labor can only be created by encouraging the&#13;
latter's combination with the former. Thus, it is futile to subsidize&#13;
physical capital alone. On the contrary, it would make better sense to&#13;
subsidize unskilled and skilled labor, in addition to encouraging the creation&#13;
of the latter in the poorer regions through greatly improved education. it&#13;
may be appropriate to impose lower income taxes on the highly paid if they&#13;
live and work in designated areas, or in other ways encourage the skilled td&#13;
migrate where the unemployed, unskilled now are. (See Fels 1974, p.258).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 204&#13;
Finally, for cases where the closure of major industries brings about a&#13;
substantial decline in a community's employment and income, the government&#13;
could have a special "economic emergency" unit, both to channel resources to&#13;
the area and to coordinate the many activities and programs that government&#13;
offers. In this way, the communities affected can feel that direct action&#13;
is being taken to deal with their problems.&#13;
a. ii. Manpower policy&#13;
For an interventionist country, an active manpower policy is a&#13;
potentially valuable aid to adjustment. What policies may accord with our&#13;
aims? In the first place, the unemployment that is so large a part of the&#13;
resistance to imports may reflect in part excessively high prices for&#13;
unskilled labor brought about by payroll taxation, minimum wages, employment&#13;
protection legislation, unionization, redundancy payments, and so forth.&#13;
If these distortions cannot be tackled directly, it may be desirable to pro-&#13;
vide a general wage subsidy to all firms (and not just those which threaten&#13;
lay offs" which is the normal pattern now}   in a form that is concentrated&#13;
on the unskilled, perhaps by providing a fixed tax credit for each worker.&#13;
In the second place, the&#142; high levGl of payments conditional on not obtaining&#13;
a job, which are provided by most social security systems, seem to be a&#13;
probable cause of rising secular trends in unemployment. It would be&#13;
desirable to lower the marginal rates of tax on earning# implicit in such&#13;
arrangements, perhaps by providing omaller conditional benefits and higher&#13;
lump sum redundancy paymentso In the third place, training seems to be an&#13;
exceptionally valuable Investment, especially given the role of skills in&#13;
developed country comparative advantage and the number of women affected by&#13;
developing country impd l, most of whom are regionally immobile. Because of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 205 -&#13;
the value of on-the-job training, a subsidy might be provided for such&#13;
training to all firms, again in the form of a tax credit (since such costs&#13;
are already deductible from income).   The government might wish to improve&#13;
the capital market for those who find it difficult to finance their own&#13;
further training, by organizing loan schemes. In certain cases, government-&#13;
financed and operated training of a job-focused kind may be useful (see&#13;
Tumlir, 1976, p.20).    Finally, the social cost of unemployment is very high,&#13;
given the burden carried by the state. For that reason it is appropriate&#13;
for employers to pay directly for the maintenance of those they lay off, perhaps&#13;
by insisting as in the British case that they pay part of the redundancy&#13;
allowance.&#13;
Worker mobility can usefully be increased. Direct mobility grants&#13;
seem to be little used, even in a country like Sweden, perhaps because the&#13;
majority of workers can readily finance their moves. A greater problem is&#13;
the ties to the existing area or firms. One useful idea is that, when an&#13;
area is declared to be in an "economic emergency", part of the compensation&#13;
will go towards guaranteeing the value of owner-occupied housing for those&#13;
who wish to move, as is already done by the Defense Department of the United&#13;
States for its employees (Frank, 1977, p.77). Full vesting of pension&#13;
rights and their transferability is likely to prove a valuable aid to mobility,&#13;
especially when private pensions are an important part of income security&#13;
in old age. More radically, the specially tax-favored status of that part&#13;
of remuneration which is invested in a pension fund could be ended, not by&#13;
making it taxable but rather by exempting all savings from income tax, as&#13;
would happen under an expenditure tax. In such a case, the pension fund&#13;
might be increasingly replaced by the employee's own arrangements. In&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 206 -&#13;
countries which have succeeded in destroying the market for rented housing,&#13;
attachment of subsidies to people and not houses would be appropriate.&#13;
a. iii. Industrial policy&#13;
We have recorded considerable scepticism about the positive value&#13;
of most industrial policy in relation to the goal of adjusting to imports&#13;
from developing countries. Indeed, most of it seems to take the form of a&#13;
wasteful last-ditch defense, perhaps because few governments realize that&#13;
the competition is not with developing countries but with the more dynamic&#13;
industries of their own countries. Unfortunately, the competition of United&#13;
States clothing firms with, for example, United States exporters of machinery,&#13;
is likely to prove successful only if the dynamism of the latter is entirely&#13;
destroyed! Nonetheless, there exist some useful activities for countries&#13;
that rely on the market. For example, research and development is probably&#13;
under-funded by most firms. Government could provide incentives for firms&#13;
to carry out research and development, although, of course, measuring and&#13;
defining this activity is difficult. The value of the goiernment's own&#13;
industry-specific research and development is questionable, but, for the&#13;
developed countries as a whole (although not necessarily for the individual&#13;
countries) finance of basic scientific research has proved of great economic&#13;
benefit in the long run. For small-firms, technical assistance is possibly&#13;
worthwhile, and it is, at least, unlikely to do harm. Certainly, the model&#13;
of agricultural extension indicates that some contribution might be made.&#13;
Other policies to improve management, such as the promotion of mergers, may&#13;
be useful in certain circumstances, but it is far from the panacea that some&#13;
governments seem to have believed at certain times. Encouragement of invest-&#13;
ment is presumably essential for any adjustment process, largely because&#13;
capital's mobility depends on new ;ross investment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 207 -&#13;
Some governments are very much more interventionist than this in&#13;
industrial policy. A few countries have been successful in identifying and&#13;
nurturing the winning industries and firms of the future. While very far&#13;
from generalizable, success in such an endeavor can only be helpful to&#13;
adjustment. Failure, on the other hand, can lead to a disastrous growth of&#13;
permanent government subsidization of the unviable.&#13;
a.iv. Conclusion&#13;
If the sorts of policies discussed are successfully implemented,&#13;
adjustment will be smoother and, correspondingly, easy to bear. Perhaps of&#13;
greatest importance, success at the microeconomic level may make it possible to&#13;
pursue a macroeconomic policy leading to full employment and steady growth.&#13;
The latter does seem a precondition for willingness to accept increased&#13;
import penetration from the developing countries. However, this is a problem&#13;
of "the chicken and the egg", since without full employment an orientation&#13;
to the future rather than holding on to the past, to adjustment rather than&#13;
to defense, is unlikely to occur.&#13;
b.   Trade-Related Adjustment Policy-&#13;
The only trade-related program discussed this far is one of'&#13;
compensation. While it is our view that compensation must be at the heart&#13;
of any program especially geared to trade, to trade with developing countries,&#13;
or to industries judged 'largely uncompetitive because of imports, it need not&#13;
be the sole component. The question is "What might be added?" The components&#13;
must be those considered immediately above, but now in the context of trade-&#13;
related programs.&#13;
b.i. Industry assistance&#13;
The obvious approach is to provide subsidized funds to fimE&#13;
affected by imports. This far we have discussed only compensation for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 208 -&#13;
liquidation and plant closure. Alternatively, once the principle of "no&#13;
unlimited protection" is accepted, funds might be given to firms as well as&#13;
technical assistance, if they wish to adjust. The following principles&#13;
might be adopted: firstly, funds should not be subsidized although they may&#13;
be available for longer maturities and in larger amounts than the firm would be&#13;
able to get from the normal financial markets. Secondly, in order to avoid pure&#13;
process innovation, there might be a restriction on the decline in employment&#13;
in the firm, since it is assumed that the reason for trying to help the firm&#13;
is employment maintenance (and not, as often happens, the reverse). (See&#13;
Giersch, 1978, p.24 who also suggests that the provision of such funds be&#13;
linked to locational innovation). Thirdly, the funds will be provided only&#13;
to small firms, there being a ceiling both to the size of the loan and to the&#13;
size of the firm.&#13;
b. ii. Community assistance&#13;
A trade-related program can include a special program of community&#13;
assistance. Thus, if a given change is highly concentrated, a special unit&#13;
of the trade adjustment program's administration will have been created to&#13;
help coordination of assistance to the area, and to provide financial support.&#13;
Such a comprehensive program of community assistance can arise out of the&#13;
same circumstances as those in which a community is entitled to a straight-&#13;
forward compensation payment for a substantial trade-related economic change.&#13;
In practice, it appears from the current experience in the United States&#13;
that a special trade-related community assistance program makes little sense,&#13;
if there already exist more general programs and when trade is only a modest&#13;
source of change. In Europe, the resources and programs of the ECSC provide&#13;
a precedent which could be generalized to other major concentrated employers&#13;
such as shipbuilders.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 209 -&#13;
b. iii. Manpower programs&#13;
Workers who are entitled to compensation under a trade-related&#13;
program of the kind we have discussed above might-also be given special&#13;
eligibility for manpower programs, such as training, mobility allowances or&#13;
placement services. One of the advantages of "precertifying" an industry and&#13;
its workers is that the latter could receive their benefits while still&#13;
employed in their firm, especially for training. Thus, if "knitwear" were&#13;
declared to be injured, all workers in knitwear plants could apply to be made&#13;
eligible for their compensation payment, and might be given an entitlement&#13;
to one year's training at government's expense. The latter can be talten&#13;
while-still with the original firm, or after leaving and getting the&#13;
compensation payment. To simplify administration it may be necessary to&#13;
limit the time period for taking advantage of these benefits. Still,jmore&#13;
interesting, workers might be entitled to a period of government-financed&#13;
training with their new employers on-the-job. In the case of firms not under&#13;
such product group- or industry-wide programs, it will be necessary to&#13;
ensure adequate notice of lay-offs, in order to give the schemes time:to&#13;
"capture" the workers before they have already left and found a dew job,&#13;
as is now normally happening in the United States trade adjustment program.&#13;
b. iv. Locational innovation&#13;
It is possible for government to help firms to survive by making&#13;
it easier for them to move overseas or establish commercial relations with&#13;
firms that will do the subcontracting. Such assistance will be of particular&#13;
benefit to small firms.   One approach is to fit this into the-package of&#13;
benefits available to firms which have been declared eligible under a trade-&#13;
related or industry-oriented program. Thus, the technical assistan,e to be&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 210 -&#13;
offered to the firm might include information on possible places for&#13;
relocation or on places to look for overseas subcontractors. Financial&#13;
assistance available to the firm might also be provided if the firm decides&#13;
to move overseas (in which case compensation only goes to the-workers). The&#13;
government could insure the firm's assets against political risks in the&#13;
new country, or could attempt to arrange treaties covering such matters as&#13;
freedom and security of investment.&#13;
b.v. Organization&#13;
Provision of this wider and more interventionist package of benefits&#13;
to firms, workers and communities affected by trade-related changes would be&#13;
organized in exactly the same way as the compensation program considered -above&#13;
(for which it is not a replacement but a supplement). Thus, no particular&#13;
organizational issues arise, beyond those inherent 'n each element.&#13;
b.vi. Conclusion&#13;
We have indicated that, starting from the basis of a program&#13;
designed to compensate some of the victims of trade-induced change, an&#13;
assortment of more activist elements canr be added. However, except for&#13;
direct assistance to firms, in which we include support for locational inno-&#13;
vation, there seems to be no reason to add the other benefits, like baubles&#13;
on a Christmas tree. Manpower and caomunity assistance policies are&#13;
inherently general. However, it may be that, If the programs do already&#13;
exist at a general level but resources are scarce, the trade-related or&#13;
industry-specific program can be uee4 to allow those eligible to "jump the&#13;
queue9", as is indeed supposed to happen for various manpower benefits, like&#13;
training, under the current United States program of trade adjustment&#13;
assistance. Of course, too many cannot be made eligible under different&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 211 -&#13;
programs for such special assistance. If all are special, nobody is.&#13;
c.   "Anticipatory" Adjustment Assistance&#13;
Many authors have discussed the benefits and disadvantages of&#13;
"anticipatory" adjustment assistance or "pre-emptive" adjustment assistance.&#13;
Thus Henry et al.(1978, pp. 90-95) favor an "anticipatory" adjustment policy&#13;
which includes monitoring trends in comparative advantage, an employment&#13;
policy geared to the satisfaction of "social needs" and a regional policy&#13;
similar to that discussed above. Apart from the first of these, we fail to&#13;
see what is "anticipatory" about such a program. Giersch (1978, pp. 20-24)&#13;
also favors an "anticipatory" policy, which for him includes retraining,&#13;
migration or inducement to self-employment for workers; subsidies to firms&#13;
for retraining and locational innovation (both inter- and intra-national);&#13;
and assistance to regions to modify and transform existing infrastructure.&#13;
UNCTAD (1978, paras. 38-39) favors an "anticipatory" program that identifies&#13;
industries or sectors incapable of competing and deliberately encourages&#13;
factors of production to move out "in anticipation of the imminent need to&#13;
deal with major problems of import competition." It is just this last&#13;
version that Braun (1973, p. 208) rejects, since it is in his view impossible&#13;
to identify candidates to be phased out.&#13;
It is clear that, as with so much in this general area, the term&#13;
"anticipatory" adjustment assistance is used to conceal the most profound&#13;
differences of opinion.   If what is meant is the existence in advance of&#13;
specific need of certain general policies- to assist adjustment, such as&#13;
assistance to regions, industries, or labor, then what we have already&#13;
described is "anticipatory" assistance. Thus, we do not seem to disagree in&#13;
substance with Henry et al or Giersch. Moreover,.-if the creation of a trade-&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 212 -&#13;
related adjustment program or of a means of identifying vulnerable industries&#13;
plus the determination in advance of what benefits will apply in any parti-&#13;
cular case is "anticipatory" assistance, then what we have described is&#13;
"anticipatory" assistance in this sense also. However, if what is meant is&#13;
the decision to identify vulnerable industries before anything significant has&#13;
actually happened, as UNCTAD wishes, and to provide the benefits we have been&#13;
discussing to all those who wish to leave, it is not at all clear that&#13;
this is in the least necessary. If well-established and clear&#13;
measures exist to benefit those injured by trade-induced change&#13;
or by a policy of liberalization, there is no reason to identify specific&#13;
candidates prior to the need.&#13;
A part of our difference with UNCTAD results from a disagreement&#13;
over what should be included in the package, since UNCTAD believes basically&#13;
in replacing the market while we are discussing policy to make it operate&#13;
more efficiently (and, indeed, through compensation allowing it to operate&#13;
at all). It is evident that, if one wishes to replace the market, it is&#13;
necessary to start early in the context of a market economy. There is another&#13;
point that takes us some way in their direction. If a general trade-related&#13;
adjustment assistance program exists, there is no reason to anticipate change&#13;
because individual firms will come for their benefits when they belleve they&#13;
have been injured. This process, combined with monitoring of trends, will&#13;
make it perfectly easy to see when there is significant injury being created&#13;
to a range of firms producing particular products, and thus to justify the&#13;
announcement that all those producing those products are "precertified" as&#13;
eligible for trade assistance benefits. However, if a country has no such&#13;
prpgram but instead focuses only on whole industries or groups of firms&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 213 -&#13;
prod6cing similar products, and does not anticipate trends, many firms will&#13;
have been injured and received no benefits before the program of industry-&#13;
specific assistance has been created.   In order to avoid this basic inequity,&#13;
it will be necessary either to create a general program of trade adjustment&#13;
assistance to help injured firms or to have a system to identify and create&#13;
programs for industries very early in the process. In this sense, therefore,&#13;
we agree with the UNCTAD position.&#13;
It should be stressed that if there is a general consensus on liberal-&#13;
ization, then there is no objection to-the monitoring of trends&gt;and creation,&#13;
well in advance of serious injury, of industry-specific programs of the kind&#13;
we have discussed. Nor, at the same time, does it seem to be particularly&#13;
important. There is always the danger, however, that this information will be&#13;
used to prevent rather than adjust to change.&#13;
In sum, we find that much of what is described as "anticipatory"&#13;
assistance is either perfectly obvious-adjustment policy or unnecessary.&#13;
From our own point of view what is crucial is that the basic programs speci-&#13;
fying what is to be done in any particular case should have been decided in&#13;
advance and should operate smoothly. If they do not, it is unfortunately neces-&#13;
sary to anticipate specific changes, with all the problems that creates (as Braun&#13;
notes) if a package of support is to be available to those affected when necessary.&#13;
and adjustment is not to be delayed. Thus, what has to be anticipated is&#13;
not specific events like a rise in imports of socks, but that import surges&#13;
will occur, and, therefore, policies must exist that tell the government and&#13;
the industry affected what is to happen.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 214 -&#13;
C. Policies of Market-Substituting Interventionists&#13;
It seems to us that a blend of the free-market and interventionism&#13;
covers rather accurately the thinking of most policy-makers and the attitudes&#13;
of most developed countries (COECD, June 1979, passim). However,' there are&#13;
alternatives; there exists the idea of "structure preferences". While a&#13;
caricature, it is not totally unfair to describe "structure preferences",&#13;
in Europe at least, as "everything we have already got plus the industries&#13;
the Americans are competitive in like computers and aerospace." It is clear.&#13;
that from :'structure preferences" to pure defense is but a small step.   What&#13;
is interestitig about this idea is that recommendations of active intervention&#13;
from such authors as Mukherjee (1978) and UNCTAD (1978) essentially turn&#13;
"structure preferences" on their heah. Their idea is consciously to restructure&#13;
the developed countries to make ro61 for the exports of developing countries,&#13;
or in other words to impose a pre- rather .than.anti-trade "structure prefer-&#13;
ence".  Mukherjee remarks approvingly (1978, pp. 7i 8)m,"It isno exaggeration&#13;
to say that the call for a new international economic order is a proposal&#13;
for deliberate, determined and, most of all, anticipatory adaptation of&#13;
production structures by the dcs. A commitment to deliberate, systematic&#13;
and rapid industrial adaptation would be at least as much benefit to the&#13;
dcG as to the ldcs." The same autho.r clearly believes that the rapid growth&#13;
of interventionismD, eopecially in industry, of the past years is a product&#13;
of =navoidable defects itn he market (IbLd, p. 75), and that the only solution&#13;
to'the current problem is more concerted decision-making in the market. UNCTAD&#13;
(l978, p. 16) suggests that adaptation should follow sectoral studies, and&#13;
Include programs specially tailored to the needs of each group of affected&#13;
-dorkers, policies specific to each industry, special financial assistance on&#13;
a large scale, and other forms of direct management.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
215 -&#13;
We are extremely sceptical of the value of this approach in the&#13;
context of the individual countries. Unfortunately, most sectoral plans for&#13;
import-competing industry turn out, as one would expect, to be well-organized&#13;
pleas for protection. A recent example is the product of the United Kingdom's&#13;
contribution to the idea of negotiated sectoral change, namely the industry&#13;
working groups of the National Economic Development Organization (NEDO).&#13;
That on clothing has recently announced that the industry will function excel-&#13;
lently if the following requirements are met: "improved management and mar-&#13;
keting; achieving the improvements in productivity known to be possible; and&#13;
the effectiveness of the MFA bilaterals and their continuation beyond 1981,&#13;
when the present agreement expires" (Financial Times, January 30,-1978).&#13;
This bald plea comes from an industry which by its own admission has found it&#13;
impossible to retain skilled labor in a situation of general unemployment&#13;
(Ibid). Furthermore, what does "restructuring" mean? It is a continuous&#13;
process of unpredictable change.   It is quite certain that any specific&#13;
sectoral plan will be out of date by the time it is implemented. Indeed, it&#13;
is not clear how it is to be implemented, in any case, except by the creation&#13;
of the gamut of industry-specific policies, beloved by UNCTAD, whose effects&#13;
can never be predicted. It seems to us that those who desire this approach&#13;
wish the developed countries to adopt more closely the sort of centralized&#13;
planning characteristic of the Eastern European countries or the plethora of&#13;
product-and-industry-specific policies of many developing countries. Neither&#13;
seems suitable.&#13;
D. The International Dimension&#13;
It is obvious that what has been discussed has international&#13;
implications.    First, what is required is a general commitment&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 216 -&#13;
to adjustment. There is always a danger that the continuation of protec-&#13;
tionism by some large countries will make the problem for the rest almost&#13;
unmanageable. Such an international agreement is a fortiori necessary in&#13;
the EEC, where trade is a common policy issue. The approach to be taken is&#13;
presumably to agree not to take protectionist action but to use adjustment&#13;
assistance policies in specific circumstances, in which protection would&#13;
normally have been granted. GATT articles on "safeguards" would need to be&#13;
modified accordingly.&#13;
The developing countries themselves can do little to persuade the&#13;
developed to change their approach to matters of trade. Their main role&#13;
must consist of considering policies to raise the cost to the developed of&#13;
protection, and to lower the private costs of their market penetration.&#13;
With regard to the former, both retaliation and reciprocity need to be examined,&#13;
and with regard to the latter the aim must be to involve important groups in&#13;
the developed countries on their side. It may also be that what they have&#13;
to request would be more acceptable if it did not come under the guise of a&#13;
demand for "comprehensive restructuring", which can only increase fear while&#13;
being neither a necessary condition for success with their exports nor a&#13;
contribution to policy-making in developed countries.&#13;
E. Conclusion&#13;
The aim of adjustment policy is to lower social costs, redistribute&#13;
private costs and increase the political acceptability of a specific change,&#13;
namely, that created by import competition. Broadly speaking this can be&#13;
achieved by compensating those who lose and by reducing the social costs&#13;
associated with change. The last, in turn, can be secured by policy to&#13;
offset the differences between social and private costs with the aim of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 217 -&#13;
improving the working of the market or by more or less radical policies to&#13;
suppress or substitute for the market. In the context of the developed&#13;
countries the market is likely to be replaced by comprehensive fact-finding,&#13;
followed by negotiation about what change to accept, how to achieve it, and&#13;
who is to bear the costs.&#13;
Compensation of those adversely affected by the change is, in our&#13;
view, the corner-stone of any policy that aims at adjustment rather than&#13;
protection. It is clear that there are good arguments against compensation,&#13;
but it is important to recognize that the pilicy is not being recommended&#13;
in vacuo. Protection already exists or is likely to be increasingly used.&#13;
Given the existence of the distortion and the implicit admission that the&#13;
incomes of those affected should be maintained, compensation is the obvious&#13;
alternative.&#13;
Compensation cannot be given to everyone. It would be vastly&#13;
expensive and impossible to allocate. Instead, compensation in the form of&#13;
an unconditional lump sum should be offered to those who intend to quit the&#13;
industry. The sum to be offered need not equal the full private costs of&#13;
departure, partly because some possibility of exit exists even under&#13;
protection. For workers, the costs of job search, of a period of unemployment&#13;
and of reduced earnings in a new job would have to be taken into account.&#13;
For firms choosing liquidation or plant closure, the closest approximation&#13;
to reasonable compensation seems to be a proportion of the difference petween&#13;
the book value of assets (allowing for depreciation and inflation) and their&#13;
current market value. Where the costs faced by fixed factors are high,&#13;
emergency protection with a time limit or slow liberalization may be necessary.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 218 -&#13;
An appropriate policy should provide a general framework for&#13;
determining what to do in individual cases, and a procedure for ensuring&#13;
equitable treatment for all those in similar situations. The best approach&#13;
is a trade-related assistance program, under which firms in certain specified&#13;
situations and their workers would be entitled to compensation. The program&#13;
could be triggered in one of three ways: either by a decision to liberalize&#13;
imports of currently protected goods; or by a finding of injury to a range&#13;
of producers of certain goods; or by application from individual firms or&#13;
groups of workers not coming under the first two.&#13;
There are certain major advantages to a trade-related program&#13;
which permits assistance both to a "precertified" industry and to individual&#13;
firms. One is that assistance to firms will serve as an early warning&#13;
system which, along with monitoring of trends, will make it easier to deter-&#13;
mine when a whole industry is coming into difficulties. Secondly, it will&#13;
be easier to ensure consistency both within and across industries. Thus there&#13;
may be a general scale for all workers, depending only on pay, age, and&#13;
seniority. In addition, those who lose their jobs before an industry-wide&#13;
program is declared would also receive benefits, and the same applies to the&#13;
reduction in the value of capital. Finally, the machinery to deal with new&#13;
problems would exist, and would not-have to be created in each individual&#13;
case. The alternative is to have a series of industry-specific programs, in&#13;
which case it will be very important to monitor development carefully, since&#13;
otherwise great inequities within industries will arise.&#13;
Trade-related programs are infeasible in most smaller, more open&#13;
countries. For that reason it may be desirable to focus exclusively on&#13;
trade with developing countries. Further useful limitations of the program&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 219 -&#13;
can be achieved by restricting compensation to small firms and by providing&#13;
more generous compensation to those who are worst paid. It appears from some&#13;
very rough calculations we have made for the United States that a compen-&#13;
sation program for workers that focussed on those affected by imports from&#13;
developing countries, who tend to be relatively poorly paid, might cost&#13;
about $300,000,000 per annum, which is double the cost of worker compensation&#13;
under the current program (which covers all imports).&#13;
In the context of a greater degree of interventionism in the market&#13;
economy, a policy to reduce the social cost of change by correcting existing&#13;
distortions is inherently general and cannot usefully be applied only to&#13;
trade. Regional policies which exclude "sensitive" industries from incentives,&#13;
concentrate on the improvement of infrastructure, and lead to movement of&#13;
skilled labor into poorer regions, seem useful. Manpower policy might cover&#13;
general subsidies for employment through tax credits, replacement of some of&#13;
the conditional payments in social security systems by lump sums, subsidies&#13;
for on-the-job training and government finance and provision of such training,&#13;
and increased payment by firms to those redundant, in recognition of the&#13;
social costs thereby created. Worker mobility can best be increased by&#13;
policies that mitigate the effect of obstacles inherent in current practices&#13;
in such areas as pensions and housing. Much assistance for industrial&#13;
restructuring seems wasteful and essentially defensive, but governments may&#13;
help by subsidizing firms' research and development, financing basic scientific&#13;
research, and encouraging investment. In certain cases conscious policy to&#13;
choose the vinners of the future could be useful. However, it is clear that&#13;
government intervention has often slowed change and Increased the conflicts&#13;
both within and among nations over economic policy.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 220 -&#13;
Given a trade-related adjustment program, it is possible to go&#13;
beyond compensation and introduce more activist elements. Firms judged eli-&#13;
gible might be given loans for restructuring their businesses or help in&#13;
relocating overseas. In general, subsidies seem undesirable, but long&#13;
maturities might be provided on loans. If the firm were to be helped for&#13;
restructuring within the economy it makes sense to restrict the decline in&#13;
employment, maintenance of thelatter being the purported aim of the assistance.&#13;
Technical assistance can also be provided. Programs can be developed to help&#13;
communities affected by trade.   Affected workers can be offered special&#13;
subsidies for training or relocation. However, it should be stressed that&#13;
all these elements cannot be seen as a substitute for compensation but as&#13;
complements.&#13;
There is a great deal of discussion of "anticipatory" adjustment&#13;
assistance but the various authors appear to be talking at cross purposes.&#13;
Our own proposals cover most of what people have in mind. In particular,&#13;
general regional, manpower, industrial and trade-related compensation and&#13;
assistance policies provide a framework to deal with specific events, and&#13;
are thus "anticipatory".    It does not seem to us to be particularly&#13;
important to identify vulnerable industries before anything has happened, if&#13;
the general programs are already in place. However, if reliance is to be&#13;
on industry-specific programs, then monitoring of trends and establishment&#13;
of the program early is important, if only for reasons of inter-firm and&#13;
inter-personal equity. We need only point to the resentment of United Kingdom&#13;
textile firms who had scrapped and modernized prior to the Act of 1959.&#13;
The general approach outlined this far is to employ policy to&#13;
improve the workings of the market, and this may be attacked from two sides.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 221 -&#13;
On the one hand, there are those who wish to rely on the market alone in the&#13;
belief that most government interventionism is a cure worse than the disease,&#13;
or, still worse, is the cure that brings on the disease. Further compensation&#13;
alone might be acceptable combined with less intervention. On the other hand,&#13;
there are those who favor the imposition of "structure preferences" on the&#13;
market. In the developed countries most of these are strongly protectionist&#13;
in temper. In the developing countries' camp are those who wish to impose&#13;
a "structure preference" in favor of the imports from the poorer countries.&#13;
We are extremely sceptical of the value of this approach, involving as it&#13;
usually does comprehensive sectoral plans, negotiation among all those&#13;
affected, and programs for each industry and group of workers. In practice,&#13;
such programs are likely to provide clarion calls for protection, to be&#13;
irrelevant by the time they are implemented, to be incapable of actual imple-&#13;
mentation, as well as to be grossly inefficient. Furthermore, the entire&#13;
approach seems unsuitable to countries in which it is often the case that it&#13;
is the market that makes things happen, and government that prevents-,them.&#13;
The only exceptions are the successful programs of development of the firms&#13;
and industries of the future, (rather- than involvement with the senescent),&#13;
of such countries as Japan and France, which can play a useful role-in&#13;
complementing the market.&#13;
All that we have proposed requires international agreements,&#13;
especially among the developed countries.   Trade policies will need modifi-&#13;
cation in a number of countries simultaneously, since otherwise the activity&#13;
of one will be swamped by trade diversion created by the protection of the&#13;
others.  Developing countries must also consider how to raise the political&#13;
cost of protection to governments in developed countries.&#13;

        </repnme>
        <abstracts>
            This study examines the problem posed by
            the need to adjust to imports from developing countries. It
            begins with an attempt to define the terms of adjustment and
            adjustment policy. The overall context within which
            adjustment has to occur is then discussed, and attention is
            drawn both to the unfavorable macroeconomic environment and
            to the bias against changes brought about by imports from
            developing countries. The theory of adjustment costs and
            their political implications is examined, followed by a
            review of the evidence on the exact impact of the exports of
            manufactures from developing countries and on the nature of
            the protectionist response as a political phenomenon. This
            leads to a definition of the possible forms and goals of
            adjustment policy. The effectiveness of existing policies is
            reviewed, immediately following a discussion of the relevant
            differences between major developed countries. Finally
            conclusions are drawn about what improved adjustment policy
            might consist of in different country contexts.
