1. SECTOR BACKGROUND AND ISSUES&#13;
A. BACKGROUND&#13;
1.1   China has achieved well known gains in education. With an enrollment of 132&#13;
million pupils and 5.6 million teachers in about 668,700 primary schools, China runs the&#13;
largest primary school system in the world. At the junior secondary level there are&#13;
67,000 schools with an enrollment of 46.6 million pupils and 2.8 million teachers. In&#13;
1995, overall national net enrollment rates for the first nine years of schooling were 98.5&#13;
percent of the 6-11 age cohort enrolled in primary education, and more than 78.4 percent&#13;
of the 12-15 age cohort in junior secondary schools. Of primary graduates, 90.8 percent&#13;
went on to middle schools (regular or vocational). Almost 98.2 percent of all school-age&#13;
girls have been enrolled in primary education. A significant consequence of these high&#13;
enrollment figures is the high literacy rates: 80 percent for those above 15 years of age&#13;
and about 93 percent among those between 15 and 25 years of age. The projected figures&#13;
for 2000 are 135 million pupils at primary level and 55 million at junior secondary level.&#13;
1.2   Global figures, though indicative of substantial progress, tend to mask disparities&#13;
in basic education development, with noticeable imbalances in the availability of&#13;
educational services between the economically advanced and underdeveloped regions.&#13;
Generally, urban and coastal areas have achieved the goal of nine-year basic education,&#13;
but many poor, sparsely-populated and remote areas have not achieved the primary&#13;
education targets. Schooling in poor counties is marked by poor attendance and high&#13;
repetition and drop-out rates. Although net enrollment rates for primary school-age&#13;
children in several autonomous regions exceed the national average of 98.5, five&#13;
provinces-Gansu, Guizhou, Qinghai, Sichuan and Yunnan-and three autonomous&#13;
regions-Ningxia, Tibet and Xinjiang-lag far behind. Regional disparities are even&#13;
more conspicuous in completion rates, i.e., the proportion of children entering first grade&#13;
who eventually graduate from primary school. While the national average for the&#13;
completion rate in 1991-92 was estimated at 91 percent, it ranged between 78.6 percent in&#13;
Jiangxi Province and 99.7 percent in Beijing.&#13;
1.3   Among the deprived sections of the population, minorities and girls and women&#13;
continue to be more disadvantaged. For example, a study of 25 minority counties shows&#13;
that the gross enrollment rate of school aged minority children was 20 percentage points&#13;
lower than the national mean, with female enrollment particularly low. Facilities for&#13;
basic education are equally available for both boys and girls, yet there is a significantly&#13;
lower level of utilization of facilities by girls. Almost half the rural population is literate&#13;
or semi-literate, the illiteracy rate for women being 70 percent. Enrollment rates for girls&#13;
in minority areas can reach 20 to 30 percent less than for boys. The number of female&#13;
teachers in rural minority areas tends to be about one third of that of male teachers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B. SECTOR REFORM AGENDA&#13;
1.4   Educational development is a major instrument in China's drive for&#13;
modernization to the end of this century and the early stage of the 21st century.&#13;
Educational reforms and development, responsive to the changing human capital&#13;
demands of the growing economy, were encapsulated in a series of policy and legal&#13;
documents, such as "Decision to Reform the Educational Structure" (1985), "Compulsory&#13;
Education Law" (1986), "Outline for Reform and Development of Education" (1993),&#13;
and "Education Law" (1995). The current reforms relevant to basic education focus on&#13;
the following areas: (a) the provision of Nine Years' Compulsory Education for all&#13;
school-age children; (b) the development of vocational and technical education at the&#13;
secondary and postsecondary levels; (c) the strengthening of education management at all&#13;
levels by strengthening the role of principals and local authorities in the design of the&#13;
reforms, and transferring the responsibility for providing basic education to local&#13;
governments under the central government's policy guidance and financial support;&#13;
(d) the great increase of investment in basic education by the governments at all levels;&#13;
(e) the continuous improvement and gradual standardization of school operational&#13;
conditions; (f) the enhancement of teachers quality by further strengthening of teachers'&#13;
education and training. The State Education Commission (SEdC), created in June 1986&#13;
as- the successor to the Ministry of Education (MOE) and responsible nationally for&#13;
policy, budgeting and coordination of this sector, therefore has the mission of overseeing&#13;
the above reforms at the national level.&#13;
C. MAJOR ISSUES AND CONSTRAINTS&#13;
1.5   The goal of universalization of basic education in poor counties has to contend&#13;
with a number of key sector issues and constraints, many of which are due to the diversity&#13;
of conditions in different parts of China. Rural poverty exacerbates such conditions.&#13;
Further, the reforms call for a number of administrative changes for which local&#13;
management capacity will have to be developed. Weak educational outcomes signal low&#13;
returns to investment and a failure to capture the significant benefits in poverty reduction,&#13;
economic development and social returns that basic education has been shown to generate&#13;
internationally. This section is based on extensive Bank Group economic and sector&#13;
work' completed for the first basic education project (Education Development in Poor&#13;
Provinces (CR. 2339-CHA) (EDPP) and work carried out by major Chinese research&#13;
institutions and scholars, and economic and financial analyses, including household&#13;
education spending surveys carried out during the Third and the current proposed Fourth&#13;
Basic Education Projects (BEIV). With ranging emphases, all four basic education&#13;
projects have been designed to address the following issues and constraints.&#13;
A detailed discussion of these issues can be found in China: Provincial Education Sector Planning and&#13;
Finance, Sector Study. The World Bank, China and Mongolia Departnent. Report No. 8657-CHA,&#13;
1991.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
(a)   Access. Limited access to complete primary schools in poor and minority&#13;
areas continues to be a constraining factor to rural education development&#13;
in the nine project provinces Guizhou, Hainan, Heilongjiang, Hunan,&#13;
Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan and Yunnan. Schools offering full&#13;
primary education programs are not always within reasonable walking&#13;
distance from the homes of children in these areas. About 30 percent of&#13;
the rural primary schools in project counties are incomplete schools, i.e.,&#13;
they do not offer the full primary program and some offer only three or&#13;
even fewer grades. Small villages are served by "teaching points" which&#13;
offer only two grades, 1 and 3 or 2 and 4: project counties currently have&#13;
10,093 such "teaching points". Since complete primary schools may be&#13;
located 4-5 kilometers away from small villages and boarding schools are&#13;
costly, many children tend to discontinue their education after attending an&#13;
incomplete school, particularly girls from poor households. Improving&#13;
access to primary schooling will require continuing efforts to provide&#13;
better classroom and teacher capacity.&#13;
(b)   Poverty. Children from poor households are educationally disadvantaged,&#13;
compared with those from wealthier households. Their enrollment,&#13;
retention and completion rates are lower, and their dropout rates higher.&#13;
The education gap in rural areas is largely caused by the inability of&#13;
parents to afford the direct and indirect costs of schooling for their&#13;
children. Data from the Household Education Spending (HES) survey&#13;
(AnnexJ1) suggest that a household could spend as much as 20 percent of&#13;
their annual income. Parents responding to the survey identified low&#13;
incomes as the major reason for non-enrollment of their children.&#13;
(c)   Inequities. Gender disparity persists both in Han and minority societies:&#13;
about 70 percent of the 7-11 age cohort who are not enrolled in schools are&#13;
girls. This is more evident in eight provinces and autonomous regions&#13;
which include Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Ningxia, Qinghai, Sichuan,&#13;
Tibet, and Yunnan. A significant proportion of the population in these&#13;
regions belong to national minorities and broadly reflects the relatively&#13;
wider gender gap in enrollment rate among the minority groups. The&#13;
completion rates for boys and girls in 1991-92 were 94.2 percent and 89.3&#13;
percent respectively with girls constituting about 75 percent of drop-outs&#13;
from the primary cycle. While the literacy rate for male population of 15&#13;
years and older was 87 percent in 1990, it was only 68.1 percent for&#13;
females.  Sociocultural attitudes among some communities towards&#13;
education of girls, the relatively poor recognition of the benefits of&#13;
education for girls, school fees which constitute a substantial amount of&#13;
meager resources, need to assist families with income-generating&#13;
activities, and parental hesitation to send girls to co-educational schools&#13;
without female teachers are some of the reasons for lower enrollment and&#13;
retention rates for girls, especially those belonging to disadvantaged&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-4-&#13;
population groups. The perceived lack of relevance of the school program&#13;
to the future development and occupational needs of girls also have&#13;
important bearing on attitudes to schooling.&#13;
(d)   Quality. Teacher effectiveness is limited. Nationally about 89 percent of&#13;
primary school teachers meet State-prescribed qualifications: however&#13;
regional disparities range from 94 percent in Liaoning to 49 percent in&#13;
Tibet. The average figure for project counties at this time is 66.5 percent&#13;
for primary school teachers and 33.4 percent for junior secondary.&#13;
Training courses are historically strong on content and weak on the&#13;
development of pedagogical skills.   Few  programs offer trainees&#13;
instructional methodologies suited to rural schools nor provide skills for&#13;
adapting the curriculum, prescribed teaching materials and equipment to&#13;
local conditions. Courses in multigrade teaching and bilingual instruction,&#13;
the latter required in minority schools, are not sufficiently widespread.&#13;
This often emphasizes the cultural discontinuity between school and&#13;
home, language of instruction and mother tongue. More than 37 percent&#13;
of primary school teachers are minban (community supported) teachers,&#13;
about 88 percent of whom are in rural areas. While significant efforts&#13;
have been made to develop a training network to periodically reorient&#13;
teachers to curriculum and methodological innovations, opportunities for&#13;
in-service training for experienced teachers in poor, remote and minority&#13;
areas continue to be inadequate. Teachers (and trainers) tend to be ill-&#13;
prepared to meet the diversity of individual pupil needs.  Science&#13;
education in rural schools remains weak relying largely on rote&#13;
memorization, and extremely disadvantaged in comparison with the&#13;
modernized facilities, equipment and techniques available in urban&#13;
schools. Consumable supplies and educational aids are either absent, or, if&#13;
available, under-utilized.&#13;
(e)   Low Efficiency. Rural primary and lower secondary schools are more&#13;
inefficient than their urban counterparts. This is evidenced by low&#13;
student-teacher ratios, incomplete schools, low completion rates, and low&#13;
girls' enrollments particularly in minority schools. A survey of 328&#13;
counties in 1992 found an inverse correlation between net income per&#13;
capita and drop-out and repetition rates; the lower the net income, the&#13;
higher the drop-out and repetition rates. Some estimates show that nearly&#13;
one-third of the children who enter grade 1 in poor areas drop out before&#13;
completing grade 5. Inadequately planned and managed teacher training&#13;
programs, both at pre-service and in-service levels, especially in poor rural&#13;
areas with relatively high levels of minority population, continue to hinder&#13;
progress towards universalization. Generally, there are no mechanisms to&#13;
identify efficiency-related issues and to provide and monitor corrective&#13;
measures.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
(f)   Inadequate Financing.  Educational services which are seriously&#13;
underfinanced and which provide inadequate schooling facilities in poor&#13;
counties are a significant measure of urban-rural disparities. Buildings are&#13;
in such poor physical condition that they are listed officially as&#13;
"dangerous". In the Third Basic Education (Cr. 2831 -CHA) (BEIII)&#13;
project counties, 6 percent of primary schools and 5 percent of junior&#13;
secondary schools are officially listed as dangerous buildings. The school&#13;
environment is not conducive to learning; bilingual instruction facilities&#13;
are lacking in minority areas; costs of books have risen and instructional&#13;
equipment is scarce. The average figure for project county schools&#13;
meeting equipment standards for primary level is 52 percent decreasing to&#13;
32 percent for junior secondary schools. Distribution of teachers is uneven&#13;
between urban and rural areas; the low pay of minban teachers in poor&#13;
communities results in low motivation and a high turnover, resulting in&#13;
instability. Although average annual increase in real expenditure has&#13;
increased, most of this has funded teacher salaries and not better quality&#13;
instructional inputs to provide an effective learning environment.&#13;
(g)   Weak Management Capacity. The reform agenda (see para. 1.4) has&#13;
important implications for education management as Nine Year&#13;
Compulsory Education implementation accelerates to meet goals set for&#13;
2000. Inadequate management capacity for planning, implementing,&#13;
monitoring and evaluating reform programs for universalization of basic&#13;
education poses difficulties in poor counties. Several tiers of government&#13;
and administration are involved (central, provincial, county, village and&#13;
educational institution) which make management tasks complex:&#13;
appropriate structures are lacking to facilitate the systematic involvement&#13;
and assistance of the community in the planning and implementation of&#13;
primary education programs. While the SEdC management capacity has&#13;
been strengthened since the preparation of the first basic education project,&#13;
at a number of management levels there are shortages of qualified and&#13;
experienced planners, data-processors, statisticians and analysts.&#13;
Educational statistics and data on education financing, on school facilities,&#13;
and on staff deployment are often incomplete or inaccurate and therefore&#13;
provide insufficient information to identify and resolve efficiency&#13;
problems such as wasteful student to staff ratios, low teaching loads, low&#13;
utilization rates of facilities and equipment.&#13;
D. GOVERNMENT STRATEGY, POLICIES AND PROGRAMS&#13;
1.6   The Central Government's approach to address the above issues and constraints is&#13;
to develop broad principles and regulations to guide provincial and local governments&#13;
developing their county and village level education services, so that they may implement&#13;
the Compulsory Education Law using the resources available, and pursue their own&#13;
targets, according to their own means. Principles to be encouraged at the national level&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 6 -&#13;
include access/equity, quality and efficiency: (a) access/equity issues include State efforts&#13;
to subsidize economically undeveloped areas so that they may introduce, and where&#13;
necessary, expand compulsory education and to encourage the transfers of funds from&#13;
provincial to local governments; (b) quality improvement includes the introduction of&#13;
newly developed sets of more relevant and adequate books for basic education, training&#13;
of teachers to use the new text materials and provision of more pre-service and improved&#13;
in-service training for teachers; and (c) efficiency is seen as increased cost-effectiveness&#13;
in school management by reducing high repetition and drop-out rates, and adopting&#13;
adequate student-teacher ratios and teacher workloads.&#13;
1.7   Government's Education Strategy for Poverty Areas.  According to the&#13;
Education Law, the most important basic law in education which became effective on&#13;
September 1, 1995, the Government is charged with supporting and assisting the&#13;
development of education for national minorities as well as remote and poverty stricken&#13;
areas (Article 10). In keeping with the "Outline for Reform and Development of&#13;
Education in China," the State Council issued detailed suggestions in 1994 on the&#13;
implementation and planning for universalization of basic education, especially in poor&#13;
areas, which has been undertaken on the basis of different timescales, according to the&#13;
status of economic development as indicated in the following four categories:&#13;
(a)   Category 1: cities and selected rural areas with a fairly high level of&#13;
economic development and covering 40 percent of the nation's population.&#13;
Universalization targets in these areas are expected to be achieved by&#13;
1997.&#13;
(b)   Category 2: rural areas with medium level of economic development and&#13;
covering another 40 percent of the population. This category has already&#13;
achieved universal compulsory primary education and expects to meet&#13;
nine-year targets by 2000.&#13;
(c)   Category 3: rural areas with low levels of economic development&#13;
covering 15 percent of the country's population. For about 5 percent of&#13;
this group, in areas with a good primary education system, the nine-year&#13;
goal should be achieved by 2000. For the remaining 10 percent of this&#13;
group, efforts will be made to implement five or six years of basic&#13;
education.&#13;
(d)   Category 4: exceptionally poverty-stricken areas covering 5 percent of the&#13;
population. Efforts will be made to implement three to four year primary&#13;
education by 2000.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
1.8  In order to reach overall universalization of basic education, targets proposed by&#13;
the State Council, SEdC will increase nonrecurrent categorical2 budgetary expenditures in&#13;
all provinces with nationally designated poor counties so that they can achieve universal&#13;
basic education by the year 2000. This is called the "Basic Education Program in Poor&#13;
Areas" and funding will be used for school construction, provision of teaching equipment&#13;
and library books, and teacher and principal training.&#13;
1.9   The special national fund established to finance the Basic Education Program in&#13;
Poor Areas amounted to 200 million yuan in 1995, and, by 1997, the additional resources&#13;
will amount to 800 million yuan. Between 1996-2000, SEdC will provide a total of 3.9&#13;
billion yuan to poor counties, with a matching 7.8 billion yuan expected from provinces&#13;
and counties. The additional funds will be used for capital, nonrecurrent costs of&#13;
improvement in school facilities, and the provision of equipment, furniture, and books.&#13;
1.10 The SEdC has adopted the International Development Association's (IDA) project&#13;
preparation and management procedure in deciding what basic education projects to&#13;
support with funds from the special fund and in managing the distribution of these funds&#13;
to the provinces. The SEdC now requires that provinces submit applications for funds&#13;
which are to be used in poverty areas, plans on how the funds are to be used, indicators&#13;
on their use, with full annual review and reporting on outcomes. As Beijing, Tianjin,&#13;
Shanghai, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jilin, Liaoning and Shandong have almost&#13;
achieved the goal of universalization of nine-year compulsory education, SEdC is&#13;
implementing the Basic Education Program in Poor Areas with a two-phase strategy:&#13;
- Phase One (1995-98) focuses on Category 2 poor counties in the 12 provinces of&#13;
Anhui, Fujian, Hainan, Hebei, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Shaanxi,&#13;
Shanxi and Sichuan. These provinces account for approximately 40 percent of&#13;
China's population. There are 289 "8/7 Counties"3 in Phase One with a population of&#13;
some 110 million. The emphasis in Phase One is on junior secondary schooling.&#13;
* Phase Two (1995 through 1998 to 2000 and beyond) will focus on Category 3&#13;
counties in the nine provinces and autonomous regions of Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou,&#13;
Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Qinghai, Tibet, Xinjiang and Yunnan, accounting for some&#13;
190 million population. There are 273 "8/7 Counties" in Phase Two with a poor&#13;
population of some 70 million. By 2000, 66 percent of Category 3 population would&#13;
have been covered, which will mean that almost 91 percent of the nation will have&#13;
2 Categorical funding refers to special targeted funding from the central government for school&#13;
construction and rehabilitation, and teacher training in national minority areas, national poor counties,&#13;
and former revolutionary base areas.&#13;
3 In January 1995 the Nine Year Compulsory Education (NYCE) by the Year 2000 policy statement&#13;
focused on achieving universal basic education in the 592 poor counties identified in the National Plan&#13;
to Reduce Poverty by the Year 2000 (the "8/7 plan", and hence "8/7 counties").&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-8 -&#13;
nine-year compulsory education coverage. The government's strategy for Category 4&#13;
population areas is to include them in Phase Two.&#13;
1.11   Since the focus for Phase One provinces is the achievement of Nine Year&#13;
Compulsory Education (NYCE), the proposed project will, compared with its&#13;
predecessors, have increased emphases on junior secondary schooling (grades 6-9 the last&#13;
three years of compulsory education). For Phase Two some 44 percent of provinces&#13;
would not have been covered by 2000, with the possibility of those in the poorest areas&#13;
receiving 4 years of education. Taking situational realities into account, the project has&#13;
been designed sufficiently flexibly to accommodate the varying priorities.&#13;
1.12 The Government's efforts include: (a) specially earmarked national funds for&#13;
construction and rehabilitation of schools in poor areas; (b) upgrading the professional&#13;
qualifications of minban teachers so that they can be converted to gongban (government&#13;
supported) teachers; (c) specially targeted funds to support payment of charges for books,&#13;
meals in boarding schools, and some transportation costs; (d) training of education&#13;
managers at the provincial and county level in methods to achieve efficiency gains by&#13;
using better resource allocation strategies and practices; and, (e) introduction of tax&#13;
reforms which broaden and deepen the base for tax collection, earmark percentages for&#13;
compulsory education, and allow for targeting of funds toward the poorer sections of the&#13;
provinces.&#13;
1.13   Government Strategy for Minority Education.  The evolution of China's&#13;
strategy for the provision of education for ethnic minorities has undergone changes in the&#13;
past four decades. For instance, in areas with large minority populations, there is&#13;
increasing use of minority languages as the initial medium of instruction at primary level,&#13;
with significant usage for classroom instruction although less widespread at secondary&#13;
level. The percentage of local content in primary school textbooks has been increased,&#13;
and levels of government-both local and national-support of teachers' salaries in&#13;
predominantly minority areas have been increased. Also, since the 1970's there has been&#13;
an increased recruitment of minority teachers and school principals, and greater efforts&#13;
made to train bilingual teachers.&#13;
1.14 Government policy on minority education can be seen in a number of other&#13;
systematic policy foci: (a) expanding access through: construction, expansion and&#13;
renovation of township/village schools, teaching points and multigrade-schools;&#13;
mandating universal 6-year education in all minority regions or an elementary graduate&#13;
per household as a minimum requirement for remote and scattered rural inhabitation;&#13;
development of a Center4 Elementary School for every township in each minority county&#13;
and a Center Secondary School and a Literacy and Vocational Training Center for each&#13;
minority county; (b) improving delivery and relevance of educational inputs by:&#13;
4 "Center" schools are generally town or county center level schools with additional faculty and funding&#13;
provided by the province or county to act as inservice teacher and principal training, local curricula&#13;
development and instructional equipment training sites.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 9 -&#13;
improving teacher selection and preparation in pedagogy, bilingual education, curriculum&#13;
revision and development of bilingual materials for minorities; and (c) increasing the&#13;
resource base by developing preferential policies of increased national and provincial&#13;
resource allocation targeted at basic education in poor minority regions for specific&#13;
programs to reduce repetition and drop-out rates.&#13;
1.15 Government Strategy for Promoting Education of Girls. In the "Law of the&#13;
People's Republic of China on the Protection of Rights and Interests of Women," which&#13;
became effective on October 1, 1992, the Government recognizes the education of girls as&#13;
a societal responsibility. The Law states that: (a) "schools and departments concerned&#13;
shall, by implementing the relevant regulations of the state, guarantee that women enjoy&#13;
equal rights with men in such aspects as starting school, entering a higher school, job&#13;
assignment upon graduation, conferment of academic degrees and dispatch for study&#13;
abroad "(Article 15)"; and (b) "the governments, society and schools shall, in the light of&#13;
the actual difficulties of female school-age children or adolescents in schooling, take&#13;
effective measures to ensure that female school-age children or adolescents receive&#13;
compulsory education for the number of years locally prescribed" (Article 17).&#13;
1.16  Several other measures have been taken to create a supportive environment for the&#13;
promotion of girls' education. Legal protection for the rights and interests of women and&#13;
girls is enshrined in the Compulsory Education Law and The Law Regarding the Health&#13;
Care of Mother and Infants. The State Council issued the "Outline for Women&#13;
Development in China" right before the UN Fourth Conference on Women in Beijing,&#13;
and further highlighted the importance of girls' education to women's development and&#13;
social status. Publicity drives have been initiated and the Chinese Government has&#13;
expressed its determination to keep girls' dropout rate and lack of attendance to under&#13;
two percent. Teacher training is being strengthened, especially for female teachers and&#13;
principals. Social action in the form of financial assistance through the "Hope Project"&#13;
and the "Spring Bud Plan" illustrate national efforts to help retain girls in school by&#13;
lowering direct costs of schooling to parents.&#13;
1.17  In addition, a UNICEF-assisted project "Promoting Education of Girls in Poor&#13;
Areas," started in 1992, is being implemented in selected townships in 101 counties in&#13;
nine provinces (Anhui, Gansu, Guangxi, Guizhou, Ningxia, Qinghai, Shaanxi, Sichuan&#13;
and Yunnan). Specific strategies adopted under the project include, among others,&#13;
campaigns to generate parental awareness of the benefits of girls' education and to&#13;
overcome the socioeconomic barriers hindering participation of girls in education,&#13;
mobilization of parents and community leaders in activities designed to enhance&#13;
enrollment and retention of girls in schools, further increasing the proportion of trained&#13;
female teachers and principals and incorporation into the school curriculum learning&#13;
content that would enable girls to acquire the knowledge and skills relevant to their&#13;
socioeconomic needs; specific measures implemented in minority areas of Ningxia&#13;
include establishment of single-sex schools and single-sex classes and promoting&#13;
participation of religious leaders in enrollment campaigns and school improvement&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
activities. Activities under the proposed project would help in enhancing enrollment and&#13;
retention of girls in the areas covered.&#13;
1.18 Assessment of Government Commitment. In addition to laws, policies, goals&#13;
and achievement criteria outlined above, recent actions have confirmed the government's&#13;
commitment to achieving universal basic education by the year 2000. In March 1995 the&#13;
Chinese National People's Congress passed the new Education Law which confirms these&#13;
ambitious goals for the year 2000 and directs the central, provincial and county&#13;
governments to develop educational programs which will achieve the goals. The Bank&#13;
preparation mission has reviewed the Government's Nine Year Compulsory Education&#13;
Plan and the Education Law and is in fundamental agreement with their content, direction&#13;
and intent. Over the last 15 years, processes and mechanisms established for planning,&#13;
implementation and management of earlier education projects have helped to develop&#13;
management capacity at the center and project provinces. This augurs well for the&#13;
remaining preparatory work and implementation. The earlier basic education projects&#13;
were developed and prepared within the same education policy context and the current&#13;
project furthers and strengthens the Bank's support for the Government's program of&#13;
improving China's Basic Education System.&#13;
E. RATIONALE FOR IDA INVOLVEMENT&#13;
1.19 The Bank Group (IBRD and IDA) is in general agreement with the direction taken&#13;
by China in developing its educational policies and system at all levels. It provides&#13;
support to this process by maintaining a dialogue on sectoral issues and options, and by&#13;
supporting selected activities which contribute to access/equity, quality and efficiency. In&#13;
order to facilitate achievement of these ends, the Association's country assistance strategy&#13;
in the education sector in China is to: (a) support basic education with particular attention&#13;
to increasing access to quality schooling for the poor, minorities, and girls; (b) improve&#13;
the effectiveness of teaching services including the upgrading of educational&#13;
management, support services for principals and teachers, and teacher training; (c) assist&#13;
in the design and implementation of reforms in the education sector, especially in seeking&#13;
more equitable funding mechanisms, targeted to basic education in poor rural areas; and&#13;
(d) support institution building to increase the capacity of educational authorities at all&#13;
levels to carry out their responsibilities, especially under conditions of increasing&#13;
operational decentralization.&#13;
1.20 Rationale for IDA Involvement. This proposed lending operation is consistent&#13;
with the sector assistance strategy described above and the CAS discussed by the Board&#13;
on March 18, 1997. In particular, the project will support the poverty reduction and&#13;
human resources development objectives of the CAS, and will help the Government to&#13;
implement the National Poverty Reduction Plan (8/7 Plan). IDA's ongoing support to&#13;
China's efforts in improving basic education in poor and remote areas, including those&#13;
inhabited by minority nationalities, has been effective in improving the design and&#13;
implementation of such efforts. The proposed project would be consistent with the&#13;
findings of the Bank's report, "China: Strategies for Reducing Poverty in the 1990s,"&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
which identifies investment in human capital, in particular targeted intervention to the&#13;
poor and vulnerable, as a key component of poverty alleviation efforts, leading to&#13;
healthier and smaller families, higher rates of adopting new agricultural technology, and&#13;
increased access to alternative off-farm employment. The project also incorporates&#13;
IDA's concern for improving the status of women in the development process.&#13;
1.21  Past Bank Group Involvement in the Sector. In line with the above assistance&#13;
strategy, since 1981 the Bank Group has supported 18 projects in China that were either&#13;
devoted entirely to the education sector or had substantial education sector components.&#13;
More recently, as part of an integrated poverty reduction project, IDA is assisting the&#13;
development of primary education in the Southwest Property Reduction Project (Cr.&#13;
2744-CHA). The total loan and credit amount for education to date is $1,538.8 million.&#13;
Since the early 1980s, the trend in assistance has moved from other education subsectors&#13;
to basic education in poverty areas. These projects include 8 tertiary education projects,&#13;
two teacher training, two technical and vocational training, one on textbook development&#13;
for the basic level, one provincial development project and one municipality level&#13;
development project each of which includes an education component, and three for basic&#13;
education in poverty areas. The fourth basic education project comes on the heels of the&#13;
second (1995) and third (1996) basic education projects in support of the Government's&#13;
own recognition of education development as a major instrument in the eradication of&#13;
poverty.&#13;
1.22  Sector studies related to education finance were completed in 1986, 1991 and&#13;
1995. Other sector studies were done on technical/vocational education and training for&#13;
labor markets in 1987 and 1993, respectively, and informal sector work on teacher&#13;
training was carried out in 1991. Institutional Development Fund (IDF) grants have also&#13;
contributed to financial and curricula reform initiatives. These, combined with extensive&#13;
experience in preparing and supervising projects over the past decade, provide&#13;
considerable background for identification of sectoral needs and opportunities.&#13;
F. BANK EXPERIENCE AND LESSONS LEARNED&#13;
1.23  Lessons from Past Experience in China. Much of the same national level SEdC&#13;
project development team and the Chinese advisory group which worked on the EDPP,&#13;
Basic Education in Poor and Minority Areas (BEII) (Cr. 2651 -CHA) and BEIII projects is&#13;
intact and continues to work on the development of the current project. This staffing&#13;
continuity has facilitated incorporation into the proposed project design of valuable&#13;
lessons leamed from the development and early implementation of the EDPP, BEII,&#13;
BEIII projects. Similarly, many of the Bank Group and Chinese staff who worked on the&#13;
former project now work on the latter. The lessons include the following: (a) projects are&#13;
better designed and implemented when they concentrate on a reduced number of&#13;
provinces, and when provincial and county authorities are involved in their design;&#13;
(b) provincial level counterpart funding must be assured from the beginning of the&#13;
project, available early and sufficient to provide necessary start-up funds for county and&#13;
village civil works which account for a large percentage of the first half of project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12-&#13;
disbursements in such education projects; (c) the project oversight and policy guidance&#13;
role of the Chinese Experts Panel (CEP) has been critical in making minor but necessary&#13;
adjustments in project design, advising Bank supervision missions, and resolving&#13;
implementation problems at the provincial and sub-provincial levels; (d) Provincial&#13;
Education Commissions (PEdC) should concentrate less on quantitative targets and more&#13;
on improving the quality of the project-supported pre-service and in-service teacher&#13;
training; (e) provinces have tended to over-rely on early and heavy use of force account&#13;
for small civil works projects in locations where National Competitive Bidding (NCB)&#13;
procurement procedures would have been more appropriate and economical; (f) the&#13;
Association and the Government need to work together in the evaluation of education&#13;
reforms. Work has started on developing a standardized mechanism to measure student&#13;
attendance and indicators of educational achievement progress; and (g) national&#13;
coordination of technical assistance, high level training, collection of educational and&#13;
project indicators, and dissemination of lessons learned is necessary to achieve&#13;
efficiencies of scale, and country-wide coherence in the development and expression of&#13;
education policy and national standards (Annex2).&#13;
1.24 Lessons from International Experience. Project completion reports as well as&#13;
project audits undertaken by the Bank's Operations Evaluation Department (OED), for&#13;
completed education projects worldwide include a variety of important lessons which can&#13;
be summarized as follows: (a) follow-up projects pursuing similar objectives to those of&#13;
previous projects help to strengthen and eventually consolidate earlier achievements,&#13;
which might otherwise falter and dissipate. Thus, follow-up projects should be part of a&#13;
long-term investment program with clearly defined objectives based on sound sector&#13;
work; (b) implementing agencies should have a strong sense of project ownership;&#13;
(c) borrowers should be committed to providing the necessary resources to support basic&#13;
education on a sustained basis; (d) project design should be sufficiently flexible to&#13;
accommodate mid-course corrections in scope, content and approach; (e) expert advisory&#13;
panels should be established to review implementation, address implementation issues,&#13;
and recommend on mid-course corrections; (f) increasing access for poor and minority&#13;
children and girls to quality primary education must be addressed by innovative&#13;
enrollment policies and student assistance programs.&#13;
1.25  The Proposed Project. The proposed project design benefited from the above&#13;
lessons by incorporating the following points: (a) the borrower and provincial education&#13;
authorities have been responsible for organizing the participation of stakeholders at the&#13;
provincial and county levels to develop proposals based on local identification of issues&#13;
and optimal solutions. Because this project is part of a unified program of projects in&#13;
basic education, this process was facilitated by using experienced staff, educational&#13;
advisors and models from earlier projects; (b) a CEP has been used to assist in the design&#13;
of project components and will be used during project implementation to provide ongoing&#13;
high level professional monitoring of project implementation; (c) a county financing&#13;
study and household survey has been completed to better understand what the necessary&#13;
government and non-government commitment is for sustaining appropriate levels of&#13;
support for basic education; (d) inclusion of a student assistance program with special&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
consideration to be given to girls and minorities; and (e) a component to be included in&#13;
the project aims at supporting dissemination of previous IDA- and UNICEF-supported&#13;
action-oriented research programs that identify innovative approaches to improving&#13;
access to basic education for girls, minorities and poor children.&#13;

2. PROJECT BACKGROUND AND DEVELOPMENT&#13;
A. PROJECT BACKGROUND&#13;
2.1  In proposing the Fourth Basic Education project, the Government has asked IDA&#13;
to support educational programs in nine poor provinces-Guizhou, Hainan, Heilongjiang,&#13;
Hunan, Ningxia, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Sichuan and Yunnan-as it has done in three previous&#13;
projects, EDPP, BEII, and BEIII. This project, and the other three projects combined,&#13;
will cover a total of 364 (61 percent) of the 592 national poor counties designated in the&#13;
Government of China's (GOC) National Plan to Reduce Poverty by the Year 2000. The&#13;
total number of provincially-designated poverty counties, a designation used to denote&#13;
counties not on the national poverty list but with similarly low levels of rural per capita&#13;
income and grain production, covered by all four projects would amount to 90. With&#13;
universal basic education targets having been achieved in the cities and the coastal, more&#13;
economically developed areas, the need to accelerate the effort in rural, poor and minority&#13;
areas is now being addressed. The proposed project is part of this effort, by providing&#13;
cost-effective support to assuring universal access to quality primary education and&#13;
increasing the coverage of junior secondary education in 95 national poverty counties and&#13;
22 provincial poor counties. (See Annex 3 for more details on the coverage of poverty&#13;
counties.)&#13;
2.2   The project will contribute to the Government's poverty reduction efforts by&#13;
improving the income earning potential of more than 6.2 million children in some of the&#13;
poorer counties in China. The project will have a direct impact on approximately 29,160&#13;
schools and will provide varying lengths of training for approximately 138,000 teachers&#13;
and education managers. The project design has taken cognizance of a rich array of&#13;
information sources. These include: the cumulative experiences of SEdC, IDA and&#13;
provincial teams involved in the preparation of previous basic education and other&#13;
education projects; local and international scholarship, research and experience&#13;
particularly in the areas of poverty reduction and human capital development, and the&#13;
education of disadvantaged groups including girls and minorities; the experiences of UN&#13;
agencies such as UNDP, UNESCO and UNICEF and working closely, including&#13;
participation in missions, with some of their Beijing-based staff; economic and financial&#13;
analyses for BEIII and for the current project including HES surveys; and minority&#13;
participation through structured interviews by SEdC teams based on IDA-developed&#13;
instruments used in BEIII, involvement of national and provincial education experts from&#13;
minority nationalities in project design and preparation, and county-level project design&#13;
discussions carried out by both IDA preparation teams and provincial education staff.&#13;
&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;

B. PROJECT DESIGN&#13;
2.3   Project Design.  The project is designed with two programs, the National&#13;
Program (NP) which includes 91 counties in the provinces of Guizhou, Hainan,&#13;
Heilongjiang, Hunan, Shanxi and Yunnan and the Qinba Village Primary Education&#13;
Program (QVPEP) which includes 26 counties in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Ningxia. The&#13;
QVPEP, originally part of the multisectoral Qinba Mountains Poverty Reduction Project&#13;
(QMPRP), to be presented to the Board in June 1997, has been included in BEIV at the&#13;
request of the GOC. The GOC indicated that in their experience multisectoral projects&#13;
have been more efficiently implemented when sectoral ministries assumed primary&#13;
responsibility for project design, preparation and implementation. Thus, the Ministry of&#13;
Finance (MOF) requested the SEdC and the provincial education commissions of&#13;
Sichuan, Ningxia and Shaanxi to take responsibility for the design, preparation and&#13;
implementation of the QVPEP.&#13;
2.4   The QVPEP will be administered by the provincial education commissions with&#13;
central guidance and support from the SEdC. The QVPEP will be implemented in the&#13;
same counties and townships as the QMPRP, thus supporting the QMPRP's multisectoral&#13;
approach to poverty reduction. The goals of the QVPEP program are similar to those of&#13;
the National Program and many of the financing, implementation, monitoring modalities&#13;
will be the same, and therefore there is merit in combining this program with the other six&#13;
provinces of the National Program to become an integral part of BEIV.&#13;
2.5   The key educational issues to be addressed by the project were identified through&#13;
studies carried out jointly by the Association and members of the Chinese education&#13;
research community as well as from the three previous education projects. Likewise,&#13;
identification of the key poverty intervention issues to be addressed in the project resulted&#13;
from studies carried out jointly by the Association and Chinese social scientists. These&#13;
studies were discussed with SEdC. Priorities for project focus were determined in the&#13;
course of project identification and preparation.  Special attention was given to&#13;
procedures for selecting project provinces and, more importantly, counties (including&#13;
those with substantial minority populations). Emphasis was also placed on the design of&#13;
appropriate training and management development programs, formulation of national&#13;
seminars and setting up a system to carry out the innovation programs provided for under&#13;
the project. All of these topics were discussed and settled upon jointly by the Association&#13;
and Government staff during project preparation and appraisal.&#13;
2.6   The project has been designed to further develop the borrower's capacity to&#13;
prepare, implement, monitor and evaluate education projects in the future, whether&#13;
supported with government funding and special categorical grants (see paras. 1.6-1.12 for&#13;
details), or donor agency financing. Building on the prior projects, IDA and SEdC&#13;
prepared nine subprojects, one for each province.  The project will support the&#13;
government's efforts to make primary education universal by the year 2000, with a&#13;
special focus on disadvantaged groups including poor children in remote villages,&#13;
minority groups, and girls. The proportion of minority groups in project counties ranges&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 16-&#13;
from 17 percent to 50 percent in five of the project provinces, with Hunan 17 percent,&#13;
Hainan 31 percent, Ningxia 34 percent, Yunnan 36 percent and Guizhou 50 percent.5&#13;
2.7   This project will continue to emphasize the education objectives of access, equity,&#13;
quality and education management improvement, building on a program of activities&#13;
which characterize Bank-supported basic education projects in poverty areas in China.&#13;
Common to both the National Program and the QVPEP are the construction and repair of&#13;
school buildings, supply of equipment, furniture and books, training of teachers,&#13;
principals, education managers and project implementation staff, with the NP targeting&#13;
primary and junior secondary levels and the QVPEP the primary. Both programs include&#13;
the development of a student assistance facility but this has added emphasis in the&#13;
QVPEP. Pilot sub-components such as the Teacher Services Network, a Textbook Rental&#13;
Scheme in Shanxi Province, and the dissemination of successful practice in girls' and&#13;
minority education will be included in the NP.&#13;
2.8   Strategies responding to the remote locations of the project areas include the&#13;
building of single classroom schools in sparsely-populated locations and the support of&#13;
multigrade approaches to school organization, teaching, curriculum and development of&#13;
materials. Low enrollment, drop-out and completion rates will be addressed by&#13;
supporting the upgrading of teaching qualifications and training of principals as well as&#13;
targeted student assistance initiatives. In order to improve participation and retention&#13;
rates of girls, the project will continue with measures found to be successful in earlier&#13;
Bank and other donor agency projects. Such measures include house-to-house visits by&#13;
school or village committee officials, awareness campaigns, and guidance and counseling&#13;
for families. To respond to the needs of minority populations in the NP (the Hui minority&#13;
in the QVPEP do not use a separate language), the project will improve and expand&#13;
bilingual teaching, and finance the development, printing and distribution of minority&#13;
textbooks.&#13;
2.9   Two UN agencies based in the field, namely, UNDP and UNICEF, have&#13;
contributed to project preparation in areas where they have had significant experiences in&#13;
China (such as education for girls and minority groups). Cooperative work was&#13;
coordinated by SEdC who will continue to oversee collaboration during implementation.&#13;
This is consistent with recommendations from the External Advisory Board on Education&#13;
(March 1996) to work in partnership with agencies which have common objectives in&#13;
client countries, while providing Bank's counterparts in China the opportunity to&#13;
strengthen their capacity in coordinating development inputs from various agencies.&#13;
2.10  Equally consistent with current Bank strategy in project development is the effort&#13;
to pilot innovative components.6 These include continued attempts to establish an&#13;
5 Minority populations of numerical significance in project provinces includes the following: Guizhou:&#13;
Biyi, Dong, Gelao, Lisu, Miao, Yao, Yi; Heilongjiang: Meng; Hainan: Li; Hunan: Dong, Tujia;&#13;
Ningxia: Hui; Yunnan: Bai, Dai, Miao, Yao, Yi.&#13;

&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
expanded and sustainable student assistance mechanism which was started in BEIII; a&#13;
Textbook Rental Scheme in Shanxi Province to reduce education expenditure costs for&#13;
poor households; a renewal of selected elements in the junior secondary teacher training&#13;
curriculum in Yunnan Province; and a Teacher Services Network (TSN) designed to&#13;
support rural village school teachers with the aim of reducing their professional isolation.&#13;
A subpilot in the TSN is a collaborative venture between the Bank's Asia Alternative&#13;
Energy Unit and the Center for Renewable Energy Development of the State Planning&#13;
Commission, overseen by SEdC. This activity aims to demonstrate the value of solar&#13;
photovoltaic systems in providing access to communications, distance learning, and&#13;
lighting services for teachers and students in unelectrified areas in two counties. Data&#13;
from the pilot will enable the SEdC to estimate its potential applicability in educational&#13;
programs across China (see project files for details of the subpilot).&#13;
2.11   National Program. In the NP, the total population of the 91 project counties is&#13;
about 30 million, of which 7.8 million are considered poor by the Chinese Government.&#13;
(See IBRD Map No. 27816.) This is approximately 2.3 percent of the number of people&#13;
the World Bank estimates remain in poverty in China or 13.3 percent of the number&#13;
estimated by the Government.' Minorities constitute approximately 19 percent of the&#13;
population served by the project, accounting for about 20 percent of the minority&#13;
population in the six provinces. The primary and junior secondary schools in project&#13;
counties include about 4.7 million students.&#13;
2.12   Provincial Selection and Targeting Strategy.  Selection of NP-supported&#13;
provinces and counties has been carried out within the government's poverty reduction&#13;
and compulsory education strategies and the Bank's own poverty alleviation guidelines&#13;
laid out in the CAS. The NP provinces (Guizhou, Hainan, Heilongjiang, Hunan, Shanxi,&#13;
and Yunnan) are on the SEdC's priority list for universalization of basic education.&#13;
(Other provinces on this priority list were included in the first three basic education&#13;
projects, EDPP, BEII and BEIII.) Program-supported counties are either national level&#13;
poverty counties on the National 8/7 Poverty Reduction list published in 1994 as part of&#13;
the GOC's National 8/7 Plan to Reduce Poverty by the Year 2000, or provincial poverty&#13;
counties.&#13;
2.13   There is a small number of counties in the proposed project which were included&#13;
in earlier basic education projects. The reason for this is twofold: (a) targeting of&#13;
investments in earlier projects focused more on township complete primary schools rather&#13;
than the village schools which predominate in BEIV, and (b) limited financial resources&#13;
meant that from the start it was not expected that the earlier projects would cover all&#13;

Bank, Report No. 12205, July 1993.&#13;
7 The number of Chinese absolute poor depends on the poverty line used. Using the national definition&#13;
of poverty results in a range between 65 to 100 million poor, whereas the number jumps to 350 million&#13;
if international norms of minimum acceptable living standards are used. See Poverty in China: What&#13;
do the Numbers Say?, World Bank background note, June 1996.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-18-&#13;
needy schools in a particular county. Problems still exist in the education programs for&#13;
these counties and therefore the Government has asked IDA to return to them with&#13;
additional attention and financing. The proposed project will also include a small number&#13;
of these provincial poverty counties in provinces where there are no additional national&#13;
poverty counties in which IDA supported investments in education need to be made at&#13;
this time.&#13;
2.14 Allocation Formula for Project Funds. Allocation of IDA funds among the NP&#13;
provinces was based on a formula (see Annex.A) which gives priority to the number of&#13;
poor counties (both national and provincial) within a province and the population of these&#13;
counties. A sixteen-point weighted scale (see project files for weighted scale) developed&#13;
and used in the Basic Education II and III projects were used in making proposed&#13;
allocation of IDA funds within provinces themselves. This scale takes into account such&#13;
items as the area of dangerous classrooms, percentages of unqualified teachers and&#13;
percentage of female enrollments. This allocation formula will be used for the initial&#13;
draft project financing plans, and may be modified as the project preparation process&#13;
continues.&#13;
2.15  Sub-County Focus. As the primary focus of the project is to build up education&#13;
capacity in poor areas of China's national poverty counties, an important consideration is&#13;
the targeting of project investments at levels within counties where the greatest poverty&#13;
exists. Earlier Bank Group sector work indicated that this is generally at the town and&#13;
village levels outside the county center. Therefore, project investments will, for the most&#13;
part, be made at the town and village and not the county, city or municipality levels.&#13;
Project investments and training will be focused at the subcounty level.&#13;
2.16 Impact on Nonproject Counties. Because the need for increased educational&#13;
inputs manifestly exists in poor counties not covered by the project, the provincial&#13;
governments of the six National Program provinces have provided financing and action&#13;
plans for educational inputs to national poverty counties not supported by the project.&#13;
(See Annex 5 for the levels of committed provincial funding for nonproject counties and&#13;
Annex 6 for nonproject county indicators.) At negotiations assurances were obtained&#13;
that these Project provinces will: (a) implement acceptable programs for nonproject&#13;
counties designed to ensure the continued achievement of acceptable educational targets&#13;
in these counties during the implementation of the project; (b) monitor these programs on&#13;
the basis of indicators acceptable to the Association; and (c) prepare and furnish to the&#13;
Borrower for forwarding to IDA at project Mid-Term a report on this monitoring.&#13;
2.17 In this fashion the IDA credit inputs, coupled with the provinces' own financing&#13;
for nonproject supported counties, will provide a broader program approach to strengthen&#13;
basic education in all of a province's poor counties. This approach will also increase the&#13;
institutional capacity of the SEdC and other provinces to prepare further poverty-focused&#13;
basic education projects.&#13;
&#13;

2.18 Qinba Village Primary Education Program. The QVPEP will take place in 26&#13;
mountainous and remote poor counties of Sichuan (12 counties), Shaanxi (10 counties)&#13;
and Ningxia (4 counties), all of which are nationally designated poor counties under the&#13;
8-7 Plan and are also on SEdC's priority list for universation of basic education (para.&#13;
1.7). The project area comprises two distinct physiographic regions: twenty-two counties&#13;
in northeast Sichuan and southern Shaanxi, stretching along the Qinling and Dabashan&#13;
Mountains; and four counties in southwestern Ningxia in the Loess Plateau. Project&#13;
locations and area information are given in IBRD Map No. 27815. Within the 26 project&#13;
counties, the project area comprises the poorest 2941 administrative villages (or about a&#13;
quarter of the total number of administrative villages in the project counties) with a total&#13;
rural population of 2.3 million people. The Sichuan and Shaanxi project area has&#13;
2.08 million beneficiaries, of which less than one percent are ethnic minorities. The&#13;
Ningxia project area has about 0.24 million people, nearly 80 percent of whom are Hui&#13;
ethnic minority people. The Hui comprise seven percent of the total number of project&#13;
beneficiaries.&#13;
2.19 Counties. About 6 million, or more than one-tenth, of China's remaining&#13;
absolute poor reside in the remote Qinba mountains region of Sichuan and Shaanxi and&#13;
loess hills of Ningxia. The 26 project counties are among the poorest of the 8-7 Plan&#13;
counties, with 1995 average rural per capita income levels ranging between Y 586 to 634,&#13;
and per capita grain production ranging between 206 kg to 365 kg in that year. Poverty&#13;
incidence, income levels and grain production for the project counties and townships, the&#13;
three project provinces, and China are shown in Table 2.1. These data show that between&#13;
one-third to three-quarters of the rural population of the project counties are absolutely&#13;
poor. This level of poverty is six to ten times greater than the incidence of rural poverty&#13;
at the national level, and several times greater than the respective provincial incidences.&#13;
Average rural per capita income and grain production in the project counties are also&#13;
substantially less than the provincial and national averages.&#13;

2.20   The 26 QVPEP counties, although among the poorest in the three project&#13;
provinces, account for less than 10 percent of the number of total counties (a total of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
294). The number of counties was limited in order to make the maximum possible&#13;
impact on the education needs in the target counties, and therefore, the percentage of&#13;
provincial coverage provided by the QVPEP is about one half the geographical coverage&#13;
provided under the National Program. Since there is such a large number of nonproject&#13;
counties in each province (e.g., the ratio of project to nonproject counties in Sichuan is&#13;
12:174) and the relatively small percentage of project funds, (which represents less than 1&#13;
percent of the total provincial education budgets), it was confirmed that the project would&#13;
not be able to monitor the nonproject county education programs.&#13;
2.21 Townships and Villages. The exclusion of about two thirds of the townships in&#13;
the project counties allows for the targeting of adequate investments to the very poorest&#13;
villages. The incidence of poverty in the project townships ranges between 75 percent in&#13;
Shaanxi to 88 percent in Ningxia, or between nine to twelve times greater than the&#13;
national average rate.&#13;
2.22  Selection Process. To target meaningful levels of educational assistance to the&#13;
very poorest households in the project area, the QVPEP Program could include only a&#13;
limited number of project counties and a subset of townships and administrative villages&#13;
within those counties. The principal criteria for the selection of project townships and&#13;
administrative villages were below average per capita income levels and grain&#13;
production. As illustrated in the IBRD Map No. 27815, an effort was also made to select&#13;
townships and administrative villages in continuous project area blocks in order to&#13;
improve ease of project implementation.&#13;
2.23  The 26 counties covered by the QVPEP represent areas of absolute poverty&#13;
covered in Category 3 and 4 of the Government's 1994 "Outline for Reform and&#13;
Development of Education in China" (see para. 1.6-1.12). In these areas the national&#13;
education goals for the year 2000 call for universalization of three to four years of&#13;
primary education with junior secondary goals to be achieved somewhat later in the new&#13;
century. However, as project design for the QVPEP portion of the project stresses&#13;
developing higher levels of numeracy and literacy, skill levels seen as necessary to escape&#13;
poverty, the 26 counties in the QVPEP portion of the project seek to increase enrollments&#13;
so that a full six years of schooling will be provided. In order to achieve the five or six&#13;
years of schooling the QVPEP has incorporated a more robust student assistance program&#13;
than the National Program. The aim of this student assistance program is to ensure that&#13;
children in these very poor project areas will not be deprived of schooling for financial&#13;
reasons. Estimates differ as to the total number of school age children in QVPEP who are&#13;
out of school, but based on 1990 census statistics the most reasonable estimate is that of&#13;
the 321,000 school aged children in the project, 15 percent or 48,000 are not enrolled, and&#13;
for those not enrolled, approximately 34,000 are not in school for poverty reasons. (The&#13;
provincial authorities calculate that approximately 70 percent of children not enrolled are&#13;
out of school for economic/poverty reasons. Using a unit cost of Y 50/year for student&#13;
support, an estimated $3.0 million over the life of the projects will be necessary to both&#13;
keep those children in school who would drop out because of economics reason and bring&#13;
those children into school who are not now enrolled for economic reasons.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

C. PROJECT PREPARATION AND PARTICIPATION&#13;
2.24 Borrower Involvement in Project Preparation. Based on experience with the&#13;
previous projects, SEdC organized three working groups used by both the National&#13;
Program and the QVPEP which were instrumental in preparation and will be used in&#13;
project implementation. These groups are: (a) a Project Working Group, comprising&#13;
working level staff from SEdC's Departments of Finance, Foreign Investment and Loan&#13;
Office (FILO), Minority Education, Basic Education, Equipment, Teacher Training and&#13;
Supervision, which has been responsible for organizing all project preparatory activities;&#13;
(b) the Project Leading Group, comprising the directors of departments represented in the&#13;
first group and responsible for providing guidance and coordination and resolving major&#13;
implementation issues that may arise; and (c) the Project Expert Consultative Group,&#13;
comprising 7-9 non-SEdC experts specializing in basic education, minority/bilingual&#13;
education, teacher training, curriculum development, civil works, equipment and&#13;
education management, which advised and made suggestions on project preparation.&#13;
2.25  Local Participation in NP Project Preparation and Design. Participatory&#13;
methods have been followed in the design of the project components. The SEdC's initial&#13;
organization meeting in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, sought and received provincial level&#13;
stakeholder commitment to the project concept and, based on this agreement, the&#13;
provinces provided their first set of project proposals which were reviewed by the&#13;
May, 1996, mission. The provinces themselves, in their preparation of the proposals,&#13;
took county realities and priorities into consideration which is evidenced by varying&#13;
investment priorities requested by county and township authorities. Village committees&#13;
and school principals discussed project design issues. These issues were primarily&#13;
priorities in proposed project investment at the school level, provision of student&#13;
assistance to poor children and participation in the development of local content for the&#13;
curriculum with provincial, national and Bank preparation teams. (It was a headmaster in&#13;
Hunan who told the mission about his experience in textbook rental schemes that led to&#13;
the mission's consideration of the feature.) Provinces and counties have the flexibility to&#13;
exclude or modify characteristics of project components based on their own needs&#13;
assessment exercises.&#13;
2.26 Local Participation in QVPEP Project Preparation. To ensure that the&#13;
QVPEP targeted the population group a household survey was conducted. The survey&#13;
sample consisted of four counties in each of the three QVPEP project provinces and&#13;
approximately 30 percent of the counties households. Using data from the survey, the&#13;
sample counties, along with the other project counties, established criteria for selecting&#13;
project townships and natural villages that would participate in the project. (See&#13;
para. 2.20-2.23.) The survey results also showed that most parents view education fees&#13;
and expenses as major impediments to their ability to provide an education for their&#13;
children. The comments by the parents lead to the expanded student assistance program&#13;
that has been incorporated into the QVPEP component of this project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
2.27 NP Education for Minorities. As improving education for the minorities is an&#13;
objective of this program, project provinces will pay special attention to increasing&#13;
participation and completion rates of the minorities. This can be achieved by continuing&#13;
with measures that have proved to be successful in the past while reinforcing them with&#13;
new measures. These include campaigns for implementing the Compulsory Education&#13;
Law among the minorities, regular home visits to minority families, and specific social&#13;
support or welfare systems for the minorities, such as the Hope Project and Student&#13;
Assistance Program, etc. To enhance girls' school attendance and retention rates, project&#13;
provinces will provide prevocational, potentially income-generating and skills training&#13;
courses in junior secondary schools and strengthen bilingual education for the non-Han&#13;
speaking minorities to increase their employment opportunities. Project counties with a&#13;
small proportion of minorities include in their teaching curricula a range of minority-&#13;
focused materials including: stories and songs from the local oral tradition; inclusion of&#13;
major points in local minority history in the history courses; dances and skits based on&#13;
local minority culture and contributions of the local minorities to the economic&#13;
development of the area.&#13;
2.28 NP Minority Participation Interviews. During the preparation of BEIII,&#13;
specific efforts were made to solicit input from people in minority areas with a view to&#13;
enhancing project responsiveness to the needs and aspirations of communities. Building&#13;
on this experience and assisted by local researchers, the SEdC organized documented&#13;
structured interviews to involve minority stakeholders in decision-making.  These&#13;
discussions, involving parents, grandparents, teachers and principals, village education&#13;
committee members and local village leaders, focused primarily on the local education&#13;
priorities. In addition to these structured interviews, local county-level education offices,&#13;
using input from village and township education committees, drafted project plans which&#13;
were based on local, including minority, considerations and these plans were used to&#13;
produce the provincial plans which were appraised by IDA. The main findings of BEIII&#13;
and BEIV, which had significant inputs into research design, may be summarized as&#13;
follows:&#13;
*  Only by acquiring literacy and numeracy skills will the children be able to&#13;
escape the poverty of their parents/grandparents; it was worth their while to&#13;
overcome family difficulties to ensure schooling for their children;&#13;
*  "Educational difficulties" are considered to be inadequate or unsafe buildings&#13;
and facilities; books and other teaching/learning materials; and insufficient&#13;
number of teachers with experience in bilingual teaching;&#13;
*  The project should place strong emphasis on eliminating dangerous schools&#13;
and providing good new classrooms which will attract children and qualified&#13;
teachers;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
*  It was important that teachers and principals received further training to&#13;
provide quality education for their children and that teachers possess bilingual&#13;
education skills;&#13;
*  Basic education in rural poor areas is primarily to acquire skills necessary to&#13;
contribute to the local economy and secondarily to provide an educational&#13;
foundation for higher education;&#13;
*  Mastery of the national language is essential in preparing school-leavers to&#13;
move from poverty areas, even within a province, to where the jobs are;&#13;
*  Initial instruction in the mother language is important to retain awareness of&#13;
minority culture and to be able to communicate with family members;&#13;
2.29  Of lesser importance but still necessary is the provision of school furniture and&#13;
teaching equipment. It is important for the curriculum to include stories of local model&#13;
citizens and the history and stories of the local culture; some thought local culture alone&#13;
would spoil the chances of their children in province-wide or nation-wide competition so&#13;
both school curricular content should have a balance of both. Work initiated by the SEdC&#13;
in BEII and BEIII on the development of locally relevant curriculum materials will&#13;
continue in BEIV with local communities and Village Education Committees (composed&#13;
of grandparents, parents and village leaders including, in minority areas, minority&#13;
representation) providing the lead and indicating local area needs. Education of girls is&#13;
important so that they can learn life skills which enable them to contribute to the local&#13;
economy. Parents, especially mothers, were of the opinion that the isolation of schools&#13;
and having to stay in boarding schools discouraged school retention and completion&#13;
particularly for girls.&#13;
2.30 Household Education Spending Survey of NP Provinces. In addition, and&#13;
following and refining the successful piloting of such efforts in BEIII, the preparation&#13;
team surveyed household attitudes toward the project design in four sample counties&#13;
through household interviews and gathering of household data on education spending.&#13;
These discussions primarily focused on priorities in proposed project investment at the&#13;
school level, provision of student assistance to poor children and special needs in the&#13;
development of local content for curriculum. In the four counties surveyed in Shanxi and&#13;
Yunnan Provinces, education spending was a heavy economic burden for a significant&#13;
proportion of households. For 22-40 percent of the households, HES accounted for at&#13;
least 20 percent of total household spending and for 22-31 percent of the households,&#13;
HES accounted for at least 20 percent of household net income. HES per child increased&#13;
sharply with the level of schooling (although this varied substantially across the four&#13;
counties): in 1995 HES averaged Y 190 for primary education and 482 for junior&#13;
secondary education.  The household survey has lead to an innovative project&#13;
component-a pilot textbook rental scheme. (See para. 3.14 and Annex 7 for details on&#13;
the textbook rental scheme.)&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
2.31   This combination of interview and survey procedures gave a balanced perspective&#13;
on the issues such as the adequacy of local content in the curriculum, the use of the&#13;
mother tongue as the language of instruction, and their level of support for the proposed&#13;
Textbook Rental Scheme. Supervision missions in earlier Bank-supported education&#13;
projects have shown that there is substantial variation in how each county in a project has&#13;
actually designed their county-level projects, which is responsive to local educational&#13;
needs and economic realities. The supervision missions have found that this variation in&#13;
county-level design seems to be closely linked to the stated desires of village level&#13;
education committees and the balance that the township level education offices bring to&#13;
the priority selection process. Participation is good and local commitment is high.&#13;
Project components have been and will continue to be designed around local as well as&#13;
national goals and targets, especially in minority areas.&#13;
2.32  Taking the findings of the economic and financial analysis, the results of the&#13;
household surveys, the minority participation interviews and the previous design&#13;
experience from Basic Education II and III into account, the proposed project design will&#13;
include: (a) increased bilingual teacher training; (b) purchase of minority language&#13;
supplementary and library reading materials, where appropriate; (c) development of local&#13;
content for curricula; (d) identification and training of minority-especially female&#13;
minority-headteachers or principals; (e) research at the normal school level in effective&#13;
teaching methods (both culturally and linguistically) to be used in minority areas;&#13;
(f) active village committee participation in village school activities especially in the&#13;
local content portion of the curriculum; (g) special consideration be given to minorities in&#13;
setting criteria for the student assistance programs and ensuring that actual funds will be&#13;
monitored; (h) all elements of minority participation at village education committee level&#13;
will be monitored on an on-going basis by the CEP, which will modify activities as&#13;
appropriate at Mid-Term; write a final report at project completion; and monitoring&#13;
arrangements will be included in final negotiation documents.&#13;

3. THE PROJECT&#13;
A. PROJECT OBJECTIVES&#13;
3.1   To address the sector issues discussed in para. 1.5, the project aims to:&#13;
(a)   Increase access/equity for the absolute poor in primary and junior&#13;
secondary education in poor and minority areas to achieve universal&#13;
primary education and the expansion of junior secondary education, with&#13;
particular attention to girls and minority nationalities;&#13;
(b)   Enhance quality in primary and junior secondary schooling, and the&#13;
corresponding teacher education and training of trainers' programs; and&#13;
(c)   Improve efficiency in the delivery of education through improving&#13;
educational management at national, provincial, county and project&#13;
institutional levels.&#13;
3.2   These proposed project objectives are consistent with GOC's goal of achieving&#13;
NYCE by the year 2000. They are also consistent with the World Bank's policy goals of&#13;
supporting poverty reduction in China by improving basic education in poor and minority&#13;
areas, and of casting project activities within the framework of the GOC's National Plan&#13;
to Reduce Poverty by the Year 2000.&#13;
3.3   Key Project Monitoring and Development Impact Indicators. For the Bank to&#13;
monitor and evaluate overall performance and development impact in both programs of&#13;
the project in relation to the project objectives of access/equity, quality and efficiency,&#13;
key performance and impact indicators have been developed jointly by IDA and SEdC&#13;
(Annex 8 provides targets to be achieved by each of the nine provinces) on the basis of&#13;
experience in the three earlier basic education projects. They will use data from the&#13;
performance indicators provided by project provinces as well as other information&#13;
provided by SEdC and the PEdCs, particularly data disaggregated by gender and minority&#13;
nationality. The nine indicators are: Access/Equity: (i) student enrollment, (ii) number of&#13;
students receiving financial assistance; Quality: (iii) proportion of qualified teachers at&#13;
primary and junior secondary levels and at normal levels, and (iv) proportion of qualified&#13;
bilingual teachers in primary schools in counties, (v) lab opening hours per week for&#13;
normal schools; Efficiency: (vi) student completion rates for primary and junior&#13;
secondary schools, (vii) transition rates from primary to junior secondary, (viii) dropout&#13;
rates for primary and junior secondary, (ix) student learning achievement indicators in&#13;
language and mathematics for primary and junior secondary schools with the addition of&#13;
physics for the latter.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-26 -&#13;
B. PROJECT DESCRIPTION-NATIONAL PROGRAM (NP)&#13;
3.4   To achieve improved access/equity, the project will pOovide for civil works&#13;
construction, equipment, furniture, books and other instructional materials to primary and&#13;
junior secondary schools in poor, minority and remote areas. To enhance quality,&#13;
teachers and principals will be provided training to upgrade professional content and&#13;
practical skills. Equipment and staff training will be provided to a small number of&#13;
normal schools which train primary school teachers and which serve poor and minority&#13;
areas as well as a small proportion of trainers in normal colleges which train junior&#13;
secondary school teachers. To improve education management, the project will provide&#13;
training for educational managers and for the development and utilization of educational&#13;
management information services. About 90 percent of IDA Credit for the National&#13;
Program will be allocated to primary and junior secondary education, 7 percent to Normal&#13;
Schools and about 3 percent for management. Of the allocation for primary and&#13;
secondary schooling, proportions will reflect individual provincial situations with not less&#13;
than 54 percent for primary and not more than 46 percent for junior secondary education.&#13;
3.5   Utilizing allocated Credit proceeds, each participating province will implement&#13;
Education Programs comprising activities from the three project components which are&#13;
described below.&#13;
Access To Nine Year Compulsory Education Component (NYCE) (Base Cost $93.23&#13;
million)&#13;
3.6   The project would support the Borrower's efforts to: (a) provide approximately&#13;
380,000 additional places during the project period and improve the highly inadequate&#13;
existing facilities (in about 5 percent of schools) in primary and junior secondary schools&#13;
through civil works; (b) provide existing and new schools with equipment and furniture;&#13;
(c) help poor students gain access to basic education through the Student Assistance&#13;
Program which will help to expand existing scholarship programs; and (d) reduce the cost&#13;
of textbooks to parents and help to remove a barrier in access to basic education by&#13;
piloting a Textbook Rental Scheme in Shanxi Province.&#13;
3.7   Civil Works (Base cost $66.62 million). The project would finance civil works&#13;
for primary and junior secondary schools in 91 project counties according to SEdC and/or&#13;
Provincial space planning and construction guidelines. The scope of works in primary&#13;
and junior schools would include: (a) repairs to existing structures which are in poor&#13;
physical condition with an estimated cost of Y 38.5 million for some 293,400 m2;&#13;
(b) replacement of unsafe, dangerous structures (identified by communities as a high&#13;
priority) with an estimated cost of Y 113.7 million for some 242,400 M2; and&#13;
(c) construction of new schools in underserved counties on existing property for which no&#13;
new land acquisition will be required and expansion of existing schools through&#13;
additional classrooms, libraries, laboratories, and dormitories. The new construction of&#13;
some 889,700 m2 is estimated to cost Y 386 million (Annex9). Planning (including&#13;
training) for civil works is at an advanced stage of preparation for construction scheduled&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
to start in early 1997 through retroactive financing from the project. By 2002, the project&#13;
is expected to provide 243,000 new places at the primary level and 135,000 at the junior&#13;
secondary level, amounting to a total of 378,000.&#13;
3.8   Architectural and engineering designwork for building construction and repair has&#13;
been undertaken which are cost-effective and satisfactory to the Association. The&#13;
requirements of buildings in areas prone to earthquake and floods have been taken into&#13;
account in the engineering plans. Construction will be handled by county construction&#13;
bureaus or companies with the support of the provincial construction departments or -&#13;
where capabilities at the county level are inadequate - entirely by the latter.&#13;
3.9   Unit costs for civil works will reflect local variations, particularly in areas which&#13;
are prone to earthquakes and floods. Implementation of civil works will be phased over&#13;
five years with priority given to the replacement of dangerous structures. Building&#13;
construction will be phased so as to integrate with such essentially related activities as the&#13;
procurement of equipment, furniture and books, and staff training. School maintenance&#13;
plans will be prepared annually for project-supported schools. During negotiations,&#13;
provinces provided acceptable maintenance plans including funding levels; for the&#13;
duration of the project.&#13;
3.10  Equipment and Furniture (Base Cost $25.60 million).   The learning&#13;
environment in the primary and junior secondary schools of counties-supported by both&#13;
parts of the project-would be improved through the provision of equipment and&#13;
fiurniture.   These provisions, based on the SEdC  guidelines, would include:&#13;
(a) equipment for some 10,178 schools estimated to cost Y 122.5 million; and (b) some&#13;
668,000 sets of furniture with costs estimated at Y 34 million (Annex 1Q). Marked&#13;
discrepancies exist between instructional equipment available in more affluent areas and&#13;
that in poor, rural counties. This disparity is reflected in classrooms where the absence of&#13;
basic instructional aids such as maps, wall charts, measuring devices and even the simple&#13;
scientific equipment required by the junior secondary school curriculum results in&#13;
teaching methodologies based on didactic, rote-memory approaches.&#13;
3.11   SEdC classifies equipment needs according to "Standard Levels" which are based&#13;
on school size, hierarchy (e.g., central school) and teacher training responsibility;&#13;
conducts periodic surveys to assess current levels and new procurement needs; and&#13;
together with PEdCs and County Education Bureaus has, for this project, identified&#13;
specific requirements for project-supported schools. Equipment lists have been prepared&#13;
and reviewed, using criteria acceptable to the Association. Approved programs will&#13;
provide inservice training for equipment utilization.&#13;
3.12  Student Assistance. To reduce the burden on poor families, a student assistance&#13;
program will be piloted in all of the project counties much along the lines established&#13;
under the BEIII project. Approximately I to 5 percent of the project's counterpart funds&#13;
will be allocated to this subcomponent. HES surveys and discussions with minority&#13;
groups identified schooling costs as a serious obstacle to school enrollment. The&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
counterpart funds for this subcomponent will be put into a student assistance fund and the&#13;
interest proceeds from the fund will be used to provide assistance to approximately&#13;
46,000 children at primary and junior secondary levels. Pupils will not receive cash&#13;
payments. Depending on need, they will receive varying amounts of reductions and&#13;
waivers in payments for textbooks, miscellaneous fees, and other schooling-related costs.&#13;
Working within the framework set up by SEdC, the project provinces will develop their&#13;
own criteria for: (a) eligibility for assistance and selection criteria; (b) targeting and&#13;
assistance (in particular for female and minority students); (c) financing of the fund; and&#13;
(d) management and monitoring of the program. Assisted by the CEP, SEdC and&#13;
provinces will jointly monitor and evaluate the program.&#13;
3.13  These efforts show the recognition of student assistance as an effective measure in&#13;
increasing enrollment rates and reducing poor families' financial burden. However, in&#13;
spite of strong national and provincial support for the scheme, funds are currently&#13;
insufficient to filly cover the needs. Project provinces have developed a program plan&#13;
for the years 1997-2002 to indicate coverage of students and financing sources for the&#13;
fund. Each National Program Province must establish student assistance programs with&#13;
full initial deposits by September 1, 1998, after providing IDA with theit program&#13;
information and their deposits by August 1, 1998.&#13;
3.14 Pilot Textbook Rental Scheme. The HES Survey has shown that the economic&#13;
burden of education is an important contributing factor to parents' decision not to send&#13;
their children to school. To reduce the private cost of education in poor families, the&#13;
project will pilot a textbook rental scheme (see Annex 7 for detailed guidelines) in Shanxi&#13;
Province aimed at reducing the cost of textbooks, with the objectives of improving access&#13;
to education, improving efficiency in the utilization of scarce education resources, and&#13;
promoting students' discipline and care for books. In the pilot activity, parents will pay&#13;
the full cost (approximately Y 70) of a set of textbooks at the beginning of the school&#13;
year. At the end of the school year, parents may return the books for a partial refund or&#13;
credit for purchasing the following year's textbooks. The amount of refund or credit will&#13;
depend on the condition of the returned still usable textbooks. The scheme would involve&#13;
the first six grades in 4 village primary schools in two counties in Shanxi Province. The&#13;
investment will be largely for protective plastic book covers; bookshelves; training; and&#13;
materials for managing activities and documenting of records. The activity will be&#13;
managed by the Shanxi PEdC assisted by researchers from the Higher Education Institute&#13;
of Taiyuan Industrial University. A project implementation group, comprising school&#13;
principals and instructional staff including project class teachers, will be set up. An&#13;
interim evaluative report on lessons learned will be reported and shared with project&#13;
provinces during the Mid-Term Review.&#13;
Education Quality Enhancement Component (Base Cost $13.39 million)&#13;
3.15  The project would focus on the key factors which influence educational quality,&#13;
instructional materials and teachers. It would thus: (a) provide books and supplementary&#13;
materials including materials in minority languages; (b) provide inservice training to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
trainers, principals, underqualified teachers and training in specialty areas such as&#13;
multigrade teaching and bilingual education; (c) improve classroom teaching-learning&#13;
processes through an innovative Teacher Services Network; (d) strengthen the capacity of&#13;
Normal Schools to modernize primary level teacher training programs; and (e) support&#13;
dissemination activities aimed at systematic analysis, documentation, and application of&#13;
innovative strategies in the areas of education for girls and minorities.&#13;
3.16 Books and Supplementary Materials. Some 14 million copies of books for&#13;
libraries estimated to cost Y 37 million will be provided. For primary schools, the&#13;
number of books per child will increase from 3 in 1995 to between 5 and 6 in 2002. For&#13;
junior secondary schools, the number of books per pupil will double from 5 in 1995 to 10&#13;
in 2002. These will include materials in minority languages for minority pupils,&#13;
reflecting local cultures as appropriate. The training of library teachers would be&#13;
supported to improve the utilization of books as instructional resources as well as&#13;
management and utilization of libraries.&#13;
3.17  Staff Upgrading. An extensive program of staff training, largely through in-&#13;
country programs, will benefit about 65,000 teachers. Staff will follow training programs&#13;
for upgrading academic qualifications, specialty certification, multigrade teaching,&#13;
bilingual teaching, science teaching, laboratory technician training, librarianship,&#13;
continuous education and for improving principals school management skills. (See&#13;
Annex 11.) Training will be carried out through long-term and short-term inservice&#13;
courses which will develop appropriate structures to reach out to the poorest and most&#13;
remote schools. Training programs will focus both on upgrading content and teaching&#13;
methodology, focusing particularly on practical classroom skills appropriate for rural&#13;
schools in sparsely populated areas such as multigrade teaching techniques. In minority&#13;
areas, attention will be given to provision of training in bilingual education. All&#13;
programs are part of the provincial training programs which are in place. Terms of&#13;
Reference (TORs) for project-related training programs have been reviewed by the&#13;
Association and found acceptable.&#13;
3.18  At the junior secondary level, the project will support an innovative teacher&#13;
training program in science teaching, focusing on the training of trainers mechanism.&#13;
The focus of training programs will be new approaches to science teaching which&#13;
incorporate better understanding of contemporary and local issues such as environmental&#13;
protection, nutrition, and health care (see Annex 12).&#13;
3.19 Teacher Services Network Pilot (TSN). The objective of the TSN is to develop&#13;
professional consultative services and an enabling work environment which would&#13;
support village level, school-based activities aimed at improving access to a variety of&#13;
pedagogical practices and at responding speedily to rural teachers' problems and&#13;
difficulties (Annex13). With the establishment of TSNs, teachers in village primary&#13;
schools and teaching points will be less professionally isolated, have access to more&#13;
professional reading and instructional material, and have opportunities for more frequent&#13;
peer group interaction. Selected Town Central Primary Schools will become designated&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
"hubs" of the Network. These will be supported with the provision of additional&#13;
professional staff, equipment, reference books and adequate space where TSN materials&#13;
will be accommodated and routine activities carried out. Teachers in minority areas will&#13;
have the opportunity to develop locally-relevant teaching materials and experiment with&#13;
teaching approaches which utilize local human and material resources.&#13;
3.20  The TSN will be piloted in 10 counties8 during the project period, using structures&#13;
and organizational arrangements agreed between PEdCs, participating county education&#13;
bureaus, principals and staff of Central Primary Schools, and teacher representatives from&#13;
village schools and teaching points. Normal School Curriculum Review Groups will&#13;
oversee the professional activities while ensuring that awareness of TSN objectives,&#13;
organization, functions and activities is included in the Normal School final year&#13;
syllabus. Prior to launching the Network, counties will undertake a needs assessment&#13;
survey at village school level in order to identify and prioritize village teachers'&#13;
immediate skill needs. The program for the first year will be designed on the basis of&#13;
survey findings. A designated member of the CEP with teacher training experience will&#13;
assist FILO in monitoring TSN activities and these will be evaluated during the Mid-&#13;
Term Review. Performance monitoring indicators, specific to this activity and agreed&#13;
between the SEdC and PEdCs, are also set out in Annex 13.&#13;
3.21   Normal Schools ($7.63 million). Normal schools train teachers for the nation's&#13;
primary schools through pre-service and in-service programs. The National Program&#13;
portion of the project will finance staff upgrading programs, equipment and book&#13;
purchase (Annexi14). All provincial proposals affirmed the crucial role a qualitatively&#13;
improved normal school training system would play in assisting efforts to achieve NYCE&#13;
and raising teaching quality and school efficiency (Annax15). The policy of graduates&#13;
returming to their home villages will ensure that project benefits will remain in the&#13;
villages. As a direct result of the component, benefits will also accrue to nonproject&#13;
counties since normal schools, which are generally under prefectural jurisdiction, serve&#13;
both project and nonproject counties. The project component, receiving about 7 percent&#13;
of Credit proceeds, would support 46 normal schools which include 12 minority normal&#13;
schools, a primary school teacher training and research center in Hainan and a&#13;
broadcasting normal school in Guizhou. About 40 percent of student enrollment in 1995&#13;
were minorities of which about 43 percent were girls. Two hundred and seventeen&#13;
principals and 3,094 teachers would have completed staff upgrading programs&#13;
(Annex16).&#13;
3.22 Dissemination Program. This sub-component will document, disseminate and&#13;
apply effective and innovative educational experiments and successful experiences in the&#13;
areas of minorities' and girls' education with the aim of overcoming some of the existing&#13;
8 The Bank is also benefiting some twenty schools in the TSN through a parallel, independently-funded&#13;
activity which seeks to demonstrate the use of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems to provide power to&#13;
unelectrified schools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 31 -&#13;
educational problems in projected-supported counties. Activities will include those&#13;
carried out by local, national and international institutions and agencies which have&#13;
worked locally. Examples of these include the success which skills development&#13;
programs have had in some areas in retaining girls at junior secondary level; and the&#13;
success of some bilingual education programs in meeting the aspirations of minority&#13;
parents for their children's school experiences. Draft plans for the program will be drawn&#13;
up by project provinces in consultation with County Education Bureaus and Village&#13;
Committees (on which members of the community and parents are represented) for&#13;
review and approval by the CEP and SEdC. The program will be implemented by the&#13;
schools and township/County Education Bureaus, supervised by the PEdC, CEP, SEdC&#13;
and IDA supervision missions. The CEP will provide advice on the dissemination&#13;
programs, and assist FILO in monitoring their progress and reporting on their&#13;
implementation (Annex1).&#13;
Education Management Improvement Component (Base Cost $1.10 million)&#13;
3.23  In order to increase overall efficiency, enlarge the capacity of the administrative&#13;
system to achieve NYCE, and implement and monitor both parts of the proposed project,&#13;
this centrally-managed component (see Annex 18) would include: (a) national-level&#13;
management training for provincial trainers, education managers and administrators, and&#13;
project implementation staff; (b) centrally-organized seminars and workshops in support&#13;
of various project components, including the organization of overseas study tours;&#13;
(c) support for the Chinese Experts Panel which will assist FILO/SEdC in the monitoring&#13;
of the project; and (d) the improvement of management and utilization of EMIS to&#13;
strengthen project implementation and overall education administration.  Training&#13;
programs will be conducted by 48 Chinese experts and four foreign experts.&#13;
3.24 By 2002, the SEdC would have provided national-level project-related training for&#13;
managers. The content and approaches in all programs will address problems prevalent&#13;
in remote, rural, poor, and minority areas. Training of provincial-level staff will be&#13;
provided at the national level. Provinces will provide training for all staff below the&#13;
provincial level. The planning and management capacity of provincial, prefecture,&#13;
counties and township level education offices will be enhanced through extensive&#13;
training, largely in-country, by local experts. Training workshops and seminars will be&#13;
conducted for: (a) staff responsible for project management; (b) educational managers,&#13;
planners and professional personnel; and (c) include seminars designed to address the&#13;
quality enhancement component of the project.&#13;
3.25  Project Management. Project implementation capacity in each participating&#13;
county will be strengthened through training workshops for project management staff in&#13;
modern techniques of project management encompassing planning and execution of civil&#13;
works and procurement of equipment and books; project accounting and disbursement of&#13;
Credit and counterpart funds; and project monitoring and evaluation. Special emphasis&#13;
will be given to financial planning and management and the importance of keeping&#13;
financial accounts in step with project implementation. The training will take into&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 32 -&#13;
consideration provincial experience in the three earlier basic education projects as well as&#13;
other IDA-supported education projects. Each province has established a project steering&#13;
committee and working group to train county staff, and developed an appropriate training&#13;
program including planning of provincial and inter-provincial workshops and the hiring&#13;
of local specialist services.&#13;
3.26 Education Sector Management. Administrators at the provincial level will&#13;
participate in extensive in-country training in education planning and administration, with&#13;
special emphasis on: (a) educational financing and financial and human resource&#13;
mobilization and utilization; and (b) strategies for improving access and equity in&#13;
education, and raising the quality and efficiency of schooling. Special subjects will be&#13;
the Teacher Services Network (TSN) and the Educational Management Information&#13;
(EMIS) to widen the administrators' understanding of their purpose and function as&#13;
facilitators of education sector management. The training is aimed at fostering the&#13;
capacity for developing problem solving skills within the local context and formulating&#13;
policies to promote and sustain education and human resource development. When the&#13;
provincial administrators complete their training, they will, in turn, conduct training&#13;
programs for county, township and village personnel. The programs will include&#13;
workshops on all the subject areas the provincial administrators have learned, and&#13;
specialized training sessions for normal school principals and laboratory directors.&#13;
3.27 Educational Management Information System. The successful implementation&#13;
and operation of an EMIS will help the implementation of both parts of the project and&#13;
provide the logistical support for effective management of the education sector in general,&#13;
and primary and secondary education in particular.  The project will support the&#13;
establishment of EMIS in each project province and county education office for&#13;
management of primary and secondary schools. Where EMIS has been started, as in&#13;
Guizhou, Hunan, Shanxi and Yunnan under the EDPP project, and in Hainan and&#13;
Heilongjiang under the ETS project, this project will reinforce the system with the&#13;
appropriate staff training and/or supplementary equipment. The initial investment will&#13;
include the provision of equipment, software, and staff training. The State Research&#13;
Center of Computer Education for Primary and Secondary Schools under the aegis of the&#13;
SEdC will identify experts to conduct training sessions for approximately 200 designated&#13;
personnel in 1997 and 1998, in time for the component to have some impact during the&#13;
project period (Annex 18).&#13;
3.28 Seminars and Study Tours. A number of seminars and study tours have been&#13;
planned by SEdC to support project activities and project-related training workshops.&#13;
Seminars will include those which provide opportunities for exchanging experiences for&#13;
staff involved in the establishment of the TSN; sessions on girls' education, minorities'&#13;
education, seminars in project fields specially designed for principals of primary and&#13;
junior secondary schools; and quality issues in teacher training. Overseas study tours will&#13;
focus on gaining international perspectives on continuous, post-qualification teacher&#13;
support; educational planning, finance and management; project management; and&#13;
increasing efficiency of schools.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

3.29 Chinese Experts Panel (CEP). A CEP has been established under the aegis of&#13;
the SEdC to provide ongoing guidance and services to SEdC and the provinces on project&#13;
implementation and policy issues (AnnexIl9). The CEP will serve the needs of both the&#13;
National Program and the Qinba Village Primary Education Program. In particular, the&#13;
CEP will assist FILO/SEdC monitor and evaluate the student assistance program&#13;
administered by the provinces, the TSN and Dissemination Program activities; follow up&#13;
and evaluate the pilot Textbook Rental Scheme; monitor the progress of the normal&#13;
school component; and provide professional guidance on all technical assistance&#13;
activities. The participation of some CEP members in pre-appraisal and appraisal bodes&#13;
well for the project as it helps to bring preparation and implementation activities together,&#13;
thereby assuring effective execution of the project.&#13;
C. PROJECT DESCRIPTION-QINBA VILLAGE PRIMARY EDUCATION PROGRAM&#13;
(QVPEP)&#13;
3.30 The QVPEP would facilitate the development of locally funded and managed&#13;
education systems for the absolute poor at the village level in the counties and townships&#13;
which are part of the Qinba Mountain Poverty Reduction Project. The QVPEP would&#13;
address low educational attainment among the poor in the Qinba project areas by&#13;
enhancing the delivery of primary education through: (a) renovation and construction of&#13;
school buildings and facilities, (b) provision of student assistance for poor students,&#13;
(c) provision of textbooks, instructional equipment and furniture, and (d) teacher and&#13;
management training. Due to the disproportionately low levels of female enrollment and&#13;
retention in the project area, the project's target of five or six-year UBE strongly favors&#13;
girls' education. The QVPEP program concentrates investment in village level basic&#13;
infrastructure, upgrading the quality and reliability of services, and the development of&#13;
mechanisms to insure access to educational services by the absolute poor. The QVPEP&#13;
program includes mechanisms to ensure project sustainability and funding for student&#13;
assistance.&#13;
Access to Nine Year Compulsory Education Component (Base Cost $21.03 million)&#13;
3.31 Civil Works (Base Costs $13.81 million). The QVPEP will finance civil works&#13;
for primary schools based on SEdC and/or Provincial space planning and construction&#13;
guidelines. The scope of works for the three QVPEP provinces will include: (a) repairs to&#13;
existing structures which are in poor physical condition with an estimated cost of Y 2.04&#13;
million for some 13,500 m2; (b) replacement of dangerous structures with an estimated&#13;
cost of Y 33.9 million for some 83,900 mi2; and (c) construction of new schools in&#13;
underserved counties on existing property for which no new acquisition will be required&#13;
and expansion of existing schools through additional classrooms, laboratories and&#13;
libraries at an estimated cost of Y 76.9 million for 188,800 mi (Annex 2Q).&#13;
3.32 Equipment, Furniture and Books (Base Costs $4.24 million). The primary&#13;
schools under the QVPEP will have their schools improved through the provision of&#13;
equipment, library books, desks and chairs, and a limited amount of furniture for&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
laboratories. Most schools will use project funds to purchase "3rd class equipment"&#13;
which is the minimum SEdC national standard for school equipment. This will allow the&#13;
schools to offer the minimum level of SEdC required experiments as outline by the&#13;
national curriculum for primary school science. Library books per student will be&#13;
increased from approximately 5 to 8 in Sichuan, 4 to 10 in Shaanxi and 3 to 5 in Ningxia.&#13;
New desks and chairs purchased under the project will, by the end of the project, provide&#13;
100 percent of the needed furniture for project schools (Annex.2Q).&#13;
3.33   Student Assistance (Base Costs $3.05 million). Approximately 57,000 students&#13;
in the project areas will be supported for the five years of the project by both current,&#13;
ongoing government and non-government financing schemes as well as project&#13;
counterpart funding. These 57,000 students can be divided into two groups of school-age&#13;
children requiring financial assistance: approximately 23,000 poor students currently&#13;
receiving financial assistance who would drop out of school if financial assistance were&#13;
not available; and approximately 34,000 out-of-school children who are not in school&#13;
because of poverty. A number of channels are already well established for providing&#13;
financial assistance for the first group of students. The channels include financial&#13;
allocations from central, provincial, prefecture, and county governments, work-study&#13;
programs in primary schools, Hope Foundation, the Spring Bud Program, and other&#13;
sources. However, government allocations constitute the major source for supporting&#13;
existing poor students.&#13;
3.34 Assuming support of Y 50 per student per year, the total aggregate funding&#13;
needed, agreed and committed by SEdC on behalf of itself and the three QVPEP&#13;
provinces is approximately Y 24.8 million ($3.0 million). This includes current ongoing&#13;
funding which is guaranteed to be continued through the five years of the project, and&#13;
both direct funding and interest from education funds9 interest necessary to support new&#13;
students who are currently not enrolled in school.&#13;
3.35 The levels of support needed and confirmed by each project province to keep&#13;
currently enrolled students in school and bring those not currently enrolled into the school&#13;
system, by province, are:&#13;
9 Education funds generate interest income on deposits initially from government and eventually from&#13;
non-government sources. Controlled and supervised by Provincial govemments. The initial deposit of&#13;
funds for the foundation is provided by the Provincial Education Commissions from their education&#13;
budgets.&#13;

Levels of support for each child will depend on actual need and be based on levels of&#13;
family rural per capita income. The scope of support for individual students will range&#13;
from partial subsidy of textbooks to full payment of textbook and all schooling fees plus&#13;
partial expenses (including food) in boarding schools, or from roughly Y 20 to 120 a&#13;
year.&#13;
3.36  Direct funding of all new students during the first year and a portion of those&#13;
students in year two through five is acknowledged by the SEdC as necessary in order to&#13;
support students until the interest income of the education funds begins to come in the&#13;
second year, and to keep the size of the initial deposit into the educational funds&#13;
manageable and feasible. Direct funding of all students currently out of school for&#13;
economic reasons will be necessary in year one of the student assistance scheme because&#13;
interest income from the educational funds will not yet be available. In year two through&#13;
year five a combination of direct funding and indirect funding from interest income on&#13;
education funds (see para. 3.38). The levels of this direct student assistance funding has&#13;
been assured and will be confirmed at negotiations.&#13;
3.37   Educational funds will be established in the three provinces in order to provide&#13;
partial indirect interest-supported funding for the students currently out of school. The&#13;
following initial deposits will have to be made in order to generate, at a prospective 8.0&#13;
percent interest rate, sufficient income to allow for the support of the target number of&#13;
students. The estimated levels of investment in the funds are as follows:&#13;
Province                           Level of Investment&#13;
y&#13;
Ningxia                                           2,000,000&#13;

Sichuan                                           8,500,000&#13;
0 Fund investment is the amount of money which must be invested at the establishment of the fund in&#13;
order to provide adequate funding for a sufficient number of students for years two through five of the&#13;
project using a unit cost of Y 50 per student to be supported.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
3.38  Administration and monitoring of the student assistance program are critical&#13;
and will follow recommendations made by Yunnan Province (on selection criteria and&#13;
targeting poor children for receipt of support according to levels of rural per capita&#13;
income) and Shaanxi Province (on the administration of the student assistance process).&#13;
School principals and classroom teachers will be able to nominate children, both those&#13;
about ready to go to school and those in school, for support. Reporting of all expenses in&#13;
the scheme will be done annually. The CEP will monitor the implementation of the&#13;
student assistance program on an annual basis and report any irregularities to the&#13;
provinces, the SEdC and the Bank. In addition, an appropriate level of provincial control&#13;
of the educational funds is an important principle of administration and will be required&#13;
by the project. (See Annex 21 for details of the management of the student assistance&#13;
program.) The borrower provided the Bank at negotiations, for review and approval,&#13;
draft administrative guidelines for the program based on the procedures developed by&#13;
both provinces.&#13;
3.39  The student assistance programs for the QVPEP component of the overall project&#13;
is of major importance to the project goal of providing quality education to the absolute&#13;
poor. Without student assistance to both bring currently non-enrolled children into&#13;
school and keep currently enrolled students in school, approximately 57,000 children, or&#13;
12 percent of the school age children in the project area might not be able to have access&#13;
to primary education. Recognizing the substantial impact of poverty on the enrollment&#13;
patterns of children in the 26 very poor QVPEP counties, the three project provinces and&#13;
the SEdC have allocated $3.0 million of the counterpart funds to support the student&#13;
assistance program. This is approximately 20 percent of overall counterpart funding for&#13;
the QVPEP and substantially higher than the projected 3.3 percent of counterpart funding&#13;
for student assistance in the National Program. Therefore, recognizing the importance of&#13;
the QVPEP Student Assistance Program in ensuring increased enrollments of children&#13;
from families of the absolute poor, the different sources of funding necessary for both the&#13;
direct and indirect funding of the Programn, and the large initial amounts of funding&#13;
critical to provide student assistance during the first year of the project, both direct&#13;
funding and for the initial deposits in the educational fund, the establishment of the&#13;
student assistance programs acceptable to IDA for the three project provinces with the&#13;
full initial deposits described in paragraph 3.35 will be a condition of project&#13;
effectiveness.&#13;
Education Quality Enhancement Component (Base Costs $1.35 million)&#13;
3.40  Teacher Training. Teacher training under the project will upgrade the skill level&#13;
of unqualified teachers and minban teachers as well as provide continuing education for&#13;
qualified teachers. The training activities will give teachers new professional skills as&#13;
well as provide them with the opportunity to interact with colleagues in the teaching&#13;
profession. Through improved teacher knowledge acquired during the training activities,&#13;
the project area villages and townships will experience better quality of education.&#13;
Training institutions at all levels have been operating effectively and there is no&#13;
foreseeable problem with the training capacity in the provinces and counties. Under the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
project the teacher training activities will include: academic qualification training;&#13;
multigrade teaching training, laboratory teacher training, librarian training, and&#13;
continuous education. Each Province has prepared draft Terms of Reference for their&#13;
teacher training activities taking into consideration an appropriate balance between&#13;
teaching methodology and subject matter. Upon completion of the project it is expected&#13;
that the qualification rate for teachers in the project areas will increase to 94.8 percent for&#13;
Sichuan, 95.5 percent for Ningxia, and 90 percent for Shaanxi.&#13;
Education Management Improvement Component (Base Costs $0.10 million)&#13;
3.41  Management Training. Management capacity is essential to the implementation&#13;
of the proposed project. To improve the capacity of the administrative system in&#13;
monitoring and implementing the project, the project has included a management training&#13;
component. Project management training for provincial education staff will be provided&#13;
at the national level by the SEdC. Upon completion of the national level training, the&#13;
PEdC will provide management training to the Directors of the project county education&#13;
bureaus. The Foreign Investment and Loan Office (FILO) of the SEdC will also conduct&#13;
training for provincial and pilot county staff who are in charge of civil works,&#13;
procurement, financing and project management.&#13;
Environmental Aspects and Program Objective Categories&#13;
3.42  No negative environmental impact from  the project is anticipated.  No&#13;
resettlement or land acquisition is foreseen in that all new civil works will be&#13;
construction, extension, rehabilitation or repair of schools on existing school sites.&#13;
Improved access to and quality of basic education will enhance the ability of the poor to&#13;
take advantage of the opportunities presented by economic growth, either in their own&#13;
counties or areas of faster economic development. Improved overall access to education&#13;
will increase girl's enrollments. The project, through its targeted training programs, will&#13;
increase the numbers of women teachers and principals and thus encourage enrollment&#13;
and retention of girls in schools. It has been shown that improved quality of education in&#13;
general also increases the retention of girls, with resultant economic and social benefits.&#13;
Special attention has been paid, through a participatory process, to design the project so&#13;
as to ensure that the minority beneficiaries fully benefit from the project, in accordance&#13;
with the requirements of the Bank Group's Operational Directive 4.20. (See paras.&#13;
2.24-2.32.)&#13;
3.43  Community participation in the design of the project, especially in minority areas,&#13;
was a key element of project preparation. Village Committees in which parents are active&#13;
participants have been and will continue to be important in supporting many school&#13;
activities including school construction and repairs, payment of minban teachers and&#13;
sometimes accommodation of teachers, ensuring that all children enroll in school, and&#13;
introduction of local content in local curriculum. Local community participation during&#13;
project implementation will occur by direct and indirect means. Direct participation can&#13;
be seen in parental participation in school meetings, usually two or three times a term, to&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
discuss their children's school work and their cocurricular activities at school. Teachers&#13;
also make several visits each term to discuss with parents their children's study program&#13;
and their performance in school, providing parents with another opportunity to provided&#13;
an input into their children's learning. It will be important for Village Committees to&#13;
continue to function during the life of the project and contribute to the success of project&#13;
implementation. Both SEdC and the CEP should, on their regular site visits, meet with&#13;
the Committees to ensure their continued contribution to school level project&#13;
implementation. (See para. 4.6.)&#13;
D. PROJECT COSTS&#13;
3.44 National Program (NP). The project cost for the National Program is estimated&#13;
at $136.67 million equivalent, with a foreign exchange component of $15.20 million&#13;
equivalent, excluding taxes and duties. Project costs are summarized by component in&#13;
Table 3.1 and by category in Table 3.2. (See Annex 22 for detailed tables.)&#13;
3.45 Qinba Village Primary Education Program (QVPEP). The project cost of the&#13;
Qinba Village Primary Education Program is estimated at $28.53 million equivalent, with&#13;
a foreign exchange component of $4.01 million equivalent, excluding taxes and duties.&#13;
Project costs are summarized by component in Table 3.4 and by category in Table 3.5.&#13;
(See Annex 23 for detailed tables.)&#13;
3.46  Unit Costs. Base costs for both programs are expressed in June 1996 prices.&#13;
Civil works costs are based on construction of similar schools in 14 pilot counties in&#13;
1995. Costs of equipment, books and materials are based on contracts for similar items&#13;
awarded recently. Technical assistance costs for internationally recruited experts include&#13;
costs of salaries, allowances and airfares, and are based on 1995 SEdC experience.&#13;
Technical assistance costs for local training are based on spring 1996 actual costs&#13;
provided by SEdC.&#13;
3.47 Contingency allowances have been estimated as follows. For local expenditures,&#13;
8.5 percent for 1997, 7.0 percent for 1998, 6.5 percent for 1999, and 6.2 percent&#13;
thereafter; and for foreign expenditures, 2.5 percent for 1997-2003.&#13;
E. FINANCING PLAN&#13;
3.48 National Program (NP). IDA will finance $70 million equivalent, and the&#13;
provinces, local municipalities and counties $66.6 million. The Credit will cover all the&#13;
foreign exchange requirements and about 78 percent of local costs. The financing plan is&#13;
given in Table 3.3. The proposed Credit will be made available by MOF to the project&#13;
provinces at an annual interest rate of 1.2 percent or less. The provincial governments'&#13;
debt service obligation for the total Credit will be negligible. During negotiations,&#13;
assurances were obtained from the Borrower that it will make a part of the proceeds of&#13;
the Credit available to all nine Project Provinces (including Q VPEP) for their Education&#13;
Programs on the following terms: repayment over 17 years (with 5 years grace), interest&#13;
at 1.2 percent per year or less. The provincial governments will bear the foreign&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 39-&#13;
exchange risks on those proceeds. Each project province will allocate the Credit&#13;
proceeds to its counties, as far as possible on a grant basis, otherwise on terms at least&#13;
as favorable as those terms on which the province receives the funds from the central&#13;
government.&#13;
3.49 Qinba ViUlage Primary Education Program (QVPEP). IDA will finance&#13;
$15 million equivalent, and the provinces, local municipalities and counties&#13;
$13.53 million. The Credit will cover all the foreign exchange requirements and about 73&#13;
percent of local costs. The financing plan is given in Table 3.6. The proposed Credit will&#13;
be made available by MOF to the project provinces at an annual interest rate of 1.2&#13;
percent or less. The provincial governments' debt service obligation for the total Credit&#13;
will be negligible.&#13;

F. SUSTAINABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY&#13;
3.50  The project will partially finance school-based activities at the village, township,&#13;
county and provincial level, and SEdC activities which are embedded within, and support&#13;
the key national education policy of achieving universal 9-year education by the year&#13;
2000. In addition, the project will cover a small number of normal schools. The&#13;
moderate level of IDA financing for the project (approximately 50 percent) and the&#13;
annual levels of counterpart funding necessary for the project as a ratio of the actual 1995&#13;
provincial and county education budgets (0.89 and 3.3 percent, respectively, on average)&#13;
increase both the chances for sustainability and affordability of the project activities.&#13;
Additionally, the source of provincial counterpart funding is balanced and sustainable-&#13;
on average approximately 35 percent from the county and 65 percent from the province&#13;
and prefecture level. Likewise, the poverty reduction focus of the project is central to the&#13;
Government's 7-year plan to eliminate absolute poverty by the year 2000, a plan that&#13;
specifically aims at upgrading education and literacy in backward and poor areas. Built&#13;
into the project are maintenance costs for schools, classrooms and equipment procured&#13;
under the project, equipment procurement, technical assistance and training to develop a&#13;
planning-enhancing MIS system. The training of approximately 130,000 teachers and&#13;
school managers builds and strengthens existing and new human resource capacity which&#13;
will remain in place after the implementation of the project. (See Anne   I for detailed&#13;
data.)&#13;
3.51 The financial sustainability of the project is assessed by comparing the projected&#13;
total recurrent costs of compulsory education in project counties in 2002 with the&#13;
projected recurrent budgets for compulsory education in these counties in that year. (See&#13;
Annex 24 for detailed Economic and Financial Analysis.) Total recurrent cost in 2002 is&#13;
the sum of the total regular recurrent costs of personnel and nonpersonnel inputs in 2002&#13;
and the total annual recurrent cost implication of the project. The total annual recurrent&#13;
costs implication of the project is equal to the sum of the annual costs needed to maintain&#13;
the effectiveness of project investments in school buildings, equipment, furniture, and&#13;
technical assistance. In this analysis, the annual costs of maintenance of an education&#13;
input is estimated to be the product of a coefficient for that input and the project&#13;
investment in that input. The coefficient will vary across education inputs and across&#13;
project counties. It is between 2 and 3 percent for school buildings, between 3 and 4&#13;
percent for equipment, between 1 and 2 percent for furniture, and between 0.1 and&#13;
0.3 percent for technical assistance. The projected recurrent budgets in 2002 were&#13;
estimated on the basis of the actual recurrent expenditure in 1995 and a historical growth&#13;
rate.&#13;
3.52  The final results of the analysis are incorporated in the revised feasibility reports&#13;
prepared by the provincial representatives. The total annual recurrent cost implications of&#13;
the project investment have been found to be a small percentage of the projected 2002&#13;
total recurrent costs at the provincial level. The aggregate results for the project counties&#13;
are given in Annex 25. The project-related recurrent costs to be borne by the project&#13;
counties are expected to be manageable.&#13;

4. PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A. MANAGEMENT OF PROJECT IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
4.1   National Level Implementation. Both the National Program (NP) and the Qinba&#13;
Village Primary Education Program (QVPEP) will use the same implementation structure&#13;
and mechanisms (Annexes 26 and 27). SEdC, through the Education Management&#13;
Component, will implement national level project activities in which each province has a&#13;
shared involvement (see para. 3.24-3.30). These activities will include: (a) national-level&#13;
management training for provincial trainers, education managers and administrators, and&#13;
project implementation staff; (b) centrally-organized seminars and workshops in support&#13;
of various project components, including the organization of overseas study tours;&#13;
(c) support for the Chinese Experts Panel which will assist FILO/SEdC in the monitoring&#13;
of the project; and (d) monitoring and evaluation, largely through the preparation of&#13;
evaluative reports, which will include management and utilization of EMIS to strengthen&#13;
administration and implementation. To expedite implementation of centrally-managed&#13;
activities, MOF will provide a one-time approval of the activities which have been agreed&#13;
with provinces during project preparation. MOF will release allocated budget funds in&#13;
tranches. FILO, with the assistance of appropriate technical departments of SEdC, such&#13;
as teacher training, and the administrative resources used satisfactorily in past projects,&#13;
will monitor and supervise the project's implementation goals. FILO will make&#13;
supplementary changes in management of the project when necessary, keeping IDA&#13;
informed about these changes.&#13;
4.2   The SEdC's responsibilities in project implementation would be increased under&#13;
this project, in view of its growing capabilities and experience with IDA-financed&#13;
operations. Specifically, SEdC will assume responsibility for:&#13;
(a)   carrying out national level training activities (including a limited number&#13;
of overseas training programs and study tours) in accordance with an&#13;
action plan acceptable to the Association;&#13;
(b)   coordination and oversight of project implementation carried out at the&#13;
national, provincial, prefectural and county levels;&#13;
(c)   review of goods and works procurement procedures to make sure they are&#13;
being carried out in accordance with the Development Credit Agreement&#13;
(DCA). This will include pre-screening procurement procedures and&#13;
arranging for joint procurement where appropriate.&#13;
(d)   carrying out periodic supervision, jointly with provincial authorities, of&#13;
action plan implementation at the provincial, prefectural and county levels.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-46 -&#13;
This will entail review meetings at the provincial level and site visits to&#13;
selected project counties; and&#13;
(e)   preparation of a Mid-Term report by June 30, 2000, and implementation&#13;
completion report in a format agreeable to the Association.&#13;
Assurances were sought at negotiations that a national level Project Implementation&#13;
Office (in FILO), reporting to a Vice Minister of SEdC, will be maintained throughout the&#13;
duration of the project, with terms of reference, staff members and resources acceptable&#13;
to the Association. The Education Management Improvement component will be carried&#13;
out in accordance with a program acceptable to IDA and to this effect the Borrower will&#13;
prepare and furnish to IDA, not later than October 31 each year, a proposed action plan&#13;
for implementation of the component during the following year and thereafter implement&#13;
this annual plan, as approved by IDA. The provincial and national action plans for the&#13;
first year of implementation were reviewed and cleared at negotiations.&#13;
4.3   Provincial Level Implementation. The actual implementation of the project will&#13;
take place at county-level in the provinces. However, the major management and&#13;
coordination of county project activities will be the responsibility of PEdCs under the&#13;
guidance of FILO/SEdC. Before implementation gets underway, a project launch&#13;
workshop would be carried out. SEdC will be responsible for national-level activities in&#13;
which provinces will be participants. At the provincial level, Foreign Investment and&#13;
Loan Offices have been formed, headed by the Deputy Directors of the respective PEdCs,&#13;
and staffed with officials experienced in education planning and management, financial&#13;
management and accounting, civil works and equipment. Assurances were obtained at&#13;
negotiations that Provinces will maintain project offices with responsibility to coordinate&#13;
project implementation, with TORs, technical/professional staff and resources&#13;
acceptable to IDA.&#13;
4.4   Education Programs (see para. 3.5) are those activities that have been reviewed,&#13;
appraised and found acceptable by IDA as project-supported activities. As a condition of&#13;
participating in the Project, each province would enter into Education Program&#13;
Implementation Agreements (EPIAs), consisting of the arrangements to ensure the proper&#13;
implementation of the Education Programs, with the Borrower, through the PEdC. All&#13;
nine provinces have prepared and furnished to the Borrower action plans, acceptable to&#13;
the Association, for the first year of implementation. Action plans would provide&#13;
detailed information on implementation planned for all the project components. As a&#13;
condition of effectiveness the Borrower will provide the Association with provincial&#13;
Education Program Implementation Agreements, acceptable to the Association, made&#13;
between the Borrower and each of the nine project provinces for carrying out the&#13;
provinces' Education Programs. During negotiations, assurances were obtained that&#13;
provinces will furnish annual provincial action plans to IDA by October 31 each year,&#13;
and thereafter carry out the plans as approved by the Borrower and IDA. The action&#13;
plans will include the following year's civil works plan, maintenance plan, staff training&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 47 -&#13;
plan and a program to ensure participation of village committees in the implementation&#13;
of the project.&#13;
4.5   County Level Implementation. While the management of implementation in&#13;
project counties is the responsibility of the PEdCs, actual implementation will be the&#13;
responsibility of the County Education Bureaus. All project civil works, for example,&#13;
will be carried out at the county level, in townships and rural villages. Training for&#13;
county level project implementation staff will be organized by the PEdC. County-level&#13;
project implementation offices (or county-level FILOs) will replicate those at the&#13;
provincial level. The establishment of such offices should be a condition of participation&#13;
in the Project and thus would be a prerequisite for concluding EPIAs with each province.&#13;
Assurances were obtained at negotiations that provinces will ensure that County&#13;
Education Bureaus will maintain project offices with TORs, staffing and resources&#13;
acceptable to the Association throughout the project implementation period&#13;
4.6   The Chinese Experts Panel (CEP). The CEP has been organized by SEdC to&#13;
assist in the implementation of the project at the national, provincial and county levels.&#13;
The Panel, comprising representatives from the Government, educational research units&#13;
and universities, will report to FILO/SEdC. The chief functions of the Panel are to assist&#13;
FILO/SEdC in: (a) advising provinces and counties on the development of education&#13;
plans; (b) advising on the development and implementation of staff training activities,&#13;
both in country and overseas; (c) periodically monitoring implementation progress by&#13;
reviewing project indicators and the participation of Village Committees in the&#13;
monitoring of locally relevant curricula; (d) assisting FILO in monitoring the educational&#13;
achievement targets for the project provinces' nonproject supported counties;&#13;
(e) monitoring the implementation of innovative strategies and pilot activities including&#13;
the student assistance program, the teacher service network, the dissemination program&#13;
and the textbook rental scheme; and (f) providing an evaluative report at Mid-Term. The&#13;
role and responsibilities of the CEP are elaborated in Annex 19. In order to ensure the&#13;
proper carrying out of the Project, assurances were obtained that the Borrower would&#13;
maintain throughout the period of Project implementation, with terms of reference,&#13;
membership and other resources acceptable to the Association, a CEP with responsibility&#13;
for providing technical advice to project Provinces on the development and&#13;
implementation of their Education Programs and to SEdC on the development and&#13;
implementation of training programs and the monitoring of overall activities.&#13;
B. MONITORING, REPORTING AND SUPERVISION&#13;
4.7   Monitoring and Evaluation. The project includes activities and processes aimed&#13;
at strengthening national, provincial and local monitoring evaluation capacity. While&#13;
FILO/SEdC has overall responsibility for monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E), its&#13;
effectiveness will depend on the cooperative contribution made by every provincial and&#13;
county/municipal implementing agency. At provincial, prefecture and county levels, the&#13;
project will include personnel training linked with the establishment or upgrading of&#13;
Educational Management Information Systems (EMIS). Efforts will be made to assist&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 48 -&#13;
provincial and county levels in organizing data collection and analysis in order to monitor&#13;
and evaluate project implementation as well as local level M&amp;E capabilities in general.&#13;
4.8   Performance Monitoring Indicators and Implementation Targets. Project&#13;
performance indicators have been identified by provinces working together with counties&#13;
and SEdC for primary, junior secondary and for normal schools. These will be used to&#13;
track the implementation progress of project activities as they move toward their targets.&#13;
The comprehensive range of detailed indicators selected per province reflects the&#13;
commitment of stakeholders and beneficiaries to project objectives and mirrors their&#13;
involvement in project design. Data on indicators will be available for every participating&#13;
school will be collected biennially for the years 1998, 2000 and 2002 (base year data for&#13;
1995 have been provided). The table format would provide an important tool for&#13;
operating the EMIS. Data from the provincial-level consolidated table should provide all&#13;
the basic information required for updating the Annual Action Plan, preparation of the&#13;
Annual Progress Report, the Mid-Term Review, the Implementation Completion Report,&#13;
and any post-implementation impact evaluation study. (See Annex 28 for mid-term&#13;
review scope and content.)&#13;
4.9   Central to project monitoring and supervision is the reporting mechanism which&#13;
will be reflected in the EPIAs. At the various levels, reports would provide, in a&#13;
systematic fashion, essential information on implementation of project components.&#13;
Project schools will report to County Education Bureaus which will analyze and&#13;
consolidate school level data for the county level Annual Progress Report (APR) which&#13;
will be submitted to the provincial FILO. Apart from the data, descriptive analyses of&#13;
project implementation will be provided by PEdCs. These would capture disparities in&#13;
project implementation and performance, providing signals for possible remedial action.&#13;
FILO/PEdCs will similarly analyze all county reports to present a consolidated APR to&#13;
FILO/SEdC. FILO/SEdC then will analyze and submit to IDA, by April 1 annually, a&#13;
national APR based on the provincial reports, providing a national perspective on project&#13;
achievements. Normal schools will provide individual institutional APRs directly to&#13;
provincial FILOs which will include these in their APRs to FILO/SEdC. The reports will&#13;
be based on the implementation targets and project activities identified in the Action&#13;
Plans by county, province and SEdC, with progress evaluated and monitored on the&#13;
indicators found acceptable to IDA, SEdC, provinces and counties. Additional sources of&#13;
information for the reports would include: annual reports from the CEP; FILO/PEdC&#13;
supervision reports; and, particularly in the latter years of the project, data from the&#13;
computerized EMIS. All implementing entities will use reporting formats reviewed and&#13;
approved at appraisal. The flow of communication should travel in both directions: all&#13;
implementing agencies and institutions should receive copies of the final report from&#13;
FILO/SEdC to provide a project-wide perspective on activities and achievements.&#13;
4.10 The APRs will be the main sources of information for the Mid-Term report to be&#13;
prepared by FILO/SEdC, assisted by the CEP, and should reach IDA at a specified time&#13;
before the Mid-Term Review meeting. The APRs will provide the necessary quantitative&#13;
information and the qualitative evaluation for the preparation of the Implementation&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 49 -&#13;
Completion Report (ICR), the joint responsibility of FILO/SEdC and the Association,&#13;
when the project is completed.&#13;
4.11  Supervision. The project is expected to be completed by June 30, 2002, and will&#13;
be implemented over a five-year period, plus six months for the completion of payments&#13;
and full withdrawal of Credit proceeds. The Credit is thus expected to close by&#13;
December 31, 2002.&#13;
4.12  During project implementation, periodic missions from the Association will&#13;
review the progress of project implementation, according to a Supervision Plan&#13;
(Annex 29) and based on indicators presented in Annex 8, respectively. SEdC/FILO,&#13;
with the assistance of the Chinese Experts Panel, will monitor progress on a province by&#13;
province basis using indicators agreed for each province.&#13;
4.13  Each year, IDA and the SEdC will jointly review the progress toward completion&#13;
of the annual action plans and approve the following year's annual action plan. Annual&#13;
reports on the progress of project implementation will be prepared by FILO, beginning&#13;
April 1, 1998, based on information received from review meetings, operational units and&#13;
agencies of the project. These reports will give special attention to the development of&#13;
the EMIS, teacher training activities, and the dissemination program. A Mid-Term&#13;
review will take place prior to and FILO will produce a Mid-Term report by June 30,&#13;
2000. A project implementation 'completion report will be prepared by FILO and&#13;
submitted to the Association within six months of the closing of the project Assurances&#13;
were obtained at negotiations that: (a) using data provided by PEdCs by March 1, the&#13;
Borrower through SEdC will monitor and evaluate project progress on the basis of&#13;
indicators acceptable to the Association, andfurnish the Association the results of such&#13;
reviews by April I of each year; (b) a mid-term report will be prepared by FILO by&#13;
June 30, 2000; and (c) a project implementation completion report (ICR) will be&#13;
prepared by FILO and submitted to the Association within six months of the closing date.&#13;
C. PROCUREMENT&#13;
4.14 The Bank's Guidelines for Procurement under IBRD Loans and IDA Credits,&#13;
dated January 1995 and revised in January and August 1996, will govern the procurement&#13;
of goods and works under the project. In addition, the "Model Bidding Documents"&#13;
prepared by the Ministry of Finance in consultation with the Bank will be used for all&#13;
procurement under the project. Procurement arrangements are presented for the National&#13;
Program and for the Qinba Village Primary Education Program in Table 4.1.&#13;
4.15 Civil Works ($101.4 million). This includes new construction as well as major&#13;
and minor repairs of school buildings. Most of the schools are in small villages or&#13;
dispersed rural areas in remote locations with construction spread over time resulting in&#13;
high mobilization cost for foreign contractors and therefore it is unlikely that foreign&#13;
contractors will be interested in bidding. New construction and major repairs costing&#13;
$100,000 or more each will be awarded through National Competitive Bidding (NCB)&#13;
under procedures acceptable to the Association. Small works contracts costing less than&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50 -&#13;
$100,000 up to an aggregate not to exceed $60 million equivalent will be obtained on the&#13;
basis of quotations from three qualified bidders and awards will be based on the lowest&#13;
qualified bid. Minor repairs and works may be carried out through force account up to an&#13;
aggregate of $25,500,000 with the Association's prior agreement. Suitable safeguards for&#13;
cost control and payment against performance will be incorporated and construction will&#13;
be coordinated by County Construction Bureaus and supervised by the Provincial&#13;
Construction Bureaus. Model bid documents prepared in China, in consultation with&#13;
IDA, will be used for NCB. Annual provincial civil works plans will be reviewed and&#13;
approved each year by IDA. The $25.5 million of works that will be carried out under&#13;
force account will be allocated by province by the Borrower and become Annex 30 of the&#13;
SAR. The procurement plans and an implementation plan are found in Annex 31.&#13;
4.16 Goods ($46.2 million). Experience with the implementation of earlier Bank&#13;
Group-supported basic education projects indicates that it is highly unlikely that&#13;
International Competitive Bidding (ICB) will be needed for procurement of goods&#13;
(classroom furniture and teaching equipment) for the project. However, should there be&#13;
equipment and materials procurement with contracts of $200,000 or above, they will be&#13;
awarded through ICB. To the extent practicable, contracts for goods shall be grouped&#13;
into bid packages estimated to cost the equivalent of $200,000 or more each. If ICB is&#13;
used, local manufacturers would be eligible for a margin of preference in bid evaluation&#13;
of 15 percent or the prevailing rate of customs duty, whichever is lower. Contracts&#13;
estimated to cost under $200,000 for primary, junior secondary and normal school&#13;
equipment, furniture, and materials up to an aggregate amount not expected to exceed&#13;
$32 million, and all book contracts, will be awarded through NCB procedures acceptable&#13;
to the Association. NCB will be used for procurement of books (aggregate value of $9.1&#13;
million) following procedures developed in the three earlier basic education projects.&#13;
Books are selected by schools, county and provincial education authorities from a list&#13;
prepared by SEdC and published by competing provincial book companies.  Past&#13;
experience and review of book procurement contracts indicate that competition, based on&#13;
price, has been the main factor in the awarding of provincial contracts for books.&#13;
Equipment and materials contracts with an estimated value of less than $30,000 each and&#13;
an aggregate amount equivalent to $5.1 million for the project will be awarded under&#13;
shopping procedures after solicitation and evaluation of at least three written price&#13;
quotations.&#13;
4.17 Consultant Services and Training ($12.1 million). Teacher training will be&#13;
contracted by County Education Bureaus with Teacher Training Institutions. IDA will&#13;
finance expenditures of the trainees for all the training programs.  Studies (i.e.,&#13;
dissemination program and student financial assistance program), and domestic and&#13;
international consultants will be selected by the provinces with the assistance of the CEP&#13;
and FILO using the Bank Group's standard form of contract for consultants' services, and&#13;
following guidelines on the Selection and Employment of Consultants by World Bank&#13;
Borrowers dated January 1997. As all consultants will be selected as individuals,&#13;
section 5 of the Consultant Guidelines will provide the basis for their selection and&#13;
employment. In the unlikely event the implementing agencies were to engage a firm,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
they would follow Quality Based Selection procedures. The aggregate amount for&#13;
training activities is $10.0 million and consultant services is $2.10 million. Details on&#13;
staff-months and costs are in Annex 11.&#13;
4.18   Review of Project Procurement Procedures. Prior review by the Association of&#13;
all stages of the bidding process will be required for: (a) the first two proposed works&#13;
contracts from each province annually throughout the project and all works contracts&#13;
valued at or above $200,000; and (b) the first two equipment contracts let by each&#13;
province and thereafter, all goods contracts valued at or above $200,000.  NCB&#13;
procurement for equipment is expected to take place through one major exercise in each&#13;
province with an appropriate number of packages for schools and equipment kits level.&#13;
The PEdCs will compile all equipment and book lists based on SEdC approved&#13;
equipment lists. These lists will be reviewed by the Equipment Bureau and approved by&#13;
the FILO Director. With regard to the proposed works contracts for which the Bank&#13;
Groups' prior review is required, SEdC will review them to ensure compliance with the&#13;
Bank Groups' requirements. The Resident Mission in China will prescreen these&#13;
documents prior to forwarding the contracts to headquarters for its review. In view of the&#13;
social objective of the project and using parameters developed in the previoUs basic&#13;
education project, prior review coverage will be of approximately 11 to 13 percent of&#13;
goods contracts and 4 to 6 percent of works contracts. Prior review will be required for&#13;
all consultant contracts with firms valued at $100,000 or more and for all contracts with&#13;
individuals valued at $50,000 or more.&#13;

D. DISBURSEMENTS&#13;
4.19 The proposed IDA Credit for $85.0 million equivalent will be disbursed over a&#13;
period of 5 years as shown in Table 4.2 and Annex 32. The percentages of disbursement&#13;
for each expenditure category under the Credit are given in Table 4.2, and follow a&#13;
disbursement profile derived from earlier Bank Group experience in basic education and&#13;
teacher training projects, especially ones which contain a substantial amount of civil&#13;
works. Reimbursements will be based on full documentation except for: (a) training&#13;
programs; (b) contracts for works valued at less than $200,000 and goods valued at less&#13;
than $200,000 equivalent, except for the first two works contracts per province per year&#13;
and the first two goods contracts per province; and (c) contracts for consulting firms&#13;
valued at $100,000 equivalent or less and for individual consultants' contracts valued at&#13;
$50,000 equivalent or less, which will all be reimbursed on the basis of Statements of&#13;
Expenditure (SOEs). This SOE threshold has been established based on the good prior&#13;
experience with the implementing agency in the earlier three basic education projects and&#13;
the nature of the project. The provincial project units will be responsible for preparing&#13;
withdrawal applications. County project units will prepare withdrawal applications for&#13;
submission to the Provincial Project Unit, which will submit the withdrawal applications&#13;
to the Provincial Finance Bureaus who will forward them to the Ministry of Finance&#13;
(MOF). MOF will review the applications and submit them to the Association.&#13;
Documents supporting the SOEs will be retained by the MOF and made available for&#13;
information to SEdC and inspection by IDA supervision missions. Retroactive financing&#13;
of up to 10 percent of the Credit amount ($8.5 million equivalent) is recommended to&#13;
cover payments already made under the project starting from January 1, 1997 for training&#13;
activities and March 15, 1997 for civil works contracts.&#13;

established in a bank, and on terms and conditions satisfactory to the Association. It will&#13;
be replenished monthly or whenever it is drawn down to half its initial deposit level,&#13;
whichever occurs first. Disbursements for staff training in China or study tours abroad&#13;
will be made from the Special Account against the actual cost of travel, subsistence and&#13;
training fees incurred.&#13;
4.21   Accounts and Audits. Provincial accounts will be maintained by the provincial&#13;
finance bureaus with reports submitted to the MOF. National project accounts and details&#13;
of the Special Account will be maintained by MOF. Annual audits will be performed by&#13;
independent auditors acceptable to the Association, and a consolidated audit report sent to&#13;
the Association. At negotiations, assurances were obtained that a consolidated annual&#13;
audit report of national and provincial project accounts and the Special Account would&#13;
be submitted to the Association within six months of the end of each Government fiscal&#13;
year, and that the audit will contain a separate opinion regarding the SOEs.&#13;

5. BENEFITS AND RISKS&#13;
A. BENEFITS&#13;
5.1   As a result of the project, coverage of basic education will provide better access to&#13;
schools and will benefit about 6.2 million poor children, who are the direct beneficiaries,&#13;
in some of China's poorer provinces. The civil works component will benefit 2,936&#13;
primary schools and 771 junior secondary schools. The project is expected to provide&#13;
243,000 new places for primary schools and 135,000 at the junior secondary level. It will&#13;
significantly expand basic education among the poor, especially in the remote areas&#13;
inhabited by minority nationalities. Targeted student assistance programs for children in&#13;
the very poorest counties, minorities and girls, will provide opportunities for a more&#13;
equitable utilization of development resources, while contributing to improved rates of&#13;
enrollment, transition from primary to junior secondary education, and completion for&#13;
primary and secondary schooling. An expanded, sustainable student assistance program,&#13;
focused on the poorest counties in Sichuan, Shaanxi and Ningxia, will be established.&#13;
Provision of education to remote and rural areas not only helps to create opportunities for&#13;
rural development but also provides local inhabitants the skills necessary to participate in&#13;
economic growth in township and urban centers. Almost all schools in project counties&#13;
will benefit from the project in some form.&#13;
5.2   The quality of primary and junior secondary schooling would be improved&#13;
through the training of teachers and principals, with targeted training for female&#13;
principals. The project will provide varying lengths of training for approximately&#13;
138,000 teachers, trainers and education managers. The Teacher Services Network&#13;
would be established as a sustainable, ongoing, local quality enhancement mechanism&#13;
imparting new teaching approaches and pedagogical methods, which respond directly to&#13;
teacher needs at the rural village school level. Innovative strategies and successful&#13;
experiences in the education for girls and minorities would be documented and&#13;
disseminated widely within and across provinces, reinforcing the impetus for better&#13;
quality in teaching of these target groups through greater awareness of issues and&#13;
strategies. Learning achievement indicators would indicate positive, incremental changes&#13;
in specified content areas in selected counties.&#13;
5.3   The education management system would be improved through specific training&#13;
interventions at county, province and national levels. The project support for the EMIS&#13;
and the reporting and feedback mechanism established to facilitate a two-way&#13;
communication flow would strengthen the system as a whole. Together with training&#13;
interventions, the improved management practices would have a spin-off effect on&#13;
nonproject counties as a direct result of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

B. RISKS&#13;
5.4   The tight fiscal situation in participating provinces and counties may result in&#13;
insufficient counterpart funding to match IDA credit funds. To reduce this risk, the&#13;
project preparation team has been working with provincial authorities to accurately&#13;
estimate and plan for counterpart funds, using both data from past years and future&#13;
projections to assess counterpart funding and the financial sustainability of the project.&#13;
Experience from implementation of the earlier basic education projects shows that the&#13;
county level provision of counterpart funding has not been a problem with civil works&#13;
targets, the component where the bulk of the counterpart money is being used and which&#13;
is likely to run ahead of project schedules. All nine project implementing agencies at the&#13;
national and provincial levels have demonstrated experience in handling these&#13;
responsibilities effectively in earlier projects.&#13;
5.5    The project's inclusion of nine provinces increases the risk of successful&#13;
implementation problems. However, the experience of all nine provinces in previous&#13;
projects provides them with a strong basis for effective implementation of the current&#13;
project. Additionally, in the three provinces of the QVPEP, 12 of the participating 26&#13;
counties are already implementing other IDA supported education projects, and their&#13;
experience enhances likelihood of successful implementation.&#13;
5.6    Critical to the success of the QVPEP is increasing the number of poor children&#13;
enrolled in schools which provide good quality education. A risk in the project is that the&#13;
proposed interventions will neither raise enrollments nor provide the necessary quality&#13;
education. Issues of poverty and quality of teaching have been recognized by the design&#13;
team by developing a special, poverty-focused student assistance program with funding&#13;
from counterpart sources, and with specific modalities designed to provide the financing&#13;
necessary to get the children into schools. Likewise, special teacher training programs,&#13;
focusing on upgrading the skills of the teacher trainers have been incorporated into the&#13;
project design. The project preparation team is confident that these focused activities will&#13;
enable the project counties and provinces to achieve their ambitious educational targets.&#13;
5.7    Equally critical to the success of the QVPEP is adequate funding of the student&#13;
assistance program for the 26 poor counties in this component. It is estimated that&#13;
approximately $3.0 million will be necessary to both keep 23,000 students in school who&#13;
are currently receiving funding and bring 34,000 non-enrolled children into schools. This&#13;
amount is approximately 20 percent of the projected counterpart funds for the project. In&#13;
order to mitigate this risk, the participating provinces will, as a condition of project&#13;
effectiveness, establish their student assistance programs with the full and initial deposits&#13;
(see para. 3.41). IDA will monitor the number of poor children needing financial&#13;
assistance in the 26 project counties, the continuing availability of existing student&#13;
support funds, new direct funding sources need to augment the income from the&#13;
educational foundations, and the interest income of the education foundations to assure&#13;
adequate funding for this part of the project.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
5.8   There is some uncertainty in the project's ability to reach the enrollment targets&#13;
for girls and minorities. To mitigate this risk, the project has included counties and&#13;
institutions where the majority population is of minority nationality. Efforts made&#13;
through the dissemination program would be of help to counter traditional negative&#13;
parental and community attitudes to schooling for girls. For both minorities and girls,&#13;
earmarked funds from the student assistance program have been targeted to increase&#13;
enrollments at both primary and junior secondary levels, but funds available are as yet&#13;
insufficient to meet the needs. To deal with this, SEdC has two approaches: first, to&#13;
increase direct transfers for capital funds at project entities from the center; and second, to&#13;
stress to all implementation units that increased enrollments for these disadvantaged&#13;
groups is part of the national plan for NYCE.&#13;
5.9   Earlier projects have shown that inadequate two-way communication between&#13;
state, provincial and county authorities have slowed project implementation.  To&#13;
minimize this risk, logistical support in the form of monitoring, evaluation and reporting&#13;
mechanisms has been set up, reinforced by incremental improvements in the EMIS in all&#13;
project entities.&#13;

ANNEX 1: HOUSEHOLD EDUCATION SPENDING IN&#13;
SHANXI AND YUNNAN&#13;
A. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS&#13;
1.    This is a study of household education spending (HES) and access to basic&#13;
education in four nationally-designated poor counties in China: Loufan and Liulin in&#13;
Shanxi, and Luxi and Jiangchen in Yunnan. The major findings are as follows:&#13;
1.    HES averaged between 396 yuan to 802 yuan per year in the four counties in&#13;
1995. It constituted a significant part of household spending and net income, averaging&#13;
between 16.8 percent to 34.0 percent of the total spending of a household, and between&#13;
13.7 percent and 20.3 percent of the net income of a household.&#13;
2.   In 1995, HES was a heavy economic burden for a significant proportion of&#13;
households. For example, for 22-40 percent of the households in the four counties, HES&#13;
accounted for at least 20 percent of total household spending. And for 22-31 percent of&#13;
the households in the four counties, HES accounted for at least 20 percent of household&#13;
net income.&#13;
3.    HES per child increased sharply with the level of schooling. In 1995, HES per&#13;
child averaged 190 yuan for primary education, 482 yuan for lower-secondary education,&#13;
and 1143 yuan for upper-secondary education. However, HES per child varied&#13;
substantially across the four counties: it ranged between 117 and 269 yuan for primary&#13;
education, between 272 and 1149 yuan for lower-secondary education, and between 464&#13;
and 3103 yuan for upper-secondary education.&#13;
4.    Among the four counties, Luxi County in Yunnan had the highest percentage of&#13;
children aged 7-15 years not in school. In 1995, 6.3 percent of boys and 20.0 percent of&#13;
girls in this age groups were not in school in this county. Economic difficulty was the&#13;
reason indicated by 61 percent of parents who provided an explanation for their children's&#13;
absence from school. For the other three counties, between 2.4 and 4.2 percent of&#13;
children aged 7-15 years were not in school.&#13;
5.   In three of the four counties, parents have a higher desired level of educational&#13;
attainment for boys than for girls. The majority of parents in all four counties want their&#13;
children to have a post-secondary education.&#13;
6.    For the majority of parents in Loufan, Liulin, and Luxi (counties with 0 to 37&#13;
percent minority population), their desired level of education attainment for their children&#13;
is not economically attainable. In contrast, the great majority of parents in Jiangchen&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 60 -                    ANNEX 1&#13;
(with 83 percent minority population) think that their desired level of educational&#13;
attainment for their children is economically attainable.&#13;
7.    The great majority of parents in the four counties support a prompt&#13;
implementation of a textbook rental scheme to reduce the private cost of compulsory&#13;
education. Between 90 to 100 percent of parents in Loufan, Liulin, and Jiangchen want&#13;
to have a prompt implementation of a textbook rental scheme. In Luxi, 70 percent of&#13;
parents support implementation or experimentation of a textbook rental scheme; 30&#13;
percent oppose such a scheme.&#13;
8.    Difficulty with the language of instruction appears to be a minor problem in&#13;
Yunnan. Only 3 percent of parents think that their children have difficulty with&#13;
Putonghua. Between 1.3 to 3.2 percent of parents think that school should use bilingual&#13;
instructional materials.&#13;
9.    There is a compelling need to reduce the economic burden of household education&#13;
spending. Alternatives for reducing such spending should take account of variations and&#13;
diversities in different areas in China.&#13;
B. BACKGROUND&#13;
10.   The International Development Association of the World Bank Group is currently&#13;
assisting the Government of the People's Republic of China (China) in the preparation of&#13;
the Fourth Basic Education Project. This project covers 91 poor counties in the six&#13;
provinces of Guizhou, Yunnan, Hainan, Shanxi, Hunan, and Heilongjiang. The project&#13;
will contribute to the World Bank's involvement in the education sector in China,&#13;
namely, poverty reduction, teacher training, and the promotion of girls and minority&#13;
education in China.&#13;
11.   As part of the preparation of this project, this study examines household education&#13;
spending (HES) in four poor counties covered by the project. It is aimed at estimating the&#13;
magnitude of HES, assessing the economic burden of HES on households, and exploring&#13;
the impact of HES on access to compulsory schooling (grades 1-9) for children from poor&#13;
backgrounds. The findings may be used to inform decisions regarding alternative&#13;
strategies for reducing the economic burden of the direct private costs of compulsory&#13;
education.&#13;
C. METHODOLOGY AND BASIC STATISTICS OF SAMPLE&#13;
12.   Household education spending (HES) consists of expenditures by households on&#13;
children's schooling, such as expenditures on miscellaneous school fees, textbooks,&#13;
stationery, as well as additional expenditures on clothing, food, and other boarding costs&#13;
as a result of schooling. HES usually increases with the level of schooling. The&#13;
economic burden of HES can be assessed by determining the extent to which households&#13;
have to devote their resources to schooling. Two common indicators are used: HES as a&#13;
percentage of total household spending, and HES as a percentage of household net&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-61-                      ANNEX 1&#13;
income. Additional evidence comes from information on household borrowing and&#13;
subsidy for schooling purposes. The impact of the economic costs of schooling (HES&#13;
plus the foregone benefits of child labor) may be explored by examination information on&#13;
the absence of school-aged children from schooling, and parents' explanation for such&#13;
absence.&#13;
13.   This study consists of a survey of 100 households in each of four project counties.&#13;
With input from the State Education Commission (SEdC), China, an instrument was&#13;
designed to collect the necessary information.  SEdC also provided the overall&#13;
coordination for data collection. The data were actually collected in June-July, 1996 by&#13;
the socioeconomic survey teams of the State Statistics Bureau in the concerned counties.&#13;
The households were selected on the basis of a sampling strategy used by the State&#13;
Statistics Bureau in its annual rural household survey. For both provinces, 1996&#13;
information on basic statistics of households was collected; 1995 information was&#13;
obtained on household income and household expenditure on various items, including&#13;
education.&#13;
14.   Among the four counties, two are located in Shanxi Province (Loufan County and&#13;
Liulin County), and two are located in Yunnan Province (Luxi County and Jiangchen&#13;
County). Table 1 provides basic statistics on the four counties, for all the households in&#13;
the survey as well as for households in the survey with children in school. Compared&#13;
with the counties in Shanxi, the counties in Yunnan have more minorities, have larger&#13;
family size, have more children in school, and have much lower educational attainment&#13;
for mothers relative to fathers. In China, minority families are allowed to have more&#13;
children than the Han majority. The two counties in Yunnan have significantly different&#13;
level of per-capita income. The two counties in Shanxi are quite similar to one another.&#13;
Table 2 shows the distribution of children by level of schooling in the sample.&#13;
15.   Findings on household education spending in the four counties are discussed in&#13;
the following. Since the findings are based on a case study of counties with their&#13;
distinctive characteristics, careful consideration is necessary in generalizing the findings&#13;
to other poor counties in China.&#13;
D. HOUSEHOLD EDUCATION SPENDING&#13;
16.   Since most households in the four counties have more than one child in school,&#13;
one can examine how much a household spends on one child and on all children in&#13;
school.&#13;
Direct Private Costs (DPCs) of Schooling&#13;
17.   Table 3 shows how much households spent on each child's schooling (DPC) in&#13;
1995. There are obvious differences in DPCs across schooling levels, between counties,&#13;
and between boys and girls.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -                    ANNEX 1&#13;
18.   HES per student increased sharply with the level of schooling. For the four&#13;
counties, HES per student averaged 190 yuan for primary education, 482 yuan for lower-&#13;
secondary education, and 1,143 yuan for upper-secondary education. At the primary&#13;
level, most of the HES was on books and stationary. At the lower-secondary level,&#13;
spending on books remained a substantial part of total HES; however spending on the&#13;
"others" category (including spending on transportation, uniform, boarding, and other&#13;
items) was also significant. At the upper-secondary level, "others" and fees were the&#13;
largest spending categories.&#13;
19.   However, HES per child varied substantially across the four counties: it ranged&#13;
between 117 and 269 yuan for primary education, between 272 and 1149 yuan for lower-&#13;
secondary education, and between 464 and 3103 yuan for upper-secondary education.&#13;
Jiangchen, which had the lowest per-capita net income in 1995, also had the lowest per-&#13;
student spending at each level of schooling.&#13;
20.   At the primary level, the DPCs for boys and for girls were basically the same in&#13;
the four counties. At the lowest-secondary level, the DPCs for girls were clearly higher&#13;
than those for boys in three of the four counties; however the opposite is true in the fourth&#13;
county.&#13;
Total Household Education Spending&#13;
21.   Total HES is the sum of household spending on all the children's schooling. Row&#13;
(1) of Table 4 shows that, on the average, total HES amounted to 436 yuan in Loufan,&#13;
443 yuan in Liulin, 802 yuan in Luxi, and 396 yuan in Jiangchen. Luxi had the highest&#13;
HES because families in Luxi spent more per student and had more students per family&#13;
(see Table 1 and Table 3). Jiangchen had the lowest HES because it had the lowest per-&#13;
student HES, even though it had the highest number of students per family.&#13;
E. ECONOMIC BURDEN OF HOUSEHOLD EDUCATION SPENDING&#13;
HIES as a Proportion of Total Household Spending&#13;
22.   One common international measure of the economic burden of HES is HES as a&#13;
percentage of total household spending (abbreviated as EBS). Presumably, a household&#13;
with a higher EBS has a heavier economic burden than another household with a lower&#13;
EBS. Row 2 of Table 4 shows that this spending-based measure averages between 16.8&#13;
percent for Loufan households to 34.0 percent for Luxi households. These averages are&#13;
significantly higher than the 2-4 percent levels for the rural and urban households in the&#13;
Beijing Metropolitan area, and the 1-4 percent levels for a number of developing&#13;
countries&#13;
23.   Assume that 20 percent is the threshold level above which economic burden of&#13;
schooling is considered heavy. Row 3 of Table 4 shows that between one-fifth and two-&#13;
fifths of the households had a heavy economic burden in 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 63 -                    ANNEX 1&#13;
24.   Row 4 of Table 4 shows a measure of economic burden preferred by education&#13;
officials in China. This measure is the ratio of the sum of HES of all the households with&#13;
children in school to the sum of the total household spending of all the households with&#13;
children in school. It shows the proportion of the total spending of all households (with&#13;
children in school) in a county that is devoted to the schooling of children in the county.&#13;
HES as a Proportion of Household Net Income&#13;
25.   Another common international measure of the economic burden of schooling is&#13;
HES as a percentage of household net income (abbreviated as EBI). Again, a higher EBI&#13;
is presumed to be associated with a heavier economic burden. Row 5 shows that EBI&#13;
averages between 13.7 percent for Jiangchen households to 20.3 percent for Luxi&#13;
households. It also shows that between 22.0-31.0 percent of the households in the four&#13;
counties have EBIs that are higher than the threshold level of 20 percent.&#13;
F. ABSENCE FROM SCHOOL AND ECONOMIC BURDEN&#13;
26.   Table 6 presents the percentage of children aged 7-12 years and 7-15 years not in&#13;
school. It shows that the absence rates were higher for Yunnan counties than Shanxi&#13;
counties. For the two counties in Shanxi, absence rates for boys and for girls are quite&#13;
similar. However, this is not the case in Yunnan. For Luxi, girls' rates are about three&#13;
times those of boys. For Jiangchen counties, boys' rates are higher than girls' rates. It is&#13;
instructive to note that 83 percent of the population in Jiangchen are minorities; and&#13;
minority parents in Jiangchen do not have a bias against girls with respect to schooling.&#13;
27.   Parents were asked about the reason for their children's absence from school. For&#13;
Luxi county in Yunnan, which had the highest absence rates among the four counties, 61&#13;
percent of parents indicated economic burden of HES to be the reason for their children's&#13;
absence from school. Economic burden of HES was not quoted as the reason for school&#13;
absence in the other county in Yunnan. In Shanxi, one-sixth of parents in Loufan and&#13;
one-third of parents in Liulin mentioned the economic burden of HES to be the reason for&#13;
their children's absence from school.&#13;
G. PARENTAL EDUCATION EXPECTATION&#13;
28.   Parents' schooling decisions (such as decisions regarding school attendance and&#13;
amount of HES) are related to their education expectation for their children. In this&#13;
study, parents were asked about the level of schooling that they would like their children&#13;
to attain. The majority of parents want their children to have post-secondary education&#13;
(see Table 7). Overall, parents in Yunnan counties have higher educational expectation&#13;
than those in Shanxi. Except for Liulin County, parental educational expectation is&#13;
higher for boys than for girls.&#13;
29.   The survey also asked parents to compare the economically-attainable level of&#13;
education with the desired level of education for their children. The gap between the two&#13;
reflects partly the influence of private costs of schooling on educational attainment.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 64 -                    ANNEX 1&#13;
Table 8 shows that, for Loufan, Liulin, and Luxi counties, desired level of education&#13;
exceeds economically-attainable level of education for the majority of families.&#13;
However, for Jiangchen, the desired level of education matches the economically-&#13;
attainable level of education for 73 percent of the families. The results for boys and girls&#13;
are similar.&#13;
H. PARENTS' VIEW ON TEXTBOOK RENTAL SCHEME&#13;
30.   As indicated in Table 3, spending on textbooks constitutes a significant part of&#13;
total household spending on education. Reducing household spending on textbooks is&#13;
one way of reducing household spending on education and thus the economic burden of&#13;
such cost. In this study, parents were asked about their opinion on a textbook rental&#13;
scheme for reducing household spending on textbooks. According to this scheme,&#13;
parents pay the cost of a set of textbooks at the beginning of the schooling year. At the&#13;
end of the school year, they can return the textbooks for a partial refund or credit for&#13;
purchasing next year's textbooks. Table 9 shows that the great majority of parents in&#13;
three of the four counties do want to have a prompt implementation of such a scheme.&#13;
Opposition to the scheme is found in Luxi where 30 percent of the parents do not want to&#13;
have such a scheme.&#13;
I. LANGUAGE OF INSTRUCTION&#13;
31.   Yunnan province has a significant proportion of minority population. Parents in&#13;
the two Yunnan counties were asked two questions concerning the language of&#13;
instruction in primary school. The first question deals with proficiency in Putonghua (the&#13;
"common" language used by the Han majority). About 97 percent of the parents think&#13;
that their children are proficient in understanding and speaking Putonghua. 3 percent of&#13;
the parents think that bilingual instruction is needed because of their children's difficulty&#13;
with Putonghua. The second question concerns the use of bilingual instructional&#13;
materials in school. Between 1.4 and 3.2 percent of the parents indicate that school&#13;
should use bilingual instructional materials. The great majority of parents think that there&#13;
is no need to use such materials.&#13;
J. CONCLUSIONS&#13;
32.   Household education spending constitutes a significant part of total household&#13;
expenditure or net household income. It is a heavy economic burden for 20 to 40 percent&#13;
of households in the four poor counties in Shanxi and Yunnan. Difficulty with the&#13;
private costs of schooling is an important contributing factor for children's absence from&#13;
school. For most of the households in this study, their desired level of education for their&#13;
children is not economically attainable. There is thus a compelling need to reduce the&#13;
private costs of schooling, as part of the overall effort to achieve nine-year compulsory&#13;
education in China. Alternatives for reducing such costs should be considered and&#13;
experimented, including the establishment and strengthening of a student-assistance&#13;
progran, and a textbook rental scheme. These alternatives should also take account of&#13;
variations and diversities in different areas in China.&#13;

and (c) for all countries worldwide 14.&#13;
2.    What are the main technical design lessons learned from these audit reports?&#13;
From the OED reports and relevant IDA projects in related sectors in China, the lessons&#13;
learned are as follows:&#13;
(a)   Project design should not be overly complex or overly optimistic in its&#13;
expectations. Greater awareness of the difficulties of expanding and&#13;
improving education in impoverished areas should take this into&#13;
consideration in project design.&#13;
(b)   An effective monitoring and evaluation systems should be established&#13;
prior to project implementation to assess project development impact.&#13;
(c)   Early involvement and participation of stakeholders especially at the&#13;
county level, helps to ensure smooth implementation, accountability and&#13;
sustainability.&#13;
(d)   In projects with larger proportions of civil works in dispersed&#13;
impoverished rural areas there is a need to include an architect on the&#13;
Bank project assistance team.&#13;
3.    What are the main policy and institutional design lessons learned from these&#13;
audit reports? From the OED reports and relevant IDA projects in related sectors in&#13;
China, the lessons leamed are as follows:&#13;
(a)   Follow-up projects pursuing similar objectives to those of previous&#13;
projects help to strengthen and eventually consolidate earlier&#13;
achievements, which might otherwise falter and fade away. Thus, follow-&#13;
up projects should be part of a long-term investment program with clearly&#13;
defined objectives based on sound sector work.&#13;
(b)   Importance of ownership on the part of the implementing agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-66-                       ANNEX2&#13;
(c)   Importance of sustained commitment on the part of the borrower to&#13;
provide the necessary resources to support basic education.&#13;
(d)   The project should be flexible enough to accommodate mid-course&#13;
corrections in scope, content, and approach. Experts panels should be&#13;
established to review implementation address issues relevant to mid-&#13;
course corrections.&#13;
(e)   Increasing access for girls, minority and poor children to quality primary&#13;
education must be addressed by innovative enrollment policies and student&#13;
assistance programs.&#13;
4.    How has the proposed project design benefited, if at all, from the above&#13;
review of lessons learned?&#13;
(a)   The project began with a joint Bank/Borrower training course on project&#13;
design, which included individuals from the preparation and implementing&#13;
agencies. The utilization of monitorable indicators was a component of&#13;
the project training course. (2a, 2b)&#13;
(b)   The borrower and provincial education authorities have been responsible&#13;
for organizing the participation of stakeholders at the provincial and&#13;
county levels to develop proposals which include local level identification&#13;
of issues and optimal solutions. Because this is a repeater project, this&#13;
process was facilitated by using experiences and models from earlier&#13;
projects. (2c, 3a, 3b)&#13;
(c)   A Chinese experts panel has been used to assist in the design of project&#13;
components and will be used during project implementation to provide&#13;
ongoing high level professional monitoring of project implementation.&#13;
(2b, 3a, 3d)&#13;
(d)   A county financing study and household survey has been initiated to better&#13;
understand what the necessary commitment is for sustaining appropriate&#13;
levels of support for basic education. (3c)&#13;
(e)   The innovation component aims at supporting action oriented research&#13;
programs that will identify innovative approaches to improving access for&#13;
girls, minorities and poor children. (3e)&#13;

ANNEX 7: PILOT TEXTBOOK RENTAL SCHEME&#13;
1.    Rationale. Household spending on education is a heavy economic burden for a&#13;
significant proportion of households in China, especially households from poor&#13;
backgrounds. Surveys of households in several provinces in China have shown that such&#13;
an economic burden is an important contributing factor to parents' decision not to send&#13;
their children to school. Reducing the costs of schooling to families is a strategy for&#13;
promoting access to compulsory education in China. In primary education, textbook&#13;
costs constitute the largest component (30-40 percent) of household education spending&#13;
at that level. Reducing the cost of textbooks to parents is thus a significant way of&#13;
reducing household spending on primary education. The overall purpose of this pilot&#13;
activity is to study the feasibility of the scheme and, if successful, to disseminate its&#13;
findings in other poor areas within the provinces as well as other provinces.&#13;
2.    Objectives. By reducing the cost of textbooks to parents, this project activity&#13;
seeks to achieve three objectives:  (a) improving access to compulsory education;&#13;
(b) improving efficiency in the utilization of scarce resources; and (c) promoting&#13;
students' discipline and care of books.&#13;
3.    Organizational Arrangements. The textbook rental scheme will be piloted in 4&#13;
village schools in 2 counties in Shanxi Province under the aegis of SEdC and the PEdC.&#13;
The Shanxi PEdC will be responsible for designing, implementing and evaluating the&#13;
activity. The pilot will be organized as described below:&#13;
3  A Project Management Group (PMG) will have overall responsibility. It will&#13;
comprise education researchers from the Higher Education Institute of&#13;
Taiyuan Industrial University, education administrators from the concerned&#13;
county education bureaus and the principals from pilot schools.  The&#13;
responsibilities of the PMG will be to develop the project action plan; train the&#13;
operational staff; supervise the utilization of funds; ensure that the suitably&#13;
protected (plastic, cloth) textbooks become available to students; monitor the&#13;
progress of the pilot; and organize annual exchange of experience. The&#13;
researchers from the University will be responsible for analyzing the results of&#13;
the pilot and writing up the report.&#13;
*  A Project Implementation Group (PIG) will also be established. It will&#13;
comprise pilot school principals, staff from the instruction divisions of the&#13;
county education bureaus and pilot class teachers. The responsibilities of the&#13;
PIG include awareness and information campaigns among parents and pupils,&#13;
carry out the operational activities of the scheme, and collect, collate and&#13;
document the results of the pilot.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -                     ANNEX7&#13;
4.    The guidelines for participating counties and schools include the following&#13;
(details are available in project files):&#13;
* parents pay for the full cost of a set of textbooks (about Y 70 per year in 1996)&#13;
at the beginning of the school year;&#13;
* at the end of the school year, parents return the textbooks to the school for a&#13;
partial refund or credit towards the purchase of textbooks in the next school&#13;
year;&#13;
* the amount of refund or credit will depend on the condition of the returned&#13;
textbooks to be determined by the PIG;&#13;
* the school will re-issue the returned textbooks to students in the following&#13;
year; and&#13;
* the activity will be tried out in Grades 1-6.&#13;
5.    Activities.&#13;
(a)   September 1997: Training for principals and teachers of pilot schools on&#13;
running the pilot scheme; awareness campaigns among parents and pupils;&#13;
new books will be wrapped with protective plastic covers;&#13;
(b)   February 1998:  Review the utilization experience and cover new&#13;
textbooks for the second school term;&#13;
(c)   July 1998: Collect all rental books, provide refunds as required, identify&#13;
and record reasons for nonreturn books;&#13;
(d)   September 1998: Begin next round of distribution and monitoring of&#13;
books;&#13;
(e)   September 1999: Review scheme, take note of damaged books, take&#13;
decision on whether to continue with another cycle;&#13;
(f)   October 1999: Collate and analyze data from pilot schools;&#13;
(g)   March 2000: Complete the analysis and report.&#13;
6.    Outcomes. Lessons will be learned on how to implement a textbook rental&#13;
scheme. Reactions of parents, school personnel, students, administrators, and textbook&#13;
publishers will be documented. Provinces will have the opportunity to discuss the&#13;
outcomes and adopt such schemes if they are found to be workable.&#13;
7.    Costs. The activity will be designed such that it will not affect the existing&#13;
procedures in the production of textbooks. The personnel involved (in the pilot schools&#13;
and in the County Education Bureau) will carry out this activity as part of their regular&#13;
work. There will be some relatively small spending on book shelves, plastic covers, and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -                     ANNEX7&#13;
materials for documenting the project activity. The funding will come from counterpart&#13;
finds.&#13;
8.    Monitoring and Evaluation.  The Shanxi PEdC, with the assistance of&#13;
researchers from Taiyuan Industrial University, will devise appropriate measures for&#13;
monitoring and evaluating the scheme on the bases of the three objectives (para. 2). The&#13;
evaluation will identify conditions that contribute to the effectiveness or otherwise of the&#13;
scheme in each of the pilot schools. A report will be prepared for the Mid-Term Review.&#13;
9.    Benefits. The activity will contribute to the identification of conditions for&#13;
designing an effective textbook rental scheme. As indicated in the economic and&#13;
financial analysis, the potential savings in textbook costs are substantial. The three&#13;
objectives are all important benefits.  Should the scheme pose implementation&#13;
difficulties, important lessons would have been learnt about the sources of such&#13;
difficulties. The investment cost is small compared to the potential benefits.&#13;
10.   Risks.&#13;
(a)   Poor quality of paper;&#13;
(b)   Poor quality of plastic cover, offering inadequate protection;&#13;
(c)   Negative habits of pupils toward caring for books;&#13;
(d)   Some parents may not support the scheme, wanting to keep textbooks for&#13;
review purposes;&#13;
(e)   Some parents' preference for new books for children; and&#13;
(f)   Frequent changes in textbooks which will undermine the effectiveness of&#13;
such a scheme.&#13;
11.   Sustainability. The State Education Commission will provide assistance in the&#13;
dissemination of the findings of this pilot activity. If found workable where reviewed,&#13;
both Project and nonproject provinces will have the opportunity to establish such&#13;
schemes, adapting them as appropriate to suit local conditions.&#13;

ANNEX 12: TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR JUNIOR&#13;
SECONDARY SCIENCE TEACHERS&#13;
1.    Rationale.  Qualitative deficiencies exist in teacher performance due to&#13;
inadequate pre-and in-service training of science teachers. Teacher training has not kept&#13;
pace with the curriculum changes in science and mathematics. It is imperative to re-train&#13;
teachers through well planned inservice training programs in science teaching. The&#13;
strategies and inputs set out below could be modified for initial teacher training&#13;
programs.&#13;
2.    Objectives&#13;
(a)   To improve knowledge and professional skills of junior secondary science&#13;
teachers;&#13;
(b)   To improve the pedagogic skills of all junior secondary science teachers;&#13;
(c)   To provide high quality resources for inservice training of science teachers&#13;
with special focus on school-based staff development; and&#13;
(d)   To promote initiative and innovation at school level through fostering&#13;
cooperation between local schools in providing for their own staff&#13;
development.&#13;
3.    Strategies&#13;
(a)   Develop self-study training modules for science teaching in basic&#13;
education with assistance from best available science educators;&#13;
(b)   Initiate a training of trainers program with specific roles assigned to&#13;
teacher training institutions;&#13;
(c)   Establish a sustainable system of summer schools/inservice training using&#13;
the modules as the main instructional material; and&#13;
(d)   Using self study modules, encourage the establishment of a school-based&#13;
staff development system through pilots.&#13;
4.    Inputs. SEdC's Teacher Training Department is preparing and trialing a set of&#13;
training materials based on an evaluative survey of available teacher training resources.&#13;
Apart from specially planned training programs, in order to improve the quality of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-91-                       ANNEX 12&#13;
trainers who are to use the materials with their trainees, inputs should be estimated to&#13;
provide the following:&#13;
(a)   Institutional responsibility for development of modules;&#13;
(b)   Panel of experts, comprising of both content and education technology&#13;
experts, to write modules;&#13;
(c)   Trial and validation of modules;&#13;
(d)   Inservice training strategy involving county-based teacher support&#13;
programs, summer schools or short-term inservice training, with clearly&#13;
defined roles; and&#13;
(e)   One of the planned inservice inputs is a workshop for approximately 50&#13;
trainees to be held in May 1998 at Yunnan Agriculture University in&#13;
Kunming, Yunnan Province. Trainees will include one international&#13;
consultant and two local consultants. Details are available in project files.&#13;
5.    Assumptions&#13;
(a)   This is a major effort, rather a movement, involving upgrading of science&#13;
trainers and teachers to improve science education and requires careful&#13;
planning.&#13;
(b)   Development of self study modules is crucial as through good learning&#13;
resources average teachers' trainers could become more effective.&#13;
(c)   School-based staff development would ensure reaching out to a large&#13;
number of teachers. Provinces and counties may want to assess the&#13;
catalytic efforts of the primary level Teacher Services Network and&#13;
consider the feasibility of establishing a network along fairly similar lines&#13;
at the junior secondary level with a focus on science teaching.&#13;
(d)   Improving science teaching at the junior secondary science level is critical&#13;
to the Government of China's reform plans for broad-based economic and&#13;
social development. For the majority of rural junior secondary graduates,&#13;
the program is the terminal point of their formal education experience.&#13;
Key messages received and skills developed will have long-term spin-offs&#13;
for agriculture, environment, income generation, occupational mobility,&#13;
nutrition and general family health, to name a few outcomes. The existing&#13;
centrally-planned curriculum includes much of this content but the&#13;
majority of trainers nor teachers have the skills required to impart this to&#13;
students.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 92 -                    ANNEX 13&#13;
ANNEX 13: TEACHER SERVICES NETWORK&#13;
1.    Objective. The Teacher Services Network (TSN) will provide professional&#13;
services which would support village level, school-based activities aimed at increasing&#13;
understanding and knowledge of teaching and learning, improving pedagogical skills, and&#13;
developing peer interaction to reduce professional isolation. The TSN will be piloted in&#13;
two selected counties in each of the six project provinces.&#13;
2.    Guidelines for Setting Up the TSNs. This Annex describes general guidelines&#13;
to be considered when setting up the TSNs in the various provinces. They were discussed&#13;
and identified during project preparation. In order to assess the practical working of such&#13;
a Network, Yunnan Province will pilot a TSN in its Honghe region and some prefectures&#13;
in Luxi county. (See project files for a detailed description of Yunnan's proposal.)&#13;
Provinces will draw from the results of the pilot and the guidelines in this Annex as a&#13;
basis for developing their own Network strategies.  Irrespective of the specific&#13;
organizational arrangements, professional support to village school teachers' problems&#13;
and difficulties will remain the focal point of this activity.&#13;
3.    Organizational Arrangements. The TSN will be developed along the following&#13;
guidelines, with appropriate local variations:&#13;
(a)   TSN Centers (the Center) will form the hub of the Network and Town&#13;
Central Primary Schools (TCPSs) in the twelve selected pilot counties will&#13;
be designated as TSN Centers;&#13;
(b)   TSN Organizing Group. The TSN will be organized at the county level by&#13;
a coordinating group comprising representatives from the prefecture level&#13;
Normal School, County Teaching and Research Group (within the County&#13;
Education Bureau) and the principal of the TSN Town Central Primary&#13;
School. The Normal School representative will head this group which will&#13;
ensure systematic planning, free flow of information and professional&#13;
input.&#13;
(c)   The TSN Teachers' Group will be formed, comprising TSN Town Central&#13;
Primary School principal (as head) and teacher representatives from the&#13;
village schools and teaching points served by the Center. This group will&#13;
identify and respond to teacher needs and liaise with the TSN Organizing&#13;
Group to form a two-way dialogue channel (see Figure attached).&#13;
(d)   The Normal School Curriculum Review Group comprising the Vice&#13;
Principal (Professional), the designated Head of Department who will&#13;
oversee the TSN components and other appropriate faculty members. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 93 -                    ANNEX 13&#13;
group will ensure the inclusion of TSN awareness (including objectives,&#13;
organization, functions and activities) in the Normal School final year&#13;
syllabus.&#13;
4.    Activities&#13;
(a)   Immediate and short-term activities will include preparatory steps to be&#13;
taken prior to the launch of the Centers:&#13;
(i)    a village school and teaching point level survey to identify the&#13;
professional needs of teachers;&#13;
(ii)   the planning of a TSN Center Program based on the survey results;&#13;
and&#13;
(iii)   the organization of an induction course on the TSN concept and&#13;
relevance for TSN Organizing Group members;&#13;
(b)   Long-term activities would encompass the following:&#13;
(i)   dissemination of information pertaining to education policies,&#13;
pedagogical principles, and techniques of cost-effective use of&#13;
library books and instructional equipment and materials;&#13;
(ii)   annual monitoring of needs of village school and teaching point&#13;
teachers to develop appropriate programs and activities;&#13;
(iii)   popularization of the production and use of low-cost teaching aids&#13;
using locally available materials; and&#13;
(iv)   incorporation of village community contribution to develop a sense&#13;
of ownership, responsibility and pride in the promotion of primary&#13;
education in the community.&#13;
5.    Monitoring and Supervision. The progress of the TSN will be supervised and&#13;
monitored by the TSN Organizing Group under the guidance of the PEdC, SEdC and&#13;
CEP. To assist monitoring and evaluation of project activities, four groups of indicators&#13;
have been identified:&#13;
(a)   Input Indicators&#13;
* formation of TSN Organization Group&#13;
* formation of TSN Teachers' Group&#13;
* distribution of library books and equipment to TSN Center&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 94 -                    ANNEX 13&#13;
* preparation of induction course content for TSN Organization Group&#13;
(b)   Output Indicators&#13;
* village teachers' needs assessment survey&#13;
* preparation of annual plan for TSN Center based on survey results&#13;
*  conduct of induction course for TSN Organization Group&#13;
*  number of activities organized for teachers at TSN Centers&#13;
*  number of village and teaching point teachers attending activities&#13;
(c)   Qualitative Indicators&#13;
* number of teachers using methods and teaching/learning aids as a&#13;
result of TSN Center activities&#13;
&#149; number of lessons at which methods and teaching/learning aids are&#13;
used as a result of TSN Center intervention&#13;
6.    Risks. Factors which may interfere with the success of TSNs would include the&#13;
following:&#13;
(a)   change of personnel in the TSN Organizing Group and the TSN Teachers'&#13;
Group, particularly the Principal of the Central Primary School;&#13;
(b)   level of commitment to TSN among the education hierarchy from&#13;
provincial to town and village level;&#13;
(c)   poor selection and quality of equipment and books procured for TSN&#13;
activities;&#13;
(d)   inadequate budget allocations for TSN Center activities;&#13;
(e)   absence of maintenance budget for equipment; and&#13;
(f)   disruption of school schedule when teachers attend activities at TSN&#13;
Center during school term.&#13;
7.    Benefits&#13;
(a)   Village school teachers will have a regular channel of 'upward'&#13;
communication with those hierarchically above them.&#13;
(b)   More, importantly, they will have the means to communicate and interact&#13;
with peers regarding their daily teaching tasks.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 95 -                    ANNEX 13&#13;
8.    Substainability&#13;
(a)   Since this is fundamentally a locally-based activity, there is high&#13;
probability that it will be well-supported by the community. This has been&#13;
borne out in other countries such as Indonesia and Malaysia.&#13;

-97 -                     ANNEX 14&#13;
ANNEX 14: NORMAL SCHOOLS&#13;
1.    Rationale. Teacher training is the linchpin in the Fourth Basic Education's&#13;
program of expanding access to basic education, enhancing the quality of classroom&#13;
teaching and ensuring cost-effective utilization of laboratories, equipment and library&#13;
books.  Normal schools, which are usually under the jurisdiction of prefectural&#13;
governments, provide initial (residential) and inservice upgrading courses for unqualified&#13;
and qualified teachers for the primary level of schooling. All graduates are contracted to&#13;
return to their home areas.  Management capacity is weak and institutions are&#13;
inefficiently run with under-utilization of staff, space, equipment and libraries. Training&#13;
programs are heavily content based and textbook bound, with insufficient attention given&#13;
to the development of practical, classroom skills.&#13;
2.    Objectives&#13;
(a)   To provide training which will focus on updating of normal school trainers&#13;
training methods with special emphases on resource-aided, pupil-centered&#13;
and activity-oriented methodology;&#13;
(b)   To review the minority component of the training curriculum with the aim&#13;
of improving and expanding the content to suit local cultures and&#13;
conditions, bilingual education programs where required, and multigrade&#13;
teaching skills;&#13;
(c)   To provide effective human resources and institution management courses&#13;
for principals and other administrative personnel; and&#13;
(d)   To provide 46 normal schools training and resources to enhance their&#13;
inputs in the Teacher Services Network.&#13;
3.    Organizational Arrangements. The training programs for this sub-component&#13;
will be organized and managed by FILO/SEdC and SEdC's and PEdCs' Teacher Training&#13;
Department under the guidance of the CEP. The SEdC's Minority Education Department&#13;
will collaborate with the Teacher Training Department in those components relating to&#13;
the development and assessment of minority-related curriculum materials.&#13;
4.    Inputs. Approximately 7 percent of the total credit has been allocated for this&#13;
sub-component, with provincial distribution made a needs-basis. The planned project&#13;
inputs for 45 normal schools and one Teacher Training and Research Center (Hainan) are&#13;
the following:&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-98 -                      ANNEX 14&#13;
(a)   training will be provided for 120 trainers;&#13;
(b)   management training will be provided for 46 school principals;&#13;
(c)   training will be provided for 46 laboratory directors; and&#13;
(d)   instructional equipment, books and materials amounting to USD XX will&#13;
be provided.&#13;
5.    Outcomes. The following outputs are expected:&#13;
(a)   strengthening of trainees' practical skills development which include a&#13;
range of teaching approaches to cater to the varied entry levels and&#13;
backgrounds of rural trainees, and the production of low-cost audio-visual&#13;
teaching aids and instructional materials;&#13;
(b)   a better managed set of institutions with improved utilization of staff,&#13;
libraries and laboratories;&#13;
(c)   improved skills in adapting the national curriculum for minority and local&#13;
situations;&#13;
(d)   contribution  to  the  sustainability  of Normal School graduates'&#13;
participation in the Teacher Services' Network as every trainee would be&#13;
aware of its significance; and&#13;
(e)   a cohort of re-trained trainers who will upgrade the quality of normal&#13;
school programs.&#13;
6.    Monitoring and Supervision. The PEdCs will be responsible for monitoring on&#13;
a regular basis. FILO/SEdC and the CEP will guide the PEdC and the institutions in the&#13;
overall change process. PEdCs will incorporate institutions annual reports in their own&#13;
APR reports annually for FILO/SEdC and IDA.&#13;
7.    Risks.  Weak management capacity at prefectural level has been a major&#13;
weakness in the quality upgrading of Normal Schools in BE II. The PEdCs, with proven&#13;
ability to better manage and provide professional leadership to training institutions will&#13;
assume responsibility for managing the implementation of this component.&#13;

sent to IDA with the total set of annual project action plans.&#13;
6.    The Program will be reviewed during the overall Mid-Term Review. A joint&#13;
CEP/FILO report with an analysis of activities completed will be presented for discussion&#13;
at the Mid-Term Review. Plans for the second half of the project will be discussed.&#13;
7.    Monitoring  of the Program.   The Dissemination  Program  will be&#13;
assessed/monitored by the CEP, FILO/SEdC, PEdCs and IDA in terms of the number of&#13;
innovations and successful experiences documented, number disseminated, and the&#13;
number of counties and schools which would have introduced them to solve some of the&#13;
specific educational problems.&#13;

ANNEX 18: MANAGEMENT IMPROVEMENT&#13;
1.    The objective of strengthening sectoral managerial capability is part of a long-&#13;
term program of reinforcing on-going institutional strengthening activities financed by&#13;
the Bank Group: the Educational Development in Poor Provinces (EDPP) Project (Cr.&#13;
2339-CHA), the Basic Education in Poor and Minority Areas (BE-II) Project (Cr. 2651-&#13;
CHA, and the Third Basic Education (BE-III) Project (Cr.283 1 -CHA).&#13;
2.    The program involves training state, provincial, county and institutional staff to&#13;
enhance their skills in planning and administration, and monitoring and evaluation&#13;
(M&amp;E) of project implementation. The program will provide specialist services and the&#13;
appropriate equipment and materials for: (a) national-level management training for&#13;
provincial trainers, education managers and administrators, and project implementation&#13;
staff totaling about 2,300 personnel in the 91 project counties, (b) centrally-organized&#13;
seminars and workshops in support of various components, including the organization of&#13;
overseas study tours; and (c) improving the management and utilization of the&#13;
Educational Management Information System (EMIS) to strengthen general educational&#13;
administration and project implementation as part of a nationwide network through&#13;
CERNET (China Education and Research Computer Network) coordinated by the&#13;
Educational Management Information Center (EMIC). Overall guidance is provided by&#13;
FILO/SEdC and PEdCs. SEdC will organize and implement national-level project&#13;
activities in which each province has a shared responsibility, and the Chinese Experts&#13;
Panel will assist FILO/SEdC in monitoring project implementation.&#13;
3.    The EMIS in the project counties will be managed by about 200 staff. As a key&#13;
management tool, the EMIS will provide critical logistical support in education sector&#13;
management in general, and in project planning and implementation in particular. A&#13;
small component as measured by the funds earmarked for its development (total&#13;
investment $500,000), the EMIS nevertheless will have a potentially much larger impact.&#13;
Including BE-IV, the cumulative investment through earlier projects will amount to $12&#13;
million covering 620 counties. Properly organized and managed, the EMIS will have a&#13;
positive impact on raising the efficiency of project planning and implementation (e.g.,&#13;
annual action plans and annual progress reports), which would include M&amp;E of various&#13;
project activities, from civil works construction to equipment procurement and staff&#13;
training. The cumulative experience of project planning and implementation will help&#13;
improve the effectiveness of collecting, processing and analysis of education sectoral&#13;
data. This is expected to be an on-going process that will provide relevant up-to-date&#13;
information for policy formulation and successive project planning and implementation.&#13;
4.    As China undergoes rapid economic and social change in accord with its opening&#13;
up policy, correct and timely basic information on the expected demographic&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-104 -                    ANNEX 18&#13;
transformation and changes in size and distribution of the school-age population,&#13;
especially in rural and currently poverty-stricken areas, will have profound long-term&#13;
implications for the provision of education. The special areas needing attention include&#13;
maintaining the momentum of upgrading the quality of education through more effective&#13;
utilization of better-educated teachers, teacher-support services, and instructional&#13;
materials. Accurate information on all the above is the necessary foundation for an&#13;
effective management of the education sector. An effective EMIS will provide SEdC and&#13;
the PEdCs the logistical support for a modem education management system.&#13;
5.    SEdC will give special attention to ensuring that the EMIS computer hardware&#13;
and software will be compatible with those in the existing provincial and county EMISs&#13;
financed under previous Bank-supported projects and that staff will be provided the&#13;
appropriate training to operate the EMIS.&#13;

ANNEX 21: STUDENT ASSISTANCE GUIDELINES&#13;
9.    In order to ensure that primary school students are able to attend school in the&#13;
QVPEP project areas, Ningxia, Shaanxi and Sichuan provinces have established student&#13;
assistance programs that will support approximately 57,000 students each year in the&#13;
project areas for the five year project period. The provinces will assist these students&#13;
with ongoing government and non-government financing schemes as well as with&#13;
counterpart funding. The breakdown of resources and student numbers are as follows:&#13;

10.   Education Funds. An education fund will be established at the provincial or&#13;
county level with an initial deposit in a commercial bank account as indicated in Table 1.&#13;
(See provincial feasibility reports for details.) The annual interest from the education&#13;
account, along with ongoing direct government support will be used to assist poor&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
111 -                      ANNEX21&#13;
students by reducing the miscellaneous fees and textbook charges. Each province has&#13;
calculated the number of students to be supported based on the current interest rate of 8&#13;
percent. However, should the interest be less than 8 percent then each province ensures&#13;
that the agreed number of students, as indicated in Table 2, must be supported. In order&#13;
to support these students additional direct support from the provinces will be made&#13;
available. Should the interest rate increase, then the additional resources should be used&#13;
to increase the numbers of students receiving support.&#13;
11.   Selection Process. The primary selection criteria is based on family per capita&#13;
income. (See Ningxia, Shaanxi and Sichuan provincial feasibility report in the project&#13;
files for individual per capita income selection criteria.) Once family per capita income&#13;
has been determined, the next priority in the selection process will be to provide&#13;
resources to girls and minorities.&#13;
12.   County education bureau administrators will notify school principals of the&#13;
availability of resources. Teachers will visit the famnilies to detennine if they are eligible&#13;
and discuss the assistance program with the parents. Parents will make a request for the&#13;
student assistance to their children's schools and a tentative list of names will be&#13;
compiled of those students eligible for assistance. The name list will then be submitted to&#13;
the township for verification and forwarded to the county education bureau for final&#13;
approval and selection of recipients.&#13;
13.   The levels of individual support will vary depending on the individual provincial&#13;
criteria. However, the average level of support for each student will be Y 50/year. These&#13;
grants are meant to largely subsidize school costs although in cases of extreme poverty,&#13;
full support can also be expected. The stipend will not be allocated to individual students&#13;
or their families but instead will be given to the appropriate school or education group to&#13;
offset the costs of textbooks and school fees. The subsidies will be recorded and&#13;
available for audit by the Association as well as Government officials.&#13;
14.   Monitoring. Progress reports on the students will be provided each semester to&#13;
the county and provincial education bureaus. In addition: (a) the Bank supervision&#13;
mission will monitor the Education funds and the activities of the program; (b) the CEP&#13;
will assist in monitoring the overall implementation of this component, making&#13;
recommendations for modifications if necessary; and (c) county audit offices will audit&#13;
all accounts.&#13;

ANNEX 24: ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
1.    There are three major objectives for conducting economic and financial analyses&#13;
in project preparation and appraisal:  (a) informing project design so that project&#13;
resources are used more efficiently to achieve project goals; (b) assessing financial&#13;
feasibility to ensure that there are adequate resources to implement the project; and&#13;
(c) assessing financial sustainability to ensure that project outcomes can be sustained after&#13;
project completion.&#13;
2.    To achieve these major objectives, a variety of economic and financial analyses&#13;
have been conducted during the preparation of the Fourth Basic Education Project; these&#13;
analyses can be grouped into five areas: (a) overview of education expenditures;&#13;
(b) economic impacts of education in poor areas; (c) education and poverty reduction;&#13;
(d) financial aspects of project; and (e) internal efficiency improvement. The findings are&#13;
summarized briefly in the following. Details are given in the background documents&#13;
prepared for such analyses and can be found in the project file for economic and financial&#13;
analysis.&#13;
A. OVERVIEW OF EXPENDITURES IN THE EDUCATION SECTOR&#13;
3.    According to the government's strategic plan for education, the primary goals of&#13;
educational reform and development in China are to meet the changing human capital&#13;
needs of the growing economy and to contribute to poverty reduction. To achieve these&#13;
goals, the education system should achieve a number of broadly defined developmental&#13;
targets by the end of the twentieth century: a significant increase in the educational&#13;
attainment of the national population, further expansion of pre-employment education&#13;
and further education of the labor force, having appropriate stocks of different kinds of&#13;
skilled personnel to meet the needs of modernization, and establishing the basic&#13;
framework of an educational system with forward-looking and Chinese characteristics.&#13;
4.    A crucial part of these development targets concerns the attaimnent of nine-year&#13;
compulsory education. By the year 2000, primary education should enroll over 9 percent&#13;
of the school-age children and the enrollment ratio in lower-secondary education should&#13;
reach 85 percent. Compulsory education is seen by government policymakers as central&#13;
to education's contribution to economic growth and poverty reduction. While most of the&#13;
urban and coastal areas have already achieved nine-year compulsory education, the major&#13;
challenge lies in poor and inland areas. Besides intensifying local effort, these poor and&#13;
inland areas require additional support from higher levels of government to achieve their&#13;
compulsory education targets in a timely manner. From a national viewpoint, there&#13;
should be more government investment in compulsory education, especially in poor and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-115 -                     ANNEX24&#13;
inland areas. A review of education finance in China suggests that the government has&#13;
been moving in such a direction in recent years.&#13;
5.    The following table provides information on government expenditure on&#13;
education during the 1991-95 period.  Several changes in government education&#13;
expenditure between 1991 and 1995 can be observed: (a) education's share of total&#13;
government expenditure rose from 13.52 percent to 16.05 percent, reflecting the&#13;
government's increased commitment to education relative to other sectors; (b) the central&#13;
government's share in total education expenditure declined from 12.97 percent to 11.86&#13;
percent, consistent with the trend in decentralized educational financing initiated in the&#13;
1980s; and (c) higher education's share in total education expenditure decreased from&#13;
24.21 percent to 20.77 percent while the combined share for primary and secondary&#13;
education increased from 68.41 percent to 72.16 percent.&#13;

6.   In 1991, total education spending from all sources amounted to 73.15 billion&#13;
yuan, with 62.85 percent from government budgetary sources and 37.15 percent from&#13;
non-budgetary sources (enterprises, work study, education surcharges and levies, social&#13;
contributions, education fees, and others). Total education spending increased to 112.68&#13;
billion yuan in 1995 (in 1991 price), representing a real increase of 11.41 percent per&#13;
year. Even though the government spent more on education in 1995, its share dropped to&#13;
54.76 percent in 1995 because non-budgetary funds grew much faster than government&#13;
funds. These findings are consistent with financing trends during the second half of the&#13;
1980s and early 1990s. Thus non-budgetary sources have become more important over&#13;
time. Total education spending from all sources amounted to 3.38 percent of GNP in&#13;
1991 and 3.26 percent in 1995.&#13;

7.    Per-student expenditures on basic education have increased over time.  For&#13;
example, in primary education, per-student budgeted expenditure (from  government&#13;
budget) increased from 80 yuan (1992 price) in 1986 to 139 yuan in 1992. In general&#13;
secondary education, per-student budgeted expenditure increased from 224 yuan (1992&#13;
price) to 301 yuan over the same time period.&#13;

8.    While non-government sources have increased in importance over time, they also&#13;
contribute to substantial disparities in per-student education expenditure across regions in&#13;
China. In general, economically more developed regions can raise more non-government&#13;
resources for education than less developed regions. Also, because of low household&#13;
income and other adverse conditions, poor and inland regions are very limited in their&#13;

achieved. During the 1996-2000 period, the central government will spend 3.98 billion&#13;
yuan (with matching funds from provincial and local governments) to assist compulsory&#13;
education in poor areas.&#13;
B. ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF EDUCATION IN POOR AREAS&#13;
9.    Since the Fourth Basic Education Project is an investment project in basic&#13;
education in poor areas, the Association has attempted to quantify the economic impact of&#13;
basic education in poor areas in China in two ways: the economic return of basic&#13;
education for individuals, and the additional annual tax revenue for the local (county)&#13;
government.&#13;
Private Return to Basic Education&#13;
10.   Researchers at the Institute of Higher Education, Peking University, were asked&#13;
by the Association to estimate the economic return to basic education in poor areas in&#13;
China. The dataset for this study contains information on 3,709 rural residents from 23&#13;
poor counties in the six provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Yunnan, and&#13;
Guizhou in 1991. Four of these provinces (Hunan, Shanxi, Yunnan, and Guizhou) are&#13;
participating in the Fourth Basic Education Project. The analysis found that education&#13;
and earnings were significantly and positively correlated.  An additional year of&#13;
schooling was associated with an increase of 4.75 yuan in monthly earnings, the average&#13;
monthly earnings being 94.40 yuan. Using the elaborate method, it was found that the&#13;
unadjusted internal rate of return was 8.98 percent for primary education and 11.24&#13;
percent for lower-secondary education. These findings show that investment in basic&#13;
education in poor areas in China is quite profitable. Research in other countries has&#13;
shown that education also has important social and political benefits, such as reduction in&#13;
fertility rate, improvement in health, and contribution to national integration. Thus the&#13;
case for investment in basic education in poor areas in China will be even stronger if&#13;
these other less quantifiable benefits are applicable to China.&#13;
Additional Tax Revenue&#13;
11.  In China, the administration and financing of compulsory education (six years of&#13;
primary education plus three years of lower-secondary education) is primarily the&#13;
responsibility of local governments (governments at and below the county level).&#13;
Residents in rural China pay a variety of taxes and levies to the county government,&#13;
including rural education surcharges. Rural education surcharges are an established way&#13;
for financing compulsory education in rural China. They generally amount to one to two&#13;
percent of household income, with the precise surcharge rate determined locally. It is a&#13;
national policy that the total tax/levy should not exceed five percent of household&#13;
income. In addition, the poorest households (those under 400 yuan per capita per year)&#13;
can be exempted from rural taxes and levies. To illustrate the tax impact of compulsory&#13;
education, the following table presents estimates of additional taxes collected by project&#13;
&#13;
&#13;

-118 -                       ANNEX24&#13;
counties at the end of the project in 2002 (as compared with 1995). The calculation&#13;
assumes that: (a) compulsory education increases earned income by 5.0 percent; (b) 20&#13;
percent of residents in the project counties are exempted from rural taxes and levies;&#13;
(c) education surcharges amount to one percent of household income; and (d) total taxes&#13;
and levies amount to three percent of household income. These results show that there&#13;
are tangible benefits to the government in investment in compulsory education in poor&#13;
areas.&#13;

C. EDUCATION AND POVERTY REDUCTION&#13;
12.   Investment in basic education in poor areas is part of the government's overall&#13;
effort to reduce poverty in the country. To promote access to basic education for poor&#13;
families, four sets of strategies or activities have been incorporated in the design of the&#13;
project: targeting project resources at intended population groups, mobilizing additional&#13;
education funds for poor counties, continuing the innovation in student assistance, and&#13;
piloting a textbook rental scheme.&#13;
Targeting of Project Resources&#13;
13.   In order to direct project resources at the intended population groups, this project&#13;
has adopted the same targeting strategies used in the design of the Third Basic Education&#13;
Project. These strategies are: including only nationally-designated and provincially-&#13;
designated poor counties in the project, increasing the involvement of minority&#13;
populations in project activities, promoting girls education in project counties, and&#13;
placing more overall project investment in primary education than in lower-secondary&#13;
education. Throughout project preparation and appraisal, the proposed activities and&#13;
investment costs were carefully examined to encourage these targeting strategies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-119-                      ANNEX24&#13;
Indicators are available to monitor progress in minority and girls education in project&#13;
counties.&#13;
Mobilization of Additional Education Funds for Poor Counties&#13;
14.   Additional funds for compulsory education will be provided by central,&#13;
provincial, and prefecture/city governments to poor counties. These funds are highly&#13;
desirable for at least two reasons: they increase the education resources for poor counties,&#13;
and they contribute to equality in the regional allocation of education resources.&#13;
15.   Central Fund for Compulsory Education in Poor Areas. During the Ninth&#13;
Five-Year Plan period (1996-2000), a categorical fund of 3.9 billion yuan from the&#13;
central government will be used in compulsory education in poor areas. This fund will be&#13;
used in the improvement in school facilities and the provision of equipment, furniture,&#13;
and books. Also, for each of the five years beginning in 1997, an additional 20 million&#13;
yuan will be allocated by the central government for student assistance in poor areas.&#13;
While the precise distribution of the central funds by provinces is not known yet, it is&#13;
expected that some of the project counties and project provinces will receive the central&#13;
fund.&#13;
16.   Additional Education  Funds  from   Provincial  and  Prefecture/City&#13;
Governments. Provincial and prefecture/city governments will provide additional&#13;
education funds to poor counties in two ways: they will match (one-to-one ratio) the&#13;
central fund for compulsory education in poor areas, and they provide the majority of&#13;
counterpart funding (see Section D on counterpart funding for amount) to support project&#13;
activities in the project counties.&#13;
Innovation in Student Assistance&#13;
17.   Household Education Spending Survey. As part of the preparation of this&#13;
project, a survey of households in four project counties was conducted. The survey was&#13;
aimed at ascertaining the amount of household education spending, and assessing the&#13;
economic burden of such spending and its impact on access to basic education for&#13;
children from poor background. Two of the counties are located in Shanxi province and&#13;
the other two in Yunnan province. Information from one hundred households in each&#13;
county was collected by the socioeconomic survey teams of the State Statistics Bureau&#13;
located in the concerned counties. The households were selected based on the sampling&#13;
method used by the State Statistics Bureau in its annual survey of rural households in&#13;
China.&#13;
18.   Analysis of the survey data found that household education spending averaged&#13;
between 13.7 percent and 20.3 percent of household net income. For 22-31 percent of the&#13;
households in the four counties, education spending was a heavy economic burden.&#13;
Among the four counties, Luxi County in Yunnan has the highest percentage of children&#13;
aged 7-15 years not in school. For example, in 1995, 6.3 percent of boys and 20.0&#13;
percent of girls in this age group were not in school in this county; the economic burden&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-120-                       ANNEX24&#13;
of private costs of schooling was the reason indicated by 61 percent of the parents. There&#13;
is a compelling need to reduce the economic burden of household education spending in&#13;
order to encourage school attendance.&#13;
19.   Student Assistance Program. The findings of the household survey lend strong&#13;
support to the student assistance program initiated in the Third Basic Education Project.&#13;
Both SEdC and the Bank Association agree that this innovation in student assistance&#13;
should be continued as a component of the Fourth Basic Education Project. In fact, SEdC&#13;
has requested and obtained additional funding from the Ministry of Finance for&#13;
supporting a student assistance program. Between 1.6-6.2 percent of the counterpart fund&#13;
of the various project provinces will be allocated to this component. The project&#13;
provinces will develop guidelines for: (a) eligibility for assistance (including special&#13;
treatment of poor female and minority students); (b) procedure for applying for assistance&#13;
and evaluation of applications; (c) financing of the student-assistance fund; and&#13;
(d) monitoring and management of the program. It is estimated that, at the primary level,&#13;
the component will cover between 5.2-22.2 percent of the eligible primary students in the&#13;
project counties annually. For all six provinces, the component provides financial&#13;
assistance to 20,357 primary students per year or 11.0 percent of the eligible students.&#13;
20.   The Association has made the following requests to the project provinces:&#13;
(a) using a higher proportion of the interest proceeds from the fund on primary education&#13;
than on lower-secondary education (say a ratio of 7:3); (b) giving higher priority to poor&#13;
female and minority students; (c) using central student-assistance fund as seed money for&#13;
the program; (d) developing a program plan for 1997-2002 (to indicate the coverage of&#13;
poor students over time, and the financing sources); and (e) providing indicators to&#13;
monitor the number of poor female and minority students receiving financial assistance.&#13;
Piloting of a Textbook Rental Scheme&#13;
21.   Cutting the costs of textbooks to parents is one way to reduce the economic&#13;
burden of household education spending. The survey of households in four project&#13;
counties also found overwhelming support by parents for a textbook rental scheme.&#13;
According to a version of this scheme, a parent pays for the full cost of a set of textbooks&#13;
(about 75 yuan per year) at the beginning of the school year. At the end of the school&#13;
year, the parent returns the textbooks to the school for a partial refund (about 45 yuan) or&#13;
credit towards the purchase of textbooks in the next school year. The amount of refund&#13;
or credit will depend on the condition of the returned textbooks. The school will issue the&#13;
returned textbooks to next year's student. A textbook is expected to last for three years.&#13;
The textbook rental scheme actually has three objectives: (a) reducing the cost of&#13;
textbooks to parents and thus the barrier in access to basic schooling; (b) improving&#13;
efficiency in the utilization of a scarce education resource; and (c) promoting students'&#13;
discipline and care of books.&#13;
22.   During visits to schools in Hunan, Heilongjiang, and Hainan, the Association has&#13;
also found support for such a scheme from school principals, teachers, and education&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-121-                         ANNEX24&#13;
officials. However, some education officials have expressed concern about the durability&#13;
of existing textbooks and the desire of some parents to keep textbooks for review&#13;
purposes. SEdC and the Bank Association have agreed that a textbook rental scheme&#13;
needs to be piloted before being considered for wider application. The provincial&#13;
education commission of Shanxi province has agreed to conduct the piloting in this&#13;
project and it will obtain the necessary fumd to support this study.&#13;
D. FINANCIAL ANALYSES&#13;
23.   To ensure that the project is feasible during the implementation years and that&#13;
project effectiveness is sustained after project completion, three types of financial&#13;
analyses have been conducted: financial feasibility analysis, financial sustainability&#13;
analysis, and assessment of the availability of counterpart funding.&#13;
Financial Feasibility Analysis&#13;
24.   Financial feasibility analysis has been conducted at three levels: county level,&#13;
provincial level, and national level.&#13;
25.   County Level. For each project county, the required resources (recurrent and&#13;
capital) for achieving the proposed compulsory education plan during the period 1997-&#13;
2002 were compared with the projected available resources for compulsory education&#13;
during the same period. For project counties in most of the project provinces, required&#13;
resources were found to exceed available resources by relatively small amounts; the gap&#13;
was eliminated by the commitment of additional provincial and central funds. However,&#13;
there was a substantial gap for counties in Guizhou which was subsequently addressed by&#13;
lowering the development goals of compulsory education in those counties.  The&#13;
following table presents the resultant distribution of domestic resources to finance the&#13;
proposed compulsory-education plan in the project counties.&#13;

resources by varying degree across the project provinces. The gap was eliminated by a&#13;
number of measures, including the mobilization of additional resources from government&#13;
and non-government sources, and the lowering of development goals for compulsory&#13;
education in the concerned provinces.  The following table presents the resultant&#13;
distribution of domestic resources to finance the proposed compulsory-education plan in&#13;
the project provinces.&#13;

27.   National level. As part of the preparation of the Third Basic Education Project,&#13;
SEdC informed the Association that it had conducted a financial feasibility analysis for&#13;
the development of compulsory education in all the nationally-designated poverty&#13;
counties during the Ninth Plan Period. The analysis estimated the financial gap in these&#13;
counties. The financial gap will be addressed primarily by additional funds from higher&#13;
levels of government. During the preparation of the Fourth Basic Education Project,&#13;
SEdC indicated to the Association that the central government had already started&#13;
allocating additional central fund for compulsory education in poor counties which would&#13;
total 3.9 billion yuan during the Ninth Plan Period. Also, for each of five years beginning&#13;
in 1997, an additional 20 million yuan will be allocated by the central government for&#13;
student assistance in poor areas.&#13;
Financial Sustainability&#13;
28.   The financial sustainability of the project is assessed by comparing the projected&#13;
total recurrent cost of compulsory education in project counties in 2002 with the&#13;
projected recurrent resources for compulsory education in project counties in 2002. The&#13;
total recurrent cost in 2002 is the sum of the total regular recurrent costs of personnel and&#13;
non-personnel inputs in 2002 and the total annual recurrent cost implication of the&#13;
project. The total annual recurrent cost implication of the project is equal to the sum of&#13;
the annual costs to maintain the effectiveness of project investment in school buildings,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-123 -                        ANNEX24&#13;
equipment, furniture, and technical assistance. In this analysis, the annual cost of&#13;
maintenance of an education input is estimated to be the product of a coefficient for that&#13;
input and the project investment in that input. The coefficient will vary across education&#13;
inputs and across project counties. It is between one and two percent for school&#13;
buildings, between three and four percent for equipment, between one and two percent for&#13;
furniture, and between 0.1 and 0.3 percent for technical assistance. The projected&#13;
recurrent resources were estimated on the basis of the actual recurrent expenditure in&#13;
1995 and a historical growth rate.&#13;
29.   Initial analysis indicated that the project would not be financially sustainable in all&#13;
the project provinces because of a number of reasons, including an underestimation of&#13;
projected recurrent resources (based on conservative growth rates), an overestimation of&#13;
recurrent cost implication, and unrealistic development targets. By properly estimating&#13;
the projected costs and resources and adjusting development targets,  financial&#13;
sustainability was subsequently demonstrated at appraisal, The results are shown in the&#13;
following table.&#13;

Availability of Counterpart Funding&#13;
30.   The analyses of financial feasibility and sustainability have led to some lowering&#13;
of development targets in project provinces (particularly Guizhou) and subsequent&#13;
adjustment in the counterpart ratio. The sources of financing for counterpart funding&#13;
were carefully examined. A positive development in project preparation was that project&#13;
provinces had taken the suggestion of the Association to reduce the burden of counterpart&#13;
funding on project counties. By committing additional fund, governments at the&#13;
provincial and prefecture/city levels will be responsible for the majority of counterpart&#13;
funding; county governments' share ranges from 30-47 percent of the total counterpart&#13;
funding only. This distribution reduces the risk of inadequate counterpart funding from&#13;
county governments. In addition, project counties were advised by the Association to&#13;
raise more counterpart funding during the first year of the project so as to meet the&#13;

E. INTERNAL EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENT&#13;
31.    Throughout project preparation, provincial representatives were encouraged to&#13;
design the project so as to improve the efficiency in the utilization of resources in&#13;
education. This section provides quantitative illustration of the expected improvement in&#13;
internal efficiency due to the project in three areas: reduction in repetition rates, a&#13;
textbook rental scheme, and the utilization of resources in secondary normal schools.&#13;
Simulation in Recurrent Cost Savings by Reducing Repetition Rates&#13;
32.    One of the effects of the project is the reduction in repetition rates of compulsory&#13;
education in project counties. This increase in internal efficiency will result in recurrent&#13;
cost savings, which can be used to expand new enrollment and/or improve education&#13;
quality. This analysis simulates the recurrent cost savings in grade 1.&#13;
33.    Data from  the six provinces in the Education Development in Poor Provinces&#13;
(EDPP) Project shows that, between 1988 and 1995, repetition rate in grade I decreased&#13;
by an average of eight percent per year. This rate of reduction was used to estimate the&#13;
recurrent cost savings in the project counties of the Fourth Basic Education Project; the&#13;
results are given in the following table. It should be noted that the reduction in repetition&#13;
rates in the EDPP Project was due to a combination of factors: quality improvement (such&#13;
as better trained teachers, and provision of instrument materials, etc.) and administrative&#13;
policy (principals were instructed to reduce the number of repeaters). However, no&#13;
information is available on the relative contribution of the two factors. Thus the table&#13;
provides three sets of estimates of the ratio of recurrent cost savings to investment in&#13;

primary education in the project counties, corresponding to three different assumptions&#13;
about the proportion of contribution due to quality improvement. The results pertain to&#13;
grade 1 only; the ratio will be several times larger if recurrent cost savings in grades 2 to&#13;
6 are included.&#13;

Savings in costs of textbooks in project provinces&#13;
34.    A textbook rental scheme will be piloted in Shanxi province during the project. If&#13;
the piloting is successful, the scheme can be applied in other areas in China. This&#13;
analysis illustrates the magnitude of the potential savings in the costs of textbooks if a&#13;
successful textbook rental scheme were implemented in the project provinces in 1996. It&#13;
assumes that there will be a 60 percent reduction in textbook costs per year. The table&#13;
shows that the savings in textbook costs are quite substantial in amount. The savings&#13;
would also amount to 3.30-8.74 percent of education expenditure (budgetary and extra-&#13;
budgetary education funds) in 1996.&#13;

Resource Utilization in Secondary Normal Schools&#13;
35.   As part of the preparation of the project component on secondary normal schools,&#13;
provincial officials were encourage to scrutinize the utilization of personnel and non-&#13;
personnel resources in these schools and provide indicators for monitoring the efficiency&#13;
in resource utilization. As a result of the discussion between the Association and the&#13;
Chinese counterparts, three indicators have been identified and their expected values are&#13;
given in the llLowing table. Note that the ratio of instructional staff to non-instructional&#13;
staff is used to control the number of excessive non-instructional staff in secondary&#13;
normal schools. A larger ratio means that there are more instructional staff relative to&#13;
non-instructional staff.  SEdC's standard norm  for the student to teacher ratio in&#13;
secondary normal schools is around 11. "Laboratory hours of utilization" refers to the&#13;
average number of hours that laboratories in a secondary normal school are actually&#13;
utilized for instructional purposes. A 50 percent utilization rate corresponds to 20 hours&#13;
per week.&#13;

Learning Achievement as Outcome Measure&#13;
36.   Continuing the new development in the Third Basic Education Project, the Fourth&#13;
Basic Education Project will use measures of learning achievements in numeracy and&#13;
basic literacy as indicators of efficiency. It will improve and strengthen the process for&#13;
collecting information on learning achievement and using such information to monitor&#13;
educational quality and efficiency.&#13;
F. SUMMARY OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL ANALYSIS&#13;
37.   In summary, the economic and financial analysis undertaken during project&#13;
preparation and appraisal has: (a) documented the economic effects of investment in&#13;
basic education in poor areas; (b) resulted in the revision of provincial proposals to ensure&#13;
financial feasibility during project implementation and financial sustainability after&#13;
project completion; (c) reduced the burden of counterpart funding on poor counties and&#13;
thus the risk of inadequate counterpart funding during project implementation;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
