BOLIVIA&#13;
NATIONAL LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
INTRODUCTION&#13;
1.          The weak legal, institutional, and technical framework of Bolivia's land&#13;
administration system was identified in the late 1980s and reported in various sector&#13;
studies and Staff Appraisal Reports. Land Administration has also been a regular theme in&#13;
the policy dialogue between the Bolivian Government and IDA. In July 1992, IDA sent a&#13;
mission to analyze the land tenure issues in particular the granting of public land in parcels&#13;
far exceeding the grantee's exploitation capacities. The mission reported on the increasing&#13;
land insecurity in the Eastern Lowlands because of overlapping titles and poor&#13;
performance of the land institutions. An agreement was reached on the need to design a&#13;
comprehensive solution for Bolivia's land administration system.&#13;
2.          In November 1992, Government decided to start clarifying the land tenure&#13;
situation by suspending the operations of the National Commission of Agrarian Reform&#13;
(CNRA) and the National Colonization Institute (INC) which were in charge of land&#13;
reform, titling and land settlements. It introduced a moratorium on the distribution of&#13;
public land and created the Comisi6n de Intervenci6n CNRA-INC (CI), inspecting the&#13;
operations of CNRA and INC and carrying out some of their mandate. CI has started to&#13;
overhaul the entire land legislation, draft legal reforms, work on the backlog of the past&#13;
land titling programs, and design a land settlement policy. A specific request for IDA&#13;
support followed in February 1993. CI's establishment has been largely financed through&#13;
reallocation of proceeds of the Development Credit 21 19-BO. In mid-1993, additional&#13;
funding from the Japanese Trust Fund was approved to finance preparation of the&#13;
proposed project, including implementation of a pilot cadastral project.&#13;
3.          An IDA pre-appraisal mission visited Bolivia in April 1994. It was&#13;
followed by an appraisal mission in July 1994 and a follow-up mission in November 1994.&#13;
Negotiations took place in March 1995.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
1. BACKGROUND&#13;
A. The Macro-Economic Situation&#13;
1.1         Faced with a severe economic crisis in de mid-1980s, Bolivia was one of&#13;
the first countries in Latin America to adopt a far reaching economic program aimed at&#13;
restoring price stability and restructuring the economy. The economic reform program&#13;
combined comprehensive structural reforms with tight monetary policy and a program to&#13;
reduce debt and debt service payments. This has resulted in restoring price stability and&#13;
economic growth-real GDP growth has been an annual four percent in recent years.&#13;
1.2         Bolivia's economy remains fragile. The 1994 fiscal deficit-3.2 percent of&#13;
GDP-was, however, significantly lower than the 1993 deficit. The external position&#13;
remains weak--although the 12-month current account deficit (after official transfers)&#13;
decreased to 5 percent of GDP in 1994. Moreover, Bolivia remains vulnerable to&#13;
exogenous shocks-most importantly changes in external aid and in international&#13;
commodity prices.&#13;
1.3         The modest economic growth achieved in the past five years has not&#13;
significantly reduced poverty levels. Over half of the population remains poor and the&#13;
poverty gap has widened. The modest growth level can in part be explained by a decade-&#13;
long decline in the net accumulation of capital stock. While private investment has&#13;
recovered it remains at a modest level of seven percent of GDP. Public investment has&#13;
been relatively high--about ten percent of GDP--yet to a large extend, resources have been&#13;
poorly allocated and invested inefficiently.&#13;
1.4         The new Government came into power in August 1993 and is committed&#13;
to macroeconomic stability and a set of reforms intended to accelerate growth and reduce&#13;
poverty. The Government has acted aggressively--and so far successfully- to correct the&#13;
fiscal equilibrium which emerged in 1993. The inflation rate has declined from 10 percent&#13;
in 1993 to 8.5 percent at the end of 1994.&#13;
B. The Natural Resources Base&#13;
1.5         Land Area. Bolivia's territory covers 1.1 million km2. It is divided into&#13;
three distinct agro-climatic regions: the highland plateau (Altiplano) in the west, the inter-&#13;
Andean Valleys (some semi-arid, some humnid) in the center, and the flat tropical&#13;
Lowlands in the East. During a census in 1984, 20 percent of the land (22 million ha)&#13;
were identified having an owner. Of those lands, more than nine million ha are forest,&#13;
about 11 million ha are natural grasslands, and two million are cultivated or fallow. Good&#13;
agricultural land is relatively scarce and is found mainly in valley bottoms, lakeshores and&#13;
alluvial plains. Various sources indicate that forests and woodlands comprise roughly 50&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-2 -&#13;
percent of the country's territory, and grasslands another 30 percent. Large areas are&#13;
suitable for livestock raising.&#13;

1.6         Population. Bolivia is a sparsely populated country (6.4 million people or&#13;
6.4 inhabitants per km2). The population has a great cultural diversity that encompasses&#13;
several ethnic groups and languages shaping a society marked by sharp contrasts. The&#13;
country's rural population is concentrated in the Andean regions. With 38 percent of the&#13;
land area, the Highland Plateau and Valleys account for 71 percent of the people&#13;
(Highland Plateau 45 percent, Valleys 26 percent). The Lowlands have extremely low&#13;
population densities. The uneven distribution of the population brings the country's&#13;
natural resources under pressure. Concentration of rural families in the more favorable&#13;
areas of the Highland Plateau and the Valleys has led to overexploitation. As a result,&#13;
vegetative cover has been lost, wind and water erosion has accelerated and soil fertility has&#13;
declined. There are very few remaining forests in those areas, with the exception of the&#13;
humid tropical valleys. By contrast, with a rural population of only half a million people&#13;
and an area of 60 million ha, the Lowlands have considerable agricultural, livestock and&#13;
forestry potential. According to a recently completed land use plan, the Department of&#13;
Santa Cruz alone has some four million ha of good agricultural land, out of which only&#13;
0.6 million ha are cultivated. Several million hectares are available for extensive livestock&#13;
raising.&#13;
1.7         Agriculture. Agriculture comprises a very poor traditional subsector&#13;
located mainly in the Highland Plateau and Valleys and a modem subsector coexisting&#13;
with small-scale traditional farmers located in the tropical Lowlands.&#13;
1.8         Contribution to GDP. In terms of contribution to GDP and employment,&#13;
agriculture is an important sector of the Bolivian economy. In 1992, it accounted for&#13;
20.4 percent of GDP and employed 45 percent of the labor force. Legal agricultural&#13;
exports have fluctuated between US$160 million and US$230 million over the last few&#13;
years, representing between 20 percent and 25 percent of the country's total export&#13;
earnings. The sector has been growing at a modest 1.5 percent in real terms since 1987,&#13;
following the liberalization of the economy in the mid-80s. This modest growth was&#13;
mainly generated by the modem subsector which seized the opportunity presented by the&#13;
stable economy and oriented most of its new investment towards exports. Area expansion&#13;
through land clearing, especially for soybean production in the Lowlands, has been&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 3 -&#13;
especially important during that period. By contrast, the traditional sector did not respond&#13;
as anticipated to favorable price adjustments, because of the lack of growth potential and&#13;
markets, lack of technologies adapted to the extreme climatic conditions and the absence&#13;
of support services, including rural infrastructure and agricultural extension.&#13;
1.9          Traditional agriculture accounts for 65 percent of agriculture's gross value&#13;
of legal production and is concentrated on small farms (usually less than five ha, called&#13;
minifundios). It is practiced under harsh climatic and environmental conditions with&#13;
rudimentary technology and minimal Government support. On the Highland Plateau,&#13;
conditions are especially severe with high risk of crop failures due to drought, hail and&#13;
frost. Maize, potatoes, barley, and quinoa cereals are the most important crops. In the&#13;
Valleys, conditions are more favorable, and intensification is possible with irrigation.&#13;
Overall yields have remained unchanged in the past twenty years and income from crops is&#13;
insufficient to cover basic necessities. Consequently, most rural families have diversified&#13;
into cottage industries, seasonal migration and petty commerce, and have tried to develop&#13;
links to the urban economy. Despite these additional sources of income, traditional&#13;
farmers are amongst the poorest, and have been largely bypassed by the country's&#13;
development and modernization.&#13;
1.10         Modern agriculture comprises medium and large holdings, ranging from 50&#13;
to tens of thousands of ha, geared to the production of export and some import&#13;
substitution crops, cattle and timber. These holdings practice mechanized agriculture,&#13;
extensive livestock raising and/or hold vast extensions of land for future development.&#13;
The main exported commodities are soybeans and timber. In recent years this sector has&#13;
shown considerable dynarism and growth potential.&#13;
1.11         Farm Structure. According to in the 1984 agricultural census, there are&#13;
314,600 farms covering almost 23 million hectares (including livestock pastures). The&#13;
size of about 70 percent of the farms does not exceed five ha. These small farms cover&#13;
only 1.5 percent of the total farm area. At the other end of the spectrum, 1.5 percent of&#13;
the holdings occupy about 70 percent ofthe farm area.'&#13;
1.12         Forest Potential. The Lowlands also boast one of the world's largest&#13;
tropical forest areas (45 million ha). These areas are very rich in biodiversity. For most of&#13;
Bolivia's history, these forests were a distant, inaccessible, and extremely unpopulated&#13;
place. This started changing in the 1950's when improved road links and the development&#13;
of the oil industry in Santa Cruz triggered a process of dramatic changes. The influx of&#13;
physical and human capital that followed led initially to the development of livestock and&#13;
agriculture, and later to the development of an export-led forest industry.&#13;
1.13         Land Tenure. The recent development trends and the prospect of&#13;
improved transportation in the Lowlands has led to significant competition among&#13;
I     However, these data exaggerate somewhat the land concentration since not all thene lands arm&#13;
comparable. Land-use potential and access to inrastmcture should also be taken into account&#13;

different groups who claim rights to the region's land use and ownership. The main actors&#13;
in this struggle are: (a) the logging industry; (b) land title holders; (c) large-and small-&#13;
scale farmers; (d) environmental groups concemed with the protection of forests and&#13;
biodiversity; and (e) indigenous people.&#13;
1.14         Current land distribution among these is characterized as follows:&#13;
(a)   protected areas: Bolivia has nearly ten percent of the country's&#13;
surface area set aside in national parks, wildlife reserves, biological&#13;
reserves, or other categories of protected areas;&#13;
(b)  forest reserves: there are some 29 million ha in forest reserves&#13;
(30 percent of the area) of which 21 million are under timber&#13;
concessions. Many of these properties' boundaries overlap with&#13;
combinations of public and private ownership. For instance: some&#13;
publicly-owned forest land has been granted to individuals by one of&#13;
the titling agencies; several production forest reserves overlap with&#13;
national parks; forest land may be private, but the trees belong to the&#13;
State and may have been granted in logging concession to a third&#13;
party2;&#13;
(c)   agricultural land: cultivated agricultural lands are estimated to be&#13;
about two million ha. Potential agricultural land area is estimated at&#13;
five million ha3. The widespread perception is that almost all this&#13;
2     Of the 21 million ha under concession, it is thought that about 16 million ha are on land&#13;
for which a private title has been given.&#13;

&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
agricultural land is being claimed by the private sector. There appears&#13;
to be few public land available in the Lowlands for future land&#13;
settlements to spontaneous migrants; and&#13;
(d)  indigenous territories: the expansion of economic activity has created&#13;
conflicts over land and forests resources between new settlers, the&#13;
logging industry, and the indigenous population. The latter comprise&#13;
about 40 small groups, widely dispersed across the entire Lowlands,&#13;
totaling about 130,000 people. Until recently, the rights of these&#13;
communities had been largely ignored.&#13;
1.15        Sustainability of the Natural Resources. The rapid growth of&#13;
agricultural, livestock, and forestry activities has raised increasing concerns about natural&#13;
resources degradation, primarily deforestation, extinction of timber species (e.g.,&#13;
mahogany), soil erosion, fertility decline, and loss of biodiversity. The impact of&#13;
agricultural and logging activities on the welfare of the indigenous peoples in the&#13;
Lowlands has also become a source of major concern. Effective demarcation of protected&#13;
areas and indigenous territories, development of land use plans to classify different areas,&#13;
and introduction of environmentally sustainable agricultural practices are today priorities&#13;
to improve overall natural resources management in the region.&#13;
C.   Present Land Administration&#13;
1.16        The present Land Administration includes the following functions:&#13;
(i) titling; (ii) maintenance of a cadastre; (iii) land registration and land information&#13;
management; and (iv) acquisition of land for new settlements.&#13;
Land Titling&#13;
1.17        Titling is the initial granting of land to private owners. In the past, CNRA&#13;
and INC were responsible for land titling. CNRA had jurisdiction over the entire country,&#13;
while INC had jurisdiction over legally defined settlement areas, thereby overlapping with&#13;
CNRA. Lack of coordination between these two agencies and absence of a geographical&#13;
backup of the titling process often gave rise to overlapping titles or proliferation of&#13;
multiple titles to the same parcels. The cadastral agency in Santa Cruz has attempted to&#13;
produce a consolidated map of land ownership based on property descriptions registered&#13;
in the cadastre. The map reveals overlapping claims on some 40 percent of the land. The&#13;
situation on the ground is yet another reality, which has only remote resemblance with the&#13;
legal records.&#13;
1.18        The titling process in Bolivia has been notoriously slow and cumbersome,&#13;
except for people able to find their way through the administrative maze. Titling&#13;
procedures have been highly centralized and conducive to administrative irregularities,&#13;
contained an excessive number of steps, and involved high cost and completion times. On&#13;
average it took CNRA and INC respectively 12 and 7 years to process a land title. This&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-6 -&#13;
state of affairs has been most detrimental to the small beneficiaries of the land reform,&#13;
while very large lots were sometimes titled very quickly. The backlog of the 40-year old&#13;
land reform titling program is only now being cleared.&#13;
1.19        The proliferation and inconsistency in the land titles, and lack of recording&#13;
and updating in the Property Registry are main problems. The consequences are most&#13;
severe in the area of expansion of the Eastern Lowlands, where they are a source of tenure&#13;
insecurity depressing land values, causing a reluctance to invest, encouraging extensive&#13;
land use, and accelerating expansion of the agricultural frontier. In the traditional areas of&#13;
the country, where community organizations are strong, tenure insecurity is less prevalent.&#13;
The cohesiveness and internal organization of these communities means that land holding&#13;
within the community is tightly controlled and limited to recognized members of the&#13;
community. Land disputes are therefore much less frequent than in the Lowlands and are&#13;
resolved through community mechanisms. Hence, local disputes are not the main source&#13;
of insecurity among traditional farmers and their interest in holding reliable titles.&#13;
Traditional farmers perceive the need to set the official records straight.&#13;
Cadastre&#13;
1.20        A cadastre is a complete graphic record (cadastral mosaic) of all parcels in&#13;
a jurisdiction. A distinction has to be made between a fiscal and a legal cadastre. A fiscal&#13;
cadastre surveys and records information describing the geographic dimensions of&#13;
property parcels. The fiscal cadastre is not necessarily very accurate as it records only&#13;
information useful for property assessment. The legal cadastre surveys and records&#13;
information describing the geographic dimensions of property parcels very accurately, as&#13;
well as the nature of the land rights and the holders of those rights.&#13;
1.21        There exists no legal cadastre in Bolivia, but there are fiscal and rural&#13;
cadastres. The urban areas have a fiscal cadastre, administered by the Municipalities under&#13;
the guidance of the National Direction of Urban Cadastre (Direcci6n Nacional de&#13;
Catastro Urbano, DNCU). The Military Geographic Institute (Instituto Geogr4fico&#13;
Militar, IGM), which is in charge of the country's geodetic control network and the&#13;
production of maps. IGM merely registers rural properties and sometimes collects certain&#13;
taxes. In practice however, 16 IGM regional offices have had very few resources to carry&#13;
out this work. Although they have done some mapping of individual parcels, they have&#13;
not created comprehensive, up-to-date records of land parcels in any jurisdiction. As a&#13;
result, no information on the topographic position of the parcels is acquired and they&#13;
cannot be placed accurately on a map. Records of the boundaries of protected areas are&#13;
also inaccurate. Attempts to put all those maps together show overlap and gaps.&#13;
Registry&#13;
1.22        Registration is the process of entering in official records a set of legal&#13;
information which describes the holders of the land rights, the nature and basis of these&#13;
rights, as well as spatial information regarding the area, geographic location, and parcel&#13;
dimensions. The process of registration includes new title registration, but more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 7 -&#13;
importantly it also involves the recording of any transaction that modifies, extinguishes or&#13;
creates tenure rights. Hence, once land records (the legal cadastre) have been created,&#13;
registration is essential for their long term maintenance.&#13;
1.23         The Property Registry (Derechos Reales, DDRR), a dependency of the&#13;
Supreme Court, is responsible for registering urban and rural property. The present&#13;
registry has a rudimentary registration of deeds system in which contracts and documents&#13;
of conveyance are recorded. This inscription in a public office is designed to provide&#13;
security to landholders against third parties by publicizing land transactions. DDRR's&#13;
operation and management, however, has not evolved since its establishment in the&#13;
beginning of the century. Registration is slow and inefficient. Departmental Registry&#13;
offices are independent from each other and report directly to the Supreme Court. The&#13;
Court takes decisions on registry matters in full session.&#13;
1.24       Only a small portion of rural titles issued over the last 40 years have been&#13;
registered. Similarly, land transactions are not systematically registered. Hence, the&#13;
Registry is far from complete. Moreover, registered titles may not correspond to the&#13;
actual delimitation of the property as the linkage with the rural cadastre is very weak, and&#13;
the cadastre itself is unreliable. Reasons for the low percentage of registered titles can be&#13;
attributed to the following: (i) over-centralization of DDRR offices creating accessibility&#13;
problems for small farmers; (ii) lack of appreciation for the security that registration&#13;
provides against third parties; (iii) high costs associated with time spent and fees/taxes that&#13;
have to be paid as part of the registration process; and (iv) absence of a legal cadastre.&#13;
Settlement Programs&#13;
1.25         Settlement efforts go back as far as the early 1950s and were thought to&#13;
serve three purposes: (i) expand agricultural production; (ii) alleviate population&#13;
pressures in the Highland Plateau; and (iii) dilute isolationist tendencies within the Santa&#13;
Cruz region. These objectives have somehow been met, although sometimes at high&#13;
financial costs. After the Government-directed settlement approach failed, INC lost&#13;
support from external funding agencies and was unable to get domestic budget support.&#13;
Consequently, INC adopted a more modest approach towards settlement programs.&#13;
Financially ambitious projects, which characterized the 1970s, were abandoned and&#13;
paternalism was replaced by individual initiative. Later interventions have been in support&#13;
of semi-directed land settlements, with INC responsible for the titling of land, and, funds&#13;
permitting, providing some basic infrastructure. These schemes have had better results.&#13;
Today, however, as the majority of settlement takes place spontaneously, there is little&#13;
control that this process is in accordance with land capabilities and environmental&#13;
concerns.&#13;
&#13;

2.  THE PROPOSED LAND REFORM PROCESS&#13;
A.    Legal Framework&#13;
2.1          Bolivia's current land legal framework is based on the Agrarian Reform&#13;
Law of 1953, which was formulated to support the transfer of large private domains to&#13;
peasants in the traditional agricultural areas of the Highland Plateau and the Valleys. At&#13;
that time, Bolivia had a very skewed land distribution pattern, with four percent of the&#13;
landowners controlling more than 82 percent of the land. CNRA redistributed large&#13;
private properties (latifiadios) in small lots to peasants, and distributed most public land&#13;
(tierrasfiscales) to much larger and fewer beneficiaries. Overall, CNRA's records show&#13;
that it re-allocated some 45 million ha or 40 percent of the country's territory over a forty&#13;
year period.&#13;
2.2          Inadequacy of the Legal Framework The present legal framework is&#13;
inadequate to deal with Bolivia's present agrarian problems and has led to many&#13;
constraints to agricultural growth and natural resources management. The current&#13;
legislation fails to acknowledge the current heterogeneous nature of the land tenure&#13;
structure. Excessive restrictions on land transactions (i.e., sales, tenancy, inheritances,&#13;
subdivisions)--although quite frequently ignored--have led to rigidities in the land market&#13;
and consequent inefficiencies in resources allocation. Free allocation of public lands has&#13;
led to a very uneven land distribution pattem. As a consequence of an arbitrary land&#13;
allocation policy, and in conjunction with grossly inaccurate mapping of the titles issued,&#13;
double titling, superposition of conflicting rights (between farmers, ranchers, indigenous&#13;
peoples, forest reserves, national parks, etc.) has created widespread tenure insecurity in&#13;
the Lowlands. Superposition of conflicting rights has made it increasingly difficult to&#13;
design and implement a sound natural resources management strategy. The reversion4&#13;
provision introduced as a means to enforce the fundamental concept of "working the land"&#13;
as the criteria for establishing property rights, has had the unintended consequence of&#13;
aggravating tenure insecurity in conflict areas. The legislation also fails to recognize the&#13;
role of communal organizations in defining property rights, preserving tenure security, and&#13;
resolving conflicts. The historical rights of indigenous peoples in the Amazonian Basin&#13;
and the Chaco region have not been effectively preserved.&#13;
2.3          Need for Reform of the Land Legislation. There is a consensus in&#13;
Bolivia that the Agrarian Reform Law has outlived its primary purpose of eliminating&#13;
latifundio. Instead, the inadequate institutional set up to carry out the Agrarian Reform&#13;
was ill-used to give away enormous amounts of public lands to individuals. This process&#13;
created incentives for significant land speculation and other distortions in the rural land&#13;
markets. Findings from literature suggest that the productivity differential favoring small&#13;
and medium-sized family farms over large ones tend to increase with differences in size.&#13;
4     Reversion had perverse effects because whoever initiated the process could apply for&#13;
ownership of the same land. Renting out one's plot could be used as reason for claiming&#13;
abandonment by the legitimate owner and for initiating the reversion process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
Hence, a negative relation between farm size and productivity is likely to exist in Bolivia.&#13;
A more equitable land distribution would not only be desirable from a social point of view,&#13;
but that also efficiency gains can be realized by pursuing this goal. Removing distortions&#13;
in rural land markets and creating effective mechanisms (including Government support)&#13;
to facilitate access of small farmers to land are the major challenges for the formulation of&#13;
a new land policy framework underlying the establishment of an improved land&#13;
administration system. In addition, the removal of land insecurity is likely to encourage&#13;
longer- term investment in land and the introduction of more sustainable farming systems.&#13;
B. Government Land Policy&#13;
Political and Institutional Context&#13;
2.4          In view of the problems with CNRA and INC--especially the discretionary&#13;
allocations of very large land areas and administrative irregularities--Government&#13;
suspended their activities in late 1992. The Comisi6n de Intervenci6n (CI), was set up to&#13;
investigate their past practices. At the same time, Government introduced a moratorium&#13;
on the allocation of public land for extensions in excess of 50 ha per beneficiary. In&#13;
March 1993, CI effectively took over some duties and prerogatives of INC and CNRA, as&#13;
a transitional arrangement pending the creation of a new land titling agency.&#13;
2.5          CI's present mandate covers the following: (i) to study the territorial&#13;
planning with respect to land use, the location, size and demarcation of the land areas&#13;
granted, consolidated and adjudicated by the State, the vacant land areas and areas&#13;
reverted to the State; (ii) to identify overlaps in agricultural, settlement and forest zones,&#13;
border conflicts, double titling and de-facto land possession; (iii) to establish irregularities&#13;
and illegalities in land acquisition in general; (iv) to propose laws and regulations to rectify&#13;
inaccurate situations; (v) to reorganize the offices of CNRA and INC; (vi) to provide&#13;
statistics on land allocation and titling since the initiation of the agrarian reform program&#13;
and the creation of INC, specifying its shortcomings; (vii) to continue with the titling of&#13;
ongoing land title requests; and (viii) identify, assess and reserve public lands for&#13;
distribution to small farners. CI has started examining previous grants, and, where&#13;
necessary, has recommended the annulment of titles. It is also reformulating Government&#13;
policy and institutional reforn for the land sector.&#13;
2.6          Bolivia's new Government took office in August 1993 and enacted two&#13;
major laws setting the framework for the reformn of land administration institutions and&#13;
processes. It created a Ministry of Sustainable Development and Environment (Ministerio&#13;
de Desarrollo Sostenible y del Medio Ambiente, MDSMA), responsible for managing the&#13;
reform of land policies and institutions. CI reports to MDSMA. It also introduced the&#13;
Popular Participation Law, which creates 301 Municipalities and expands their jurisdiction&#13;
to include the rural areas. The law specifies that the Municipalities are responsible for the&#13;
administration of the fiscal cadastre.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 10-&#13;
Land Policy&#13;
2.7          To redress the deficiencies of the current legislation and consistent with the&#13;
priorities of the Government, five key principles are likely to guide the creation and&#13;
management of the land institutions and the drafting of new land legislation: (i) tenure&#13;
security for all types of owners; (ii) equity in the access to fiscal lands; (iii) efficiency in&#13;
resources allocation; (iv) sustainability in natural resources management; and&#13;
(v) transparency in land administration. Land distribution policy will be part of a&#13;
comprehensive land use plan integrating various alternative resource uses such as&#13;
protected areas, indigenous territories and forestry concessions.&#13;
Strategy&#13;
2.8          The Government is committed to address the major shortcomings of the&#13;
current legislation by enhancing the present land administration system in anticipation of&#13;
the presentation to Congress of laws which would create a National Land Institute and a&#13;
Legal Cadastral Registry. It would also present to Congress a framework land law, that&#13;
will legislate the new Government policy with regard to property rights and the&#13;
distribution of public land. To this end, it has established a technical working group led by&#13;
CI to discuss key changes, consult with all interested sectors, and present a Government&#13;
proposal to Congress not later than December 1997. The Government has specified&#13;
publicly that the new land legislation will be based on broad popular consultations.&#13;
Proposed Reform of the Land Tenure Legislation&#13;
2.9          Government intends to pass a Land Law which will set the broad principles&#13;
of the new land tenure legislation, to be followed by detailed regulations, and several other&#13;
laws as required. The new laws will involve significant changes on the following aspects:&#13;
(i) less restrictive property rights (i.e., elimination of restrictions on land transactions);&#13;
(ii) a broader definition of the "social function" that owners need to fulfill in order to have&#13;
access to and preserve land property rights; (iii) a clear definition of the different types of&#13;
land owners, including the State, individuals, communities, and indigenous peoples; (iv) an&#13;
elimination of the current causes for reversion and the introduction of less cumbersome&#13;
procedures for reversion and expropriation (with compensation); (v) a re-definition of the&#13;
"peasant homestead" and "small property" protected from repossession and alienability;&#13;
(vi) an outline of the basic goals of the new land distribution and land settlement policy;&#13;
(vii) a definition of the economic incentives that will be used to address the problems of&#13;
mini.fundio and new latifundio; (viii) a definition of the principles that will guide&#13;
cost-recovery for infrastructure; and (ix) new procedures for regularization, land titling,&#13;
and conflict resolution.&#13;
2.10         The Government will continue the title regularization process for the land&#13;
settlements allocated in past years, and titles will be reverted if acquired without&#13;
respecting prevailing laws and regulations. It will use land recovered by such means as a&#13;
matter of priority for distribution to landless small farmers. Conflicts caused by&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 11 -&#13;
overlapping land rights will be resolved through a conciliation process. Where the land&#13;
market fails, the public sector will intervene to facilitate access to land by small farmers.&#13;
Problems of minifundio and new latifundio will be resolved through economic incentives.&#13;
Transfer of State property to the private sector for commercial purposes will be at market&#13;
prices through a transparent process. After title regularization is completed the grounds&#13;
for reversion and expropriation will be redefined and the procedures employed will be&#13;
amended. Keeping a natural forest cover in private lands will not any more be a reason for&#13;
reversion, if such lands contribute to sound forest management or biodiversity protection.&#13;
However, the principle of land reversion would be maintained as a penalty for leaving land&#13;
unproductive. The principle of expropriation (with compensation) by the State will be&#13;
maintained for reason of public interest.&#13;
Proposed Reform of the Institutional Framework&#13;
2.11         Parallel to the legal reforms, the Government decided to develop an&#13;
institutional framework which will enable effective implementation of the principles laid&#13;
down in the new land tenure legislation. The challenge is to define a new land&#13;
administration system which: (i) allocates public land through transparent processes and&#13;
for the benefit of the poor majority; (ii) creates the Rural Legal Cadastre; (iii) provides&#13;
incentives to the public to register their properties, thereby ensuring the maintenance of&#13;
the Legal Cadastre; (iv) enhances inter-institutional coordination including between land&#13;
tenure and land use zoning agencies; (v) takes into account the increased autonomy of&#13;
Municipalities as formulated in the Popular Participation Law; and (vi) effectively&#13;
integrates efforts aimed at designing and implementing Legal Cadastres in both rural and&#13;
urban areas.&#13;
2.12         Following these requirements a proposed structure for an Integrated Land&#13;
Administration System is presented in Figure 1. The pillars of the System would be the&#13;
National Land Institute (Instituto Nacional de Tierras--INTI), the Agrarian Courts and&#13;
the Legal Cadastral Registry (Registro Legal del Catastro-RLC).&#13;
2.13         National Land Institute. A draft law for the creation of INTI has been&#13;
prepared for presentation to Congress in late 1995. If the law passes, INTI would be the&#13;
only State entity in charge of land administration and responsible for: (i) public lands&#13;
administration, land titling, and planning and execution of land settlement programs;&#13;
(ii) resolution of some boundary/title uncertainties and conflicts; and (iii) development of&#13;
norms and policies with respect to the Rural Legal Cadastre.&#13;
2.14         Agrarian Courts. The proposed Agrarian Courts system, which would&#13;
operate independently from INTI, would include the National Agrarian Superior Court&#13;
and the Agrarian Courts at the Departmental level which would rule on land rights and on&#13;
the interpretation of the land legislation. In this way, the President of the Republic would&#13;
no longer have to directly participate in land conflict resolution.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 12 -&#13;
2.15        Legal Cadastral Registry. The establishment of RLC will expand and&#13;
strengthen the functioning of the current Registry. It will guardian all legal information&#13;
(pertaining the names of the holders and the nature of their land rights) and all graphic&#13;
information on the property parcels. The inclusion of a cadastral map as part of the legally&#13;
recorded information will provide an unambiguous identification of each parcel. The map&#13;
will contain information on the parcel only, while the juridical database will contain&#13;
information pertaining to the owner. The connection will be made through the parcel&#13;
number which will be unique for each parcel (unique parcel identifier, or c6digo&#13;
cadastral). Thus the registry information will be referenced to the parcel (not the owner).&#13;
This parcel based registry system leads to a more rational information management, and is&#13;
consistent with trends around the world. The RLC law would govern the implementation&#13;
of these processes.&#13;

2.16        Maintenance of the Registry records would depend upon information on&#13;
land transactions (e.g., subdivisions, transfers) being reported to the Registry. For this&#13;
reason, the RLC Law would render registration compulsory. Also, RLC would be&#13;
decentralized to remove disincentives to Register (inaccessibility, high costs, processing&#13;
delays). To formalize transactions through the registry, RLC would receive the&#13;
information describing the transactions--usually a contract or deed-- and the cadastral&#13;
plan. The deed would be notarized by a private sector notary. The seller will also&#13;
contract the services of a cadastral surveyor if the transaction involves any boundary&#13;
changes. Relying on the private sector for notary and survey services will avoid the build&#13;
up of a large field surveying capacity within RLC.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 13 -&#13;
2.17         It is expected that RLC would be part of the Judicial Power (Supreme&#13;
Court) where the current Registry is located.5 All RLC offices around the country would&#13;
be under the umbrella of a National Direction of the Legal Cadastral Registry (Direcci6n&#13;
Nacional del Registro Legal del Catastro, DNRLC). DNRLC or INTI would set norms&#13;
and policies guiding the registration process of rural, and eventually urban, properties in&#13;
the country.&#13;
2.18         The design of the proposed RLC will have the following advantages:&#13;
(i) the cadastre and registry are in the same office, facilitating consistent maintenance of&#13;
the register; (ii) the registration process is simplified for the user as (s)he only deals with&#13;
one institution; (iii) the registration function is separated from the taxation function, which&#13;
is now the responsibility of the Municipalities, thereby avoiding disincentives to register&#13;
property; (iv) the structure specifically provides for the eventual conversion of urban fiscal&#13;
cadastre to the legal cadastre by designating the RLC as the responsible institution; and&#13;
(v) the RLC structure will be designed to fit the frequency of property transactions, which&#13;
also leads to a better allocation of resources.&#13;
Legal Cadastre and Regularization Process (Cat-San)&#13;
2.19         The legal cadastre and the regularization process will be carried out at the&#13;
same time (Catastro con Saneamiento, Cat-San). Cat-San's objective is to provide a&#13;
reliable, up-to-date, authoritative record of existing tenure rights. CI will carry out a&#13;
review of existing documentation on land rights in an cadastral area as well as fieldwork to&#13;
identify defacto land tenure. The fieldwork will consist of a juridical component (land&#13;
rights) and a technical component (parcel boundaries). Contradictory information&#13;
between the documentation and the field situation will be resolved through a conciliation&#13;
process. To ensure legal value and updating over time, all the information from the legal&#13;
cadastre regularization process will be entered into the Registry at the initiative of the&#13;
Land Institute to be established.&#13;
Land Settlement Program&#13;
2.20         CI (and later INTI) would be the primary planning and executing agency of&#13;
the Government's land settlement policy, aimed at benefiting the poorest sectors of&#13;
Bolivian society and allowing farmers with little or no land in the Andean regions to have&#13;
access to unexploited farm lands. This function involves seven important activities: (i)&#13;
identifying remaining public lands and those subject to reversion; (ii) implementing a&#13;
screening process aimed--among others--at identifying land free of claims, suitable for&#13;
agriculture and livestock, and compatible with environmental criteria; (iii) applying the&#13;
legal procedures for reserving these lands for future land settlements to small farmers; (iv)&#13;
designing and executing technical baseline studies of these lands in order to orient their&#13;
future use by small farmers; (v) identifying potential beneficiaries and allocation of&#13;
5     Unless a law is passed that transfers responsibility for the Registry from the Judiciary to the&#13;
Executive Branch of Government, which is the more usual set up.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 14 -&#13;
individual family plots according to predetermined and environmentally acceptable&#13;
criteria6; (vi) coordinating with various public and private organizations which will provide&#13;
basic services and infrastructure in the new settlement areas; and (vii) evaluating the&#13;
results of ongoing programs.&#13;
Municipalities and Land Administration&#13;
2.21         Municipalities, as defined by the Popular Participation Law, incorporate&#13;
both urban and rural areas. The initiatives to implement fiscal cadastres have been mainly&#13;
for urban areas with input from the Urban Cadastre. Since Municipalities now have&#13;
jurisdiction over rural areas as well, they may expand their tax coverage to include rural&#13;
properties. However, they do not have authority to distribute rural lands. The&#13;
Municipalities which cannot wait for INTI to implement the rural cadastre will be&#13;
encouraged to undertake it themselves. CI will provide guidance and set the minimum&#13;
standards for the municipal cadastre. This will ensure that the cadastre can be easily&#13;
integrated within the RLC system to form a legal cadastre. To obtain information on&#13;
current property owners, Municipalities will need to access DDRR or RLC's information&#13;
base. This can be done on a transaction basis (every registered transaction is immediately&#13;
reported to the Municipality) or periodically.&#13;
Land Use Zoning and Territorial Planning7&#13;
2.22         The land administration system will be developed in parallel with the new&#13;
framework for land use zoning and territorial planning. Land use plans (Plan de Uso de la&#13;
Tierra, PLUT) are to be prepared by each Department, within the norms set by the&#13;
Environment Secretariat within MDSMA. The Regional Development Corporations, in&#13;
charge of planning at department level, are responsible for preparing the PLUTs and for&#13;
administering them through a special unit which is to issue land use certificates. The&#13;
PLUT for Santa Cruz has already been forrnulated (with German assistance in the context&#13;
of Credit 21 19-BO). Land use coupled with land tenure information will be the basis for&#13;
territorial planning (Ordenamiento Territorial, OT). The objective of OT is to integrate&#13;
potential land use and land tenure for the purpose of planning development actions and&#13;
investments throughout the national territory. INTI's land information database will be an&#13;
important input into the process of territorial planning.&#13;
6     The allocation and titling of new family plots would be done by lNTI.&#13;
7      Land Use and Territorial Planning are supported by other donors and do not form part of&#13;
the proposed Project.&#13;

3.    IDA STRATEGY, EXPERIENCE AND ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES&#13;
A. IDA Assistance Strategy&#13;
3.1         As the first stage of structural adjustment has matured in Bolivia, IDA's&#13;
strategy has shifted from economic reforms and social emergency programs to a "second&#13;
generation" set of reforms to address the remaining constraints to growth. The most&#13;
recent Country Assistance Strategy (Report No. P-6095-BO, dated January 5, 1994), and&#13;
presented to the Board on February 8, 1994, defines the main components of the reforms&#13;
which are designed to: (a) unbind the productive and export potential of the country's&#13;
most important natural resources--hydrocarbons and minerals--by providing a legal and&#13;
institutional framework which supports private investment, and by attracting private&#13;
management and capital into these sectors through the capitalization program;&#13;
(b) strengthen essential public institutions which define and enforce policy by&#13;
implementing programs such as civil service, legal/judicial, and land administration&#13;
reforms; (c) alleviate poverty through income enhancing and social projects, including in&#13;
particular improving the coverage and the quality of basic education; and (d) improve the&#13;
management of the country's natural resources and protect the environment, in order to&#13;
maintain growth in the long term and avoid degradation of renewable resources.&#13;
3.2         IDA's objectives for the agricultural sector is to support the Bolivian&#13;
Government in formulating a sectoral strategy, that is consistent with the above overall&#13;
country goals and assists with the implementation of new Government policies of&#13;
sustainable development and popular participation. The challenge of the new sectoral&#13;
strategy is to formulate and implement an integrated approach towards rural development&#13;
which simultaneously seeks to alleviate rural poverty, increase agricultural productivity&#13;
and improve natural resources management by taking into account the opportunities and&#13;
limitations of each of Bolivia's major agro-ecological zones. The two important pillars of&#13;
the IDA sector strategy are: (a) a proposed Rural Institutions and Infrastructure&#13;
Development Project, that supports the direct involvement of the rural people in the&#13;
identification and execution of local investments in support of the rural economy with a&#13;
primary focus in the traditional agricultural areas, but also including the new community&#13;
settlements of the Lowlands; and (b) the proposed National Land Administration Project,&#13;
designed to achieve a more efficient and transparent land administration system, clarify the&#13;
land tenure situation, identify public land suitable for small farmer settlements and promote&#13;
a more sustainable use of the country's land resources. These new operations would&#13;
complement ongoing projects, most notably: the Agricultural Research and Technology&#13;
Transfer Project; the Eastern Lowlands Natural Resources Management and Agricultural&#13;
Production Project, which supports land use zoning for the region; the Agro-Export&#13;
Development Project; and the Environmental Technical Assistance and Biodiversity&#13;
Protection Projects.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-16-&#13;
B. Bank Group Operations&#13;
3.3         Up to December 1994, IBRD and IDA lent to Bolivia a total amount of&#13;
US$1.28 billion of which about 50 percent (US$613.9 million) took place since 1987 and&#13;
95 percent was for investment lending. Of the total lending since 1987 natural resources&#13;
(agriculture, livestock, forestry and environment) took up 14 percent or US$83.3 million,&#13;
balance of payments support under structural adjustment 16 percent, public management&#13;
five percent, infrastructure 38 percent, education and health 18 percent, and industry and&#13;
private sector development nine percent.&#13;
3.4         In the natural resources sector, there are four on-going operations: The&#13;
Eastern Lowlands Natural Resources Management and Agricultural Production Project&#13;
(FY90 - Cr. 2119-BO), Agricultural Technology Development Project (FY91 -&#13;
Cr. 2216-BO), Agricultural Export Development Project (FY92 - Cr. 2322-BO),&#13;
Environment Technical Assistance Project (FY93 - Cr. 2443-BO). Moreover, IDA is also&#13;
managing a GEF-funded Biodiversity Conservation Project.&#13;
C. Rationale for IDA Involvement&#13;
3.5         The Project is fully consistent with three of the broad objectives of the IDA&#13;
strategy presented in the CAS (Report No. P-6095-BO and presented to the Board on&#13;
February 8, 1994): strengthening of essential public institutions, alleviation of poverty, and&#13;
better management of the country's natural resources. The project would strengthen land&#13;
administrations institutions and improve land management. Moreover, it would alleviate&#13;
poverty by providing land to landless peasants. Since 1992, IDA has maintained an intense&#13;
policy dialogue on land tenure and administration with the Government. First, it has&#13;
supported the Government in the suspension of CNRA and INC and in CI's establishment&#13;
as an interim solution. IDA has assisted CI's operations with technical assistance and&#13;
training for policy reform through several financing mechanisms such as re-allocations of&#13;
funds of Cr. 2119-BO and Japanese grant funds. Through IDA support the Government is&#13;
drafting new legislation and carrying out pilot cadastre operations, which will need further&#13;
expansion. The proposed project would improve the current land administration system&#13;
thereby facilitating its transition to a permanent integrated geographical and legal land&#13;
administration system as envisaged by the Government. The project would also prepare&#13;
the land institutions for the implementation of the legal reforms when introduced. Without&#13;
the project, the transitional system is likely to collapse thereby jeopardizing the&#13;
Government's genuine intentions to legally and institutionally reform the system. IDA's&#13;
unique role in contributing to the solution of these politically sensitive land matters makes it&#13;
the Government's ideal partner to strearmline the land administration. The Bank has also&#13;
gained substantial experience in land matters, both at the research and operational level,&#13;
and is, therefore, uniquely placed to assist Bolivia with the complex set of reforms and&#13;
investments which the proposed Project entails.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 17-&#13;
D. Lessons from Experience&#13;
3.6         A recent review of Bank experience with land administration projects&#13;
indicates that in largely agrarian economies, such as Bolivia, land rights are an immensely&#13;
political matter. When a program involves some redistribution rights over land, political&#13;
opposition is likely to be intense unless compensation to those relinquishing those rights is&#13;
considerable. Second, the complexity of the land titling process has often been&#13;
underestimated. Land titling efforts have to commit considerable resources to institutional&#13;
development so there are sufficient technical and human capacities available for efficient&#13;
project implementation. Third, even with adequate capacity, there is no quick-fix to land&#13;
tenure problems. Improvements in this field can only be achieved on a long-term basis.&#13;
These lessons are being incorporated in the design of the project through initial support to&#13;
a first phase project, designed to obtain broad political approval for the reforms,&#13;
strengthen institutional capabilities, and address the pressing needs of conflict areas.&#13;
3.7         A review of experiences with land settlement schemes identified a number&#13;
of important lessons, which have been incorporated in the design of the Project. First, no&#13;
settlement programn can succeed without a clear tenure policy. Technical efficiency and&#13;
economic viability are best served by a program design that promotes individual land&#13;
holding through the issue of freehold titles or other long-term usufruct agreements.&#13;
Second, the size of the holding allocated to settlers is an important factor in attracting&#13;
them and determining agricultural incomes. Outcomes will be more successful if land area&#13;
allocations are in line with educational levels, agricultural skills and experience, the&#13;
available family labor force and those capital assets that allow land to be managed. Third,&#13;
there is massive evidence of success in association with settlement on good soils and in a&#13;
favorable climate. This points out the importance of proper site selection based on land&#13;
use plans. Fourth, excessive paternalism in scheme organization and administration on the&#13;
part of the administering agency and associated personnel should be avoided at all cost. A&#13;
great deal of evidence points to the conclusion that the emergence of strong, self-reliant&#13;
groups among settler communities is a vital ingredient in ensuring the sustainability of&#13;
settlement programs. Fifth, the emphasis that all infrastructure and social services should&#13;
be provided before settlers arrive and must be provided by the state is wrong. Safe water&#13;
supplies should be present when settlers move in, and roads should follow without much&#13;
delay. There appears to be a positive association between extension and agricultural&#13;
success. The provision of credit in general has a poor recovery record, except if strongly&#13;
linked to output marketing.&#13;
E. Environmental Issues&#13;
3.8         Deforestation, soil erosion, water pollution and loss of natural habitat are&#13;
the key environmental problems. Deforestation is estimated at a rate of 50 - 60,000 ha&#13;
annually because of farmer encroachment, road construction, migration and logging. Soil&#13;
erosion, a consequence of deforestation, drought, and overuse of land, affects 30-&#13;
40 percent of the total territory. Water pollution caused by household waste water and&#13;
industrial waste discharge, especially from mines, poses serious health hazards to a wide&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 18 -&#13;
cross-section of the population. Bolivia is also losing its unique flora and fauna resources,&#13;
mainly as a consequence of deforestation, contraband trade, and migration to the&#13;
Lowlands. Indiscriminate land clearing, road construction, poor management of land,&#13;
water and forest resources threaten the sustainability of agriculture, forestry and&#13;
biodiversity. Key constraints to improved environmental management include:&#13;
(i) inadequate policy, legal and regulatory framework for natural resources management;&#13;
(ii) weak institutional structures, along with the absence of clearly defined responsibilities&#13;
for environmental protection and management; and (iii) a lack of technical resources&#13;
management capacity.&#13;
4.    THE PROJECT&#13;
A. Project Objectives and Scope&#13;
4.1         Objectives. The project objectives would be to achieve a more efficient&#13;
and transparent land administration system, clarify the land tenure situation, identify public&#13;
land suitable for small farmer settlements and promote a more sustainable use of the&#13;
country's land resources. To achieve these objectives the project would help the&#13;
Government to formulate land administration and policy reforms, obtain accurate land&#13;
ownership information, carry out land studies, alleviate land conflicts and improve land&#13;
transaction registration.&#13;
4.2          Scope. The project would have a major component improving the land&#13;
administration system within the current framework and a minor component implementing&#13;
the legal and institutional land administration reforms, if and when they are introduced.&#13;
The major component would support the formulation of a sound and coherent land policy&#13;
and legislation, carry out land mapping on three million ha to obtain cadastre information&#13;
and to regularize the land tenure situation wherever possible, identify 500,000 ha suitable&#13;
for small farmer settlement and increase the efficiency and transparency of the land&#13;
administration system. In addition, the project would also finance: (i) title regularization&#13;
and land settlement programs by the National Land Institute, when established; and (ii) the&#13;
introduction of an integrated legal cadastral registry system when the Legal Cadastral&#13;
Registry is established.&#13;
4.3         Land Administration Enhancement would include:&#13;
(a)   Technical Assistance for the Formulation of a New Legal Framework&#13;
and Land Policy. This sub-component would provide: (i) consulting&#13;
services for the formulation of new laws and regulations on land tenure&#13;
policy and administration; (ii) technical assistance, goods and services for a&#13;
consensus building process on the proposed legal reforms; (iii) land policy&#13;
consulting services for the Ministry of Sustainable Development and&#13;
Environment; and (iv) training to judges and other staff of the Agrarian&#13;
Court system (when established).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 19-&#13;
(b)   Land Management Improvement and Cadastre. This sub-component&#13;
would provide the CI with technical assistance, equipment and cadastral&#13;
services and finance its operating costs to clarify and systematize the&#13;
country's land tenure situation by: identifying overlapping land titles on&#13;
three million ha mostly situated in four Departments (Santa Cruz, La Paz,&#13;
Cochabamba and Chuquisaca), continuing the land-titling process for&#13;
small-holders, systematizing land tenure information, and carrying out&#13;
teritorial planning.&#13;
(c)   Identification of Land for Settlement. This sub-component would help&#13;
CI to identify, reserve, and assess the suitability of 500,000 ha of public&#13;
lands available for distribution to small-holders.&#13;
(d)   Strengthening of the Property Registry. This sub-component would&#13;
provide technical assistance and training and finance civil works, equipment&#13;
and incremental operating costs of four Departmental Property Registry&#13;
Offices (DDRR - Derechos Reales) in Santa Cruz, La Paz, Cochabamba&#13;
and Chuquisaca to enhance their registration capacity in the rural areas in&#13;
which CI is operating.&#13;
4.4         Implementation of Legal and Institutional Reforms would include:&#13;
(a)   Strengthening of the National Land Institute (INTI). Upon its&#13;
establishment, the project would strengthen INTI by providing technical&#13;
assistance and financing operating costs to carry out the sub-components&#13;
mentioned below.&#13;
(b)   Title Regularization - Cat-San (Catastro - Saneamiento). This sub-&#13;
component would help INTI to regularize land titles in rural areas&#13;
including, among others, the resolution of conflicts between land holders,&#13;
titling and registration.&#13;
(c)   Land Settlement Program. This sub-component would help INTI to&#13;
provide titles to about 10,000 spontaneous migrant families on areas&#13;
identified by CI under the Land Management Improvement sub-&#13;
component.&#13;
(d)   Strengthening of the Legal Cadastral Registry (RLC). After RLC's&#13;
establishment, this sub-component would support the operations of an&#13;
integrated legal and geographical land registry.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 20 -&#13;
B. Project Description&#13;
L Reform of the Legal Framework (Base cost US$400,000)&#13;
4.5         This sub-component would support the legal technical assistance necessary&#13;
to introduce the policy changes and institutional reforms described in the previous chapter&#13;
and outlayed in the Government's Letter of Land Policy (Annex 1). It would also provide&#13;
land policy consulting services for the Ministry of Sustainable Development and&#13;
Environment.&#13;
4.6         Land Tenure Reform Legislation. The project would fund consulting&#13;
services for the revision of draft laws and regulations on land tenure reform. The laws and&#13;
regulations to be revised and fine-tuned include, among others: the INTI law, the RLC law&#13;
and the Land law. The project would also fund goods and services which would be&#13;
required during the process of national consultations. These goods and services include:&#13;
(i) travel; (ii) organization of seminars, workshops and conferences clarifying the content&#13;
of the Government policies embodied in these laws; and (iii) publicity campaigns. The&#13;
status of these draft laws and regulations, which have already partly been formulated&#13;
during project preparation, is described below (paras. 4.10-14).&#13;
4.7         Land Policy Studies and Seminars. A small advisory group of high-level&#13;
consultants or a Land Policy Analysis Unit (Unidad de Analisis de Polilicas sobre la&#13;
Tierra - UDAPTI) is expected to be established by MDSMA. UDAPTI would:&#13;
(i) conduct analytical studies on land matters (e.g., land tenure, land use, territorial&#13;
planning and natural resources management); (ii) formulate land tenure policy proposals;&#13;
(iii) support and monitor the on-going process of legal and institutional land administration&#13;
reform; and (iv) conduct seminars and workshops aimed at disseminating the results of its&#13;
analytical work among concemed institutions and interest groups in the country. The&#13;
advisory group would be composed of an economist, a lawyer, a natural resources&#13;
specialist, and a land tenure specialist. The project would finance: (i) consultants&#13;
specialized in land tenure issues during one year, including a natural resources specialist;&#13;
(ii) land tenure studies; (iii) seminars; (iv) office equipment; (v) office supplies; and&#13;
(vi) consultant travel costs. Terms of reference of the Unit are presented in Annex 4.&#13;
4.8         IDA has received a draft Land Policy Letter from the Government&#13;
presented in Annex 1. The Letter contains the principles and objectives of the land policy,&#13;
including the Government's intention to: (i) guarantee tenure security; (ii) promote an&#13;
equitable land tenure structure; (iii) introduce a transparent and efficient land&#13;
administration system; and (iv) encourage a more sustainable use of the country's natural&#13;
resources. The Letter describes the changes the Government intends to make in land&#13;
legislation including: (i) the concept of the socioeconomic function of land (for&#13;
agriculture, livestock, sustainable forest management, and biodiversity conservation);&#13;
(ii) the definition of types of rural property; (iii) land distribution policy and the principle&#13;
of free allocation of public lands to small-holders and indigenous communities and to&#13;
others at market prices; (iv) land markets regulation; (v) new forestry legislation; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 21 -&#13;
(vi) the causes and procedures for land reversion and expropriation. The Letter also&#13;
describes the proposed institutional reforms which include the creation of the INTI and&#13;
RLC and their respective roles as well as the role of CI before the establishment of INTI.&#13;
Moreover, the Letter provides: (i) the general guidelines for the title regularization&#13;
process; (ii) the land settlement policy for small farmers and indigenous communities; (iii)&#13;
titling procedures for indigenous lands; (iv) cost recovery principles under the title&#13;
regularization process; and (v) inter-institutional coordination.&#13;
4.9         The content of the above Letter and the timing of the proposed legal&#13;
reforms have been agreed upon during negotiations (para. 8.1). The main agreements&#13;
concemed: (i) CI's role before the establishment of INTI; (ii) the maintenance of the&#13;
moratorium on the distribution of land during the title regularization process; (iii) the role&#13;
of environmental screening in the identification of land for settlements; (iv) details on the&#13;
titling of indigenous lands; (v) the timetable for the presentation of legal reforms to&#13;
Congress; and (vi) criteria to resolve land tenure conflicts in the field ensuring that conflict&#13;
resolution procedures follow equity rules and do not create incentives for deforestation.&#13;
Reception by IDA of the signed final version of the Letter of Land Policy would be a&#13;
condition of project effectiveness (para. 8.3).&#13;
4.10        Law Establishing the National Land Institute (INTI). The draft law is&#13;
at an advanced stage of discussions within Government and with the active participation of&#13;
the stakeholders (peasant and indigenous groups and commercial farmer producer&#13;
organizations). The law is expected to be presented to Congress at the end of 1995&#13;
(Annex 2). The law would create INTI and make it the sole authority to distribute and&#13;
redistribute public lands and to carry out the cadastre and land title regularization in&#13;
accordance with Government policy. The law would establish new institutions for the&#13;
resolution of land disputes (Organo Jurisdiccional Agrario), including conciliation and&#13;
mediation mechanisms. Approval by Congress of this law would allow INTI to complete&#13;
the title regularization process (Cat-San) which would take five years. This period could&#13;
be extended as long as areas remain to be regularized. The process would lead to the&#13;
annulment of illegally acquired titles and the reservation of these lands for land settlement&#13;
to benefit small farmers. The project implementation plan establishes that Government&#13;
would fumish to IDA the draft INTI Law by September 30, 1995 and present it to&#13;
Congress before December 31, 1995.&#13;
4.11        The existing moratorium prohibiting the free allocation of public land for&#13;
other purposes than distribution to small farmers and reservation for indigenous peoples&#13;
and protected areas would not be lifted automatically with the approval of the INTI Law.&#13;
The Government would maintain the moratorium on the distribution of land in excess of&#13;
50 ha per parcel until the land regularization process is completed and areas have been&#13;
declared as "regularized", thereby gradually lifting the moratorium. It has been agreed&#13;
during negotiations that if the moratorium on the distribution of lands would be&#13;
lifted and if the Government decides to distribute public lands other than for small&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 22 -&#13;
agricultural and livestock holdings as defined in the 1953 Agrarian Reform Law8, it&#13;
would distribute such lands through sales in public auction (para. 8.1). New land&#13;
distribution criteria would be defined in the new Land Law. The Government would also&#13;
only distribute lands in accordance with existing land use plans (PLUT).&#13;
4.12         Land Law. The Government intends to start a participatory process of&#13;
discussing changes to the 1953 Agrarian Reform Law. Given the extremely sensitive&#13;
nature of the subject, the process of discussion within Government and with the numerous&#13;
interest groups is expected to be lengthy and its outcome uncertain. The main issues to be&#13;
considered in the new Land Law include: (i) implementing a new land policy taking into&#13;
account efficiency, equity, and sustainability criteria; (ii) clearly defining the types of&#13;
property rights, including those of indigenous people, communal systems and private&#13;
properties; (iii) formulating a new land re-distribution policy; (iv) removing existing&#13;
constraints on private land transactions for all but community lands; (v) creating&#13;
mechanisms for environmental screening of land settlement areas; and (vi) re-defining the&#13;
conditions for reversion of previously distributed land, except for areas not yet&#13;
regularized. The law would also consider introducing cost recovery principles for land&#13;
administration activities and distribution of public lands.&#13;
4.13         The project implementation plan establishes that Government would&#13;
fiurnish a draft Land Law to IDA not later than September 30, 1997 and present it to&#13;
Congress before December 31, 1997. The Mid-Term Review would analyze the progress&#13;
made in the enactment and the implementation of the Land Law, whose principles would&#13;
be in accordance with the content of the Letter of Land Policy.&#13;
4.14         Law of the Legal Cadastral Registry. A draft law has been prepared&#13;
(Annex 3). Refinement and clarification of some articles appears to be necessary.&#13;
Approval of the law would establish a land registry system taking into account the&#13;
geographical dimensions of land titles, integrating cadastre and registry. The law would&#13;
provide legal status to the legal cadastre and registry procedures, and allow regularization&#13;
of the existing property information after Cat-San has taken place. Approval by Congress&#13;
of the Legal Cadastral Registry Laws is expected to take place in 1997. In the meantime,&#13;
DDRR would be strengthened to be prepared to integrate the rural legal cadastre in the&#13;
registry system. The project implementation plan would indicate that the Government&#13;
would furnish a draft Legal Cadastral Registry Law to IDA not later than September 30,&#13;
1996 and present it to Congress before December 31, 1996.&#13;
4.15         Agrarian Court (Organo Jurisdiccional Agrario). The project would&#13;
also finance the training ofjudges and other staff of the Agrarian Court on substantive and&#13;
a     These maximum sizes for small holdings are: Highlands areas: North Zone: - 10 ha,&#13;
Central Zone - 15 ha, South Zone - 35 ha; Valleys: open valleys under irrigation - 3 ha, dry land&#13;
- 12 ha, other - 20 ha; Subtropical Areas: Yungas - 10 ha, Santa Cruz - 50 ha, Chaco - 80 ha;&#13;
Livestock Areas: 500 ha.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 23 -&#13;
procedural aspects related to the resolution of land disputes brought before court.&#13;
Training expenditures (workshops, seminars, courses) are defined in para. 5.13. The&#13;
establishment of the Agrarian Court and institutional arrangements between&#13;
MDSMA and the Agrarian Court, satisfactory to IIDA, would be conditions of&#13;
disbursement of the training expenditures (paras. 5.12 and 8.3).&#13;
IL Land Management Improvement - Cadastre (Base cost US$13.3 million)&#13;
4.16          This sub-component would strengthen the National Intervention (CI) and&#13;
assist CI with the clarification and systematization of the land tenure situation.&#13;
4.17          Strengthening of CI. To increase CI's efficiency to carry out the title&#13;
regularization process and the land identification described below, the project would&#13;
strengthen CI by: (i) providing consulting services in administration, finance, land tenure&#13;
and other fields as IDA may agree; (ii) providing transport and office equipment, as well&#13;
as GIS-based land information systems; (iii) financing civil works for office rehabilitation;&#13;
(iv) providing training in land mapping, office management, land tenure regulations, and&#13;
other relevant subjects; and (v) financing a declining share of its incremental operating&#13;
costs9.&#13;
4.18          Clarification and Systematization of the Land Tenure Situation.&#13;
CI would clarify and put order into the country's land tenure situation by identifying&#13;
overlapping land titles, alleviating land conflicts, continuing the land titling process for&#13;
small-holders, organizing land tenure information, and contributing to territorial planning.&#13;
These activities would considerably improve the management of land resources in Bolivia.&#13;
These activities are also part of the Cat-San title regularization process as described in&#13;
Annex 5, and would be fully integrated into the Cat-San process when INTI gets&#13;
established.&#13;
4.19          To clarify the land tenure situation, CI has prioritized areas (3.7 million ha)&#13;
to be regularized on the basis of the following criteria: (i) frequency of land disputes and&#13;
demand for regularization; (ii) potential for finding available public lands for distribution&#13;
and private lands with good agricultural potential which could be reverted to the public&#13;
domain for re-distribution; (iii) areas with some geodesic and base mapping information;&#13;
and (iv) areas with planned infrastructure projects. A list of priority cadastre areas for&#13;
the first year of project implementation has been agreed upon during negotiations&#13;
(para. 8.1). The selection of other cadastre areas would be part of the yearly&#13;
implementation plans, to be submitted to IDA for review (para. 6.5).&#13;
4.20          After analysis of existing data in the office, CI would contract out the field&#13;
work to a specialized firm. The field work consists of a legal and a technical component.&#13;
9      Incremental operating costs are costs as defined in para 5.13 and include expenditures for&#13;
transport, office rental, office supplies, salaries of incremental staff, contract labor, utilities,&#13;
maintenance of buildings and equipment, field materials, travel costs and field allowances.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 24 -&#13;
Legal members of the team would examine the nature of the existing rights in the parcel,&#13;
the identity of the rights holders, and the basis for the claims to such rights. They would&#13;
record the legal infornation on a cadastral card. Surveying engineers and technicians&#13;
would identify, demarcate and document property boundaries. They would record the&#13;
boundary information in a parcel plan and a cadastral map identified and referenced&#13;
through a unique parcel number. If conflicts arise during field work, CI would start a&#13;
conflict resolution process allowing field work to continue.&#13;
4.21        CI would compare the results of the office and field investigations. It&#13;
would exanmine discrepancies. CI would resolve the conflicts which can be resolved under&#13;
the existing legislation. Resolution of other conflicts would have to wait until the INTI&#13;
Law has been approved. CI would also continue to carry out the legal review of title&#13;
applications and compare them with information collected in the field. The information&#13;
collected by CI would also be used under the Cat-San operations (paras. 4.324.40).&#13;
4.22        To clarify the land tenure situation, CI would carry out aerial photography&#13;
on about 1.5 million ha. Combined with satellite imagery, aerial photography would give&#13;
a clearer picture of the land use and land occupation in the main conflict areas and provide&#13;
the basis for later conflict resolution.&#13;
4.23        Survey methodologies would be based on conventional methods&#13;
(tachometry/electronic distance measurement and the tape) and modem technologies (total&#13;
station and GPS). The pilot project, financed during project preparation, provides&#13;
relevant parameters to specify adequate strategies in using different techniques for the&#13;
cadastre. In anticipation of technological developments in topographic mapping, digital&#13;
cadastral base-maps would be introduced. Wherever necessary, aerial photography would&#13;
be carried out (see above) and a digital cadastral base-map on a scale of 1:20,000 would&#13;
be produced. Additionally, selective ortho-photo maps would be produced. The ortho-&#13;
photo-maps would be used to identify property boundaries which are difficult to access.&#13;
To provide a sustainable institutional framework to maintain mapping activities in the&#13;
future, the Military Geographic Institute (IGM) is expected to be involved.&#13;
4.24        To implement the above program, the project would finance: (i) aerial&#13;
photography and satellite imagery on about 1.5 million ha; (ii) topographical surveys and&#13;
land mapping on an estimated area of 3 million ha; (iii) consulting services in land&#13;
surveying, mapping, and cadastre management; and (iv) a declining share of the&#13;
incremental operating costs as defined under para. 5.13. Upon the establishment of INTI&#13;
to IDA's satisfaction, the Credit would finance the above activities under INTI.&#13;
4.25        The funds available under this project are not sufficient to cover all priority&#13;
areas, which include an estimated 6 million ha. The Government intends to contact other&#13;
financing agencies to finance the complementary cadastre survey work and aerial&#13;
photography. The Nordic Development Fund is one of the prospective financing agencies.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 25 -&#13;
IIL Identification of Land for Settlement (Base cost US$1.4 million)&#13;
4.26         CI would identify, reserve and assess the suitability of 500,000 ha of public&#13;
land to be made available for distribution to small-holders. The land settlement program&#13;
aims at directing spontaneous settlers to areas suitable for agriculture and livestock&#13;
thereby diverting them from environmentally fragile lands. The project would support&#13;
CI's Land Settlement Division (Asentamientos Humanos - AAEH) which would: (i)&#13;
design the main features of the land settlement policy; and (ii) carry out the necessary&#13;
topographical and socioeconomic surveys, as well as soil studies to evaluate and prepare&#13;
these lands for settlement. The identification of land for settlement would include analyses&#13;
of land suitability in accordance with strict technical and environmental criteria, studies in&#13;
selected emigration regions and in potential settlement areas to assess suitability for&#13;
settlement; detailed studies on soil capabilities; infrastructure requirements; and marketing&#13;
constraints. Environmental analyses would determine whether: (i) soils in prospective&#13;
settlement areas are suitable for agriculture; (ii) areas do not include unique ecosystems or&#13;
areas important for biodiversity purposes; and (iii) areas are not located within regions&#13;
claimed by indigenous people. The project would finance: (i) land identification studies&#13;
and surveys; (ii) environmental analyses; and (iii) a declining share of CI's incremental&#13;
operating costs related to these activities as defined under para. 5.13.&#13;
IV. Strengthening of the Property Registry (Base cost US$1.3 million)&#13;
4.27         Organization and operation of the present Property Registry (DDRR) has&#13;
not changed since its establishment at the beginning of the century. Its present&#13;
administration is overly centralized, cannot cope with the increasing workload, and has&#13;
become inefficient. To enhance DDRR's capacity to register titles and land transactions in&#13;
the rural areas, the project would: (i) provide consulting services to improve the&#13;
organization and management of at least four Departmental offices (Santa-Cruz, La Paz,&#13;
Chuquisaca and Cochabamba); (ii) rehabilitate and enlarge offices of the Santa Cruz and&#13;
La Paz offices; (iii) provide office and transport equipment; and (iv) finance training and&#13;
study tours for key staff in land registration, mapping, and organization of a legal cadastre.&#13;
The design of the computer network would take into account possibilities to expand the&#13;
system into an integrated legal and geographical land registration system once the&#13;
Cadastral Registry is established. Upon the establishment of RLC to IDA's satisfaction,&#13;
the Credit would finance the above activities under the RLC component.&#13;
V. Strengthening of INTI (Base cost US$4.4 million)&#13;
4.28         The project would support the establishment of INTI, in accordance with&#13;
an agreed organizational structure (Annex 2) and briefly described here. INTI would take&#13;
over staff, equipment and other assets from CNRA and INC (currently functioning as CI).&#13;
It would have a central office with an Executive Director's Office, supported by a&#13;
Planning and an Intemal Audit Unit, a Legal Counsel, an Information Unit and the&#13;
following four divisions: (i) Geographic Information, in charge of the cadastre; (ii) Tenure&#13;
Regularization and Titling, in charge of titling and conflict resolution; (iii) Land&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 26 -&#13;
Settlements, in charge of land settlement programs; and (iv) Administration and Finance.&#13;
With the aim to decentralize responsibilities, INTI would have one office in each of the&#13;
nine geographic Departments, as well as regional offices on the basis of needs (16 are&#13;
planned). INTI!s Executive Director would report to an Executive Committee, chaired by&#13;
the MDSMA Minister, whose function would be to approve INTI's policy, programs and&#13;
budget.&#13;
4.29        Independently of MNTI, the Government would set up nine departmental&#13;
Agrarian Courts to solve land conflicts and disputes. Conflicts which can not be resolved&#13;
at the Departmental level, would be referred to the Superior Agrarian Court which would&#13;
take a final decision.&#13;
4.30        The INTI law would provide for an external commission (National&#13;
Agrarian Conmmission), with broad participation from all interested sectors (including state&#13;
agencies, peasants and indigenous organizations, commercial farmer organizations, etc.) to&#13;
serve as a forum for consultations on proposed policies and programs. INTI would have a&#13;
total of approximately 250 staff, of which about 150 would be in the field. Only 60&#13;
percent of the staff would occupy permanent positions within INTI, the balance being&#13;
contractual staff and consultants, hired to carry out punctual activities (title inspection,&#13;
regularization and legal cadastre). Apart from the INTI Director, executive staff would be&#13;
hired on a competitive basis. To ensure smooth implementation of the project&#13;
components under INTI, IDA would review the selection of INTI's divisional heads.&#13;
INTI would also study ways to integrate staff into the Civil Service program.&#13;
4.31        The project would finance: (i) consulting services in management,&#13;
accounting, land reform, and other fields as IDA may agree; and (ii) part of the&#13;
incremental operating costs as defined in para. 5.13. Unless otherwise agreed, IDA would&#13;
not finance more than 40 consultants at any one time. The establishment of INTI to&#13;
IDDA's satisfaction would be a condition of disbursement for the above consulting&#13;
services and incremental operating costs (para. 8.3).&#13;
VL Title Regularization - Cat-San (Base cost US$0.6 million)&#13;
4.32        The Cat-San Process (Catastro con Saneamiento). The objectives of this&#13;
component would be to resolve conflicts between land holders and to regularize and&#13;
register land titles. The process would consists of four steps.&#13;
4.33        Promotion of Cat-San. INTI would direct a publicity campaign towards&#13;
land holders in the cadastre area to inform them about Cat-San objectives, its benefits,&#13;
their obligations and the timetable. Wherever possible, local community leaders would be&#13;
involved in this effort.&#13;
4.34        Conflict Resolution. On the basis of a comparison of office and field&#13;
investigation results, INTI would examine discrepancies and decide on the legal character&#13;
of the land claims. Although many problems would be solved in the field, INTI would&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 27 -&#13;
establish rules governing its decision making on the claims. The basic rule is that 1NTI&#13;
would give priority to valid land possession and occupation even if this disagrees with&#13;
written documents. It has been agreed during negotiations that during the title&#13;
regularization process the Government would revert unproductive lands to the&#13;
public domain in accordance with the 1953 Agrarian Reform Law (para. 8.1). Aerial&#13;
photography would be used to establish a benchmark to determine whether lands were&#13;
being used productively or whether they were idle at a certain date. It has been agreed&#13;
during negotiations that detailed conflict resolution rules, in form and substance&#13;
satisfactory to IDA, would be adopted by INTI (para. 8.1). In complex conflict&#13;
situations INTI would start a conciliation process on the basis of the above rules. If&#13;
conflicts can not be resolved, the matter would be brought to the Agrarian Courts which&#13;
would take a final decision.&#13;
4.35         Publication of Field Results. Once all conflicts are resolved, INTI would&#13;
publicize the list of current owners and claimants together with the cadastral map in a&#13;
public office in the most central town of the cadastre area. The objective of this exercise&#13;
is to obtain final input from landowners and claimants as to the veracity of the results.&#13;
4.36        Registration in DDRR/RLC and Issuance of Registry Certificate. The&#13;
process would end with INTI's declaration of a cadastre area (area catastrada) by issuing&#13;
a cadastral certificate to each beneficiary. Registration of the information on rights and&#13;
boundaries into the Registry which is expected to issue Registry Certificates to legitimate&#13;
owners for a fee.&#13;
4.37         To carry out this sub-component, the project would finance consulting&#13;
services and a declining share of the incremental operating costs as specified in para. 5.13.&#13;
The establishment of INTI and its adoption of the conflict resolution rules&#13;
(para. 4.34) in form and substance satisfactory to IDA would be a condition of&#13;
disbursement for the above expenditures (para. 8.3).&#13;
4.38         Cost Recovery. Since commercial farmers stand to benefit most in the&#13;
short run from implementation of the legal cadastre, the issue of cost recovery is&#13;
paramount to meet the project's equity goals and generate public sector revenues. The&#13;
following principles would govern cost recovery: (i) larger land holders are to benefit&#13;
relatively more from the legal cadastre than small farmers and should therefore pay more&#13;
for the service; (ii) maintenance of the legal cadastre should be fully self-supporting and&#13;
sustainable; (iii) as an incentive to registering, cadastre fees should not exceed the payment&#13;
capacity of the beneficiaries; and (iv) partial cost recovery would be sought from the&#13;
Municipalities.&#13;
4.39         The most important cost recovery mechanism would be the one-time fee&#13;
charged to Cat-San beneficiaries. This fee would be collected when the cadastral survey&#13;
certificate is given to the owner at the end of the Cat-San process. This fee would not be&#13;
a land tax but a charge for the cadastral surveying service, the issuance of a certificate, and&#13;
for the increased valuation of the parcel. This one-time fee would be collected by INTI.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 28 -&#13;
Medium and large holdings would have to pay the direct unitary costs of the survey and&#13;
titling costs. The fee would be on a per hectare basis, with an exclusion of the number of&#13;
hectares corresponding to the small property size as defined in the 1953 Agrarian Reform&#13;
Law, and then a declining schedule for different property sizes. The Municipalities would&#13;
also have to contribute to the payment of the fees. The fee schedule for each surveying&#13;
area would be determined separately, taking into account actual surveying costs and the&#13;
expected increase in property values. Moreover, all titling by INTI would require the&#13;
payment of an administrative fee. Finally, INTI would also sell information to the public,&#13;
in the form of maps, published statistics, technical reports resulting from various studies&#13;
and any other information related to land tenure and use.&#13;
4.40        The Government has worked out details of the cost recovery mechanisms,&#13;
which have been discussed during negotiations. It has been agreed during negotiations&#13;
that the Government would charge fees for cadastre surveys and titling services&#13;
performed in respect of medium and corporate agricultural holdings and medium&#13;
and large livestock land holdings as defined in the 1953 Agrarian Reform Law and&#13;
from the Municipalities in which these land holdings are located at a level sufficient&#13;
to cover Cl's and INTI's unitary direct costs for providing the services (para. 8.1).&#13;
The adoption of the agreed cost recovery mechanisms by INTI would be a condition&#13;
of disbursement of INTI expenditures mentioned under para. 4.31 (para. 8.3).&#13;
VIIL Land Settlement Program (Base cost US$0.5 million)&#13;
4.41        The land settlement program aims at directing spontaneous settlers to areas&#13;
suitable for agriculture and livestock. INTI would legally define and physically demarcate&#13;
land for settlement, orient new settlers to those areas and coordinate the design and&#13;
implementation of complementary infrastructure and services with relevant technical and&#13;
funding agencies (e.g., Social Infrastructure Fund and Small-Farmer Development Fund).&#13;
More details are described in Annex 6.&#13;
4.42        The land settlement process would be based on the following principles.&#13;
First, public land allocations through land grants (or sales) would follow existing land use&#13;
plans and, if necessary, supplemental soil suitability studies would be carried out. The&#13;
Land Settlement Manual would specify how soil classification of land use plans would&#13;
relate to the intended use (agriculture, livestock) of land allocations. Second, there would&#13;
be no settlements (or public land sales) in areas occupied by indigenous peoples or those&#13;
areas necessary for their livelihood. Third, allocation of public lands through land grants&#13;
would require an Environmental Impact Assessment to be approved by the National&#13;
Secretariat for Natural Resources of the MDSMA until a Negative List of environmentally&#13;
sensitive areas to be prepared by SNAP has been complete. Fourth, the parcel size would&#13;
depend on the soils, farming system, the cropping pattern, the level of technology and&#13;
marketing possibilities, but would be limited to the size of small properties as defined in&#13;
the 1953 Agrarian Reform Law with a maximum of 50 ha. New limits, based on soil&#13;
studies and land use plans would be incorporated into the new Land Law.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 29 -&#13;
4.43        INTI would select beneficiaries on the basis of agreed criteria, including&#13;
poverty level, land possessions, family size, technical knowledge, etc. Candidates living&#13;
illegally in protected areas would have some preference. INTI would divide the area in&#13;
parcels, coordinate construction of basic infrastructure and provision of basic necessities&#13;
with other agencies and projects, provide the migrants with land titles, and organize (with&#13;
the help of other institutions or NGOs) orientation seminars on agricultural production&#13;
techniques, livestock production, basic health and other pertinent subjects.&#13;
4.44        To implement the above program, the project would finance:&#13;
(i) orientation and training of future colonists in basic agriculture and health in the tropical&#13;
lowlands; (ii) topographical surveys for demarcation and inscription of individual parcels;&#13;
and (iii) part of INTI's incremental operating costs as defined under para. 5.13.&#13;
4.45        AAHH would prepare an internal manual (Land Settlement Manual) which&#13;
would specify: (i) criteria and procedures for the identification of areas suitable for land&#13;
settlements; (ii) environmental safeguards, including the relation between land use&#13;
classification and intended use of land allocations; (iii) criteria for the selection of&#13;
beneficiaries; (iv) the Government's policy regarding land settlements, including methods&#13;
to coordinate assistance to supply settlers with basic infrastructure, health and agricultural&#13;
services; and (v) criteria and mechanisms used to determine basic land allocation units in&#13;
accordance with the principles outlined in para. 4.42. The content of the Land&#13;
Settlement Manual has been agreed upon during negotiations (para. 8.1). Adoption&#13;
by CI of a Land Settlement Manual including environmental screening procedures&#13;
and agreed upon by IDA would be a condition of Credit effectiveness (para. 8.2).&#13;
VIIL Legal Cadastral Registry (Base Cost US$2.3 million)&#13;
4.46        This sub-component would upgrade DDRR from a mere registry of&#13;
property rights to a fully integrated Legal Cadastral Registry. Integrating the cadastral&#13;
information into an improved and modernized version of the current Registry requires the&#13;
introduction of new organization, processes and techniques. A technical cadastre&#13;
department would be added to the Registry to examine all cadastral plans and ensure that&#13;
the geographic information entering RLC conforms with set minimum standards. The&#13;
legal department would continue to examine incoming documents, such as new deeds, and&#13;
address any legal questions that arise in a transaction in the registration process.&#13;
Automation technology would be introduced to link the juridical data base of the current&#13;
Registry with the graphical data base of the cadastre department. The latter would&#13;
computerize the information and maintain the databases that contain the cadastral and&#13;
registry information. This information would be managed by a geographic information&#13;
system (GIS).&#13;
4.47        This sub-component would help to establish RLC's National Directorate in&#13;
Sucre, as well as further improving the four Departmental RLC offices in the Departments&#13;
of Santa-Cruz, La Paz, Chuquisaca and Cochabamba, corresponding to the areas of&#13;
implementation of the legal cadastre. Additional offices may be set up at a more&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 30 -&#13;
decentralized level (e.g., Municipality or province) depending on the frequency of&#13;
transactions and the viability of establishing a permanent decentralized RLC office. In&#13;
order to make RLC's services more accessible to the general public, several local&#13;
collection offices would be identified. The offices of certain notaries and Municipalities&#13;
could serve in this capacity. Periodically the Departmental RLC would collect the deeds&#13;
and cadastral plans deposited with the notaries and Municipalities.&#13;
4.48        The project would fund: (i) the construction of a central office and the&#13;
rehabilitation and enlargement of the Cochabamba and Chuquisaca Departmental offices;&#13;
and (ii) part of RLC's incremental operating costs as defined in para. 5.13. Thereafter, the&#13;
RLC offices would be self-financing, since they would charge a fee for registry certificates.&#13;
The establishment of RLC and the signing of an implementation agreement between&#13;
MDSMA and the Supreme Court, both satisfactory to IDA, would be conditions of&#13;
disbursement of the above expenditures (para. 8.3).&#13;
5.    PROJECT COSTS AND FINANCING&#13;
A. Project Costs&#13;
5.1         The total project cost is estimated at US$27.2 million equivalent, including&#13;
taxes and duties. Base costs are US$24.2 million, and contingencies US$3.0 million. The&#13;
foreign exchange component is US$10.2 million, or 38 percent of project costs. Project&#13;
costs are estimated at November 1994 prices. The breakdown of costs by component is&#13;
shown in Table 4 and by type of expenditures in Table 5. Detailed cost tables are&#13;
presented in Annex 8. Physical contingencies are included at 10 percent of investment&#13;
costs (excluding technical assistance) and at five percent for technical assistance and&#13;
recurrent costs. Price contingencies (averaging seven percent of base costs) were&#13;
calculated on the basis of the following domestic and foreign exchange inflation rates:&#13;

B. Proposed Financing Plan&#13;
5.2         The Project would be financed by and IDA - Credit (US$20.4 million) and&#13;
the Government (US$6.8 million). The Government is also identitying other sources to&#13;
finance complementary activities.&#13;

C. Financial Implications for Government&#13;
5.3         Recurrent Costs. At completion, the project is expected to generate&#13;
annual incremental recurrent costs of about US$2.3 million (1994 prices). A gradual&#13;
build-up of Government contribution towards these costs is included in the financing plan.&#13;
Cost recovery arrangements under the cadastre and land settlement components would&#13;
provide for additional revenues to meet part of this additional obligation of the&#13;
Government from the third project year onwards. It is the objective that in the medium-&#13;
tenn, cost recovery and administrative fees would generate sufficient revenue to cover a&#13;
large share of recurrent costs. The following table shows the Government contribution&#13;
and the estimated taxes and cost recovery revenues during the project period.&#13;

Note: Figures in parentheses are the respective amounts financed by the Credit&#13;
5.5         The project would finance procurement of vehicles and equipment, small&#13;
civil works, cadastre and consultant services, and incremental operating costs. All ICB&#13;
procurement would use IDA standard bidding documents, modified as necessary to meet&#13;
the requirements of the project. All LCB procurement would use standard bidding&#13;
documents to be agreed upon with IDA. Under Bolivian law, publicly funded contracts&#13;
estimated to cost more than 200,000 Bs (US$45,000) must be procured through one of&#13;
three international procurement agents under contract with the Government. Procurement&#13;
under the project would comply with this requirement. The procurement plan is presented&#13;
in Annex 10.&#13;
5.6         Civil Works. Contracts for civil works are expected to range between&#13;
US$10,000 and US$100,000 and are not expected to attract foreign contractors. LCB&#13;
would be applied for all civil works estimated to cost US$25,000 or more up to an&#13;
aggregate amount of US$400,000. Works which can not be packaged and are estimated&#13;
to cost less than US$25,000 per contract and up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$0.3 million would be procured on the basis of comparison of price quotations from at&#13;
least three eligible suppliers.&#13;
5.7         Goods, Vehides and Equipment. Contracts for vehicles, computer and&#13;
equipment estimated to cost above US$150,000 would follow ICB procedures. Goods,&#13;
vehicles and equipment ranging between US$25,000 and US$150,000 up to an aggregate&#13;
amount of US$0.4 million would be procured foliowing LCB procedures acceptable to&#13;
MA. Furniture, training materials, supplies and other minor goods which can not be&#13;
packaged and are estimated to cost below US$25,000 equivalent per contract up to an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 34 -&#13;
aggregate amount of US$0.3 million would be acquired on the basis of comparison of&#13;
price quotations from at least three eligible suppliers.&#13;
5.8         Service Contracts for Cadastre Surveys. Contracts for cadastral&#13;
services, including aerial photography, mapping and surveying services for cadastre&#13;
operations are expected to range between US$5,000 and 4 million. Surveying services are&#13;
mostly assignments of a straightforward technical nature. For the bulk of the cadastre&#13;
services exceeding US$150,000 per contract, a single cadastre works contractor would be&#13;
selected following a two-step ICB procedure. The first step would consist of an&#13;
international invitation to submit technical proposals to undertake cadastre works. The&#13;
proposals would be discussed with the bidders, who would be allowed to make&#13;
adjustments to the technical proposals as a result of these discussions and introduce these&#13;
in the second step. The latter step would consist of inviting those bidders to present&#13;
priced proposals based on revised bidding documents. In addition, smaller survey&#13;
contracts costing more than US$25,000 and less than US$150,000, which can not be&#13;
included in the above single responsibility contract, up to an aggregate amount of&#13;
US$1.2 million would be procured through LCB. Minor contracts of less than US$25,000&#13;
and which can not be packaged because of their scattered and punctual nature and up to&#13;
an aggregate amount of US$1.9 million would be procured on the basis of comparison of&#13;
price quotations of at least three eligible suppliers.&#13;
5.9         Consulting Services. Consultants would be employed to assist CI,&#13;
DDRR, INTI and RLC with project implementation. Contracts would be awarded in&#13;
accordance with the 1981 Bank Guidelines for the Use of Consultants. The Bank's&#13;
standard form of contract would be used for complex, time-based assignments. For minor&#13;
assignments, standard documents would be agreed upon with IDA.&#13;
5.10        Review Procedures. IDA would conduct a prior review of each step in&#13;
the procurement process of the following contracts: (i) all contracts for works, goods,&#13;
and cadastre services exceeding US$150,000; (ii) the first contracts below US$150,000&#13;
for works, goods and cadastre services; (iii) all consulting contracts exceeding&#13;
US$100,000 for firms and US$15,000 for individuals; and (iv) all contracts, regardless of&#13;
the amount, based on single-source or of a sensitive nature related to legal reform and&#13;
environment. The above thresholds would result in a prior review of about 66 percent of&#13;
the total value of contracts financed under the Credit. All other contracts would be&#13;
subject to post-review in the course of supervision and by the auditors.&#13;
E. Disbursement&#13;
5.11        The IDA credit of US$20.4 million would be disbursed over a period of six&#13;
years, beginning in the first quarter of IDA FY96 through the end of the second quarter of&#13;
IDA FY2001. The project completion date would be June 30, 2001 and the closing date&#13;
would be December 31, 2001. The disbursement schedule is presented in Annex 9. The&#13;
disbursement pace is shorter than the historical disbursement profile for Bolivia's&#13;
agricultural projects (which is 7.5 years) as 70 percent of the project would be carried out&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-35 -&#13;
by the private sector under the form of consulting and cadastre services contracts. The&#13;
disbursement pace, however, would also depend on the management capacity of CI,&#13;
DDRR, INTI and RLC and on the amount of preparatory procurement work carried out&#13;
before Credit effectiveness.&#13;

5.12        The establishment of INTI to IDA's satisfaction, and the adoption by&#13;
INTI of: (i) the Land Settlement Manual; (ii) the internal procedures for the&#13;
resolution of land conflicts; and (iii) the Cat-San cost recovery mechanisms&#13;
acceptable to IDA would be a conditions of disbursement of categories 5(b) and&#13;
6(b)-consulting services and incremental operating costs of INTI (para. 8.3). The&#13;
establishment of RLC to IDA's satisfaction and the signature of the RLC&#13;
Implementation Agreement between MDSMA and the Supreme Court (para. 6.4)&#13;
would be conditions of disbursement of categories 1(b) and 6(c)-civil works and&#13;
incremental operating costs of RLC (para. 8.4). The establishment of the Agrarian&#13;
Court and institutional arrangements between MDSMA and the Agrarian Court&#13;
satisfactory to IDA would be conditions of disbursement of category 3(b).&#13;
5.13        Incremental operating costs would include expenditures for transport,&#13;
office rental and supplies, salaries of incremental staff, contract labor, utilities,&#13;
maintenance of buildings and equipment, field materials, travel expenses and field&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 36 -&#13;
allowances. Service contracts include services for aerial photography, land surveys,&#13;
mapping, land demarcation, publicity campaigns and other related services. Training&#13;
includes expenditures for trainers and trainee's fees, rental of conference rooms, per diem&#13;
and transport of trainees and materials required for the training activities.&#13;
5.14        Disbursements would be made on the basis of full documentation for all&#13;
expenditures made under contracts requiring prior review by IDA and amendments to&#13;
contracts raising the value of such contracts above the prior review linits. These&#13;
contracts are: (i) all contracts exceeding US$150,000; (ii) the first contracts below&#13;
US$150,000 for works, goods and cadastral services; (iii) all consulting contracts&#13;
exceeding US$100,000 for firms and US$15,000 for individuals awarded through&#13;
competition; and (iv) all contracts, regardless of the amount, based on single-source or of&#13;
a sensitive nature related to legal reform and environment. Moreover, full documentation&#13;
would be required for disbursement of salaries of incremental staff exceeding US$1,500&#13;
per person-month. For all other expenditures, disbursements would be made against&#13;
Statements of Expenditure (SOE). Supporting documentation would be retained by the&#13;
Project Administration Coordination Unit (UCAP) and would be available for inspection&#13;
during IDA supervision missions and by independent auditors.&#13;

5.15        Special Account. The Borrower would open one project Special Account&#13;
(SA) at the Central Bank of Bolivia. The SA would have an authorized allocation of&#13;
US$1 million and would cover four months of project expenditures. The authorized&#13;
allocation would be limited to US$500,000 until the combined credit withdrawals have&#13;
reached US$3 million. Withdrawals from the SA would be done by the implementing&#13;
agencies under the overall coordination of UCAP, which would co-sign all withdrawals by&#13;
CL, INTI, DDRR and RLC. IDA would replenish the SA as requested on receipt of&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 37 -&#13;
satisfactory evidence that expenditures were eligible for financing from Credit proceeds.&#13;
Whenever possible, withdrawal applications would be aggregated in amounts of not less&#13;
than US$200,000. UCAP would be responsible for preparing withdrawal applications in&#13;
accordance with Bank policies and procedures.&#13;
5.16        Retroactive Financing. Reimbursement of up to US$2 million equivalent&#13;
would be permitted for eligible expenditures made in accordance with procurement&#13;
procedures agreed under the project from January 1, 1995, provided that the Credit is&#13;
signed not later than December 31, 1995. If the Credit is signed at a later date, the initial&#13;
date for eligibility of expenditures for retroactive financing would be modified so that the&#13;
period covered by retroactive financing would be not more than one year. Retroactive&#13;
financing is recommended to ensure availability of consulting services and operating costs&#13;
for institutional strengthening and timely procurement of equipment and services.&#13;
F.    Auditing and Accounts&#13;
5.17        CI, DDRR, INTI and RLC would maintain separate accounts for project&#13;
expenditures. The agencies would hire independent auditors satisfactory to IDA to carry&#13;
out an annual audit of these accounts. The auditor's report would include the audit of the&#13;
financial statements, the Special Account and SOEs. In addition the auditors would&#13;
prepare a (long form) report on the management of the project. Copies of the audited&#13;
statements would be sent to IDA within four months after the end of the fiscal year. With&#13;
respect to SOEs, the auditor's reports would include an opinion (and comments and&#13;
recommendations, as necessary) on the methods employed in compiling the SOEs, their&#13;
accuracy, the relevance of supporting documents, their eligibility for financing under the&#13;
terms of the Credit agreement, the standards of record keeping and internal controls&#13;
related to the foregoing. Auditing and accounting arrangements have been agreed&#13;
upon during negotiations (para. 8.1).&#13;
6.  PROJECT MANAGEMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION&#13;
A.   Management&#13;
6.1         Project Management. Overall responsibility for project planning and&#13;
implementation would be vested in the Ministry of Sustainable Development and&#13;
Environment. CI and later INTI would be responsible for the day-to-day project&#13;
management and for the implementation of all project components, except: (i) the Land&#13;
Policy Analysis Unit operating directly under the Minister of Sustainable Development and&#13;
Environment; and (ii) DDRR and RLC's institutional strengthening components&#13;
implemented under the Supreme Court.&#13;
6.2         Although CI has already successfully managed IDA and Japanese Grant&#13;
funds, the implementing agencies' management capacity needs considerable strengthening.&#13;
To ensure smooth project implementation, CI and later INTl would employ an&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 38 -&#13;
administrative officer (with experience in procurement) and a financial controller&#13;
(consultants) to form a Project Administrative Coordination Unit (UCAP) and manage&#13;
project procurement, disbursement, and reporting. UCAP would work under the overall&#13;
responsibility of CI (and INTI when established).&#13;
6.3         Cadastre and Cat-San Management. The land tenure clarification, title&#13;
regularization and management of Cat-San on a total of three million ha involves complex&#13;
technical operations. For this reason, CI and later INTI would employ specialists in land&#13;
registration and cadastre systems to manage this component under the overall direction of&#13;
CI's Geographic Information Department and in close cooperation with DDRR and RLC.&#13;
Terms of Reference of these consultants are in Annex 11. DDRR and/or RLC would&#13;
detach some of its staff to CI and MI in order to: (i) learn about GIS and cadastre&#13;
operations; (ii) avoid duplication of work at the moment the parcels would be registered;&#13;
and (iii) give legal endorsement of the cadastre and registry work carried out by CI and&#13;
INTI under this component. The cadastral survey and mapping work would be&#13;
subcontracted to a private sector company under a single responsibility contract. This&#13;
company would sub-contract survey services and aerial photography out to other private&#13;
companies.&#13;
6.4         DDRR and RLC Management. CI and the Supreme Court would agree&#13;
on procurement and disbursement procedures for the DDRR and RLC components and&#13;
meet twice per year to solve implementation problems. The Supreme Court would&#13;
appoint a project coordinator in DDRR and RLC to manage the implementation of the&#13;
DDRR and RLC components. Assisted by UCAP, DDRR and RLC would carry out their&#13;
own procurement and financial management. Project management arrangements between&#13;
MDSMA and the Supreme Court would be contained in an agreement. The agreement&#13;
would also comprise arrangements concerning the management of the Special Account,&#13;
procurement relations with UCAP, training of DDRR staff at CI and INTI, the&#13;
appointment of a project coordinator at DDRR and RLC and the terms of reference and&#13;
prerogatives of such coordinator, as well as technical arrangements for the transfer and&#13;
management of data from CI and INTI to DDRR or RLC. 1DA has received a draft&#13;
agreement between MDSMA and the Supreme Court on project management&#13;
arrangements and has provided comments on the agreement. Reception by IDA of a&#13;
final agreement signed between MDSMA and the Supreme Court on project&#13;
management arrangements would be condition of project effectiveness (para. 8.2).&#13;
Reception by IDA of a similar agreement for the management of the RLC&#13;
component (when established) would be a condition of disbursement of&#13;
disbursement categories l(b) and 6(c) (para. 8.3).&#13;

B. Project Implementation&#13;
6.5          Implementation Plan. The overall project implementation plan including&#13;
a detailed first year implementation plan has been agreed upon during negotiations and is&#13;
presented in Annex 10. Although the project period is six years, the Government intends&#13;
to implement the project activities over a period of four years. CI would carry out several&#13;
up-front actions including: (i) preparation of legal reforms; (ii) recruitment of&#13;
management consultants; (iii) procurement of GIS; (iv) design studies and preparation of&#13;
bid documents for civil works and service contracts; and (v) identification of Cat-San&#13;
areas and zones for land settlement. Every year, the implementing agencies would agree&#13;
with IDA on a detailed implementation plan for the following year. The yearly&#13;
implementation plans would include a yearly project implementation schedule, selection of&#13;
cadastre areas, and monitorable targets as well as a procurement plan for civil works,&#13;
equipment, and consultants to be recruited. During negotiations, agreement has been&#13;
reached that the project would be carried out in accordance with the project&#13;
implementation plan (including a detailed first year implementation plan) in&#13;
Annex 10, annual revisions to the plan would be prepared by the implementing&#13;
agencies, and submitted to IDA for review (para. 8.1).&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 40 -&#13;
6.6         Implementation Manual. CI would prepare a detailed project&#13;
implementation manual. This manual would contain: a project implementation schedule,&#13;
the detailed terms of reference of the consultants to be recruited under the project, a&#13;
training plan, internal procedures for procurement of civil works, goods and for&#13;
recruitment of consultants, sample consulting contracts, disbursement procedures, key&#13;
monitoring indicators and sample bidding documents. The manual would be reviewed by&#13;
IDA. The preparation of the implementation manual before July 31, 1995 and its&#13;
prompt adoption by CI have been agreed upon during negotiations (para. 8.1).&#13;
C.   Project Monitoring and Supervision&#13;
6.7         Progress on land administration reform would be monitored by the Ministry&#13;
of Sustainable Development and Environment. Progress on project implementation would&#13;
be monitored by CI and INTI's Planning and Internal Audit Unit. IDA and the&#13;
Government would monitor the project's progress during joint supervision missions, a&#13;
first-year implementation review, a Mid-Term Review and an Implementation Completion&#13;
Review. The Government would also organize a project launching workshop upon&#13;
project effectiveness. Project monitoring and supervision arrangements have been&#13;
agreed upon during negotiations (para. 8.1).&#13;
Project Monitoring&#13;
6.8         The MDSMA Land Policy Analysis Unit would monitor the overall&#13;
progress of the land reform component and provide six-monthly reports to the Minister&#13;
and IDA. The reports would contain information on the implementation of the new land,&#13;
cadastre and registry legislation, their impact on the land tenure situation in the field,&#13;
problems which need the attention of the Ministry and/or IDA, and other important&#13;
matters.&#13;
6.9         CI and INTI's Planning and Internal Audit Unit would set up a monitoring&#13;
unit which would be responsible for following up detailed project and program progress.&#13;
A specialist has been hired to develop a monitoring system prior to project start-up. CI&#13;
and INTI would also prepare six-monthly reports on project implementation. These&#13;
reports would be furnished to IDA no later than two months after the completion of each&#13;
semester. A list of key monitoring indicators is presented in Annex 10.&#13;
Project Launching Workshop&#13;
6.10        Upon project effectiveness, the Government would organize a project&#13;
launching workshop to which all project stakeholders in the project (including&#13;
representatives of rural organizations and indigenous groups) would be invited. The&#13;
workshop would explain and discuss: (i) the overall project concept and content;&#13;
(ii) project organization and implementation; (iii) procurement and disbursement aspects;&#13;
(iv) audit requirements; (v) project supervision and reviews; (vi) communications with&#13;
IDA; and (vii) other subjects of particular relevance.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 41 -&#13;
Project Supervision&#13;
6.11        Regular Supervision. Twice a year, the Government and IDA would&#13;
organize joint project supervision missions. Project supervision would essentially provide&#13;
implementation assistance. Before each mission, the Government and IDA would agree&#13;
on the major subjects to be supervised, which would always include an evaluation of the&#13;
project's progress based on the monitoring indicators, compliance with legal covenants,&#13;
and procurement and financial management supervision. At the end of each mission, the&#13;
Government and IDA would write an Aide Memoire which would contain the major&#13;
agreements reached during the mission.&#13;
6.12        Yearly Implementation Review. By November 30 of each year, the&#13;
Govemment and IDA would carry out a review of the project's implementation. This&#13;
review would mainly focus on the legal reform, institutional strengthening and land&#13;
mapping components. It would also focus on procurement progress and thoroughly&#13;
review the project management compliance with the procurement and financial covenants&#13;
of the Credit Agreement.&#13;
6.13        Mid-Term Review (MTR). Not later than 30 months after the&#13;
effectiveness date, the Government and IDA will carry out a MTR. Three months before&#13;
such review would take place, Government and IDA would agree on detailed terms of&#13;
reference and staffing of the MTR team. In particular, the MTR would analyze:&#13;
(i) overall project progress; (ii) implementation of the approved legislation, including the&#13;
public land distribution and land reversion aspects of the proposed land law; (iii) progress,&#13;
cost efficiency and impact of the project on the land tenure situation: (iv) the&#13;
implementation of the cost recovery mechanisms; (v) progress of the land settlements,&#13;
their cost efficiency and field impact; (vi) progress on institutional strengthening and the&#13;
increasing financing by the Government of the implementing agencies' operating costs;&#13;
(vii) procurement, disbursement and financial aspects; and (viii) effectiveness of the agreed&#13;
environmental safeguards. The Mid-Term Review arrangements have been agreed&#13;
upon during negotiations (para. 8.1).&#13;
6.14        Implementation Completion Report (ICR). At the latest six months&#13;
after project completion, the Government and IDA would carry out a joint project&#13;
completion review and produce an Implementation Review Report. This review would be&#13;
carried out by a team composed of project staf, IDA-representatives and independent&#13;
specialists. The review would also include a plan in such scope and detail as IDA would&#13;
reasonably request for the future operation of the project. IDA and Government would&#13;
discuss the plan after which the Government would implement the said with due diligence&#13;
and efficiency and in accordance with appropriate practices, take into account IDA's&#13;
comments.&#13;

7. PROJECT BENEFITS, RISKS, AND IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT,&#13;
WOMEN AND POVERTY&#13;
A.   Project Benefits&#13;
7.1         In the long term, a more efficient and reliable land administration and a&#13;
legal framework more consistent with economic and social realities would benefit all&#13;
stakeholders in land matters. Main benefits would be an increased knowledge of the land&#13;
tenure situation leading to an improved capacity to administer property rights and enforce&#13;
land use regulations, more land security providing incentives for the sustainable use of the&#13;
country's land resources, and improved title registration generating additional revenues for&#13;
the judicial system and enabling a more effective land tax collection by the Municipalities.&#13;
In addition, the proposed legal reforms, if implemented, may reduce distortions in the&#13;
allocation of the country's natural resources, reduce the unequal distribution of land&#13;
ownership among the country's population, and alleviate poverty of the landless poor.&#13;
Indigenous groups would also benefit from the legal recognition of their rights over well-&#13;
defined territories.&#13;
7.2         In the short term, reform of the existing land administration would benefit&#13;
most the commercial farmers of the Lowlands, for whom more security of land tenure and,&#13;
when the land law is enacted, less rigidities in the land market would translate into higher&#13;
rates of investment and growth. This group would be the target of the project cost&#13;
recovery efforts. A second group which stands to benefit most from the project are land-&#13;
poor, spontaneous migrants in search of economic opportunities in the Lowlands. These&#13;
would be the beneficiaries of the land settlements. Also, the envisaged legalization of&#13;
renting land and sharecropping in the new Land Law would improve the land security&#13;
situation for tenants. At the same time such legalization is likely to increase the supply of&#13;
land available for rent or sharecropping arrangements, thereby further increasing&#13;
employment and improving the access of landless farmers to land.&#13;
7.3         Although benefits are extremely difficult to estimate in quantitative terms,&#13;
the project is likely to generate a range of effects which can be classified according to&#13;
three categories: more efficient allocation, more equitable distribution, and more&#13;
sustainable use of Bolivia's natural resources. These likely effects are presented in&#13;
Table 10 and assume that the legal reforms will be implemented as scheduled.&#13;

1.    Land prices would better reflect the real value    V                    V&#13;
of land, because of better functioning of land&#13;
markets, encouraging farmers to make&#13;
investments and maintaining land quality.&#13;
2.    Issuing more secure titles would facilitate&#13;
provision of collateral for credit.&#13;
3.    Better secured titles would increase farmers'&#13;
planning horizon and make sustainable&#13;
agricultural technologies more attractive.&#13;
4.     Simple titling and registration procedures&#13;
would lower farmers' transaction costs.&#13;
5.    INTrs role in demarcating protected areas etc.                          I&#13;
would prevent migrant encroachment.&#13;
6.    Land-use plans to direct land settlements      I                        I&#13;
would reduce deforestation in areas unsuitable&#13;
for agriculture. This would slow down the&#13;
movement of the agricultural frontier and&#13;
lower the risk related to land clearing activities.&#13;
7.    Title clarification would revert to the State&#13;
properties donated illegally or not according to&#13;
procedures.&#13;
8.    Land settlements would improve small farmers'  /           1&#13;
access to land.&#13;
9.     The advice to and training of settlers to comply                       I&#13;
to land use regulations would provide a&#13;
guarantee for sustainable natural resources&#13;
management.&#13;
B. Risks&#13;
7.4           The Project has three major risks. First, given the extreme sensitivity of&#13;
land matters in Bolivia, the timing and content of the proposed legislative changes in&#13;
support of the refonn is largely unpredictable since they have to go through a&#13;
Congressional legislative process. Although the Government is firmly committed to create&#13;
INTI and RLC, there is a risk that Congress may not approve legislation to establish both&#13;
institutions during the project period. However, about 70 percent of the project objectives&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-44 -&#13;
can be reached within the present institutional framework. To mitigate the project risks&#13;
involved in legal reform delays, disbursement of funds for the land title regularization and&#13;
the introduction of a legal cadastral registry would depend on the establishment of INTI&#13;
and RLC, respectively. If these institutions would not be established by the end of the&#13;
project, the Credit amount allocated for these components (US$3.7 million equivalent)&#13;
would be canceled.&#13;
7.5         Second, land reversion and distribution of reverted land to small fanners&#13;
would be a very risky element of the project as it requires considerable political courage to&#13;
enforce reversion. This risk would be reduced by the project's support for national&#13;
consensus building measures from the initial draft of the laws through to their approval.&#13;
Such consensus would make it easier for INTI to implement reversion decisions made by&#13;
the Agrarian Courts. Moreover, the Mid-Term Review would focus on the&#13;
implementation of the land tenure policy as defined in the Government's Letter of Land&#13;
Policy and the Government's willingness and capabilities to resolve the land conflicts in&#13;
the agreed upon and transparent manner.&#13;
7.6         Third, the implementing institutions have a weak management and&#13;
implementation capacity so that there could be substantial delays in project execution.&#13;
The project design intends to mitigate those risks by strengthening the implementing&#13;
agencies' management capacity, involving the private sector to carry out the cadastre&#13;
studies, and through intensive supervision and up-front procurement actions.&#13;
C. Environmental Aspects&#13;
7.7         The environmental impact of this project is described in detail in Annex 7&#13;
and can be summarized as follows. Most components of the proposed project are either&#13;
benign or clearly beneficial from an environmental standpoint. Increased land tenure&#13;
security for many farmers and other landholders would be environmentally beneficial,&#13;
because persons with secure land tenure rights are more inclined to use land-conserving&#13;
practices. The components requiring special environmental attention is the land settlement&#13;
program. Environment Category: B.&#13;
7.8         Land settlement in the tropics is controversial because of the deforestation&#13;
and related environmental and social problems which often result. However, the land&#13;
settlements program is not expected to increase deforestation pressures, nor does it seek&#13;
to accelerate migration to the Lowlands. Presently, new migrants often settle on lands&#13;
which are ecologically fragile and poorly suited for agriculture (particularly in the steep&#13;
Andean foothills). Some settlement zones are legally protected areas which lack&#13;
demarcation or effective enforcement. Some migrants are squatters on privately-owned&#13;
land, where they lack tenure security and have no incentive to invest in good land&#13;
management. The land settlement component is intended to channel some of this ongoing&#13;
colonization pressure away from the more environmentally sensitive lands and towards&#13;
lands of good agricultural potential with secure tenure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 45 -&#13;
Environmental Safeguards&#13;
7.9         To help ensure that the net environmental effects of the project would be&#13;
positive, the following environmental safeguards have been agreed upon during&#13;
negotiations (para. 8.1).&#13;
7.10        Environmental Screening of Land Settlements. Prior to allocating any&#13;
public lands for grants CI and later INTI would carry out an environmental screening&#13;
process to ensure that: (i) the lands are well-suited for agricultural development--which&#13;
would be determined in accordance with the soil classifications used in the land use plans&#13;
(PLUT) and, if necessary, determined by additional soil studies; (ii) the lands are not&#13;
claimed by indigenous peoples, nor necessary for maintaining their traditional livelihoods;&#13;
(iii) the lands are not needed to fill important ecological gaps in the National Protected&#13;
Areas System; (iv) no land parcel would be allocated for land settlements within the buffer&#13;
zones of any official protected area--and if no official buffer zone exists, within five km&#13;
from the border of the protected area; and (v) in the case of Santa Cruz Department,&#13;
lands would not lie within the zones designated as "Forest", "Existing Protection", or&#13;
"Proposed Protection" under the official Land Use Plan (PLUT). In the future, if other&#13;
land use plans are approved by other departments and/or at the national level, INTI would&#13;
also ensure that its land settlements (and sales) are fully consistent with those plans.&#13;
7.11        Selection of Settlers. In the selection of potential settlers for the land&#13;
settlement programn, NTl would give special consideration to persons who currently live&#13;
within "zones of environmental conflict". This approach is expected to enhance further&#13;
the environmental benefits of this project, by reducing existing human pressures within&#13;
environmentally sensitive areas.&#13;
7.12        Land Parcel Size. To promote more efficient land use, the basic unit of&#13;
land allocation in the land settlement program would be determined through technical&#13;
criteria based on the following objectives: (i) to ensure that every participating family has&#13;
enough land to build up a future for one generation; (ii) to maximize the number of&#13;
beneficiary families on the lands available for distribution; and (iui) to minimize the land&#13;
area deforested per family. The land settlement program would not distribute land in&#13;
parcels exceeding the maximum area of the small properties as defined in the Agrarian&#13;
Reform Law. New limits, based on soil suitability studies and land use plans would be&#13;
incorporated into the new Land Law.&#13;
7.13        Avoiding Perverse Incentives for Deforestation. The new Land Law&#13;
would state clearly that deforestation is neither necessary nor sufficient for obtaining new&#13;
land titles, nor for protecting existing, legally valid titles. INTI would avoid rewarding&#13;
new or recent deforestation in its land titling policies and procedures by establishing a&#13;
benchmark of land use through aerial photography.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 46 -&#13;
7.14        Land Policy Analysis Unit. The group of MDSMA advisors on land&#13;
policy would have at least one natural resources management specialist (such as a&#13;
biologist, ecologist, or forest specialist).&#13;
D. Gender Impact&#13;
7.15        In Bolivia, man and women above 18 years old have equal legal rights to&#13;
land. Tradition, however, often prevents women from exercising rights. In indigenous&#13;
rural communities, women face a wide range of inequalities. Despite their predominant&#13;
role in the family's economic activities, women do not participate in the management of&#13;
their communities. Married women are mostly denied access to land ownership. Often&#13;
only the sons are heirs of the major family assets such as land and livestock whereas the&#13;
daughters inherit little.&#13;
7.16        Under the project, women would benefit in an equal manner as men from&#13;
the land regularization and land settlement program. Where land would be allocated to a&#13;
family, INTI can, at present, do very little to ensure that women exercise their land rights.&#13;
During negotiations agreement has been reached that CI and INTI's equal&#13;
treatment of both genders in land allocation and explicit provisions related to&#13;
women's right to land would be included in the Land Settlement Manual and in&#13;
publicity campaigns of Cat-San (para. 8.1). In parallel land policy discussions with the&#13;
Government, IDA will examine how clauses could be introduced in the Land Law to make&#13;
women's rights to land more explicit.&#13;
E. Poverty Alleviation&#13;
7.17        Bolivia's poorest of the poor live in the Andean regions. Their possibilities&#13;
for survival are limited by the harsh climate and the poor land resources. Facilitating their&#13;
emigration to fertile agricultural lands instead of fragile lands is an important option to&#13;
improve their livelihood.&#13;
7.18        The project would contribute to poverty alleviation by: (i) providing&#13;
agricultural land and land titles to approximately 10,000 poor spontaneous migrant&#13;
families; (ii) providing land security to the poor and the indigenous people; and&#13;
(iii) stimulating employment by creating flexible land markets and by providing secure&#13;
titles to be used as collateral for agricultural credit. The project would also help to&#13;
coordinate technical and basic infrastructure assistance to poor migrants provided by other&#13;
agencies to settlers.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;

8.2         The following would be conditions of effectiveness:&#13;
(a)   reception by IDA of the signed version of the Letter of Land Policy&#13;
(para. 4.9);&#13;
(b)   adoption by CI of a Land Settlement Manual including environmental&#13;
screening procedures acceptable to IDA and stipulating the equal treatment&#13;
of both genders in land allocation (paras. 4.45 and 7.16); and&#13;
(c)   reception by IDA of a signed agreement between MDSMA and the&#13;
Supreme Court on project management arrangements (para. 6.4).&#13;

ANNEX 1&#13;
BOLIVIA&#13;
NATIONAL LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
Letter of Government Land Policy&#13;
Background&#13;
1.          The 1953 Agrarian Reform the legal and institutional system has played a&#13;
key role in land redistribution and elimination of latifundio. However, in the past twenty&#13;
years there have been many irregularities in the allocation and administration of the&#13;
nation's land, a situation which underscores the necessity of a thorough study and review&#13;
of the Agrarian Reform process in order to bring it into line with current needs. This&#13;
entails both moving into a consolidation phase with regard to the advances made since&#13;
1953 and facing up to new challenges.&#13;
2.          The deficient institutional application of the Agrarian Reform Law, coupled&#13;
with the unproductive institutional arrangements, have given rise to seven types of major&#13;
constraints and distortions in land tenure structure, agricultural growth and management&#13;
of the country's natural resources:&#13;
(a) The current legal framework, while most successful in eliminating latifundio and&#13;
redistributing land in the Andean regions to those who were working it, does not&#13;
recognize or respond effectively to the different social, economic and cultural&#13;
contexts of land tenure in Bolivia. In particular, the present legislation does not&#13;
recognize the crucial role of the traditional ("canpesino") organizations in defining&#13;
agrarian property rights within their communities, in preserving and protecting&#13;
these rights and in resolving conflicts concerning them. However, the new Popular&#13;
Participation Law makes important improvements which need to be incorporated&#13;
into the new agrarian legislation. Moreover, the Agrarian Reform Law was&#13;
designed to deal with the latifundio situation prevailing in the Highland plateau and&#13;
Valleys and did not take into account the situation in the Eastern Lowlands,&#13;
especially the unused public lands and the historic land settlement and use rights of&#13;
the indigenous populations of the Bolivian Amazonian and Chaco territories.&#13;
(b) The arbitrary and irrational policy followed for allocation of public land in the&#13;
Eastem Lowlands, where it has been distributed practically free of charge and&#13;
without taking appropriate use into account, has sparked an extremely rapid&#13;
reconcentration of land holdi- ,- and, to some extent, a reversal of the Agrarian&#13;
Reform's main achievements during the first twenty years of its implementation.&#13;
As a result, forty years after the commencement of the process there is no&#13;
equitable land tenure structure.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 50-&#13;
(c) The outcome of this irrational land distribution policy--combined with deficient&#13;
and imprecise mapping of land awards and forestry concessions, together with the&#13;
jurisdictional conflict among the National Agrarian Reform Commission (CNRA),&#13;
the National Colonization Institute (INC) and the Forestry Development Center&#13;
(CDF)--has been an administrative chaos of overlapping land, forestry and mining&#13;
rights (involving farmers, ranchers, indigenous peoples, loggers, mining&#13;
concessions and oil and gas interests, etc.) which created widespread tenure&#13;
insecurity, especially in the Eastern Lowlands.&#13;
(d) In addition, the legal provisions on reversion of land to State ownership have&#13;
contributed to tenure insecurity for small, medium and large farmers and ranchers&#13;
(because whoever initiated the process could apply for the land). With the passage&#13;
of time, this reversion procedure has worked counter to the central objective of the&#13;
Agrarian Reform of breaking up latifundio in order to turn them over to the&#13;
peasants who worked them and has become a mechanism for transferring rights&#13;
among private individuals, with the participation and approval of the State.&#13;
(e) The State has never had a territorial planning policy and much less a policy based&#13;
on sustainable development and taking the use potential of land and other natural&#13;
resources into account. At present, attempts are being made to implement a policy&#13;
of this type. However, the overlapping of rights resulting from irrational&#13;
allocations in the past greatly complicates this work, to the extent of making it&#13;
impossible in some parts of the country without a prior regularization process and&#13;
scientific assessment of the potential of the rural lands.&#13;
(f) These policies and lacunae in the land legislation have also caused major&#13;
distortions in the land market, encouraging illegal land sales, limiting access to&#13;
credit for large sectors of production, holding down investment and, in general,&#13;
acting as a brake on the harmonious economic growth of the agricultural and&#13;
forestry sector.&#13;
(g) Finally, the excessive bureaucratization of the land allocation and agrarian justice&#13;
procedures was a factor in widespread corruption in CNRA, INC and CDF,&#13;
retarding the working ofjustice and causing excessive politicization in these&#13;
institutions. Absence of adequate institutional controls over CNRA and INC led&#13;
to the Govemment stepping in and introducing a moratorium on land transactions,&#13;
thereby launching a far-reaching legal and institutional reform process.&#13;
General Land Policy Principles and Objectives&#13;
3.           On the basis of the foregoing and in the context of the Governments&#13;
general policy, agrarian policy is govemed by the following general principles and&#13;
objectives: (i) treating land from an integral standpoint, taking into account its economic,&#13;
social, cultural, technical, political and historical connotations; (ii) guaranteeing technical&#13;
and legal security to agrarian property, under all types of ownership and holding, in order&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 51 -&#13;
to stimulate investment in land and facilitate the functioning of the formal and legal land&#13;
market; (iii) promoting an equitable tenure structure and giving priority in access to public&#13;
lands to landless peasant and indigenous people groups; (iv) promoting efficient and&#13;
sustainable use of the resource represented by land and of other natural resources; and&#13;
(v) fostering a legal and institutional system of land administration and conflict resolution&#13;
that is both transparent and effective.&#13;
Basic Thrusts of the Land Policy&#13;
4.          To accomplish the general objectives of the land policy, the Government's&#13;
strategy is based on five key pillars: (i) changes of substance in agrarian legislation;&#13;
(ii) role of Government intervention; (iii) institutional reforms; (iv) implementation of the&#13;
technical and legal regularization connected with the rural cadastre; and (v) application of&#13;
specific policies for resolving the problems of the minifundio and neo-latifundio.&#13;
Changes in Agrarian Legislation&#13;
5.          A crucial component of the Government's land policy is early submission to&#13;
Congress of the Bill to Amend the National Agrarian Reform Service (for the&#13;
establishment of the Land Institute) and a Cadastre Law. In a later stage, a draft Land&#13;
Law will be submitted to Parliament as an amended and updated version of the 1953&#13;
Agrarian Reform Law. Meanwhile, the Chamber of Deputies recently approved a new&#13;
Forestry Law, which now only requires Senate approval.&#13;
6.          With a view to resolving the problems detailed in the foregoing, the draft&#13;
Land Law will address the following central topics.&#13;
7.          Socioeconomic Function of Land. The Government will propose in its&#13;
draft Land Law that the socioeconomic function concept be aligned on the present&#13;
situation as to productive use of the land, equity in its distribution and ecological&#13;
implications. In addition to crop farming and stock raising, this concept will include&#13;
sustainable forest management and biodiversity conservation as sources of preservation of&#13;
the right of ownership over land.&#13;
8.          Definition of the Different Types of Ownership of Rural Land. The new&#13;
Land Law will be sufficiently flexible to reflect and respect the diversity of social partners&#13;
and the heterogeneity of agrarian activity in the country, in such a way that it will support&#13;
the dynamics of change and evolution of the agricultural sector.&#13;
9.          Reversion and Expropriation. The grounds for reversion and&#13;
expropriation of private lands will be redefined and the procedures employed will be&#13;
amended. The present reversion mechanism, by which the initiator of the reversion&#13;
process can claim the land, will be eliminated. However, the principle of reversion of land&#13;
to the State will be maintained as a form of penalty for leaving land unproductive. In&#13;
addition, the principle of expropriation (with compensation) by the State for purposes in&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 52 -&#13;
the public interest (for infrastructure and housing construction, etc.), will also be&#13;
maintained.&#13;
10.          Policy on Distribution of Public Lands. The land distribution policy will&#13;
be implemented in the context of national and regional plans for rational land use, taking&#13;
into account the different possible altemative uses, such as agriculture, stock raising,&#13;
sustainable forestry, national parks, protected areas, biodiversity reserves, indigenous&#13;
peoples' lands, etc. There will basically be two mechanisms for distributing public lands:&#13;
(i) land will be allocated free and on a priority basis to indigenous communities and, in&#13;
areas not exceeding 50 ha, or the limits set for smallholdings by regions in the Agrarian&#13;
Reform Law to landless peasants (as part of land settlement programs); and (ii) in the&#13;
areas declared regularized by the Land Institute, public lands will be allocated at market&#13;
prices as determined by public competitive bidding. In other words, there will be no more&#13;
free land allocations to individuals who do not meet the criteria for settlement program&#13;
beneficiaries. Once the law is approved, all purchases of regularized private lands will&#13;
have to be effected through the market.&#13;
11.          Land Market Regulation. By making a distinction between the lands held&#13;
by indigenous communities and all other privately owned land, the regulation of market&#13;
transactions involving the former will then be based on the rules and customs of the&#13;
communities concerned, while dealings in the latter will have to be in accordance with the&#13;
civil regulations and procedures in effect.&#13;
12.          New Forestry Legislation. The Government has placed before Congress a&#13;
new Forestry Law (already approved by the Chamber of Deputies) that will substantially&#13;
change the exploitation of the country's forest resources as follows:&#13;
(a) the new law will put an end to the overlapping of rights to land and forests,&#13;
through the combining of these rights under the "forestlands" concept;&#13;
(b) the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Environment will be charged with&#13;
classifying all the country's forestlands, differentiating between forestlands with&#13;
protection forest, forestlands with permanent production forests, forestlands&#13;
with conversion forest, multiple-use forestlands and forestlands without forest&#13;
or plant cover;&#13;
(c) on public forestlands with permanent production forests will be granted by&#13;
means of public competitive bidding, except in the case of indigenous&#13;
communities or original local population groups, who will be able to obtain&#13;
forestry concessions on request subject to submission of management plans duly&#13;
approved by the respective regulatory body;&#13;
(d) clear rules will be established for forest use and exploitation, on both public&#13;
forestlands and forestlands to which private individuals hold title;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 53 -&#13;
(e) in the event of conflicts, private individuals (whether farners, ranchers,&#13;
communities or indigenous peoples) holding duly regularized enforceable titles&#13;
to forestlands will be given preference for forest use concessions or contracts;&#13;
and&#13;
(f) a decentralized institutional system will be established, with creation of SEFOR&#13;
at national, departmental and provincial level, in order to exercise adequate&#13;
control and oversight over forest resources.&#13;
Role of Govermment Intervention&#13;
13.         The Govemment fimily intends to maintain the moratorium on grants of&#13;
public lands until the regularization process has been completed.&#13;
14.         The Govemment's Intervention in the CNRA - INC is an essential step for&#13;
reforming the present national land administration system. The Intervention is accordingly&#13;
fully authorized and is empowered by the Govermment, through the relevant legal&#13;
instrument (Supreme Decree or Ministerial Resolution), to take all necessary measures&#13;
for: (i) creation of the Project Coordination and Administration Unit (UCAP),&#13;
establishment of the Special Account and startup of the Project; (ii) coordination and&#13;
agreement with the Supreme Court on the final version of the Agreement; (iii) preparation&#13;
of the technical specifications for intemational bidding on the Cat-San; (iv) coordination of&#13;
the programs for coordinating and preparing the draft versions of the Registry and&#13;
Cadastre Law and of the Land Law; (v) creation of the Land Policies Analysis Unit&#13;
(UDAPTI) in coordination with the Ministry of Sustainable Development and&#13;
Environment (it remains to be specified where the UDAPTI will be located in the&#13;
Ministry); and (vi) preparation of the Project Implementation, Land Settlements and&#13;
Regularization Criteria manuals, in coordination with the Ministry of Sustainable&#13;
Development and Environment.&#13;
Institutional Reforms&#13;
15.         In order to implement the structural reforms envisaged by the Government,&#13;
a new de-bureaucratized, efficient and transparent institutional system will be essential.&#13;
The Government is accordingly undertaking the considerable task of creating and&#13;
establishing a Land Institute, the Agrarian Jurisdictional Agency (Organ Jurisdictional&#13;
Agrarian - OVA) and the Legal Cadastral Registry (Register Legal Catastral - RLC).&#13;
16.         National Land Institute (IN77). INTI will be responsible for administering&#13;
land resources, for which it will take the place of the CNRA and INC. It will have its own&#13;
capital and will operate under the oversight of the Ministry of Sustainable Development&#13;
and Environment. INTI will exercise jurisdiction in rural areas nation-wide, through&#13;
departmental and regional offices, and will be the agency charged with enforcing&#13;
compliance with all current and future agrarian legislation. INTI's main powers include:&#13;
(i) implementation of land distribution, redistribution and reversion policies;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 54 -&#13;
(ii) implementation of the technical and legal regularization of agrarian property&#13;
ownership; (iii) implementation and coordination of land settlement policies; (iv) ruling on&#13;
all petitions concerning rural land, the allocation and granting of which are entrusted to&#13;
specialized entities; and (v) perfornance of the country's first legal cadastral survey.&#13;
17.          Agrarian Jurisdictional Agency (OJA). WiU be created by law (through&#13;
the law modifying the National Agrarian Reform Service) and will be responsible for&#13;
administering agrarian justice and resolving land holding conflicts between private&#13;
individuals.&#13;
18.          Legal Cadastral Registry (RLC). The Property Registry (Derechos Reales&#13;
DDRR) offices do not presently have the technical and administrative capacity to handle&#13;
public registry functions for rural areas, neither are they fully capable of doing what is&#13;
needed in urban areas. The main problem that needs to be resolved as soon as possible,&#13;
for both urban and rural areas, is the geographic and spatial base of the rights registered.&#13;
This base is obtained through the cadastre.&#13;
19.          For rural land, the problem is a little more complex, owing to the existing&#13;
conflicts, such as overlaps, title duplications, lack of precise technical data and so on. The&#13;
National Land Administration Project (PNAT) accordingly includes a component aimed at&#13;
strengthening the public registry through creation and operation of the Legal Cadastral&#13;
Registry. This Registry, which will replace the existing (urban and rural) Property&#13;
Registry, will be under the oversight of the Judicial Branch and will have, as one of its&#13;
primary functions, responsibility for maintaining cadastral information.&#13;
20.          The Supreme Court, as the topmost authority with responsibility for the&#13;
present Property Registry, is participating in the design of this component. To this end,&#13;
the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Environment and the Supreme Court have&#13;
signed a cooperation agreement for joint implementation of the Registry components of&#13;
the Land Administration Project.&#13;
Technical and Local Regularization and Legal Rural Cadastre&#13;
21.          In order to rectify the procedural defects and eliminate the overlapping of&#13;
rights affecting many agrarian properties, a technical and legal regularization of the&#13;
position of agrarian property will be carried out.&#13;
22.          General Regularization Criteria. The main features of the regularization&#13;
have already been defined in the agreed draft version of the law establishing the Land&#13;
Institute, namely that:&#13;
(a) regularization is a suitable instrument for correcting procedural defects, for&#13;
identifying availability of land, for providing security of tenure and for facilitating&#13;
operation of the legal land market;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 55 -&#13;
(b) regularization is a special and transitory process in its different modalities&#13;
(normal regularization or Cat-San), with an execution period of five years, with&#13;
possibility of extension if the goals set have not been accomplished and the&#13;
means for further execution are available;&#13;
(c) regularization is a mechanism that promotes and enables the amicable resolution&#13;
of conflicts;&#13;
(d) the Land Institute is authorized to review all dossiers (titled and to be titled) in&#13;
order to ensure that the aims of regularization are met throughout the Republic;&#13;
(e) the Cat-San (integrated cadastre and regularization) will be performed by&#13;
administrative initiative. Areas will be declared subject to Cat-San when one or&#13;
more of the following factors is of significance: irregularity in agrarian&#13;
procedures; presumption that the land in the area is not performing a social&#13;
function; potential for identifying land for settlement, on the basis of the purpose&#13;
for which the land is used;&#13;
(f) regular regularization will be done on request only in cases of overlapping or&#13;
double titling. Regular regularization will be done by administrative initiative&#13;
only in areas where there is overlapping with classified areas (national parks,&#13;
indigenous peoples' lands, forest reserves, etc.);&#13;
(g) Cat-San areas will be declared by Supreme Resolution (i.e., by the President of&#13;
the Republic), while the areas subject to regular regularization will be declared&#13;
by Administrative Resolution of the Land Institute;&#13;
(h) the execution of the regularization will be gradual and systematic, to assist in the&#13;
territorial planning process being carried out by other Government agencies;&#13;
(i) the regularization will be consistent with legislation (State Constitution, Agrarian&#13;
Reform Law and other current legislation) in force at the time the rights are&#13;
obtained, bearing in mind that working of land is the basic justification for&#13;
obtaining and retaining right of ownership thereto;&#13;
(j) where allocations in excess of the areas specified for smallholdings were acquired&#13;
through defective procedures, such allocations will be officially canceled by the&#13;
Agrarian Jurisdictional Agency;&#13;
(k) land which is not worked within two years from the issuance of the decision, as&#13;
specified in the Agrarian Reform Law, will revert officially to the State in&#13;
accordance with the procedure to be laid down in the implementing regulations&#13;
of the Land Institute Law;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 56 -&#13;
(1) resolutions that result from the regularization process may have the effect of&#13;
canceling, modifying or confirming existing allocations or creating new ones.&#13;
These will be Supreme Resolutions (President of the Republic) when the dossier&#13;
in question already includes title or a Supreme Resolution, but in the case of&#13;
dossiers without Supreme Resolution or title they will be INTI Administrative&#13;
Resolutions;&#13;
(m) appeals against regularization resolutions must be filed in accordance with the&#13;
Civil Code (in the case of Supreme Resolutions) or through the Agrarian&#13;
Jurisdictional Agency (in the case of Administrative Resolutions);&#13;
(n) Departmental Agrarian Commissions will be created, in which the Government&#13;
and all sectors involved will participate, to ensure proper implementation of the&#13;
regularization process;&#13;
(o) rural communities and indigenous peoples will have priority in land allocation&#13;
versus applications by individuals, if it is demonstrated that such communities or&#13;
peoples formerly possessed the land in question;&#13;
(p) properties (whether original allocations or subsequently purchased) that are&#13;
larger than the areas specified for smallholdings will be titled after technical-legal&#13;
inspection by the Land Institute and certification by the appropriate organization&#13;
(CSUTCS, CSCB, CIDOB, Agricultural Chambers) to verify that the land is&#13;
performing a social function, in accordance with the development plans; and&#13;
(q) properties on forestlands (according to the zoning that will be made following&#13;
approval of the new Forestry Law) which have agrarian or stock raising titles&#13;
will have priority over forestry concessions (if the Forestry Law so specifies) and&#13;
will have to comply with the requirements of said Law. If the requirements of&#13;
the Law are not met (forest tax not paid or use rules violated, for instance), the&#13;
land will revert to the State; it may not be allocated to private individuals, but&#13;
may be used for forestry concessions. Forestland dossiers not including a title&#13;
will have two years to regularize their status and shall be governed by the&#13;
provisions of the Forestry Law.&#13;
Titling&#13;
23.         In areas not subject to regularization (regular or Cat-San): (i) small-&#13;
holdings and rural communities with a Supreme Resolution will be titled without any other&#13;
requirement except that the Resolution be made executory; (ii) if there are conflicts or&#13;
objections to the titling, these shall be referred to the Agrarian Jurisdictional Agency; and&#13;
(iii) proceedings in respect of which no ruling has been given shall be considered new&#13;
proceedings.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 57 -&#13;
24.         New Proceedings: (i) new proceedings will be conducted by means of a&#13;
simplified administrative process decentralized at departmental level, with active&#13;
participation of the regional offices of the Land Institute. Since this is an administrative&#13;
procedure, there will be no need for agrarian judges to issue decisions. In the event of&#13;
conflicts or objections, amicable settlement of the conflict will first be sought by Land&#13;
Institute staff. If such efforts prove unavailing, the conflicts will be referred to the&#13;
Agrarian Jurisdictional Agency; (ii) the dossiers will only be forwarded to the Land&#13;
Institute central office in La Paz for issuance of the title and signature by the competent&#13;
authority; (iii) as long as the regularization process is taking place, requests will only be&#13;
accepted in respect of community lands, classified areas and properties not exceeding&#13;
50 ha or the limit set for smallholdings established in the Agrarian Reform Law; and (iv) in&#13;
areas declared regularized, applications in respect of new lands will be accepted from&#13;
private individuals; such lands wrill be sold at market prices as determined by public&#13;
auction and will be titled on the basis of the land classification in the use plans.&#13;
25.          The Stages of the Cat-San (7ntegrated Cadastre and Regularization&#13;
System). Cat-San is a territorial planning instrument that combines the cadastre and&#13;
regularization processes and is designed to regularize, inventory and record rural property.&#13;
This system will be applied solely in cadastral areas and the stages involved will be:&#13;
(a) determination of areas; (b) review; (c) publicity and information campaign;&#13;
(d) cadastral surveys; (e) technical and legal evaluation; (f) availability for public scrutiny;&#13;
(g) resolution; (h) declaration of cadastral area; and (i) entry in Property Register (RLC).&#13;
26.         For application of this instrument, the Government will weigh various&#13;
economic, technical and sociocultural factors in order to rank the cadastral areas by&#13;
priority.&#13;
Recognition, Demarcation and Titling of Indigenous Peoples' Lands&#13;
27.          The policy document makes no mention of the Governrent's plans&#13;
concerning the question of the indigenous peoples' lands (or traditionally community-&#13;
occupied lands) in the country. The Government intervention measures have already&#13;
made significant progress toward recognition and demarcation of indigenous peoples'&#13;
lands, acting in coordination with the National Secretariat of Ethnic, Gender and&#13;
Generational Affairs (SNEGG) and through cooperation in the preparation of the Beni&#13;
Indigenous Peoples Development Project to be financed by the International Fund for&#13;
Agricultural Development (IFAD, Rome).&#13;
28.         To respond effectively to the problems posed by indigenous peoples' lands,&#13;
three interrelated strategies are called for (which will be specifically referred to in the&#13;
policy document): (i) changes must be proposed in the agrarian legislation in order to&#13;
clearly define the rights and responsibilities of the indigenous peoples concerning the land&#13;
they traditionally occupy. These proposed changes would be spelled out in the new Land&#13;
Law and would be in accordance with Article 171 of the new Political Constitution of the&#13;
State and with Law 1257 (which ratifies ILO International Convention No. 169) that&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 58 -&#13;
comrnits the Government to adjusting its legislation and institutions to comply with the&#13;
requirements of said Convention; (ii) performance of such technical and cartographic&#13;
work, and anthropological and other studies as are needed for the definitive demarcation&#13;
of traditional community lands; and (iii) the Government will take appropriate steps to&#13;
clarify the legal status of the Indigenous Peoples' Territories created by Supreme Decree&#13;
and to redefine the areas (and boundaries) of these territories on the basis of technical&#13;
criteria and socioeconomic and anthropological studies.&#13;
Recognition of Women's Rights to Land Ownership&#13;
29.          Under the current agrarian legislation, women have the same rights as men&#13;
as regards applying for allocation (or consolidation) of land holdings and to receive&#13;
executory titles in their name (as stipulated in the 1953 Agrarian Reform Law). However,&#13;
the traditional customs in many regions of the country prevent assertion of these rights.&#13;
To overcome these problems, the Government will carry out an awareness campaign on&#13;
women's rights to land ownership.&#13;
Specific Policies Minifundio and Neo-latifundio Problems.&#13;
Land Settlement Policy&#13;
30.          From the start of the Land Administration Project, the Government will&#13;
implement a new land settlement policy based on nine essential criteria: (i) identification&#13;
of existing public lands with agro-livestock potential and those that will be subject to&#13;
reversion through the regularization process and which are suitable for settlement, in&#13;
accordance with the use plans; (ii) performance of a technical and legal evaluation of these&#13;
lands to ensure that there is no overlapping of classified areas, indigenous peoples' lands,&#13;
forest reserves, etc.; (iii) performance of basic technical studies on these lands to ascertain&#13;
their suitability for settlement; (iv) taking of such legal steps as are necessary to reserve&#13;
these lands on a priority or exclusive basis for settlement purposes; (v) execution of land&#13;
settlement programs in response to specific demands for land and identification of&#13;
program beneficiaries on the basis of simple and expeditious poverty criteria; (vi)&#13;
performance of the looting of the land allocated to the beneficiaries, either by community&#13;
or in individual allotments, according to the circumstances; (vii) coordination with other&#13;
public and private bodies regarding investments in basic public services, road&#13;
infrastructure and so on; and (viii) periodic evaluation of the progress of the land&#13;
settlement programs.&#13;
Recovery of Cost of Public Investments and Tax Policy&#13;
31.         In order to prevent unproductive concentration of holdings and speculation&#13;
in rural land, the Government intends to apply a progressive policy of recovering the cost&#13;
of the Cat-San. The details of the cost-recovery mechanism are given in a separate&#13;
document. In short, it is the Government's intention to establish a single charge payable&#13;
by Cat-San beneficiaries that will be collected at the time the final cadastral certificate is&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 59 -&#13;
issued, after the "Resolution" stage. This charge is not a tax on the land (taxation will be&#13;
handled in coordination with the respective Basic Territorial Organizations&#13;
(Organizaciones Territoriales de Base - OTBs) in accordance with the Popular&#13;
Participation Law), but represents recovery, by the State, of the increase in value of the&#13;
land resulting from the greater security of tenure afforded by the Cat-San. The proceeds&#13;
of this charge will be divided between the Land Institute (as the chief entity involved in&#13;
administering the National Land Administration Project) and the Legal Cadastral Registry.&#13;
This charge will be applied on a progressive basis, in such a way that a first stratum of&#13;
properties would be exempt from payment and the rest would pay a fixed amount per&#13;
hectare, according to the size of the property.&#13;
Inter-institutional Coordination&#13;
32.         Inter-institutional coordination is a major function of the Ministry of&#13;
Sustainable Development and Environment. The procedures and mechanisms for this&#13;
coordination will be established in accordance with the priorities and objectives of the&#13;
National Land Administration Project. Activities will be coordinated among the ministry,&#13;
the Secretariat of Natural Resources, the Secretariat of Agriculture and Livestock, the&#13;
Secretariat of Rural Development, the Undersecretariat of Territorial Planning, the&#13;
Undersecretariat of Ethnic Affairs and others having to do with land.&#13;
33.          Coordination at the higher level will be handled by the National&#13;
Development Council, which is charged with proposing, discussing, coordinating and&#13;
recommending economic and social policies and the national strategies. The Council is&#13;
empowered to call on other authorities, public servants and experts, and also to set up&#13;
intersectoral commissions for various purposes.&#13;

ANNEX 2&#13;
BOLIVIA&#13;
NATIONAL LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
Summary of Proposed INTI Law (National Agrarian Reform Service)&#13;
1.          The National Agrarian Reform Service (Servicio Nacional de Reforma&#13;
Agraria, SNRA) would be headed by the President of the Republic and consists of the&#13;
National Agrarian Commission (Comisi6n Nacional Agraria), INTI (Instituto National de&#13;
Tierras) and the Agrarian Courts. The National Agrarian Reform Service would supervise&#13;
the formulation and implementation of agrarian policies.&#13;
A. The National Agrarian Commission.&#13;
2.          The National Agrarian Commission would be presided by the Minister of&#13;
Sustainable Development and Environment and be composed of representatives of the&#13;
Government, the Chamber of Agriculture, the Confederation of Land Workers Syndicates,&#13;
the Colonization Syndicate and the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples. The&#13;
Commission's role would be to: (i) monitor the agrarian reform process; (ii) propose land&#13;
laws and regulations; (iii) oversee the implementation of the Government's land policy;&#13;
and (iv) propose the nomination of the Director of the National Land Institute&#13;
B.  National Land Institute&#13;
3.          The National Land Institute (Instituto Nacional de Tierras, INTI), under&#13;
the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Environment (MDSMA), would replace&#13;
both the National Council for Agrarian Reform (Consejo Nacional de la Reforma&#13;
Agraria, CNRA) of the former Ministry of Campesino and Agricultural Affairs, and the&#13;
National Institute of Colonization (Instituto Nacional de Colonizaci6n, INC), of the&#13;
Office of the Presidency. INTI would become the single public technical body with&#13;
authority on matters related to land distribution and titling.&#13;
4.          INTI's permanent functions would be to: (i) execute policies related to&#13;
land distribution, reversion, redistribution and settlements; (ii) distribute and title public&#13;
lands, including reverted lands; enforce established land use norms; (iii) prepare programs&#13;
to achieve equitable land distribution, giving priority to campesinos and indigenous&#13;
people; (iv) maintain a data bank on actual and potential land use; and (v) coordinate&#13;
public entities which provide infrastructure, basic services and technical assistance to&#13;
settlement areas.&#13;
5.          INTI's transitory responsibilities would be to: (i) regularize titles&#13;
through the resolution of title disputes, especially cases of duplicative claims, and&#13;
correction of judicial and technical errors in land title records; (ii) revert to the State title&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 61 -&#13;
for lands obtained in violation of the Agrarian Reform Law; and (iii) establish an&#13;
information system, to serve as a basis for the future National Cadastre, documenting the&#13;
location and extension of: (a) all lands distributed under the Agrarian Reform; (b) fiscal&#13;
lands available for distribution; (c) public lands reserved by law; (d) private agricultural&#13;
properties; and (e) lands whose title have been reverted to the State and available for&#13;
redistribution.&#13;
6.          INTI would consist of an Executive Director, Departmental Directorates&#13;
and Regional Divisions. The Executive Director (ED) would supervise and coordinate the&#13;
execution of agrarian policies and appoint the executive staff of the Regional Offices. The&#13;
term of office of the ED, along with that of the other INTI executives, would be four&#13;
years. To protect against a recurrence of the politicization which pervaded INTI's&#13;
institutional predecessors, there would be provisions to ensure the political independence&#13;
and professional qualifications of these nominations.&#13;
7.          Under the new law, involvement of the Office of the Presidency in land&#13;
issues would be limited to supervision, planning and execution of agrarian policies. The&#13;
Office would no longer directly participate in land conflict resolution. By means of a&#13;
Supreme Decree, the power to sign titles would be delegated from the Office of the&#13;
Presidency to INTI.&#13;
8.          INTI's La Paz office would be divided into four Divisions: Land&#13;
Settlement, Geographic Information, Title Regularization, and Administration. In&#13;
addition, it would be supported by Offices of the Legal Advisor, Information, Planning&#13;
and Internal Audit.&#13;
9.           The role of the Land Settlements Division would be to direct and supervise&#13;
land distribution policies, guarantee that land programs support sustainable development&#13;
and coordinate with Municipalities the execution of titling and settlement programs. The&#13;
Geographic Information Division would supervise the implementation of the plan for a&#13;
national Cadastre, including the collection of relevant data, preparation of required&#13;
technical and legal regulations, supervision of samples, and prioritization of sites for the&#13;
Cadastre. The responsibilities of the Title Regularization Division would be to develop an&#13;
effective and efficient system for issuing new titles and establish a process for title&#13;
legitimization and regularization.&#13;
10.         The Departmental Directorates (DD), located in the each of the nine&#13;
departmental capitals, would ensure the implementation of INTI's policies and programs&#13;
at the departmental level. The directorates in La Paz, Cochabamba, Chuquisaca and Santa&#13;
Cruz, where land conflicts are concentrated, would include special teams, partly financed&#13;
by an IDA credit, to implement the Cat-San process. Departmental Directorates would&#13;
provide technical assistance to campesinos and indigenous people related to the Land&#13;
Titling Program. Nineteen Regional Divisions would support the Departmental&#13;
Directorates.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 62 -&#13;
11.         Funds to finance INTI's operations would be derived from allocations from&#13;
the National Treasury, institutional income and bilateral and multilateral grants and loans.&#13;
C. National Agrarian Courts&#13;
12.         Agrarian conflict resolution would be carried out by the National Agrarian&#13;
Courts (Organo Jurisdiccional Agrario). The National Agrarian System is being&#13;
designed. It is expected that it will be responsible for administering agrarian justice and&#13;
resolving land holding conflicts between private individuals. It is also expected that, at the&#13;
local level, the Agrarian Court would have nine departmental offices which would&#13;
adjudicate land rights conflicts.&#13;
D. Land Record Regularization&#13;
13.         PMT would be empowered for a period of five years (with possibility of&#13;
extension) to review and regularize titles issued by the CNRA and INC through two&#13;
processes: the integrated cadastral review (Cat-San) and the simple review (SAN). Cat-&#13;
San, refers to the technical and judicial procedures regularizing property rights in a given&#13;
area and correct procedural errors in order to authorize and register titles. SAN,&#13;
conducted upon request of the parties in conflict, is the technical and judicial procedure to&#13;
correct errors in titles to land outside the integrated cadastre.&#13;
14.         Titles issued by CNRA and INC, found to be illegal, could be nullified by a&#13;
Supreme Resolution. Other irregular titles could be nullified by an Administrative&#13;
Resolution issued by INTI. Administrative Resolutions could be contested in the Agrarian&#13;
Tribunal decisions taken by which would be final.&#13;
15.         INTI's resolutions would be: (i) annulment of land rights (where laws have&#13;
been broken); (ii) modification of existing land rights; (iii) confirmation of existing rights;&#13;
and (iv) establishment of new rights (where de-facto occupation produces a right).&#13;
16.         Land, in areas which have been regularized, would fall under the&#13;
jurisdiction of INTI and the Agrarian Courts. In areas which have not yet been&#13;
regularized, no requests for land would be accepted, with the exception of land for:&#13;
(i) indigenous groups; (ii) natural resources protection zones; and (iii) small properties as&#13;
defined by the Agrarian Reform Law with a maximum of 50 ha. INTI would be solely&#13;
responsible for the determination of an area as regularized.&#13;
17.         The results of the regularization process would serve as the valid source of&#13;
legal information concerning boundaries and the technical and legal identification of rural&#13;
properties. This information would be transferred gradually to the RLC.&#13;

ANNEX 3&#13;
BOLIVIA&#13;
NATIONAL LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
Summary of Proposed Cadastre and Registry Law&#13;
A. Cadastre Law&#13;
1.          The purpose of the Law of the Legal Cadastre would be to regularize and&#13;
establish technical norms and standards for the execution and maintenance of a legal&#13;
cadastre and guarantee property rights and possession of rural land. It would be the&#13;
judicial instrument to: (i) establish the basic legal requirements for execution and&#13;
maintenance of a national legal cadastre; (ii) authorize INTI to set norms, regularize and&#13;
facilitate the initial rural cadastre survey; (iii) establish the authority for the gradual&#13;
transfer of the cadastral information to the Cadastral Registry; and (iv) standardize the&#13;
technical and legal terminology related to the cadastre. A pre-requisite for a valid transfer&#13;
of property, within a cadastred area, would be the presentation of the property's&#13;
Cadastral Code to a Notary Public. In addition, rural properties would be required to&#13;
have a Certificate of Regularization issued by INTI.&#13;
2.          INTl would help to set the standards for, finance, execute and maintain the&#13;
rural cadastre. In the event that some of these responsibilities would be delegated to other&#13;
entities, INTI would supervise and approve the cadastre work. Once an area is declared a&#13;
cadastred area by an administrative resolution of INTI, the cadastre information could be&#13;
transferred to the Registry. This information would be open to the public and could be&#13;
only modified through judicial channels.&#13;
3.          When discrepancies occur between physical cadastral results and property&#13;
title regarding the geographic location, boundaries or area of a parcel, the physical results&#13;
would prevail. The cadastre would allocate area under contention to the individual who is&#13;
in possession of, or is working the land. These determinations could be modified only by a&#13;
judicial resolution. The preparation and presentation of a new cadastral plan would be&#13;
required for any transfer or physical modification of property. The cadastral plans would&#13;
be valid only when approved and inscribed in the legal Cadastre.&#13;
4.          Cadastral survey of a property would include the following:&#13;
(i) determination of the cadastral polygons; (ii) legal and technical parcel identification&#13;
through cadastral measurement based on the national geodesic network; (iii) preparation&#13;
of a cadastral file, dated and signed by the field work supervisor; (iv) preparation of the&#13;
parcel delineation; (v) preparation of the cadastral plan with geographic identification;&#13;
(vi) adjacent properties and total area at a specified scale; (vii) preparation of a cadastral&#13;
map; and (viii) location and codification of the parcel within the cadastral maps.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 65 -&#13;
5.           The cadastral information would be maintained by: (i) up-dating cadastral&#13;
documents to reflect changes regarding property; (ii) assigning new cadastral codes&#13;
whenever property is divided; and (iii) up-dating the cadastral maps.&#13;
B. Registry Law&#13;
6.           The Law of the Registry of the Legal Cadastre would set out procedures&#13;
for inscription in the Registry. The Registry 's purpose would be to: (i) guarantee&#13;
property rights; (ii) maintain property rights records with accurate legal and physical&#13;
identifications; and (iii) keep for public review the inscription of property rights and liens&#13;
on such rights.&#13;
7.           The Registry (Registro Catastral Legal) would be the only specialized&#13;
office with responsibility for maintaining a land registry, which would retain all judicial&#13;
acts which constitute, modify, transfer or nullify property rights or other rights related to&#13;
real estate. The Registry would include: (i) judicial acts which are public documents;&#13;
(ii) judicial resolutions; and (iii) private documents requiring legal recognition.&#13;
8.           There would be two forms of registration: Definitive Enrollment: which&#13;
is the registration of an act of property rights or of other rights when they satisfy legal&#13;
requirements. Definitive enrollments could be requested by parties with legitimate&#13;
interests or by judicial mandate. Documents could be enrolled when stamped and&#13;
accompanied by a topographical plan approved by the legal cadastre and the property&#13;
registration card. In addition to the above, agrarian properties need to present the&#13;
Certificate of Regularization issued by INTL. Preventative Enrollment: would be the&#13;
temporary or provisional placement of a title in the registry constituting a precautionary&#13;
measure to guarantee the property rights of a party. These would be valid for two years,&#13;
but upon request, could be extended for an additional year. Upon presentation of the&#13;
appropriate documentation, a preventative enrollment could be converted into a definitive&#13;
enrollment.&#13;
9.           Registry of the Legal Cadastre: The Registry, under the Supreme Court,&#13;
would be a decentralized administrative institution, composed of a National Directorate&#13;
(based in Sucre); Departmental Directorates and Regional or Provincial offices. The&#13;
National Directorate would be responsible for the establishment of policy and institutional&#13;
finance. The Departmental Directorates, located in the departmental capitals, would have&#13;
operational responsibilities for the management of the Registry. The Regional Offices&#13;
would have responsibilities similar to those of the Departmental Directorates. Provincial&#13;
Offices would be established according to regional need.&#13;
10.          The National Director and the Departmental Directors would be designated&#13;
by the Supreme Court for terms of office of six years and four years, respectively. The&#13;
chiefs of the regional and provincial offices would be nominated for four year terms by the&#13;
National Director.&#13;

ANNEX 5&#13;
BOLlVIA&#13;
NATIONAL LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
Proposed Cat-San, Cadastre and Registration Process&#13;
1.          This Annex describes the title regularization process, the establishment of&#13;
the legal cadastre, and the registration procedures of the new land administration system,&#13;
once 1NTI and RLC have been created. Although the establishment of INTI and the&#13;
introduction of a Legal Cadastral Registry is required to fully develop the new land&#13;
administration system as envisaged by Government, it is not a necessary condition to&#13;
initiate most of the activities aimed at eventually achieving this objective. In fact, within&#13;
the context of the current transitional land administration framework, the only activities&#13;
related to title regularization and registration which can not be carried out include:&#13;
(i) conflict resolution in cases where intermediation efforts by the Comisi6n de&#13;
Intervenci6n do not result in a joint agreement between landowners, thus requiring a&#13;
decision by the judiciary; and (ii) registration of cadastral plans containing the&#13;
geographical dimensions of properties.&#13;
Background&#13;
2.           Bolivia maintains a fiscal cadastre and does not yet have a legal cadastre.&#13;
Since the spatial precision of a fiscal cadastre is less demanding than of a legal cadastre,&#13;
this fiscal cadastre cannot address most of Bolivia's land-related problems, stemming from&#13;
unmarked boundaries, uncertain or conflicting titles and other legal complication.&#13;
3 .          There are two cadastres types:&#13;
(a)   Legal Cadastre: The legal cadastre is a record of legally recognizable&#13;
rights to land. It includes an unambiguous definition of the spatial&#13;
dimensions of individual parcels and a related record defining right holders&#13;
and the nature and basis of their rights. By definition spatial and legal&#13;
records are closely related and, in some cases may be integrated in the&#13;
same records&#13;
(b)   Fiscal Cadastre: The fiscal cadastre contains information used for&#13;
assessment and taxation functions. The reference unit should be the legally&#13;
defined property parcel. However, many fiscal cadastres maintain a spatial&#13;
record which only approximates the legal recorded does not accurately&#13;
reflect the legal situation. Most legal cadastres are based on the fiscal&#13;
cadastre. In Bolivia, this approach is not advisable because of considerable&#13;
rural opposition to land taxation. As local support is crucial to cadastre&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 68 -&#13;
establishment and maintenance, such opposition would slow the cadastre&#13;
progress.&#13;
4.           Comparing Fiscal and Legal Cadastres: While both legal and fiscal&#13;
cadastres use the property parcel as a basic unit of reference, each cadastre is designed for&#13;
a different purpose. The fiscal cadastre contains information on factors influencing&#13;
property values. Because of the changing value of properties, fiscal records require&#13;
systematic updating. In contrast, legal cadastre focuses on the land tenure status of a&#13;
parcel, requiring updating on a transaction-by-transaction basis. The spatial precision&#13;
required by the fiscal cadastre unless demanding than that required by its legal counterpart.&#13;
Generally, a fiscal map can not support a legal cadastre, while information from a cadastral&#13;
map is sufficient for fiscal purposes.&#13;
5.           Dericiencies of the Present Land Administration System: One of the&#13;
main reasons why the current land administration system in Bolivia is seriously deficient is&#13;
that it finds its base in the frequently obsolete and contradictory property descriptions&#13;
provided in the records of Derechos Reales. Lack of precise spatial information in these&#13;
records creates confusion about the location and dimension of a property upon which a&#13;
right has been established. The Derechos Reales defines the right which has been&#13;
established on a piece of land and only vaguely describes the property, in terms of its&#13;
topographical relation with surrounding properties and reference points (colindantes).&#13;
6.           In few cases, a graphical presentation of the property (plano) has been&#13;
voluntarily registered with the title or escriturapziblica. But, this plano is often&#13;
incomplete, as no technical norms have been set for drafting pianos. In addition, the&#13;
plano does not necessarily reflect the actual field situation, since its registration does not&#13;
require a technical review nor verification against other properties or conflicting property&#13;
claims.&#13;
Title Regularization and Legal Cadastre Process (Cat-San)&#13;
7.           The objective of the title regularization and legal cadastre (catastro con&#13;
saneamiento: Cat-San) process is to provide a reliable, up-to-date and authoritative&#13;
record of existing land rights land. This requires: (i) identification of de facto land rights&#13;
in the field, information which is not available in any public records, including those in the&#13;
Registry or other related agencies; and (ii) conformity to certain legal requirements,&#13;
including registration of a deed or contract in the Registry. The result of the process&#13;
would be a set of information recorded in the Register of Legal Cadastre (RLC),&#13;
describing the land rights of holders, the nature and basis of these rights, as well as the&#13;
spatial dimensions of the rights (area, geographic location, parcel dimensions). To achieve&#13;
this, Cat-San would require the following technical and juridical tasks:&#13;
8.           Step 1:       Selection of Priority Areas: The criteria for prioritizing&#13;
Cat-San areas should be finnly tied to the broader goals of the project: (i) solve land&#13;
conflicts; (ii) identify potential settlement areas for small farmers and (iii) improve the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 69 -&#13;
capacity for better environmental management. Criteria to be considered would include:&#13;
(i) frequency of land disputes and demand for regularization; (ii) presence of available&#13;
public lands for distribution; (iii) availability of private lands with good agricultural&#13;
potential which could be reverted to public lands for re-distribution; (iv) areas of strong&#13;
agricultural development; (v) areas with planned infrastructure projects; and (vi) pressure&#13;
on valuable natural resources. Once prioritized, boundaries of Cat-San areas would be&#13;
clearly defined, preferably by using highly visible and easily identifiable ground features&#13;
such as rivers and roads.&#13;
9.          Step 2:      Office Investigation: This step would compile land tenure&#13;
information available from government institutions, including registry information from&#13;
Derechos Reales, base maps, aerial photography and plans from IGM, titles and plans&#13;
from the archives of CNRA and INC. The information would be used for planning and&#13;
preparing field work, but would never be regarded as definitive. The results would be&#13;
contained in a 'mosaic" comprised of reliable plans and maps integrated onto a single map&#13;
sheet (or set of adjoining map sheets) covering the Cat-San area. A list of owners and&#13;
other title information would also be compiled.&#13;
10.         Step 3:      Project Publicity/Promotion: A publicity campaign, using&#13;
radio, TV and newspaper, would be directed towards residents and landholders in the Cat-&#13;
San area, informing them of Cat-San's goals, benefits and timetable, and inviting them to&#13;
participate (i.e., clearing boundary lines, areas around property comers and corners).&#13;
Wherever possible, community leaders would be involved.&#13;
1I.         Step 4:      Field Investigation: Fieldwork would consist of a juridical&#13;
component, carried out by legal members of the field team, and a technical component, the&#13;
responsibility of surveying engineers and technicians.&#13;
12.         Juridical Investigation: The juridical investigation is concerned with the&#13;
nature of the existing rights in the parcel, who holds those rights, and the basis for the&#13;
claims to such rights. The information would be recorded on a cadastral card (ficha&#13;
catastrat). Minimum requirements for a valid claim (e.g., years of possession, documents,&#13;
necessary witness signatures) would be included in the legal framework prior to field&#13;
investigations. Special care would be taken not to exclude women who have valid land&#13;
claims. The legal framework would clarify in whose name the property would be&#13;
registered. If it is the head of household, than consideration would be given to securing&#13;
the rights of women who are not heads of households.&#13;
13.         Boundary Investigation and Demarcation: The surveyors would focus&#13;
on the identification, demarcation and documentation of property boundaries (linderos).&#13;
They would walk the boundaries, with the property owner and adjacent owners (in&#13;
communities, the community leader would also be part of this group), identifying&#13;
boundary lines and markers. In instances where the markers are not permanent, new&#13;
monuments would be set. The signatures of the affected parties would be obtained if a&#13;
matter of unclear or disputed boundaries were to be resolved in the field. Traditional&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 70 -&#13;
dispute resolution mechanisms would be used to the maximum extent possible so that the&#13;
community leaders would be involved in the process. Parties to the dispute would be&#13;
advised of the appeal mechanisms.&#13;
14.         Cadastral Survey: Field survey units would carry out a cadastral survey&#13;
of all corner points. Initially, Global Positioning System (GPS) methodologies would be&#13;
used to obtain coordinate information for these points. In some areas, it may be more&#13;
cost-effective to use aerial photography to measure the positions of parcel corners. The&#13;
field teams will draw sketches (croquis) of measured boundaries so that both metric&#13;
(measurement) and topological (relative position of corners and parcels) data would be&#13;
available. The boundary information would be compiled and plotted to form a cadastral&#13;
map covering all parcels in the district. Individual parcel plans (plano catastral) would&#13;
also plotted and registered in the RLC.&#13;
15.         Step 5:      Comparison of Field Results with Land Records: To&#13;
check the field data for quality and consistency, the juridical (ficha catastral) and&#13;
boundary information (mapa and plano catastral) would be collated and linked by means&#13;
of a provisional parcel identifier. Cross-checking against the mosaic and other information&#13;
from the formal records would establish the extent of the discrepancies between the de&#13;
facto land tenure situation and the one depicted by the public record. The output would&#13;
be a list of current owners (or claimants) and a cadastral map depicting all parcels in the&#13;
Cat-San area.&#13;
16.         Step 6:      Conciliation Process by INTI: Complaints and objections&#13;
would be heard in the first instance by the head of the departmental judicial directorates,&#13;
relevant members of the field teams and community leaders. In complex conflict&#13;
situations, INTI would start a conciliation process on the basis of an in-house manual of&#13;
rules and procedures governing the settlement of disputes and conflicting claims. If&#13;
conflicts can not be resolved, the matter would be brought before the Superior Agrarian&#13;
Tribunal, which would take a final decision.&#13;
17.         Step 7:      Publication of Field Results: The list of current owners&#13;
and claimants, together with the cadastral map, would be advertised in a public office of&#13;
the main town of the district to obtain a final response from landowners and claimants as&#13;
to the veracity of the results. If no objections are received within a set period (30 or 60&#13;
days), the list, cadastral map and parcel plans would be transmitted to the RLC for&#13;
registration.&#13;
18.         Step 8:      Registration and Issuance of Registry Certificates&#13;
(a)   Cadastre Area: Thirty to sixty days after publication of the field results,&#13;
INTI would sign a resolution declaring the areas "Area-Catastradd' The&#13;
cadastre information would be registered within RLC and entered directly&#13;
into the RLC maintenance process.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
-71 -&#13;
(b)   Registration: Integration of the cadastral information into an improved&#13;
and modernized version of the current Registry will be facilitated by the&#13;
new component of this office (see below). New legal information on the&#13;
proprietors and the nature of their land rights would be initially contained&#13;
in cadastral forms (fichas catastrales) and used to modify existing&#13;
information in the Registry. The legal framework would establish the&#13;
validity of the incoming information vis-a-vis the old information. Since&#13;
the incoming information will generally be more current, reliable and&#13;
accurate than the existing information base, legal priority would be given to&#13;
the new information.&#13;
(c)   Issuance and Maintenance of Registry Certificates: The final step in the&#13;
regularization process would be the issuance of Registry Certificates to the&#13;
registered owners. This Certificate clearly would identify the geographic&#13;
location and dimensions of the registered parcel, the owner(s), the type of&#13;
right, date of registration and issue, and obligations to report any changes&#13;
due to transfers or subdivisions. An integral part of the Certificate would&#13;
be the cadastral plan, which would describe geographic characteristics of&#13;
the parcel (area, dimensions of sides, monument descriptions, angles or&#13;
azimuths, coordinates if used, administrative locale, parcel identifier, parcel&#13;
identifiers of adjoining properties, etc.). The only piece of information that&#13;
would appear on both the plan and the Certificate would be the identifier,&#13;
C6digo Cadastral, of the subject parcel. The Certificate should be clear&#13;
and succinct and used only for property transactions within the Registry.&#13;
Survey, Mapping and Land Information System&#13;
19.          Topographical Surveys: The project would establish a standardized&#13;
cadastral survey methodology, based on existing standards for topographical surveys in&#13;
the country and the experience gained from the pilot-studies. Standards and norms would&#13;
be established for cadastral surveying to support Cat-San and the maintenance of cadastral&#13;
data. Within the cadastre maintenance process, cadastral surveyors would do a survey and&#13;
draw up new cadastral plans wherever there is a change in parcel boundaries. The&#13;
absolute positions of boundary corners would be established and reflected on the cadastral&#13;
plan so that, if the physical monuments disappear, the corner positions could be re-&#13;
established. Conventional (tachometry/electronic distance measurement and the tape) as&#13;
well modern surveying-methods (total station and GPS) would be used.&#13;
20.          INTI would establish and adjust national cadastral standards and norms in&#13;
accordance with technical developments and social and legal requirements. IGM as the&#13;
national topographical map-producer, would provide the legal cadastre with the&#13;
topographical framework for the cadastral index-maps (mapa-catastral). RLC would be&#13;
responsible for: (i) updating the cadastral index-map; (ii) reviewing cadastral information&#13;
that enters the system in the form of cadastral plans; (iii) incorporating these individual&#13;
plans into a general cadastral plan which will serve to update the cadastral record; and&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 72 -&#13;
(iv) administering supplementary survey points and monumented property corner points,&#13;
necessary for local cadastral maintenance.&#13;
21.          Aerial Photography: New aerial photography would be required for an&#13;
area of approximately 1.5 million hectares and serve as base information for the cadastral&#13;
surveying activities. Photography would be taken at an approximate scale of 1:40,000 in&#13;
black and white. INTI would use airborne GPS to minimize ground control requirements&#13;
if photography is to be used for base mapping purposes. Depending upon the property&#13;
sizes, the aerial photography would be enlarged to a scale of 1:20,000 or 1:10,000. INTI&#13;
would not rectify the photography and would use it mainly for photo-interpretation and&#13;
administrative purposes.&#13;
22.          Cadastral Sketches (Croquis), Cadastral Plans and Cadastral Maps:&#13;
The Cat-San field team would draw a croquis, a cadastral sketch, not to scale, which&#13;
reflects parcel characteristics, such as the status of its boundary-line (i.e., if it has been&#13;
defined or if it is in conflict) and corner-points. It also includes: (i) information on&#13;
provisional cadastral codes (c6digo de levantamiento); (ii) relevant topography within or&#13;
outside the property; (iii) measurements obtained directly in the field; (iv) sketches of the&#13;
monumented property corner-points; and (iv) if necessary, a written explanation of the&#13;
legal implications of the property.&#13;
23.          Based on this sketch, the surveyor would draft the cadastral plan. The&#13;
plan, plotted to scale, would show the parcel's dimension, form and topology, in relation&#13;
to its neighboring properties. The cadastral plan would contain the following: (i) date of&#13;
field survey and name/signature of surveyor; (ii) graphic illustration of the parcel drawn to&#13;
scale; (iii) parcel identifier of subject parcel as well as adjoining parcel identifiers (shown&#13;
on graphic plan); (iv) distances and azimuths of boundary lines; (v) description of corner&#13;
monuments; (vi) coordinates of boundary corners (if available); and (vii) basis for&#13;
coordinates (control points used). It would also contain a table with the ID-number&#13;
(unique per plan) of the boundary monuments and its coordinates, referenced to the&#13;
national grid system. Once the plan has been accepted and registered in the legal cadastre,&#13;
the official cadastral code (c6digo catastral) would be added to the plan. As the plan&#13;
contains information exclusively related to the property (and not to the property right&#13;
holder), it would need to be adjusted only when the parcel size or dimension are modified.&#13;
24.         These plans would fit into the framework of the cadastral map. The&#13;
cadastral map would become available through analytic restitution from aerial&#13;
photography, digitization of existing analog topographical plans, or field-surveys. The&#13;
map (in digital and analog format), at a scale of 1:20,000 or 1:10,000, would function as&#13;
an overview map on which the c6digo cadastral would be visualized.&#13;
25.          Whenever the cadastral plan and the map were found to be in&#13;
contradiction, the cadastral plan would be adjusted to conform to the map. Hence, the&#13;
cadastral plan would have to be developed according to the scale of the cadastral map&#13;
(1:10,000 and 1:20,000) and take into account the precision criteria for the cadastral map.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 73 -&#13;
To guarantee quality of the cadastral plan, only surveyors with the relevant professional&#13;
code would be entitled to prepare cadastral measurements (croquis and plmo) and present&#13;
plans for registration.&#13;
26.          Land Information Management and GIS: The land administration&#13;
information system would introduce an alphanumeric database and a GIS, as weli as&#13;
provide for efficient data-processing and retrieval. Further, the integrated information&#13;
system would provide inter-institutional data-communication - essential guaranteeing&#13;
consistency between both data-bases. The info-communication system would promote&#13;
efficient data access and directly link the legal and cadastral databases. A study, to&#13;
identify the technical needs for facilitating inter-institutional communication between the&#13;
Registry and the legal cadastre so that the alphanumeric and the graphical information&#13;
could be updated efficiently, is being prepared.&#13;
27.          The GIS system would: (i) accept digital boundary data collected via GPS&#13;
or photogrammetry and integrate these into a computerized cadastral map; (ii) integrate&#13;
descriptive or attribute data from the juridical investigation undertaken as part of the Cat-&#13;
San process; (iii) provide an efficient connection between attribute and computerized plan&#13;
information; (iv) create the initial cadastral plans by extracting relevant attribute and&#13;
graphic data and presenting this at the individual parcel level; (v) maintain the cadastral&#13;
map by incorporating new cadastral plans; (vi) maintain a Registry database by&#13;
incorporating changes in the legal status of parcels (e.g., transfers); and (vii) maintain a&#13;
database of scanned documents and plans.&#13;
28.          The initial GIS strategy would be to start with a modest PC-based system&#13;
to facilitate of personnel training and minimize software and hardware maintenance. As&#13;
the level of activity increases and more personnel are trained, the GIS would graduate to a&#13;
UNIX-based work station platform. Professionals would receive extensive training on:&#13;
system management, system maintenance, administrative programming, technical&#13;
programming, digitizing techniques, and design of GIS application software.&#13;
The Registration Process&#13;
29.          Present System: The present registry system is a rudimentary registration&#13;
of deeds from which certain information is extracted and "inscribed' in a register.&#13;
Inscription is designed to provide security to landholders by publicizing land transactions.&#13;
Entries in the register are organized chronologically and indexed by name of the grantor or&#13;
grantee. There is no legal requirement that land transactions be registered. However, in&#13;
the event that a landowner sells the same property to different buyers through different&#13;
conveyances, the buyer who registers first is regarded the legal owner. Unregistered&#13;
conveyances are valid between seller and purchaser, but have no effect against third&#13;
parties.&#13;
30.         In Bolivia, most rural properties are not registered for several reasons:&#13;
(i) over-centralization of Registry offices creates problems of access for rural people;&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 74 -&#13;
(ii) lack of appreciation of the security that registration provides against third parties;&#13;
(iii) high registration fees; and (iv) lengthy and complex titling processes. Those parcels,&#13;
which are registered, are usually so poorly defined, particularly with respect to geographic&#13;
location, that parcel superposition and uncertainty (and disputes) as to the correct&#13;
boundary line are unavoidable. In addition, the Registry contains obsolete and inaccurate&#13;
information due to informal land subdivisions.&#13;
31.          Reforms to the Existing System: To provide a clear and unambiguous&#13;
record of land parcels and rights, the existing registration system needs to be reformed as&#13;
summarized below.&#13;
32.          Cat-San would create an accurate and updated record of all properties and&#13;
landholders to be recorded in the Registry. Part of the recorded document would include&#13;
a cadastral plan based on a reliable field survey of each parcel, providing an unambiguous&#13;
definition of the location and dimensions of each parcel. A technical cadastre office would&#13;
be added to the Registry to monitor the quality of the cadastral plans submitted to the&#13;
Registry and maintain a complete cadastral map. Public access to Registry information&#13;
would be improved by providing computer terminals allowing easy access to the Registry&#13;
database; permitting direct public access to actual documents (or copies); and establishing&#13;
a formal information requisition process. The Registry information would be organized&#13;
and indexed on a parcel-basis as opposed to a grantor/grantee-basis so that all rights&#13;
would be referenced against clearly identified parcels. A computerized index would be&#13;
created cross-referencing parcels (identified by a unique parcel identifier) to right holders,&#13;
document numbers, and administrative areas (department, province, secci6n, etc.) to&#13;
facilitate data access. Documents required for registration would be simplified by&#13;
providing standard pre-printed forms to facilitate the electronic scanning and data&#13;
extraction. The services of the Registry would be decentralized to increase their&#13;
accessibility to the public.&#13;
33.          Registering Land Rights: Registration versus Titling  Titling is the initial&#13;
granting or "patenting" of state-owned land to private owners. These should be registered&#13;
in the Registry to have effect against third parties. Registration includes registered titling&#13;
cases as well registered changes to the property parcel or transfers of property rights.&#13;
34.          Registerable Transactions: Three kinds of land rights can be inscribed in&#13;
the Registry: (i) full land ownership rights; (ii) secondary rights (e.g., leases); and&#13;
(iii) encumbrances (e.g., liens, mortgages, servitude). Any transactions that create,&#13;
transfer, modify or extinguish these rights should be reflected in the Registry.&#13;
Article 1540 of the Civil Code contains detailed list of these transactions.&#13;
35.          Registration Documents: Under the proposed registration system, the&#13;
primary documents to be registered would be the cadastral plan and deeds (escrituras&#13;
publicas). The cadastral plan would be produced by a private land surveyor contracted by&#13;
the owner(s) of the parcel being subdivided or consolidated. Notaries would be&#13;
responsible for preparing deeds in accordance with current procedures. However, the&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 75 -&#13;
deeds would be simplified and standardized so that the information could be more readily&#13;
extracted and computerized. The future role of notaries within the new system would&#13;
need to be re-examined and re-defined.&#13;
36.         If a parcel were to be transferred as is (i.e., with no subdivision or&#13;
consolidation), then no new cadastral plan would be required and the old plan would&#13;
simply be attached to the new deed. The documents presented at the Registry would&#13;
therefore comprise a deed and a related plan. These would always be presented together.&#13;
The responsibility for presenting these documents to the Registry would lie with the&#13;
parties to the transaction.&#13;
37.         Quality Control and Verification: Once the documents have entered the&#13;
Registry and the date and time of receipt have been stamped on the face of the documents,&#13;
the plan and the deeds/contracts would be separated. The deed/contracts would be&#13;
checked by the Legal Department of the RLC to verify that the grantor (seller) does&#13;
indeed own the land rights that he/she is conveying and that the deed is complete (i.e.,&#13;
contains all required information, such as parties to the transaction, parcel identifier,&#13;
addresses, etc.).&#13;
38.         The cadastral plan would be submitted to the cadastral department of the&#13;
Registry for checking and verification. A new plan would be checked for completeness,&#13;
internal consistency (mathematical closure of the figure), as well as external consistency&#13;
(data on plan is consistent with the parent and adjoining parcels). If either the deed or the&#13;
plan were deficient in some way, it would be returned to the party who submitted the&#13;
documents. Repetitive submission of deficient documents prepared by the same notary or&#13;
surveyor would result in disciplinary action against that person. If documents were&#13;
acceptable, the cadastral department would, in the case of a new plan, allocate a new&#13;
parcel identifier (c6digo catastraf) and the plan and deed would be transmitted to the&#13;
Register.&#13;
39.         The Register: Like the current Register in Bolivia, the new RLC would be&#13;
created by extracting certain information from deeds and cadastral plans. But the RLC&#13;
would be organized so that each page in the RLC would represent an individual parcel.&#13;
The following information would be inscribed in the RLC: parcel identifier, grantor,&#13;
grantee, date of registration, type of transaction, cadastral map number, cadastral plan&#13;
number (if different from the parcel identifier), deed number, area (hectares or square&#13;
meters), and administrative locale. Initially, the RLC would be kept in an unbound book&#13;
form. Eventually, when all the information is computerized, the RLC would become a&#13;
database and reside entirely on a computer (with back-up tapes for security). The RLC&#13;
would be located in the Legal Department of RLC.&#13;
40.         Maintenance of RLC: Maintenance of the cadastre and registry would be&#13;
divided into two components. The first and most important is the acquisition of&#13;
information which describes land transactions (e.g., subdivisions, transfers). Depending&#13;
on the transaction, this information could comprise of a deed and cadastral plan.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 76 -&#13;
41.         Without information on land transactions, RLC would soon become&#13;
obsolete. Therefore, disincentives to register (inaccessibility, high cost, processing delays,&#13;
etc.) need to be reduced and the registration benefits to landholders (e.g., tenure security,&#13;
credit, etc.) promoted. Up-dated information would be acquired on a transaction-by-&#13;
transaction basis. Under certain circumstances (e.g., extensive adverse possession or&#13;
conflicts), the Registrar would have the power to initiate a re-survey and to change&#13;
registry records.&#13;
42.         The second maintenance component would be updating and managing&#13;
geographic (cadastral plan and map) and RLC information. An automated information&#13;
system which reduces duplication and links relevant data entities, would facilitate&#13;
updating. Current efforts to develop a prototype information system for the RLC intend&#13;
to take advantage of modem technologies and simplify RLC maintenance.&#13;
43.         Historical Archive: Even a modem land information system would&#13;
depend upon the Derechos Reales as a juridical backup. Within the integrated land&#13;
information system, the folios of the Derechos Reales for each parcel in an area catastrada&#13;
would be scanned and stored on optical disc. Each folio would receive a code allowing&#13;
for the rapid retrieval of the document's image. The scanned images would be integrated&#13;
with the alphanumeric database (digital format of the ficha cadastral). An authorized copy&#13;
of these scanned images could be requested. Once RLC is operational, all new registered&#13;
documents would be scanned on optical disk and paper originals returned to the owners.&#13;
44.         Institutional Framework: INTI and the DNCU (Direccidn Nacional de&#13;
Catastro Urbano) would be responsible for developing norms and policies for the rural&#13;
and urban cadastres. DNCU would focus on the urban fiscal cadastre, and INTI on the&#13;
legal cadastre in both rural and urban areas. The institutions would collaborate closely to&#13;
facilitate the eventual conversion of the urban fiscal cadastre into a legal cadastre. INTI&#13;
would be directly involved in the implementation of the legal cadastre in rural areas. In&#13;
cases where Municipalities choose to implement the rural cadastre themselves, INTI&#13;
would provide guidance, setting design and implementation standards to ensure that the&#13;
resulting cadastre could be integrated into the legal cadastre.&#13;
45.         The roles of both INTI and the Municipalities in the legal cadastre would&#13;
be transitory. Once the RLC is operating, all information would be transferred to RLC&#13;
and subsequent maintenance of the information would become RLC's duty. As RLC&#13;
would be the only source for current, legal information with respect to parcel boundaries&#13;
and legally registered land rights, the Municipalities, which would continue to administer a&#13;
fiscal cadastre, would have access to RLC data.&#13;
46.         Ultimately, RLC would cover urban and rural areas and be guardian of&#13;
legal information describing the geographic dimensions of all property parcels, as well as&#13;
the nature of land rights and their holders. There would be at least one RLC office in each&#13;
department. Additional offices could be set up at more decentralized levels (e.g.,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 77 -&#13;
Municipality or province), depending on the frequency of transactions and viability of&#13;
establishing a permanent decentralized RLC office. To increase public assess to the&#13;
services of RLC, several local collection offices would be identified. Notaries offices&#13;
could serve in as a depository for deeds and cadastral plans to be collected periodically by&#13;
RLC emnployee. The Municipal offices could also serve as local depositories, but the need&#13;
to separate the registration from the taxation process (and minimize disincentives to&#13;
register transactions) makes the Notaries a preferable alternative.&#13;
47.         RLC would consist of a legal department, a technical department and an&#13;
information department. The legal department would examine incoming documents, such&#13;
as new deeds, and address legal questions. The technical department would examine&#13;
cadastral plans and ensure that the geographic information entering RLC conforms with&#13;
minimum standards. The information department would computerize information and&#13;
maintain databases containing cadastral and registry information. This information would&#13;
be managed by a geographic information system (GIS).&#13;

ANNEX 6&#13;
BOLIVIA&#13;
NATIONAL LAND ADMINISTRATION PROJECT&#13;
Land Settlement Policy&#13;
1.           The objectives of the land settlement policies are to: (i) guarantee property&#13;
rights of new and former beneficiaries of land adjudication; (ii) take measures to reserve&#13;
areas identified as suitable for land settlements; (iii) respond to the pressures of over-&#13;
population and farm fragmentation in the Andean region through the establishment of land&#13;
settlements; (iv) cooperate and coordinate with other institutions in the consolidation of&#13;
existing settlements; and (v) direct new settlements in an equitable, effective and&#13;
transparent manner.&#13;
2.           These goals would be achieved through five activities: (i) identification of&#13;
suitable land; (ii) reservation of land; (iii) land use studies; (iv) selection and preparation of&#13;
beneficiaries, and (v) donation of land in basic land allocations . Within the context of the&#13;
current interim land administration framework, activities related to land settlement&#13;
programs which can be carried out by the Comisi6n de Intervenci6n I include:&#13;
(i) identification of lands suitable for land settlement; (ii) reservation of land;&#13;
(iii) implementation of land use studies; and (iv) selection and preparation of beneficiaries.&#13;
3.           Areas would be considered potential sites for settlement on the basis of&#13;
their legal availability, agro-climatic characteristics, soil potential, topography, basic&#13;
infrastructure, possibility of service delivery, basic sanitation and distance to markets.&#13;
Those lands would be registered in the DDRR and reserved for use in the program.&#13;
4.           Program beneficiaries would include: (i) individual farmers seeking new&#13;
land; and (ii) existing communities or groups of farmers or other groups which the&#13;
Government determines should receive land (e. g., people living in protected areas,&#13;
resettled mniners, population settlements near national borders, etc.). In the case of areas&#13;
with an exceptionally high agricultural potential, priority would be given to those&#13;
individuals or groups: (i) with extensive farming experience; (ii) between 20 and 40 years&#13;
old; (iii) in good health; (iv) who are already organized as a group or a community; and&#13;
(v) with a relatively high level of education.&#13;
5.           Within INTI, the Land Settlement Division (AAHH) would have primary&#13;
responsibility for the implementation of the land settlement policies and coordination of&#13;
the institutional strategies through the preparation of studies, programs and plans, and&#13;
provision of training and orientation.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 79 -&#13;
6.           AAHH would: (i) prepare plans, programs and projects for land&#13;
settlement; (ii) evaluate the economic, technical and social capacities of land reserved for&#13;
settlement to determine the appropriate land allocation size based on an analysis of soil use&#13;
and type, as found in the Land Use Plan (Plan de Uso de la Tierra, PLUT), available&#13;
infrastructure and socioeconomic conditions; (iii) analyze needs for basic infrastructure&#13;
and services; and (iv) prepare project proposals, and coordinate, with other institutions,&#13;
the preparation and execution of basic infrastructure projects in the settlement areas.&#13;
7.           AAHH would analyze the following: (i) conditions of the existing&#13;
settlements, to identify major bottlenecks to development, coordinate institutional support&#13;
to correct these deficiencies and regularize land titles; (ii) economic and social viability of&#13;
potential settlement areas given their natural resources, infrastructure and market assess;&#13;
and (iii) socioeconomic conditions of rural Andean zones of relatively high net emigration&#13;
to identify problems and formulate policy guidelines to support campesino economy. In&#13;
addition, the Division would conduct a pilot cadastre survey in selected Andean areas to&#13;
increase understanding of land tenancy structure, land conflicts and forms of resolution,&#13;
and degree of organization.&#13;
8.           With respect to settler training and orientation, AAHH would: (i) inform&#13;
and familiarize future colonist of the availability of land and conditions in settlement areas;&#13;
supervise settlement programs; (ii) establish and maintain contact with support&#13;
organizations; (iii) evaluate the adaptation process of the new settlements and their degree&#13;
of social organization; and (iv) coordinate health and environmental campaigns in the&#13;
settlements.&#13;
9.           Central to INTI policy would be to ensure that settlers are well informed&#13;
concerming the conditions, positive and negative, of their future habitat, including those&#13;
related to climate, productive activities, health and disease, basic sanitation and housing.&#13;
In addition, settlers would become familiar with their legal status, titling requirements, plot&#13;
size and methods to measure boundaries. Settlers would also receive information&#13;
concerning appropriate and environmentally sustainable technological practices for the&#13;
new area, price system of local markets and identification of appropriate markets for&#13;
different crops and sources of technical assistance.&#13;
10.          AAHH would finance training, to be provided through outside agencies,&#13;
including NGOs, to future candidates of public and privately-initiated settlement&#13;
programs. Priority for training would be given to those populations living in zones with&#13;
adverse climatic conditions, high concentration of small farms, displaced miners or&#13;
relatively high incidence of poverty. In addition, training would be given to selected&#13;
younger settlers to develop a cadre of rural promoters in the new settlements who could&#13;
lead the community in land use management, food production, health campaigns and&#13;
developing planning.&#13;

ANNEX 7&#13;
BOLIVA&#13;
NATIONAL LAND ADMINSTRATION PROJECT&#13;
Environmental Analysis&#13;
1.          Most components of the proposed project are either benign or clearly&#13;
beneficial from an environmental standpoint. For example, a major outcome of the project&#13;
is expected to be increased land tenure security for many farmers and other landholders.&#13;
This would be environmentally beneficial, because persons with secure land tenure rights&#13;
are more inclined to use land-conserving practices.&#13;
2.          The component requiring special environmental attention is the land&#13;
settlements program. This component would facilitate the distribution to small farmers of&#13;
certain public lands, along with lands which revert to the public domain as a result of the&#13;
project-supported Cat-San process. The extent to which these lands would actually be&#13;
settled during the project depends upon ease of access and related factors; lands presently&#13;
too remote for settlement would remain in a "land bank" administered by CI or INTI,&#13;
upon its establishment, until later allocation. Virtually all of the lands eligible for small&#13;
farmer settlement would be in the tropical or sub-tropical Lowlands.&#13;
Effects on Deforestation&#13;
3.          Land settlement in the tropics is controversial because of the deforestation&#13;
and related environmental and social problems which often result. However, the land&#13;
settlement program component is not expected to increase deforestation pressures, nor&#13;
does it seek to accelerate migration to the Bolivian lowlands.&#13;
4.          Colonization of the Eastern and Amazonian Lowlands by immigrants from&#13;
the Highland Plateau and the Valleys is an ongoing phenomenon. Presently, new migrants&#13;
to the lowlands often settle on lands which are ecologically fragile and poorly suited for&#13;
agriculture (particularly in the steep Andean foothills). Some settlement zones are legally&#13;
protected areas which lack demarcation or effective enforcement. Some migrants are&#13;
squatters on privately-owned land, where they lack tenure security and have no incentive&#13;
to invest in good land management. The land settlement program is intended to channel&#13;
some of this ongoing colonization pressure away from the more environmentally sensitive&#13;
lands and towards lands of good agricultural potential with secure tenure.&#13;
5.          Since 1992, the Government has imposed a moratorium on the distribution&#13;
(grant or sale) of public land parcels greater than 50 ha. This moratorium was established&#13;
(after intensive dialogue with the Bank) to facilitate the development of a more rational,&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 81 -&#13;
orderly, and socially equitable system of public land distribution, which is a major&#13;
objective of this project. However, the moratorium is widely understood to be a&#13;
temporary measure, not a permanent ban on public land distributions. In the absence of&#13;
this project, it is likely that public land distributions would resume, but with far fewer&#13;
environmental safeguards (see below).&#13;
6.          Moreover, the project seeks to ensure that public land parcels which meet&#13;
strict environmental criteria would be made available first to small farmers, rather than to&#13;
wealthy ones (which has typically been the case to date). It is likely that high-quality&#13;
agricultural lands which are outside of legally protected areas and close to roads will be&#13;
cleared for agriculture in the foreseeable future (particularly in Santa Cruz Department).&#13;
To the extent that such development is inevitable, it is more desirable from a social equity&#13;
standpoint that the deforestation be done by small farmers than by wealthy ones.&#13;
Environmental Safeguards&#13;
7.          To help ensure that the net environmental effects of the project would be&#13;
positive, the following environmental safeguards would be adopted. These safeguards&#13;
would be incorporated (as appropriate) within: (i) the Land Settlement Manual ; (ii) the&#13;
Government Policy Letter (a condition of effectiveness); (iii) the new Land Law and its&#13;
implementing regulations; and (iv) directly in the Credit or Project Agreement with IDA.&#13;
8.          Environmental Screening of Land Settlements. Prior to allocating any&#13;
public (including reverted) lands for grants to small farmers (or, where applicable, land&#13;
sales to other farmers), CI or INTI upon its establishment would carry out an&#13;
environmental screening process to ensure that the following conditions apply:&#13;
(i)    The lands in question must be well-suited for agricultural&#13;
development. Public land allocations would be based on the&#13;
existing land use plans. As part of the land settlement program&#13;
detailed soil studies of each land parcel proposed for settlement&#13;
(unless adequate soil information already exists) would also be&#13;
carried out. The Land Settlement Manual would specify how the&#13;
classification of the land use plans would relate to the intended use&#13;
(agriculture, livestock) of the lands.&#13;
(ii)    There would be no land settlements or public land sales in areas&#13;
occupied by indigenous people or necessary for maintaining their&#13;
traditional livelihoods. Those lands which are occupied or used by&#13;
indigenous peoples would be identified during the Cat-San process&#13;
which would be conducted in collaboration with the National&#13;
Indigenous Secretariat (Secretarla Nacional de Asuntos Enicos, de&#13;
Genero, y Generacionales) or qualified local indigenous&#13;
organizations, as appropriate. The lands found to be occupied or&#13;
used by traditional indigenous people would be titled to the relevant&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 82 -&#13;
indigenous communities; under no circumstances would these lands&#13;
be made available for new settlement.&#13;
(iii)    The land must not be needed to fill important ecological gaps in the&#13;
National Protected Areas System (SNAP). This screening process&#13;
would be carried out with the help of a "Negative List" already&#13;
under preparation (as part of the ongoing GEF Biodiversity&#13;
Conservation Project) by the National Biodiversity Conservation&#13;
Directorate. This list (including maps) would be approved by the&#13;
Minister of Sustainable Development and the Environment and&#13;
reviewed by the World Bank. It would specify those areas (such as&#13;
unique ecosystem types) which are not adequately represented&#13;
within the SNAP, and which should therefore: (a) not be made&#13;
available for land settlements or sales; and (b) be held in the public&#13;
domain until their eventual transfer to the National Biodiversity&#13;
Conservation Directorate or other qualified conservation&#13;
organizations. Until a definitive "Negative List" is completed, the&#13;
allocation of public lands through land settlements or sales would&#13;
require an Environmental Impact Assessment to be approved by the&#13;
National Secretariat for Natural Resources.&#13;
(iv)    No public lands would be allocated through grants or sales within&#13;
the officially designated buffer zone specified in the management&#13;
plan of any officially protected area. In case an officially designated&#13;
buffer zone does not exist, no public land parcel would be granted&#13;
or sold by the Government within five km of any official protected&#13;
area.&#13;
(v)   In the case of Santa Cruz Department, lands would not be available&#13;
for small farmer grants or sales if they lie within the zones&#13;
designated as "Forest", "Existing Protection", or "Proposed&#13;
Protection" under the official land use plan (PLUT). The Santa&#13;
Cruz PLUT was developed under the Eastern Lowlands Natural&#13;
Resources Management and Agricultural Production Project&#13;
(Credit No. 21 19-BO). In the future, if other land use plans are&#13;
approved by other departments and/or at the national level, land&#13;
settlements and sales would be made fully consistent with those&#13;
plans.&#13;
9.          Selection of Settlers. In the selection of potential settlers for the land&#13;
settlement program (in cases where excess demand for the lands exists), special&#13;
consideration would be given to persons who currently live within "zones of&#13;
environmental conflict" (including long-established squatters within protected areas). This&#13;
approach is expected to enhance further the environmental benefits of this project, by&#13;
reducing existing land pressures within environmentally sensitive areas.&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&amp;#12;&#13;
- 83 -&#13;
10.         Land Parcel Size. Settlers in the Latin American tropics have historically&#13;
been allocated relatively large land parcels, which has reinforced their tendency to select&#13;
extensive land uses (such as cattle pastures rather than more labor-intensive perennial&#13;
crops). To promote more efficient land use, the basic unit of land allocation in the land&#13;
settlement program would be determined through technical criteria based on the following&#13;
objectives: (i) to ensure that every participating family has enough land to build a future&#13;
for one generation; (ii) to maximize the number of beneficiary families on the lands&#13;
available for distribution; and (iii) to minimize the land area deforested per fhmily.&#13;
11.         Titling of Indigenous Lands. The project would substantially benefit&#13;
indigenous people by providing valid, well-defined land titles to many indigenous&#13;
communities. In the process, the need for a sufficient land base to enable the continuation&#13;
of traditional production systems (including hunting, fishing, gathering, and shifting&#13;
cultivation) would be carefully considered. In the case of indigenous communities which&#13;
receive communal land titles (in accordance with Convention 169 of the International&#13;
Labor Organization), INTI would develop regulations and procedures to help prevent&#13;
fraud or other abuses if the indigenous communities elect to rent out their lands to&#13;
outsiders (e.g., for lumbering or ranching).&#13;
12.         Avoiding Perverse Incentives For Deforestation. Land titling&#13;
procedures in Latin American countries are often blamed for creating "perverse&#13;
incentives" which encourage (or even require) deforestation to consolidate private land&#13;
claims. To avoid this problem, the new Land Law and Forestry Law are expected to state&#13;
clearly that deforestation is neither necessary nor sufficient for obtaining new land titles,&#13;
nor for protecting existing, legally valid titles. Even if these new laws do not deal with&#13;
this issue adequately, the Government has specified its commitment to avoid rewarding&#13;
new or recent deforestation in its land titling policies and procedures. Aerial photography&#13;
would be used to establish a benchmark for the determination of actual land use.&#13;
13.         Land Policy Analysis Unit. The new Land Policy Analysis Unit (Unidad&#13;
de Analisis de Politica de Tierras, UDAPTI) in the Ministry of Environmentally&#13;
Sustainable Development would be a high-level advisory body on national land policy&#13;
issues. To help ensure adequate consideration of environmental issues in its work,&#13;
UDAPTI would have at least one natural resources management specialist (such as a&#13;
biologist, ecologist, or forester). This requirement is specified in the terms of reference&#13;
for establishing the UDAPTI.&#13;

        <abstracts>
            The objectives of the National Land
            Administration Project will be to achieve a more efficient
            and transparent land administration system, clarify the land
            tenure situation, identify public land suitable for small
            farmer settlements and promote a more sustainable use of the
            country's land resources. The project will have a major
            component improving the land administration system within
            the current framework and a minor component implementing the
            legal and institutional land administration reforms, if and
            when they are introduced. The major component will support
            the formulation of a sound and coherent land policy and
            legislation, carry out land mapping on three million ha to
            obtain cadastre information and to regularize the land
            tenure situation wherever possible, indentify 500,000 ha
            suitable for small farmer settlement and increase the
            efficiency and transparency of the land administration
            system. In addition, the project will also finance: 1) title
            regularization and land settlement programs by the National
            Land Institute, when established; and 2) the introduction of
            an integrated legal cadastral registry system when the Legal
            Cadastral Registry is established.
