&#13;
                                                                                it wasn't aoaetbing that I wanted to do for long, and I took an&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Thank you so much, Hr. Lejeune, for coaina to the Bank to            opportunity to .ave to what was then the Loan Department as Assistant&#13;
&#13;
engage in this conversation today. We ai&amp;bt beain by ay asking if you           to the Loan Director and Secretary of the Loan Co.mittee of the Bank.&#13;
&#13;
would tell a bit about bow you caae to the Bank in the first place, and         In that capacity, I participated in the deliberations of the Loan&#13;
&#13;
about the important positions you bad in the Bank?                              Comaittee, which was the top loan policy-making body in the Bank.            In&#13;
&#13;
LEJEOHE:   After World War II, vben I vas   d~bilized,     I bad to search      tboae early daya, it was conaidering not only individual loans. but&#13;
&#13;
for a job, and I didn't quite koov which way to turn.       I consulted the     alao basic questions of what the      Bank'~   policy sbould be on making&#13;
&#13;
fathers of some friends of aine wbo were U.portant people in the                loane to various countries in the developing world. The scope of the&#13;
&#13;
financial world in Mev YOrk, and two of them sugaested that the World           deliberations was quite broad.&#13;
&#13;
Bank might be a place that would be interestina.      It vas just starting,             I continued in that function for a while, then moved into one of&#13;
&#13;
and, although they   dido'~   koov too aucb about it, they tbought that the     the operating positions in the Loan Department.         In those days,&#13;
&#13;
fact that it was just starting vas an opportunity to get in on the              operations -- all lending operations -- were handled by the Loan&#13;
&#13;
ground floor of a new inatitution. One aigbt see aoaething rather more          Departaent.    Tbere was a separate Economics Department which did the&#13;
&#13;
broadly of the financial aspects of the world than one would in working         work on the creditworthiness of countries and so on.         There was a&#13;
&#13;
in Wall Street.    So I came down to Waabington to &amp;et a job in the Bank.       special staff within the Loan Department consisting of half a dozen to&#13;
&#13;
     One of these people, George Harrison, at that tU.e      Cbai~an   of the   a dozen people who were concerned with the technical aspects of the&#13;
&#13;
New York Life Insurance Company, bad auggested that be would talk to            projects.     The Loan   Depar~ent   had three divisions, and I went to work&#13;
&#13;
Hr. (Eugene) Meyer about ay candidacy.      But it so happened, in the end,     in the one that was mainly concerned with European and African&#13;
&#13;
that I got the job myself by walking into the personnel office, filling         countries -- well, Europe, Africa and Australasia.         I continued in that&#13;
&#13;
out an application form and leaving it.      Shortly thereafter I waa asked     first aa a loan officer and then as a division chief.&#13;
&#13;
by the Director of Personnel, Bill Howell (later Director of                            Then there came a reorganization of the Bank, in 19S2, 1 think it&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                       3                                                                                    4&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
wae, and the Loan Departaent va1 aplit up into three "area"                      become the Europe, Africa and Auatralaaia Department. The function of&#13;
depar~entl.     A new eo-called technical Operations Departaent waa              Aaaiatant Director -- of which there was one in each department                was&#13;
&#13;
created to handle the project work on the loan applicationâ&#128;¢.         the         the a ..e aa what later became tenaed Deputy Director.&#13;
Ecoooaica Departaeot had ita functioua divided, 10 that the work on                     In tboae days, of course, Africa vas largely colonial Africa, and&#13;
&#13;
creditwortbineaa went with the new area departaente, and the .ore                so it was very natural to put the     Bank"~     African operations in the&#13;
&#13;
widely baled work on co.aodity projectionâ&#128;¢ and tbiaaâ&#128;¢ of that kind were          department reaponaible for the metropolitan countries which governed&#13;
&#13;
left in the lcoooaica Departaent.                                                the African dependenciea.     In fact, under the Bank".a constitution&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     The title of the Ecoooaica Departaent val cbao&amp;ed to the             ita Articles of Agreement -- a loan could be made to an African&#13;
&#13;
Reeearcb Departaentt                                                             dependency -- or any dependency for that matter -- only if the&#13;
&#13;
LEJEUNE:    Could be; 1 aueae it vaa.                                            aetropolitan country, aa a member of the Bank, would put ita guarantee&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     But the Technical Operationa Departaent, which vaa a precuraor       on the loan.&#13;
&#13;
of the later Projecta Departaent, wae concerned with technical                          Eventually, the Europe, Africa and Australasia Department was&#13;
&#13;
operationâ&#128;¢, beaefit-coet analyeea, technical feaeibility etudiea.                aplit, and all the African work vas put into a new Africa Department,&#13;
&#13;
LEJBUEMB:    And with eaaineering atudiee of projecta vbicb in tboae daya        but I reaained in what then becaae Europe and Australasia.&#13;
&#13;
vere of an infraatructural character.                                            Subaequently, I .oved to be Assistant Director in the Far East&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     In the early daya that   you'~e   nov talking about, vaa there any   Depar~ent     under Peter Cargill.&#13;
&#13;
aajor policy ca..ittee beaide the Loan eo. .itteet        Subaequently, there           It waa while I waa in that position that the Director of&#13;
&#13;
waa a Senior Staff, there vaa a      Preaident'~   Council, but I take it all    Adainiatration, Bill Howell, died.          I vas on a camping trip in the&#13;
&#13;
of tbeae came much later.                                                        Rocky Mountains.     I aade the mistake of calling my father to ask bow he&#13;
&#13;
LBJBUHB:     Theae caae later.   Certainly the aenior ataff vas never            vaa.    I called fro. a telephone booth, and be reported that someone&#13;
&#13;
really a policy group.     Soaet~ea   mattera were put to it by way of           called George Woods waa trying to get a hold of me.            Would I call him&#13;
&#13;
having a aoundio&amp; board, but it vasn",t a deci&amp;ioiHIUikina body of any           in Waahingtont     So I did, and George Woods asked me to come back to&#13;
&#13;
kind, whereas the Loan Co.aittee vaa.         The Loan Co.mittee reviewed a      Washington.    He said be wanted me to take over the job that waa left&#13;
&#13;
loan at various atagea and made deciaions aa to what vaa to be done.             vacant by Bill Howell ',a death.     So I   ca:~~e   back and after some&#13;
&#13;
     Eventually I becaae the Aaaiatant Director of what by then bad              discussion with him and others around the Bank, I agreed to do that for&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                             5                                                                                6&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
three years.     So I served for three years under WOods in that capacity.              covers today, which is to say, the Sudan and the countries south and&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:     Tbi1 waa what year?     '~5.    I think?                                    west, including Zaire, down to South Africa.&#13;
&#13;
LEJEUNE:     1 have to refresh ay   m~ry.                                                    I continued with that until 1974.     By that time there bad been a&#13;
OLIVER:     Mr. Howell died in the aumaer of 1964.                                      new reorganization -- in 1972 - and the department bad been divided&#13;
&#13;
LEJEUNE:    And 1 took over in that job in Septeaber of 1964, aa I                      into two program departments, both under a single vice president.&#13;
&#13;
re.ember.     When ay tour of duty doins that waa eoaina to an end, George                   I continued as one of the program Department directors until 1974&#13;
&#13;
aaked me at aoae point if I would be villin&amp; to continue for a further                  when the Bank had need to find a new Executive Secretary of the&#13;
&#13;
period of time in that funetioa..          1 said, ''Ho.''   Ad&amp;Diniatration waa oot    Consultative Group on International Agriculture Research.        This Group&#13;
&#13;
ay fint love in the Bank. I preferred to be on lendin&amp; operation&amp;, and                  waa aoaething which the Bank waa very largely responsible for creating&#13;
&#13;
10, when it waa convenient to him, I would like to .ave back to it.                     in 1971.     The purpose of it was to provide funds for running a system&#13;
&#13;
      It turned out to be convenient to him in the late spring of 1967                  of international agricultural research centers to develop technology&#13;
&#13;
when be wanted to create a new deparbaent to deal with the Middle East                  necessary to increase the productivity of agriculture, more&#13;
&#13;
and Horth Africa.     Be created that departaent and put me in charge of                specifically food production, in developing countries.         There was a&#13;
&#13;
it.   Eventually, the department also bec ..e reaponaible for European                  group of some thirty-five donora made up of all the major donor&#13;
&#13;
countries, moat of vhich were no longer borrowers from the Bank, tbough                 countries and multilateral aid organizations such as the World Bank,&#13;
&#13;
there continued to be a fringe of borrowing countries aloaa the                         the Inter-American Bank, tbe European Economic Community, the OPEC&#13;
&#13;
Mediterranean -- Portugal, Spain, Yugoslavia, Greece and Turkey.                 Also   Fund, and so on; plua, and most    ~portantly,   foundations&#13;
Finland, which was a special case:           it val difficult for it to borrow          particularly the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations, which had&#13;
in the aarket at reaâ&#128;¢onable rates because it val tbought to be                          established some of these internatiDnal agricultural research centers&#13;
&#13;
vulnerable to Soviet doainance.        The aaalgamated        Depar~ent   became the    initially.&#13;
&#13;
Europe, Middle Eaat and North Africa          depar~ent      which still exists as          Harold Graves was my    ~ediate   predecessor in this job, although&#13;
&#13;
BMEMl in tbe Bank today.                                                                the first Executive Secretary of the OGLAR was Arie Kruithof.        This was&#13;
&#13;
      I continued aa it1 director until 1970, when I moved to take on                   an activity in which Mr. McNamara took a strong personal interest.           As&#13;
&#13;
the job of Director of the !altern Africa Department, which in tbose                    ia well known, be had done a great deal to increase the Bank's&#13;
&#13;
days covered the aaae ground as the Eastern Africa Vice-Presidency                      attention to agriculture.    At this juncture, I guess the Bank was&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                        1                                                                             8&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
putting almost JS percent, aaybe more, of ita lending into agriculture;           and also, of course, the strong support of the other major donor&#13;
&#13;
and it waa evident that aucb of tbia lending would get nowhere if there           countries and inetitutions, has been largely responsible for seeing&#13;
&#13;
were not a packa&amp;e of new technology to     ao   with every agriculture           that the work continued and expanded into other kinds of crops.         While&#13;

&#13;
-- ia partly attributable to the work of the Bank and to your own work            OLIVER:    Could we come back now a bit specifically to the years '.63-68&#13;
&#13;
with tbia consultative group during tbeae yeara?                                  in the biltory of the Bank.      I would like to ask two major categories&#13;
&#13;
LEJEUHE:    Well, I think, that would be stretching it.      ~be   fact ie that   of queationa.    You muat have worked very cloaely with George Woods&#13;
&#13;
the Green Revolution vas already underway at the       t~   that the              during a great deal of this tU.e, particularly after you became&#13;
&#13;
consultative group vaa created.      Tbe Green Revolution 1t..-ed from work       Director of Adainiatratioo.      In connection with that, what sort of&#13;
&#13;
done at the International lice Research lnatitute -- IRRI -- in the               major new thrusts or enterprises can you think of as being associated&#13;
&#13;
Philippines even before the conaultative group val created to support             with thia period of tilDe, either in terms of organization or in terms&#13;
&#13;
not only that center but twelve other centere.        IRRI and the Maize and      of a new interest in education or agriculture -- that sort of thing?&#13;
&#13;
Wheat Improvement Center --    CIMMY~   -- in Mexico bad developed new high-      LEJEUNE:    If one looks back over the history of the Bank, one can see&#13;
&#13;
yielding varieties of rice and wheat.       Between them, these new rice          that it has been an evolving institution since the very beginning; and,&#13;
&#13;
varieties and wheat varietiea had already got the Green Revolution                although emphasis may have changed from time to time under various&#13;
&#13;
going before the Bank   R!Â£~    bad anything to do with it.        But that was   presidents, some of the changes that came about started before a&#13;
&#13;
only the beginning, and it can be aaid that the leadership of the Bank.           particular president and may have come to fullness afterwards.      So it&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                     9                                                                                    10&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
ia a little bard to say vbo vaa reaponaible for vbat and when. George            guidance to really move the Bank forward.         this waa a very   import~nt&#13;
&#13;
Woods served a aborter tV.e than either bia predecessor or McNa.ara              departure and of course waa followed up even more strongly by McNamara&#13;
&#13;
wbo   followed bU., 10 be bad leaa of an opportunity to aake a1 aucb of          after be came into the job.        I think Woods can take credit for -- be&#13;
an U.pact on the Bank aa they did.                                               given credit for -- having seen what could be done and ensuring it took&#13;
&#13;
      I think agriculture ia an   ~portant   ex..ple. The Bank bad done          place in the early years.     It   wasn'~   allowed to be stalled by obviously&#13;
very little in aariculture in the early yeara; and it waa only when              very difficult probleaa -- the initial inexperience of the Bank and so&#13;
Gene Black began to aake tripa around Africa -- be aade two or three             on.   That'~   one aspect of Woods'1 influence.&#13;
&#13;
tripe around Africa tovarda the end -- that be beaan to understand, aa                 Secondly (I cannot apeak about this with much personal knowledge&#13;
&#13;
aoâ&#128;¢e of ua on the ataff bad been telling     b~.   that the Bank waa oot         because I spent moat of ay tU.e under Woods in an administrative&#13;
&#13;
goiug to aake any   ~pact   on the continent of Africa unless it sot             capacity and 10 waan',t cloâ&#128;¢e to the operational aide of the Bank), it&#13;
&#13;

&#13;
I diecuaaed this with hi., and when be returned be beaan a new                   when I later headed the department dealing with the Middle East and&#13;

that the French were not particularly eager, but the otherâ&#128;¢ were very                  Of course the major problem in his time was making sure that the&#13;

favorable.    So changea were introduced.    One of the things that got          International Development Association waa replenished and expanded, and&#13;
&#13;
ttarted at the end of Black',a tiae was to build up the Bank'.â&#128;¢ capacity         I know be had many difficulties over that. I was not a party to what&#13;
&#13;
to deal with agriculture projects.     By the   t~   George Wbods came           could be done about it.     There ia nothing I can say which is very&#13;
&#13;
aboard, the capacity was in place ao that it was possible under his              illuminating on that score. although it is my feeling that he had a&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                           11                                                                            12&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
tough tiae. Hia relationabipa vitb the U. S. Treaaury were not                      lending.    But, to begin with, this concern was mainly   articulate~     in&#13;
&#13;
particularly good, through oo fault of hia own, aa far aa 1 am aware.               the desire to be sure that the countries were creditworthy for the&#13;
&#13;
MOreover, tovarda the end of hia     te~.        the United States vas becoaiog     ..ounts which were being lent to thea       that they would have the&#13;
&#13;
extremely difficult about granting the Bank, aa diatinct fro. IDl, tbe              potential to repay.     Therefore, there was a strong emphasis on their&#13;
&#13;
authority to raise aoney in the     u.   S. Market.     So the reaourcea of the     capacity to export and what their export receipts would be.      People&#13;
&#13;
Bank bec ..e conatrained, and the srowtb of tbe ataff of the Bank began             tended to think of creditworthiness in very narrow terms of the ratio&#13;
&#13;
to become conatrained aa a reault.        Tbia vaa quite a aerioua problea          between export earniogs aod debt service, and so on.&#13;
&#13;
during bia    reg~e   which vaa bard to deal with and I know went very much              I can reme.ber a very sad occasion when I was a loan officer&#13;
&#13;
againat tbe grain with     h~.   for be vaa a aan vbo caae into the Bank            concerned with France. and it was ay duty to tell the French financial&#13;
&#13;
with a atrong feelina of what tbe Bank abould do and be took a 1tand                attachE, at the Embassy in Washington that the Bank 1 after careful&#13;
&#13;
about what it abould do.      He vaa thwarted by tbe United Statea.                 study. bad coae to the conclusion that France vas no longer&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Do you know very .ucb about the personal relations between               creditworthy; we veren'_t going to lend them any more money. That shows&#13;
&#13;
Woods and the Treaaury     Depar~ent,    or between Wbods and people in             you bow ridiculous we got at soae times.&#13;
&#13;
Coogresa duriog thia tiae period?                                                       Aa   t~e   vent on our interest in economics became much more&#13;
&#13;
LEJEUNE:     No.   But I know it vas a difficult period.                            sophisticated. and I think Woods was a promoter of the idea that the&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    I understand there waa a quite aubatantial increaae in                   Bank bad a great deal more to consider in the economic area than just&#13;
&#13;
peraonnel dealing with ecooo.ica,        let'~    aay econo.ista who were brought   the creditvorthioeaa of the countries.      We bad already started on the&#13;
&#13;
into the Bank either to work in the area          depar~enta   or in the            surveys of the econo.iea of selected developing countries.       A number of&#13;
&#13;
Ecoaa.ics Departaent, and I think you auat have bad a fair amount to do             tbeae were carried out and tbe reaults published by the Johns Ropkine&#13;
&#13;
as an overall Director of AC.inistration, and 1 therefore, of peraonnel,            Preas.     Thia waa 1 perbapa 1 the forerunner of a greater interest in a&#13;
&#13;
with helping to recruit people in tbia field. Can you aay aoaething                 continuio.&amp; study of countriea', development.    Not only of their&#13;
&#13;
about the reasona for this quite large increase and bow you went about              creditworthinesa 1 but their development plane and policies and uses of&#13;
&#13;
finding the economist&amp; that you wanted to find?                                     resources and so on 1 aa well as consideration of some of these matters&#13;
&#13;
LEJEUNE:     Well the Bank 1 of course. from the beginning had been very            on a global scale.     The Economics Department. especially in&#13;
&#13;
much concerned with the economies of the countries to which it waa&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                          13                                                                           14&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
the early yeara, bad been concerned with creditwortbineaa and co..odity        and the country relations aide, waa the Loan Committee --      headed in&#13;
&#13;
atudiea and tbioia of that nature, eo.modity atudiea of courae being           the early days by the Loan Director and subaequently by the Vice&#13;
&#13;
particularly relevant to tbe proapecta for export earnioga.           Raving   President responsible for operations.    This committee met regularly to&#13;
&#13;
thi1 rather narrow focua in the early yeara and having been broken             consider all loan operations and to consider loan policy matters.        It&#13;
&#13;
looae from the operational aide of things when the creditvortbineaa            also reviewed matters of project policy.    Quite a lot of people in the&#13;
&#13;
function vaa taken over by the Area    Depar~enta,    the Econoaica            Bank at senior levels were aembera of tbia committee.      All the&#13;
&#13;
Departaent began to expand ita activitiea to take a wider interest and         Directors from the Area Deparcaents. the Director of the Econoâ&#128;¢ics&#13;
&#13;
to look more deeply into aattera.     to that end, Irving      Frie~an   vas   Deparbaent, the General Counsel. the Director of the Technical&#13;
&#13;
enaaged fro. the International Monetary Pund to becoae bead of the             Operations Deparbaent -- these were all standard attendees; and I woul9&#13;
&#13;
Econoaica Depara.ent.     Tbia vaa a departure which vaa foatered by           have said that. within the staff, that was the body where moat of the&#13;
&#13;
Geor&amp;e WOoda, and aoae of tbe early &amp;ood work in tbeae areal took place        ideas originated or were discussed.     The President of the Bank had&#13;
&#13;
under Wboda. Even tbou&amp;b be vaa oot an ecoooaiat      b~8lf,     be            never been a ae.ber of this committee, although in the earlier days the&#13;
&#13;
nevertheless reco&amp;nized the     ~portance   of these aatters.                  President would sometimeâ&#128;¢ attend aeetings.     I remember Black quite&#13;
&#13;
OLIVER:    Can you eo.aent on chaaaes in the structure of the Bank, the        frequently attending these.    I don't remember George Wbods attending.&#13;
&#13;
evolution of things like the    President'~   Council and the Senior Staff7         The other body which existed was just a regular meeting of the&#13;
&#13;
In &amp;eneral, of course, I .. interested in bov new ide,. aot ezpreaaed          senior officers of the Bank, the Senior Staff Meeting as it came to be&#13;
&#13;
in the Bank.   Did they always ori&amp;inate vith the President and go down,       known.   George WOodâ&#128;¢ made .ore of that than Black had, and there were&#13;
&#13;
or did they -are likely    ~Â·   up froa the ataff in various ways and get      quite a lot of matters discussed. deliberated on, in that group during&#13;
&#13;
discussed in policy aaking aeaaiona that â&#128;¢i&amp;ht include the President           George Wboda'1 tLDe.   I wouldn:t say it was a decision- making body, but&#13;
&#13;
and, therefore, eventually become policy7                                      it certainly vas one in which ideas were put forward for discussion.&#13;
&#13;
LEJEUHE:   Well, I think, one .uat recosnize the fact that the Bank waa        Hew ideas came up, and I think it was a useful mechanism.       It was&#13;
&#13;
a very ..all place in tboae days, and for ideas to be spread around and        Woods~   principal way of dealing with the senior staff.     Of course he&#13;
&#13;
discussed didn',t call for any sreat structure.      Everybody knew            dealt with thea all individually as well.    He used this meeting to put&#13;
&#13;
everybody else, and the ideas came out very readily.       Aa I mentioned      his stamp on the operations of the Bank.     I think he used it very&#13;
&#13;
earlier, the body which waa certainly preeminent on the lending aide           effectively.&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               15                                                                             16&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
     He created not long after be becaae President another body which               administrative matters at the Bank and liaison with developing&#13;
&#13;
came to be known as the      President'~   Council.     Tbia vaa, I guess, a more   countries.      But I think it ia fair to say that, up until Woods' tllme.&#13;
&#13;
obvioue way of dealing with the principal senior officers of the Bank               you bad a President and one Vice President who was concerned with the&#13;
&#13;
than bad been the case before.       Ky recollection is that Gene Black met         operations of the Bank other than, aay 1 the financial operations which&#13;
&#13;
fairly regularly with this group of principal Ienior officera, but be               were handled by the Bank ..~ Treasurer. who was not a vice president in&#13;
&#13;
didn',t give it any special uaae; it didn"',t have any special function.            tboae day&amp;.&#13;
&#13;
WOoda was intent on creating a layer of aenior officerâ&#128;¢ above the layer                  Woods felt that there was good cause to give status to certain&#13;
&#13;
of the operational directors, and be cboae to do it by creating tbia                senior aembers of the staff. so he created the President ...a Council.&#13;
&#13;
Pre1ident'.a Council, partly becauae be wanted to have a relationabip               Among the membera were Burke lnapp. Vice Preaident for operational&#13;
&#13;
with thia group and partly because be wished to give the meabers of it              matters;     Siem Aldereweld, who was bead of the Technical Operations&#13;
&#13;
some etatua vitbout in fact &amp;ivins thea new titles.            Corporate practice   Depar~ent;       Ronnie Brochea who was General Counsel; Irving Friedman.&#13;
&#13;
would be to have a layer of vice preeidente, but Wbode wanted to avoid              The Econoaic Advisor to the President (i.e. head of the Economics&#13;
&#13;
creating a lot of vice-preeidenciee.         lraokly, I don .. 1t know if he just   Department); the Vice President without portfolio, whoever it might be&#13;
&#13;
didn:t want to do it for hie own reaeone, or whether he felt eoaewhat               at the   t~e.     I forget wbetber at this point the Executive Vice&#13;
&#13;
reluctant to pueh the idea with the Board.            After all the Monetary lund   President of the International Finance Corporation was included in that&#13;
&#13;
had only one Deputy Mana&amp;in&amp; Director, and up to that point the Bank                group or not        he was subsequently, if not initially.     It met fairly&#13;
&#13;
bad never bad .are than one Vice Preeident. or at any rate one                      frequently -- I think probably at least once a week.&#13;
&#13;
Operational Vice Preaident, altbou&amp;h it later had a aecond Vice                          Rot having been a recular attendee at these meetings, although I&#13;
&#13;
Preeident for apecial activitieâ&#128;¢ eucb aa negotiating the divieion of                was an occasional attendee when they were discussing matters of       direct&#13;
&#13;
water ri&amp;hta in the Indus Baein.                                                    concern to me as a Director of the A~~nietration 1      I can'~ say to what&#13;
&#13;
OLIYU.:    Who wae that 'l                                                          extent policy mattera were dealt with more definitively in that group&#13;
&#13;
LEJUBNE:    That wae Sir William Iliff, (who handled the Indus water                than they were at the Loan Committee, but I suspect not.        There were&#13;
&#13;
right question) and later MOhammed Shoaib and Denis Rickett. They were              broader considerations. rather than specific operational matters, or&#13;
&#13;
vice preaidenta without portfolio, ao to apeak, though not exactly                  operational policies, dealt with in that body.      Certainly. initially.&#13;
&#13;
without a portfolio because Sboaib quite distinctly was responsible for             status was an important element in the creation of the President's&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                                 17                                                                                 18&#13;

&#13;

vaa that the work load at the Board level waa becoaioc heavier and the              the department directors should make a habit of going to see them&#13;

that way durioa    Wboda~ t~e.    Poaâ&#128;¢ibly tbi1 waa aore due to                OLIVBa:    I take it that in Mr.      Black'~   day it was not uncommon for Mr.&#13;

evolutionary cbanae in   u.   S. adainiatratioaa;1 preception of the role of   Black to meet socially with Executive Directors in such a way ao that&#13;

&#13;
OLIVE&amp;:    Do you recall any occaaiona when there were confrontationa of       LBJBUHB:    I think that ia true 1 though not just to meet socially.        Of&#13;

&#13;
LBJBUHB:   Ho.    I think one baa to take account here of the fact that        nootbly in the Board was to conault very widely ahead of time,&#13;
during moat of tbia period I vaa Director of Ad.iniatration 1 and 1            individually or in aaall groupe. tboae director&amp; relevant to the&#13;

in the Board aeetinga waa on operational aattera vbich were DOt ay             Before matterâ&#128;¢ ever got cliscuaaecl in the Board as a whole, Black knew&#13;

&#13;
good vitneaa on tbia aubject during auch of tbeae three yeara.                 quarters be could expect support and from what quarters he could&#13;
&#13;
     I do diatinctly ra.e.ber that on some occaaiona, when I vaa at            expect trouble.       All pre1identa do this.      There was nothing new about&#13;
&#13;
Board aeetinaa. it vaa ooticeable to ae that the tenaion between tbe           it, but Black did it to a remarkable degree and with remarkable&#13;
&#13;
President and tbe Board vas considerably greater under Wbods than it           euccese.   He bad a way of char.ing the Executive Directors so that&#13;
&#13;
bad been under Black.     I remember one occasion, although I cannot&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                            2~                                                                              26&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
&#13;
there was seldom any tension in the Board about anything.           Actually it   in the middle of this.&#13;
&#13;
was very relazed.      People could crack jokes and get away with it fairly       OLIVER:    If my aemory serves me correctly -- it baa been a long time,&#13;
&#13;
regularly in    Black'~ chai~anahip.                                              but in 1961   I'~   almost certain Morton Mendels told me that there bad&#13;
&#13;
      It waan',t quite tbe â&#128;¢â&#128;¢e with Woods.     He vas all buaineu, and,           never been a single dissenting vote in the Executive Board from&#13;
&#13;
while I cion'1t doubt that he coneulted Executive Directora, tbia still           whatever wa1 the reco111111.endation of the President.   Whether that'.â&#128;¢ true&#13;
&#13;
didn ..1t prevent hie runnin&amp; into trouble in hil Board froa time to tiae.        or not, there surely must have begun to have been dissenting votes from&#13;
&#13;
 It'..a the evolution of relationships.   I would have said that in Woods',       time to time in the Woods' 1 yean, and there surely must be dissenting&#13;
&#13;
day, it bec ..e apparent that tbe Board vas teatin&amp; out ita power via-a           votes from time to time now.&#13;
&#13;
".via the President, and that it was aeekina a &amp;reater role.                      LEJEUNE:    Oh yea.    I think that'â&#128;¢ certainly true.    The clubby&#13;
&#13;
      Tbia was aometbina for which Wooda' 1 eucceuor, Bob KcHaura, bad            ataoapbere baa changed.     There are all sorts of reasons that have&#13;
&#13;
prepared    h~aelf   when be c ..e aboard, both in   te~a   of enaurins that be   already been mentioned:      the advent of In&amp; was an    ~portant   element in&#13;

&#13;

Â·~ell,    what do you think?          Even tbou&amp;b be ia on the phone, abould we go       aareed to it; and somebody on Capitol Hill heard of tbia and thought&#13;

aaaetbin&amp; one would have expected Black to do, and               it'~   certainly DOt    conclu1ion that travertine in Italy was not only better, but cheaper.&#13;

LEJEUNE:     Well,    it'~    certainly true that in my    t~e   we started to put       the Executive Directors, should continue to be in the A building.         It&#13;
&#13;
up a new building wbich i1 now called the D building, and, therefore, I                  eo happened that subsequently, when the Executive Directors saw the&#13;

Wbode reversed    b~elf   and plana were redrawn to accommodate the              the whole thing vas moved to a new level of importance. Various kinds&#13;

Today    it'~ c~nplace    to talk about staff developaent.     There wae ao      exâ&#128;¢ple.&#13;
such conacioue progr.. , or very little, when Wboda c..e aboard, and be               Another example (it seems almost absurd to remember these things&#13;
set out to cbaoge that. ODe of tbe tbioga that be vaa intereated in val          now), the Bank had no proper budgeting process when Wbods came in.&#13;
&#13;
training.     So be instructed that a talk force be put tosetber to atudy        It was a very casual process.   The Controller of the Bank, who was also&#13;
&#13;
what sbould be done about training in the Bank, and I happened to be             responsible for the budget, would go around with one or two people of&#13;
&#13;
chosen to be cbairaaa of that task force.       I was deputy director of one     his staff and visit the directors.    Be would spend a half an hour once&#13;
&#13;
of the operational departaenta at the    t~e.      I and four or five other      a year with each of them saying, ''Well now, what do you need for nell'.t&#13;
&#13;
aeabera of the staff spent aeveral .antba working on tbia and caae up            year?" And that would be the basis for completing the budget.        Well, I&#13;
&#13;
with a report.     WOoda vaa very taken with it.     In fact, be later said      felt in â&#128;¢Y responsibilities, as Director of Administration, that this&#13;
&#13;
it waa one of the beat things be bad aeen coae out of tbe Bank during            was inadequate, so I recommended to Woods that we create a budget unit,&#13;
the time when be was there.                                                      or a budget deparbaent, in the Bank with a more modern approach to this&#13;
        This, I think, aboved that be not only cared about people, because       kind of thing.   Well, this struck bUR ss a good idea, and so it was&#13;
&#13;
many suggestions in tbia report bad to do with bow to improve the                done. So that was progreaa in a new era of adâ&#128;¢inistration.       It didn",t&#13;
&#13;
prospects of the people in the Bank, but be also cared about          ~proving   get off to auch of a start, bowever, until McNamara came aboard, and&#13;
the way the Bank waa run.     There caae out of that report a whole              then it really went.&#13;
program -     now called the Young Professional ',a Progrâ&#128;¢ -    for                   Another thing -- again, it seems almost absurd -- the Bank didn'1t&#13;
recruiting and developing professional talent,       Also a program of           even have a computer in those days; it hired time on other people'p&#13;
&amp;#12;                                                               33                                                                            34&#13;

a coaputer even for the financial and accountia&amp; work of the Bank waa               claaa.     Wbode    aet about to change that, and, under hie instructions,&#13;
&#13;
reaiated.       Tbe Treaaurer felt be vaa adequately aerved by the card             we were obliged to think up something new.       Now, I might say,     I'~   not&#13;
&#13;
punch ayatema which were in uae. I bad a ouaber of diacuaaiona on thia              quite aure what waa the cause of thia, whether it vas juat Woods', idea&#13;

the Bank aoaebov bad:n"',t kept up with it.                                         and led to one very, very unhappy meeting Wooda had with the wbole ofÂ·&#13;

        Again, I quote thia aa an ex..ple.        Juat aa iboda foatered the        the profeaaional ataff in the technical Operationâ&#128;¢ Department, wbo were&#13;

LEJEUHB:       There vaa a ataff aaaociation beainoiaa, I think, at thia            later date.&#13;

time.     The Bank hacl been uobappy about the idea of baviaa a ataff                    I think one baa to remember in all these things that the pressures&#13;
&#13;
aaaociation in earlier tiaea.        Certainly by the tiae Bob McHaaara c-e         on Wboda were different from the pressures that had been on hie&#13;
&#13;
on, there waa one ao it auat have happened durioa Wooda'; tiae.           There     predecesaora; tbe difficulties of raising money for the Bank and for&#13;

&#13;
of the principal probleaa waa over the           queation of travel.   The Bank     even antagonism on Capitol Rill to what the Bank was doing.          The&#13;
&#13;

            In July 1985, Michael Lejeune was
            interviewed on behalf of the World Bank Group Archives oral
            history program by Robert W. Oliver. During his tenure at
            the Bank from 1946 to 1983, Mr. Lejeune worked in the
            following areas: in the department of operations as
            assistant director to Europe (1957-1962) and to the Far East
            (1963-1964); in the administration department as director
            (1964-1969); in the Europe, Middle east and North Africa
            department as director (1969-1970); in the eastern Africa
            region as director of the country programs department
            (1970-1974); and for the Consultative Group for
            International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) (1974-1983). He
            discusses the creation of specific country departments
            during the early years of the World Ban, such as the Africa
            and Middle East departments; the idea that the World Bank
            considered the economics of client countries as more than
            just their creditworthiness; and the formal relationship
            between staff, the board, and the president. His transcript
            mainly observes the World Bank under the presidency of
            George Woods.
